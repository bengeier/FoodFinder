{"text":"Rigatoni Ragu is the best.

Arugula salad with white wine vinegar, goat cheese, dried apricots and pumpkins seeds were refreshing.  Kudos for keeping the dressing on the side so we can add the amount we prefer.

The pizza was ok, a bit soggy, the tomato sauce was really runny.   We had it at their Waterloo location and it was not like this.

Will return to try other dishes but our go to dish is always the Rigatoni Ragu."}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING!  We ordered a personal Affumicato and a personal Soppressata with the spicy sausage (it's spicy, too!).  The crust is light and crispy around the edges and the cheese is super creamy.  The Soppressata is LOADED with toppings.  We couldn't even finish them!  Best pizza we've had in YEARS!"}
{"text":"We took our hockey team and parents for lunch at Levetto. Given that we had a large group of 33 people and we needed to be in and out, in time for our next game, we pre-ordered our meals. The owner, Matt, was excellent in welcoming our party and accommodated all our requests. Our group thoroughly enjoyed the selection of salads and pastas. The quality of our food was very good and it tasted wonderful. We will definitely go back when we return for another tournament, next year. Thank you to Anne-Marie for serving us so quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"Went to Levetto on Friday night past for the first time. The way to order food is different than what we expected. We were handed menus, and after deciding, ordered at the front cashier. We ordered the Carbonara, Rigatoni, Affumitato pizza and garlic bread. The Carbonara was tasty once I put pepper in it to kick it up a bit. There was bacon bits rather than bacon strips in it. The Rigatoni was tasty, but could have had more beef in it. The pizza was tasty, a bit more chewy, with good ingredients. The garlic bread had powdered parmesan in it, not freshly grated cheese that would have kicked it up a notch - I wouldn't get it again. Overall, the food was good at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Terrible service waited 1/2 hour for a salad and when I asked about the wait time I received a \"snarky\" remark from the chef who I presumed was one of the owners 
Will not return and will certainly make my displeasure known to others   Not the way to treat new patrons 
Food quality left something to be desired"}
{"text":"Pizza not the best. Tomato sauce seemed like it just came out of a can. Hardly any cheese on pizza. Maybe it was just an off night. Went with 4 other people.  None of us were very impressed. 

But on the positive side the stuff was extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I have been to the other location in Vaughan several times, and use that as a comparison to food and service.

Restaurant space is huge in comparison to other location. My family and I ordered the Arugula salad, the small Patate pizza, the Carbonara, rigatoni, tagliatelle and cavatelli. The portion size of the food is much smaller than the other location, such as the amount of meat they put into the meals. We had ordered a tagliatelle with an add on of lobster which costed $6.50, and we were only given about 3 little lobster pieces in the pasta. The same thing had happened with the rigatoni since there were supposed to be a good amount of meat in the pasta but we had practically paid to get pasta with tomato sauce. The service also was not the greatest, although we understood that they were busy at the time we attended, they could have easily mentioned that to us or increase the wait time for the huge order that was placed in (I'm aware that this is possible since I myself work at a very busy restaurant). When we purchased the food, I asked the woman and the cashier if she can give us 5 glasses of water (the Vaughan location always brings it to us), and she pointed towards an area on the counter where glasses and water were available; aside with plates. Later, while waiting a long time for our food, another couple sits at a table beside us where the same cashier who didn't even bother to bring us glasses, water, cutlery or plates, brought all of the above to the other couple. The long service was terrible- our order was placed in at 17:53 (time provided on top of receipt), where our salad was given 10 minutes after (which is good), however our pizza and pastas took around 45 minutes to arrive. In addition, when we asked about the waiting time, the employee didn't even apologize for bringing the food late and making us wait; she also mentioned that the cook is putting on the food now.... 40 minutes after we placed in the order. The employee finally brought out the pizza 40 minutes after we ordered it. When they eventually did bring out the pasta, the employee only brought out one bowl of pasta! That is so ridiculous since we wanted to all eat at the same time. Finally they brought out the remaining of the 3 pastas, and didn't apologize for the wait time or anything. I was very disappointed and regret providing tip for them in the beginning since the service was one of the worst I've ever experienced. My family and I will not be coming back to this location, and to be honest, are more hesitant to even go to other locations. I DO NOT recommend this location."}
{"text":"Order was mistakenly given to another table.  Not even ONE apology or offer of comp.  No one even noticed we weren't being served til I said something.  Manager sheepishly looked at me when he finally handed me our order 45 minutes later (no that wasn't the wait time. Others that came after me only had to wait 15 mins for THEIR order).  RUDE.  Also, I was the only person of colour that evening so I DON't think it's a coincidence."}
{"text":"Waited over 40 minutes for two orders of pasta, while they kept orders filled for all take out customers. Clearly dining in is not their priority when going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The oven baked pizza is very good.
The homemade pasta is reasonably priced and fresh.
Very flavorful. Great place at a great price.
Small seating capacity and service was ok."}
{"text":"Great GREAT Pizza for the price - quality food! You'll pay a little more for the size but VERY worth it! Probably my fav pickup in town. Casual eat in if you like but a bit noisy. Service at this location is Fab!"}
{"text":"Having been to most the other Levetto locations, I was ecstatic to see Levetto open in Aurora! For this meal, my table ordered the Carbonara and Rigatoni since these are our Levetto favourites. 

The Carbonara tasted similar to the other locations and the pasta's texture was amazing as usual. However, the sauce was also a little more watery compared to the other locations. 

The Rigatoni had great texture and good taste overall as well but again, the sauce was a little more watery and less rich than usual. 

Overall, still a great place but could definitely use some fine-tuning!"}
{"text":"Levetto is definitely one of the better recent Italian chains out there. I have been to multiple locations and they never disappoint me. 
I came here with my very particular parents and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal, which included a romaine caesar salad, the medjool date pizza, and the penne carbonara. 
The caesar salad was not really anything special. They didn't put any dressing on; we had to dress it ourselves. I found the romaine a little anemic looking and I wish it came with  a slice of lemon on the side.
The pizza was delicious, as usual. My parents were reluctant to try it, but they liked it. The shining star was the carbonara. It was super creamy, with generous pieces of smoked bacon scattered throughout. 
To finish off, I ordered a cappuccino, and we shared the panna cotta and the white chocolate tiramisu. 
The mixed berry topping was absolutely delightful on the panna cotta, however I found it to be a bit of a one trick pony of their using it on the tiramisu. 
The service is a little tricky. It is similar to a cafe, where you go up and order, ideally pay first, then they bring the food to you. You must retrieve your own cutlery and accoutrements and sit down."}
{"text":"Just came from a second visit. The pasta is probably the best I've had - outside of Italy and my aunts kitchen. It's authentic and incredibly good. It's simple but that's what it's supposed to be. I tried the tomato spagetti (sorry I should have posted a picture but I ate it lol) too good to photograph. The pasta is made in house. Everyday. 

Salad are good. Dressing is on the side - I wish they dressed it for table service but - maybe that's just how they serve it.  Huge portions. 

The pizza was a miss for me. Reminded me of the kind of pizza they sold in st Marc's square. Thick with fresh sauce and fresh mozzarella. A little under done but I'm super picky about pizza being on the thinner side (queen margarita in toronto is my benchmark). 

I'm giving 5 stars because the pasta is just the best I've had in a restaurant. Look forward to trying the rest of the menu. Portions are huge so pace yourself! 
Thanks for a great lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving pasta so I stumbled upon this cozy spot on yelp. Reminiscent of pastabar in Amsterdam, I'm thrilled this place is so close to home. Pizza was delicious, dough was a little thick for me since I like NY style but hey the home made pasta definitely made me forget about NY anything. The pasta was chewy and tender with really rich flavours and the sauce wasn't super salty. We even got a sample of the panacotta with their home made berry compote which was super good!!!

Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"5 stars for the pasta , 3 stars for the pizza.

Their fresh made pasta is delicious and fairly priced between $10-16. 

My go-to order is a base pasta of pomodoro sauce & rigatoni noodles with added cherry tomatoes, peas & mushrooms. 

I ordered the spaghetti once and the noodles were overcooked and mushy. Ever since, I have stuck to the rigatoni which has been perfectly cooked and consistent in the last 4 pastas I've ordered. 

The pasta keeps me coming back, but the pizza is disappointing."}
{"text":"Love that a Levetto decided to open in Aurora! 

The gourmet pizza's here are delicious. It is almost like pizza on a crunchy garlic bread. 

My favourite pizza here is a fungi pizza with mascarpone cheese.

The salads are good as well but not enough to be full on. 
I recommend ordering a few things and sharing between your group.

The pastas are freshly made in-house and are tasty as well. 

Def. a good change from traditional pizza places."}
{"text":"Local Pizza and pasta perfect combination for the price. The good size portions for sharing. Dine in or take out, you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely place to dine in. Been looking for an excuse to come here and finally had one: friend moved up here and wanted to eat out, so we came here lol

I went in not knowing I needed to order food at the front, so I was all ready to sit and had my jacket off. Of course I was redirected by my friend bc she knew where to order lol. We ordered two pastas and two pizzas, all four items were a delight! I couldn't help but wonder.. How come the pasta is $12.xx? Many restaurants place their pasta at the 18.xx+ range, so how come it's different here? I was genuinely taken back by how awesome the pasta was. To some, the pasta may not have been very savoury, but I like my pasta with minimal salt and sauce that's not overpowering. The two pasta were actually a perfect combination. What I mean is the rigatoni was packed full of beefy/tomato flavour and the carbonara had a light cream/egg aroma. When the two are paired together, you can really taste how wonderful each are in their own respect. The rigatoni was just pure awesome because I'm the savoury kind of guy. The carbonara was different, too light for me but the hint of bacon in the sauce made it THAT much better. I will certainly go for the rigatoni by default, but the carbonara was not shabby either.

The pizzas were also great. Definitely worth it all, especially with that delicious and soft crust - nommmssss. We had the Verde and salsiccia, both with distinct flavours and both a must try option. I said it once and I'll say it again, another perfect pairing. The salsiccia is a tomato/meat based pizza (my default) and the Verde is a pesto/veggie based. The contrast between the two are world's apart, but when eaten together, something special happens! Kind of like eating salts then sugar, this was meat then veggie.. Pure joy to eat! Did I mention how much I dislike olives? Well, I ate them bc of these pizzas.. That's how awesome they were. If you get a chance, pair these together :)

I will be coming back soon, wait for me.."}
{"text":"My visit began with a condescending \"lesson\" from a staff member on \"European dining.\" I should have left at this point but I decided to try a pizza nonetheless. Instead of the thin crust pizza shown in all the photos online, my pizza was thick like a deep dish and absolutely flavorless. There's nothing European about the Levetto experience (at least the Aurora location) and the food was absolutely appalling. No flavour, no salt, thoroughly disappointing to say nothing about the rude, mansplaination I received up in arriving."}
{"text":"Pasta is amazing. Lots of flavour is the sauces. I have tried all the different pastas on their menus and they all are stand out dishes. I am not a huge fan of their salads or desserts."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian one night so my husband and decided to try this place since it had recently opened. We ordered 3 different pasta dishes. Let's just say we were not impressed. I found the pasta to be over cooked but that just may be personal preference. I definitely like my pasta al dente. The tomato sauce was comparable to Ragu sauce from a jar that you'd find at food basics. It was definitely an unimpressive and forgettable meal. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been excited to try out this Levetto location and were excited to see that the place was jampacked. This place has such a cool vibe and the decor is on point. Aesthetically, it did not disappoint. 

[[TL;DR understaffed, long wait times, subpar quality of food for this chain. Staff is friendly and venue is beautiful.]]

When we walked in, there was only one waiter on staff and he was so busy bussing tables AND attending to people. I figured we got him at a bad time and this must be the evening rush (it was approx. 6pm). We didn't get any welcome even from the kitchen staff (the venue layout is open concept so they could have shouted \"Hi, please sit down!\" Or \"Hi, please wait for the waiter!\" However, we got no welcome or direction and didn't know what to do but we took charge and sat down at one of the two open tables. A family that walked in behind us had to clear dishes from the last remaining table themselves. 

The poor waiter was so busy that he didn't realize new patrons had sat down and didn't give us a menu until asked. By that time, I had already pulled up the menu on my phone. We ordered the marguerita pizza and the pasta with white cheese and sundried tomatoes. As I have said in my other reviews, I believe if a place can do basic dishes properly then it is worth exploring other dishes later on. 

Upon ordering, we waited over 30 minutes and started to get frustrated. People were walking in and getting their food (I'm assuming from ordering ahead) but we were still waiting. At 35-ish minutes, I got up to ask when our food would be ready and the manager said our pizza had just been put into the oven right then and our pasta was being started now. I understand that orders have to be cooked in the order that they are taken but I was surprised that there was no communication that my order would be taking this long. My husband asked the waiter why it was taking so long and he responded with a snarky smile, \"Well man, that's just the way it is.\" LOL what? If it's a concern for the customer then that's NOT just the way it is for us. I understand that the waiter must've been overwhelmed with the dinner rush and being the only wait staff so I get why he responded that way. He didn't mean for it to be rude. But that wasn't the right way to respond when a customer shows concern. And if it is the norm, I wish we were warned that the wait time would be longer than normal.

Our pasta came at 45 minutes in and our pizza came right before we finished our pasta so we got it to go. I asked to speak to the manager and politely let him know that some communication of the long wait times would be beneficial as a heads up to patrons and he was clearly understaffed. He politely nodded back and said that the weekends can get wait times of an hour sometimes. In hindsight, if that's so, then why hasn't he figured out a system to shorten these wait times? Is the kitchen too small, does there need to be more kitchen staff or wait staff? Really, as a customer, I shouldn't have to think of these things.. but I just got the feeling that this guy did not give an f about what I was saying as he responded with a \"is there anything else I can help you with?\". He responded nicely but his face just said \"whatever\". 

When we arrived home, I was starving and opened the pizza. 3/4 of the pizza was burnt on the bottom. I tasted a piece and the burnt taste was very apparent. There was also very little cheese on it but that doesn't bother me much since I'm not a huge cheese lover. But, if we're talking about general serving sizes then this was definitely lacking. 

Overall, I'm super disappointed because I ended up having to make myself something for dinner at home. The staff was polite enough and the manager at least knows his cookie-cutter phrases to say, so that's appreciated to a certain extent. If the manager is reading this, I'll say it again: you need more staff and 45 minutes of waiting for food is not okay."}
{"text":"We three people ordered 3 pastas, and a half size pizza. We felt so full, and the dishes were so good, and authentic. Highly recommended this place, and people showed good hospitality service."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for an early dinner on a Saturday night. The service was excellent and the food was good. I had expected more of a sit-down restaurant but it was fine - you order at the counter and they bring it to you. The young people who work at Levetto are energetic, friendly and helpful. I had the bucatini which was really good. I also had the white chocolate tiramisu which was \"deconstructed\". It was a bit dry but a good interpretation."}
{"text":"Could this be a hidden gem in Aurora?! I guess not since my fellow yelpers in Aurora knew about this place awhile ago but I am still glad they took me here to try their pasta!  I always wanted to go to Levetto as I heard they are one of the better Italian pizza/pasta chain and it did not disappoint!

In a group of 4, we ordered the rigatoni with braised beef, carbonara, Salsiccia Pizza and the Verde Pizza to share.  I have to say, I really enjoyed all the dishes but especially the Rigatoni!  The texture of the pasta is amazing, pasta done al-dente with delicious braised beef in a surprisingly good tasting tomato sauce.  Between the two pizzas, I prefer the Salsiccia more, although a little spicy, but they are not as heavy as the Verde which had a lot of pesto sauce.

I will definitely come back for more if I'm ever in the area!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have another review for the dufferin location that I likely had given more stars. So it's all about the growing pains for this Aurora location, so i'mma re evaluate this review in a month or so. However, the flavors of the food here is perfect, just like any other Levetto, however this location hasn't quite mastered the cook on the pizza's, and I find the same issue with the pasta being hit or miss, over or undercooked some times. This will take time to work out at this new location and I will keep going because it's close to me and it's still way better then any other pasta place (i want to smack myself for trying east side marios the other weekend donw the st from Levetto, but thats a diff story)... so keep giving this place a chance, it's still so tasty!"}
{"text":"This place should be bigger.  I suspect they will need the space.  The pizza is one thing, but the pastas really got my attention.  I tried the Bucatini ($12), with its beautifully done pasta, guanciale, sautéed red onion, chili flake, spicy tomato sauce an herbs.  It tasted like a cross between Italian fine dining and mama's home cooking.

I also had a chance to acquire the \"I can't finish this\" portion of a friend's bowl of Carbonara.  It was equally as good! And of course I purloined a taste of the Affumicato pizza.  What's not to like about smoked bacon, mozzarella and mushrooms other than me stealing a slice of your pizza...

Levetto has a really social vibe, with big, family sized tables, crowded together so you have great opportunities to see what others are eating, and to pass the condiments from table to table as needed.

Be warned:  this location is in a new mall with a tiny parking lot.  Since it shares space with Chocolate Favoris, the parking lot is already jammed and the other retail spaces haven't been occupied yet.  Judging by the food at Levetto, the parking lot will be as full as the tables..."}
{"text":"Finally some solid options for lunch in Aurora!   Working up in Aurora and trying to find spots for a quick lunch (take outs) is hard to do but I was so happy when I saw this place was open!  According to the server it's been open for 4 months!  It's a bit hidden as the strip plaza they are building is right now mainly empty and this is kinda tucked in  (it's located right across the Loblaws Superstore on Bayview).

For a quick takeout I ordered the small (4 pieces) pizza - Margherita pizza.  I like simplicity and the hints of basil and the headiness of the sauce.  4 pieces is good enough for me to tide me over until dinner.  I also ordered the spaghetti pomodoro - tomato sauce, garlic infused oil, grana padano cheese.   Once again I was looking for simple comfort food to eat on my couch while watching pure trash tv  :)

The inside décor is rustic and nice - there is plenty of seating and can definitely hold a team lunch here as they have long tables to accommodate.

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of Levetto (still am) but our favourite pasta we usually order at the Vaughan location (carbonara) tasted completely different here! It was bland and the sauce was strangely clumpy, it was also lacking meat. It did not taste like the carbonara we were typically served at other Levettos, or any carbonara at all for that matter. Our other favourite is the funghi pizza, this tasted the same which was a nice relief. We were so thrilled to discover a new Levetto opening up so close to our home. Even though our favourite pasta wasn't up to par, the pizza is worth going for along with the rigatoni!"}
{"text":"I really hesitated posting this, but I've decided to to this because it will be my last time going to this place.  Originally when they've first opened I would go there with my family at least twice a month.  I would usually spend over $50.00 with two orders of pasta dishes, salad, and a pizza.  Well.... after almost 6 months of not able to attend to the place due to personal reasons....  my kids wanted to go to Levetto!  What a good idea, I thought.  It was actually on Valentines Day at around 6:15pm and they were busy than usual and received a lot of orders for take-out.  I patiently waited for our order to come, and after 30 minutes I've reminded the waitress that our order has not arrived yet.  We waited for another 30 minutes and I had to again remind the waitress our order has not come!  My two little ones were hungry and getting impatient and I was frustrated as they will be late for their their swimming lessons for 8pm.  By the time our meal arrived it was already 7:15pm.  I didn't cause a scene but I know I will never come back here again, and I'll be embarrassed to recommend this place to my friends.  I'm sorry to say but service has been downhill...."}
{"text":"The pasta is fresh and the pizza dough is airy and light. Wonderful and delicious food. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A few minor changes from the other locations. 

This one is well set-up as a self-serve for your own table,with plenty of cutlery and plates to get yourself.

The space is wonderfully spacious and with plenty of seating for all.

The menu is only slightly difference to where they have added a few more things to the pasta menu. 

Service is pretty pleasant and I haven't yet experienced bad service here. 

Their pizza is good. But in all honestly, their pastas are the true winners here. The family favorite is their Carbonara; which,according the husband, will ruin you for other Carbonaras out there. 

They do do plenty of take out. But in all honestly, the food tastes way better dining in rather than out."}
{"text":"Pretty good artsy pizza.  Stingy and expensive glasses of wine.  I liked it and would go back."}
{"text":"For a unique pasta or pizza experience Levetto combines what feels like it should be fast food with a lovely sit down modern Italian experience.  Their portions are big enough to share.  Staff very friendly and helpful for making choices.  

The food is very fresh and authentic.  You're not getting something that was reheated... this is the real thing.  I'm so glad to have Levetto in the neighbourhood.  

The pasta is freshly made.  The pizza is thin and not overwhelmed with toppings.  They have a great selection of eats.  Had the salad as well."}
{"text":"Pizzas are more like flatbreads but the toppings are fairly generous. The pastas were good, simple but tasty and satisfied our hunger. The roasted radicchio salad was disappointing- two meagre pieces in a large bowl of spring mix greens."}
{"text":"I have come several times since it opened.

The food is delicious and portions are plenty. My favourite pizza is the Funghi, so light, crispy and delicious. The pastas are also great.. I love the Rigatoni Ragu.. but as classic Italian dishes..there is not much meat in any of their pastas!

My only complaint at Levetto is that apparently the dining area is self serve.. you order up front and pick a seat.. I wish there was a sign for this as I was quite confused my first few times here!"}
{"text":"We are still new to Aurora and try to find some local eatery. This is a nice surprise. Will definitely come back. Pasta is excellent."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, overall good dining experience~ Ordered the fennel salad, rigatoni ragu and the pea pesto cavatelli.  Both pastas were good but I was really pleasantly surprised by the pea pesto cavatelli. Very interesting flavours.  Not much service but I didn't mind it as that was what I expected walking into the restaurant. it is just a casual restaurant where you order your food at the counter and someone brings it to your table and at the end you walk up to the cashier and pay. Will definitely go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Boy, am I excited to see you in Aurora! This Levetto location is just as satisfying as the others... they use fresh ingredients and make everything from scratch from pizzas to pastas, salads to desserts :) You order and pay at the counter and they will make the food fresh from their kitchen to your table. Grab your own water and utensils while you're waiting.

I first fell in love with their pizzas when I was living in downtown Toronto. The toppings are fresh and full of flavours, and the crust is very crispy!

The following are must-try items :)

Salad:
The Arugula or Roasted Radicchio would be a good choice for salad. They are light, appetizing, and pairs very well with the white wine vinaigrette.

Pizza:
Funghi is my favourite one with all those mushrooms! Affumicatto is great for the bacon lovers. Salsiccia is meaty and spicy good #yum! Verde is a very light vegetarian pizza w/ pesto sauce that is not too overpowering. To be honest, all of their pizzas are great lol.

Pasta:
By far, the Slow-braised Beef Ragu Rigatoni pasta and the creamy Carbonara pasta with Smoked Bacon are my top favourites - my friends and I were fighting to finish them last time lol.

Dessert:
Panna cotta with a berry compote was heavenly. It was very light and creamy. The white chocolate tiramisu is probably my fave! The crispy lady fingers bring a different twist to the traditional dessert :)

I'd recommend this place with my eyes closed. The quality of the food is absolutely fantastic! Can't wait to come back to try more items :) Keep up the great work, Levetto!"}
{"text":"Considering I have never been to any of the Levetto establishments I had heard good things from my friends that it is a place to visit.

We walked in and there was NO GREETING what so ever. We didn't know if it was a seat yourself or a order first place, so we sat down at the first available table. That is when a waitress had come by and gave us menus -- when you guys are ready just go over there to order. Interesting interaction I must say.

Think about this. Three females, two pastas, three pizzas a salad and a bottle of wine. I must say we definitely wanted to try everything out! The gentleman who took our order was very pleasant and helpful. His input was most definitely appreciated. We ordered: Panzanella Salad, Bucatini, Carbonara, Patate Pizza, Funghi Pizza and the Affumicato Pizza. (Keep in mind we did it \"family style\" and we had the pizzas in a small size)

The best dishes based on our opinions were the Panzanella salad and the Funghi PIzza. They were both something I would return for because that would be a craving for me. The other dishes were just meh. I understand the pasta is made fresh *based on the video that had been playing on the TV) however I guess I may have had a bigger expectation. Please don't get me wrong, this is based on my own personal opinion (obviously) I just felt there should have been more flavour. I have had pasta downtown and there is definitely a difference. The pizzas were very underwhelming for me. The Affumicato literally tasted like a deluxe pizza that you can get a Pizza Nova or something. 

Overall, I would only go back for the two items. The waitress just seemed annoying if we asked her anything. For the reason I had to walk up and ask someone else for takeout containers.."}
{"text":"I went there around 5:15 pm to order takeout and left empty handed by 6pm. I had ordered small funghi pizza because I heard amazing reviews about it but was disappointed about the wait time. Not only did I have to follow up with the cashier, Mariam, twice, she informed me from the start it would take about 20 mins. So 30 mins passed and I went to ask how much longer and she said \"it's coming\". As the restaurant is getting busier, I understand the orders are piling up so I waited another 15 mins before going up to inquire again. This time the cashier went to check on the ovens and came back to only tell me another 10 mins. 
This is when I got upset because not only did she misled me into thinking it would be be around 20 mins she also wasted my time. At that time I just told them to cancel it and give me a refund. To make matter even worst, when the manager came by to give me the refund, not only was he not apologetic, he said it was my fault for not giving them my name when it was never asked to begin with. This is by far the worst customer experience I have encounter in all the levetto location and I will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I went there and we tried the pizza and salad.  We tried two of the pizzas and two of the salads.  The pizzas had a thick light crust which was delicious.  Everything was very fresh and was made for each order. 

You need to put your order at the cash register and have a seat and they will bring the food to you.  It wasn't very clear to us and we waited a few minutes for someone to come over and take our order.  Fortunately one of the staff came over and explained the process to us.

We will definitely go back to try another one of their pizza's and to try the other salads that they are offering. The prices are very reasonable.

I believe this is the best pizza that we've had in Aurora."}
{"text":"Love the combination of ingredients for pizza !!!! Great little plaza with hidden gem.  
Inwas there for the elite event and the food is just great. I didn't have chance to try the pasta but the pizza is great. Some are sweet and savory and some are traditional.  We also have chance to try the panna cotta but I find the texture is a bit harder than usual.  
The great thing about going to this resturant is that you can satisfy your sweet tooth with the interesting chocolate and ice cream shop in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Food was 3/5, but the service brings them up to a 4/5. My acquaintance and I ordered the Carbonara pasta and the Funghi pizza. 

My acquaintance unfortunately did not want to share the dishes cause she doesn't like pizza (WHAT?!) so I ended up only having a few bites of her Carbonara. From the few bites, I thought the pasta dish tasted quite \"homemade\"--It was good, but there wasn't enough salt (and I usually prefer lower salt dishes) which I believe made the dish lack flavour. 

The Funghi pizza had a very lovely mushroom smell and flavour (I might even describe it as a \"truffle\" flavour) that I really enjoyed. There was the right amount of toppings and cheese and it was quite delicious. As others have noted, their crust is not your usual thin crust; I would describe it as a flatbread with the spongey/sourdough bread texture (without the sour taste, of course). The crust gives the pizza an interesting twist, but does not taste like much. 

Overall, I've probably had a better version of both dishes elsewhere--nonetheless it was still a very satisfying meal. As mentioned above, their service made this visit very pleasant. They were very accommodating for my acquaintance and I (in fact, everyone in the restaurant was!), and although my acquaintance can be quite demanding, the staff had a smile on the whole time. I felt very welcome. 

Thus, I will most likely visit again and try out some more of their pastas and pizzas!"}
{"text":"I am happy that Levetto decided to open up in Aurora. 

I had been going  to their Vaughan location and it was always problem trying to find and an open table at all especially on the weekends! Aurora's location is a lot roomy and with more seating!

Pasta and Made when order pizza with high quality and fresh ingredients.

My usual order is Slow-Braised Beef Ragu Rigatoni.

Simple and delicious food. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"So I returned because last time I was here, I noticed the delicious pizzas that were being served. 

Served on wood planks, the pizzas are hand made with fresh dough. I ordered the Affumicato pizza which is topped with smoked bacon, mozzarella, tangy rich tomato sauce, mushrooms, and scallions. Crust is delicious, soft with crisp edges. Definitely glad I returned."}
{"text":"Nice little dining establishment in the north end of Aurora. When my friend and I got there there was 1 or 2 other tables occupied. Once we got settled the seats started filling up quick! It seems to be a popular place to get takeout. Lots of people coming in to pick up their orders. 

In terms of service, a lady dropped off menus at our table, we went to order and pay and get our own utensils and glasses of water. Someone did walk through the tables to make sure that all the customers had everything they needed. 

Since my friend and I had ordered at different times we got our food separately. If you want to be served together, order together. 

The ragu was absolutely delicious and the portion is quite large. I had enough pasta for lunch the next day. I read another review that said there usually isn't much meat in the pasta dishes. I'd say there was about 1 spoonful of meat. Maybe a little less pasta and more meat? (Coming from a meat lover)"}
