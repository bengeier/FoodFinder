{"text":"The veggie sandwich was amazing and staff were very friendly. I really liked this place and I will come back to try their other items. It was a bit pricy but the portions were not Parisian (in a good way)!"}
{"text":"LOVE!! Been several times now, but I can't get myself to try something besides the cheese danish although it all looks good. Warm, pillowy, sweet, creamy with a slight tang from the filling (which they don't skimp on!). Tiny dry store pastries are sad compared to this. I had no idea danish could be this amazing.Their sandwiches are excellent as well. 

Some drawbacks: limited seating (indoor maybe 12 max, 6 outside), parking lot is annoying to get in and out of thanks to the never-ending Verona Rd construction mess, somewhat small menu, service can be a bit slow even when it isn't busy. However, I feel like the food is so awesome the drawbacks don't do much to detract from my enjoyment at all. GO!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwich which was way more than bread and cheese - avocado, tomato and a great side salad. Comfortable spot with good service. Hopefully they can survive the Verona/Beltline interchange construction."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch as we had seen this driving by and then read a review.  It's too bad they are such a hard to get to location, especially with the construction and whatever else is going on in that shopping center.  A small place but lots of seating options.  We had the quiche of the day and a grilled cheese, loved both.  I had a very very weak iced tea with one small ice cube floating in it.  My request for more ice was greeted with a bit of resistance from the server, then a cup with a small iceberg in it came out.....no ice cubes?  Also, we asked for silverware and she said \"I'm getting it\" rather impatiently.  Since it was our first time here, we didn't \"know the drill\" in that we should have picked it up at the counter when ordering.....sorry!  All in all though, we'll be back, the food was good if a bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"It's unlikely I will come here again.

The interior is plain and uninspired.

The menu and bakery are an imitation of la brioche (and la brioche does not even have a good bakery)

We got a cheesecake that we sent back because it was expired, a bear claw that tastes like one you'd find at a gas station, and a marzipan cookie with an unpleasantly paste-like berry center.

Then we got Nutella crepes that came out cold, and bland French toast with lumpy creme anglaise. The berries, however, were fresh.

The service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, and you feel like you've discovered a secret place! The menu is not large, but you get the feeling they know what they do best and they do that! We had French toast, a chorizo frittata, crepes (photo worthy), and the super delish grilled cheese. Good service, good food, fair prices. Great to know its in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I discovered this little cafe by passing by and we decided to give it a try since we like french inspired baked goods. We ended up liking their cappucinos, morning buns and chocolate croissants a lot. On the following visits, we tried their spicy turkey sandwich and it is soooo good!!! and I really mean it. It comes nicely toasted on a jalapeno ciabatta bread, a high quality turkey, thin slices of avocado, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, chipotle aioli and EXCEPTIONALLY crunchy bacon slices, I am not going to lie, it is spicy but what I do is to have the aioli on the side and no cheese (personal preference). I learned they bake their own bread on site and the owner told me they always strive for having high quality meats and vegetables and I can really see it by the way their sandwich taste. Besides, whenever I have that sandwich it really impress me how consistent they are in terms of flavor and texture, which is really hard to achieve on the food industry these days. I wish they had a little more variety on their sweets and also they should try to keep the place more ventilated, it is kind of hot inside."}
{"text":"Le petit croissant is a casual bakery cafe, run by former bakers at la brioche. Everything we ordered was made from scratch, well-executed and delicious. Great food deserves a more scenic location, but all in all, it's a lovely little place.

I'd recommend:

the Reuben (the soft pumpernickel bun was a nice change - it doesn't scrape your mouth like crusty grilled bread), 

A blueberry muffin (you'll never have to suffer a dry, cakey grocery store muffin or heavy, greasy restaurant muffin again!),

crepes with ricotta (warm, tender and slightly sweet with fresh berries and pecans), 

and a giant buttery croissant with a healthy portion of eggs and cheddar."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the French toast with berries was literally the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and had the Spicy Turkey sandwich(sliced turkey, bacon, pepper jack cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, chiopotle sauce on jalapeno ciabatta) and turkey asparagus quiche. So delicious!   Both came with greens with a balsamic vinaigrette.  We stayed there to eat our food, and it was a casual, relaxing atmosphere.  The owners are very friendly, and the service was prompt.   We got a bear claw and raspberry marzipan tart to go (they were reasonably priced), and they were really yummy. This bakery is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Randomly found this place. 
Had a pesto and tomato grilled cheese and salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette made the salad. 

I recommend the chocolate croissant and macaroons. :) 

This is a good place to stop in for a coffee and bakery to go."}
{"text":"Got takeout yesterday (fantastic raspberry marzipan tart) and breakfast today (ricotta crepes with fruit, delicious and beautifully presented).  This is a great addition to the neighborhood: friendly, excellent bakery, nice if basic space."}
{"text":"Tiny portions of quiche that they reheated in a microwave.   Coffee was the standard prices and decent.   Overall will not go back. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Yayyy, a bakery in the hood!! Had a morning bun and a breakfast sandwich, both were deeelish!"}
{"text":"Just stopped to eat at this place and walked out.  Can't comment on the food, but the place was so messy and dirty that we left. There were two huge tubs of dirty dishes sitting right across from where we would have eaten, one on the floor, both on the side of the counter where people sit, half the 6 tables were covered in crumbs and dishes, and when we walked up to the counter we could see the kitchen had dirty dishes silverware laying all over where the food was prepared.  I counted 5 people working so I can't really see an excuse for the place being a complete and total disaster.  We're pretty low key when it comes to eating out, so the fact we walked out should tell you how messy it was. Too bad the condition of the place scared us away from the food!"}
{"text":"A photo in the Isthmus of the Ricotta Crepes drew me to this supposed \"hidden gem\" one Saturday afternoon, but from my experience I will not be returning anytime soon. 

 I came in midday for brunch already knowing what I wanted; the crepes. Turns out they were out, and even though they could have made another batch of crepes, the counter person did not make me feel welcome to order what I really wanted. SHe made it seem like it would be a huge hassle. 

I didn't want to piss any of the three people working off, so I pondered the menu a moment...

It is exactly like La Brioche but a few dollars cheaper. They have salads, soups, sandwiches, and a few breakfast treats like crepes and french toast. 

I decided soup would be my next best bet- and guess what, they also ran out of that. I guess you need to come here at the crack of dawn or everything could be gone.

Disappointed, I ordered the Berry Salad. While I was waiting for my food I couldn't help but notice the shabby interior and funny smell of the place- they need to get some ventilation going in there. 

When my salad came, and I took my first bite, I noticed a moldy raspberry sitting on top. I immediately stopped eating and left. 

Everything about my trip to this restaurant just sucked. I wanted to like it and be satisfied but it wasn't the case. 

Sorry La Petite Croissant, but you have some major work to do."}
{"text":"Have been back numerous times in the three months since I posted a stellar review. I continue to believe that they serve a great grilled cheese sandwich. I have been introducing friends with each visit and today I brought my sweetheart.  He raved about the BLT and brought home a loaf of their multi-grain bread, which he says is heaven-sent. Am delighted that he is hooked. Yes, it's a simple little place and we are simple folks, so it's perfect for us."}
{"text":"Just had the best croissant ever. Buttery, crisp outer crust and flakey moist interior. Surprising quality and tastiness is to be found at this sweet unassuming shop. Well worth a try."}
{"text":"Bakery is excellent. They carry La Brioche cheese Danishes! Great espresso too, dark roast, chocolatey, delicious. Absolutely crappy location, you wouldn't even know it was there without a map."}
{"text":"So happy to have a nice cafe in the area. I have only had the sweets, which are very good. You are  greeted by a hello and friendly smile the minute you enter. A nice coffee  menu and food menu as well. The other reviews rave about the sandwiches so I will definitely have to branch out from sweets. 

La Petite Croissant  is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I didn't. The food was good. Prices were decent. But the atmosphere was lacking. I love a mom and pop shop but it just looked unkept. I probably wouldn't go back unless I was in a pinch for a snack. We went at about 11:30am on Saturday and the bakery items were gone so we ordered French Toast, the Reuben and their unsweetened iced tea. The food looked great and tasted good. Everything was fresh. But there are a lot of places close by that offer comparable food and prices with better service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  Had a Reuben, came on a homemade bun.  The sugar cookie I got was delicious. Food was very good, but ambience and presentation took the score down a star"}
{"text":"This restaurant is difficult to see from the road.  There is a lot of construction and it is in a kind of run down strip mall.  However, it is worth going to for what is inside.  I had the berry crepes and the morning bun.  My friend had the fritatta.  The morning bun was outstanding! It tasted like something that my grandmother used to make. The coffee was freshly brewed.  There seems to be some things that they need to smooth out as any new restaurant does. The area where you order is also the place to get more coffee. This gets crowded and confusing.  Otherwise, I can see this place going far and moving forward!"}
{"text":"Do not pass up the exit for this place in the morning. Their baked goods are at the very top of the food chain.  Try a morning bun. Extraordinary."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to coming here, they're supposed to be open at 11:30 am on Thursday  ...sign on the door says they sb open....but they are closed....And we see people inside...door is locked though...."}
{"text":"Excellent cappuccino but loud rock and roll music was distracting until they turned it down. Add a couple of easy chairs in the front window and the ambience would be more inviting. I'm glad to have a good cafe in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tried the French toast with berries and it was excellent.  Pastries in the case look like the real deal!  I'll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I randomly stopped here with my boyfriend during a long road trip, when we got off the highway for a gas stop. It was a great find, the mocha I got was delicious(much better than anything from Starbucks). I'm not sure what brand of tea they use but my boyfriends earl grey was very strong and flavorful. We also got a tasty pecan pie tart that some of the bottom was missing from, like when you lose some taking it from the pan. I didn't see it as a bad thing though as it was clearly homemade, homemade baked goods have physical imperfections. The cafe interior was a little shabby but the great coffee, desserts and friendly service more than made up for it. It was a great random find during an exhausting road trip."}
{"text":"Be ready for a different mix of cultures that you are going to experience in this little bakery. The baked goods are French. I haven't tried them yet but they all looked very appealing. I will definitely try those when I am not too full from the main dish lol so you know they give you big portion. The menu used to be all French cuisine but now they added Mexican and Venezuelan dishes. 

I usually go here for the crepes. They have the classic Nutella crepe, ricotta crepe and a savory one. The crepe is very well flavored and will definitely satisfy your craving. In my opinion though, I wish the crepe would be a little bit thinner but regardless of the texture the taste was delicious. 

The Mexican and Venezuelan dishes are pretty authentic. I have no complain what so ever. They are homey, authentic, decently priced and tasty. 

Service is decent and friendly. Make sure you check your bills because they dont print out the items you had, just the money you owe. So double check that everything adds up"}
{"text":"Met a gal pal for a Sunday morning catch up and had a great latte and parmesan artichoke quiche!  LOVE the new addition to our neighborhood. BUY LOCAL and visit Le Petit Croissant!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a breakfast sandwich on a recent Sunday. Place was a little hard to get into given it's location. 

Decent, if not the largest, breakfast menu. But it was so hot inside the place, that it felt much better to sit at one of the two tables outside, even though it was in the 80's and quite humid. 

Went with the breakfast croissant sandwich. I would say it was good, but not great. Big portion size which helped, and the mixed greens on the side were a nice complement. But the croissant itself was a little stale, which is disappointing for a place with the word croissant in it's name. Was hoping for a little more. 

Overall, much better option than McDonald's or another chain for a breakfast sandwich, but it is certainly not cheap at $9 for a breakfast sandwich and some greens."}
{"text":"Lunch quiche was ok.  the whole grain bread provided was excellent.  Service was good, friendly and quick.  I also bought two croissants for later -- they were NOT good.  More like tube crescent rolls.  No flake at all."}
{"text":"I'm at home with the dirty chai and eclair I took to go. My kids got morning buns and hot chocolate. It is exactly what Sunday should be. 

Took my two oldest to lunch one day, and it was perfect. Great food, great people, great prices. Immaculate. Quick. Friendly but not obtrusive. I wish I was more of a regular, although every single time I go I am treated like one. I'm really lucky to go.  I moved so I am not as close as I used to be, but I try to make it a stop, at least on weekends.

They're also great at helping to make choices. I told them what I was making for dinner one night and they picked the exact bread to go with it, and they were spot on!"}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice in the past and have really enjoyed my food, but I was left pretty disappointed after getting take out the other day. I heard they expanded their menu and now offer Mexican dishes and pastries - so I stopped in on a whim yesterday afternoon. Perhaps I missed the breakfast menu (since it was close to 2p) but there were only a handful of items to choose from. There were some good looking bakery items (that probably I should have chosen). I ordered the berry crepes, which turned out to be a big mistake. Now, I do take responsibility for some of this. I didn't ask what kind of berries they would use, assuming it would be a few types (and I could pick out what I didn't like). Weird personal tidbit - I can't stand strawberries. Not how they smell, not how they taste, not anything about them. So the crepes come filled with and covered in strawberries and only strawberries. Of course I don't even open the to go box until I get home. And they were completely cold. The cheesy filling was cold and clumpy. I ate some after heating it up and gave some to my dog. Now, the service was friendly and the food was served quickly. I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but not in the afternoon and definitely not for the crepes."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for Sunday breakfast.  Sadly, my visit did not live up to other reviews I have read.  

Walking in, there is a chalkboard of drink options & I saw a pastry display, but it wasn't clear what they were serving.  Once I got to the register, I found there was a menu.  Thinking I would have a wait, I ordered a scone & latte to start, and a half order chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast.

The server place the scone in front of me and she seemed inconvenienced when I asked if it could be warmed.  After receiving my scone, there was no silverware nor napkins around, so I made do.   

During the wait, I was disappointed to see an overflowing cleaning cart sitting awkwardly between the good prep and diners/eating area. 

My latte showed up at the same time as my pancakes.  I was given a set of silverware in one napkin, but nothing else to wipe fingers with nor were there any extra that I could see.

The latte was lukewarm and after two sips, I gave up on drinking it, the taste was just not good.

The pancakes had chocolate chips in the batter, quarter sized chocolate wafers on top and drizzled drizzled chocolate sauce & whipped cream.  Even though I am a self-proclaimed chocoholic, it was just too much.  And unfortunately, the pancakes were dry.

Overall, I ate about a fourth of my meal, gave up and left to give my table to incoming customers."}
{"text":"I paid a visit to Le Petit Croissant a couple of weeks after it opened and came away impressed.  While the menu provides a just a handful of choices and the seating options are limited, the friendly staff, a display full of enticing European pastries and well executed Reuben sandwich has me eagerly anticipating my next visit.

Claudia, who works the front of house, personally greets everyone who enters the restaurant.  As I mentioned earlier, there are not a lot of seating option: there are five two tops and one larger table that could seat six.  The thing that first caught my eye was the tantalizing pastry display brimming with an impressive array of confections.  The offerings include a couple of savory options (plain / ham & cheddar croissants, baguettes, sourdough bread) as well as a wide variety of sweet options (morning buns, cream puffs, cinnamon rolls, éclairs, etc).  The café also offer a compliment of coffee drinks to wash down all of the stellar pastries.

The breakfast menu is available all day and consists of traditional café breakfast fare (French toast, a couple of crepes, a quiche, a frittata and a croissant sandwich).  The lunch menu offers a variety of sandwiches and salads.  Since I am a creature of habit, I opted for the Reuben sandwich.  The Le Petit Croissant serves their rendition of this sandwich on a soft pumpernickel pretzel roll.  While I appreciated all the flavor that the bun imparted, it didn't make up for the lack of textural contrast that the traditional Reuben gets from its time on the griddle.  Other than that deficiency, the sandwich packed a mouthful of flavor, including some heat (the hot mustard type).  While the quality of the sauerkraut and corned beef components were solid, the sandwich as a whole did not dislodge Stalzy's Deli as the King of Madison Reben sandwiches.  The small salad of mixed green with a dressed with well-balanced balsamic vinaigrette accompanied my sandwich.

Even though a steady stream of customers flowed into the restaurant, Claudia found time to check on what I thought of my meal and thanked me for visiting as I departed.  Even though the restaurant is just a couple of weeks old, I felt very much at home during my first visit to Le Petit Croissant.  With all those tempting pasties calling my name, I'm sure to return soon."}
{"text":"I like to have healthy lunch options near work. I've found myself going to Le Petit Croissant somewhat often. I'll start thinking about where I should go for lunch, picture yet another mediocre-but-nutritionally-acceptable visit to Panera, and then remind myself that there's a real, not-Panera bakery even closer to my office than Panera is. 

It *mostly* satisfies the healthy part. Their sandwiches and salads are solid, and I've now brought 3 different coworkers here who have all been happy with their food. 

The only problem with the whole \"I'm going to have a healthy lunch\" idea is right next to the register there's a bakery case of delicious morning buns and cinnamon rolls (among other things) staring me right in the face while I tell myself, \"no, you are not allowed to bring one of those back to the office after lunch.\" 

Most of the time, I manage to resist the temptation, until I don't.

UPDATE, May 2017: I hadn't been here in a few months because I changed jobs and don't work in the neighborhood anymore. Hit them up for brunch today and turns out they have a much larger breakfast menu with a bunch of Mexican items. Very good. I posted pics of the new breakfast menu and the huevos rancheros and veggie omelet we got today."}
{"text":"I was there this morning and saw what happend about that woman Ami G she is the kind of people that just is looking to eat for free by complaining about the food at the restaurants, so go to work or cook your own food woman and stop saying lies about restaurants like this great one. The berry's were fresh as always. And you better never go back,  people like you shouldn't be welcome at any place."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab breakfast. My boyfriend got a cinnamon roll with coffee. I opted for a Mediterranean style egg scrabble and tea. The cinnamon roll was as big as the plate and every morsel was eaten! My scrabble was good, but the bread that was served with it was not my taste. 

We will be going back to try a few of there other items. All in all, it was a quiet little breakfast spot with a lot to offer."}
{"text":"In a neighborhood that had nothing like this in walking distance, the presence of paPer if Croissant is a breath of fresh air. Everything my husband and I ordered was delicious: crepes, morning bun chai... And a great staff. Come check it out"}
{"text":"Le Petit Croissant is a hidden gem! It's tucked away by the hardware store off a busy intersection. I never would have found this amazing place without Yelp...you wouldn't notice it if you're driving by, and it's challenging to get to because of the busy intersection. It's definitely worth visiting!

When you walk in, you place your order at the register. There is a display case filled with tempting pastries. The atmosphere is nothing special; it's a simple small cafe with an open kitchen area. The real highlight was the food. The spicy turkey sandwich was AMAZING! It was warm and flavorful loaded with crispy bacon, melted cheese, creamy avocado, spicy aioli and served on perfectly toasted jalapeño ciabatta bread. The combination of flavors and textures was delicious. The sandwich was served with a side of mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette. The sweetness of the balsamic vinaigrette paired well with the spicy sandwich. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast on a Friday morning and what I had was delicious! I had stopped in previously for pastries, and the ones I have tried (cookies, raspberry tarts and brownies) all have been really tasty. Especially the raspberry tarts! This time I decided to stay for breakfast. It is seat yourself and then we waited awhile to be waited on since it seems the only waitress also waits on people just stopping in to get coffee to go and pastries. She finally got to us and we ordered the ricotta crepes with berries and pecans and a croissant breakfast sandwich, both with coffee. Coffee is self serve with free refills. The ricotta crepes were delicious! Tender crepes stuffed with berries and ricotta, then more berries and pecans on top and a drizzle of berry coulee and creme anglaise. I ate every bite. I only tried a taste of the bacon, egg, and cheddar croissant (anyone that eats with me knows since I Yelp their food is free game for me to taste!) but I thought it was really tasty. The sandwich comes with greens. I am not a huge fan of greens for breakfast, but the sandwich is gigantic, so just eating that would be fine with me. They do a brisk business of both people dining in and people carrying out. Service is pretty laid back, but if you are not in a hurry, and want some good food, this place is worth trying. Hope they do well."}
