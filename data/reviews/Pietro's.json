{"text":"Disappointed in menu selection......and to be charged for extra bread....are you kidding me...wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant located at Eagle Mountain Inn.  Good food friendly staff.  Open 4PM to 9 PM."}
{"text":"I have never made a review but felt I needed to here We were looking for somewhere to go to dinner and were tired of the Fountain Hills regular places and found Pietras on yelp. What a treat for us. Just recently opened and not very well known because it is out of the way at the Inn and Eagle Mountain. We tried the scallops and shrimp scampi for appetizers and they were amazing. For entr√©e had the lasagna and my wife had the eggplant parm.  Both were some of the very best I have ever had. Not a lot of advertising done here so place is nice and quiet but I think once word gets out it will be very busy all the time. Peter, the owner/chef, came out and asked how we liked the food and was very willing to talk to us. Cannot say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Excellent husband and wife family Resturant  Food is prepared to order. Sicilian Chef talks with customers   Had  Shrimp scampi tonight. Excellent.   Nice and quiet place to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"We had pappardelle with scallops in the white bourbon sauce. Wow. Do I need to say more?  Bode was our server; the co-owner and chef Pietro helped us design an entree for for the gods. Ok so this might just be the best restaurant in Fountain Hills"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in Eagle Mountain which is open to the public slightly difficult to find, but not far off of Shea Boulevard. It is absolutely fabulous the food is some of the best in the whole valley let alone Fountain Hills. It is owned by the chef and the food is terrifically flavored not too salty not over flavored but just perfectly balanced. It is not a cheap restaurant but by far less expensive then flourish the restaurant at copperwynd which is extremely mediocre and probably 30 to 50% more. Please try it if you like individually owned restaurants with unique flavors. We have tried seven or eight dishes and one has been better than the other."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Fountain Hills! Beautiful setting and wonderful food and great service!!"}
{"text":"I rarely enjoy Italian food outside of my kitchen.  Being of Italian decent, I cook at home knowing the health benefits.  It doesn't mean I don't enjoy to splurge now and then, and Pietro's is definitely worth it.  This chef knows what he's doing when it comes to Italian food preparation.  Made from scratch recipes are outstanding, he is NOT opening a jar of sauce and ladling it on....(my biggest pet peeve in Italian restaurants).  If you really know what good Italian food is, try Pietro's in Fountain Hills at the Inn at Eagle Mountain."}
