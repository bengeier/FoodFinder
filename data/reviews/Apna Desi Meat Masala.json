{"text":"This place is amazing! I like the fact that they have so much variety and are open late. 

I usually come here weekly to get marinated fish and the quality is always top notch. 

Love their Nans too.

The best thing about them is their prices. One of the cheapest ones around. 

If only they had halal chicken and meat it would be so much better.

Worth trying it at least once! You'll be hooked"}
{"text":"I may not eat meat, but I can tell you that if I did, I would most definitely shop here.

Specilizing in meats marinated with East Indian flavour, Apna Desi Meat Masala is where you can pick up lamb chops, goat, shish kebabs, salmon fillets and chicken that are all already pre-seasoned and ready to cook.

All you have to do is pick up the meat, and throw it on the fryer? Easy, peasy, and maybe if you feel like it, lemon squeezy?"}
{"text":"I went to buy some meat and fish here for a barbeque and first they dropped 3 pieces of chicken and made me pay for them and I saw him pick up a weird piece and when I  I went to go check out the other meats he put it in the bag I would not recommend however the marinades they put on are quite good"}
{"text":"It's an unpretentious fish/meat market shop with a line of people waiting patiently for well marinated meat, fish and chicken. The man who served me was Punjabi and didn't speak English! I tried asking him what kind of fish was in the window and a woman waiting for service behind me was kind enough to step in and translate. 

Despite the language barrier he was kind, lovely, with soft eyes, and my questions were answered to my satisfaction. It was Basa fish. One point off because that's not my favorite. Would rather buy a tilapia for a cheap fish. 

But buying, it's pretty straightforward. See what looks good to you and order as many pounds as you want. I was told by an Indian security guard who works in my building that it was the best place to buy marinated fish which you could then cook in the oven or fry up. 

He was right.

I got three bags of fish, two Basa and one wild salmon, marinated in three different ways. So far I've only tried the salmon. 

I let it bake over already-roasting sweet and red potatoes in a 380Â° oven for 20 minutes. About 4 lbs of fish cost me about $21. Super affordable, super delicious. I tasted fresh ginger in the marinade, it cooked well, it's fresh, definitely give it a try."}
