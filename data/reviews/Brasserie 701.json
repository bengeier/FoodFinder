{"text":"Meh  You know, this resto club used to have great food, which came from the AIX kitchen, downstairs. Now AIX is gone, and the food, when it eventually comes, looks better than it tastes, UNLESS you like really rich food. Like really rich. As in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butter-like fois gras. The combination of tastes on the plate is...odd. I can understand, for example, the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple, but, well, it doesn't work. The fois gras plate was equally challenged. The worst was their Christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert, which was essentially a stale Twinkie...  On the bright side, the decor and service was very good (apart from the slow, slow kitchen). In fact, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates - very unusual."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly for out 7 pm reservation. Restaurant 1/4-1/2 full. Waiter was prompt with greeting then seemed to want to get us moving. Asking bout our meal orders before our drink orders. Then once placed the meals came out way too fast - like can it be made to order?  Once meal was served the waiter became less attentive until we had to flag him down for dessert/bill. Coffee was an added thought and problem. The food was good - escargot, filet mignon and scallop risotto. Just felt the tempo was off... hurry hurry then wait"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my first experience here, at the lounge upstairs. I thought I would be as glad to be back for the restaurant. The decor is very exciting and all; it looks super chic and upscale. Although, for one of the first times in my life, I have to comment on the service, which was unforgivable. Everything was first of all so terribly  slow. I get that this is more of a bar, but having water every hour is unacceptable. And I hope our waiters were new... They kept on bringing the plates to the wrong people at the table which gets annoying... And when we had to complain about the quality of the food, the manager was condescending and impolite. I don't know about you but I don't like to be treated as if I was stupid. It's not because you get a complaint that you have to be rude. And laughing at it with your employees is insulting.  It's a shame because the food is actually pretty decent, but I can't stand poor service so I don't recommend this restaurant, at all."}
{"text":"Complete crap. Beef tartar is ok and everything else was awful. Got the drunken chicken and duck confit was barely palatable.  Only the wine made it go down well. Do not go there!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible, ordered a Blueberry Blast Martini which was good however so many wasps flying around and one dive bombed into my drink. The waitress just scooped it out and gave me back the drink. Waitress was miserable if she tried to smile I am sure her face would have broken in half. Food was comparable to a hospital. If you want to go for drinks it's great. However food and service leaves much to be desired. Given the amount of wasps flying around they really like the place!"}
{"text":"The restaurant had a great vibe and the decor was stunning from the outside and in.   Non pretentious place, mixed dinner crowd as well which was nice to see. We were a table of 4, did two rounds of drinks with appetizers and entrees.   What I had: 1. Grilled octopus $15 2. Fazzoletti pasta $22  3. Dessert donuts (on the house)   I found the pasta a bit hard and it stuck to each other...besides that the octopus was very good and dessert was awesome.   Great for a night of cocktails and lounge."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place plus after 1 you can get an open bar for 2 hours for $25 with a purchase of an entree.  For 2 hours you can get an unlimited amount of any basic mixed drinks (Jameson & coke, cranberry vodka, etc.), house wines, beers on tap, and mimosas.  The service is kind of slow but besides the drinks the food is very good too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service. Hats off to the gentlemen with glasses and a beard. Sorry don't remember his name!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Our Server Jessica was a delight, providing recomendations for food and drink. She did not steer us wrong."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill, and now seems to have a borderline trashy clientele, and last time I went on a Saturday night it was half-empty. Just like our server's head.  Nice decor. Drinks are very good, but not the best."}
{"text":"I usually don't comment on service,  But this place was unforgivable, almost two hours before we got our appetizer, and over three hours for the whole meal... and we skipped dessert!!! I understand this is more a bar scene thing, but seriously a hamburger and some fries should not take over three hours!!!  And on top of this, the food sucks. we had gnocchi lightly fried, and kobe beef burger.  The gnocchi was a disaster, no sauce and cuz it's fried it developped a crust which made is hard and tough, not really a good texture for gnocchi. the Kobe beef burger was ok, not worth the premium of Kobe, and it came without ketchup, took another half an hour and asking three times before i got it. And the third time I asked, she just went behind the counter picked it up and brought it straight to me!!! the ketchup was prepped already just there to pick up and bring it, and yet it took a so much wrangling to get something...  I usually don't give out 1 or 2 stars cuz I'm not out to put businesses down but this place just rubbed me wrong."}
{"text":"I have had hits and misses with Suite 701 every time I have been there.  I have gone for dinner there and for just drinks.  Sometimes the service has been good, other times they were clueless (for example almost losing my credit card).  The food is quite good.  There are also a lot of choices for what type of drinks.  The DJ spins some good tunes late at night, but the last time I was there the place was half empty.  The rooftop is pretty cool because Montreal is sorely lacking in the rooftop terrasse department.  Definitely check it out on a warm summer evening.    I would recommend Suite 701 to start off a night of boozing in the Old Port."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday. It was the only place open for the weekend for lunch near our hotel. Almost all restaurants on the weekend open at around 5PM. If you're going into the old part of town for breakfast and lunch on the weekend, think again. You won't find a place open. It might be different for the surrounding suburbs, but not in downtown. A high contrast with Toronto where places are open all day on the weekend.  Location is very nice. We got a table outside with a view of the basilica and plaza in front of it.  They were not busy, but service was SLOW. We ordered drinks and got them 30 minutes later food came 40 minutes into our stop, and it was only a charcuterie plate. So it took them 40 minutes to cut some deli and put it on a cutting board. They did not look understaffed.  We were given menus from the hostess, only to be told by the waiter that we were given the wrong menus, for brunch, when they had already stopped serving brunch. So he brought us the right menu. Once we made our selections and were ready to order, we were told that they could only serve 2 items from the menu, the cheese platter and the charcuterie platter. So I guess their chef must have called in or something. Very disappointed. But since it was the only place open, we ordered the charcuterie plate.  And waited .... and waited ... and finally, 40 minutes later, out comes the charcuterie plate.  The food was quite delicious and the beer was not bad either, though they had very limited selection on alcohol as well.  The service was quite nice and attentive, but again, VERY SLOW.  Would I come back to this place? Probably not. But if you're laid back and like the view, and you don't mind waiting a VERY long time to get your order, you might want to give it a try. It's one of the very very few places open on a weekend for lunch in the old Montreal area, so it's not like you have many choices. If not, best stick to your hotel's restaurant, because chances are you won't find anything better around there."}
{"text":"This place was empty on a Saturday night and looks like it's trying too hard.  Not a place where you'd feel comfortable unless you were super dressed up.  Too loud for the servers to hear you so they bring the wrong order.  It all feels a little last year.  Last, last year."}
{"text":"mouai"}
{"text":"To be honest, I eat at restaurants all over the world and mainly the USA. I had the worst customer service experience I have ever had anywhere that wasn't a McDonald's. I get more attentive service from a fast food cashier than the arrogant waiters at this establishment. If you are reading this yelp review, only go to Brasserie 701 if you want to pay absurd money to feel inferior, have mediocre food, and customer service that was only existent after we called over a manager. He had to personally bring our food over for something to be done. Don't come here."}
{"text":"I went there twice only, for some drinks on the rooftop bar. The first time, the service was perfect (the waiters were quick and so nice!), maybe because it was on a week day. The second time, it was a disaster, we went there on a friday night, the waitress asked us to move because the table was finally reserved, and none of them was at least polite. Also, while the view is outstanding to me, the drinks are quite expensive (15$ for a mojito)."}
{"text":"Pretty cool, laid back night-time rooftop bar in old Montreal. We had a great time here and the crowd was diverse. The service was good and easygoing. The restaurant and hotel looked pretty nice too.   I would go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks after a long walk! We were promptly seated, and ordered a glass of wine and I had an elderflower martini. The decor was super cool, I loved the birdcage chandeliers over the bar. Later on we also ordered a cheese board. Definitely recommend for a shared snack! And, all of the cheeses are from Quebec :)"}
{"text":"went for dinner around 6:30pm on a Thursday for st-valentine's, atmosphere kind of snoby and cold (the upstairs bar), i found it totally overpriced, much better would have been the downstairs lounge which is much warmer, cozier at least for the ambiance, but it seemed closed that day:?!"}
{"text":"OMG. Suite 701 surpassed our expectations big time! We had brunch, I got the fried egg sandwich and my husband got the fried chicken meal and both tasted amazing!!! The drinks were so good too! He got te gentlemans mimosa, served in a beer glass and tasted so delicious. I got a latte which wasn't made properly. The bar manager noticed I wasn't really enjoying it and he offered to remake it and took both of our drinks off the bill! Such amazing service! Surpassed our expectations in food and service. I highly recommend it!! :)"}
{"text":"This place was our first encounter with Montreal food scene on August 7 for dinner. We had chosen and made our reservation  while in California, based on ranking in Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed, but did not think it anywhere near deserved it's high ating in TA. Our appetizers were good but far too expensive for what they were. Our main courses were fish (different fish each). The fish were warm not hot, which seriously impacted our views of the food and service. We think the dishes just sat there for too long waiting to be served. The interior is impressive at first glance, but the atmosphere we experienced in there was impersonal and cold- a place you don't want to go back to.  This restaurant is expensive, but the food, service, and the atmosphere do not command the price"}
{"text":"Late Tuesday night dinner.  Charming service.  Delicious snapper and risotto.  Perfect ambiance.  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a live DJ.  Great mixed drinks especially the champaign ones! The hotel is excellent too!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   The service was prompt and friendly.   The music was relaxing and not loud.   The food exceeded our expectations - it was delicious, reasonably priced and nicely presented.  I would recommend this place and will come back next time I visit MTL."}
{"text":"My review is strictly about their rooftop terrasse area. I would only rate this place 3 stars. The view is nice as it's on the roof in Old Montreal. The drinks were \"ok\" in terms of quality. I was with a group of friends and have tried their sangria and some of their cocktails and don't believe they put a lot of alcohol in them. The service was also not the best and not sure but the upkeep of the area wasn't the tidiest."}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly.  The food and drinks were excellent but very overpriced. The decor and the music made it very chic and relaxing for a brunch."}
{"text":"As a guest of Hotel Place D'armes I was pleased to see such a beautiful bar/restaurant located within the hotel.  My first night at the hotel we went to the bar at Brasserie 701 for post dinner drinks and dessert.  We were pleased with the bar staff service as well as the desserts ordered.  Being so pleased with this experience we decided to try Brasserie 701 for dinner the following evening.  What a disappointment!  We arrived at the restaurant around 6:30 pm and the restaurant was less than half full and the host asked us if we had a reservation, we stated \"no\" and he asked if we would be gone by 8:30, we stated yes.  I regret not simply taking a seat at the bar because we received the worst service I think I have ever experienced.  If they didn't want us there due to expectant reservations the host should have simply stated that they were only accommodating reservations.  Although, in the time we were there people only left and very few new patrons came into the restaurant.  During our meal we had a handful of waiters, no one checked to see how our meals were, and no one asked once if we wanted a refill on our drinks.  Too bad, if service had been better we would've ordered dessert and more drinks.  When one of our waiters finally showed up to refill the waters, we asked for the bill.  If it wasn't for the good food I would have given this place a 1.  Food was delicious and I have nothing negative to say about our meals, unfortunately I can't say the same for this poorly run restaurant filled with terrible wait staff."}
{"text":"I waited for a few minutes before somebody came over to seat me. The place was nearly empty, yet I was seated at the table with the most traffic passing by.... by the kitchen. I was finally seated  quite a distance from the other diners and looking across to a dirty table. It took a while to get my server's attention and even longer to get water. I ordered something fairly simple and straightforward.   30 minutes later, my food finally showed up. It was not as described on the menu and I could not eat it. Bummer. The staff is attractive and so is the space. Good food and attentive service is more important."}
{"text":"Dropped in during Nuit Blanche weekend for a few drinks.  We were told we had to do coat check but when we got in others had their coats.  I get annoyed at paying to leave my coat somewhere when you don't have to!!!  The first few things that come to mind is the place has solid decor.  We sat down and waited awhile for our server to come back with our menu.  It took a bit to arrive and the drink menu is pretty solid and around $10 a cocktail.  The cocktails we got were all loaded with real fresh fruit and were pretty good.  The music wasn't bad, I didn't see a DJ spinning that night and the place was about half full.  I'm assuming a lot of people were out watching the exhibits at this time.  The lounge is exactly what it is, a place to have a few drinks and chat it over with whoever you might be sharing the night with.  Nothing amazing but far from bad.  The clientele all seemed older...or maybe I'm just getting up there in age and fit right in?  Haha  Anyways I'd come back to grab a drink but the service throughout was a little bit spotty."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice night out celebrating our honeymoon and couldn't have had a better evening. Gavin, our waiter, was attentive, funny, and accommodating to all our questions. He made excellent recommendations from wine to dessert. In addition he went above and beyond to recommend fun things to do during our visit here in Montreal. Will certainly be coming back in the future, thanks again Gavin and staff!"}
{"text":"Attached to The Le' Place D' Armes Hotel. Didn't go for lunch or dinner but they do a very nice brunch. Service is amazing (same as the hotel)  would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and the food was fantastic. The service was quite slow but very friendly. The decor is beautiful. One major negative point was the volume of the music...much too loud. Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this place on a Friday night based on Yelp reviews and were severely disappointed. We were prepared for it to be too loud and overpriced, but we thought in exchange we would get well made cocktails. How wrong we were.  First, my wife had to explain to the bartender how to make a brandy alexander. Then when I asked the bartender what types of bourbon they had (because I wanted a manhattan), she had to check. I watched her go over to the bar, pull out a bottle and ask another bartender if it was in fact bourbon. She then came over and told me that all they had was Jim Beam. Either this large bar had an awful bourbon selection or our bartender had no idea what she was looking for. Either way, that's no good.  When we actually got our drinks, they tasted alright. The only problem was that our martini glasses were not fully chilled, half full and my wife's Brandy Alexander was missing nutmeg after she told the bartender all the ingredients. This is may sound like a lot to ask for, but I expect full service at ten dollars a drink.  So in review: loud, overpriced, undersized, understocked and staffed by unskilled bartenders. Do not go if you're looking for a good cocktail."}
{"text":"Great music , great food, amazing decor and phenomenal service ...can u ask for more ? Had an amazing time ! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Food and service well done. Price and delivery match. An enjoyable place, particularly in the summer."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently close to a number of touristy spots in Old Montreal and had received mostly good reviews on TripAdvisor. I thought I had made the right decision about where to go for dinner. Unfortunately I can't say anything about the food because my party was somewhat turned away and referred to the Japanese restaurant next door. I'm not sure if it's because we're Asian or we had older kids with us. Either way, I wouldn't recommend this place for what I felt was the lack of hospitality from the staff here. We ended up at another French-Canadian restaurant (same prices) down the street and found it to be much more accommodating than Brasserie 701."}
{"text":"Quoi de mieux que de fêter l'anniversaire d'une amie dans un cadre aérien: sur la terrasse sur le toit de la Suite 701 Lounge! Une vue sublime, de bons cocktails, une partie de plaisir! On respire, on déguste tout simplement... Service un peu long, sûrement dû au nombre de personnes sur place ce soir-là. On peut pardonner!"}
{"text":"This place was ok.  The food wasn't anymore expensive than any of the other places.  That's about the most I can say about it.  It had a very pretty indoor seating area, but the wait staff was less than competent.  See Moira R.'s review to come."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting appetizer specials! Fried bread with roasted tomatoes and herbs in a cream cheese base - so fresh and tasty. Fried eggplant slices with chorizo chips in a black garlic sauce - perfectly crispy with an interesting flavor to the sauce. We weren't here to party. Just staying in a hotel down the street and looking for some to-go food. They don't really do to-go, but they accomodated us. And we waited on the street side patio with a view of Notre Dame. Perfect. I'd go back for drinks, food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were a group of 12 and I've never seen such a hard time to serve a table. So many mistakes happened when we got our orders. Our waitress should really commit to a new profession. Daniella should be a bus girl.   We had to argue with her because she was blaming us for everything.   Thank God for the manager who saved the party!"}
{"text":"Came here during MTL à table. The place is in a nice location and is very nicely decorated. The staff is friendly and nice.   Their food is however is not the highlight of the place. The soup was delicious. The chicken was bland and the dessert was just ok."}
{"text":"Best Creme Brule ever! The menu was great and I had Piglet Ribs that were delicious. Everyone's meals were outstanding! Highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a sexy night out, be it after-work drinks or a hot date, this is definitely a place to impress!   This resto/lounge/bar is located in a beautiful classical building in the Old Port who's tall ceilings and chandeliers have been revved up with pink lighting and a dj booth. A frankly refreshing break from the tired trope of uber-industrial decor plaguing the upscale food scene, no Edison bulb or exposed piping can be found in sight!   My party came in on a Wednesday night at around 8pm and this is where my only complaint lies- the music was inexplicably loud. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we were shouting over the table at one another but we definitely needed to strain ourselves to keep up conversation. Like I said though, this is the only part of the experience that warrants a complaint!    Now in regards to the meal... WOW. It was really great. Everything we ordered was so delicious and well-prepared! The timing between courses was also pretty reasonable and the staff were knowledgable and attentive. I wish I would have had the chance to try some of their drinks, since the cocktails looks sooo good, but it just wasn't that kind of night. They definitely provide an incentive to come back again though!  Final verdict/ parting advice: this place is definitely worth checking out but perhaps not in a group larger than 4 (unless they decide to turn down the music a bit). Also, they offer BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH(!!!!) on weekends. Also, I hear they have a beautiful terrasse in the summer that is a must-see! In my opinion, these are all very good reasons to give it a try and for me to go back in the future."}
{"text":"I wish I came to Montreal warm enough to really enjoy the rooftop bar but that's not to say that the decor inside the lounge is not enough to make this place worthwhile.  With a few friends, we came to Suite 701 for Saturday brunch and returned for Sunday breakfast since we liked the food so much.  I ordered two different eggs benedict each time and they were some of the best I've had ever.  They know their breakfast/brunch so well!    Also, if you're looking for a nice place to do open bar brunch, they have a great deal for two hours of open bar for $25 with the purchase of an entree.  Totally worth the money and you're in for a great time."}
{"text":"Went here for my bachelorette party and we didn't get our food for an hour 15 minutes... there were 9 of us. It was quite dramatic, although the food and drinks were good but extremelllly delayed at getting them to our table.  The waitress cried and disappeared, the whole [2 hour] experience was super weird."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a change of pace from our hotel for breakfast while we were visiting Montreal. They have a fairly nice breakfast. My husband ordered french toast with fruit and found it fine. It wasn't the beat he has ever had but it was good. The fruit was very fresh which was a nice touch. My Dad ordered eggs benedict and enjoyed it. He said the hollandaise was very flavorful and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I got the continental breakfast and the pastries were just amazing on it. They were buttery, flakey, and flavorful. There was a good variety of options as well. They make a good latte and the prices were reasonable. The vibe inside is contemporary even though it is in a clearly historic building. It's cool! Modernized a lot, but I liked the juxtaposition."}
{"text":"Suite 701 has a trendy lounge vibe in upscale looking building. It's for a young and swanky crowd, for sure. I came here for dinner after the girlfriend suggested we dine here for Happening Gourmand.  The good aspects are the Beautiful decor, fantastic location by Place D'Armes metro, and really good ambiance. We had really good service from the get go. Firstly, the entree was delicious: goat cheese, spinach and roasted red peppers and garlic confit. Nice presentation (as expected from restaurants like this) and even better taste. 10 on 10 would order that again. The dessert was probably top 3 brownies I've ever had. Moist, rich and not too sweet, it was definitely another winner.  I wouldn't say the main plate was bad, but it was definitely underwhelming. We have the smoked pan-seared king fish with quinoa and salsa. While at a glance it looks nicely plated, the taste is not noteworthy. It resembled a high end version of a typical meal prep. The fish was a bit dry, the skin was over salted, it just did nothing for me. The quinoa was a bit soggy and really didn't fit the the luxe vibe of everything on the menu.  I was impressed with 2/3 items on the menu, so I would come back again. The girlfriend speaks highly of the food here, so maybe I just had really high expectations."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Montreal.  It's hidden away in the Place d'Armes hotel at the start of the old port, across from the Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal.  It's a fun atmosphere with a live DJ and a couple attentive bartenders.  It's a great place to start your evening, continue drinking, finish your evening or even a place to just stay at all night.  They are known for Martini's, my favorite!  They start at $10, depending on what kind of Martini you are looking for.  Their food is pretty good too.  The Kobe beef sliders are great for sharing with the table.  No need to dress up, but please, no sportswear.  Jeans are ok.  Additionally they have 5-7 specials, at least on Thursday's.    It's a bit small, but fun nonetheless!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience at Brasserie 701! I came to Montreal for my sisters bachelorette with 15 girls and we wanted to do brunch one day and chose this place. The reservation process was super easier and the woman that helped me was very helpful and friendly. Our meals were delicious and the staff was very friendly. The decor was super cute as well. I would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal !"}
{"text":"I didn't try the restaurant so can't offer any insights other than to say that the decor is stunning, BUT the music is quite loud. On my way to the elevators, I felt like I was taking a walk through the 90s, lol.    The terrace is a decent size but not huge. We were able to get a table for six fairly quickly, so that was great. My friends and I ordered Mojitos and they were delicious - also, quite reasonably priced! I think I paid $7 for the drink, so when the bartender told me the price I had to ask her to repeat just to make sure I heard her correctly!  The view is great, and the ambiance is pretty relaxed. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Our first Happening Gourmand outing this year of 2018. Brasserie 701 was always on my try list for brunch. Somehow, my time never works out. Here we are for a dinner.   When I arrived I was greeted by a friendliest hostess. She took our jacket and inserted them in the closet. When we went in, I was mesmerized by the decor of this beautiful restaurant. We are seated at a nice table. We were super excited to order from the menu of the happening gourmand.   Our waiter Fred was very amiable. and helpful. As my entree I got Sweet potato soup; oh my God it was wonderful. It was very creamy But light. It was really really delicious. As my main course, I got cod fish with delicious creamiest mashed potato. The fish was perfectly cooked. Then for dessert we got white cake with orange. Another beautiful and succulent creation.  I was impressed by the service, the restaurant, the food, the decor and the ambience.    I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Terasse is packed as per usual. Couldn't get a seat upstairs if your life depended on it unless you want to stand around blocking people from going to the bathroom then by all means wait. We decided to use the small terasse out front which was still great, it was about to rain and got super windy so we left to go inside. They had a small table in the back but told us by 9:30 we would have to leave, we left before then anyways.  Food was okay nothing crazy but I enjoyed it. Inside drinks were slow as they decided to make the easy ones first and do the \"hard ones\" after (old fashion, negroni)  We changed waiters a lot so got a bit hard to communicate with them as nobody knew if our drinks were added or not or if someone was making them or not."}
{"text":"3,5 stars. The place is absolutely stunning and the location is fantastic. I came here with friends for a nye boozy brunch and the vinoiserie plate was incredible! The brunch was really good as well. Mimosas were good but very diluted. Main negative was the service wasn't to the caliber you would expect considering how nice this place is."}
{"text":"Went back to one of my faves for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. With updated menu options this place is a great place to emjoy brunch with friends."}
{"text":"If the food comes, it is very good We had a 1PM brunch reservation and were seated within a few mins. The waiter came over promptly asking about drinks order. The restaurant was a mostly full brunch crowd with some open seats Around 1:15-1:20 the waiter came to take our order. We ordered a small share plate to start before our main brunch courses. It was a good thing that we told him to bring that first because our food did not show up for about an hour. The starter showed up in a reasonable time. However, that was the last we saw of food for a long time. The waiter kept on saying, within 10 mins. The people around us who were seated after us got their food, some finished and left. At 40 mins, I started really inquiring. Supposedly they checked in the kitchen...soon. At 50 mins, it was time to move on. I asked the hostess how long should it take to get a meal, she said about 30 mins when busy. I said, this has been 50 mins. It's time to leave. I was looking for our waiter and the Maitre d' to tell them to just forget it. Within a few mins, they appeared with our food giving up the choice to either leave or take the food at no cost. We graciously took the food. Admittedly, it was very good. Everything was delicious. The pulled pork wrap was superior. The crepes were excellent as were the waffles and eggs Benedict. I am not sure if it was worth an hour's wait but the restaurant did make up for their shortfall We will probably go back but we will be on guard for our food."}
{"text":"Nul ! Le cadre certes est joli et cosy mais ...  - la musique est trop forte, on ne s'entend pas parler, - la lumière est ... inexistante, on ne peut même pas lire la carte sans s'aider de la fonction \"torche\" de son iPhone  - et pour couronner le tout, payer 75$/pers. pour manger trois lamelles de saumon sur du choux, un burger et un donuts faut pas deconner !!!  Quant au service, même si la serveuse était charmante, il aura fallu que l'on s'y prenne à 3 fois pour obtenir la facture de notre table (et pas celle d'à côté)  Bref, on était venu pour le bar-terrasse (qui était fermé lorsque l'on a voulu y aller boire un verre ...), on n'y reviendra pas !!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, had to make a reservation for 630pm because everything after was already booked. It's a pretty fancy place, dress code is definitely business casual if not more so.  While the food tasted great, there were a few things that stood out, and not in a good way. They start you off with bread, but ours wasn't even cut properly and was cold. It might just be how they serve it, but you would expect more from a place that looks this fancy.   Then came our smoked duck carpaccio. It's supposed to come with celery chips, and we expected something  like a potato chip. Unfortunately, what we got were more the size of pennies; one look at their Instagram account and you'll see what it should look like vs. what we got. At the time though, it was delicious.   For our mains we got the seared scallops risotto and drunken chicken w/ gnocchi. Scallops - excellent. Risotto - good, but felt like we had better. It was a tad on the runny side and the rice was past the point of al dente, so not enough bite. Drunken chicken was superb - something I definitely recommend. Gnocchi was light and fluffy.  The creme brulee was okay, a good way to end the meal, but nothing out of the ordinary.   A nice place to socialize, but I feel if you're looking for a quality meal you could find it elsewhere."}
{"text":"Flank steak's flavor was really good but kind of chewy. Fries had good flavor but were kind of cold. I gotta give it up to their drinks though they are super well made with perfect proportions. 4 stars for tha dranks about 3 for the food. The service was meh."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was beautiful- lots of chandeliers and up lighting! Service was very slow but I was ordering beef tartare so I was grateful they took their time to make this dish since it is a complicated one. When they served the tartare, it was yummy and presented very nicely!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Suite 701 tonight for dinner. We made a reservation for 7pm and arrived on time. We were taken back to the worst table in the restaurant. I had a view of the hall to the bathroom and we were next to the bar which was quite busy with the wait staff. The service however, was very good and we both ordered the red snapper which was outstanding. But two women going there for dinner shouldn't expect to be seated at a good table."}
{"text":"Not sure I've ever written a review before but wow! Great service, unbelievably good food, awesome atmosphere with the DJ for Sunday, and an open bar? Perfect. Great value. Totally solidified our trip to Montreal as awesome! Helped out our friends with food allergies as well, no problem!"}
{"text":"What was good here was great, what wasn't, was awful.   The prosciutto salad and french dip were great. The breakfast buffet was great - yummy banana nut bread.   The burgers, on the other hand, were inedible. There was some spice in it that was just bad.  The service was good and the bathrooms were very clean. The coffee was also very good."}
{"text":"Suite 701 is located in Le Place d'Armes Hotel. It's a trendy restaurant with a bar and tables, some being located near the fireplace which is where we sat. The servers the night we dined here were two girls that were dressed in shocking pink dresses which were above the standard-type uniform. Our server, Rachel, was sweet and friendly. She and another server, Alison, were attentive and chatted with us and made us feel welcomed. We were given a very little loaf of bread (3 thin slices) and soft butter upon seating. I thought the restaurant was a little skimpy with the bread as we each had 1 1/2 little pieces, having to split the third slice of bread. There's a good variety of cocktails and wine. I had a prosecco and my husband a Chianti.  We decided to split three appetizers for our dinner since we decided we were going to scale back a bit from our heavier meals in Montreal.  Suite 701 has a new chef within the last few months and he does an outstanding job creating both visually-pleasing plates and food that takes your palate on a journey. The Niçoise salad was deconstructed with seared rare tuna, haricot verts, grape tomatoes, olives, soft boiled egg and arugula. I never had a Niçoise served this way. The soft boiled egg had a panko crust and with the beans provided a nice crunch texture to this salad while the olives added the salt and the tuna...it melted in my mouth. The deer mini burgers came as three tiny burgers with lettuce and tomatoes and some sort of aioli. The deer meat unfortunately was dry and overcooked. Deer should be served medium rare and it probably was difficult to accomplish that with the size of the patty. My husband did like them...I didn't. The presentation, however, like the Niçoise was spot on. We then had the smoked duck carpaccio...OMG!!  By far the best smoked duck ever. This was served with an arugula salad. Again, the taste and presentation was fabulous. It was smokey and tender.  We decided since we were enjoying our dining experience to stay for an after dinner port and a piece of their carrot cake. The carrot cake was amazing...light, moist and again the presentation was great. There was a thin layer of carrot cake and then a light cream cheese mousse and then crumbled carrot cake on top. It was like the frosting was in the middle of the cake, but the traditional cream cheese frosting was made into an airy delightful mousse. I'm a hobbyist cupcake baker and am re-creating this into a cupcake.  I highly recommend Suite 701 for the ambiance, the great service and the creative delicious food.  I'm giving it a five-star rating even with the miss on the bread and dry deer meat because everything else exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Try the Pain Perdu for dessert - it is basically the most decadent version of French toast you've ever tasted, complete with foie gras and maple gastrique. And their Classic Benedict was also amazing!  An extra plus at Sunday brunch was sitting outside during the organ concert at Notre-Dame across the streeet. Extraordinaire!"}
{"text":"Very chic,upscale bar/lounge that serves food as well. Youngish crowd that gets progressively younger complete with fake Louies, as the night rolls on; not to mention the LOUD , POUNDING music that forces you to eat to the beat.We were a party of 6 and came in for the Gourmet Fest special, and it took awhile for the first course to finally arrive.Most if us ordered the polenta poutine: tasty,but barely warm,next the main course, chicken again in a tasty sauce, a spoonful of white diced beets as accompaniment with a square,spiced potato galette...fancy latke,dessert was a shot glass of chocolate mousse with a chunk of brownie at the bottom .Overall,a good,not great meal, the ambiance was clubby,noise ( pounding music) level LOUD and kept getting louder with each passing hour,service on slow side,though very courteous. Watch out for the wine,just 1 glass and your bill will be double."}
{"text":"If you're into a boozy, bottomless brunch with divine good and ambiance -- this is the spot ! Cannot wait to return the next time I'm in Montreal. The space is gorgeous & staff friendly and provide excellent service."}
{"text":"I would go back just to be in the room again. What a beautiful space. The decor, the lighting, super high ceilings, moldings, etc...   I enjoyed everything from the food, to the bar, to the DJ! I would be happy to go back."}
{"text":"Great food great service. The eggs Benedict AMaZING!!!The rooftop deck is very nice for parties."}
{"text":"This is a service based review.    The staff kept trying to take my food right out from under me.  I ordered french toast and had eaten it, but I had also ordered a cheese plate to share and that was slowly getting eaten while we were chatting.  Eventually they still ran off with my plate while I was in the washroom.  The worst part is what happened with the bill.  I gave $40.00 cash for a $30 bill and sat forever while everyone else got their credit cards back to sign.  Where the hell was my change?  When I said something about not getting my stuff back she simply gave me a copy of the receipt.  I guess she thought I just needed it for reimbursement?  Finally, I just showed her the bill and said, I GAVE YOU $40 WHERE IS MY CHANGE.  She looked as me like, oh, you wanted change?  Really?  She was going to take a $10 tip on my $30 bill!  NO!  Of course I still tipped simply because there were other servers that helped, but this was a clear account of someone trying to take advantage.  If I hadn't gone up to her to let her know, very clearly, that I wanted my change, I never would have gotten it.   The food was good and seemed average priced for the area.  The french toast was good and the coffee was reasonably strong and they did a good job of keeping my cup filled.  The cheeses were good, but I think it was priced a little high for what I received."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and yikes! Looks like a nice place but Glasses were dirty, the waitress cleaned my plate in front of me with the napkin she then handed to me to use (so gross!), and then food took quite a while but there were not many people there. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for food.. not even entrees... and we had a private room.. I guess we weren't important.."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had an 8:30 reservation and only got our main couse at 10 pm. Filet mignon ordered  medium rare came WAY over cooked at which point they offered to prepare another one but after 90 minutes i would rather go and get a burger at Arbey's. Fiends ordered the cod that tasted like old fish. The only saving grace was the salmon tartar.  Poor experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for our last dinner in Montreal! I researched it ahead of time, and made a reservation a week before. It was no issue changing the number of people or the time of the reservation. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. Great ambience and the music was perfect. Our waiter was Gavin (or Kevin, I may have misheard him over the music!). He was super helpful and completed our meal with celebratory shots for my friend as it was her bachelorette weekend! We received our appetizers fairly quickly; the butternut squash soup was amazing. The food took a little while to arrive, but that happens sometimes no matter where you go. We let Gavin know about the food, and he did his best to speed up the process. We would go back again next time we are in town :)"}
{"text":"Good place for a drink on the rooftop, food not so good though and also over price.  We would go back for a drink but not for their food."}
{"text":"Was staying at the hotel next door... Got into Montreal late and so decided to just come here to grab a bite to eat because it was easy.  I was seriously underwhelmed.  With all the good food in Montreal, this place cannot get away with charging the prices they do for mediocre food and drinks.  Had the duck wings which I suspect we're actually turkey (dry), the beet salad with shrimp (blech) and the crab cake, which was the best part of the meal.  Drinks were overly sweet.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Food: not worth it. The food is very amateur-esque and DEFINITELY overpriced for the quality (i never usually say anything about prices). I don't suggest you eat here.  Drinks : original, tasty and very pretty.  Service : the staff is generally very friendly, but not so knowledgeable.  decor : probably what makes the place. it's simple and cute.  Overall : i would only go here for drinks before actually going out."}
{"text":"3.5 - The manager's polite and helpful demeanor was occasionally disrupted by his slippery fingers with the dishes. A few unexpected spills still didn't 'eclipse' the charming ambiance, good wine, tasty food and conversation. The rooftop provides an expansive view of the cityscape."}
{"text":"Very delicious brunch in the Old Port, with a nice street side patio and friendly service. We thought we were meeting friends upstairs at the rooftop bar but we were relieved to move downstairs when we saw the difference between the menus. Downstairs has a much more detailed menu with more sweet indulgent brunch options. We shared a cinnamon and bacon bun, a plate of lovely scones with creme fraiche and a mushroom and leek foccacia - all great."}
{"text":"Après une belle après-midi ensoleillée et bien chaude, nous avons décidé de nous rendre à leur Terrasse Place d'arme pour y boire un verre. C'est une terrasse à 2 étages avec vue sur Montréal, assez moderne, un peu huppée. De plus,  il y a de grandes tentes solaires, histoire de ne pas sortir de là rouge écrevisse et comme on est en hauteur, y avait un petit vent bien agréable. Les cocktails sont assez chers donc nous avons opté pour un pichet de sangria au mousseux. C'était très rafraîchissant et léger comme tout avec pleins de fruits (myrtilles, framboises et bleuets), en accompagnement on a pris des frites à 5$ avec mayo et ketchup, encore une fois très bonnes, ils sont doués ces québécois pour les frites!    Le service très bien, notre serveuse souriante et rapide.  La seule chose que l'on pourrait reprocher c'est que ça manque un peu d'intimité, on est très vite les uns sur les autres.  Il est également possible de manger, il font même des hamburgers de cobaye, ça je dois absolument tester la prochaine fois.  Bref, si vous voulez profiter du beau temps et vous réhydratez en sirotant un cocktail, je vous conseille la terrasse Place d'arme."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé mon expérience à la brasserie 701, toutefois, il manque un petit quelque chose pour que ce soit \"LA\" place! On y mange bien, on y boit bien, mais sans plus!   Par contre, les bouteilles de vin sont à un prix raisonnables contrairement aux restaurants voisins! Aussi, les drinks, quoique sucrés, sont bons et nouveaux :) !  Pour une soirée entre amis haut de gamme, ça fait très bien l'affaire!"}
{"text":"I like suite 701 because of the rooftop bar, it's perfect for drinks during the summer while enjoying the view. I love their cocktails especially their raspberry mojito and cucumber bash. The dip trilogy with pita chips is the perfect snack to nibble on while you drink.  I'm not impressed by their food, I'd come back when it's nice and warm to sip on some cocktails on the rooftop and for snacks, but I'd go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Was really impressed at the beginning of the night but it all went downhill. Staff was very friendly at first but service became more and more spotty, with drinks taking 30-45 minutes to get to our table. The appetizers we tried were mostly OK (the foie gras was the star, even though it was quite salty, and the charcuterie plate also very good though very overpriced). Main course was a disappointment all around, especially the scallop plate which, for 28$, consisted of 5 small scallops, 4 cherry tomatoes and a couple greens. Dessert was decent though our coffee never made it to the table. The drinks were for the most part very good and are the only reason this is not a 1 star review, though for that price you are much better off going somewhere else (the outdoor terasse on the roof of the same building is a better option for drinks and has a great view)  Pros: cool decor, friendly staff, nice bathrooms Cons: food quality, portion size, price, service"}
{"text":"Fabulous service very friendly staff. Food was fabulous and their cocktails are super yummy."}
{"text":"One of the few outdoor rooftop bars in Montreal and is was a hit in my book.    My wife and I came here with another couple for drinks around 10pm.  We got a great table, ordered a bottle of champagne, and had a great time.  The service was very good from the hosts in the lobby that directed us up, to the hostess on the roof, to our server.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  The music was good and not too loud, the clientele was definitely upscale, but not pretentious in any way.  It was also not too crowded.    If you are looking for some over the top, LA / Manhattan rooftop craziness experience (we were not) - go somewhere else.  This is purely an upscale chill spot to go before you go somewhere else to get your night started off right."}
{"text":"Great for drinks after a long day of meetings and in the morning the breakfast  offers traditional morning fare with speedy service.  O I recommend the duck confi eggs Benedict or the croque madam."}
{"text":"Great Brunch place right in the heart of Old Montreal. The interior decor is beautiful and perfect for any special occasion. The fried chicken and waffles during brunch hours is a must have for sure. They even have a rooftop bar at the top, just ask the waitress where to go! :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancé during our vacation trip to Montreal. I really liked the restaurant. Great atmosphere; perfect for a date night. The food was pretty great as well. Our favorite was the foie gras Appetizer. It was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not sure what it is, because I'm American, don't speak French?  Been here for lunch twice - staying at the hotel, sat by the host in the most horrible spot- ran into a couple times by the waitstaff - basically ignored.....seriously this place isn't that good to be snubbed.  Won't come back, won't recommend it to friends that visit this lovely city.  Life's too short.  Guess I will leave it at that - stay at the hotel it's adorable- just find somewhere else to eat"}
{"text":"Made a reservation at Suite 701 for brunch while visiting Montreal for a Bachelorette Party. We came here primarily for the bottomless drink option - $30 for unlimited drinks for 2hrs with the purchase of an entree. The restaurant itself is really well decorated and spacious. The service was fine and the food was very good. As tourists, it was also a great spot in that the Basilica is right across the street and the Old Port pier is a short walk away."}
{"text":"So after seeing a couple churches in a row, I start to get thirsty. It works every time. Lucky for me, it was the first weekend of the season that the Suite 701 rooftop bar was open, which is ranked one of the top 10 rooftop bars in all of Montreal (I don't know which ranking but I agree with it). It was a perfect day for it, a high of 70 degrees and super sunny. On the rooftop there were couples in jeans, a table of businessmen in suits who must've been sweating their asses off, and a large group of girls dressed up like they were going to the prom with fake eyelashes and the other 8 yards. We got a bottle of Chardonnay and relaxed for several moments.  The service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant. Overall a great place to be on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to eat in Montreal! I want to come back every time I come! Great ambiance, drinks and food! Definitely a younger, modern, lively, romantic, friendly, city crowd!!! Go to floor eight and you'll be there for hours!! I love it! Ordered many bottles of wine, vegetarian risotto which is sweet with bell peppers and onions, hamburger, pulled pork BBQ poutine, and sun dried tomato chicken and cheese quesadilla--everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of the Place D'Arms Hotel.  Mom and I shared a cheese board and champagne before dinner during our last night stay on Friday, July 15th.   Although they had a DJ we were still able to converse.  Very well appointed, pleasant place. Fun and great service."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I sit in the lounge. It's Saturday night and my husband and I came for drinks. We are guests of the hotel and were given drink vouchers and thought Saturday night would be a good time to pop in.   PROS: The drinks were tasty, a little pricey but otherwise pretty good. The staff is friendly and quick with orders. The ambience and decor is upscale and clean.  CONS: The DJ. I'm sorry but whomever hired this person to spin some beats is wasting their money. For one the DJ is not dressed appropriately (white tee and jeans). He also plays outdated music which he plays on a pre-made playlist while he sits and messes on his phone. And sometimes the songs just repeat which shows how little attention he paid. I've been to venues where the DJ can make or break a night out. This one definitely BREAKS."}
{"text":"before yelp canada arrived, i had to go to the streets to find the cool, local spots in quebec.  thanks to an awesome dood that held down a convenient store, he let me in on what he called the current hot-spot in montreal.  made it to old montreal via cab in less than 6 dollars from le centre sheraton.  the lounge is actually connected to a beautiful hotel- notre dame.  i went in and was impressed by the exquisite design aspects that reaked of pretentiousness, but this was deflated when i was serviced by the very down to earth barkeeps that were both very model-esque.  after swigging on a generous pour of macallan, i asked of any jazz bars that were open...the monica belluci doppelganger asked if i made it to the terrace yet.  that is one thing you realize in quebec, all the hit-spots have a terrace.  made it to the eighth floor from the elevator, confused...walked through a kitchen which brought me to one of the f*cking most incredible skyline views i have witnessed.  the dj was kicking some 90's hip-hop- black sheep's blue cheese and from there the stage was set.    beautiful people, very international crowd (heard like six languages being spoken among groups), well-mixed drinks.  i ended up taking it all in, along with a few gin-tonics- which is one of the most ordered drinks in this town and then headed out to cruise old montreal a bit."}
{"text":"The decor on the interior is upscale and trendy but the real attraction of this is place the rooftop terrasse in summer.  You can see the downtown skyline which I liked alot. The music wasn't too loud on the terrasse either making it easy to talk to others.  Their drinks are on the expensive side so this is somewhere you visit once in a while.  I had a rasberry mojito which would have been good had they not added so much lime which was overpowering.  The Jazz martini was better and both drinks did contain a decent amount of alcohol however I still think they were overpriced."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the steak or fries. It's a great location, walking distance from the place we stayed and near Old Montreal but I thought it was ok. The burger was better than the steak."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on a Saturday night with my boyfriend.  The restaurant was pretty fancy and there are cool art pieces on the walls around the restaurant.  The good unfortunately ends there. Our waitress was cold and was not friendly, the bread was cold and the portions of food were minuscule.  We had the shrimp brochette as an appetizer and they were dry and not very good. The sauce that it came with was good but the portion of it was not enough. For mains, we had the steak and the cod. Both were pretty tasty but for 38$, the steak was tiny.  I would have given this restaurant a 3 to 4 if it weren't for the terrible service."}
{"text":"Great location great food !!! This is in the hotel where we are staying this time.  Perfect location for the tourist !!! Old montreal and the chinatown.   We ordered the beef tartare,  foie gras (duck liver) and duck confit.  The beef tartarr is so far the best one I have ever had.  They used a bit of avocado replacing the mayonnaise.  It give a different butter taste.....love it.  The foie gras is very nice with a lightly salted salad and fig jam.   The duck is cook to perfection but We are not a big fan of the chocolate sauce.  Staff are friendly and knowledge .... Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and each time have had a great experience with delicious drinks. The atmosphere is consistently upbeat and definitely puts you in the mood to drink and have a good time.   The bartenders make a hell of a drink and are really friendly. Struck up a great conversation and went above and beyond to tell us about all the places in Montreal we should visit.  As it gets later in the night, the DJ steps it up more and more and it draws a good crowd. The decor is also really cool and gives it a little bit of a club vibe. Overall this is a great place to pre game or even make a night of it."}
{"text":"Went for a fancy dinner here with a friend. The food was top notch.  I had the drunken chicken with gnocchi, which was out of this world flavourful. My friend had the sea scallops and risotto, which was also great. They have a great selection of specialty cocktails that are a little pricey but delicious.  The raspberry and basil martini was on point. The decor is very vintage and elegant. My only complaint was the service was very slow. We waited forever to get a second drink and later our bill, though our server was nice just not attentive. Overall,  I would definitely come here again. Great food and ambiance, well worth the price."}
{"text":"I went there with a business group of about 7 people.  The staff were nice, but interminably slow in bringing us our food; they also totally forgot one appetizer which we asked several times about.  My salad had funky tasting seafood on it an I only ended up eating part of out of fear it might make me ill.  I heard the view up top was good, and my cocktail was yum, so maybe advice is to get a drink there bit stay away from the gastronomy."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that the review is no reflection on the hotel. The staff of the hotel is amazing and the rooms are gorgeous. I would stay here over and over again.  That being said, the service at this restaurant is pretty rough. The food was tasty, so that's why it earned my 3 stars. But the server we had just didn't seem to care. Had to ask for every refill, had to ask that used/empty plates be removed from the table. At the end he totally overcharged us and initially tried to act like it was our fault somehow? Uhh, no.   TLDR: stay at the hotel, food here is good but the restaurant service isn't."}
{"text":"The rooftop terrace is great for a cocktail before dinner to watch the sun set over Mont Royal. Their $20 char plate is VERY generous (and delicious), and they carry one of my favorite rose wines by the glass. Cheers!"}
{"text":"PROs - Staff is friendly - Drinks are creative and tasty  CONs - Bread was stale and shouldn't have been served - Many items were WAY too salty  - My salmon was noticeably under-cooked - Desserts took forever to arrive (waiter took a smoke break) - The key lime pie was sold out. I was instead given a flakey abomination garnished with whip cream. - Decor would be considered classy only at a sweet 16 (I might just be bitter) - Food prices were way too high considering its quality  Overall: Establishing good drink recipes is fine if you're just a bar but it doesn't cut it for dinner service. Though ambitions were high on all 3 courses, the execution was very poor and couldn't be saved even with fancy ingredients. I wouldn't have cared if my salmon was Irish, Spanish or Philipino, I just didn't expect to be eating it still squishy. My date, not wanting to ruin our anniversary, politely ate her food but felt ill afterwards from the overwhelming amounts of salt and parm in her risotto.  Suite 701 is best described as fancy-style food. You're paying a premium for being in a large location in Old Montreal, attached to a hotel and served food on large, ornate plates. I'd like to say that I'll give them another try in case it was a temporary screw up but, with their pricing, it's not a gamble I'd be willing take."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever!!!!  Made it to the restaurant on time for our reservation and was told they don't allow kids in the restaurant.  They gave some lame excuse about the liquor license but we all know that is BS.  Restaurant  was only 30% full.  Our kid is 7 and was very well behaved so it's not like they were not taking screaming kids or something.  Can't say anything about the food since we never sat down but if you are going to have some silly adults only policy, at least own up to it and make it known on your website or open table so families don't bother wasting their time."}
{"text":"Contrairement à Benoit L, je suis allée au 701 en soirée pour des cocktails, donc vous pourrez avoir une idée plus complète de l'endroit.  Situé à quelques pas de la station Place d'Armes, la \"brasserie urbaine\" 701 est facile à trouver et tout juste au abord du Vieux-Montréal. L'endroit comme tel est assez impressionnant. Les plafonds sont hauts, le décor est moderne et chic tout en faisant ressortir des éléments plus anciens comme les grosses colonnes, les arches des portes et les géantes fenêtres. Notre but était d'aller prendre un verre sur la terrasse en se disant que c'était probablement notre dernière chance pour l'année, mais elle était déjà fermée. Une autre fois peut-être....  Notre très petit groupe avait des goûts très différents donc on a goûté à des cocktails, des vins et des bières. Mon coup de cur va aux cocktails et aux martinis. Ceux que j'ai goûtés, le martini framboise et basilic, le Sour Royal et le martini aux concombres étaient tous parfaits. Ils goûtaient ce qu'ils devaient et n'étaient pas trop sucrés. Juste correct. Pour le vin, il était bon, mais puisque je n'ai pris qu'une gorgée, je ne me souviens pas du nom, mais simplement du fait que c'était un Camenère, donc probablement un vin du Chili. Pour le bière, ils ont un bon mélange de bières locales et importées.  Les prix sont plus raisonnables que ce que je pensais avant d'y aller. Environ 10$ pour les cocktails et martinis, 6.50$ pour une pinte de bière et de 8$ à 12$ pour une coupe de vin.  Un peu comme Benoit L, c'est vraiment un 3.5 pour moi, mais j'attends d'y manger un repas avant de changer mon verdict. Les plats de nos voisins avaient l'air très appétissants."}
{"text":"Swanky bar and dining area... friendly staff.  We went for dessert and drinks and it was just the type of vibe we were looking for.  Located right by the Notre Dame and after we indulged we had a nice walk around the neighborhood.  Again, great bar with lots of cocktail options and nicely prepared desserts."}
{"text":"For my second Happening Gourmand meal of the year, I found myself at Suite 701 in the Place d'Armes Hotel - a place I have gone by numerous times over the past few years without trying it and a spot that I will be revisiting shortly for my best friend's wedding. Regardless, one of my friends was sufficiently intrigued by the table d'hôte that he organized a lovely Saturday night meal - and I am certainly not one to say no to that!  Suite 701 is probably best described as a lounge with a full dinner menu - the decor and ambience is certainly more lounge in nature. High ceilings with ornate mouldings, huge windows with large drap-like curtains, beautiful wooden tables and chairs with a few leather banquettes, a glorious long bar, low lighting using mostly chandeliers outside of the purple accent lights, the otherwise all white color palette... Suite 701 is definitely a looker. The live DJ - playing for the most part great old R&amp;B/ soul music - was definitely too loud though. When it is hard to hear the conversation at the other end of 5 person table, you are probably a little too close to bar/supper club territory than you should be as a lounge.  Menu-wise, Suite 701 describes itself as modern brasserie which, when I see that, strikes me as a catch all term for a menu that is quite varied. That seems to fit the bill here - the menu was definitely interesting but an strange mix of dishes. First up, the table ordered two platters of their homemade charcuterie with mustard, grilled chorizo, deviled eggs and chipotle dill pickle. A nice mixture of blood sausage, porchetta, salami and prosciutto. You can never go wrong with good charcuterie.  Next, I got to try the organic salmon tartar with celery leaves, granny smith apples, grapefruit and mild wasabi cream. Presentation was nice as was the execution. I hate grapefruit so while I understand the desire to add some citrus to the tartar, I wish it had been something different. The fish was nice and fresh with every other element working well for the dish. I particularly enjoyed the subtle heat from the wasabi cream.  The other starter I got to try was the roasted eggplant, tomato confit and marinated zucchini pissaladière. None of us had any idea what a pissaladiere was... but we figured why not? The rest of the dish description seemed worth a try. Ended up looking like a spring roll - which isn't what a pissaladiere is according to my web searches but regardless - and tasted pretty good. The pastry was nice and flaky and the eggplant/zucchini combo had great flavour.  Moving on to mains. I could not resist the duck so I went with the duck magret with pomegranate gastrique, charred farro risotto and braised kale. The duck was perfect - rich and fatty, cooked rare as it needs to be. The risotto however was a bit off to my liking. The use of farro, unknown to me prior to this, instead of rice was interesting but created a much firmer texture to the risotto than I was expected - I will mark this down to wrong expectations on my end.  The other main I tried was the pan-seared black bass with Jerusalem artichoke purée, black olive sauce and braised endives. The black bass was beautifully flaky and slightly salty. The artichoke puree and endives paired nicely to the fish. I skipped the sauce as olives really aren't my thing.  Dessert-wise, there were two options - a mocha cake with blood orange compote and a white chocolate mousse with raspberries. I hate mocha so I didn't try it but it seemed to be a hit at the table. My choice was the mousse which was well executed texturally - wonderfully smooth - but good lord was it sweet... too sweet to be honest which is saying a lot coming for a guy who absolutely loves his desserts. The tartness of the raspberries were not enough to offset the sweetness here. It almost needed a cookie or dark chocolate bites to offset the extra sweetness.  Suite 701 was a nice evening overall with a few minor issues that didn't make it an amazing one food wise. I definitely see coming back for a cocktail hour with a bite or two - which ironically is what will happen at that wedding I mentioned earlier - but I don't have a strong desire to return for a full dinner. For a lounge, that is what one would expect so on that account, Suite 701 probably hits its objective. Worth considerable to start an evening in Old Montreal at the very least.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Definitely up there among my favourite terrasse spots for 5-a-7.   The mojito variations are amazing (equal parts lime and mint with anything-but Flor de Cana).   The top deck is perfect. Very well laid out. Lots of space for loud and inappropriate happy hour conversations. Well... almost enough space sometimes."}
{"text":"I had dinner while on holiday, great rooftop seating.  Great ambience. Planning to revisit next holiday."}
{"text":"Très agréable, très bien. La carte du midi est courte mais tout à fait correcte et abordable. La salle est belle et le service attentif. Liste de vins au verre limitée. Mon plat de pâtes garnies était tout à fait bon.  Je réserve une étoile supplémentaire avant de l'essayer le soir, mais je dirais 3.5 aujourd'hui."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place and were excited to try it on our first night in town.  The restaurant is beautiful and we really enjoyed our appetizers.  My wife had one of the salads and I had the mushrooms on toast and both were delicious.  The disaster happened with dinner.  The couple seated next to us didn't order an appetizer but was done and paid for before our dinner even came and our waitress was nowhere to be found.  An hour and a half after being seated, we finally saw our waitress and asked if our dinner was close to being ready because we really just wanted to go home.  Both a waitress and a manager came over to tell us it was being plated which was a flat out lie.  We received our meals cold, my wife's mashed potatoes were rubbery and glue like from sitting around while my duck was tough and barely edible.  I should have complained at the time but we were very hungry after traveling most of the day and just wanted to eat something.  Another waiter saw us once again looking around trying to find our waitress and brought us dessert menus but we just wanted to get out.  There were no apologies and nothing taken off our bill (although I didn't ask).  What upsets me the most about this place is that they flat out lied that our meal was being plated when it clearly had been sitting in the kitchen for at least half an hour.  If they had been up front with us, we could have left or gotten something else.  Instead, we feel screwed over by a restaurant that was fairly highly rated and charged quite a bit for food they knew had been sitting out."}
{"text":"5 etoiles surtout pour le service de Benoit et Tristan (qui se sont excellement ratrapés apres une confusion de reservation). Ambiance tres agreable, tres beaux local , decoration chaleureuse, service courtois de tout le staff, assiettes correctes , drinks delicieux :)"}
{"text":"we have been to this place a bunch of times it is about a 10 minute walk from our place if that so it is convenient  they have serviceable food and good enough service good booze selection and some good cocktails  it is inside a hotel so it is also good for people watching"}
{"text":"Underwhelming overall. Young, cosmopolitan vibe, good drinks and atmosphere. Unfortunately, it's another on of those restaurants where it's difficult to hear what the person even directly across from you is saying bc the music is so loud.   Had the butternut squash soup and gnocchi. Nothing wrong with the soup, but great about it either. The gnocchi was rather bad. It is covered in what tasted exactly like a pizza sauce rather than a marinara. No vegetable served with the gnocchi either.   Overall unimaginative experience."}
