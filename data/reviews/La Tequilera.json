{"text":"After looking for a Mexican place in downtown Montreal and seeing that La Tequilera had some good reviews, we decided to try it out. I'm disappointed to say that I was quite disappointed. I had the chicken quesadilla which was just cheese and chicken, very plain, no sauce. It looked and tasted like something I could have made myself. Half of the quesadilla was just bread and I feel like I paid 14$ + tx+ tip for a tortilla bread. Also, the waiter spoke 0 English. I don't need him to be super fluent but he did not even understand basic menu ordering. A bit awkward as we had guests from out of town. I wouldn't go back and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"very poor mexican dishes, below my expectations. never had cold meats in TACO before and just as what was commented by the last reviewer, there was barely sauces so I had to pour salsa and chilli sauces myself. still tipped 15% which includes all future tipping in this place. Not recommended."}
{"text":"An average Mexican restaurant.  We had tacos and sopes. The el pastor doesn't have pineapple in them which is strange to me. The pork was dry and tender, tasted like fried than grilled. The sope with pulled beef was new to me, and it turned out very good.   The grill is something like Mexican Fajita but with two grilled cheese pita included. The meat was not dry. I like it.  The price range is a little bit higher than other places. The location is at the end of Cresent street but not as busy as other restaurants. They don't provide lemons, complimentary chips and kinds of salsas like other Mexican restaurants do."}
