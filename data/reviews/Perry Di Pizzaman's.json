{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in the area! Without a doubt. The sauce is so tasty and the cheese, toppings and dough are quality. The prices are so reasonable as well. The master cut feeds a crowd and the leftovers are even better the next day. We love Perry's!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of their their food, but it seems that over the past few years, it's improved. Their sandwiches, particularly their steak hoagie is the best steak sandwich I've had easily in the area. The bread tastes fresh, the cheese fries are tasty, and I've always had a great interaction with the staff.  To put it in perspective, as I was finishing off a 700 mile, 11 hour drive from the south to return home, I had an order in place as soon as I was close. I've had their Italian hoagie, their gyro isn't too shabby, but if you're in the area and wanting a steak hoagie, I'd be surprised if this place doesn't scratch that itch. Definitely a hometown favorite of mine that I hope to be visiting for years to come."}
{"text":"Perry's food is the absolute best around!  His Sicilian pizza is the best!  It rivals the pizza shops in NYC!  He needs more help on the phones. You can hold for 3-4 minutes or more just to place an order. Then when you finally get through the people take forever to take the order because they don't know what to do."}
{"text":"We have tried them a few times before and it was always pretty good. We ate their yesterday as a group of 9 and while it was a little chilly inside and overall it's not a bad setup for what is there. We ordered a appetizers of fried zucchini and cheese sticks which came out rather quickly! We also ordered a cheese pizza, a pepperoni pizza, a meat lovers, a pepperoni and mushroom, and 2 dozen wings. Plus drinks for all! First off the bill wasn't all that bad and I was actually expecting much worse.  The food was hot and cooked perfectly! The pizzas came out and the wings right after and all were done beautifully and exactly as ordered! The taste was amazing! It was like Christmas in my mouth! They actually do WHOLE WINGS!!! Yes read that again Whole Wings!!!! We know as so many places do wing dings and or charge you a small fortune to have a whole wing! The wings were delicious! I have had so many places that overcook and dry out wings it's not even funny... :-( Not at Perry's! The wings were fried to perfection the skin was crispy and seasoned beautifully and the chicken inside it was juicy and delicious! The pizza's were all done and each one was like it's own picture perfect pizza dream! We had 4 teenagers with us soooo pictures of food... not even possible. However with all of that still we had food to take home and everyone was stuffed like turkeys on Thanksgiving! I mean they boys eyes were more glazed over than the ham on Christmas!   For sure you have to check them out and try the foods! I think you won't be disappointed. Oh and the staff... while fairly quirky they were all very very nice and thanked us for coming in repeatedly and really made us feel welcome and did an excellent job taking care of our huge party of crazy kids and tired adults!"}
{"text":"Love Perry's!! Always have! Great pizza with amazing sauce.  Their hoagies are also very good and the pepperoni rolls can't be beat. Great prices for large portions! Forget the chain pizza places and go for a small delicious shop. Have gone to for years and will continue to do so!! Super friendly service also!"}
{"text":"So turns out they have sicilian style pizza. About to try one (2) in a large with the fam. If it's anything like the traditional pizza I will be thrilled. The traditional is always just the right amount of crispy and doughy. Always fresh. Great place for pizza. Lives up to his name."}
{"text":"How does perry's not have a review? Perry's has always been a great place for good pizza,  but when they moved to Burrell their service seemed to get even better.  Just quicker delivery,  always hot and fresh upon delivery,  just a higher standard it feels like since the move.  We love it,  it's definitely one of the best older pizza joints in the area.  Great pie size for the price, order perry's,  you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"OMG! I couldn't take a pic of my sub because it didnt last. Their food is greasy but oh so good. Almost addictive.   I love their subs and pizza. I've tried so much from their menu because I've been eating from here for years. I love this place!  Prices are on the higher side. $10 for a whole sub and maybe $15 for a large pizza.   Worth the dolla. Don't expect pretty because this food can be greasy and messy. Grab a lot of napkins!"}
{"text":"The white pizza is a home run  with spinach ,onions and mushrooms if you're looking for a veggie option. The wings are crispy and the sauce is just spicy enough. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around. Placed my order tonight at 5 on the road, waited a bit for it. Nice and hot and it was delicious when I got home! I'm not a big pizza person so when I say it was good, it's great. Will definitely order again. Sicilian pepperoni. Writing this at 6:20. Great find. Thanks Yelp!"}
