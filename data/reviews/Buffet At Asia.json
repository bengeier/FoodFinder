{"text":"I have been to both locations. It has that buffet atmosphere so there you go. People taking what they want and more. My hubby likes it because you get more for your money especially for dinner. They have lots of seafood and fresh oyster that I do not eat but hubby does. I like the Mongolian bbq although I had to tell the man making it to not overcook the veggies. No salad bar and some fruits. Love the baked bananas, yum! Will go back because of the mongolian bbq.  At least I can eat something here that I like. Kids are also half price, yay!"}
{"text":"this place is pretty bad. friend and i wanted some chinese food for dinner and we were both hungry. the price here seems to be decent. not to sure about the pricing for other competitors. we paid and got sat to a table that smelled like a wet rag, great way to start. the seat had some crumbs on it so i just used a napkin and dusted it off. it looked like a busy night so i figured this is a good thing since the food should get prepared fresh and pushed out onto the trays. well it was freshly put out. the food here is eh. definitely catered for the panda express lovers. lots of sauce and fried food here. the mongolian cook seemed to have called off work that since i didn't see him everytime i was up there. he did show up finally, when i was leaving. left the place and got carls jr across the street. reading the past reviews, seems like this place is slowly getting worst."}
{"text":"This is a bad or can call worst buffet in my life .... Does everyone tell you this is a good place to eat .... Please don't trust them Don't waist your money to come over here it's a dirty and nasty place in Vegas ... I don't know how they can stand on business ...  Food taste are salty and .... No words to tell.... Service wow is horrible .....  I am so regret to step into this place ..... I really want to get my money back .... If possible....:("}
{"text":"Asian buffet, slightly above average in all aspects.  Buffet At Asia is an Asian buffet restaurant, priced cheaper than most casino buffets (around $16 for dinner) though there are Asian buffets that are cheaper still.  There is decent variety of foods and there is also a Mongolian grill (or bbq) where you can select the ingredients you want and they're cooked live in front of you.  I won't comment on the seafood as I don't eat any but there were crab legs and sushi options.  For meat lovers there was pork, chicken and beef, around 3 choices for each. All were decent tasting though they were a bit oil/fat-heavy. All of them tasted average, not bad but also not special, about the same you'd expect from any takeout.  I really enjoyed the sweet sesame balls (essentially dough balls covered in sesame and deep fried) though they were kind of heavy on the stomach.  There's also a large variety of vegetables, steamed or fried and I also saw frog legs! (for those who consider it a delicacy, I don't)  The desserts station had a large variety of fruit (quite refreshing from the usual buffet \"cheesecake and carrotcake\" staples) as well as soft serve ice cream, donuts (not the usual style but a deep fried style I didn't really enjoy, too oily and crispy with a sour/stale taste) and cakes.  Something that I found odd (even mildly annoying) was that there weren't descriptions/names in all of the foods, and those that had any description it was just written with a permanent marker on the glass above. It would cost nothing to print some nice readable labels and it would really change the image of the buffet and inform customers what every food is.  Service was fast (the place was not crowded at all when I visited) but one of the servers was.. weird (in a good way). She didn't speak much, she would just stand in front of you looking down instead of asking if you wanted a refill. Now that led to somewhat eerie moments of silence while attempting to establish communication (having someone stand silently in front of you and you saying \"coke please\" just seemed weird and rude). I assume she was just shy and maybe new at the job and I'm not going to mark them down for that.  There's also a sign on the wall that says there's an extra charge for wasted food. While this is understandable in a manner that someone who fills their plate with one type of food and doesn't eat it will cause the restaurant to throw it away, it may also put off people from trying new things thinking that if they don't like something or can't eat it they'll have to pay extra. I haven't encountered such a situation and hopefully the restaurant will be prudent but still the sign on the wall exudes a passive threat.  Overall, Buffet At Asia manages to be slightly above average in everything: price, food selection, taste (some foods tend to be heavy/oily), service. Hence 3/5"}
{"text":"Today I am having stomach flu from this place. Ate here last night for my brothers birthday. Always dirty!! Never coming back here. Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Quality of food doesn't worth the price. Majority is deep fry and the oil was not often replaced. Service is zero. Waitress is mean and never smile. Will not recommend this place. My wife got sick after eating at this place probably due to their oil for the deep fry food."}
{"text":"What can I say, the food its OK , kind of greasy. The servers are polite and nice. They should clean the entrance and remove the coin machines. Well that's my opinion."}
{"text":"One of the restaurants in this mighty conglomeration of restaurants, the menu/buffet offerings here is like the one located on Sahara/S Rainbow, although there are very slight differences. For example, this location had tuna sashimi and ceviche (or the Asian equivalent: a mix of seafood bits mixed with jalapenos) which I didn't see until I finished gorging myself on other items. It's not a mark down, just a lack of observation on my part. But I want to obsess about the frog legs. They were delicious: juicy and well seasoned. And the size of the legs are pretty big. Between frog legs and lobster, I would prefer frog legs because they have a very subtle and delicate flavor. Not to say lobster on their own isn't subtle and delicate in flavor, but having eaten as much lobster as I have, frog legs are a wonderful change. If you're repulsed by the thought of eating frog legs, here's a protip: you're at a buffet. Select one leg from the tray, and only one. Do not take 1/2 pound of legs. After returning to your table, take a bite, without any additional sauces or seasonings (salt, pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, and so on). How's the mouthfeel? The taste? Gag reflex in check, you're not dying because you had taken a bite of a frog's leg? If you feel more seasoning is needed, season away. If you can't continue eating the frog leg, you at least tried. If you can, that's great, and get more if you like. Service itself was spotty. I understand the nature of the business, and I'm not looking for constant interaction with the waitstaff, but nearly halfway through my first delicious plate of sushi, no one asked for my beverage order, and I eat slow. Again, I understand the nature of the business, and I think it was due to the amount of business at the time, so I'm willing to believe nothing wrong with service. The replenishment/turnover rate of the food is fairly good, depending on what you're looking for. Of course, the more popular items will be depleted/replenished more often. The problems I have, which doesn't reflect on the restaurant at all, are the customers. Like walking the Strip, people tend to not mind where they are, or that there could be other sentient beings nearby. Not too much of a big deal, but one wonders how self-absorbed people can be in an enclosed space. The one difference between this and the Sahara/S. Rainbow location is that carbonated beverages are part of the bill, as opposed to an additional charge. Maybe it was a fluke, but will update if it was."}
{"text":"Great tasty food for a good price.  Lots of choices for the money.  And the watermelon tonight was super fresh they must have a garden on the roof or somewhere hidden.  Lots of fresh seafood choices tonight and if you like sushi they got plenty."}
{"text":"This place is about your average buffet: The food is somewhat below average. Everything tastes edible, but it might result in a stomachache later.   The sushi was, unsurprisingly, made with fake crab meat. Coffee is not offered here.   The service people here are not pleasant to interact with.  If you're only in it for the price, this is the place for you. If you want good Asian food, I suggest you try elsewhere.  It's located in a large plaza, though, so you can walk it off after."}
{"text":"i used to come to this place once a week because the price for a buffet was about $10. I came in one day around 3:30pm. And i was going to pay with my card. But this chinese lady that works there told me that there card machine didnt work. i had like 12-$13 of cash that time and she was charging me almost $20 for a DINNER Buffet! and I'm like WHAT i came in for a lunch buffet, and she was like \"the computer system already change for dinner\" \" i dont know how to change it back so i have to ring you up for a dinner buffet\" and im like are you serious? i even told her why would i even pay for a dinner buffet if i'm not even going to eat any seafood? and she looks at me like Im stupid. C'Mon now DINNER doesnt even start till like 4-5pm. What an IDIOT!  This place is a joke never go here bad customer service and foods are not even that good! i just go there before for the ox tail soup other than that food is a 3/10 in my book!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday around 12 for my daughter and niece First Communion; we made reservations for 15 people so we didn't wait to long.   Lunch was about $9 something with soda, not bad at all!   The food was okay not bad but if you go for dinner they do have crab. Since we went for lunch there was no crab but they do offer a good amount of seafood. They also have a variety of sushi which was okay not the best but at least you know they make it fresh.   The service here is not the greatest because the servers are kind of rude and it takes a while to get a refill."}
{"text":"Unreasonable price. Food quality is really BAD and has only very few kinds. You will definitely can have much better food with this price. They can survive by just bonding with tourist."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly excited to go here, at first, but my boyfriend insisted that it was tasty. I was pleasantly surprised.   Highlights:  1) Large population of Asian people eating at Buffet At Asia - always a good sign.  2) Healthy-ish options like Mongolian BBQ, Snow crab legs, fruit, salad, surprisingly good sushi, steamed prawns and more.  3) Tasty hot and sour soup (not always the case at Chinese restaurants, let alone all you can eat bbqs)  Lowlights:  1) Questionably clean dishes. They were mostly clean with a few notable aberrations.  2) Limited, gelatinous dessert selection (though I didn't see the ice cream until it was too late).  Overall, I am impressed that I liked the food, I don't feel sick after eating there, and it was only $15. I'll return."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  We were tourists driving by and saw the full parking lot as a sign that there must be something good about the restaurant.  We were not disappointed. The worn door handle and entry door let us know right off this was an area favorit.  With our Senior discount, we paid $33.28 for their Sunday Seafood Buffet...compare that to $80.+tax at the upscale M Casino and Spa's weekend dinner seafood buffet which limited choices to crablegs, raw oysters and shrimp...no lobster or calamari. Buffet Asia had every imaginable seafood piled high....freshly made and tasty. In addition there  was a huge section devoted to sushi and sashimi plus deserts, salads and fresh fruits. Service was excellent and the environment clean. From the pleasant cashier to the cost of our dinner, to the delicious array of seafoods and cleanliness of the restaurant, to the courteous waiter who efficiently removed plates so we had room for our next dish and kept our drink glasses filled, we had a wonderful dinner in this local, family dinner out restaurant.  When in Las Vegas, skip the flashy Strip with their high prices and enjoy the Sunday seafood dinner at Buffet Asia. My only complaint is the décor was blan. BUT I could have paid $45 more and had glamour but not as good a dinner or experience."}
{"text":"Was a bit more pricier than I thought but they did have seafood.. Crab legs and shrimp as well as lobster claws which was too messy to eat. The food in general was okay."}
{"text":"If you really want to know if the food is good at n Asian restaurant, all u hv to do is ask urself this...are there a lot of Asians inside ? :p seriously... if there are Asians eating there then its probably good or it at least possess so authentic Asian flavor. IF the place is filled with all caucasians..i.e. a P.F. Changs...sorry my white people no offense...nutin but love.....we, then its probably overpriced and not very authentic. It's a simple but effective test. Look for the Asians, find them, and odds are you'll find some god food.  Like the old game where's waldo.muahhhahh.  Food is not the freshest .....but You do get ur bang for ur buck. Friendly staff.  It's clean but is still a little blah to my standards...could be  better, maybe a 64.5 on a 1 to 10 michael cleanliness scale...muhaahhh."}
{"text":"This place had the worst customer service imaginable. We had the worst waiter. He was so rude that he fought with us in front of everyone.   On top of that, the restaurant was filthy. From greasy table tops to wet plates. It felt very unsanitary. Not sure how they have a passing grade. Their food was not very appetizing because it was swimming in grease. I may have gotten sick because of it.   Overall, I would never ever come back here. This was an absolute horrible experience for me and I hope you don't suffer as I did."}
{"text":"Waiting line is long and food are ok if you like regular chinese food.  I think nothing special."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. the selection was very limited. my husband thought it was good,is why I gave it 2 stars. The squid was rubbery. the egg drop soup was barely warm and had corn it. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a co-worker and it was your standard buffet fare. Decent food for the $8.29 charge. Watch out for the seats! They grab you back!"}
{"text":"I took my youngest daughter here for dinner.  For the two of us was approximately $35.00 for all you can eat.  The selection was almost overwhelming, so much to choose from.  The food was fresh looking.  What was suppose to be hot was hot and what was suppose to be cold was cold.  The sushi rolls were beautiful and tasted soooo good!  The deserts were great too if you have enough room in your tummy to eat desert.  I highly recommend this place.  I feel it's a little pricey but you get a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"I went to Buffet at Asia on at 3:30pm dinner realize that dinner starts at 4:00pm, I only paid for lunch, the waitresses come to my table at least 8 times to see if I was eating any crab legs, however never offered me a refill on my drink...Poor service."}
{"text":"A great place to stuff your face with this wide selection Asian food. Nothing that tickles my taste buds though."}
{"text":"So bad I am calling the health department! It's hot and humid in here - and the place is filthy. The floors are beyond dirty,- food stations filthy - and clear that this place is fallen below any sort of safety standard. The manager doesn't speak English and seems non responsive to pointing out areas of improvement. The staff couldn't be any worse too. Terribly disgusted and dissapointed. Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Someone please tell them to throw away food that has gone bad.  You know the food is old when it's changing color, or hard as a ROCK and your FORK bends."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Even nobody came to take our plates, we had maybe 7 or 8 plate on the table. And when we wanted to pay with credit card, the owner or manager told us no credit card accept, very rude! I will definitely not come to this restaurant any more!"}
{"text":"I afraid that the food is pretty good, but the smell in the back  dinner area is so unbearable that I became ill. I walked out with a headache and did not enjoy the experience.  I have cancel the lunch date with friend due to the unpleasant smell."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place but everytime I go I feel very sleepy. Could it be MSG? I have to admit that I like the salt and peper crab and their lobster (only during weekends).   I dread going back because of how I will feel afterwards. Food is greasy, messy serving, seating needs to be updated and overall cleanliness. The ventilation and exhaust is not great too...expect smelling like food thoughout the day (definitely not a place for a hot date)."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, I can say the food it's good but sometimes they take a long time to refill the trays. also they should have more variety on the buffet and every day it's basically the same food."}
{"text":"i went here for dinner lastnight with my family and the food was ok but the service was horrible the waitresses were rude they never smiled or asked us if we needed any refills. our waitress whos name was yuki she always had a dirty look on her and she never smiled and she looked like she never wanted to be there"}
{"text":"The 3 stars is for the food! This is one of the best of the rest of Buffet of Asia I've been to! They constantly fill the hot food area even though I went in between lunch n dinner hrs. Most of the dishes I try taste fresh! Even the salad bar was nicely set up n look after! The only two complaints I have r the staffs was a little clumsy at taken care customers. Like they took my drink order n forget about it. They clear my table n took away my drink before I even had my second plates of food. And the sushi area wasn't taken care well enough! It was a piece here n there even though this buffet has one of the best sushi offer around. But I will be back for sure n hope for the better!"}
{"text":"Buffet of Asia is one of the top ten Asian buffet in LV. If U don't want to pay astronomical prices for seafood buffets on the strip. Then this place will be your best bet for Alaskan King crab legs n oyster on a half shell craze. Dinner seafood buffet is  $15. Soft drinks cost U extra $2. But there is always the option for tap water! Like all Asian eatery. The customer service can be a hit or miss. But U will be too full to the brim to give a f*ck!"}
{"text":"Buffet of Asia is one of the few affordable buffets in LV with reasonable pricing for the weekend, $9.99 for lunch. Since it is an Asian theme buffet. Most of the food r either fried, steamed or a bit greasy. The food r serve fresh n replenish frequently. It is a nice buffet for the budget minded eaters."}
{"text":"This place has some nerve. Last Friday I went to enjoy their lobster and paid their full dinner price. There was a sign above the lobster which stated to take only three pieces. People were lined up and 1 person took almost the entire pan. They put out such a small pan of lobster, and when we complained, we were told that the lobster was an appetizer only. It takes the kitchen staff to refill the lobster 20 minutes at a time. I thought this was an \" all you can eat buffet \" but apparently not. The spareribs were hard as a rock and dry, and their chow mein was stale. I cant believe the health department gave this place an A+.  I have seen these people put old food on top of new food, and they clean their floors with a towel right on top of their patrons. The health department must be made aware of this place, as well as who is in charge of buffets in town. This place is violating all the rules!"}
{"text":"I don't know why they're always so busy, the food was horrible! They make you pay on the way in and then you're stuck! Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Coming from out of town,  I've had my share of Chinese buffets.  And this place is mediocre.  Lots of seating available.    Prices are not that bad with a good variety sushi (all sushi is either choices of crab meat or just avocado) and seafood on a weekday.  You must pay for your drinks ahead of time.   The server was very attentive to filing my drink and friendly."}
{"text":"Severs were rude and dismissive and some foods were expired (icecream) food was very salty and my husband just hurled.... all bad:("}
{"text":"4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand."}
{"text":"DO NOT eat here im from australia i had food there yesterday and me and my wife go so SICK i phoned to tell them they were so rude to us im still feeling really bad and we cant get on our flight to o to nyc today coz my WIFE still so sick do not eat or so there place is so old looking like"}
{"text":"Loved the Thai tea but the food was greasy and all tasted the same.  Didn't try sushi.  Ice cream was chrystaly. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great price for a family of four (under $50.). This was our first visit, and  I feel as if we got our monies worth. Nice selection and the food was seasoned really well. I was a lit disappointed, because there was no tempura options, but I got over it. Not a lot of good dessert options. My only complaint would be the customer service. The young lady seemed irritated that she was asked about the fountain drinks,  and I had to get up and find someone for a refill. Other than that, it's a pretty nice restaurant, and you will leave there full."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Nice small restaurant, it looks bigger than it really is.   Service: Typical from a buffet. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either.  Food: So they have the Sirloin Steak and Lamb Chops that you can order. We waited for 30 mins to finally get them, and they were super thin, and super overcooked, nothing like the pictures. lol, they never are.  The buffet itself is pretty decent.  A good variety.  Loved the crab legs.  Loved the shrimp.  Loved the barbecued fish. An okay mongolian barbecue grill, but you're not allowed to put in the sauce yourself, they mix it for you.    Bottom Line: Buffet food is pretty good.  Don't recommend the side Sirloin Steak or the Lamb Chop.  Wished they allowed you to mix your own sauce.  Other than that not a bad deal."}
{"text":"This place's got everything. As a Chinese person, the flavors are great. For the price, it has great variety and lots of seafood. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came with a tourist group and it was highly recommended by our guide. They charged $12 per person for a weekday lunch, which l later realized was way higher than the regular price they charge walk ins. While most people in my tourist group don't speak English and were foreign tourists, I am not and I for sure didn't want to be treated like an idiot who just paid his bill without asking. No price posted anywhere and front desk even lied to me that $12 is the regular price they charge other customers. I figured out myself later that they included generous tips in this $12 price. As a matter of fact, I did not get any service during my stay and I had to get my own drinks, so why I had to pay tips for missing service? In addition, what made this price fishy is the guy who collected payment at the front desk told me that I have to pay cash or I have to pay additional for tips? Why??? Is it due to the fact that you are trying to report business loss to IRS and \"smartly\" avoid paying tax on this? If there is a way, I would write a letter to IRS and report their suspicious conduct. Needless to say, the food looked and tasted like trash, unwashed and deep fried in dirty oil or mixed with all kinds of MSG. If you are looking for a value meal, don't come here! If you are looking for high quality food, don't come here! If you care about service, don't come here (seemed to me that the front desk did not know English at all). For all means, avoid this buffet at all possibilities, if you don't want to be ripped off and get diarrhea after."}
{"text":"Was in a really good mood for a quick bite of shrimp,crab legs and sushi so I thought of this buffet... Checked the dinner hours online and it says it closes at 10pm... Arrived at 8:30pm, noticed that most of the food line were empty! So I asked one of the servers of what time does it close? He said 9pm. I told him that online says it closes at 10pm! He replied that at the Saraha and Rainbow branch is the one that closes at 10pm...my husband and I have no choice but to grab whatever we want. We ate dinner like we are going to be late for work. Not a good dining experience. Food is good but need to fix the info online."}
{"text":"I called before hand to see if they had oxtail soup.  The person who answered said yes.  So I took my family and spent $100 of my hard earned money to a place where the people seem to hate their job.  No oxtail soup, regardless of my numerous request.  Bitch cashier look so sleepy she forgot to return my  debit card to me.  Food wasn't even fresh. Our tables wasn't being cleared, I even had to put some of the dishes away into the dirty cart. Was a joke of a buffet.  If i wasn't starving...i would of left.  Thank God we didn't get any stomach ache or food poisoning.  Out of all Asia Buffets the on on Sahara and Rainbow is the best.  Im never returning to this sorry location again!!"}
{"text":"I have not gone to the restaurant but had a bad experience with them.. We were on tour through Chinese tour bus.. They stopped here for lunch.. We went to target to have pizza at cafe for brunch.. I happened to get my kid diaper changed .. When I asked to permit me to the bathroom .. They started saying NO NO NO NO.. They told that I can't use the bathroom until I become a customer .. It's really awkward .. In US I hav seen all people to be courteous and generous.. But these ppl are more of a business minded.. Hate the management.. They didn't say a word of SORRY OR PLEASE.. I think there is some ethics to even reply"}
{"text":"What a dump!  It started with the chaos at the door...then the seating didn't go well...and the food...YIKES!  Everything was greasy and over cooked.  The frog legs looked and tasted like road kill.  When they say they have over 150 choices...they must be counting by the piece.  Everything in there was dirty...even the front doors.  The table was sticky, the floor was a mess.  If we hadn't already paid at the door, we would have made a quick exit and gone to a real restaurant!  But, we know how hard it is to get a credit back on your debit card.  So, we were brave little toasters and tried some of the crap they call food.    Needless to say, we will not be making a return visit to this awful place and we suggest that you avoid it also!  YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 1 star because the cookies, which probably come from a package, were tasty.   Overpriced, really greasy food and rude and rushed service.  I will never ever go back. Waste of money! And at the end of our meal, a geeky Asian girl pretty much told us they were closed and we had to leave! Ummm, it was way before closing time and there were tons of people still eating. She was so worried about sitting on the next booth to text that she shooed us out of the booth next to where she was. Fix your English before you go pushing people out of your crappy restaurant. People like this should NEVER be any part of the service industry!!  Stay away!!! Total waste of money."}
{"text":"Stay away from this buffet!  We came here with the tour bus...my father eat an broccoli and he found out the vegetable had an huge mosquito... I informed the cashier and she said she would ask the kitchen..Finally, she went back to the cashier without any explanations...bad services.."}
{"text":"For a cheaper price, they have a larger selection than many other asian buffet places but the quality in some of their food isn't there.  I found hair in the food.  On the plus side, they have good char sui."}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the crab legs but they never replaced the crab legs the whole time we were there. The bin that was out was never touched by any patrons because they were over cooked, brown and just plain disgusting looking. The staff claimed to not know how to speak English when we and several other patrons asked for some new crab legs to be placed out. Then when we spoke to the manager and he flat out refused to replace the crab that had clearly been out for at least two and a half hours. Server had a sour look on her face as soon as we sat down like she didn't want us there. Bathrooms are disgusting and never clean!!! Sushi sits out for hours and Mongolian cook station never had anyone there to cook your food. This place used to be so good. It's really gone down hill."}
{"text":"There were different types of sushi but none of them seemed fresh at all. Honestly, I'd trust Walmart sushi over this. Not a lot of selection either. Didn't see any of the crab legs or nigiri that they advertised. Not that I expected any after reading these reviews.   They also used plastic plates and forks/spoons. Just try harder guys."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying buffet Asia and I must say how horrendous this establishment was. The food was disgusting and my first bite of fried rice had egg shells. I paid $109.00 for 4 adults and two kids and literally got no refills on our sodas. If you want a buffet experience, don't waste your time and hard earned money on this place. They have dirty dish trays/bins surrounding you and everything looked dirty. Please stay away! Hope I don't get sick from eating their food. Never going there again."}
{"text":"my friend and I usually go there. food taste good , and favorfulllll!!!! not salty like other places I've been to..that  is a good point!  .... ,but the quality of food is weird... sometimes is fresh, and other times is under 2 star O.O ! uhmmm!   but I still comeback thoo! because I love their taste! ^.^"}
{"text":"Ugh.   After passing this location in Henderson numerous times we have finally decided to go there yesterday for the Lunch buffet.  Ugh again!   Plates were dirty.  One after another, after another.  Rice, sauce, etc.  At one time I put 6 dirty dishes off to the side so that no one else would take them.  The floors were absolutely filthy!  My wife and I didn't think this was worth it so we left our food on the table and left.  We made a comment to the lady at the register and she was clearly indifferent to what we said.  I have read that the other locations had good reviews so perhaps one day we may try one of those.  In an area where Chinese Buffets are few and far between it was very disappointing to come across this."}
{"text":"Pretty good place! The girl in the front was really nice, and I suppose the whole staff too. I got the buffet to go and it was nice because you could get everything you want in the container for $8.75! The food is really basic though, like how a buffet should be. Just some food to get you full, although some of the entrees were a little dry. Overall it was good!"}
{"text":"This place was ass. And all the servers had a resting bitch face! I don't think you should work somewhere where you deal with customers if you're just going to be rude to them."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location a couple of times, but yesterday was the worse. Very basic things wrong here. They had a lot of staff out on the floor and they all looked mad. We had a hard time communicating with our waitress. We were just asking for some ice. They have tables crowded in and there is a couple places where only one person can pass and the staff walks very slowly in front of customers and cutting them off. The floors were not clean. It didn't look like they had cleaned between lunch and dinner. They were out of several items as soon as they sat them out, because they allowed people to mound their plates with oyster, crabs or lobster...though there was a line of people waiting for them. I know it isn't 100% their fault, but they can manage that better. While we were sitting at our table one of the waitress came over and took our salt and pepper, never got them back. Then someone else came in...may have been a manager and proceeded to speak loudly with one of the waitresses in the middle of the restaurant while pointing at a pepper shaker on another table. The food was decent, nothing was a great standout. This isn't what I am use to with Buffet Asia. There is usually a couple things that are really good."}
{"text":"Alright so I decided one day to give this place a try and I'm very happy I did. The food and service were excellent. I arrived on a Thursday late in the afternoon and ordered the dinner. It was reasonably priced for what I got. Crab legs, shrimp and everything else you could want. The food was good but I have to say the fruit wasn't all that appealing. Edible but sort of uhmmm I suppose stale tasting.   Anyway, I didn't really go for fruit but for the other stuff. The all you can eat crab legs were accompanied by several kinds of shrimp. The fried rice was decent and the chicken and beef entrees delicious. All in all I would be happy to check out this place again."}
{"text":"Not impressive on any count, tasted ok but nothing memorable... prefer Wynn Buffet for better food.     Bellagio & Aria buffets have gone downhill quality wise,       yes, customers do know the difference when business cut corner with quality!  Why choose to go down than improving constantly??   I'll go somewhere else where quality is not too much compromised like Wynn Buffet."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Saturday evening me, me husband and my kids were very ill after eating at \"Buffet @ Asia\" I was the sickest of all because I ate Sushi. I do not want anyone else to feel like this, so stay away from this place unless you want to waste two days on a shiny toilet seat."}
{"text":"Overall Rating: - 1 star   Food: -1 star   Customer Service:  2 star Staff NOT friendly   Seating Area: 1 star  Seated at....DIRTY table & CHAIRS with discarded food on floor throughout site  Buffet Area:  - 1 star   Food Trays/ Warming Tray Containers contained other food dishes spilled over, Ice Cream/Yogurt Spillover Tray was FLITHY and contained DISCARDED cones and dark product spillover   Totally regret taking out of town visitors there."}
{"text":"Ate at the location on Eastern & Flamingo yesterday (Sunday). I eat at many asian buffets, so I know what to expect.  Here's my honest take:  Pros:  -Decent selection of food  -Server was friendly and attentive  -Gyoza dumplings, Wonton soup, Jalapeno chicken was really good, pretty decent quality fruit - seemed fresh.  Cons: -Sign claims to have \"Thai, japanese, chinese, american etc\" all different types of cuisine - the only Thai dish they had was Pad Thai, and it was of really poor quality. The sushi was kinda gross, too. They only really had chinese, and some cheap pizza for the kids.   -Restaurant in general has a \"dirty\" feel to it. I was afraid to touch anything. I ate finger foods with my fork to avoid getting sick. It was really busy, but it didn't seem like they were keeping up with the crowds very well as far as cleanliness goes.  -Bathrooms were filthy, totally trashed. I saw an employee go in to clean, but she wasn't wiping up the mess, just spraying disinfectant randomly and emptying trash.  -The grossest thing about this location were the customers - REALLY filthy people. Waiting in line to get in, a man in front of us had *KILLER* B.O. - the kind legends are made of. It smelled like he hadn't washed his ass for a month! It kinda sucked to have to experience that right before eating. The people sitting near us seemed dirty and trashy too. I know the proprietors of the restaurant can't control this, but it ruined the experience for me.  -It was really busy, and I was nearly run over by servers, kids and fat people every 5 minutes. It was difficult to walk around with a plate of food in your hands."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the value that this restaurant provides.   It was also a great venue for a family with small boys as they were able to move around.  Price was unbeatable at $12.85/adult with a large choice from the buffet:  Japanese sushi, crab legs, spicy crab, chinese dishes like spicy chicken, orange chicken, spicy string beans, a mongolian stir fry station with kalbi cooked to order, oysters on the half shell, etc   The food was pretty good on all counts-certainly wasn't Bellagio quality-but it was very tasty and an incredible value."}
{"text":"My favorite for lunch or dinner buffet. Wide variety, the bins are kept full.  Dinner has a great selection of seafood including crab.  Sushi for those that like it.  It is always packed so to eat in can create wait time. I always get mine to go. You get a box to fill and a soup container."}
{"text":"So cheap!!! Dinner for $15.99 and all the lobster you can eat! And it wasn't stingy lobster, lobster tails had real chunks of meat. All the other food was good too. They have oysters (cooked and raw), barbecue pork, sushi (although only okay; sashimi was okay, and so much more. They know how to salt. The Mongolian grill was interesting, the noodles dishes they make there aren't very good, but you should try the marinated spare ribs they have, and just have that. This is definitely a place to stop when we'll be coming back to Vegas. Forget Bellagio Buffet..."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but wasn't great don't have oysters but had some sushi crab legs and frog legs"}
{"text":"Compared with other cheap Asian Buffet places, such as China Star, this place is way above average for its food quality and quantity.  I come mainly for the basic sushi rolls and nigiri, crab legs, and the cream cheese wontons.    Surprisingly, the sushi is not bad at all for buffet style, and they have most of your basic sushi rolls.  If you are needing a sushi fix for on the cheap, this is your place.  Just be aware that the sushi is nothing fancy, just your basic, standard rolls and nigiri (California Rolls and the like).    The crab legs are another reason I frequent Buffet @ Asia, but there have been a few times lately they have been very soft and bendy on the outside, and difficult to crack open.  And everyone knows that eating crab legs can be kind of a lengthy meal in itself, so prying the bendy legs open can be kind of frustrating.  Also, I have been there once for lunch right as they opened, and their cream cheese wontons were dried out and didn't have any cream cheese filling on the inside....like they reheated leftovers and left them way too long in the oven....disappointing because I looooove cream cheese wontons.  They have your standard Asian buffet foods like Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, and Lo Mein, but they also have more unusual items like Frog Legs (which, I found out, do taste a lot like chicken....).    It is definitely worth going if you like Asian Buffet food."}
{"text":"For crab-lovers and shrimp-fanatics...this is your place.  The thing with Chinese food...it's pretty much hit or miss.  There are so many versions of Chinese food...be it Cantonese or Mandarin, or what-have-you, that there is no set way a dish is supposed to be cooked.  What I love about buffets is you can try a little bit of everything.  A little bit of this, a little bit of that.  So, if you walk in here with a mind-set of tackling down their sweet-and-sour chicken or their wonton soup...be prepared for a big disappointment, becuase you're probably going to compare it the way another restaurant does it.  I go to buffets to satisfy my seafood cravings.  I go for their weekday dinners because that's when all the good stuff comes out, without the extra charges of the weekend.    But for those who are allergic to seafood, or just choose not to eat it, I really wouldn't eat here because you're paying quite a lot just for meat.  But seafood fans...chow down!!!"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been so dissappinted by a restaurant. It baffles me this place still has their doors open. Horrible food and selection. Everything is cold and mislabeled it is over priced and they don't even have crab crackers for the crab legs. Come on.  They even have a sign saying they'll charge for any wasted food. Which is a trap because this food is all a waste. You couldn't pay me to eat this food and I cannot believe I have to pay for this meal right now."}
{"text":"I was totally craving mongolian and all i could find was this place... It was pretty good though i wish they had more options as far as mongolian grill wise... They had lots of great food, my hubby enjoyed all the seafood they had as well as the great assortment of sushi.  The waitress was very nice and helped us when we didn't know what the sushi was... that was the only thing i didnt like was there was no signs as too what the food was and i am kinda picky i want to know what i am eating. But it was still satisfying :)"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible. The place is horrible. I wouldn't even take my dog here. The floor is nastttty. The waitress was rude and when we were each ordering our drinks, she expected me to count how many cokes and how many sprites. I've never see such thing before haha.   The bathrooms were disgusting.   The food was not fresh at all. Not one of the dishes were above average. The rice was hard. The chicken was soggy. The best thing there was probably the watermelon. Funny because that's not something they made themselves. Not to mention the place is overpriced ($15 per person).   I usually don't give bad reviews but this is the worst buffet I've ever been to.   Will not come back, ever!"}
{"text":"A friend bought lunch for me here so I wasn't going to complain....I never pass up a free meal.  Typical asian buffet food experience, not too impressed.  The place is a bit janky, but I've seen worse.  Some one blew up the restroom....  I saw a BIG (emphasis on big) bald guy with his wife's purse around his neck pile up his plate with noodles for stir-fry...almost spoiled my appetite.  It's an okay hit-and-run place if you want to eat alot for lunch on the cheap, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is cheap but the service is horrible, they are rude there! I don't don't believe you leave out of that place 100% happy. Not to mention the sitting are bad, Everyone/Everything is everywhere, everything is all over the place. I have only been there for lunch, but I have had better places where I get my money's worth."}
{"text":"Lots of variety in the Asian food area not a lot of dessert options though. Plenty of fresh fruit too! Unlimited crab legs is a plus! Drink are included too so that helps. It is a little pricey if you don't eat that much, but if you have a hearty appetite that you are golden!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place . They have a very smelly & awful environment. They write there own price and tip them self . I regret eating in this place . The food is alright but the servers dont have proper etiquette, i brought my friends with me there were 11 of us they only gave us a table where only 10 people can eat . I aint eatin here never ever"}
{"text":"The place was disgustingly dirty. They sat us down next to a table that had a mountain of dishes 2 feet tall. The floor looked like they had just hosted a concert. Our table still had dirty napkins, dirty silverware, and food debris. The food wasn't anything special: very bland tasting &  greasy. It is cheaply priced though.."}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of food but be ready for lots and lots of people at this place. We went on a Sunday for lunch at it was packed! All the items were fresh and hot. So the only real complaint was the guy who elbowed me at the entrance by accident and the general feeling of being crowded by the masses. It also was the first place I've been to in Vegas where most of the people were Asian."}
{"text":"$13 weekday dinner, $16 Fri-Sat, if you live in Las Vegas/Henderson watch for local coupon mailers.  Price includes soft drinks, for dinner a piece of steak, and also a mutton chop (order these from your server). Senior discount. Thai boba tea $3 extra.  Be sure and arrive at least two hours before closing for freshest food (they will be the first to tell you this).  Bus tours stop here.  Moingolian-style grill, fresh sushi.  Soups include hot & sour  and Tom Yoong.  30 or more dinner items including steamed clams, shrimp, lobster (weekends), BBQ pork.  Another 15 or so dessert items.  Unlike casino buffets you can park right outside -- there's no Bataan death march through a smoky casino to get to the buffet."}
{"text":"Place is absolutely terrible. Wouldn't recommend to anybody. Me and my girlfriend thought we were gunna get food poisoning after leaving this place."}
{"text":"Horrible. Instead if charging kids by age, they charge by height. Kool with me. However, they dont want to charge you while you're at the front desk getting seated, the waitstaff (who barely speaks english) would seat you first, let you eat for 10mns, then ask you how many people and what are the ages of the kids. Then come this loooooong broken-english explanation of how they charge, then they ask for the height of the kids, then age again. WTF!!! Just have a damn ruler at the front and do that instead if they want to charge u by height!!! In-fact, I should get charged half price because I'm shorter than 5' !!! It took us 10 minutes to get the head count straightened out ( we had a party of 14, kids and infants included) and she would bring you the check and literally stay at the table and watched me bust out my purse to pay. This is barely 15 minutes getting seated and I literally was still chewing while she stood by after handing me the check. Rude. I could have paid first!!!  The variety of food is lacking for a buffet. i've had better. You're better off going somewhere else. However, I did come on a weekday.  Note: My 3 yr old son was charged $7 because when they asked me for age, I said 3 yrs old and I guess they thought I said 3 feet. LOL. Other places, he's usually free. I don't have the time to try to argue with them on that since they barely speak english."}
{"text":"and so we meet again.. Sushi and shashimi yammmmy."}
{"text":"Good bargain, yes. But as a family restaurant, this place could be a bit cleaner. I was embarrassed that my kid had to see the restrooms the way they were kept. There were plenty of kids around. They should take some time to remove all the grafitti in the restrooms. As far as the food, it was better than expected. As i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less. If the restrooms were kept clean i would have given them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Eat here at your own risk.  This place is horrible!  We went around 12pm, which must be the start of their lunch rush because they were very busy. But we were sat at a table immediately.  It was approximately $9/person - without drinks.  There ends the good news.  The food is tasteless and it wasn't fresh. The employees are very rude.  And it is extremely loud in there (maybe because of the tile floors). A few hours after eating there, both me and my friend were experiencing stomach discomfort.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Awful, only reason why this place is open is due to the high traffic of buses from Asia coming in! Just don't!"}
{"text":"One of the better chinese buffets. Came to try it out probably wont go back again. Food was mediocre. Service was decent."}
{"text":"The price is good for what they offer. It's not a huge buffet, but it does have some good food. I specially like the Sushi. The waiters seem way too serious, and it wouldn't hurt to smile a little. I see there's other reviews that say that there's undercooked meat, but I have personally not experienced that. Anyway, it's an okay buffet. Would I visit again? sure, but not often."}
{"text":"Got charged $13 (tax, tips included) for a lunch Buffett in this restaurant. * believe me, they cover up all price in the restaurant.*   Choices are limited consider we came with a tour bus n this is the only restaurant that open @ 9:30 (ya, i'm aware it's official hours state 11:00).  Food: I believe most foods are left over from night before, since they come out from the kitchen with 1/3 of the regular serving.  Most dishes are either too salty or too much sauces that I can't even taste the food itself. (The place I used to work does it a lot to cover up ......... ya...)  Clams are not clean probably as there's still sand in it.   Service: unless u carry a bill in ur hand ready to tip, otherwise, expect to do it yourself. * after all, it's only buffet... what's there to serve other than greeting & taking away the plates*   Conclusion:  Even with the $2 off, I would still choose macdonald & in-n-out over this. Not only because of the food quality but also the service.    Really surprise this place existing to such long time without anyone reporting it.  Recommend this place to ppl that may feel more comfortable dining in a Chinese speaking environment and don't mind left over ingredients/food or anyone that has relationship pricing with no expectable.   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice during my last visit to Vegas.   Winners: Deep-fried calamari, tilapia fillet, seafood on toast, fried rice, tom yum goong, craw fish.  Subpar: Chow mein, Dessert selection, Snow crab legs were anorexic.  The place is clean including the restroom, seating was prompt even for a party of 8 at lunch hour, parking was OK.  Lunch buffet at 6.95 and Dinner buffet at 11.95.....I can't complain"}
{"text":"worse. buffet. ever. do. not. go here. food quality is bad. its too expensive. floors were dirty. worse $15 i've spent in my life."}
{"text":"This review is brought to you live from inside buffet Asia. Had forgotten about this little gem! Luckily I was able to find it due to having previously reviewed it. However, I was alarmed by all the recent negative reviews! I was concerned it may have been overtaken by ogres who know nothing about customer service! After some deliberation I decided to chance it and hope the servers don't eat the little ones that are in our group of seven.  We arrived on Monday at 1145. We were promptly seated. Having read many a reviews I was very interested to see if I spot any sour faced employees.  As I was stuffing my mouth with the delicious stir fried string beans and salt and pepper shrimp, I did manage to spot a smile-less server! However, that was more than countered by the other 4 smiling waiters and waitresses I had spotted, not to mention the smiling kitchen workers that were bringing out more fresh, delicious food.  Bottom line is, your mileage may very, I am sure. But for this San Diegan that frequents vegas no more than three times a year, at 9 bucks for adults and kids price in the 4s, with soda priced at 95 cents, buffet asia hits the spot. I am gladly tipping 20% for their prompt removal of our plates and the quick multiple refills for me who drink like a horse, and we are on our way back to mandalay bay to relax by the water.  Once again, this is H.L., reporting live from inside the best value for chinese food in las vegas. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Foods filled with salt, grease and MSG. The restaurant manager was yelling at her emplyee for 5 min while we were waiting in line to enter. The floor and restrooms were all filthy. Couldn't wait to get out of this place after eating few things.   This one star is giving to its price. It's cheap but I really don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Food was dry and servers were rude! Too many people and not enough room . Their was no selection for food and everything was out! DONT COME HERE!!!! And I found a COCKROACH by the food! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"For 10 bucks you seriously can't complain. Having said that, this buffet is well worth the money, if not more. You will come across some dishes here and there which don't seem that fresh but the variety is fantastic. If they upgrade the decor, this place would be heaving."}
{"text":"horrible service!! they don't even bother to get you a drink! won't recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Very little food to choose from. The sliver wear was dirty and plates as well. When i asked for my money back they seemed like they were use to it ,and gave me a gift certificate instead."}
{"text":"Decent enough buffet with the typical findings. Not a very large selections, or it doesn't feel like it has a large one. There's some more specialty items here like a larger sushi bar, fresh stirfry, sometimes tritip, and tempura. And there are the typical asian buffet fair.  One star off for bad service--half the time the servers flounder. And the building layout sucks. Another star off for some of their food is just lacking, or seems a bit \"watered down\".   I like to go here when I get tired of other asian buffets in the area. Try coming here as it opens as the food is fresher and sometimes there's dishes that are only laid out once. If you don't want to take the risk, try Krazy Buffet up the road."}
{"text":"If anyone says they don't like this place then they're from another planet. Here's the deal: I've lived in Vegas 7 years and for the first two I searched high and low for a good Chinese buffet and Mongolian BBQ. Then I happened upon this place. For the next five years, I visited this place LITERALLY every Saturday.  This place is incredible. The selection is HUGE and the food quality is INCREDIBLE. And... it's one of the best Mongolian BBQs I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot).  I am now moving to Colorado and it breaks my heart to leave this place behind.  Go here. You'll love it. A bit pricey for dinner (but I'm known to be a bit cheap) but for lunch you'll pay $8.50. Well worth it. Okay I'm hungry now."}
{"text":"I usually come in here for cheap take-out, where they give you a reasonably sizable box and soup container to fill up with buffet items.  You can be stingy or you can just pig out and stuff as much as you can fit without cheating into the containers.  I usually make a bee-line for the premium stuff like the sushi, which quickly recoups the take-out costs."}
{"text":"They have good sushi surprisingly - not a big variety, but it's fresh and tasty.  Great food, great price and they bus the tables up quickly!"}
{"text":"i'm a big asian buffet guy, even bad asian buffet. i live for finding the one redeeming dish while suffering through all the bad ones but i tried most everything and i couldn't find one @ this buffet. all the chicken dishes except for the wings used that slimy, rubbery, mysterious chicken you find @ bad teriyaki places. i dug the chicken wings and the shrimp but they tasted old and reheated like everything else. they hide the sushi! i dished up two plates before i saw it over there. my fault, i like to start at one end of the buffet and work my way to the other and i usually don't start @ the salad side, haw! it was typical buffet sushi, poor quality and covered in mayonnaise. i probably would have liked it more if i had started with it though. i think i'll wait 'til my bad buffet loving bros come to town to even consider hitting this place up again. the price is right though, so i'll give 'em that."}
{"text":"So once every few years I think to myself \"hey maybe I should go to a cheap Chinese buffet\" and then more often than not I regret my decision. This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"I made an act. Just so I can rate this place.  For some reason my aunt loves this place and it gets worse every time we visit this place. They have added more chairs which make it nearly impossible walking around with your plate with out the waiters bumping into you. Cleanness is far from it. Serving spoons are not clean and used for more than one dish. Floors seem to be not mopped in days. Be careful of the ceiling fan they don't clean it and dust is clearly on it.   Now the food. It's not bad. I mean it's the kind of food that you can tolerate to eat. But when you are done eating you feel disgusting. Disgusted that you at at this place.   One thing about this place that I commend is the waiters though. They are poorly understaffed and they work really hard. In fact I didn't see one of them stand around."}
{"text":"Whatever you do - don't eat the oysters  or stay away altogether.  My son and I had early dinner here last Saturday (3/19) and I had the oysters and he didn't.   That same evening, I was having non-stop diarrhea and 2 days after, violent vomiting. I'm still not well but self-medicating with Imodium and trying to take fiber and liquids when I can . I may go to Urgent Care tomorrow if this doesn't go away.  I had a sense this was a dodgy place but had a craving for seafood and this is close to my place and I didn't want to spend a lot.   Serves me right but never again.  If anybody reading this has the misfortune of having a similar experience, I hope you will go to this Southern Nevada Health District link and file a complaint: http://southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/foodborne/fbi-form.php  Let's work together to make eating out a much safer and enjoyable experience for all of us. Thanks."}
{"text":"Really...? This place is open for business?  The customer service is awful. No greeting at the front door. The \"host\" pointed to a table across the room and asked if that would work. He did this with everyone.  The woman assigned to my table was very nice, attentive, and polite. I tipped her well.  The food was bad. Soup was not hot and the won tons were very soggy. The sushi was good even though not well presented or kept up.  The noodles were also soggy and lacked any kind of Asian flavor. The fried rice was barely warm. Even the fried chicken was hard. The orange chicken was gloppy and not fresh at all.  When I left the restaurant, both people working the front were each on their cell phones and did not even bother to look up. The doors were filthy with hand prints all over them. This place is dirty and not inviting at all.   It's sad...at best."}
{"text":"I refuse to go back to this place, maybe it was just a bad day for them but my experience with this place was miserable. I did not like the smell of it, it was too hot in there, wasn't impressed with the cleanness of the entire place, food is not better than Panda Express to be honest, I really wanted to like it, but I did have a bad first impression I guess, and I also have read that it was shut down by health department before. I really am surprised that its. Still in business. I am sorry but I'm being honest and this is just my opinion and my own experience."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Asian buffet I've ever been to. Food was stale tasting, questionable texture of the meat items, the floors looked dirtier than a homeless persons box and the bathrooms might as well be an alley sewer drain. Who cares if its a buffet, it's still $9.50 for lunch. I've gotten more satisfaction from a lottery ticket that didn't match any numbers."}
{"text":"The food was okay but after finding a bug crawling in my food, I told the waitress about it. I'd killed the bug in my food, but she asked to see the bug. Bugs usually have legs and crawl around, so I know it was a bug...like a fruit fly. I dug around in my plate, looking for the bug so she could see it. She said that its usually mussel hairs, and not a bug. I asked for the manager, but she said that she would need to see the bug first. About five minutes later, a bug crawled upon my table. I smushed it with the receipt, and then called the manager to me again. She looked at the bug, and said that it wasn't big enough to be a bug, and walked away. Apparently, you need to have roaches on the table in order to have sympathy from this place. With their careless attitude, I wouldn't be surprised if people ate food that was less than fresh. They make you pay before eating there, so as to have you money in their hand before you complain. I would stay away from this place, as it is not clean, and the manager could care less if there are bugs at your table or in your food. Even after complaining to her twice, she didn't care. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"It was ok. The buffet wasn't very diverse or big. But it was good and heated. Hibachi was good and sushi I didn't dare try the raw but the cooked sushi was good. The place was good not great not bad. Very mediocre."}
{"text":"We eat at Buffet @ Asia a few times a year. If you have picky kids to feed it always works. They can find anything from asparagus to spring rolls. Pizza and noodles are always a basic with kids.   As for Adults the lunch is average the cost about $9 each. Come in the evening that price pops up about $10. The added price offers you the selection of crab legs, frog legs and other non-lunch menu items. Many guests do not realize you receive one free alcohol drink with your meal if you ask. It's never been offered to me but if you ask you can get beer or wine.   Depending on the day you will find very great service and energetic servers or possibly wait 20 minutes to get a drink refill. It's hit and miss but usually satisfactory. The dishes on the line are continuously refilled and the food hot.   It's a nice lunch spot where two can dine for under $20."}
{"text":"Oh Boy Are we eating here? That's what I thought at the door.  0 Stars for outdated grimy look and feel of the entrance, back seating area, and restroom. They have hand written notes everywhere. One says \"No refunds\" I wonder why.  0 Stars for service. They don't say hello. They don't say \"you're welcome\" when you say \"Thanks\". Staff looked at me crazy when I asked one to Re-Wipe down my table.  0 Stars for food even tho with the selection it should have been better. I sampled lots but only like one chicken dish and the fried shrimp. Not even the noodles were good. They were greasy.  1 Star for location. It is right near my new favorite scrapbook store, ScrapbooksRUs.   1 Star for price. $32 for 3 people.  Read Michelle M. review of this place too. It spot on."}
{"text":"Tried many Chinese buffets in town and this one is the best of the dozen or so in Vegas. They do have pretty fresh ingredients. They do switch some of their lunch dishes out during dinner so you don't feel like your paying more for only lunch items. For dinner you get more of the seafood dishes like, shrimps, mussels, lobsters, crabs and fish.  Overall taste of all the dishes is consistent. We've been dining at this buffet from time and time again for the past two years and haven't been disappointed. They do have a good selection of dishes, with a decent sushi, fresh fruits, dessert and a Mongolian BBQ station. It's more of a locals buffet so don't expect it to be like a fancy buffet at one of the strip's hotel. The food is good and the price is reasonable, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"The food was fresh & hot and turn over great since there are so many people coming and going. A lot of dishes to choose from! Sushi delicious. Give it a try if you like Asian food."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. The food is fine, yet the staff are appearing very hostile and impatient toward the client."}
{"text":"If I can give this a zero star I will. Havent had chance to post my review yet since im too busy. But now I wanna say that its the worst buffet at asia I ever been too. My sister got food poisoned eating here like 2 months ago!  Had to take her to the ER and doctor said its a food poisoned , asked her what she ate and I remember the only thing we ate is at the buffet asia. I think its the bbq shortribs (cook to order) that she ate to made her felt like that. Its probably undercooked or bad already. Goodthing I didnt eat that or else will both be on ER. I would never go here again!"}
{"text":"this has always been our go to for Chinese food at a buffet  living in Vegas my whole life we have had a lot of Chinese food places come and but this place never fails to be fresh.  if you are into sushi they have an entire sushi bar and its very fresh and kept up to date they even have little stickers of when they were put out on the buffet so you can ensure that  it is not too old  they have an amazing selection of Mongolian barbeque and it's like a pic your own Chinese food and they cook it fresh for you it is to die for  this place is pretty big and seats a lot of people has a lot of traffic so very rarely do I see a wait but it is always packed and because it is always packed the food turnover is incredibly quick  very rarely have I seen dishes cold,  empty or close to empty usually its full fresh heaping piles of goodness that you can scoop on to your plate  they have fresh crawfish hot and cold they have a good soup selection and a great Chinese selection all the way from fried rice to want on soup too fried wontons to pot stickers to muscles to hot wings to pizza for the kids  it is definitely worth the price you will not regret going   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. As soon as we walked in, the cashier was not friendly at all and rushed us so much that she even over charged me! By the time I noticed it was too late. The restrooms are disgusting, you could tell they hadn't  been cleaned in a while or even on a regular basis. The waitress only came by to give us our drinks and then once again to let is know they were going to be closing. She never offered refills or to pick up our stacked plates and basically kicked us out. The food was an average C. Not only is this place overpriced for how crappy they are but they still managed to rip me off even more by double charging a tip on my bill on a party of 3 when they state they only charge tip on parties of 8 or more. Avoid all of this and go spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place price was so affordable and food was so fresh waiter also was so friendly plus drink was included price for sure if I come back to vages I wanna go that place again i for sure recommend everyone that place"}
{"text":"Cold and gross is the best way to describe the food. This has to be one of the worst dining experiences I have had in my life in the last 30 years. Even worse was it cost of this horrible meal. Read the reviews that's where we made our mistake. We forgot to read them before we went in the restaurant but now looking at them afterward we are in a hundred percent agreement with all of the one star reviews. This place was the absolute pits. Best way to describe the whole experience is cold gross food full of grease salt and MSG. Go to McDonald's you'll have a much better experience and a much better price."}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet once a few years ago when I first moved to Vegas. I wasnt that impressed with their food. Considering its not hard to like Asian food. I havent been back since then. Today, my wife and I were so hungry, wanted something quick and didnt have to wait for the food. I wanted to give this place another shot considering theyre still in business. They must have gotten better. WRONG! Not only was their food disappointing, it was worse than I remember & the \"other\" room in the back right corner had this awful musty smell. It was like a combination of a porta potty & a senior home living. The whole experience was just horrible. I barely ate. Couldnt stand being in the place that long. If you have any thoughts of going here, dont even bother. There are better local buffets that will cost you the same but way better."}
{"text":"Well to begin this review, I only paid $3 to eat at the buffet due to careless staff. The food itself is not very good, most of it just being fried or completely flavorless, however the soft serve ice cream is extremely delicious I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"My first experience there and it was great all the varieties of different Sea food waitress was courteous"}
{"text":"I wonder what buffet Asia did to not show my review on here.. guess I was too honest about my experience and the quality, and how the food tastes. lol"}
{"text":"Negative stars for this place!!! This use to be one of mine and best friend's spot to eat. On one of our regular trips (we love the crab legs...) needless to say, the eyeball on my crab was still there looking at me and my friend found what looked to be a nose hair in her won ton soup.   We both left in a hurry and made sure no one saw us because we still had full plates of food and were afraid to be charged extra. We proceeded to throw up in front of the restaurant.   NEVER AGAIN. We are very sadden by the fact that one of our favorite spots is RUINED for us."}
{"text":"The sushi bar is odd. There was sushi that was multicolored and flies were ON the food. There isn't a lot of food to choose from. There is no AC and it is extremely crowded. I probably wouldn't recommend this place... :/"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, liked the variety.  Place has some unusual odors and not too clean.  Workers not too friendly. Separate charge for drinks.  Thought it was strange for a buffet."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.  You can find better places than this.  Very unsanitary place and lots of bugs and dirty dishes.  The food was overflowing and lots of cross contamination.  If you decide to eat here don't eat the sushi or the chicken"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I took my parents and two boys to eat here. I was so upset that I spent a lot of money and none of is left satisfied. The restaurant itself was dirty. My two year old son wouldn't even eat the pizza or cookies so that told me something. What was suppose to be a nice family dinner turned out to be a disaster. Do yourself a favor and don't go eat here. I see why they have a sign up front saying no refunds!"}
{"text":"There are several Buffet@Asia in town, but this one is definitely the best. Lunch (less than $8, drink included) is your above average Chinese fare, but they change up the menu, so you will see different dishes on a regular basis. I awarded the 4 stars because of their dinner buffet. Last time I ate here (Sat night), I was determined to load up on sushi, but they offered so many different seafood dishes that I had to pass. For sure quality food at a very affordable price. Find a solution for your dirty trays of dishes and maintain your crowded bathroom better and I will award the 5th star!"}
{"text":"Bad services and bad food .The waitress was yell at me because i want my receive back."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky diner typically, but this place is a huge disappointment.   The food gave both my boyfriend and I a really bad stomach ache.    The decor is old and doesn't look sanitary.   Their isn't a huge selection of food and I found the items I picked to be under seasoned and very oily.   The service was good, fast and it's very cheap to eat for an AYCE, but based on taste and ambiance I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone"}
{"text":"I'm giving this chain a one star because in both locations they have the worst customer service ever! It's like the staff is not trained to be more empathetic or hospitable! I'm currently at the one on Nelis but for some reason it does not show up on yelp, but there is a guest with her family for lunch time on the 10th of January and she begins to Star having a heart attack although the guest asked the worker to called 911 and she was not even responding she would just stare at the guest! What the hell!? These workers need to open their eyes and show more concern instead all they got was the workers staring and passing right by them while the guest were showing more concern for her than the actual employees! This is ridiculous! Finally ambulance got here but sure no thanks to the workers! The food is good but this is really uncalled for and unprofessional!"}
{"text":"I want to use a credit card payment, but they want to charge me $1 service charge.The lunch person is $8.49 see on the poster .but they $13 to charge me ? I don't know why? Poor service attitude??"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we ate there.  Some of the food was ok but when I saw a roach cross the floor and go under our table, I totally freaked out and never went back.   That might have been a one-time thing but I just can't bring myself to return."}
{"text":"I domt know why this place gets such low reviews. Food is great. Service is great. Inexpensive.  They have great sushi and Mongolian bbq. One of my favs im Vegas."}
{"text":"Lunch sucked. Not worth the price or the time. It smelled like sewer. Bathrooms dirty. Now I wanna go throw up my lunch I ate there. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly, food is on point.. If your hungry, you've come to right place... Every visit i make to this location with my family, it is exceptional.. We are never disappointed always leaving stuffed and satisfied.. Don't pay too much attention to all the reviews, you'll have to check it out for yourself.. You be the judge based on your own reviews, not someone else.. Happy Eating Yelpers"}
{"text":"restaurant owner has some serious racial discrimination problems. for you all that does not care about discrimination, go ahead continue dining there.  p.s. food quality is.questionable. too bad there is not an one star option, or i would be glad to choose that."}
{"text":"If you enjoy hot and sour sauce on your shoes, dirty filthy bathrooms, rude staff, burned food you will absolutely love this place. The owners have no pride of ownership and should be ashamed of themselves.  I recommend the fried rice with a side order of hand sanitizer."}
{"text":"Not many choices, Feast buffed at Red Rock Casino is much better"}
{"text":"Brought my family here yesterday.  The food is good but the service is terrible.  Please do not come here and expect good service."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian buffet for the dinner price of $13.95 you can't beat it. The food is always fresh and they serve huge meaty king crab legs and fried crabs too. The fried chicken wings tastes like you made them at home. There's a variety of vegetables and rice dishes the sweet plaintains are to die for. Dinner starts at 4 pm til 9 pm. There are fresh oysters and clams and sushi too. Non alcoholic drinks including Chi Tea are unlimited. Instead of ice cream you'll get more of a frozen dessert not milk based and a variety of fruits, jello, cakes and cookies and sesame seeded nuts. There's also a huge wok where you can pick your ingredients and they will cook it for you.  The staff is very friendly and they will pass by your table often to remove the plates.  Because I love seafood I go here often. It's very family friendly and usually the wait time is about three minutes. If you are arriving with a large party call ahead to reserve some tables. The decor is relaxed and comfortable booths or you can dine at the table with chairs if you choose. I prefer a booth because it gives us extra room for all of the yummy dishes we get. Asian ribs there are tasty just a bit too over cooked for me. In the back of the bufet they do offer peel and eat shrimp which sometimes can be on the pasty side. They also have delcious pepper shrimp which I love.  Pizza never has sauce it's mainly bread and cheese so I don't bother with it at all. I am not a frog leg eater. My family has said they are fried a bit hard for them. There's also baked Tilapia and Swai fish too which is delicious. The lunch isn't as great as the dinner because even though they have a good selection of the basic foods there's no seafood during lunch except fish. Because of the high turn over of guest the food is always fresh and hot. TRY IT YOU WILL BE BACKkkkkk !!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out this Buffet at Asia in Henderson, NV when we first visited to Nevada . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE. Upon entering this place not much of the staff spoke english, but they know how to count your money perfectly. There isn't much to write about the decor it's more like junior high cafeteria style wooden tables and small hard uncomfortable wooden chairs. There's a mediocre sushi bar near the front entrance.  The asian style ribs were so over cooked we couldn't eat them. We asked the waitress not to bring our drinks until we had gotten our food. I think the walls pay more attention to what you say then these people. Upon our return to the table there sat our drinks. Of course I requested she make all fresh drinks and watched her pour fresh drinks as well. I am very skeptical about unattended drinks and foods myself. Of course she wasn't very happy with my request and watching her back either. If you love seafood as I do such as fresh unlimited king crabs legs, fried blue claw crabs and fish etc. Now as of 2013 to present. Go to the Buffet @ Asia on Flamingo and Eastern Ave, Las Vegas. My nail technician recommended that place and we love it.   The service is very friendly and the foods are always fresh and hot. There's a very high turn over during dinner hours from 4 pm to 9 pm. The lunch doesn't offer the same menu as the dinner does no king crab legs, fried frog legs, fried crab or pepper shrimp. The price for dinner is $13.95 you leave a tip after you dine. Alcohol drinks are extra but there's unlimited teas and water and Chi tea too. The dessert doesn't offer real ice cream it's just a frozen like iced milk. But they do have a selection of asian desserts cakes and cookies etc. The ribs are tasty but over cooked and dry. The veggies and rice are very good. King crab legs are a good size and plenty of them. But you must watch when they put them out because people grab them two plates full at a time. The atomosphere is relaxed and family friendly. They also have a huge wok station where you can choose your own ingredients too.  By far this is the best one of many of the Bufet @ asia to eat in Vegas. Be sure to dine no later than 8:30 pm because they will begin to clean the buffet to close for the night."}
{"text":"Lots of crab and shrimp for a cheap price. Amazing variety of food. That sums it up for me."}
{"text":"I went here last week with some friends. I thought most of the food was average. Paying first seemed a little odd. Sushi selection is good. They have chicken nuggets and pepperoni pizza for people who gets dragged there by friends who wants Asian buffet food. I heard from locals that they've gotten cheaper (than when they first opened). Not sure if it's because of more competition coming to Vegas or if they just aren't that good."}
{"text":"Both the fried chicken and chicken skewers were undercooked aka raw. Not uncommon for this place. I have yet to come here and have a good meal, there is a location close to here that does much better, but still have their faults, but not salmonella faults."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Rainbow/Sahara location several times, and although it's not the greatest food, I've considered it OK for the price (lunch was recently $6.99, 7 days a week there, but now up to $7.29). This location, at Flamingo and Eastern was $8.29 for Saturday lunch. We actually wanted to go to Thai Spice (4 stars), but it was closed for remodeling. We then though we'd go to FUJI (4 stars) down at Tropicana & Pecos, one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Vegas, but apparently they changed their weekend hours, so we finally ended up here instead.  First off, I got a sense of overall \"ickiness\" the minute we walked in. There's just a humid, sticky sort of feeling inside, and when we were seated, the booth had loose seat-back and the table was dirty and sticky. The first thing I got was a bowl of Won-ton soup, which I had to load with salt & pepper, because it had no sense of flavor whatsoever. My kids said the same thing about the egg drop soup. The Pad Thai noodles were flavorless as well. Everything I ate had the same sort of greasy, flavorless, coating to it. Seeing Pizza, French Fries, and Fish Sticks is just a joke - shame on the spineless parents who can't get their kid to experience something other than fast food/junk food.  I also noticed meat just pulled from the freezer being used at the Mongolian station, in thick, frozen blocks, not even thawed. Not safe - won't be cooked through all the way. Also, up above the kitchen, up on a shelf with some decorations, I spotted a food prep bucket...catching a leak maybe?  Anyway, I'll never go back to this place, and probably will not frequent the other location as often either. I'd rather pay $8/$9 for a smaller portion of enjoyable food, than this all-you-can-eat slop."}
{"text":"Lucky those who live here! This place has really good food. Good service, affordable and I wish we had a place like that in AZ."}
{"text":"After writing my last review I realized that I had never reviewed Asia Buffet.  I have always gotten good service at this location- they have great food for a reasonable price. I find that I love their sushi especially the california roll and ebi.  They also serve good marinated steak.   Yep I will go back!"}
{"text":"I really do not recommend this place. It is expensive, the food has no real taste to it, employees are not friendly. The owners have forgotten maybe that happy employees, happy customers. The two women at the register are rude and sarcastic. Save yr money"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for years and have typically had nothing but good things to say. However, not this time. The food items are now of lower quality and the price has gone up. After eating I went to the men's room and it was disgusting! When I was leaving the men's room one of the cooks was exiting a stall and didn't even wash his hands before putting on his green apron and going back to work. Yuk. I told the receptionist /cashier about both issues and she really didn't seem to care at all. They also previously had Mongolian grill BBQ (sign outside still advertises that), but once you pay first and get in; you discover that they no longer offer it. Sort of bait and switch! I will never go back to this location again. I didn't have time to check their health department rating because I was feeling sick. WATCH OUT !!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, place wasn't busy when we arrived.  We came here mostly for their crab legs and sushi and I have no complaints on that, sushi were fresh and the crab legs were continuously brought out and other food as well. Overall the food were great and our waitress was very nice, I didn't see any stacked plates on our table, she was always walking by removing plates from her area, she was very attentive."}
{"text":"The worst Asian buffet that I been to. To start off, I knew this would be a bad experience the moment I stepped in the door and pay. We came with a big group (17 people) and decided to split into 3 separate groups to avoid the automatic 12% gratuity fee. However, when I tried to pay with my credit card and it got decline, the lady was already giving me attitude. Tossed my card back and gave me an ugly frown. Also, they have senior discount, but it hardly counts for anything because its only $1 off for a senior discount!   Anyways, we got seated, took our drink orders, and went to get food. My brother and aunt were both vegetarian and soon found out that the place hardly had any veggie food so they decided to asked for a refund. Again, the lady at the cashier gave us a hard time again. She finally gave the refund for my brother and aunt after a bit of argument but charged us $5 for the two drinks that they never even touched. At that point we were really pissed, but hungry so decided to stay. My brother and aunt left to eat somewhere else.   The food was TERRIBLE. Only 4 soup available, no hot and sour soup or crab soup (thats funny because almost all Asian buffet would have one of these), Tom Yum soup was very bland and tasted like water. They had mongolian BBQ so I decided to try that out. Waited almost 20 minute to get the food and was very unhappy. My noodle and meat were overcooked and burnt. My corn and veggie were undercooked and still raw. Their ice-cream was also terrible, watered out and disgusting.   Service was horrible. The entire time I was there, I noticed none of the workers ever smiled. The waiters/waitress came by to pick up our dirty plates but never once did they asked us for a refill even though they clearly saw our empty soda cups.  If you want good Asian food, go somewhere else. This buffet is meant to serve mostly Non-Asian people (I saw mostly Hispanics) who doesn't really understand what real Asian food taste like (No offense to them).    In short, food and service was extremely terrible."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap eats with a good selection.  The panhandlers in the parking lot can be a bit aggressive."}
{"text":"Typical  of any asian buffet that i've been to before. My friends and i got hungry for some adventure that didn't cost $40 so we came to check this place out.   They offer crab and lobster. they were both okay. not too fresh. free thai tea. lots of asian food typical at buffets. aside from the crab and the lobster i thought it was pretty yummy.  they offer a lot of seafood.  took them a while to clear our plates from our table. im not sure if they were just ignoring us because sometimes they would just walk by and not take the plates.   but, for $15 this place is a steal."}
{"text":"We always come to this location  and we are regular customer but it seem like every single time it getting worse and worse they getting more nasty and always have an attitude it seem like they're not a volume their regular customer I don't know how they in the business when the service is horrible especially when they have a big Group sometime I ask them for the table that fit all of us and right on that moment they give us an attitude right the way it seem like they the only want to do their way only I will never come back to this place"}
{"text":"I do like the food there but was very busy at the time. At least that meant that the food was changed out quickly. Not too keen on the service but what do you expect from a buffet. Food was decent not excellent but then again....cheap buffet.  All in all it is good for the price. Will go again."}
{"text":"Really excellent food for its price.....Recommend if you are not caring too much on the environment."}
{"text":"The food itself is about par for chinese buffets (average at best). I had no choice but to eat at this place when on a tour bus from Las Vegas.   What brings it down to 1 star is the incredibly rude service even for Chinese restaurants (and I'm chinese). Worst service I've ever encountered in my life. Someone in my party ordered soda for everyone. I wanted only water and asked a nearby waitress for an extra cup of water. She gave me the stank eye right away and demanded in a very rude tone \"Where's your ticket?\" I was like \"Wtf are you talking about? I need a ticket for water?\" Then she said with a really mean face \"I already got you your drinks, 1 more is going to cost you extra.\" After some back and forth she finally got the message that all I wanted was a cup of water and not another soda. Seriously? I had to get into a near fight with a waitress and make the rest of my party uncomfortable over a cup of ####ing water? I'm surprised she didn't slam the cup of water on my table. She probably spit in it or something.   I was so pi##ed over the whole thing that I wrote a note of complaint and dropped it in their tip box. I was literally fuming the rest of the day and this review is pretty much the first thing I did after getting back from my Vegas trip. They deserve this bad review wholeheartedly.  The problem is that owners are so cheap that they write the number of your party on a tiny #ss little fortune cookie slip of paper. You're supposed to put that slip on your table and waitresses use it to give you the right amount of drinks. This little piece of paper can fly away easily or slip underneath the table. Waitresses literally demand for that slip of paper before giving you drinks. I'd give it 0 stars if yelp let me because of the cheap owners and waitresses with serious attitude problems. Suck it, Buffet at Asia."}
{"text":"This buffet has all the kinds of food you'd expect from a basic Asian buffet. It was good, satisfies you from dear hunger, although it wasn't as delicious as you would think it would be. The egg drop wonton soup was pretty bland. There wasn't a variety of deserts that I personally thought were good. The sushi was alright, I wasn't overly thrilled at the taste. Overall, it was an ohkay experience. However the staff were pretty friendly, our waitress that handled our drinks kept checking up on us and offered frequently to refill our drinks and clear our table from the used dishes. I would come back here, but won't be expecting much from it in the future."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The workers are rude as hell, food was mediocre as you'd expect at any buffet, I've never been to a buffet where I pay first I wish we had spent our money elsewhere but we went here as it was close to the church we had attended and wanted something quick. Lesson learned, will not go here again, nope, and I don't recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Would be a 5 star but because they don't know the difference between spring rolls and egg rolls it's a 4. Spring rolls suck."}
{"text":"Food is nasty! I didn't like anything from this place. Service is lacking, no refills. Young Chinese waiter was extremely rude. He waved his hand to tell me to move instead of saying the simple phrase \"excuse me\". Also, I caught him pouring customer's leftover soy sauce in a jug then pour them back in the soy sauce container. very unsanitary! My mom had diarrhea after eating at this place. Avoid this place at all cost!!!!,"}
{"text":"Years ago I loved this place. Now they do and say unexpected things. If you come a half hour before dinner they come like drill seargents asking you to pay for dinner.  Today didn't  want me to sit where I wanted to. Wasn't busy  The food left little to be desired. I've sadly seen the quality drop throughout  the years. Now just can't get worst.  They need some good competition now. Their low quality lunch now shows in lack of customers. If you lower the quality of the food people are just going to waste it. which by the way, yes theres a sign which says wasting food will leed to an additional charge..Yep they thought of just about everything.  Anyone have a asprin?"}
{"text":"As I've gone to buffet of asia through out the years Ive seen the quality of the food sink to the lowest low. The food is either dried out or  bad. I was there a long time & they never changed  the beef and brocolli, &  what was there should have been disposed of when I first got there. My mother asked for napkins. The waitress ignored her. The ice cream machine was filthy. They had no soup bowls for the soup. They had signs threatening to charge for food left on your plate. Waitresses only approach you to ask you to pay more money if sitting there & lunch tur0H lns to dinner.  They need to be kidding to expect a tip. Maybe hire a waitress thats happy to seen you there. They have no competition. Don't understand how they pass health inspections."}
{"text":"I hate uppity, fancy-pants, stuck up hipster yuppie duechey restaurants. In fact I absolutely despise them. All I care about is good food and service devoid of snobbery. Buffet @ Asia delivers on both counts. The floor staff was attentive and efficient, and friendly (and I am as white as whitey can be, so anyone who assumes that they will receive bad service from the 100% Asian staff does so in ignorance).  Sure the place seems a tad run down at first glance, but this is not the case with the food. The selection is enormous, and omg it made me so happy! Everything I tried was absolutely delicious, with only one exception. Just skip the ribs. If you see ribs and think \"Mmmmm.... Ribs.\" Just keep walking. They almost made me choke, and then almost made me puke. This place, although in kind of a weird part of town, is an excellent choice if you love Asian food. It is NOT fancy! But it is awesome :) P.S. The best part is that you wont be hungry 10 minutes later, mostly because you will still be stuffing it in your face! ;) Thank you. - Ken"}
{"text":"Very very rude staff!! Food was not fresh in the slightest. Its cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. I dont recommend them."}
{"text":"Just went there with my girlfriend.  We went to the one on Rainbow Rd, we were originally going to visit the Pacific buffet, but we always see this place crowded so we figured why not.  I don't usuaully eat at buffets unless I know they are good, well this place blows Pacific out the door.  Their varieties were huge and the quality was excellent for the money.  Large variety of sushio, along with a well kept mongolian bbq, and I must recomen the steamed clams.  Between the clams, oysters, crab legs and craw fish, I honestly have no idea how this place makes money when considering the good quality along with the reasonable price.  This place has excellent service and unlike other buffets they actually make sure plenty of food is out at all times.  I was extremely impressed with this place, and the bar prices seem to be very reasonable.  As far as buffets go, this wins it hands down and then some.  There is no reason to try any other after this place, you will just be disappointed.  I highly recomend!"}
{"text":"I dont understand why some of the reviewed are so low..I live in the neighbourhood for five years. This Asia buffet is our favorite still..And now it looks like under  new management and better than before..I give it 4 stars..And they're trying very hard to satisfy the customers."}
{"text":"Horrible experieces when having lunch in this restaurant! Wish i could give a negative star! Terrible customer service and show no respect to customers! DON'T TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Staff was very rude, rushing us, not friendly at all. Tried charging me again for another coffee. Was staring at us to see if we finished all the food, which we did. I would not recommend this place! We are very good at tipping but for this service we will tip 1 cent, to show our disappointment in their efforts."}
{"text":"Had lunch there at different sites couple of times. Food ok. Had same type at different places and better selection but this place ok. Different sites have different ambiance but mostly ok."}
{"text":"Today I had the worst time and meal at buffet@ asia .The crabs the worst no meat bad flavor and it's a lot better at Lee's Buffet on FlamingoThe service at Buffet@Asia was terrible too my family and I could not get a drink or napkins  ."}
{"text":"Wanted a change from all the Hotel restaurants. The place had your normal Asian buffet foods. And $20 for 2 I would go back again."}
{"text":"For the price, the food is decent. I was a bit skeptical about the sushi, but I had a couple of the rolls anyway, and they were good. While it's not the most aesthetically pleasing place, it serves its purpose, and the Chinese food is okay."}
{"text":"The most awful experience it was at this so called buffet where we ended up eating nothin but stale food for dinner that was all cooked for lunch. The ambience was totally disgusting and disordered. The waiters neither respond properly nor recognize the food being served. All together I would advice not to shell out even a penny for this food."}
{"text":"Cheap cheap cheap!!! Less than $10/person for lunch. They have sushi and it's quite good so instead of KAYA or Sushimom which is like $20/person, this is much cheaper and still delicious. Chinese food is top. Tons of seafood and yummy deserts. Nothing bad to say. Satisfy numerous cravings at once!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and usually don't have an issue. The services and food quality needs to be re-evaluated. For dinner crab legs and oysters for example. The oyster tray are mostly empty and you have to request for the tray to be filled. For the crab legs, they are thin and mostly empty. An employee was upset of requesting the crab legs tray filled. When filling the tray and noticed that the thongs was submerged in water, she picked up the thongs touched by dirty hands and then put the crab legs in the tray. The water was not changed and the old crab legs has been sitting there for hours. This place needs to be re-evaluated for their food and services for sure. The price has to be worth the food and services you get. Pls spread review, thanks."}
{"text":"UPDATE -   It was my mother's birthday last sunday, 25th, and of course she wanted to eat at Buffet @ Asia and  her friends and coworkers even celebrated with us.   I noticed a couple changes! Good changes. One, they had more varieties of sushi which was cool because I love sushi. However, the sushi is okay, but nothing like wow!  Second, they were serving cut pieces of lobster tails (everyone was going crazy).   Third, it isn't a soft served ice cream machine anymore. They have real ice cream that you can scoop out yourself - your choice of chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.  Sorry no gelato ice cream either or this place would be more pricey!   Overall, I was very pleased with everything. Service are always attentive. They always take our plates away the moment you slide it over. Don't have so much high expectations of this place.   You can't go wrong trying it out, the FOOD is good and the PRICE is right."}
{"text":"Very wide selection, including sushi.  Attentive staff.  Worth a do-over."}
{"text":"For what it is, Buffet at Asia is half-way decent.  It's definitely not the greatest Asian buffet, or any buffet, but it gets the job done. There are a variety of \"Asian\" favorites, mainly Chinese. Ya know, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, bbq pork, pot stickers, orange chicken, etc. Beyond the Chinese food there are a variety of other \"Asian\" foods like sushi and pad thai.  But everybody goes in for the snow crab legs. I mean, market price for these bad boys is definitely at, if not more, than the cost of entry to B@A. Actually, any of the seafood [frog legs, crab legs, lobster tail, shrimp, fish, you name it, they probably have it] is pretty good.  If soup's your game, they have a few types [wonton, egg drop, oxtail] that are worth a try.  Desserts were a little transparent. Beyond ice cream [traditional chocolate, vanilla, mix], the desserts weren't too good. The fruit, which Asian restaurants are notorious for, were weak. I saw a couple melons, grapes, and berries...and they weren't that good.  Service isn't anything to write on a postcard, but it got the job done. No small talk, no smiles, no anything. Just cleaning tables, refilling drinks, then goodbye.  Overall, I think for the price [under $15 all day] B@A is worth it."}
{"text":"couple seafood dishes I tried tasted like they were rotten and past due. I don't expect the Vegas galore buffet here, but the fact that they served expired food is NOT ALRIGHT. I would be careful eating here.."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! The owners are extremely rude, the service is horrible, and the food is not only unpalatable but is also dirty. It seems like the food has been sitting out here for ages. Came here with a tour bus and glad to never have to come back again."}
{"text":"Food was great for the money the attitude could be a little better then it will be perfect. Cashier need to smile"}
{"text":"I've been to the one on eastern and Silverado ranch and this location is better. First of, the food selection is bigger. Their dessert and salad bar have better choices as well. As far as the entrees go, they are flavorful. One of my favorites is the beef tips. Very soft so you don't have to spend a long time chewing them. The oysters were also big and not dry. They're not the freshest oysters I've ever tried but still pretty good and juicy especially in a buffet. Customer service here is average. Our waitress only checked up on us once throughout the entire meal. The location is a little far from my side of town but I will definitely go back again. Its bigger and it looks clean for the most part inside. I wish that drinks were included in the price though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and you really get a lot of value for $13 dinner. One of the reasons why I come here is because of the oysters and their seafood selection. Oysters are really big and they don't fuss when you ask them to put out some more even when they're about to close (I'm annoying when it comes to oysters,lol). They serve crab legs and Manila clams. They also have a really good desert selection. I love the sesame balls."}
{"text":"I came with an Asian tour bus group and they had more than enough seating for 30 plus of us.  $12 for lunch buffet with very sparse selection.  I didn't try the Mongolian stir-fry.  Food was mediocre and I think they only served different variations of california roll.    Verdict - I was mildly satisfied and didn't get a stomachache, so I guess that's a win."}
{"text":"Giving it a 1 star due to being really dirty and not enough variety of desserts or food and bad customer service.  I would never go back here again.  Our waiter had a bad attitude and the restaurant  overall was dirty"}
{"text":"One word.  \"DISGUSTING\".   Filthy,  food poisoning waiting to happen.  Food was old and cold."}
{"text":"It's a toss up depending on if you ask me or my husband. I liked this buffet better than Little Dumplings (on Craig Rd); my husband is the opposite. But we both agree the food it not great but decent for an asian buffet.  This buffet has a very nice selection of foods. The stations are nicely spaced apart and clean. There was a nice sushi selection; and nice selection of seafood (shrimp, salmon, frog legs, crab), a mongolian grill (you choose what you want and staff cooks it), the usual asian fare and soups, fresh fruit & chocolate for dipping, soft serve as well.   The building is an older one and the decor is old. But you're not there to eat either so it doesn't really matter to me. This buffet does offer take-out but be warned- they weigh you container to make sure it's not over 2 lbs. No joke, I saw the scale by the register.   Overall, it was something new but I don't know if we'd go here again unless we were in the area. I think we might try the other location though on Eastern... I've heard good things about that one."}
{"text":"This buffet has been on a steady decline over the last 5 years.  My first visit was October of 2005 and I thought it was amazing.  The selection was broad and the price was outrageously low.  I was introduced to this place by my cousin, who's a local, and I've been coming back ever since.  I haven't been back since March 2010.  I didn't write a review about this place then because I thought it was an off night.  It was primarily Chinese food and sushi rolls.  The dining areas looked run down and the rest room was a death trap.  Fast forward to August 2011.  Prices are still low but food quality has seriously declined.  It's strictly Chinese food now.  What throws it off is that there's a little side bar with banchan sides.  But what good is banchan if you can't pair it with Korean barbecue?  Dessert items are par for the course.  The sushi is ok, lots of fried rolls drenched with sweet sauces, and a few traditional varieties.    The dining areas are still very much rundown and the restrooms are still death traps.  But drinks were refilled right away and plates were cleared in a heartbeat.    Par for the course..."}
{"text":"Ehhh if you want to come experience the worst customer service come here!!! Self serve, self drink but you have to go to the counter to ask for it, self clean your table. Cheap everything basically."}
{"text":"Food is so oily and venue not that clean..   Expensive  for the price yet food not so great  I dont know why this place is busy considering  what i thought  about it  Won't  come back"}
{"text":"It's cheap. It's plentiful. It's tasty. It may not be healthy. But when you're craving dirty Chinese food and are hungover it'll do."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I am sitting here. James and Sandy are the worse servers I had ever encountered.  Food is okay but for $9.20 is still a ripoff. Sushi is warm. Like my boyfriend says if you don't have unagi, you should not be serving sushi. How can you serve warm watermelon that tastes funky?  Service is by far the worse I had ever experience at any restaurant. My bfs family wanted to switch to a seat where we don't have to bug each other to go in and out. From that,  they moved us all the way to the otherside. They gave us attitude while we moved out drinks and food to the other seats without thier assistance.  Then when I was done,  they passed back and forth helping everyone next or around us. Now I'm getting an upset tummy."}
{"text":"This place is filthy dirty!!!!!!!!!  The food is ok nothing to want to come back to. They really need to clean this place up. Looks like they never clean"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. I agree with other reviewers that the place was grimy, filmy, outdated and dingy. I've used bathrooms at Port Authority station that were better maintained than theirs. For that alone, I'd give them 1/5.   But then there's the food...the sushi was a hidden gem. Have I had better? Of course...even and especially in Vegas. But for the money, that was worth the trip alone. Great variety, fresh, even a few things with some imagination. The cooked food was also pretty good; there was nothing on my plate I didn't finish or that was prepared poorly. It was greasy, but I've been to greasier. So the food was 4/5.  Service was...okay. I've had worse even at a buffet. I've also had better. 3/5.   So, all in all, it kind of averages out to a 3/5. If they took a weekend and scrubbed, fixed the bathroom, got new windows and fixed the tables (and tried some kind of ambience?) the place could easily be rated much higher."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot but over time their food got pretty crappy. I went to eat here last night with my family and I had gotten some of the sushi that they served, fried rice, & egg rolls. I ate like two of the egg rolls and most of my sushi and so I was sleeping last night and all of a sudden I felt the urge to wake up and just throw up. And of course I did. I threw up a lot. That was all I ate that day too. So I'm skipping school because I got food poisoning. I was just sitting on the toilet throwing up and ya know.. but it's a great place they just need to step it up and try not to get customers sick."}
{"text":"Worst food!!! Nasty old food and terrible service!!!! After three bites I just wanted to get a refund and go, but they fought me on it. I still had to pay half price on one person. Also they were childish ignoring me with the silent treatment when I wanted a refund. They started threatening me with the police, after I said I was not going to just leave.I was willing to pay the cost of the drink, however I hardly think I should have been  charged when I took three bites of old nasty food and only spent 4 minutes in the booth, not to mention the stringy over boiled crab they were trying serve me. My fiance who was with me said the food wasn't fresh. I  would like to note neither my fiance or myself cursed or yelled at them. I did talk a little loud after a few minutes of being frustrated. But all I wanted  was a refund and being given the silent  treatment after what they had served was rediculous. 1 star because I have to pick a star."}
{"text":"Its ok when you go here at lunch its only $10 or so but at dinner.... Maybe you shouldnt its $17 and its doesnt worth it at all. The customer service is pretty horrible."}
{"text":"Not bad for a buffet.  About $8/person for lunch.  Decent variety."}
{"text":"The only things that were good are the walnut shrimp and the fried rice. Everything else was bleh..."}
{"text":"Very busy place. Large variety including my favorite, plantain (they call it fried bananas). Place is always packed so be prepared for a few minutes wait. At least food is continuously being prepared."}
{"text":"So far I've been here probably over 200 times. Any time any family member comes to Vegas this is the place to go. My rating is 5 stars for the good. Honestly one of the best buffets I've ever had BUT it has to be on the weekend. I have only ever gone on the weekend and their seafood is to die for.  I came on a weekday last week for the first time and it's not the same. Do yourself a favor and come on the seafood days. If I went on weekdays my review might be different.  I've read most of the reviews and it seems most people are giving them a low raising because their service is THE WORST. I completely agree. Their service is complete trash. But their food is heavenly. They pretty much don't care. If their service was better I believe the would have 5 stars.  Their sushi is the best bugger sushi I've ever had and usually buffet sushi is terrible. The spicy shrimp is to die for. Actually one of my all time favorite foods. I crave them constantly. And then there's the grab. Unlimited all you can eat crab legs. Are you kidding me?! I've bought a few legs at the store which cost the same as the buffet and you can have unlimited here. My dad eats probably over $100 of crab legs himself. The food is fantastic I recommend. I'm so used to the terrible service I just ignore it. But I'm rating them on their food not their service."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that if you are low on cash and want to eat at an Asian buffet this is the place to go. My wife and I went here due to indecisiveness and lazy to drive else where.   Moreover the staff is quite friendly and pretty quick at serving the beverages. However the food...how can I say this...the food was sooo bland no taste. And for some reason right when I get my food and then sit down the food is already cold. Luckily we got there at dinner where they gave us more options. For example crabs legs, but even though the taste of the crab legs something was off. The butter for the crab legs taste like if it was old butter just being reused.   I hate to give them such of a low rating but the fact that i couldn't eat another plate because of the taste and that my wife and I felt sick mildly sick afterwards. So like I said if your low on cash and want a buffet I would recommend but if you don't have a strong stomach and have taste preferences don't."}
{"text":"So, I give it a one star. Reason being that the food is okay. Not bad but the customer service is so horrid you have to laugh.  I have come to this place a few times thinking their customer service will be at least better but it is not. As soon as you come in everyone has a face as if they just stepped in a pile of you know what. The waiters look at you and say, \"What do you want?\" instead of introducing themselves and asking what kind of beverage you would like. I was so upset once with a waiter. I asked for a refill he went to get it and threw it on the table. I had to grab it because it was sliding through the table and if i would of let it go it would of been pored all over me. One time I called to see what the wait time was and the woman said and i quote,\" We are busy stop calling.\" and hung up. Oh and please do not try to stand up for yourself because you should be grateful that they are giving you their attention at all. LMAO! I mean, if you are into people treating you like nothing this is your place. Or if you want a laugh come over. I promise you that it is just so ridiculous. Worst of all the manager will treat you bad as well . Make sure if you want to come here you come with a sense of humor because if not you will be appalled with their customer service. It sucks that my grandfather likes it so much or else I would never come here."}
{"text":"Decent selection of typical Chinese buffet fare. Service was good but the restaurant wasn't super clean. Price was reasonable for Las Vegas. We visited other casino buffets and this place is about average and slightly better."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!! Assaulting people!!!! Bad bad servers. horrible experience. Food good price not so good. Charges extra for big groups. Automatically charges tip.   Family vacation ruined.  Lady pushed my aunt for no reason and came at the rest of the family. Trying to kick us out for no reason. Terrible terrible!   Calling police."}
{"text":"Cheap but the food wasn't good. Steak needed seasoning, orange chicken was soggy and the only thing that tasted ok to me was the sweet and sour chicken and fried rice."}
{"text":"Great selection for the price, the lunch buffet had tons of Chinese food, sushi, fries and fried chicken. left there stuffed.  Dinner on Friday-Sunday includes a seafood buffet, but the price increases as well."}
{"text":"MSG, MSG, MSG!!! I got headache after one hour of dining here. I will not eat again in a cheap buffet."}
{"text":"Went to this place before I flew out. It wasn't priced bad at 15.99 for friday dinner. They had steam crab legs, lobster pieces and various sushi. I was scared to go here based on some rating but it wasn't bad at all. I'm from my and the weekend buffet price is usually 20plus. The service is good but the woman who collects the money can sometimes come off as pushy. They had Tom yung soup which was a nice surprise. Don't expect the world but know you'll find something you'll like."}
{"text":"Food is really enjoyable.  Sushi is mouth-wateringly fantastic!  Better than any sushi place where you'll pay $50+.  They also have pad thai noodles, real ice cream, Chinese, kimchi and a variety of asian dishes.  However, the bathrooms rival that of a dive bar.  Smelly, sticky, graffiti and paper towels not always available.  Overall the quality of the food wins!"}
{"text":"I would rate this as 3 stars... but my boyfriend is trying to insist I give it 4 stars. He really enjoyed the oysters and sashimi and a couple other choice items. Otherwise, I found everything to be A-OK... like the 3 star rating I gave it. I'm not sure it was worth the 15$ a person, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. We'll see if he can convince me to go back..."}
{"text":"I think this place is the best Asian food buffet in Las Vegas, maybe even in the USA if you compare price/quality!  The food is authentic and always fresh because it is always crowded so the containers of food have to be refreshed often  The price is ridiculously cheap especially considering all the sushi and seafood dishes they have.  The wait staff is amazingly attentive to everything the customers need from picking up your dirty dishes to refilling your beverage.  My wife and friends love this place."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting! It was not even warm. There was dessert that smelled like toilet bowl cleaner. The service was poor as well. I should have known better when there was a sign at the front door that said \"absolutely no refunds\". If zero stars were an option on here, that is what I would have given them."}
{"text":"I don't know why this location has the lowest rating. I think the staff at this spot is by far the friendliest out of all the locations I've been to. We come here on the weekend for lunch pretty much every week. There aren't necessarily a ton of options, but it's good food, cooked fresh, and cheap for the whole family to eat. Pair that with the friendly service and it's always been a good experience! The bathrooms could be cleaner, but that's literally my only gripe with this spot. You can now get made-to-order Mongolian BBQ plates with your meal also."}
{"text":"Certainly one of our favorite places to go whenever we're in Vegas. Abundant variety of dishes and the oxtail soup is super yummy. Great friendly  wait staff."}
{"text":"Haven't written a review in awhile so I'll start 2016 fr3sh with buffet asia!! I'm on that clean eating so gotta get that grilled steak and chicken. Started with a salad you know.  Healthy shit. White rice for that clean carb action. The staff didn't really speak English but we're of much help. They're water refilling service was on point tonight. A+. What else could you eat for 13 bucks for this fantastic bargain. Shit if I went to bwws I would of spent the same thing.. with alcohol tho. I'd be drunk. Anyways I approve of this establishment. Good job south side buffet asia. 5 stars for the water refillment not even Jupiter himself could accomplish"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food selection is great - lots of things to choose from. The kitchen  staff keeps up with the demand very well; the food is always hot and the pans are always full of food. The service is superb - I usually post a lot about bad service but this buffet gets two thumbs up for service. The best thing about this staff is that they speak English - I don't have to point to things and shake my head here...they understand my needs and respond very well, which is a big plus for me. The price for a Sunday dinner is about $15/person....reasonably low priced for the excellent food and service. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a review about the one on Rainbow and Flamingo. I cannot speak to the others.  I am married into an Asian family and we mostly eat Asian food so I have been in Asian eateries high and low in many cities. This is one to avoid.  I was joking with my sons the management must pay kids to pick up the dead shellfish that wash ashore with the morning tide and this is what they deep fry to cover up the spoiled taste which did not get past us. Most people go for the \"all you can eat crab\" but it was more like \"all you can keep down.\" The rest of the offerings were OK but pretty standard low-end offerings heavy on the fried side. Frankly, several of us felt ill the rest of the evening. Never again."}
{"text":"Yuk.   Smelly sushi, limited selection of flavorless food items.  Yuk.  Why oh why did I come here?  Atmosphere was kind of dingy.  Service....well it is a buffet so do we really need much effort?  Oh no....this will not do.  Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I don't know about you but $ 17 for an average asian buffet is a rip off... ...that is...unless...it's an Asian buffet like this one.   Their food isn't too sweet, nor to salty. It's actually really good.   Buffet @ Asia offers a huge large selection Asian food from seafood (clams, muscles, crab), Chinese food (stir fries, orange chicken, hot and sour soup...), to any Asian food you may be craving (pad Thai, sushi). They even have Mongolian Barbecue!   The restaurant gets really crowded and service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant; a buffet at that!  Waiters were always refilling drinks and taking away plates. It's seriously like they're watching you like an eagle-- taking the last bite on your plate before swooping in and taking your finished plate away.  They're incredibly on top of things.    If you're ever in Vegas and don't feel like eating at the hotel buffets, make a little detour off strip and stop on by here. I doubt they'd disappoint."}
{"text":"I friends took us to their favorite buffet last weekend.  I love this place!   Tasty food with a lot of choices!  Very reasonable prices for lobster buffet during weekend dinners!  Highly recomended!!!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town the food here is fresh and delicious. Don't come here for the service come here for the food. If you want service go to a restaurant not a buffet. But I have to atmit the customers I saw here are not very kind. Kinda felt sorry for the staffing. I understand why they are quick to get u what you are going to drink and get out the way. They are very good at clearing your table and keeping it clean so u can eat comfortable definitely worth it"}
{"text":"We were here with the tour group.   The service: They will pick up cash from table to table. If you swipe the card? they will charge you extra.   I don't eat buffet too much and I don't  like buffet at all, but this is the worst buffet  that I ever had.   Everything on the sushi counter taste the same: Kewpie mayonnaise. Customized fresh wok vegetables, meat and noodle smells great, but it tasted bland.  Fried snacks are tasteless and soggy. Fried cheese wrap is disgusting. There is no taste, no flavor and the cheese filling is dry. The rest dishes on the counter is over salted. Everything taste the same, it was all cooked with soy sauce.  Steamed bun/steam cake is edible.  Desserts cake is classic and it's okay. Green jelly is gross. It was sour and bitter, I have no idea what that is and what that suppose to be.  Totally inedible.   This place is even worse than Panda express.  If I had the choice on that day? I will never walk into that place."}
{"text":"Giving it 4 reviews amidst a sea of 1s, 2s, and 3s. Let me tell you why.  Buffet Asia doesn't hide what it is. It is an affordable, decent buffet plain and simple.  The food is decent and for the price you pay, I'd say it is more than worth it. Regarding the foot traffic, service, attentiveness - it is something you can expect from a very busy place. But anyone who has eaten here knows how it goes. You get there, you get your class of water / softdrink and you have to assume it will be a while before you get a refill.   But still, the food is good, it is all you can eat at a price lower than most places. If you get a bunch of experienced go-ers and eat there, then the experience is good."}
{"text":"If this restaurant were a bathroom, I would have fortified my bladder and left for a better alternative. The stench in the main dining area contains elements of body odor, urine, and chemical cleaner.   As for the food: greasy, limp, over salted, slimy, and with the cheapest grade materials.   The sushi bar simply consists of a dozen different presentations of a California roll- only two perhaps had a smear of fish.   Drinks not included.   $10.99 for lunch.   Skip. Unless you like eating in a toilet themed restaurant. If that's your style, this is your jackpot."}
{"text":"The sushi was surprisingly really good, but the rest of the food was mediocre. The place was clean and service was decent. It's no five star buffet, but my experience was much nicer than the previous reviewers. I would recommend for large parties as there are many options, especially for kids."}
{"text":"Not the best chinese buffet that I've been to but not the worst either. The fried rice, cream cheese wontons, and chicken skewers are pretty good. I didn't try the sushi or mongolian bbq section. $14 for dinner...seemed a little high for the quality. I prob won't go back."}
{"text":"To me Buffet@Asia is quite good in every aspects.  1.food selections: Excellent  Not only Chinese dishes are served in this restaurant but they also offer Thai,Japanese,Korean as well as  Mongolian BBQ,seafood,salad bar,fruit and ice-cream.  2.Taste of food: Good  3.Service: excellent service  The staffs are attentive and move in a fast pace.They remove plates  very quick unlike other buffet that let your plates stack up.  4.Cleanliness: Good The staffs clean the floor regularly.  5.Price: Excellent It is quite cheap and you get a bit more than you pay.Less than $10 dollars for lunch and $less than$21 dollars for AYCE seafood dinner.can't beat that.   Good for big party,family as well as  kids friendly"}
{"text":"Service isnt good. Food is terrible. And the place is always dirty and unkept. I come here with my grandparents because they like how cheap it is but I've gone to buffets in the same price range that still have edible food that isn't all mush and MSG. Two times that we came there were cockroaches or dead bugs in the corner which makes me feel even more hesitant to try their food."}
{"text":"Let me explain the three stars...  5 stars for the dinner price of $16.95 at today's prices. 4 stars for having lobster in a $16.95 AYCE dinner price. Don't get too excited. They're just pieces of lobster tail amongst large crab pieces.  2 stars for cleanliness of the dining areas and the buffet area. 4 stars for having beef/oxtail soup exactly the way my mom used to make it (Filipino style) 2 stars for service. Friendliness and courtesy, not their thing. 1 star for the experience of dining with the other customers. It was super annoying. I can't generalize that everyone who dines here is annoying. But the night we ate there, this was the overwhelming majority. And my parents like eating here, yet they say it's always like that there. What was so annoying? Large parties with undisciplined kids running around with no supervision or correction. People literally standing in front of the lobster pot waiting for them to replenish it. Seriously? Social graces much? There are a lot of selections. Remember this is an AYCE for $16.95 dinner. You might overlook some of the low scores.  Skip the sushi. Don't waste your calories on that. Having the crabs, crabs & lobster, fish and beef/oxtail soup, are well worth your money, and enough to pay a return visit, I suppose. You decide what my scores mean to you.  I don't know yet if I'd return, but I'm not completely opposed to it. I just don't like eating while stressed and annoyed. And the other patrons can't help themselves."}
{"text":"I have been to this place, probably 4 times. I consider it four stars because of two things, the price and the product. The decor, and cleanliness can be a little bit better. First off the price was 8$ lunch, 13$ dinner. For what they offer, it is a steal, compared to other asian buffets.  My favorites are the beef tenderloin; juicy and soft. the mussels, baked with mayo and cheese, its like a heart attack waiting to happen, but its so goood. they have frog legs, and they are actually pretty good. wings are ok, but everyone seems to horde the crab leg station, i never do because I am allergic to it. Mostly typical buffet food, they do try to copy the PF Changs, lettuce wraps, and FAIL, i have no gripe about that, because it's not PF Changs, it's a buffet, i have no time to wrap lettuce..im there to EAT. anyways, the real steal of the buffet is, sushi. It's awesome, impressive even. Figure this, if you get an 8 pc roll at other places and they are all the same, it would cost you maybe 7-9$. well you pay 8$ lunch, but could get one piece of each. So it definitely is worth it, even if you just went for Sushi. All in all, this is a place you would take your family or a big group of people, everyone will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Really really scary... they had put times on the sneeze guards... most i saw ranged from 2:45 pm to 6:45 pm and 3:19 pm to 7:19 pm, it was 7:45 pm.... the tuna on the \"sushi\" bar was questionable. I think tuna is supposed to be red/pink not grey/green?   The seating was also uncomfortable. I plopped down in the booth, expecting some cushion... ouch, nope... my husbands side had padding, though...  I will not be returning..."}
{"text":"It is ok if your hungry. Problem I have is that the staff is rather rude. I don't know if it is a culture thing or just the way the staff is. I had dirt in my miso soup which curbed my eating for the day. I was glad to get something to eat as this is my families favorite spot in LV but I am going to watch what I eat next time."}
{"text":"This place kicks butt.  The only negative is that if I eat here more often, I would be a big tub of goo...   Best days are to go on Fridays and Saturday ~ seafood night.  Come early; otherwise, there may be a wait and the food may not be as fresh as late in the night.  Usually, I focused on the crab legs and the oysters.  When it is oysters season, this places rocks!  It has the freshest oysters that we have ever had in Vegas.  By the way, we ate at the Southpointe casino the other day and their oysters like yuck....  As for the crab legs, large and juicy.  Yummy!  Atmosphere -- it is a buffet folks Service -- seems alot of young chinese people ~ probably students.  They do work hard.   Price -- it is about $20.. much better and more affordable than the strip at $35-40 bucks per head...   I love this place.  If I could eat here everyday, it would be awesome... My cholesterol and weight would go through the roof.    Definitely, one of the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"Freshest food I have EVER seen on a chinese buffet!  I have eaten at a few different chinese buffets, including the Buffet Asia on the other side of town. I was a little taken aback today when we were charged $8.99 apiece (plus tax), but to be honest, it was worth every penny. Everything was not only fresh and beautiful, but each and every item had a sticker above it with the time that it had been brought out! Wow! Impressive!  The sushi was beautiful, there were plenty of delicious choices, and there was an abundance of ginger and wasabi. The fresh fruit was just that - fresh, and many choices. I personally LOVE the mongolian grill, and this one is my favorite because they used paper thin slices of meat-chicken, pork and beef, and all of the sides I love: water chestnuts, sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, garlic, baby corn, celery, etc. Mmmm, super good.   I'm just very impressed. The place was clean, the food not only looked good, but was delicious. Sometimes at a chinese buffet, I take little bits, because I either don't know what it is, or I want to try it to see if it tastes good. Not necessary here. Everything I took was delicious! Oh, and the service was also very attentive.   In reference to Meg H. on Aug 16, we had iced tea, and the girl refilled it every few minutes, however, if you order thai tea, there is an extra charge for that.  My mother, who eats like a bird, had just had outpatient surgery and we went straight to eat afterwards. She ate like a logger! I don't think I've ever seen her eat so much! Go mom!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great buffet! It's cheap and the food quality is great! It's not to far from the strip so that was awesome for me!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a buffet.  I'm not too much into buffets but since I was in Vegas and you can't leave Vegas without a buffet...This one was a great one to go too especially if you're tired of the Vegas Steak prime rib specials.  The seafood was fresh, the food was always served hot, and the wait staff was pretty prompt about making sure the tables were clean, plates were taken soon after finishing a mean, and the drinks were always refilled.    My sister actually had her wedding reception here and they did a good job accomodating us, EXCEPT, when the wanted to seat other guests in the area my sister reserved.  That I felt was kind of rude...  A Buffet is a buffet so I don't know what else to say bout it, but HMMMMM deliciouso...."}
{"text":"The food is terrible and the service is very bad. Never eat here. We went to eat there, but the waitress is so mean. And the food is not good and old food. The receptionist is impolite."}
{"text":"I'm going to give you a hint, so read between the lines. If you like good food and care about what you eat, don't go here! If you can't tell the difference and don't care about quality then this is the place for you. Bland would have been an improvement for slightly spoiled cheap seafood that is unquestionably on its way out to the garbage. The service is virtually non existent."}
{"text":"This is our first Chinese buffet in Vegas and it is worth every penny! The sushi selection offers a wide variety and they have plenty of seafood dishes without an extra charge. We came for lunch and were both able to fill up for less than $20 (before tip). The servers are all attentive and polite- there's even chairs outside for the smokers. Very cool! We're sold!"}
{"text":"extremely poor service.  None refund policy is totally BS to protect their profit.  Our parties of 6 were separated into 2 groups and was seated in 2 separate sections inside restaurant.  When we complaint, they told us we were free to leave.  NO REFUND!  We were not even seated.  Never return there again!"}
{"text":"Okay quality food.  Not much to eat.  I did enjoy the malnourished crab legs.  They crab legs had hardly any meat in the shells.  The sandy oysters were not great either just full of sand. Not that great here.  I would not return.  I gave it an extra star since it was affordable."}
{"text":"We were looking for a local buffet for our Chinese/Japanese/Seafood moods and this place totally fits the bill!  The selection and variety of food is great and the price is very reasonable!  Everything was tasty and fresh - what more could you ask for from a buffet?"}
{"text":"The food is horrible and every waiter here gives out unprofessional costumer service, they walk around and talk about people in their language and laugh. They do not clean the table, you have to ask them for their service which is horrible. We have went up and complained to the manager that our plates were not picked up by the waiters and it was said to me to tell my waiter and seemed they did not care. I had to get up and ask for my drinks because the whole time we were sitting down eating they were not giving us refills and not picking up our plates. We've been coming to this buffet  for quite a while and they treat us as if we didn't pay for our meal. We will not be coming back to this buffet again."}
{"text":"Been twice-1 dinner,1 lunch. Unbeatable lunch price- I was really just going in for sushi, and barely ate that due to the vast selections. I ate things I don't identify/recognize.  Dinner time I had fried, skin off frog legs, which exceeded my expectations. Loved the garlic clams and mayo mussels to no end!! Good soups (didn't try the oxtail; a little unusual for me, maybe next time.) Can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"This place was \"OK.\" It was pretty busy when we went so the food was turning over quickly, which by reading the other reviews was a good thing. I was really afraid I was going to get sick  off this place. Thankfully I didn't get sick, but I definitely wasn't raving it was the best food either.   I got a couple plates- chow mein, fried rice, chicken on a stick (i really dont know what it was called), a few other things... and everything was average. The sushi was better than grocery sushi, but still a largely noticeable difference to an actual sushi restaurant. Plus one of the rolls was warm when I bit into it, instant fear and regret set over me. I'd like to thank my stomach of steel for saving me from that one. I got a plate of crab legs, saying to my friend \"you can't screw up crab legs.\" But I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, the taste was fine... but just about every other piece I cracked open didn't have any meat in it! Crab legs are not easy to open so I was definitely not happy about that. The best tasting thing I had was the baked bananas, those were delicious.  The dessert was average... below actually. I got this little cake with pink frosting on top. No real flavor to it. What I think was ambrosia... but it was nothing but marshmallows (isn't it supposed to have fruit?), and a soft serve. The texture was... off, but the taste was ok.   We didn't have any problems with the service. The lady was nice and after getting our drinks pretty much left us alone. Considering it cost about $15 to eat here at dinner time, I won't be back. For $15 I could've got a MUCH better meal elsewhere and not had to fear for my life."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat on Sundays after church.i always eat sushi,frog legs ,salads and all types of meats so can't say hows the rice and chow mein.Service is good,ure gonna have ur glass full at all times.lunch $7.99 plus $1.25 drink,dinner $11.99 on weekends little more.I would eat here everyday if I could"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!! BEWARE. DO NOT EAT HERE. I am disputing charged with my credit card company and will be contacting other sources."}
{"text":"Visited today and 30 minutes after we left my mommy was throwing up and pooping all over herself! I reported it to the health department. I am curious if anyone else got sick. Any number of food items could have been the culprit. We ate the exact same things except for CLAMS and her drinking Diet Coke. I guess it was the CLAMS that did it. I am more than a few hours away from eating there and no signs of illness for me. Please post if you get sick, it could be a big problem that goes unseen."}
{"text":"This location was the cleanest and best but after eating here last Wednesday it was horrible. The service was the same as usual which is really bad and the tables were filthy. The tables and seats had oil all over from previous customers eating and wiping their hands on the seat. You would think that they'd clean the tables and seats after a customer leaves. The whole place is just nasty. Then the people that change the food out don't even wear gloves. When they change out the trays they put the left overs on top of the new without gloves. Don't waste your money especially your time!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out this new location for awhile now because it's pretty close to my home and all I can say is that I've experienced better.   The service was okay. The cashiers were nice, but the servers who refilled our drinks and took our plates acted like they didn't want to be there. Have a little bit of enthusiasm for your work or you won't go anywhere in life. They had a better variety of entrees and desserts than the Flamingo location, but they don't have Mongolian BBQ.   I ate here only a few hours ago, but I am already experiencing a sour stomach. The food here is soooooooooo greasy. I was feeling sick at the table because of the insane amount of grease! I love dessert though and their tapioca pudding is the best.  Anyway, this place was okay, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I know that buffet is very cheap and get full. But food don't taste good  Customer service is not great:(  I better go Panda Express  I'm not gonna be back ...."}
{"text":"We recently visited this restaurant in Las Vegas.  We were there for a rehearsal dinner.  Talk about a night market nightmare.  I typically enjoy a CLEAN Asian buffets. This was by far NOT clean.  The first impression was that the buffet was not maintained and a complete HOT MESS.  There was food all over the buffet with possible contaminations.  What was even worse was that the bathrooms look like it was straight out of a horror film movie.  My recommendations to guest considering eating at this place scope out the bathroom first than look at the buffet counters and make your own decisions.  Dirty Bathroom = Dirty Kitchen  Lost my appetite for any Asian buffets for at least a year.  We had 30 people in our party and 6 of us had issues thereafter dinning there.  Warning to all who eats there!"}
{"text":"came here cause i seen they had sapporos and sushi. but when i i got there they hadn't been serving sapporos for a week,the sushi looked old, and sadly they didn't have oysters either. not that i would have ate them after seeing the condition the sushi was in but over all i was disappointed in this place. thought some ice cream would help but two of the 3 options were unavailable :( *tear"}
{"text":"Not all Buffet @Asia restaurants are the same. If you have been to another one in Las Vegas and were disappointed, try this one! Large real sushi selections and plently of other delicious items. For dinner they add frog legs, ribs, shrimp and crab. Dinged them a star for recently raising the prices and also having disgusting restrooms."}
{"text":"Pretty good food selection - most food was very fresh, because they are very busy and have fast turnaround.  The sushi is meh, nothing special, no sashimi.  They make you pay at the door when you walk in - price is with drink included, tip at that time or at table after dining.  VERY BUSY when I went around Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet for years, I pretty much grew up eating here. This place definitely deserves its 3 stars; however I just had the worst experience after years of eating here.   I'm not entirely sure if the management has changed throughout the years, but whoever hired these waiters and the grill master must not have taken their applications seriously.   My first bad experience happened the second I was seated. The waiter rolled his eyes at my party members for taking a little while on deciding what they wanted to drink. He was paying so little attention to us that he even got 2 out of 6 drinks wrong.  Second, I remembered how much I used to love making my own Mongolian barbeque because of how friendly the old grill master used to be... however, not quite this time. I had to call him twice just to get his attention and he definitely ignored me both times because after the third time I asked him to make my order spicy, he told me to go and grab the sauce myself. Sorry grill master, but no tip for you this time.  Lastly, the same waiter that made a fuss about getting my drinks was taking my plates away. This time, this guy manages to spill all the pot sticker sauce all over my table and on my girlfriend's seat while she was gone. The guy never apologized and just simply up and left our table in a mess.  Needless to say I didn't tip these bastards one cent for their horrid service. I would've been better off getting my own drink and making my own barbeque. Like I said, this place probably deserves its 3 stars from years of eating here, but never again will I be visiting Buffet @ Asia."}
{"text":"Ah, my mastication sanctuary. I will not eat 24 hours in advance to come and gorge here, as my mobile photo uploads on Facebook will attest to.   At under $9 for lunch and under $15 for dinner, why not? The food isn't bad and once you've found your favorites, you'll find that the quality is consistent whenever you come in.   The value of this place is reason enough to try it. Thai iced tea is a free drink option and I've heard beer is as well (just ask). Even at lunch there is plenty of seafood, beef, and chicken. They recently added some veggie/tofu items as well. The sushi bar isn't fancy, but the basics are here (tuna, salmon, eel, etc.). Dinner isn't too different from lunch, but the addition of crab legs is definitely something worthy of coming here after 3pm. Either way, the food... tasty!  Now, on to the service. It's pretty unusual to have an empty drink or used plate on the table for very long. The staff is pretty on top of this.  As with just about any other buffet, it's not quite like ordering a la carte at an Asian restaurant, but I always leave here satisfied and is definitely somewhere I look forward to going with the family."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Asian food, sorry this isn't the place. Definitely Americanized everything here. Pretty much an AYCE Panda Express minus the awesome taste. Went in for lunch and the selection was pretty limited.  You get what you pay for. The one thing I'm glad they didn't mess up were the fried donuts. Literally filled up on desserts.... The service isn't there and shouldn't expect much, I mean it's a buffet :)  Don't think I'm curious enough to try lunch. Would rather spend that money for a single meal."}
{"text":"The price is great.  The sushi at this buffet of asia is better than most sushi bars I've been to with a great selection and all you can eat.  I notice that the sushi is changed regularly and has been fresh every time I've gone to this location.  The reason it lost a star is simply because of the seating and customer service.  Two times I've been I have had an empty drink sit in front of me for over ten minutes.  Once I get the attention of the staff it gets filled. Other then that this place is a diamond in the rough for locals to las vegas."}
{"text":"They probably have the best seafood selection (for what you pay for) out of all the chinese buffets in the valley. The only bad thing is it's really warm/hot in there almost like the AC isn't on."}
{"text":"I went in with my expectations appropriately lowered after reading all the reviews, and you know what?  I wasn't disappointed.  First off, this is a great deal for lunch.  $9 + tip and that includes a drink.  I went in around 3:15 and stayed for the shiftover to \"dinner\" at 3:45 and it was exactly the same thing, with the added benefit of a steak (and something else) cooked to order.  I found that they had a fair range of items; all the staples of fast food Chinese--orange chicken, honey chicken, teriyaki chicken, spare ribs, Mongolian BBQ...plus more.  I wasn't too happy with the actual taste of the choices, but for $9 it can't be beat.    I probably won't be returning, but I don't regret trying it out.  I guess I'd prefer a classic \"around the world\" buffet that includes Asian specialties among others."}
{"text":"Don't ever order catering because you will get ripped off!  Or make sure to check your order before you pay.  I ordered one full tray and a half tray during Xmas eve.  Staff helped me load them in my car, upon loading them, I noticed that the trays were the same size and insisted the lady that I ordered one full tray and the other one a half tray.  The lady then was getting impatient and said they use the same trays for a full order or a half tray.  The half tray will just be half of that tray.  So I gave her the benefit of the doubt.  Went home and found out I overpaid.  2 half trays instead of 1 full $35.  The food was just ok.  This is a shady business practice.  Shame on this restaurant.  I should've opened the trays before paying.  I won't be trusting Chinese restaurants anymore."}
{"text":"The perfect place to take the family if you enjoy food poisoning. Don't waste your time here. Nothing tastes fresh, the sushi is left at an unsettling temperature, and it was pretty obvious that very little care is taken in bussing tables so you'll be sticking to yours."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend who eats here often (my first time). This is an inexpensive Asian buffet. There must have been 30 different choices including a variety of sushi, beef ribs, mussels, a couple of shrimp options, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, noodle dishes, wan tons, fresh cut fruit, almond cookies, fried donuts, and soft serve \"ice cream.\" were any of the dishes gourmet quality. Nope. But this is a $9 buffet for lunch. If your expectation is an upscale sit down restaurant, you are going to be disappointed. But if you compare this meal to an under $10 fast food meal, definitely 4 star. Also more generous with the rating because the staff was very pleasant and friendly. Would come back when looking for an unrushed, inexpensive fast food meal."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good. I read the other reviews and I think that people need to keep an open mind on this buffet. This place is clean and the staff is friendly. The food was almost the same as the one in Eastern. For $6.99 (lunch) their food would satisfy anyone who is low on budget. Their sushi was great and I liked their oxtail soup. The best part was you get to scoop your own ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry). And their boba was good as well. Try this place and check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Food was not fresh. Either bland or super salty.   Loud kids all over the place locked up in a small dining room.   Chinese waitress had a stank face with a bad attitude.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Just ate here. The location in Henderson isn't bad, but this one is terrible! Big fat people will mow you down to get at the food! The food is cooked hours earlier. It is overcooked and dry. Everything tastes horrible! The restaurant is outdated. The restaurant is dirty and had piles of dirty plates etc, sitting in bins, from bussed tables. The restrooms have no soap or paper towels in the dispensers! They are dirty and some of the toilets are clogged! I will never eat at a Buffet Asia again! Yuck!"}
{"text":"This used to be a decent buffet but not anymore. The cashier had an unpleasant attitude, as well as the guy who was cooking the Mongolian BBQ. There was a bell to ring when ready to order & I rung the bell  & still he took his sweet time. I asked the cashier if he could hear the bell & instead of her going to get him she told me that I just have to wait. The food was not that good in selection or flavor. The crab legs were dry, tasteless & overcooked. I went to bathroom to wash my hands & the cashier came out of the stall & walked out of restroom without washing hers. I told my server that I hope she doesn't touch any food because she just left the bathroom without washing her hands. My server just smiled & said nothing. After seeing that I was done with this place. Never again will I be back."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting. It looks as if it was left out in the open for days straight. The Chinese food doesn't even taste legitimate. I couldn't find anything even appealing to eat. Horrible environment. Just don't even bother."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place , so my other half and I decided to try it out to see what the fuss was about. First let me  start by how fast they seated us and got our drinks , they constantly removed dirty dishes from the table and constantly refilled our drinks they checked to see if we were okay here and there.  Their food was AMAZiNG I tasted every dish I put on my plate it was yummy & I also got their mangolian !!!Their service was amazing !!!! And we're can you go wrong with all you can eat with a great price !!!! I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good seafood for dinner. Good Sushi bar looks like they have 30 or more. Good price, good food & service."}
{"text":"Decent-enough buffet: lots of seafood and traditional Asian dishes here, though the salads and dessert sections are minimal. A few fried and Americanized options available, making this place a bit more kid-friendly than you might expect.  Found it odd that this place also has a full bar?  Sushi roll offerings at dinnertime are extensive: several special rolls, though they are not labeled, so be prepared to try a lot or be able to identify the types of fish you do/don't like. Some nigiri available, too. Lots of crab, preference was for the salt and pepper fried Jonah crab claws rather than the typical Alaskan.   $13/person weeknight dinner is not outrageous, and you can easily get your money's worth here, but this place isn't likely to blow your mind. Service is also what you'd expect for an Asian buffet, no surprises there."}
{"text":"Yes, this is cheap buffet food but it's great for lunches and Friday night dinners. Why? For the selection of food for lunch, where else can the best bang for your buck? There is a great selection of sushi, beef, shrimp, frog legs, and ox tail soup. For me, that's all good enough for something under $10. As for Friday night dinner, there is lobster and crab legs and crawfish here. Now, the lobster is pretty good. The crab legs and crawfish is mediocore. This place is always packed and seats a lot of people. It has the main room and 3 other separate rooms. Why does it get such low reviews from some people, I'm not sure. Did you expect to pay under $10 and get Bellgio or Wynn buffet quality?"}
{"text":"My friends basically MADE me come check this place out. I'll give 3 stars because there is a large sushi selection. That doesn't mean it's good, that just means they offer a larger selection than most Asian buffets I've been to. I actually think the sushi was all the same just assembled differently. The buffet itself was disappointingly small as far as food selection. For roughly $9 for lunch it could've been worse. The lo mein had to have been the best menu option in my opinion, that and the crab rangoons."}
{"text":"This buffet @ Asia has better food quality, but the people at the front look so mean. Like I mean we came in and paid for ourselves $15 a person and the lady that seated us gave me such a stink face like what the hell? And then she seated us and didn't ask us for our drink orders she just walked away. So some Asian lady asked us what we wanted to drink but these workers don't know a lot of English. Any ways the place isn't like spotless clean it's actually kinda dirty, and the place is crowded with people and the bathroom is pretty dirty I would say stick to the buffet @ Asia on Sahara pls that one is the better one"}
{"text":"I give 0 stars!!! I just passed by that was very hot day , I asked very nicely for a glass of water  The Chinese girl in the front refused the give me and she said she will not give a\"free water\"  And I can buy  She was very rude and unpleasant - I would never refuse someone for water I left shocked"}
{"text":"You get what you pay..if you are on a budget and don't mind eating limited selection then this is the place. Service is not bad.."}
{"text":"Visit here every time I'm in Vegas. It is the best location of their branch. Crab legs continually are bought out. Love their oysters and sushi bar. Prices very fair."}
{"text":"I'll give it four stars only because for the $8 and some change per head it's not bad.  Unless you get the Mongolian BBQ the food never really tasted completely fresh. So, I'd be hesitant to eat the sushi.  Although, this place has potential. I'd be willing to pay $10-12 if they stepped it up a little. Fresher food, a little cleaning/renovation (has an old school feel) maybe.  Lastly, for the price it might have been an enjoyable experience if they refused service to the lady sitting next to us (horrible body odor)."}
{"text":"Back in August the whole family came for dinner for my grandmas birthday. The service was terrible. Today we decided to give them a second chance. If I could give them a negative rating I would. While eating lunch, my son noticed something slippery under his shoe. He thought it was water. When we looked, we saw it was vomit. We moved our family of 5 to another table and told the waiter we were going to sit there. He said No, we can't sit there. We said, well there is vomit under that table. He said, I clean and got a broom to sweep it up. We did not want to sit there but he said we had to. We sat back down and my husband could still feel the floor being slick. He went and told the \"manager\". She said sorry, no refunds. Another waiter came over and told us to move and he would sweep again. We got up to leave. My husband demanded a refund. We finally got one and the manager lady called him a jerk.  I reported them to the health district."}
{"text":"Lunch on a monday only $10 per adult?! Thats super cheap. But I would probably never come here for dinner prices.   Yes, its an asian buffet if you haven't already noticed from their name. & with asian buffets, you can NEVER have high expectations.  Try a little bit of everything, then stick to what you like.  Things that I liked the most were: - Baked Mussels - Cream Cheese Wontons - Chinese Donuts - Fried Shrimp - Oxtail Soup - Tom Yum Seafood Soup - Dumplings - Fried Chicken Wings - Soft Serve Ice Cream  Everything else was whatever.  At least I can say that it was clean.  I wish there was more seafood, but obviously it only comes out during dinner time. Other than that, I wouldn't pay more than $10.  Quick, easy, decent buffet for those under the budget."}
{"text":"I boycotted tho place today when about to pay for my mom my sister's n mine good when the cashier told me to make sure to leave a good tip to my server. Excuse Me, but a good tip is earn not force to be given. #Bad service, force to tip"}
{"text":"Well let me say that I was suprised to see how busy this place was on a Monday night.  With an open mind I met some people there for an xmas party.  They were able to accomidate our party of 14 within 30 minutes.  As for the food, well, its basic Asian food done in a good way.  The mongolian BBQ station was nice and the seafood was in abundence for those who like it.  All this for 11.50 not bad.  This place was decent for a buffet.  One bad thing was that it was cramped where we were sitting. oh well all in .all it was a good choice"}
{"text":"Meh. It was decent but the main things you pay for in the $15.99 dinner price (ribs, snow crablegs, etc.) are disgusting.   The place is pretty dirty.   Wouldn't recommend it..."}
{"text":"The food has been sitting there for a couple hours and the restrooms are disgusting I don't think they putting them in a couple of days"}
{"text":"It has been a while since my last visit to buffet asia.  The food was reasonably good but the facility itself was horribly dirty.  I am surprised i did not get sick.  For starters, i watched them wash the floor with dishrags then put them on the beverage service bar, then move them onto a chair then the same rag was used to clean a table top.  YIKES!  At the mongolian section, while the cook was cooking my food, out came one of those rags and he was cleaning the grill and the rag touched my food!!!  YIKES.  The walls around the edge of our booth was covered with splatter and a quick look around, splatter and finger prints and dust and just plain dirty.  Like I said, the food was good and i made it through the night, but when you really look around at this place, you would think the health department would shut them down.  I could site many more observations, but i think you get it.  I also think many of the staff are living there.  I got a look in the back of house and i really think they are living in the kitchen.  I dont think I will every return.  Also, very unfriendly staff, maybe they just dont speak English??  Dunno."}
{"text":"At the entrance you have to prepay your food  this cashier was telling us how much we have to pay but we did not understood it so we asked again but she ignored us and then she just pointed us sign!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian buffet in Las Vegas!  I've been to the one on Rainbow as well, but IMHO this one is better.  I've been here for dinner several times, and now I can't bring myself to order crab legs at any other restaurant.  I mean, why pay $$$ for (if you're lucky) a pound of crab legs in a fancy schmancy place when I can gorge myself on fine quality crustacean appendages at Buffet at Asia for less than $20?!  Add a big bowl of melted butter and 18 wetnaps, and I'm a happy girl.  Their other buffet selections are consistently tastey, hot, and quickly re-filled when supplies get low.  Chinese, Dim Sum, Thai, Sushi, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian ... They've got it all covered, and they do it very well.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not too bad of a buffet.   Completely agree with Guy C's comment on the hot and sour soup. it was neither hot nor it was sour. The spicy was from very very finely grounded black pepper and that's about it.   Service is okay in regards to busing plates and refilling drinks. If you need extra forks or napkins it's faster go just grab them yourself.   The food is good but after your first time everything's pretty much the same. Most likely will return but not for a few months"}
{"text":"This place is alright. it gets the job done! However many minor details give this place two stars. Let's start off at the arrival. Plenty of parking and very nice outside. when entering you get very cramped up when it's busy. anyways we were greeted by the front desk, but in a rude manner. Next the waitress at our table began to be rude to me and my family, making it seem like she didn't want to serve us..... so we minded our own business, however the waitress herself started gossiping about us to coworkers and I guarantee you I saw her.   the food is decent and it will get the job done for lunch, but have had better experiences at a Chinese restaurant. idk about dinner. don't try they're egg wonton soup, it's not as good as others. Also, back to customer service they also try to rush you, so take your time. Most of the time they were rude and made this experience bad for me. I'm not sure if I would go back because of the poor and rude service they gave to us. If that doesn't mind you, then go get lunch ! because it's cheaper than dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm actually impressed with how bad this place is. I was warned not to come here and still did.. can not believe they are still in business. This is worst food I've ever eaten. Flavorless junk. I think I might actually get sick just from how the food looks in the bar. Tried several different things, small portions, it's all horrible."}
{"text":"My nephew is 2 years old and he is 3 feet 5 inches tall so the cashier insisted that he has to be charged half of the adult's price.  I found this to be ridiculous because no 2 year old child eats half of what an adult eats!  But their rule is, if you are over 3', you are charged half the adult's price.  The only thing my nephew ate was an ice cream cone!  Everything that I tried was very salty!!  And this is the first buffet that I have been to where they do not give free refill on drinks.  If you're going to do that, at least not make your food so damn salty.  Jeebus!    On top of poo poo food, their service is beyond terrible!  Usually if a place has bad service, the food compensates for it or vice versa but good lord this place lacks both.  I will never ever eat here again."}
{"text":"There's a lot of food, nothing that was too good.  My boyfriend loves it because he eats so much but not much variety in sushi.  Quality was just not that great. Place is not that clean either, there was a bug that crawled on the wall at our table!  My first and last time there."}
{"text":"Came at night time the place is kinda gross to eat at, it a little bit dim-lighted, cramped, too many people, bathroom has mural of alcohol, and etc. I don't like it, but the food were ok."}
{"text":"I'm not huge on buffets... but this particular buffet was ok.    the spread is a little bit of all the choice asian cuisines.  mostly chinese and japanese.  they also offer a dessert/ and fruits section.. as well as a soup section. the sushi was pretty fresh considering its a buffet  servers are there to serve..  not to show their friendly.. so, in this setting it works for me.    it's busy because pricing is fair  and its located on eastern.. a very busy street.  anyway... not the first place on my list.. or the 10th either."}
{"text":"I had to treat my mom out because she wanted noodles. So aside from d buffet, we stopped in this joint. I was greeted at the door, which was a good sign thus far, cleanliness of the place appearing to be good. Service good... negative: the food wasn't held at priper temperatures..can we say foodborne illness?"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for dinner on 12/2/14 and the food itself was very good.  What irked me is the restaurant itself.  The booth seats were not fastened to the floor so when myself or the person behind me got up the whole seat moved.  Also there was dirty dishes on carts just piled up not to far from the food.  And the restrooms..the smell was so bad and unkept that it smelled worse than a rest area.  Will I go back to this one..no.  I do like the one on Rainbow/Sahara."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to the restaurant. Honestly I don't think it was really worth the price for the dinner buffet. I tend to be more on the fiscally responsible side when it comes to restaurants, but I also don't mind paying for good food. I just don't feel this was worth my money. The chicken pieces were tough and soggy. I feel like I could've just gone to panda express for better quality food and paid half the price.   Also, we were seated in the bar area and could smell the bathroom from our booth."}
{"text":"This will be the last time i will eat in this place.we had lunch buffet today and the ambiance that you can smell in the dining area is the dirty restroom that never been cleaned and the lady that was inspecting the food and looking at the customers eating around was more concern how much and what kind of food youre getting that making the place clean and better ambiance for customers while dining.i feel i wanna throw up with the food i ingested with the bad air from the rest room i wonder how this place pass the inspection by the dept of health. Its terrible and never be the place to eat and dine.we paid lunch buffet because when we get there its a late lunch and at 3:45 pm they started to serve dinner my husband triednto get lobster and part of the dinner menu becuse they serve it for dinner the server approach him that he is not allowed to get dinner food unless he has to pay $5'more because thats a dinner. Food this is the only place ive known would embarass customer not to eat food they serve it should be specific in their rules when the customer pay so we know but ive know some buffet places that doesnt care what you eat as long as you pay and that skinny asia lady that watches the customer the amount of food. Customer are getting is like an idiot and she should check their restroom instead rather than watching customer while their eating. Very dirty and bad palce to eat with idiot server"}
{"text":"I felt like I was transported to China. The hygiene & service standard of this restaurant is certainly unexpected of an F & B place in the United States. I was even taken aback by the taste & preparation of Chinese food which was so different from what I've had in Singapore & the U. S. It was bland, salty, & unappetizingly unfresh & poorly presented. We were neither served water nor the drinks we ordered within 15 minutes of our arrival. I had to ask 3 times & walked up to the waitress to remind her. Terrible place to eat at. Won't come back."}
{"text":"The staff and food are not good, save your money! Tables seemed dirty and staff unmotivated. The food is not hot and very limited in choices. We will not be coming back to this restaurant.."}
{"text":"This buffet is the best deal. We have 3 people plus a tip $54. It's a bargain and it's delicious. It's just too many people. The waiter is a bit busy. But it's okay. You can eat it often."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Asian buffets in town! We've tried all the buffet @ asias and this is our favorite. What really makes it stand out though, is they have a girl working here I feel like she goes by Cindy. She's SUPER friendly, attentive, and has even offered to have food made for us that wasn't out on that particular day. We've been here a few times and she's always awesome and definitely deserves the recognition! She's not even a server as far as I know. She's usually up at the front.  I also like this buffet because they offer a little more variety, like they have awesome tempura and Thai soups. The food is always hot and fresh. Definitely the best choice if you're looking for an Asian buffet."}
{"text":"Ugh.... My stomach still hurts from eating here. Then again, what did I expect for an $8.79 buffet? They do have a lot of items but none of it is good at all. I guess the best thing about this place is the Mongolian BBQ station. Please keep in mind that most of the staff here barely speaks any English, and that includes the Mongolian BBQ \"chef\". All he is gonna say is \"Spicy?\" And you should just say yes or no. Don't be like this lady in front of me who told the chef that she wanted the beef medium rare, the chicken well-done, the pork medium, and just a little bit spicy. I guarantee you the chef will be completely ignoring you and will make your stuff the same way as he does with everyone else.  The service however was great. Very attentive and kept my drink filled and my plates removed. I get better service here than I do at most Korean restaurants that I go to.  Plenty of people were enjoying the food, so have at it for yourself. As for me, I can't handle too much of this. May the Divine Dragon 'Sheng Long' have mercy on whomever used the restroom after I did."}
{"text":"Nothing seemed fresh. All the seafood was completely over cooked. Place over all seems dirty."}
{"text":"Where else can you go for a buffet that tastes better than Todai and pay half the price?  Well, go to Buffet @ Asia.  I found out about this place when we were at a friend's house in Henderson.    I feel their selection is just as good, if not better than most buffets.  They have a good selection of food.  Sushi, crab legs, sauteed lobster, mongolian bbq, an assortment of foods from different areas of Asia, and a good dessert bar with a chocolate fountain.  Whenever we go there, we spend hours getting fat.  If you go with me, maybe you can watch the \"Bottomless Pit Experience\" where my friend eats as many plates as he can.  Trust me, you'll love it here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite buffets to go to.  The food is always good, plentiful and varied.  The sushi is fresh and there is usually more than just basic California rolls like most other Asian buffets offer.    The staff is always kind and attentive.  They clear plates quickly and my glass is never more than half empty, and I tend to go through tea pretty quickly.   One last comment, my guy and I decided to start a new Christmas tradition this year since I wasn't feeling well enough to cook a fancy dinner on Christmas eve.  I always thought it would be fun to go for Chinese,  a la The Christmas Story.  This buffet was the first place that popped into my head.  Thankfully they were open, although we arrived about 30 mins before they were set to close so we were prepared to have to stuff our faces pretty quickly.  So not the case!  There were quite a few tables of people still.  They were still bringing out fresh food (even up to the time we left, which was after closing time), the staff was still very attentive and never made us feel rushed.  We still weren't the last ones there when we left to a nice season's greeting from all the staff.  I think we have found our Christmas Eve tradition spot for the foreseeable future!!"}
{"text":"the resturant is filthy. the door window blind has blood all over it..washrooms are gross... food not bad the service sucked.."}
{"text":"Lots of items to choose from - that's the reason to go here, and the food is good, too. The frog legs, if you're interested, are good (yes, they taste like chicken, but they're still good), and all the regular chinese food staples are here. Always crowded if you don't mind and the sign that refers to possibly being 86'd if you waste food is inappropriate and a turn-off, but a good fun place to burst at the seems as you fill up on tasty selections. Fair price; one of the better chinese buffets in the city."}
{"text":"This place is always good!! It's kinda scary when you walk in but it is probably the best Asian food and sushi I have ever had!!! I would totally recommend this place to anyone. It is surprisingly cheap for what you get!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Asian buffet in Las Vegas but a good place to start if you like a little bit of everything. They have a pretty good selection and variety of food. I enjoyed their sauteed crawfish (which were one of the most popular dishes on the buffet line) the best, but they also had items like crab legs and sushi which was a plus. If you aren't much of a seafood person then they also had plenty of other choices to choose from,   BOTTOM LINE:  CONS - Restaurant interior a little runned down and  food is only okay  PROS - Good selection and cheap prices OVERALL: Definitely should stop by if you are super hungry, craving Asian cuisine and don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"I've dined at this buffet a couple times so far. First and foremost, usually when it comes to buffets, in general, don't expect anything extravagant. When you think about it, you're spending a set amount of money to have \"unlimited\" access to average food.  With that being said, this buffet offers a decent selection of food, especially seafood items. I also like how they offer a good selection of fruits in the dessert area. Majority of the items I had here were pretty good. Also, each time I've been here, I've had good customer service. I don't have any major complaints about this place. 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Asian buffets are a guilty pleasure of mine. Cheap, pretty tasty and all you can eat. It can't get much better than that. This place gets pretty busy and they still maintain pretty good service and keep the food stations clean."}
{"text":"Yikes. It says a lot when you walk in to an empty dining room at dinner time. The price is $15 with a drink for AYCE buffet. The food is mostly mushy and old. Since there weren't many diners, they weren't really making anything fresh. I did have have some sushi, some of it looked questionable but the pieces I did try were okay. They do use imitation crab tho. Nothing is labeled so I have no idea what I am eating, which irks me. Cream cheese wontons were cold and had a smidgen of cream cheese in them. I had the hot and sour soup, which had a weird aftertaste. I love crab legs, which they only serve at dinner time, but these were so skinny and small, I could hardly get any meat out of them. I ended up giving up after I had a slimy, mushy mess on the plate in front of me. Our server was kind and attentive, and refilled our drinks frequently. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This buffet has filipino beef steak and ox tail soup, but they need more ox tail in it! Sesame mochi balls were on hit when they are fresh from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch whenever I visit the strip. The food is average but the Mongolian grill is awesome. They also have a really big variety of sushi rolls. Most importantly, the service is excellent and everyone is friendly. They are always busy and crowded so I would come either early around 11 or late around 1."}
{"text":"The staff was very rude and disrespectful.  This is the first and last time I will ever come to this restaurant.  My party and I  returned to the table with are dessert, are table was given to someone else. That was very unprofessional, I have never been treated in that manner before. What a disappointment"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my boyfriend today. It was around 10 each, not bad pricing at all compared to other buffets I've been to. A decent selection of food and sushi. I took a star off because food could have been warmer and there was no crab legs. I added a star back because there was the station where they had raw meat/vegetables and they cook it right there for you. Drinks stay filled which I'm happy with because that place was packed. Decent place and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"If you can ignore the mouse trap in the women's restroom, this place is pretty decent haha. My friends and I were on a Chinese bus tour and we stopped here before heading back to California. The lunch buffet was 12 bucks and food was tasty. My favorites were the eggplant tofu, bok choy, Jin dui sesame red bean ball and the wonton with cheese on it."}
{"text":"This was the nastiest restaurants I have ever been in. I can't for the life of me, figure out why the health department hasn't closed it down.   My husband and I wanted Chinese food, saw this place and decided to try it. We were seated and then went up to the buffet and retrieved our plates. I noticed something felt greasy under my plate and turned it over. It was filthy, absolutely no exaggeration. I grabbed my husband and had him flip his plate over, again the same filth. I took the plates back to the pile we got them from and set them aside. Picked up another couple plates and turned them over, disgusting! I set those aside and started going through the pile. Every plate i picked up was greasy and had food residue on it.  At this time, I decided to talk to the people at the front counter. I showed them the plates and told them the whole stack was dirty. They told us to try another stack of plates so we did. The very same grease and crud was on those plates. In the meantime, the woman took the plates into what I assume was the kitchen. She emerged telling us it was taken care of. I told her I couldn't find any clean plates so she disappeared into the kitchen again. Out she comes with a stack of styrofoam plates, seriously. She put them by a stack of dishes and I grabbed a couple.   We put a varied assortment of food on our styrofoam plates and headed back to our table. I started to eat only to find the food lukewarm. Got up, went and grabbed another plate and dished up some other items of food and returned to my seat. Oh swell the same lukewarm temperature.  In the meantime, I see a guy from the kitchen come out with stacks of plates on a cart. He stops at the first stack of plates and piles the fresh plates onto the dirty ones. Goes to another stack and does the same thing. Out of curiosity I go and get a fresh plate off the first pile he stacked. The plate was filthy! Picked up a few more and the same thing, grease and food residue. So, I decided to check the warmth of the food in all the tables by hovering my hand over the food to see if I could feel any heat. Barely felt anything. This was not near closing, this was at dinner time. I wanted to scream at the other people eating there to check the underside of their plates and ask if they noticed that their food was not hot as required by law, but I didn't.  So, the next time you go there, check every plate you use and don't eat food that is lukewarm as it could make you very sick or kill you!  By the way, Chinese are notoriously cheap. That would explain the dirty dishes, not using sufficiently hot water and changing the water in the rinse tank. As for the warmth of the food, it costs money to raise the temperature in the steam tables as it consumes more gas and that costs money.   Diner Beware!"}
{"text":"FILTHY,DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY DONT EAT HERE!! The longer we were here the worse our experience got.  I was charged wrong walking in.I had two adults,one child and Two toddlers but she charged for Three adults and One child. And they wouldn't fix it when I brought it to their attention and took my receipt after getting our drinks.  Some foods were not hot and dishes being brought out for restock were dirty and had prior guests food still stuck to them. We watched employees clean condiment holders less then two feet from our table inside a busser tub \"Dirty dish bins\" ON THE FLOOR and Not once did they change the water NOT EVEN to rinse them then almost mediately put them back on tables where customers were eating. Employees were wiping down utensil areas and child high chairs with the same rags then getting refills without washing their hands.   DIRTY ENVIRONMENT  I tried to bring it to the managers attention who was the women at the register and she completely disregarded what I was saying to her as if I was lying about it.  I told her I would be sharing our experience and she brushed me off and said go ahead so YELP here is my experience."}
{"text":"I love their seafood delight. So yummy! Go around lunch time. The prices during dinner is outrageous. (15 bucks plus drink) It's about the same price as the casinos and less variety!"}
{"text":"Place is good! No complaints for me. Has a good selection of food choices and service is not that bad."}
{"text":"This place not to bad! Good food and has a mongolian style station! Which is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed..mi know its a Chinese buffet so you shouldn't expect much of anything whether it be food quality or service, but  I guess I expected a little too much. The food was warm, crab legs were not fresh and very very skinny. I don't even know why they even  bother. Service was ok. But as we were leaving  there was a very upset customer complaining about a server and how rude she was. i left the place  still feeling very hungry. By te time I got home my stomach was hurting. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food wasn't a problem. It was more the young front desk lady who has a problem. First we called five minutes before arriving to see how much w meal was, the guy told us $7.99..then when we came inside to pay our total came out to be$20 with some change. That didn't bother me..but when I asked, \"I thought it was $7.99? A guy told us on the phone\" she was rude and cut me off the whole time. When I paid she snatched my card and receipt. Nothing's more bad than ad customer service."}
{"text":"This was the worst Asian buffet I have ever experienced. It was pricey and you had to pay before you could enter. The food was unappetizing and cold. The restaurant was dirty and the restrooms were filthy."}
{"text":"I've been to buffet Asia before, the one on rainbow, and it is my favorite. This one not so much. The staff is nice, but the food has no taste, not to mention the place itself. I've never seen a place so dirty before. Like I said I love buffet Asia, but the food in this one is not good at all."}
{"text":"I only come here to eat the jalapeño chicken wings. I eat a dozen or so and that basically it. For the price it's pretty cheap. It's a old restaurant, it could use some updating. It's always packed."}
{"text":"Food was bland and the host was impolite. I didn't like the smell when you entered the restaurant. The rice was cold and the decor was something like a toy story movie, they also didn't all work. The buffet area was unkept and serving spoons got mixed, which is probably a sign of unsanitary."}
{"text":"Just remember we're talking Chinese buffets here.... That having been said, I don't know of any better in town having been to 5-6 throughout the years - especially for the price of $10 for lunch. Decent variety with all your standards and the Mongolian grill is always open if you want something super fresh. It's always pretty busy which means everything stays relatively fresh. This isn't the Baccahanal Buffet at Caesars but definitely my go to place if I'm having a hankering for a plate full of Americanized Chinese food."}
{"text":"This use to be one of the best placed to eat. I use to love their food, but this was 5-6 years ago, my Dad loved coming here. I went back yesterday with my Mom and my best friend, and it was absolutely disgusting. So dirty, the workers are so rude. There was a couple across from us who barley had gotten their and they got up to get their second plate and the lady told her 'Have a great night, bye.' The couple just looked at her and said they were going to get more food.  Not only that, but my best friend got the dirtiest cup ever with filthy water. When I told her worker she gave me a snotty look. didn't even apologize and snatched the water came back and with her nasty attitude put it back on the table, and to be honest the food isn't even that good. I'd rather eat at Panda."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, if you're looking for top-tier Chinese food options, go to the Strip and head to the casino buffets.  If you just want to get stuffed for cheap, this is your spot!  It's relatively cheap, especially at lunch time.  Nothing here specifically stands out as it's more or less typical Chinese/Japanese fare.  The good thing is that because there's such high turnover of food, you're usually getting some pretty fresh vegetables.  There's also a Mongolian BBQ option if you want it, although it's pretty meh compared to a dedicated Mongolian BBQ place.    If you like Asian good and you're trying to eat way too much in one day to cover your meals for the entire day (like ME), then this is where to go!  Don't expect much more than that though."}
{"text":"We were visiting in Vegas and a friend told us to try this restaurant.  We were happy with the service and the food.  The lobster, frog legs a sushi was delicious.  You will not be disappointed.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"It's Mothers Day and I am here with my only 2 children. I expected a relaxed time and peaceful energy. Instead, we were called only to walk around and be told they didn't have a booth big enough for our family. We were told to wait once again in the lobby until they had room for us. I get it, it's a very special Day and business is booming for them. This is when it went sour. I went back to the hostess at the entry and showed her my receipt (has a number on the corner-that's how they call you), and I told her if she could call us when there was a bigger booth ready. She looked at faintly and said \"yeah yeah I know I'll call you.\" Then I asked her if she needed my receipt number and she sd again \"no I already know another hostess told me already ok!\" No customer service, no eye contact, no pleasant voive, rather attitude  and a \"I'm already overwhelmed face!\" You knew you were gonna be busy right, whay did you expect a slow day?! It ruined my vibe and I couldn't help but tell her \"ok thank you for your positive attitude!\" We and you don't deserve service like this when you're paying for it, and especially on a special day! I'M so appaled."}
{"text":"Typical asian buffet. Nothing too special. Desserts aren't that good."}
{"text":"This buffet spot is definitely a hidden gem when you come to Vegas. It is a bit off the strip but well worth a drive thru Chinatown to get to this place. If you want a small escape from the high prices that you generally find at any last Vegas buffet, this buffet eatery is just for you. The food is pretty decent, the selection is off the charts and they got snow crab, craw fish and oysters on deck (if you are eating for dinner). $18 bucks per person for quality seafood and a frozen yogurt cone you could bring home with you? Yuup."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. One of the better Asian buffet places I have been to. For 17 dollars,  I had sushi, sashimi, frozen yogurt, lobster, Chinese food, Asian soups, and a nice selection of cakes and cookies.  The quality of the food was really good.  I did not find any items that were bad. Everything was either good or OK.  The buffet tables were well maintained. If something ran out, they would replace it very fast.  I think this place is better than any buffet place I have been to in San Francisco.  I am impressed by this place. I would not mind going to this place again. Also, this  place has a Mongolian / Korean BBQ option that is included in the price."}
{"text":"This place is the best for takeout. You can get a Styrofoam container full of Chinese food and a miso soup bowl for the buffet price, and that's much more than I could eat while I'm there.  They keep the sushi well stocked and fresh, so I load up on that. It's better than store sushi, but not as good as Makino. There are sesame balls with red bean paste that are super yummy too. The green beans are also a hit.   There's another reason I prefer takeout. The dining area is kind of, well, low budget. 10 steps below a diner would be a good description. They really need a makeover."}
{"text":"Food is ok for the price that you pay... I saw hardened food on plates that just came out from the dishwasher and a cockroach on the floor. I felt rushed by the bussers."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would! More then half of the \"hot\" items on the stream tables were luke warm to cold, including shellfish. The items needn't to be served cold looked to have been sitting there for a VERY long time. The bathroom was disguisting! The beige tile floors were mostly black, the counter was covered in water, there was hair in the sink, and the trash was overflowing. Don't even bother!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Asian buffet in town, not any more!  We were there last week and we can't believe we've been eating there as long as we have.  The place was absolutely filthy, don't even go in the men's room!  The ladies room isn't quite as bad.  The place is run down and looks like a soup kitchen.  There are beggars out front peddling garbage or begging for money.  Passing over most of the food which just looked like slop I settled on cold shrimp by the \"salad\" portion of the counters.  I was going to have a salad but the lettuce was wilted and didn't look good.  The sushi looked okay so I chose a CA roll then a bowl of wonton soup which was quite tasty.  I had a couple bites from my son's plate and wasn't impressed.  My brother ended up in the men's room tossing his cookies after taking a couple bites of something he had grilled.  I didn't personally see any CR's but I'm sure they are around.  The employees seemed like zombies.  It was just \"all about collecting your money\" to them.  We couldn't get refills or dirty plates cleared.  I tried to ask one employee a question about the ice cream machine and they looked past me and kept on going.  Tried to get a small cone and stood there for 3 minutes for one inch stream.  I think it was empty and nobody cared.  I tasted the chocolate that seemed to be coming out ok but OMG it was horrible.  If that was chocolate, I'm never eating it again.  Price at lunch is almost $10.00 and for dinner (after 3:30 pm) it is about $13.99.  Way over priced for such a dump with nasty food.  If you find yourself here, I recommend the fresh fruits.  I hope these are okay because I did enjoy those."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most disgusting place I have ever walked into. The entry way was filthy. The service upon arriving was horrible. The floor is covered in fifth, because apparently the staff does nothing here. The food is unmarked so we didn't know what anything was. I can't say much to the taste of anything because the appearance was enough for me. We asked for a refund and left immediately! I will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times before for family gatherings; food was decent, but there were a lot of choices. However, the service was alright until today.  We had a party of nine people, and I expected all of us to be seated at the same table. However, they told us our only option was to be seated in two separate tables. The hostess was very rude, telling us that if we don't like the seating arrangement, \"then leave.\"  Fortunately, a waitress, CiCi came to us and apologized on behalf of the staff. She asked us if we would like to wait until an open seat was available and was able to accomodate us.  We enjoyed our lunch, but we are not going to continue going here if we are being treated rudely before we are seated."}
{"text":"I got dragged out here, while in the area for work, with a co-worker that really loves buffets, especially the Chinese ones. I had eaten at the Buffet At Asia at Eastern/215 a few years back and thought it was meh, so because of that I wasn't too thrilled when we decided to come here.  It turns out that this location wasn't too bad, depending on what you ate, but the majority looked decent and safe to eat. They had a soup, hot foods, sushi and Mongolian BBQ section. The sushi was surprisingly good and when I ran out of stuff to eat, I opted for the Mongolian BBQ where you select the veggies, meats and sauces you want and have them stir fry it for you. Weekday lunch was about 10 bucks including tax.  The dining area, however, was super crowded and old looking. There were a bunch of fatties and weird looking people but I'm sure that's common just because of the side of town we were on. When I first walked in I immediately noticed that I was the only Asian customer which made me think the food was going to be terrible so I was definitely glad that it turned out being ok.  I have definitely been to better Chinese buffets, and for sure cleaner and newer looking ones but since none of those are in Vegas, I guess this place will do if you're in the mood for a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Nice buffet with low price of 15 buck dinner pricing. if you sick paying over 30$ per person at hotel buffet. Food was nice and enjoyable. Down side is just crowded. It was well worth to get in a car and drive 15 off the strip. It has sashimi, rolls, sushi, all others with crap legs. Definitely recommend and will revisit again whenever I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been. Food is okay, but the restroom is very disgusting. They are also using disposable tableware, which feels extremely cheap. At this price, you can definitely go to a better place."}
{"text":"its a ok place.. not too expensive but some of the dishes are quite good others are just ok. parking is horrible."}
{"text":"Food was decent though not the greatest selection. it ended up not being worth the $14.99 we paid but we had fun. Also cool that there was thai food offered. trans-friendly: B+ i think you might get static from any of the trashy people who seem to be in every chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere. Food is absolutely nasty. Dirty unprofessional nasty"}
{"text":"Variety was great and food was very fresh and flavorful. You definitely can't beat the price! I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Popular buffet in the burbs focusing on various asian cuisines, including, Japanese, Thai, Korean and Chinese. The quality of the food is just OK, as you'd for these lower end buffets. This is certainly no Todai. The overall quality is influenced greatly by how long the food has been sitting under the heat lamps. The first plate of Pad Thai was pretty good, while a later plate was pretty lackluster.  While my dad loves the Korean beef that is cooked by a chef, I like the  garlic string beans best. There at least a half dozen different chicken dishes, in all different styles. I didn't care for the lemon chicken, while the others were decent.  My mom said the fish balls weren't too good. The sushi are unremarkable.  They have yellow watermelon which is good. I like the almond jello too. I'd avoid the perennial chocolate fountain.  Service is average. Sunset station is much better at picking up the finished plates promptly. Here they are about average.  $6.99 lunch includes hot tea, but not sodas. Good value. Get there early as there's a wait once you hit 12:30 or so."}
{"text":"nasty nasty nasty? found. ticks in food!!! never ever ever again & owner did not refund money??????  horrible selection as well never been to a worse asian buffet in my life!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not the best. It looked really good from the outside and really satisfying, but you go inside and the service is horrible. They are not only hastily and rude, but actually their prices are not what they should be. You can find cheap Asian food buffet in other places for way cheaper. So i really wouldn't recommend this place. I mean we wanted a cheap and good experience than the expensive restaurants in Vegas. But we definitely decided that this stuff ain't worth. Spend the big bucks, you're in Vegas already."}
{"text":"Did Lady Luck rob you blind? Perhaps the dealer had gotten a 21 one time too many and now you're completely broke but still want to eat your sadness away? Well look no further than Buffet @ Asia. Who can drop that much money Bacchanal Buffet anyways? For as little as $15 (that said I didn't get too good of a look at the prices if you know what I mean), you can gorge yourself alongside others determined to commit gluttony. Score yourself a 15% coupon and you even get to save some more! Maybe that $30 that you saved can lead to a jackpot! Just be aware, this is a Chinese buffet, as in don't expect the best.  Like most Chinese buffets at dinner time, the place was loaded with seafood. Most importantly, they had dim sum style lobster! For $15, you're getting all you can eat lobster. Am I dreaming and living the buffet life or what? Throw in salmon sashimi, crab legs, frog legs, and dynamite and it's a home run! Unfortunately, I must admit that the food is obviously not of the best quality. The clams were sandy and had a weird, somewhat metallic taste. The oysters weren't very fresh and weren't cleaned properly. The nigiri had obviously been sitting out for a long time and should have been disposed of. At the beginning of service, the salmon sashimi was very very good. Then, it became horrible cuts and believe it or not, I found a piece of bone in a piece. Yuck! The shrimp dynamite was deliciously cheesy and creamy but none of the shrimp were deveined. I don't know about anything else I found that the taste of the food in general was strong; it's heavily seasoned.   Now, onto service. Holy moly! My table literally never had an empty plate at any time. There were times they carted my plate away while I still had food on it that I was getting to! And yes, most of the time, the item about to be taken away were lobsters and crab legs. My water was constantly being filled to the very blink. They were probably hoping that I'd get full off the water.   Overall, for $15, this place is a steal. It's a bit messy but this is a Chinese buffet boy! You do't come here for world class service; you come here for food at dirt cheap prices."}
{"text":"Oh dear, everything was just off about this place. The food was off, everything tasted old and not very good at all. Even the fruits were not so appealing. It was horrible! Blaaaaaah, I wouldn't want to come back. Pretty cheap though..."}
{"text":"Trust these reviews omg when I was a yung weedhead this was my go to munchie place about 7-8 years ago...I went there today and literally finished half a plate...disgusting,bland,greasy,and looking at the dirt dust food compacted on the walls right next to me just did it for me omg this place has lost it. I tried to be discrete in the pictures I took so I hope u can see this dirt is about a foot away from us and my plate which I couldn't even finish I know it was only $26 for us but it was definitely wasted. I give two stars for my unseeet tea,they were nice,and we got right in and honestly,I feel bad because this has been a Henderson staple for years WHAT HAPPENED"}
{"text":"Once upon a time it was really good, but the food seems too oily for me.   I do really like the salt & pepper crab legs, but you must go there early to make sure they don't run out.   Great price but you get full very fast...."}
{"text":"The food taste is ok, im come here in lunch time . I give one star is about the service kind of rude and they using disposable plates ,forks and spoon also cup too . I know the price is very cheap in this area (Las Vegas) just $13 including tips but i don't know the real price must be more cheap. I come with tour"}
{"text":"The crab legs were very thin. Hardly any meat. The sushi and sugar doughnuts were pretty good but not worth going there just for that. It was way too crowded and the bathrooms were gross! I immediately got food poisoning after my first plate and I'm still sick two days later. Do NOT go here! It's very unsanitary!"}
{"text":"Been there once, the food is ok, lots options to choose from but I wish the place was cleaner, I could smell the restroom while eating :(  Tip: get a table as far as you can from the restroom or choose other place to eat at"}
{"text":"Food is really good and fresh and sushis are amazing! Love the ambiance as well. One thing though, their servers need to smile more. Because that's how you get good tips is by your customer service."}
{"text":"One star doesn't do justice for this grimy place! My boyfriend and I decided to try it out since we haven't been in many many years...Well, what a horrible mistake!! As soon as we entered the so called restaurant that smells like wet dog the lady at the front was immediately distasteful and pushy. Once seated, we waited awhile for someone to greet us and take our drink order so we could get food. Finally some guy casually walks out from the kitchen and greets us!  We get up and start with the Sushi Bar...Just by looking at it you could already taste the stale, dried out rolls! There was sticky notes that said \"For Dinner Only\" on some roles! Assuming they were left out since lunch time! Gross AF!   We both got a couple that looked decent and kept going down the line thinking it would get better... Salad bar next.... WHAT salad bar?!?! There were two shrubs of lettuce and that was it. I didn't even bother.... Soups looked nasty and probably hadn't been changed since December of last year!   I don't know how anyone could consume this food!   We finally sit down and pick at the few things on our plates... my boyfriends eyes grew huge when chewing on the orange chicken, he said  tasted like rubber! We both tried a sushi roll and nearly spit it out, edamame was frozen, noodles were stale, long story short everything was garbage!! ( After we left we felt sick to our stomachs with the little amount we ate )  We have never been the kind of rude people to make a scene and walk out...So we politely told our waiter we were going to leave and my boyfriend was generous enough to pay for one meal! They were so rude when we were leaving and obviously talking shit in Chinese! They didn't deserve any money !    I'm sure we are not the only ones who have been so disgusted and left!! Please don't give this restaurant your business! It needs to be shut down!"}
{"text":"This is another highly requested place when friends or family come to visit. Cheap, good for large groups, and always good  service. Come here on an empty stomach because there's a lot of food there's Mongolian, crab legs, oyster, a pretty good sushi selections, sashimi, tempura veggies, and the regular Chinese buffet food, for under $20. They also make steaks made to order, frog legs, Thai tea.  There's not a lot of selection for desserts but who's there for that. There's a lot of space but always gets busy so don't mine if you might have to wait a bit, or just call in advance especially with larger groups."}
{"text":"Buffet Asia on east Flamingo is fantastic! The food is fresh, changed for dinner and the service is excellent! Always busy, but moves quickly! Joyce"}
{"text":"I got sick. You get what you pay for. Not fresh food... an especially bad thing when you offer sushi, oysters and fish on your menu. Worst customer service I have experienced in many, many years."}
{"text":"It was eh.. but I wouldn't recommend the sushi, it doesn't look very fresh. Some specific spots were very slippery..(didn't have the warning signs). The service was okay.. not great but just ok"}
{"text":"well... you can never be satisfied after you leave a buffet but over all buffet asia is really worth it. def go there for dinners because its only 4 bucks extra but you get so much more stuff such as 2 types of crab legs, better shrimps and oysters, steaks , sushi and sashimi and much more. i would never go there again for lunch....never again. its also a place you can go alone and you wouldnt feel weird."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite buffets in town! When my out of town friends visit, they love to eat here too. I'm from the east coast where the chinese buffets are usually very salty or greasy or soggy, but this place keeps pumping out fresh tasty food consistently, even until 9pm when the doors close and customers are still waiting to get in. The staff is always nice.  Lunch is a steal and dinner is definitely worth the extra seafood. On weekends (fri-sun), dinner includes raw oysters, 2 types of crab, and lobster. Among my favorite dishes are the clams (the sauce is sooo good over rice!), frog's legs (kinda like fishy chicken wings), fried rangoons, lobster, lettuce wraps, and chinese donuts. They even have plantains, kalbi (at the mongolian grill), pad thai, chicken katsu, and sushi. Skip the sushi unless you're desperate (go to Wonder Sushi near the District).  The dessert selection is small but sweet: almond cookies, sesame toasted nuts, chocolate and vanilla ice cream, cakes, and fruits that can be dunked in the chocolate fountain. Once in a while they have lychees.  They raised their prices in the last few years, but now soft drinks are included in the price, still making this place definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a little different from the one on Sahara & Rainbow (I'm a regular there, it's closer to my house), but still just as good. They have edamame in the salad section and a really really (really!!) spicy thai soup. I dare you to eat a whole bowl. This restaurant has a much nicer ambience and I'd go more often if it wasn't so far away. Service is always nice."}
{"text":"Worth coming here if you visiting Vegas around the strip. Its only 6miles away and most locals come here for buffetts that costs half of what the strip buffetts charges you. Some foods have better quality, some dont, compared to the strip..but at the end , the price and the variety of menus are way much better than the strip. Will be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times in the last few weeks, for the price you get a real good selection. I'm going to go there again in a couple days."}
{"text":"My family and I have came here a few times and went yesterday. It was probably one of the worst experiences weve ever had here. Our hostess was so rude! She was going to sit us in one of those little rooms they have (I dont know what theyre called) but it was pretty cold in there so my mom said, \"Its too cold in here.\" The lady scoffs and literally said, \"Ughhhhh.\" Like she seemed so annoyed to have to move us somewhere else. I dont care how bad of a day youve had, its definitely not the customers fault that youre just over work and just want to go home. Anyways, our waitress was another story! My mom ordered a hot tea. Mind you, my mom is a waitress so she knows QUALITY service. The waitress just gave her her tea, didnt ask if shed like sugar,  honey, anything really. My mom had to grab some sugar from another table. Long story short, the waitress only came back to pick up the plates but never asked if we needed anything else or how we were doing. Just really bad service. I don't know if its because it was a saturday or what but from now on I might come for the food once in a while because im definitely NOT coming back for the service!"}
{"text":"So I've been to this asian AYCE spot a few times and have been pretty satisfied with their selections.  The price is very affordable at about $7.79 for lunch, dinner is $11.99 Mon-Thur, $14.99 Fri-Sun, and drinks are $1.29.  The food selections include sushi rolls, fried frog legs, different types of chicken, cook to order stir fry (which I have yet to try), mussels, pad thai, fried rice, tenderloin with onions, pizza, soups, fruits, and a lot more. I would say dinner is the best time to go due to the various types of seafood that's offered.  Just make sure to hit up the lobster once you see it cause that goes quick.  Oh, I forgot to mention that if you don't feel like eating here you can take to go and pack your own food.  The price will be the same as dine in, though.    The customer service wasn't up to par.  They would forget some of our drinks and not refill them at times.  Other times we'd have to get their attention.  Otherwise, this place isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Frankly, I don't understand why this place has such a low score.  If you want to eat a lot of good and tasty food with good variety in dishes - this is where you can go.  No point to except some fancy service and interior.  This place has a lot of good food and deserts, and that's the main thing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. Although not a buffet on the Strip, this place is definitely one of the most crowded buffets I've been to in Vegas. It's very popular with the locals and visitors.  They have plenty of food and it never runs out despite the continuous stream of folks coming here. The employees are continuosly filling up the trays and so there is always hot food served.  A lot of the Asian buffets seem to always have the same types of food but Buffet at Asia goes beyond your typical Asian buffet food. They have so much more. There are all kinds of food. They have Thai food (pad thai), Chinese food (general chicken, brocolli beef, fried rice, chow mein, spicy chicken, egg flower soup, hot and sour soup, dumplings, egg rolls), Hawaiian food (oxtail soup), American food (french fries, crab, lobster tail, chicken wings), French food (frog legs) and all kinds of dessert (mango pudding with dates, coconut pudding, frozen yogurt, almond cookies, sesame balls, Chinese donuts, fruit cocktail, cream puffs). The crabs seemed to be the fan favorite for most. I noticed people's plates were piled with this.   For the soups, I really liked the wonton soup. The wontons inside were meaty and hearty. For the desserts, I was a fan of their Chinese donuts. They kept bringing these out and so they were always warm and soft. The mango pudding was very flavorful as well. I even was a fan of their frozen yogurt because it had a nice, fine texture and was not runny or milky.  Aside from your typical soda drinks, Buffet at Asia also offers different kinds of drinks like fruit slushes with boba and ice coffee.  Dinner at Buffet at Asia is $14.99. It's a great and yummy deal!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Vegas!  My friend who is a frequent flyer took us there for lunch recently.  Even for lunch, there was so much variety ranging from Mongolian BBQ, BBQ beef ribs, sushi to the usual Asian stuff.  All the TASTY choices plus soft drink (included) for about $10.  To those Yelpers who are griping about cleaniness...  who cares.  It's just cosmetics.  As long as no one gets sick, it's ALL good.  By the way, everyone in my party did just fine post meal."}
{"text":"Dinner special! I love seafood. They all you can eat crab legs for a very cheap price!"}
{"text":"FAKE  BILLS!!!! I come here every now and then because my dad loves this place, other than that I'll pass! But I know for sure my dad isn't coming here anymore! They gave us a fraudulent $20 bill!"}
{"text":"During numerous trips to Vegas, I've frequented the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow Blvd. (My review of that place here: (http://www.yelp.com/biz/buffet-at-asia-las-vegas-4#hrid:mSPf88mhq76t49Qo-3jtlw). In the sea of Vegas buffets, Buffet at Asia is one of the best ones in my opinion for Asian food. On my latest Vegas trip however, I got to try for the first time to the Buffet at Asia in the Henderson area.  The setup of this Buffet at Asia is a little bit different from the one on the westside. This one has one long row of food items that starts with a Mongolian wok type cookery. Next up is their sushi items and then this is followed by the soups: wonton, miso and seafood soup. Up next is the traditional Asian buffet food: they have good offerings like egg rolls, egg foo young, orange chicken, chicken skewers, dumplings and veggie tempura. Off to the side is their desserts: some items are orange jello, almond jello, chocolate mousse, frozen yogurt and sesame balls. I like how above the food items are big, bright lights and letters showing the name of the different areas. So very Vegas picturesque ;)  They do offer some food that the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow doesn't have. It was the first time I saw these chicken with cheese wontons that I really liked. I did think however that the selection over at the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow is larger. This branch at Henderson had good food offerings but not as many as the westside location. Nevertheless, the food here is a good and if in you are in Henderson, it's a good place to go to. It's less than $10 and includes a drink!"}
{"text":"So... I normally have nothing but good things to say about this place, but this time was different.  I understand that I showed at 8:30pm, 30 minutes prior to closing, but that's no excuse. Most of the items were starting to stick to their pans they were in, and were looking dry. Mind you, just a quick stir, and some of the items were somewhat edible. Except for the Orange Chicken. I love Orange Chicken, usually. This OC was covered with onions. COVERED. I pushed the onions to the side, and got some of the chicken. I couldn't even eat it because all I tasted was the onions.  The service was okay. The waiter was right on top of the drinks, but failed to understand that I did not want anymore soda, and that I wanted water instead. All in all, I'd rather go to the one on Rainbow and Sahara. That one has always been amazing."}
{"text":"It used to be better, the crab legs were cold and the clanking dishes were enough to drive you to drink. Also the ladies restroom was filthy and needs remodeling. They should be able to afford it as they get a lot of business. This shrimp dish with pea pods didn't have the sauce it did before so that was a disappointment as well."}
{"text":"I go with friends often for their oyster, sushi and crab but this place getting worse, crab really salty lately, when those trays are empty they take time to refill them and when you take oysters they watching you with sad angry face and make comments in Chinese ... I am not going back there and i don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very poor selection and the selection is decent nothing worth wild. Secondly the customer service very bad no one speaks English. And lastly make sure you check how much they charge you because we got there during lunch time but they charged us dinner and when we let them know what was going on they said it was because dinner food was placed out already but we where clearly there prior to their lunch cut off at 3:45 and they said we could either stay or leave they did not want to negotiate or try to make it right. Just skip it it's not worth the money!!"}
{"text":"I think the food is great here and the price is even better I like that they have sushi and a rule wide variety of food to choose from !"}
{"text":"I have always solicited the Rainbow/Sahara Buffet @ Asia and only read a couple yelp reviews on the Eastern Location and after actually going there I can say \"I get it\" = its an aesthetic thing. The Rainbow/Sahara location is newer & cleaner looking whereas the Eastern location has a bit worn & used look to it.(restroom at Rainbow = No Graffiti & Restroom at Eastern = Graffiti) As far as the food goes the Eastern location had 2 Lunch items that the Rainbow location does not have = Iced peel & eat shrimp & Beef ribs. Also the Eastern location adds a drink onto the price and the Rainbow location asks you what you want to drink before hand and charges you accordingly. Other than that there was not much of a difference I could see in the food being offered and the quality was the same. If I was going to take someone from out of town out to eat I would choose the rainbow location, But just for myself & friends just kicking it, the Eastern location would be just fine."}
{"text":"We have a NEW Champion!!  This place was recommended for its sushi by a bus driver that I have come to know and HE NAILED IT!! A good sign I was in the right place was the amount of local Asians eating there.  After eating Cali Rolls for months on end and NOT eating any for 2 months or so, I was \"Jonesing\" for a fix and this place fixed me up good. They had a wide variety of rolls including spicy tuna, shrimp, eel, as well as rolls wt the orange fish eggs & various rolls wt spicy sauce. All were fresh and very good. The wasabi was kicking as well.   Other stations offered your basic chinese fare such as brocoli & beef, whole fried shrimp, baked mussels wt cheese, Lo Mein, Fried Rice, sauted green beans, spring rolls etc.  There was also a station wt a chef to cook items to order & Tempura broccoli, sweet potatoes etc. And the price was right = $7.56 total. The desert offerings seemed kind of pedestrian & I grabbed a little muffin of some sort to eat on my walk afterwards & it was pretty good.  The location for me is kind of \"off the beaten path\" but well worth a return trip and #1 as far as all the buffets I have been to yet for the variety that included sushi.  I highly recommend it for Lunch."}
{"text":"This Buffet Asia is the second one in Las Vegas. They have a good selection of seafood. The sushi selection and calamari are better than the other location. I would've given it 5 stars if not for their disgusting bathroom that looked like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks."}
{"text":"This is a typical Chinese buffet with Sunday crab, clams, shrimp, fish.  There are sushi options like tamago, eel. This is typical of large pans pre made food. Service was so bad that we had to repeatedly ask for water, clearing our plates, and refills."}
{"text":"This buffet has gone up in price and down in quality. The food was horrible and there was barely anything to choose from. The place is dirty and we even found a hair in the food."}
{"text":"This is the most uncomfortable and not convenient Asian buffet restaurant to eat first of all the ambiance is hot and the customer service was not good enough second the restrooms are so unpleasant smell and the beverages area is dirty...... this is not recommended to eat."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional but service was very rude. Got there at 8:15pm (they close at 9) and they told us that they were not brining out any new food. We decided to eat there anyway. Come to our surprise, they brought so much new, fresh food! The food was not amazing but good for the price.  Right when it hit 9pm on the dot, they waiters and waitresses told us we had to leave since they were closed (we were already on out dessert so we were gonna be there for like 10 more mins). As we tried finishing our last bites of our dessert, the waitress and waiters hovered over us. I saw that they did this to everyone in the restaurant once it hit 9. They hovered over every table (playing with their cell phones, glaring at guests and having private conversations over guests) because they wanted everyone to get out. Never got kicked out of a restaurant before and this made me feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Food is good wide variety and cleaner than it has been in the past .  Very money hungry party of 6 adults and two children makes you pay 15% tip for. Buffet and than the sign says three and under free but if you have a tall three year old then you pay full price not good service sat us at dirty table an quickly just put dirty dishes on another table quick wipe and threw  a handful of napkin and straws down and turn and walked away.  The server did keep our drinks full but was slow removing plates guess that's why they make you tip but don't even know if the server gets it"}
{"text":"Have not been there in 2 years and now I know why..it has to be the absolute worst Chinese buffet I've ever been to. It is so dirty you look up at the lights and it's coated with dust and they are there hanging over your head.The salt and pepper shakers look like they have not been emptied in years there's food inside them . Be careful.really disgusting"}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre.  Over priced for the quality received. Next time I will order take out from a Chinese restaurant that has better quality. Id end up paying the same but have food I enjoy and leftovers for days."}
{"text":"Good selection of different items, quality food. Friendly staff. Decent prices!"}
{"text":"Wish I liked it here more, but the food is usually a little cold, and can seem like it sat out for too long. It is also a bit of a hassle to try and get your drinks refilled."}
{"text":"Not bad, price is right. One of the best China buffets in town. This place is always full in the afternoon on Sunday. But the lines move quick."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! I don't know what sucks more: their non existent service or their food.   The food:  Let's start off with the best thing there: honeydew. I should have just ate honeydew the whole time because everything else sucked. Don't even bother getting their sushi....it's just California roll with sauce on top or presented differently. Their seafood soup or whatever tasted very fishy. The pineapples looked like they had been sitting out for too long. Idk the food was just a huge mess. I felt like I only ate their veggie tempura, baked sweet potato and honey dew the whole time because everything else sucked. And as for the veggie tempura, it wasn't even good, but it was one of the better food options. Thank god they didn't fail on baking the sweet potato or else idk how and why they are still open.   The service:   We asked for napkins like literally 5 times and the waitresses had attitude. We also asked for hot tea and they put the hot tea in a plastic cup. Wait hold up? Have these waitresses not gone thru some type of food handlers training? Even if they didn't, do they not have common sense? Because you know it's common sense to not put hot drinks in plastic cups. Omg. They need to throw these waitresses back into kindergarten cus clearly they hired dumbasses. They also don't know how to own a business because the customer should always be right. We asked for the hot tea to be poured into a mug, but the waitress said the mug is for coffee only. Like wtf?! Are you stupid? Sigh."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend from Europe who insisted on going to a cheap Vegas buffet.  I didn't want to go but I humored him.  The place is filthy and the buffet doesn't look much better.    I suspect this place probably wouldn't pass a proper health inspection."}
{"text":"Meet a friend that recommended this place for dinner.  This was a great find in Las Vegas.  What made this place a hit was the Ox-tail soup, this is comfort food at it's finest.  Frog legs also was on the buffet, wow is all I can say, I normally have frog legs steamed over rice, so this was a refreshing to have frog legs deep fried.  The frog legs were not dipped in batter but just dropped in oil and deep fried.  A very good way to serve frog legs.  The rest of the food was very good with concentration on seafood. A must try if you are looking for a great asian buffet in vegas."}
{"text":"waaaahhhh...pls dont!!!try krazy buffet...good service, clean place, nice food!!!"}
{"text":"We were pretty hungry from hanging out at the pool all day so we were starved.  We arrived at 3:00 so we still paid the lunch price, which was @$8.  The price was really good because it includes drinks also. There were sushi, Mongolian bbq, soups, chinese dishes, salted prawns, fresh fruits and salads.  Yum, must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Payed when entering and was seated very quickly. They asked us what we wanted to drink and we were off to get food.  Still has the best asian food around the Vegas area. Good prices compared to the buffets at the casinos and the food is really fresh and flavorful. They have a lot of vegetable options, seafood options and meat options. They have a wide range of sushi options and even serve sashimi. The fish is very fresh. Mongolian bbq prepared in front of you, and you get to choose what you want in it. They even have short ribs, which is a first ive ever seen for Mongolian bbq.   I noticed as i was leaving however, that they seated the Asians away from the Non-Asians. haha that was funny."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place of extremes.  Floor is dirty, tables are not adequately cleaned and the tables are four inches from each other in many places.  The food is quite good which for a buffet is well above average.  The variety is not as good as it used to be.  Fewer Chinese dishes and more meat (chicken, fish, beef or pork) dishes without vegetables.  The Mongolian BBQ in which you choose your ingredients and they cook that for you is still the best deal in the house.  The crab legs, shrimp, octopus, clams and mussels were all good as long as you don't mind having your shrimp and octopus breaded and fried.  Sushi was slightly above average for a buffet and won't compete with any sushi restaurant this side of your local grocery store.  I like the place for what it is, a lot of good food at a reasonable price.  Wait service is poor but I suspect most tips are too."}
{"text":"I have been told to come here by several people and just haven't until today. Big mistake. We are so full, the food was good, the wait staff was the best in town and all for $45 for three people. We had Chinese food, seafood and sushi. Our waitress didn't let our drinks get halfway empty and removed empty plates fast. I wish I knew the young lady's name so I could mention her here. Great place I will be a regular now."}
{"text":"Very tasty, kinds of Asian food. U won't regret to be here. Our family like it very much. Many people came here to eat. The boss always takes care of his clients. The service is very nice."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star!  It is absolutely disgusting!  Myself and my guest both got food poisoning from this place!  We went there on April 25, 2013.  Our sickness lasted for days!  Everything on the buffet was old, dried out and room temperature.  And omg....the bathrooms....wow!!!!  Absolutely disgusting!  The entire place was filthy.  I knew we should have walked out immediately!  Just from the smell inside the place.  Whatever you do.....remember....you are taking a very very big chance if you eat here!  I think it would be more likely than not....that you will end up sick!  We actually got staph food poisoning from here.  Otherwise known as \"Staphylococcus aureus bacterium\".  I truly believe this place needs to be SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY!!!"}
{"text":"So we go here when we're really hungry for a buffet with asian food.   The food is okay with a variety of selections of asian dishes and sushi.   Of course, with buffet style, the sushi isn't the freshest sushi around.   Here and there though you'll find some good tasting sushi.  I believe for dinner they offer crab legs, at least they used to.  We had lunch this past check-in, and I think for the price, lunch is the way to go.  Still a good selection of food but a lot cheaper.  Everything looked pretty clean except for the bathrooms.  Lots of graffiti on the walls.  The service was not bad but they don't really ask if you need refills on your drinks unless you stop them first.   Don't expect high quality food here but you can leave happy with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets knocked a lot but I do enjoy the occasional Asian buffet splurge and I think this particular location provides a good bang for your buck.  I probably come here twice a year and I have yet to be disappointed.  The price for dinner is about 1/3 that of a Strip buffet's price with a plethora of options to choose from for food and dessert.  Along with your freshly cooked typical Chinese fare, other options include a variety of soups, a sushi bar, a Mongolian BBQ/noodle station, and American classics (pizza for instance).    What makes this establishment even more worthwhile is their crab claws.  Now if you're a fan of the buttery crustaceans then definitely go here one time!   The last time I had dinner here, the claws were replaced frequently and the size of the claws rival those of their Strip buffet counterparts.  An unlimited amount of crab legs is probably bad for the heart but good for the soul.  :)  This location hosts a private room for private parties if needed and the space is pretty clean and well-maintained overall.  However, the bathrooms could definitely use a make-over.     When you're trying to stuff yourself and your family without breaking the bank, consider a trip to this buffet.

{"text":"HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. I got there right at the end of lunch and beginning of dinner. They told me if I wanted crab would have to pay the dinner price. I said OK and I PAID FULL DINNER PRICE IN CASH. I REPEAT, I PAID FULL DINNER PRICE IN CASH. The hostess seated me and my waitress took my coffee and cream order took my receipt off the table. I stopped her and said, \"I NEED THAT RECEIPT for tax return/business expense. SHE SAID SHE WOULD GET ME A DUPLICATE COPY, BUT NEEDED TO TAKE THIS ONE. I go to the buffet for round one. They were just bringing out dinner stuff, but no crab. I grabbed a few items.   I go back to my table. The waitress brings my coffee, with NO CREAM and NO DUPLICATE RECEIPT. I asked her for cream and for a second time, ask her for a DUPLICATE RECEIPT. I finish my first plate and go for a second. Still no cream for my coffee, nor is there a duplicate receipt at my table. I try to get her attention, but she's ignoring me. Finally, after 20 minutes, I walked up to her while taking another order and asked her for cream and a receipt. After 30 mins she finally brings the cream, but now duplicate receipt, but now my coffee is cold. I asked again...... I was a bit pissed, but I don't mind ice coffee and poured the coffee into the excess ice leftover from my water.   Finally they brought out the crab and I grabbed a big plate full. I sit at my table and eat a couple of legs. The waitress and the manager come over to my table and say that CRAB IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR DINNER. I STATED I PAID FOR DINNER AND PAID YOU PERSONALLY IN CASH. DID YOU FORGET ALREADY. I ASKED FOR A RECEIPT, BUT YOUR LAME AS WAITRESS TOOK IT AND REFUSED TO GIVE ME A DUPLICATE. I WAS LIVID! WE WERE YELLING AT EACH OTHER. THE MANAGER ASKED ME TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $5. I REFUSED. WE ARGUED BACK AND FORTH FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND I DEMANDED A REFUND. THEY TOOK THE CRAB OFF MY TABLE AND TOLD ME I COULDN'T HAVE ANY. THE WAITRESS TOOK THE PLATE I ATE FROM AND DUMPED THE CRAB BACK INTO THE BUFFET TRAY. I ALSO NOTIFIED THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THE BBB AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS.   At this point I was disgusted and decided and went back to the buffet and got 3 plates of expensive sushi stacked a foot high and dumped all kinds of sauces on top of them so they couldn't put them back into the buffet trays. I set them on my table and proceeded to the out the door shooting birds on each hand in the air! You should've seen the looks on their faces. THE PLACE ERUPTED IN CHEERING AS I WALKED OUT THE DOOR!!! I should've know better to go to a privately owned Asian buffet. Especially with all the great buffets in Vegas. This would never have happened at a casino."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. It's so dirty and the food is always stale... I do not recommend eating here at all! I went with a large group one time and they sat us in the back room. It was so disgusting! The windows had dust and sort built up and the floors were covered with crumbs. Looked as if no one cleaned it for months! Also the sushi they served was very gross. Not fresh at all! Tasted like nasty gas station sushi with the rice all mushed together as of it was made from a machine."}
{"text":"This is probably the cheapest buffet that you're going to find in Vegas. AYCE Asian cuisine- fried rice, orange chicken, sushi, crab legs, oh my! There is a large variety of different popular asian dishes. Some of it can be really greasy, but it can definitely hit the spot. I will mention that the buffet price does not include drinks, so if you want to quench your thirst with anything other than water, you will have to pay extra. I will commend this place on their fast service. I have eaten at this place on several occasions and my drink never stays empty for long, and they always clear dirty plates very quickly.  Beware... this restaurant is pretty small. So if you have a large party (like groups of 8 or more), it might be difficult to find a table to sit together. And the space is really cramped... at times it feels like people are piled on top of each other. And on the weekends, sometimes the wait can be pretty long."}
{"text":"Love this place! ALWAYS fresh sushi, hibachi is awesome,  and always geeat to take family.  Love the service. ..never a bad time here."}
{"text":"I know ... I know.. a lot a reviewer gave this place lower points. I found this place by accidentally.  Com'on! In Las Vegas!! ... most people wants to goto fancy, nice, Hotel expensive buffets or restaurant.. remember?? one of my bucket list in Las Vegas??... what the heck! Let's try here! I'm glad that I tried here.  Once again... you can't judge by outside look. It's not on the main strip and not attractive area but Food was very tasty and fresh. I have to say their turnaround time for food is less than 5 min. I never seen or experienced that fresh food comes out that fast.. They used to have Mongolian station, somehow they closed now and served as sushi station. One of the menu  I have to give them thumbs up is \"oxtail soup\" that is special and it's not easy to find anywhere (oxtail is expensive as far as I know).  I had a very good experienced so far. And very reasonable price for buffet in LV."}
{"text":"The service was alright, we went to go get more food and wehen we want back to our table, our drinks weren't there anymore and everything was cleaned out. It was disappointing bc we weren't ready to leave yet.. The food was alright, not the best but it's there. Wouldn't come back here though."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely DISGUSTING and the customer service is terrible. I've been going to the other Buffet @Asia's for years but today I was close to this one so I tried it.   The female cashier was unbelievably rude and the food looked like it was reheated leftovers. The sushi looked dry and leftover and most of the hot foods were room temperature. This place needs a visit from the health department and Dirty Dining before someone gets really sick."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 stars only because my husband frequents this place. If you want an AYCE place that has reasonable price, then this is your AYCE restaurant.  Note: this place is often packed! Wait time especially on the weekends can be 20 minutes or more. Lunch will not include crabs. Lobster tails will only be included on the dinner weekend menu. Prices change during dinner and weekends will be more.  Dinner (weekend) - My husband likes it because the price is reasonable for AYCE. He likes the snow crabs, and the salt and pepper dungeness crabs. He also likes the frog legs, buttered shrimp, Manila clams, oysters, oxtail soup, tomyun, and Mongolian barbecue. I find the food salty for my taste. I eat the lobster tails (you have to elbow your way to the lobster tail area or stand and wait for a new batch which comes in every 15 to 20 minutes) and sushi but secretly throw away the rice (and yes...I feel guilty thinking of the many hungry people but my stomach cannot tolerate too much rice). Their desserts consist of cheap cakes and pastry, jello, jell and cookies. Fruits are typical:  cantaloupe, grapes, watermelon and canned fruits.  Staff is friendly and efficient. The place is very noisy...kids screaming and playing, plates clanking, adults laughing and talking loud, etc..."}
{"text":"So far so good! The food is hot and fresh and they have a good selection of food! It's my second time there and I enjoy the food. The area going to the bathroom is run down and can use a pick me up but other than that I like the place. The price is reasonable and perfect for my small family of 3! The service is good and they are great with drink refills. I will go back when I have a taste for Chinese food again!"}
{"text":"Been here several times over the past couple years so I guess a review should be done. Like all other buffets, you pay one price and get going. Most places dont include a drink in the price but this place does so thats a plus.  I went for lunch ($9.95 total with tax) on a monday afternoon around 1:30. You would think the place would not be that busy but it was packed as usual.   Like other visits in the past, their set up has not changed. You have 4 islands. One is usually designated the sushi bar (not very good imo). Another is the fruits/dessert bar (its ok). While the other two are main entrees like fried rice, soup, wings, beef ribs, steamed fish, fried squid, peppered beef, green beans, and pot stickers. These items mentioned are what I usually get because they are actually decent.  So the food quality is still the same. Not awesome by any means, but good enough for me to consume and be satisfied. Originally when I first tried these guys a couple years ago, the lunch price was only 7 bucks. My how times have changed. The dinner price is usually about 3 to 4 dollars more because they have crab legs.  Service is ok and it shouldnt be any worse. Heck, you are getting up to get your own food. All they need to do is get your drink and clean up your excess dishes. Nevertheless I still at least put down a dollar for tip as long as they are consistent.  The minus 2 stars are mainly for the price increase and the bathroom. Im sure they try to keep it clean but those idiot vandals always seem to write stuff on the walls, mirrors, sinks, etc with sharpies or with something actually sharp to engrave it. Sometimes I come in there to find that there is no more soap or paper towels. Also they will charge you if you get too much food and then dont eat much of it.  To put it in perspective, I will still come here occasionally just to switch things up a bit but due to the increasing prices, the timeframe in between each visit is gonna get longer and longer. As long as the masses keep coming here, they will continue to raise it until they notice attendance starts going down. Its all about supply and demand.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #151"}
{"text":"The food here was decent but not labeled at all or inaccurate. The floors were dirty and so greasy in one area of the buffet that it was slippery. It was too expensive and also we got charged separately for fountain drinks. The servers were very friendly..."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant and way below average food. How's it passing health inspection...food doesn't appear fresh at all : ("}
{"text":"Just don't go to the west location- it's gross  This one is always clean...no more Mongolian BBQ but for $14 that includes a drink for dinner this is a great off the strip eat if you like a great variety of Asian."}
{"text":"There are only a few things at this place that is fresh, first the price, $12.99 for dinner. The alaska crab legs, and mongolian grill. Everything else is in between rotted and getting there. If you get an ammonia taste when eating seafood, its because its rotted. Thats the breakdown of the protein. I can't understand why people keep eating rotted foods??? Do you like your sushi with brown edges??? So pick your food carefully at this buffet place."}
{"text":"The quality of the food used to be better.  The crab legs are very small now.  And the lobster was a bit \"mushy\" compared to firm flesh that it is supposed to be.  But it is pretty cheap for a dinner buffet where you can get seafood."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! Why it hasn't been closed down by the Health Department I don't know. The entire building is filthy dirty. The bathrooms are probably the most disgusting but the rest of the place isn't far behind. Bathrooms are used for storage & it looks as if they have never, ever been cleaned. One of the serving tables has a drain that opens into an open drain right in the aisle where customers walk. The food that is put out on the tables is pretty bad too. The sushi is old & dried out. The Mongolian grill wasn't even operating, and the items that were being brought out were overcooked & tasteless.This used to be a decent place to go when it first opened, but now it's a real shithole! No stars for this place, 5 stars if they shut it down!"}
{"text":"The food is decent , don't come when they are about to serve dinner during there lunch hours they will force you to leave .  They could just let us know they will be serving dinner soon and ask if  we wanted to pay difference . But instead the woman working   Gives an attitude  telling me it's dinner now . Because  I grabbed the nigiri  sushi and it's not all that great the fish Isn't fresh . Never going that place ever again ! Worst customer service ever ."}
{"text":"In this review I am going to get right to the point.  Food was not very good at all; with a few exceptions. Restaurant was really warm and absolutely FILTHY!!  The staff was extremely friendly and you knew they appreciated the business.  If they could just really, really clean the restaurant it would go a long way."}
{"text":"As Visitors to the USA we stayed in Nellis found this place by accident on our second night and read some reviews quickly before going in and where a bit concerned. It was almost closing time but the negative reviews seem unfair, the food was great and to get this array of dishes else where in the world prices are up over at least double. We decided to try early the following night and where suitably impressed again in particular the seafood. For around ten bucks a head better option than some greasy burger, fried chicken or pizza"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Not any more. Food was mediocre. Bathrooms were nasty. Waitress didn't want to wait on us. Not once did she come to our table to ask how we were doing or refill our drinks. We stopped her to get refills she acted like it was the end of the world. Very rude. Her tip reflected her service. Notta!!! Will I go back? No."}
{"text":"8 dolla lunch buffet...  It is what it is.  What do you expect when you go to an all you can eat buffet that is only 8 bucks for lunch and 13.00 for dinner.  If you want stellar service, food, and ambiance then go to the Wynn or Bellagio, that's what you're paying the 40.00 bucks for!   I swear this is like a tourist attraction for my fam and I bc we go here every time we are in town visiting my aunt and uncle .  It's not too far from the strip by car because really who wants to walk anywhere in that heat.  It offers a huge selection of Asian cuisine from seafood, to the mongolian style bbq, and sushi (not sure if I would touch the raw fish here but the crabmeat should be fine!).  While some dishes are hit or miss, I did like most of it especially the dumplings, fried chicken wings, Chinese donuts, shrimp, crab rangoon, and garlic tilapia.  I think they have crab legs only for dinner or the weekend?  The service and environment are fine, they take your drink orders and your dirty plates away, what more do you need?   I end up walking away with a  muffin top and double chin, but yes...so worth it."}
{"text":"If the food was as nice as our server, this place would get 5 stars but unfortunately it wasn't. The sushi felt like plastic and the rice was hard, the Chinese food was room temperature, nothing was hot or cold. The soft serve ice cream and the almond cookie was the best of this meal."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I have been to Buffet @ Asia but at a different location and it was way better than this place. You would think the food is consistent within the chain.   Our waitress was quite rude in talking and never smile. The snow crab leg and the salted crab was smaller than the other place.  The place closed at 10pm, but they start to mop the floor at 9ish, as if asking us to leave the place already."}
{"text":"I was impressed with how fresh the food look when I first came in!  When I come to asian buffet, I usually look for crab legs and sushi. And this place has it all!!  They didn't went cheap on making sushi, although the rice was not soft and chewy enough.  They got battered fried crab legs and the steam crab legs, which are both very good to me. Other seafood include crawfishes and shrimps and fried frog legs."}
{"text":"Where to begin?!? There is sooo much to say about Buffet Asia!!! The outward appearance looks very inviting, so driving by my husband and I decided to give it a try.... we should have kept driving!! If there was a negative 1, I would give it a negative ten! We walk in and have to wait to be seated because the receptionist is busy yelling at her two kids!?! We are seated at a dirty booth with crab shells in the seat and gnats in the window! Tthe food servers act like you bother them by asking a simple question...my waitress was more like the \"napkin bandit\" who acted like the napkins were hostages! Ask for one and you got attitude and given one at a time! The food is gross with very little flavor and all has a similar after taste like it was cooked in the same pots and pans, seats are dirty covered in food and grease, the dispensers of sauce on the table look like they haven't been wiped off in months, flies swarm the food in the buffet area, filthy bathroom with roach spray boxes of RODENT POISON!!! Really!!! My sake was served in a dirty decanter! Eat there at your own risk!! My husband and I both had the runs after eating a small portion of food. Where is a health inspector when you need one?!?"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting! I have nothing good to say about it and would give it a negative 5 stars if I could. I don't know why the Health Department doesn't shut them down. The entrance outside as you enter the building is filthy. Magazines, newspapers, etc thrown all over the ground. Cashier was ONLY interested in taking our money and answering none of our questions. She had a \"get em in, get em out\" attitude. Around the food bar areas was filthy on the countertops and on the floor with spilled food. Most of the food was not even hot! Variety was very minimal. Who heard of an Asian buffet with NO Kung Pao Chicken? Then, I made the mistake of using the restroom! What a mistake that was! I have never ever seen so many graffiti-ridden walls, mirrors and door frames. You mean to tell me the owner cannot afford a coat of paint to cover up the graffiti? Last thing was the server guys had absolutely no people skills and seemed to be bothered when we asked for a refill. I would never ever never ever never ever eat at this place AGAIN! Yuck!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good with a decent selection but the environment could use some work. You smell like the food when you leave this place. Ventilation is poor and during the summer it gets extremely warm. Because of the steam from the buffet to keep the food hot, it can get humid in there."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in Las Vegas and not expensive.  I've been coming here for years and the place is always packed and their quality is consistently good.   For 10 dollars you get better selection than some of the buffets on the strip that charge 20-30 dollars.   Restaurant is well kept and clean but not fancy"}
{"text":"My family really love coming to this restaurant, the food always great, the only hassle is waiting in line a lot of times."}
{"text":"I'm happy they lowered their price to match with other buffet spot around there. Food was ok nothing stand out much to me but the service was good. Waitress are attentive and working hard, my drinks never left empty. Overall I'm happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Some food has no flavor at all and their sushi rice is hard. Went home with a stomache..."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out the other day. It's actually located on Eastern Avenue, a bit south of Silverado Ranch Road. It's actually not too far from Freddy's Steakburgers.   The place was fairly packed on a Sunday night. This is usually a good sign.  I don't know. I just wasn't all that impressed. They do have quite the selection of food there. There was much more variety than I was expecting. The quality of the food was just so-so at best.  The skewers were, by far, my favorite item here. The meat was nice and juicy and was almost falling off the stick. I tore thru my share of those things! They have a Mongolian Beef station that was unmanned, so I really didn't try that out.   They have planty of your standard Asian staples liek fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken and so forth. They also have fresh fruits available. I grabbed a bunch of strawberries and grapes and some honey dew to boot.    The tom yum was too sweet , though. I couldn't finish that.  Tried frog legs here for the first time. Tatsed very similar to chicken(really!), just a bit \"chewier\" lol I'm not sure how to put that!  The inside is a little on the dingy side and the have some odd decor(like a disco ball). I guess they rent out part of the space for parties. lol I don't know who or why someone would want to rent out this space ....but okay...whatever floats your boat.  For the price I paid, I just wasn't overly impressed. Much of the food seemed rather bland. I may go back one day, because my friend seemed to like it, but I don't see myself going out of my way to come back.   3 stars"}
{"text":"Had a great experience,   Customer Service: The employees are friendly \"for being asian\" I mean its a different culture so they are definitely nice comparing to standard expectations.   Food: There isn't as many options in plates as a large buffet but for the price its okay.  Price: Inexpensive."}
{"text":"My mom & I are both legally blind so after we pay this lady who I thought was a customer said something real low and took off somewhere.  She comes back, gets closer to me and says, \"follow me\".  I tried to explain that I didn't see her and had difficulty hearing but she didn't pay attention.  Then our 'waiter' didn't take dirty plates (pre-bussing) during our meal and I only got 1 refill on water.  The sweet and sour chicken was all cold - even in the middle!  It sucked; I don't think I will ever return."}
{"text":"When you're on a budget and looking for a buffet to please some picky Vietnamese women, this place made us all pretty happy!   I was terrified to try this place based on some of the reviews, but it was our first night in town, we were exhausted from the 5 hour drive, and we were craving something Asian/seafood near our hotel at Hyatt Place. So we came at dinner time and paid $14 per person. Drinks included. Booze is extra.   They have a large selection of Asian food, seafood and sushi. It isn't \"large\" like the Rio buffet where you will find food from every part of the world, but a decent amount of options within the Asian food genre. It all tasted pretty good, made by Asian cooks, which meant that something like the fried rice had better flavor than the fried rice at even the \"fancier\" buffets on the Strip! What comes with buffets tends to be a lower standard of food quality, so don't compare the sushi to an Omakase restaurant, but I would eat here again! The calamari, pad thai, sashimi, and crawfish were amongst the things I tried and enjoyed. I recommend getting the sweet and sour sauce to dip the crispy calamari into. I love that there was a Mongolian BBQ section as well, but was too preoccupied with the ready food to try it out.   I wasn't concerned about the cleanliness of the restaurant as it didn't look like any sanitary violations occurred. The food was hot, fresh, and tasty which matters more to me. In my opinion with ethnic food, the grungy-walled places had the best tasting authentic food, and this place wasn't even dirty. If you're looking for a bourgeois ambiance then please go eat at the Paris buffet instead. If you would like to save $12, try this place out! It's a good selection of foods, typical fried Asian fare, and decent enough to please my mom and 2 aunts (who also went crazy over the fried banana there).   From there it was only a 10 minute drive to the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Oh man. This place was bad. As soon as we sat down, I noticed how sticky the table was. C'mon! The food was not good. Not even the ice cream cones were good. I can't even think of one item here that was...food. Avoid the seafood at all costs... Yes, avoid the seafood at an Asian buffet. It was all 'meh' at best. I just can't get over how bad this food was...it's making me mad just thinking about the $35 I wasted on this place. The only time I've left an AYCE still HUNGRY. On the way home, I told my husband that I was glad we have multiple bathrooms in our house, because we'll be needing them. He's currently in the bathroom... Again. We almost forgot to write this review, but my husband's diarrhea reminded us. Before you leave, make sure to grab your soggy fortune cookie!!"}
{"text":"This was definitely an impulse decision for me and my husband because we were so hungry. We decided to give it a try and disregard the bad reviews. It's a mediocre buffet and it's exactly what you expect from a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, so I can't really complain that the food was ookay. They had crab legs since it was dinner time and that made up for the other bland choices. The butter tasted like movie popcorn butter and it made me feel weird. They also had raw oysters which were decent, but I prayed before I ate them just in case I would get sick afterwards. Crab rangoons had little to no filling. Everything else from the fried rice, beef with broccoli, wonton soup, etc was bland and so-so.  On the plus side, the staff was super friendly and nice. They refilled our drinks and took old plates away quickly.    Case in point- it's a cheap Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with Buffet @ Asia for multiple reasons. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for chinese and decided we would try this place. When we got to the buffet, we were sat all the way in the back of the restaurant, in a dirty two seater booth, which was right next to the garbage, the dishwashing station, and the soda dispenser. We asked nicely to be moved to another table so they took us into the other room and made us stand in the middle of everyone holding our plates and drinks. After much confusion, we decided to move to a table next to our original one that was a little bit cleaner. That was just the beginning of a bad experience. The food was okay, typical chinese buffet food - nothing special. We both love sushi, so we were happy to see that they had a good selection. However, all of the sushi was sitting under hot lights!! It definitely was not safe to eat! Then, while we were eating, a family was sat behind us. About five minutes later, the waiters came running over to their table telling them that they needed to pay more (for an infant)! They were going back and forth until the family decided they would just pay for the baby so they could just be left alone. It was extremely distracting, uncomfortable, and awkward. The waiters were incredibly rude, laughing at the family and mocking them. Overall, it was an awful experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great place. The only thing that lacks is bathroom, it just needs some fresh paint on the walls.   Food 10 Mongolian and watermelon Price 7 Service 8 Bathroom 5 Atmosphere 9"}
{"text":"I never really been a big fan of \"Asian buffets\", where all they serve is cheap sushi, chow mein, fried rice, dumplings, sweat and sour soup, and you get the idea....but this one was actually pretty decent compared to the other ones. Yes, I have to admit that the variety was a little lacking, but the taste wasn't bad at all.  For the price, at around $8/per person for lunch, it really isnt a bad deal, except that price doesnt include drinks, so you would either have to just drink water, or pay an extra dollar or two for a soft drink. But for people who aren't a fan of soft drinks, or extra calories may I say, I thought it was good that they seperated the cost of food and drinks!  Moving on to the food, although the sushi wasn't the best selection, and most of the of course weren't of raw fish, it was pretty decent. This is one of the Asian buffets that actually had sushi and soup that I wouldn't complain about, and most of the time, these are the two big failures at these type of buffets.   Due to the cheap price tag, wait does take a while though. At arpund 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, the wait was nearly an hour. But if you aren't up for the wait, there's a beauitiful and thrifty, but also, unhealthy Mcdonals in the same plaza! Just throwing it out there."}
{"text":"If you want ambiance, five star environment,and great food, plus great service, do you think you'd be paying 10bucks lunch.  I give 5stars"}
{"text":"***WARNING***: Proceed at your own discretion. May suffer from PTSD after eating at this particular buffet."}
{"text":"It's alright nothing great. Not much seafood. Pretty much the same as all the other Asian buffets in town."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I've experienced better buffets for the same inexpensive price  elsewhere. My exboyfriend, his mom, and I came here for lunch and half way through our meal, the server came and informed us that if we're willing to pay 4 more bucks for dinner which came with more varieties of seafood. We pay and expect some great seafood action but it was not as good as we thought it would be.  Overall, the food sucks and not because I'm a picky eater, it's just the fact that they can't cook things the way it's suppose to taste. Like the sweet and sour chicken, CMON...they really can't make it right? It's like the easiest thing to make to perfection. And I don't think they even wash the sea food properly because I keep tasting gritty sand in my mouth. (Eww.) Most of their choices there are fried, It's like they're trying to give someone a heart attack when they leave this place lol. Anyways, either they're trying to hide the non freshness of their food or they don't have better creative ways of new dishes.  After leaving the buffet, I thought to myself that I will never EVER come back here ever again. I'll rather go all the way to the Eastern one."}
{"text":"Like any other asian buffet, it's cheap to get in and you eat cheap food, basically. There's nothing special about this asian buffet. The best things I got to eat during lunch were the salt and pepper chicken wings, egg drop soup, and squid.   They have this rule that if you come in and pay during lunch, you can only eat the food that's out for lunch. Once the time for dinner hits you can't eat the foods that are labeled \"dinner only.\" That pretty munched suck.   But being the \"rebel\" I am I went ahead and took frog legs out of the dinner portion. They were probably the best thing I ate at the buffet.   Service was eh."}
{"text":"This place made me sick. Lady was rude at the door at 1st. Then the food was disgusting. Dirty eaten off of plates all over the place on carts. Then the lady came with the check and handed me a pen and said \"sign this\" I said right now as I'm putting food into my mouth? This place is horrible."}
{"text":"Very Good Food and Sushi selection I come here a few times every couple months the prices are always good afternoons or evenings!"}
{"text":"My family and I met up with an aunt living in Vegas.  My aunt suggested this place for lunch.  Go to this place STRICTLY for the quantity of food, not quality... it's a buffet after all.  It's inexpensive and an abundance of food, but don't expect too much as far has having an authentic, high quality food.  You can definitely pay a little bit more somewhere else and have better buffet food.    They had Mongolian BBQ, which was alright.  Their Sushi Bar was \"eh,\" and the Chinese food was just okay.  I did like the variety of fruits (it was fresh) and Jell-O but who doesn't like Jell-O?  Plus, the service was good; never saw the bottoms of our glasses which is always a good sign.  I only had 2 plates - one for my lunch entree and another for dessert.  A lot of their choices did not appeal to my taste buds.    I can honestly say that I've had a better buffet experience so I hope I don't have to come back here.  *fingers crossed*"}
{"text":"Great variety, so so food. I didn't feel great after eating here. Filthy restaurant. The value is in the Mongolian stir fry. If you stick with that, you can't go wrong for the price."}
{"text":"It's pretty much a dump. I came here with a tour. Food is gross, service is terrible, and bathrooms are filthy!"}
{"text":"This buffet is a complete shame compared to there Henderson location. The staff is very rude. They have no customer service experience. Or they might not give a damn about you. I been here twice and the first time we got there at 3pm and paid. At 330pm the waitress came  and advised us if we wanted to keep eating we needed to pay$5 because it's dinner time. No other buffet does that. The quality of the food really does suck. Most times it's cold or does not taste well. In my honest opinion I would no longer recommend coming to this location. Please go to the Henderson location or just a completely different buffet. I see a big difference in the areas and the people that go there is what the treatment you get. Example this buffet makes you pay as you get in. There other location in a nicer area they make you pay after. Come on let be honest why they do that  So until there management hires actual English speaker and that know how to properly provide customer service I will no longer come here and I think you all should too. Please don't waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food! One of the best Asian buffets for the price. Has a lot of variety from different locales such as pad thai and gyoza."}
{"text":"Never never again will I go there very limited food bland and siting was crazy rude waiter's I can't believe the service there and after words my stomach hurted so bad it's not funny I would not ever go back"}
{"text":"A moderately good buffet. A variety of Chinese foods, Sushi and desserts. The food quality isn't great, but it's edible."}
{"text":"I'll take a rain check for now. I was getting ready to pay. Until the register lady made insult literally in front of me. Now worries...I will spend my money in another establishment with better customer service. Walked out.  Thank you for saving me my time and advice \"think before your speak\""}
{"text":"This place is absolutely not a good place to eat food. While dining here, I witnessed several food safety violations. One of them being putting fresh food on top of old food and the next being finding a metal shaving in the trays serving desserts. I have been here a few times already and it seems the further you sit from the cash register the less you get assisted. I was seated at the corner one visit and was barely asked by the bussers how my party and I were doing. There are many other places to have Asian cuisine, but this place is not one of them."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends but they did not have a large  table for us so we were all separated into tables for 2 and some into table for 4.  We were all separated and did not get to chat/socialize at all (uh,uh, not bueno at all).  Yet, at the end of the meal, the waitress went around and passed out to each couple a mandatory 18% tip bill. When I asked the waitress why the 18% when they'd refused to sit us together, she said something about \" but ju still a group\".....whatever.  My sister in law got really sick from the food and couldn't enjoy the strip.  She ended up going back home after the dinner instead.  She was having  stomach pain from the food.   :((  I am giving 1 star for the variety of food and another star for the parking/convenience."}
{"text":"Your pretty much paying for the lousy deep fried tempura lobster, that you have to finger to get a nibble out.. The crab legs have no flavor. They taste old and freezer burnt. My family went there to eat and out bill was $65 2 adults a 10 Year old and a 2 year old. I can see why people don't come here any more. I give it 2 stars for the ox tail soup. The waiters are rude and mad every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Buffet was great! Only around $9 and can get a drink for 95 cent. I had a Thai tea and it was really good. Now is not like gourmet food but is tasty and good enough for me. Had good variety of Chinese food, some sushi (I was little afraid of sashimi but reg sushi was good) frying station, ice cream machine with cone. Very good deal and def return."}
{"text":"Decent food at a great price. I usually come here when I have an urge for seafood. I even like that they have sushi."}
{"text":"NASTY, NASTY, NASTY!  We have gone to the other Buffet @ Asia and loved them.  This one was horrible.  It was filthy, the food was old and the waitresses acted like they did not give two S***S if you lived or died.  I had to take our plates to the stand because our table had a couple of plates on it.  This was the only one we went to that you had to pay for your drink?  It was so filthy I wanted to call the board of health!"}
{"text":"We have been there for lunch which was just ok, decided to go for dinner....what a waste!  Main food was over cooked like it was left over from lunch and it was 6:30 when we got there.  Ordered Korean short ribs from the grill and I said that I wanted it for 2 people.  Paper thin and they cut it up and gave us 2 small pieces.  Needless to say I'm going home hungry!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Was brought here by tourist bus. Food is mediocre and the place is not well maintained. Their rest room is horrible. You have better choice nearby Vegas, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It is ok for Asian food but I have had much better and to tell the truth the food kinda tastes a bit stale if that is possible.  I have eaten here 3 times and each time I was hoping for better like some of my old haunts back east.  This location is better than the one in Henderson on Eastern ave.  Lunch time is crowded and you will likely wait for a seat."}
{"text":"Now this is a regular place for my family to stop at when we are in vegas. It is definitely not as fancy or as good as the regular buffets on the strip but I will tell you this. For its price it is a good lunch alternative. We have never had anyone get sick and everyone always finds something to eat.   For 13 bucks you get exactly what you pay for and similar places in socal offer basically the exact same stuff. However, if you go to some random buffet on the strip you will end up paying 30 to 50 a person and about half the time you will be disappointed. So save yourself the hassle on of those mornings and get a lunch here."}
{"text":"This place will do for a cheap meal it's ony like $10.00 the food is not the best but it's not the worst.  Several options to choose from so your sure to find something you'll like dinner is only like $14.00 and they serve crab legs and the drink is included in the price.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"Majority of the seafood and sushi was not fresh. Very dirty, the waitress began setting the table despite previously spilled sugar and food crumbs. I had to ask them to clean it. The floor was wet and very dirty where they sat us and they ignored it until we complained but all they did was put napkins on the floor. One of the drinks was forgotten to be served until we were about halfway done with our meal."}
{"text":"Came here during Halloween night. The restaurant was 1/4 occupied.   This branch is cleaner and more spacious compared to the Rainbow/Sahara branch.   Food? That's questionable. I understand that it's cheap but the quality of food that you get is the same thing... The only one good dish here is the cubed beef with gravy. The rest is blah!"}
{"text":"Lots of items to choose from and friendly service.  Very reasonable price for a Vegas buffett......Highly recommended."}
{"text":"my wife and i have eaten at this place before...we went back today for lunch at 1:30 pm.. the food was disgusting...horrible......all the beef dishes were very tough, could hardly chew it. i think this place either changed hands,,, new owners....or the current owner doesn't care what kind of food he serves his customers... we would never go back there again.....time to find a new place.....danny and jo"}
{"text":"$10 all you can eat Asian food with a drink. There is a Mongolian grill where u can create your own entree. If that sucks its your fault. Haha. The other food ranges from good to mediocre. Just depends on your taste I guess. It's a great lunch spot for me n my coworkers. It's nothing close to gourmet but it will get you full and leave you satisfied. I've never left disappointed. Asian food with a drink for $10 u can't go wrong. Just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch during the week. Large selection to choose from and always clean. Just want to avoid stopping in when the Asian tour buses arrive. It can get crowded pretty quick. During this time they put out Styrofoam plates since most of the tourist are getting their lunch to go. Overall I think this is one of the better Asian buffets."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! The staff was very nice and very attentive! Food was replenished frequently and included lots of shrimp and other yummy treats! The price was reasonable! I'll definitely enjoy this place again in the future!!!"}
{"text":"I can't quite understand why so many people like Buffet at Asia. My wife and I tried the Rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting. The serving areas were messy, the food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.  Perhaps I am picky because I come from Australia where we can get amazing Chinese food (sort of like how in the US you can get great Mexican due to the proximity to Mexico). The fact that I don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - The place was VERY heavy on the seafood.  Vegetarians won't he happy either, unless you are one of those fake \"vegetarians\" that thinks fish are vegetables.  The final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage, if you left any food on your plate you would be CHARGED EXTRA FOR IT! I mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to OWN the food and decide what to eat. I don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management. I'd be interested to know if this ludicrous policy is still in place, but I have no desire to ever eat here again and will never know."}
{"text":"Decent food at a great price. Unfortunately, the place is so jam packed it's almost an inconvenience to head back to the buffet lines."}
{"text":"First time coming here in yeeeaarrss, and it's still filthy as ever. But hey, food is decent with good variety, service is efficient, and where else can you get Mongolian BBQ and ayce crab and lobster for $15 here in Vegas?? Only at the infamous Buffet at Asia of course. You definitely get your money's worth here. Just stay away from the sushi, and if you don't, expect some salmonella poisoning every now and then."}
{"text":"Good chinese buffet... It was the best chinese buffet I had been too... They also have crabs, oysters and variety of chinese food to choose from..."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a month with a group of girls for our Chinese fix. We always have a good time and the food is amazing. One of the things we like is the fact that there is a huge amount of guests that are Asian and that is always a sign that the food tastes good or is close to authentic. I am truly happy with the offerings and they are vast. Very delicious and continuosly fresh no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"$8.95 for lunch?  Even on Saturday?!  Sign me up!  Even their dinner prices look fairly reasonable at $12.95!  There are a ton of Asian type dishes, though most of them are Chinese-ish.  Although there is not a lot a meat present, there is enough to keep the carnivoures at bay.  The real key is that the vegetables are done fairly well, such as the asparagus and the brocolli.  One must be healthy when eating 4,000 calories in one sitting.  Eat the \"sushi\", but just remember... $8.95.  So don't get excited when you get a little tummy ache later.  There is pretty much everything standard in an AYCE Chinese buffet such as dumplings, egg flower, hot and sour wonton soups, broccoli beef, kung pow, steamed / fried rice, chow mein, sushi (think fake crab roll and some tuna type rolls), salad bar, fruits (canned type), teriyaki chicken, korean bbq, Mongolian grill, chicken and mushroom... well you get the idea.  I am sure it rotates all the time.  This place gets crowded since it is a recession and families need to eat.  Plus, it is a damn good deal!  If you are not a picky eater, you don't mind eating in factory style restaurant and you are down to your last $12 (tax and tip, you cheap bastard!), this is your place.  You may not want to take a first date here... or go for your anniversary for that matter."}
{"text":"Where to start, first off the food is over priced, secondly the food is served wrong, warm food is cold and stale while cold food is warm and mussy(sushi). Ate but very dissatisfied, wish I didn't eat here. Not worth the drive or money."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Food is delicious and their selection is well catered to.   Cost wise it is sufficient if u especially like seafood.  The Restraunt has different ethic dishes in the asajn cuisine. So when in Vegas, get off the strip and try something in the surrounding areas."}
{"text":"I don't know why I expected this to be good & no offense fellow yelpers, but yuck!  Maybe we went on an off night, but the food was cold, boring & bland. I should know better than to go to a buffet.  I never find them satisfying.  It made me & my husband feel a bit queasy all evening."}
{"text":"$6.99 per person for lunch buffet. So cheap, right?? Well, you get what you pay for. The Mongolian BBQ was pretty good, as well as the soups. Other stuff was just meh. A lot of greasiness.  Probably won't be going here again, even though the restaurant was packed. I think I'll try a real Asian buffet next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet a few times and it does not disappoint. The food is great and they have a lot of choices not like other buffets out there. I especially enjoyed their fried sushi which was really yummy. They also have a mongolian grill where you can choose whatever you want for them to cook  The price is not so bad either, you get good food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for their lunch buffet on a cross-country roadtrip.  Lunch for us was 11 dollars per person which covered drinks+tip  Typical asian buffet with eggrolls, dumplings, orange chicken, etc. They have a good selection of foods, with a sushi section(a bit bland) and a made to order Mongolian BBQ section that's covered in your buffet. I didn't notice til the end. However,  desert is lacking with few fruits and ice cream. The food was decent tasting compared to other asian buffets I've been to and the fact that I haven't had stomach problems the whole day means it's on par with ingredidents!   Service there was very sullen, as if workers really disliked being there. Basically, overall gloomy ambiance from them. However, did enjoy the neon signs over the food sections, very Vegas-esque. :]  I was short on time and only had an hour to eat. But for the price vs quality, I think it's a good run for your money if you're looking for an asian buffet in Vegas. Just don't expect superior quality service!"}
{"text":"I was invited to this restaurant with other family members on a Sunday evening. My Mom likes this place mainly because she loves to save a dollar. It was Extremely busy. I think it was because Sunday is seafood night I suppose. There were 3 adults and a 3 yr old (who was charged half price). The total price was around $53.  Places like this is why I don't really care for buffets because of it's cattle like ambiance. Shoulder to shoulder waiting to be seating to engorge on mediocre food. Sign me up! I am a sushi addict and their sushi IS grocery store quality. Meaning it has been sitting around way ahead of time. Only difference is the grocery store usually doesn't have too much of a selection. But if stuffing your belly is the goal..who cares..right :P Nothing fresh about it..it has a nice selection though.   General service was good. Lol...as I was eating my daughter said she could picture the owner swimming around in their office full of money. This place was jammed packed. Bottom line: If you like to stuff your face with low grade food and prefer quantity over quality this place is for you."}
{"text":"I come here a lot but recently I am not liking the service. The tables look dirty and it was quickly wiped. But it's the service that sucks. The lady at the register doesn't even smile, she's eager to get you out.. She tapes the receipt like she doesn't wanna serve you. Waitress can't even smile. Service just sucks here. You can't even understand them and when you ask them questions, they don't even understand you."}
{"text":"In 3 words.....Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Price has gone up and quality has gone down. This used to be a GREAT buffet, now it sucks bad. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"We came here for our church early Father's Day dinner and got the worst service from our waiter. He misunderstood our drink order and when we tried correcting it he refused to change the drink and began arguing with my mom and said he'd bring it when we pay for the additional drink. He walked away in the middle of conversation and gestured his hand as if saying whatever came back and continued to say how we were wrong. It was just one drink order that made him change and give us poor service. After he finally brought the drink he rarely helped our table, walked into my chair without apologizing. And the food was all chewy and hard from sitting under the heat lamps for way too long. Never will we come here again and feel it ruined our early celebration."}
{"text":"Look at the picture of the steak and lamb chops that they show in the picture and compare it to what you get, digusting!  They charge a little more because there is LOBSTER on the menu on the weekends, how special! NOOOOO it's so grossly prepared with gluey sauce and the huge lobster claws have no meat inside. Oh look some crab legs, that should be good, right? Nooooo it's dry and the most low grade crab I have ever tasted! Again a huge pile of raw salmon on a plate is \"sashimi\"? how do they get away with this? Look at the wasabi is all gone, but do they change it out for fresh? nope, the \"sushi chef\" doesn't care. Believe me go to Panda Express, go home and watch TV."}
{"text":"Muy rica comida. Buena atención Lugar limpio. Uno de mis lugares favoritos para salir a comer. Se los recomiendo. Felicitaciones escelente lugar."}
{"text":"The good was the price, large choice of selections, desserts, and sushi. They have items not found in other Asian buffets.    The bad was the service and quality of food. The service was unsatisfactory and many items were either under or overcooked.  I would not recommend this Asian buffet over others like Krazy Buffet."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst place to come with your family , you can't understand there English well and the manager mistreats the people and I really don't recommend this place It was the worst experience I've ever received"}
{"text":"It's got the usual good Asian buffet essentials:  1) Mongolian BBQ including that silent man that cooks your food right in front of you. 2) Sushi Bar 3) Pizza 4) Crab Legs 5) Fries 6) The usual chow mein, lemon chicken, and various dishes...  The plus to this buffet was that they had bubble tea drinks and thai tea as part of their drink menu!! I've never been to a place like that!"}
{"text":"Usually I leave a buffet with a major stomach ache.....Not this time. The food was good plus they had Kal-bi and crab legs. Service wasn't to friendly but that's usually the trend at an asian restaurant. I'd go back though."}
{"text":"Got very sick from this place. I eat other buffets every day. I'm warning you! Taste good but...."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this one, bad servise, the waitress very mean here, very bad .the food soso"}
{"text":"Only came here because our tour bus stopped here. Nothing interesting about food, they did not serve drinks unless we went up to the waitress and asked them for some.  I understand that it's a cheap Chinese buffet, but they went to another level when they made us use styrofoam plates and cups and plastic utensils. What kind of restaurant does that?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went in night before last and now my girlfriend is puking.. My advise go anywhere else. There dirty and the bathrooms are disgusting. OVERALL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!"}
{"text":"First time very good experices second worst waiter I have ever meet!! He rolled his eyes every time I try to get his attention and when I let another staff member know she quickly talked to him but this person would not even offer to take the plates or nither refill my coke (not that I would after complaining) one bad employee makes you have seconds toughs about going back.. P.S Sushi is not even worth it"}
{"text":"Well, if you want oyster, lobster for cheap price, this is definitely the place you should go. But If you want delicious sushi, you should go to the sushi bar instead (yes). The sushi is cold, not fresh. The deep fried sushi is really bad.   In conclusion, I am not a fan of lobster, so I will not come back again. I 'd rather pay more for more delicious and fresh dishes."}
{"text":"Buffet at Asia Overall 3.75 stars  Gold medal- Bang for the buck Silver medal - Chicken Wings Bronze medal - Fried Wontons  This place is definately the bang for the buck!  How do you beat a AYCE place for $8 for lunch?  You can't.    I love fried!!  The fried chicken wings and the fried wontons are my favorite.  They also carry oxtail soup at lunch.  At night they have oysters and frog legs.  HAPPY BUFFETING!!"}
{"text":"So, my parents told me to go to this place when I visited back in August with a bunch of friends of mine.  Out of the six, only four went, including me.  It was all the way past the Strip and into a very urban area that reminded me of my hometown.  The place stood out like a Outback Steakhouse around the corner of my house, so it was sort of easy to find.  When we entered, the place greeted me with it Korean employees and promptly sat me down, which is a plus in my book.  The employee was a young guy, probably in his late 20's taking our order for drinks.  When he asked us all, I suddenly looked around and saw a bunch of alcoholic drinks, especially sakes and soju (korean version of alcohol, a sweeter version of vodka).  My friend and i ordered some drinks and we all sat up and went to get our food.  The buffet had a lot of different types of foods like korean bbq, sushi of all kinds (mostly typical ones like california rolls), a lot of seafood options like king crab legs and such, and a LOT of desserts too.  My opinion is average (3 stars) for this restaurant.  Average food, but with many selections that anyone can like.  But, the option for the drinks are rare, especially in buffets.  That gave it another star.  This is a good place to go to when you're out in Vegas with a couple of friends.  The staff is good and the food is good."}
{"text":"The food might be alright here, but this place smells like a toilet. Smelling is a big part of eating,  and the smell here is horrendous."}
{"text":"Ambience: 2 Selection: 4 Price/value: 5 Great place to go if you don't mind recycled cafeteria plates, silverware, plastic cups."}
{"text":"Vegas Trip 2:25PM Got a phone call from my peeps im suppose to meet up with and they decided to go to this asian bufffet located in rainbow blvd called BUFFET@ASIAN II. This place is pack no line but all the people are  sitting down waiting to be seated. minimum 15-20 people per family. DANG had to wait to get seated but my people was not in the rush to eat so we went outside and just bs for a while until the owner came out within 15 min letting us know that our table is ready party of 10 + 5 brats. big family big group sat down and we ordered our drinks thai ice tea here was great but do not ask for boba it is not good not fresh. and here we go again with a big buffet meal but this time i am ready for this fish crab lobster sushi i ate em all did not worry about getting sick nor worried about my high blood pressure.LOL. Everyone was loud talking yelling at each other just to get there point across but that's asian life nobody listening but yourself. RATED this place A- excellent food ambiance was great but the service and locale was not great. will i come back to this place HELL YES...."}
{"text":"BEST AISAN BUFFET for the cheap price! All the food choices you get plus desserts make this place worth going to! The staff not so friendly but who cares Im not eating them? Im eating the cheap food and all I can eat might I add! When I want a drink the staff has always managed to get it there either in a minute or two no worries I'm not going anywhere and if I need to fill my own glass the picther is right there ready to be poured!"}
{"text":"When I finally arrive at Las Vegas my family decided to come and eat her for lunch. Okay for the price it's not bad only $9.20 for lunch and 13.95 for dinner. One perk about dinning a this place is that drinks are included in the price and you get a choice of Thai tea or soda! I never been to a Chinese buffet that offer free Thai tea as a option so that was cool. The food is pretty mediocre like any other chinese buffet. Food Crawfish- Delicious I really like the Asian sauce mix the crawfish with. The only problem was that some of the pieces i ate tasted really old and nasty Calamari- This was disgusting I felt I was eating rubber Sushi- I usually don't like eating buffet sushi but this place has okay sushi. They are always refilling the trays so you know it was fresh Mongolian bbq - Super bland didn't have enough flavor. Salt and pepper shrimp- I was eating this like a storm!!! The shrimp was perfectly fried ans season Wonton soup- Nasty don't get it! This soup taste like hot water Fried Chicken (Asian style)- You can never go wrong with chicken wings!   Staff-I dk why they were so rude. My family arrive round 3 pm and lunch end at 3:45. When it was around 3:30 they came too us and said \"If you eat any dinner items you all pay $3 extra!\" Like the way the server came to us wasn't really nice and there were other families that came in the same time as us but he didn't tell them. I feel like they signal us out. That what make me knock out one star."}
{"text":"You know those noobies that think the worst sushi joint in town is the best? In my opinion, this is what Buffet @ Asia is. This buffet is the opposite of \"thee best.\" Unless you want to get food poisoning, I suggest you turn towards a different buffet. Sloppy and grimey is what I would describe everything about this place. Food, taste-wise is okay. Freshness? I have no idea. To end this review, make sure you use the restroom at home prior. A tornado looks like it destroys theirs. (women's restroom anyway). Plain & simple, I wouldn't go here for quality."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for lunch and the other for dinner. Both times, we came as a big group. Lemme just say, they are serious about having your party all present and accounted for.   The Good Service Refills on water and soda Salt and Pepper Calamari (when it's just brought out) Oxtail Pho (when there's actual oxtail and not a dish of broth and bones)  The Bad Takes a while for things to be refilled at the different stations Freshness of the food items Cramming people into areas where you know they can't fit  Would I Come Back? Yes if I'm in the area and I didn't know what to eat."}
{"text":"2.5/5  The food here was simply OK. The sushi was anything-but-fresh bordering on questionable. Their chopped up lobster chunks were plentiful and decent. The hot shrimp was probably my favorite thing. The spicy chicken was actually spicy. The beef was terrible as expected at a seafood place. The soft serve dessert was too icy.   No one got sick and the service was good for what was."}
{"text":"great food ?waitrees are friendly and lovely?price was fine too ?we will be back soon"}
{"text":"the first time we came here, it was a saturday for lunch and we thought \"wow! how cheap for such delicious food!\". so we went back, but this time on sunday....ok.....the sunday price not so great. sunday price is the same as dinner price all day. but hey, it was still worth it since we got to fight over lobster with all the greedy-4 hour-buffet-eating locals. LOL the food is terrific, i can't complain about it. when we go visit our friend in henderson, we like to eat here. fresh seafood, crab legs, sushi is pretty good, lobsters and many of the typical chinese dishes. all drinks (not alcohol) is included too so i think my table had a good round of thai ice tea. i'm not sure why but their buffet stations have glass enclosures on the side by the clean dishes.... me and two of my friends hit our hands on the glass trying to grab a dish (3 separate times)...lolol guess we're just not use to the enclosure."}
{"text":"Today came here to eat once lunch lunch no lobster is also very good price affordable 10 dollars a can"}
{"text":"Buffet@Asia is a greasy great for a hang over meal buffet.  They have all the american Chinese dishes that many like to eat.  Nothing too special here.  Very average seating area, the food can be a mix of pretty warm to very lukewarm.  The price is good but the food is sub par to meh.  If you really just need some oily stick to your gut super sweet and fried chinese food for pretty cheap, eat here.  If you want some good chinese food head down the street to east ocean.  But for what it is, and you like cheap asian buffets it fits the bill."}
{"text":"DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE! First couple weeks living in Vegas went here for a quick sit down dinner, and the server had the worst attitude cause she obviously didn't wanna be working, everything was sticky table, chairs everything! And don't get me started on the food, couldn't even eat the seafood delight! It was all old, I suggest go out back and eat out of the dumpsters! Straight up!!!!! Last but not least when my party and I got up to leave no goodbye, no thanks for coming no smile!"}
{"text":"Huge buffet of Asian delights and even some American choices. I am not big on buffets but you may want to try this one."}
{"text":"Used to love eating here but the quality of food is unsatisfactory. The service however is great. Very friendly staff that works hard to keep our table clear and drinks full. Will not come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really love this place the customer service is great! I enjoy co.ing in first thing in the morning to avoid all the people in the afternoon"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Very snotty employees and workers. All of them are ********* to everyone unless they see you're part of their ethnicity. Right in front of me they changed their price from someone that seemed like their friends to me. I left because I wasn't going to pay different from what their friends pay."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet, this was better than most.  Crab prepared well, as was most meat dishes.  The vegetarian selection was somewhat limited though.  Great beer prices, 2 for one.  The service was not great, but still better than most Chinese buffets.  Rest rooms (m & f) were graffiti laden, almost as if that was intentional."}
{"text":"Their food is very good.  They have a great variety of food options.  My husband loves the sushi, I love the potstickers(which not a lot of Chinese food buffets have).  I have always agreed with the rest of my family that the food is very flavorful.  What you pay here is more than at other Chinese food buffets in Las Vegas but it is clearly because of the food, and to me the food is worth the price.  The only reason why I give this place a 4 star rating is due to the customer service.  In all the times I have been here I have never had a staff member smile at me.  They do make people feel like a number."}
{"text":"Not bad of place. The food was okay, my main complaint is the crab legs, not cooked well, not salted, when you even try to crack it open, it will not have much."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average in terms of an Asian buffet. The food was pretty similar to most places nothing to crazy to rave about. Their rice noodles are perhaps the tastiest around town; however you can tell other food selections were a bit old.  Server was fast and friendly and usually checked up on us to see how we were doing.  The plates and silverware seem a little bit used and it's surprising with how busy this place always is they can't afford new ones, some renovation, or deep cleaning.  If you're hungry and want some decent \"Asian\" buffet at a decent price this is the place."}
{"text":"If there was a way I could put a -10 as a rating I would. Just finished eating dinner with my mom and she ended up with explosive diarrhea in their bathroom. Food was not as fresh as it seems to be. Now my mom looks like a character from The Walking Dead.  I would stay away from this place for a while. Or until the health inspectors come by and see their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Fried mackeral: 8/10 decent. Steam fish:8/10 pretty good. Green beans:5/10 greasy and overcooked. Almost burnt. Pepper steak: 6/10 poorly prepared. Too much chewy fatty pieces. Fried chicken wing:1/10 was pink inside. Gross. Won ton soup: 7/10 did not wow me. Acceptable. Hot garlic chicken: 7/10 expected more flavor Orange chicken: 6/10 was OK.ish Teriyaki chicken: 5/10 meh. Fried squid: 7/10 tasty. A little tough. Seasoned well Seafood combination: everyone took the shrimp and left the vegetables. I got the last piece of shrimp and for broccoli. 5/10. No flavor. Biscuit with sugar 10/10 love these. Sesame ball. 10/10 yum! Orange slices 10/10 oranges. Service: 4/10 not so good. Drink orders really late. Conclusion: has potential. Need better chefs. Waiters and waitresses need more courtesy. OK restaurant for what you pay for. Would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"OMG me and my daughter just ate here I paid 13.28 for both of us adults 6.99 kids 4 bucks and the food was delicious specifically the baked mussels and the sushi I'm coming here again I'm in shocked on how cheap it was and so good..."}
{"text":"My standards are extremely low. 5 stars. Great place to eat if you have extremely low standards."}
{"text":"The food was ok, a lot of greasy food. Under our table was very dirty. Food and napkins stuck to table and floor. Overall cleanliness, poor."}
{"text":"When I am craving standard asian food I come here. My favorite spot to go eat during lunch and dinner hours with the family because it gives a clean place to eat and good enough service. It's packed with other families and that is how you know the place is deliciously legit, right??   Tonight was my third time here but second time for dinner. We came in around 5pm and were quickly seated 5 minutes after we paid. When we came for lunch it was a 10-15 minute wait for a table of 7.  My favorite food selections here would have to be their egg rolls (full of veggies & crisp), fried rice (fresh and full of different veggies, even ham and egg) and the endless variety of sushi (their soy sauce is just terribly salty).  For desert they have 8 different selections of ice cream, it's not soft and just perfect for sensitive teeth. Every time we come I fit their sugary donuts somewhere in between plates. It is so good. It is usually near the beef broccoli (beef is terrible - just get the broccoli).   The only downfalls I have about here is their crabs (I lOVE CRAB) and it's so small that you shouldn't bother with trying to get meat out. There is barely any in there. Plus I ate their shrimp and noticed they didn't clean the poop line. Eww. Beware.   Had a great experience tonight. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Paid $13.99 not including a drink per person, the only reason the price was high (I think) is because they serve crab legs and sushi.  Otherwise this buffet should be more like $6.99/person and if it was I still will not go back.  Sushi was brown like it had been sitting, crab legs were skinny but okay- the butter for the crab looked and tasted like cooking oil.  Several dishes had no serving utensil,  empty food trays were never refilled and the \"salad\" was a few pieces of browned lettuce floating in a watery pool.  The meat dishes were tough as if reheated,  soda tasted watered down and the restaurant smelled like bathroom cleaner.  I was actually worried I may get sick from the little bit of food I did try.  The servers were nice but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"AYCE lunch under $9 that offers every stereotypical Asian food known to white man. Here is a place you will find the strange ppl that live in Vegas. Just another surreal sight to see while trying to get thru your hangover from going to TAO and XS last night you know who you are!  Bonus: Mongolian BBQ grill and free Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"Never again.  RUDE. RUDE. RUDE.   My boyfriend and I came in a half an hour before closing so we already knew not to expect much. We walked in and the ladies at the front counter told us to look inside at the food because they would not be bringing any new food out, which was fair enough. We said it was fine and they gave us a discount which was nice of them since we did not expect them to do so. They quickly showed us to our seats and then we took off to the food.   After rushing to bring back our food to the table our server asked us for the receipt and I told her that we paid at the front already but if she wanted my receipt was somewhere in my bag and I would gladly find it for her. I knew all the servers were eager to get out of there, they were all sitting in the back and looking at us so I was looking in my bag in a hurry and it took me a few minutes to find it (it was in the side pocket of course lol). During this whole time she looked at me with a disgusted look and kept talking to her coworkers in Chinese. I swear she was thinking we never paid in the first place. I finally found it and she was like.. 'it says one' and then gave me another disgusted look. I told her it was a discounted price for two meals. Bad communication from front counter to servers I guess.   Anyways, the food was pretty good. The sushi was not fresh of course as well as other food but it was closing so I wouldn't mark down for that. All in all, the food was over all, good!  It was the servers that really made me upset about this place. When the table next to us all left, one of the servers rushed over to the table, counted the tip of three dollars and threw it back on the table. She shouted to her coworkers 'three dollars' and other words in Chinese and started laughing. Her doing that in front of all her customers was not cool at all.  We left in a hurry, since all 15 workers were staring at us hahaha. No 'thank you' or 'good bye'. Weird. LOL whatever."}
{"text":"I miss being able to go and eat.  The price is amazing and the food is fantastic.  It was one of the very few things I liked about Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food for the price and real great if you are pressed for time. Depending on which location you are at, they also serve Korean BBQ at some of their spots, and that would have to be my favorite at this place.  Althought the food isn't authentic, you will definitely find a dish you can dig into for the time you are there. I prefer the lunch time just because you really get so much food for your money."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars because not only they have an awesome customer service. Their employees are very honest and nice as well. Let's just say we left our iPad the day before :( called the following day and they have it. I love love their sushi station and if you are into clean eating they have steamed white fish and green string beans,   variety of fruits and salads. My mom loved the seafood station and my husband loves their ribs. They have so much variety for everyone.  A must try."}
{"text":"For price ,value , stir fry and beverage for approx 11. It's a steal. Big variety,  quality is usually very good."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place after passing it a billion times on the way home it was right down the street from me, it looked decent and the parking lot was always full so I said why not!   Boy was that a big mistake!   I went at lunch around 12:30 - 1 so you would think being a buffet the food would be fresh seeing that it was busy. Big time YUCKO! The food was dry and hard! I thought I was going to break a tooth eating their orange chicken! Then i tried their beef and broccoli thinking it would be better because it wasn't dry wrong again ewww so nasty, fried rice and crab rangoons were also disappointing!   I would never eat here again!   Please do not eat here unless your a fan of:   *Nasty food that's dried up and taste like dog food  *Dirty surroundings and eating next to strangers  *Racing to the buffet against other customers just to get some food!"}
{"text":"The hot entrees were cold, except the soup. Very disappointing, I won't return. To be honest, they had the largest assortment of sushi (49) and it was very good.. No hot and.sour soup, the chicken wings were unremarkable in flavor. I am being generous with a single star raying."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian buffet in Las Vegas. You can't beat the selection and price. It's about $10.50 for lunch with a drink and about $15 for dinner with a drink. They have Mongolian bbq (excellent), sushi (yuk, you need to cook that stuff, back home we call that bait) and 4 center hot buffet bars with food and 2 cold buffet bars with fruit and deserts.  I would give them 5 stars but they always seem to have a restroom problem. Time for a renovation and upgrades there. It will probably be a nightmare to do because they are always packed"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  They have a lot to choose from went there with a friend for lunch and he enjoyed it.  I liked that they constantly kept food filled running out and they refilled never empty containers."}
{"text":"Server kept on missing us even though we were stationed in the pathway to the employee section and they charge you got drinks.  Which isn't bad in the beginning but if you wanna switch drinks such as ice tea to a sprite, they charge you for the soda change.  Understandable if it was can soda but it's a Fountain machine.  Fountain machines are inexpensive.  Changed. Changed for the bad from what I've seen.  The Mexican workers on lunch break were being messy when they ate there lunch such as using utensils for one item for all to grab. Young fellow."}
{"text":"Good food & have a lots choices. All you can eat crab legs, lobsters and oysters for only $18."}
{"text":"I have some serious reservations about the cleanliness of this place.  Clutter is everywhere, the buffets did not look like they're been recently wiped down. And our table was sticky.    The selection is not great.  The taste/quality of the food was good.  Service was fast and friendly.    I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"My mother at times craves a buffet setting and this her go-to place since it's so close to home.  But I regret the visit every time. Privately owned Asian buffets in general have only one positive note, their low price. Other than that, the food is subpar and don't be surprised if you get sick afterwards. If you need a cheap and easy buffet fix then eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Not to be rude but staff doesn't speak well English and they're all the same race. They're rude and have no great customer service. No senior discounts either which is crazy because my grandparents only ate fries which is not good for $15. They're just like kids 50% as well!!   Bathrooms are dirty as well.  Food is very okay."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times for the lunch buffet, it was very filling, but after a while I wish there were more choices. I like that in the front of the restaurant, you can make a plate of raw food and have the chef cook it for you. There are an assortment of meats, veggies, and noodles for you to combine and have them stir-fry with soysauce. *don't forget to tip :)  The Asian selection is nice, there's the sushi bar, fruits/desserts, soups, appetizers, noodles/rice, meats, and veggies. Of course the food tastes best when its fresh and hot, so you just have to time it right when they re-fill the section.   The place usually has a good amount of people, but we never have to wait for seating. The staff is attentive, they always know when we are done eating, and bring us fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price.  We paid $9.99 lunch.  Variety of foods. No ambiance. Sticky table with crumbs on chairs."}
{"text":"Waste of money... nasty I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone made my stomach feel like my intestines were doing the cha cha cha"}
{"text":"I'm the duke at this restaurant and for some reason I never wrote a  review on this establishment I know weird right. Haha let's change this shall we. My mother and I come here often it's like our go to buffet for Asian cuisine. The restaurant is usually pretty busy which is a good sign, but when restaurants get busy the quality of the service get worse. The service here Is tremendously average, servers and bussers don't smile , I get a \".what do you want to drink.\" At least say it in question form ? lol. But the main reason i took a star off is wrong or lazy drink orders , if i ask for water with lemon and you agree to that and then you come back with water with out lemon that's a problem. It's either you were not actually listening to me, or your just plain too lazy to put a lemon wedge in my water. Besides that we still keep coming back and that's because of the food! The food carries this restaurant on its back. One of their most popular dishes that they serve is their ox tail soup ! super rich and beefy broth, good size chunks of ox tail. Delish! They also have a wide variety of sushi here and not just your average California rolls with imitation crab, they have actual tuna ,salmon, and clam  nigiri ! Along with some impressive sushi rolls , especially for a buffet it's quite surprising. But there is one more thing that bothers me and that's the actual upkeep of the restaurant, I remember being seated and one of the bus persons was clearing off a table and ended up dropping and breaking a glass Tabasco bottle , they cleaned it swept a little bit and sat us but I could clearly see glass on the floor and that was annoying but whatever. They need to constantly wipe down the buffet counters and check for any messes on the floor , also every hour go into the bathroom and check for any messes or empty toilet paper rolls. But  for the lack of attention to detail I took another star off. Overall we come here for the sushi and ox tail soup ! The food is really good for an Asian buffet so I do recommend trying this place out . GO GO GO!!!"}
{"text":"I was debating a while whether this was 1 or 2 stars :/  So tour buses apparently love stopping here. I get that. It's cheap, it's chinese. But there were 4 different tour buses that stopped here the day that we went. And for some odd reason, this place just was not ready. The tour we were on had been doing this same trip once a week for some time as well and had stopped here previously. So it's not like they didn't know a whole bunch of people were about to come in.  And yet, they still weren't ready. We paid our dues and were given a paper w/ a receipt, and someone took us to a table. Since they did not have enough tables for everyone, some families were combined. In the table we were at, with seating for 4, with 5 people sitting in it, there was a box on one of the seats, so only 3 people could actually \"sit\" at that table. After saying good bye to the box, we went to get the food.  Except there wasn't any. I think after my first go, I got a few noodles, some broccoli beef, some veggies, 2 pieces of sushi, and that was about it. I think everything else was just empty.   They also have fruit and apple pie that's not too sweet.  The mushroom with cheese in the middle was one of the better choices that they had, but it took me 3 walkthroughs to get there. It took them til almost the end (45 mins after we had arrived) to fill the sushi section. They had two sections, one of which was completely empty for the longest time. Smh. They have some soups which I didn't try and the rest are chinese foods :P  Plates are either plates that have some dirty stuff on it or plastic plates. utensils are also all plastic. Soda is DIY in the fountain in the back. And it's also kinda dirty :/  If I had gotten a chance to eaten some of the food, maybe a 2 star review? But since I had a very limited meal of almost nothing, I can only rate it on what I had.  Most pictures included with my review were taken after I finished eating..."}
{"text":"$12 buffet on a Thursday night.  It wasn't that packed, the service was great and parking was ample.  Food ranges from crawfish to pizza and Mongolian grill stir-fry to American/European style desserts.  Of course there's a lot of Chinese and Japanese dishes.  I've definitely been to better buffets before, but for the price you can't beat Buffet Asia.  Love it.  Love it."}
{"text":"This particular Buffet Asia was very accommodating to our family reunion group of fifteen (kids included).  The fresh oysters on a half shell (available only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays) were very enjoyable and had my full attention.  It was a popular menu item in our party, and the round table we sat in had a majestic mountain of oyster shells when the bill came.  So popular in fact, that I can't even remember what else I ate there!  So if you like gulping raw oysters to your heart's (and stomach's) content, I would suggest trying this place out.  The oysters pay off the bill fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Why the hell are there people selling fake brands of wallets, belts , craps, etc. Outside this location? That's ghetto. Theres bad service , the utensils are thrown on the table, and you have to ask for napkins and knives , why? You only get two stars for the ribs and fresh fruit. One last thing I noticed, is that there's a sign on the register saying \"no refunds\" , do people ask then?"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to going to a good buffet with a group of friends. One of them insisted we try this place (mainly for convenience in location and time).  After that experience, I'm not looking forward to coming back. Ever.    I was distracted with how dirty the wall and windows were. If the place is dirty, then I could only imagine how the food is handled.  The workers didn't look like they wanted to be there and well... unhappy people calls for an unhappy environment. Dislike.    P.S. We paid $60 for four people.  Should've went to the grocery store and cooked at home."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at this place once.  The service leaned toward the rude side...  But they were extremely busy.  Packed with Spanish, and Eastern people.  Children were allowed to do what they wanted.  I was told that a lot of Asian people think it's impolite to disipline their children in public....?  Considering that it was loud, extremely crowded, the food was good.  I ate a lot and it was all pretty good.  I would have enjoyed the lunch more if it wasn't so cramped, some tables so close to others, you could eat off their plate.  I would go back if there was fewer people and try to relax and enjoy what was offered.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate this place as a 6.5 on food....a 4.5 on service...a 3.4 on ambiance and noise."}
{"text":"Buffet @ Asia? Buffet @ China more likely.    Not a bad place if you like inexpensive Chinese food.   The servers are not friendly but they're quick, helpful and very attentive.  The pay-for-lunch-stay-for-dinner trick doesn't work here."}
{"text":"If I had to give as it will stop to this place I would The waitresses had a bad attitude not serving nice not good customer service for sure won't come back again crazy buffet much more better......"}
{"text":"We just left here and I can barely move. It's a giant buffet with all the right things on it. Now understand that it is a massive quantity, high volume buffet, so the quality of the food isn't perfect but it is so very good that I am giving this buffer 5 stars."}
{"text":"There was a variety of choices. The buffet was packed. The selection of food was good. Service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Simply put the food sucks and it's over priced at 16.49 you can get a better meal at McDonald's for much less"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place especially the price.. We always come for lunch.. I'm a little disappointed that they offer crabs anymore.. I love their fruit salad"}
{"text":"Great buffet in town!! Especially on dinner time, they have crab legs. Oysters. Shellfish and shrimps ...and the service is good!"}
{"text":"TLDR: sodas/tea not free; to-go available; ample seating; no charge for leftovers  This Buffet @ Asia location reflects the hard work of employees in making this location safe for the public. Make no mistake: not all locations are the same. Be wary of the other ones!  The service up front and table side is pleasant. You must pay prior to seating and no refunds are made once the transaction has completed. A gratuity is charged for parties over 8, but they check waters often enough and the waiters/servers never stop moving.   The food is par and not over the top. There isn't a flavor that stands out and it's pretty standard. It's what you expect at any Asian buffet place. Panda's express makes this location seem sub-par, but I'm sure others might frown upon my opinion.   Drinks are not free. They cost $0.95 which is not a bad deal, but maybe you might want it for the Chinese tea. The restaurant also has a sushi bar and soft serve machine. The rice is too vinegary, but that probably means it's safe at any temperature."}
{"text":"Like many others have said, how do you beat an 8 dollar lunch buffet? I went with my girlfriend and her family while we were visiting Vegas. It's a bit off the strip, but well worth the drive.  There is quite a bit of seating, and they were really busy at 1pm. We were seated pretty quickly, and our drink orders were taken. We didn't really see the waitress again unless she was clearing plates or filling drinks, which is pretty good for a buffet to be honest.   The buffet itself is quite big. There is sushi (surprisingly good), peet'n'eat crawfish, grilled fish, a few kinds of soups, quite a few fried and tasty fish dishes, salad, veggies, fruit, and desserts to go along with the normal staples at an Asian buffet. I would say it is more seafood heavy than non, but there is plenty of food for anyone to eat and get full on.   The biggest surprise was the sushi. It wasn't the usual, buffet sushi with dry rice, but it was actually made with a good amount of care. Fresh, moist and flavorful.   If you want to get away from the strip and enjoy a nice lunch with family and friends, this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place , we have been here so many times and never been disappointed, the price is reasonable , clean and good service definitely we'll be back shortly and recommend to all of friend of mine."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! The servers weren't interested, the food was just ok and the place was trashed. It was disgusting actually. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for $8.99 a person. There was a good amount of sushi available, overall the sushi items were good, fried rice noodles wasn't bad either. The fruits and salads were fresh too.  Egg Foo-Yung was disappointing, the piece I got was extremely salty but my husband's piece had absolutely no taste. This means the spices were not mixed well together. The pot stickers tasted OK, but the wrapping was falling apart. The beef for the Beef Broccoli was a little tough to chew.  The servers came around regularly to clear the tables of empty dishes. However, no one ever came around with a pitcher to refill our water.  NOTE: drinks aside from water is not included in the price."}
{"text":"MOST DISGUSTING CRAB LEGS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!  They tasted like they were soaked in one part water to four parts salt!!  I could barely eat them, and I was so disappointed because I waited almost 30 minutes for the staff to bring out more crab legs.    One star merited for their egg drop soup with fried wonton strips and soft-serve ice cream.    I WILL NEVER, EVER RETURN!!!  Still looking for a decently-priced all-you-can-eat not-overly-salty steamed crab legs (and not those itty-bitty skinny legs) place in Vegas, no more than $20pp.  Any help from my fellow Yelpers will be much appreciated."}
{"text":"This is probably the only location I like out of all the Buffet at Asia restaurants in town.  The food isn't soggy like the other locations.  Lots of variety.  It's above average especially for the price.  I actually don't enjoy the asian buffet places, but I can come back to this one."}
{"text":"this is for the buffet of asia  on nellis boulevard on the same shopping mall as the wall mart . i have been a couple of times   first the mens bathrooms are never clean , urine all over the floor dirty papers on the floor  the latrines are scared dirty . its a healthy violation not maintaining proper  higiene , they sit me down on a booth ready to eat . after observing they were food residue all over . the table  in front of me was not clean proper chairs pushed around not in them corrected  place . the next  was the same table across from me was clean with  a rag laying on  a divided particion wall with  no sanitizer bucket  ,same rag left and used again  and again with out any sanitizer , thats not place for  the rag its. a. wall used by patrons to hold on to it when entering the dinning room . the front desk entrance. oriental  guy  that you pay  at entrance also clean tables and  uses the same no sanitizer rag   to clean  is section .the section is the first one on your right once you enter the restaurante .. tables should  be proper clean and  a sanitizer rag , i have been on the one on eastern and rainbow corner sahara and they very clean ."}
{"text":"As for me and my crew that ate here back in June - we all thoroughly enjoyed not only the food, but the service. Our glasses were never empty and they promptly removed used plates from the table. You know it has to be pretty darn good when over half the customers are Asians; and we were invited here by none other than... you guessed it - Asians!  This is by far one of the best Asian buffets we have eaten at, and definitely better than any place we have found in S/W Riverside County. The place was clean and the employees were friendly.  The food was fresh and the variety was fairly large. We all pigged out and not one of us came down with belly aches, let alone food poisoning. As for the sushi - they had a decent variety, even sliced up dragon rolls. All of it was fresh, plentiful and did not have TOO MUCH rice as some have intimated.  Maybe we came on a good day, after reading some of the reviews below me (the one star review poster has nothing but one star reviews - hmmmm). But, when in Vegas this will be one of our must-go places to chow down, just like the 4 Kegs! If something changes my perspective I will make sure to update my review..."}
{"text":"This place is just alright.. The fact that the drinks come separately cheapens the Experience along with a few other factors...most of the people don't speak English here which is a big negative...How can u satisfy the customer when u can't even understand them...Thumbs Down! Typical Asian dishes..Nothing to write home about...Sushi was great lots of options...egg drop soup was Thick and Tasteless, Crab legs Too small to enjoy...salt and pepper crab was very tasty but again Too small...Desert choices are scary scarce like no edible options not even the standard chocolate cake...it was my cousins Bday so they went out of their way to make some sort of cake,brownie,cookie with candle...it was a thoughtful Notion..but he said it wasn't good...Lastly the after Effect I'm not sure just how much MSG they put in their food but it must be a Lethal dose as I have NEVER been this tired after a meal in my life I mean comatose ...it was scary...Overall good for the budget if in a  hurry and want a little variety..very little then worth it otherwise just take a ride in any direction and you'll be Happier..."}
{"text":"Wow. Where should I begin? Ummmm worst food ever. Used to come here often when i didnt feel like cooking  when it was halfway decent. Now i cant even find one good thing to eat there.  $60 for me my husband and 2 kids and to leave hungry really hurts.  We literally all feel sick. Do yourself a favor and do not go here. You will thank me"}
{"text":"This buffet is better than your standard low end all-you-can-eat Chinese place. It cost $26 for two adults for dinner with two drinks. You must prepay at the front then wait to be seated. There are 6 buffet tables. The food was hot and fresh. I saw servers at the buffet cleaning and replenishing food often.   There were several seafood dishes including crab legs, crawfish, clams and salt and pepper crab. In the back there is a sushi section. To be honest if you love sushi and you've ever eaten it at a proper Japanese joint, skip this section.   All in all, the food was decent."}
{"text":"If I was on a budget and needed somewhat of an ok food with a decent selection. Buffet @ Asia would be on my top 3 to choose from. Large portion of dishes is mainly East and SouthEast Asian with emphasis on seafood. So your getting a good value for the food that is being offered. They have a nice hibachi grill station where your able to create your own Stir Fry. Great for those looking for something different and fresh with the option of soy sauce and spicy sauce flavoring. They have a sushi station but I would rather go to an actual Japanese restaurant since a lot of the sushi taste like they've been sitting out. Some of the items I do enjoy is the Manila Clams and Crab Legs. Others are pretty much a hit and miss.   It's constantly busy and they have a large wait staff, so the turnover is quick. Do plan ahead especially during the busy weekend and holiday seasons. The inside is still stuck in the 90's and could use a modern looked but for now it's a decent buffet.  2017 Yelp Review #75"}
{"text":"My recommendation: This place is not worth the time or money.   Service is very friendly but that can't make up for the poor, and steadily decreasing, quality of the food. They used to serve beef ribs and good pizza but now they got rid of the ribs and I'd rather eat freezer pizzas from Walmart than that marinera covered cardboard they serve now. The only thing they had left that I thought was still worth the visit was this sugar covered donut hole dessert they HAD. That got slightly changed too so I probably won't be back to this buffet any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst buffet Ive ever been to. You could tell some items have been sitting there for hours and started to turn bad. I feel beyond sick as I am writing this, I dont know if I can finish everything Id like to say. But I paid $50 for three people on their lobster night... I got zero lobster. Everything was deep fried to mask how old it was. Staff was friendly but food was horrible. Im mad I even wasted that money. I could of just set it on fire and felt more at ease."}
{"text":"We have ate there for years. But are last visit was disgusting. Restaurant smell like a bathroom. For 2 adults and a kid. 48.00 and some change. Felt like I was robbed. Dirty. Plate after plate was not washed correctly. I will never be back. I also notice it was not crowded for 5pm on a Saturday. Maybe others have stayed away.  Sorry you food and dirty restaurant is no longer worth going."}
{"text":"My Mom loves this place and comes here at least once a month.  I, on the other hand, think it's just A-OK.  There's a nice selection of food, but it seems lacking to me.  Here's my +/- breakdown:  + Large selection of food.  There's plenty of options.  They even have Pizza, although I don't recommend it....it's an Asian Buffet for Pete's sake!  + Decent service.  This place is always busy and they usually keep up with the pace.  Food is generally kept stocked on the food lines and the servers keep the glasses full.  + Food quality is OK for a buffet.  It's not great, but hell it's AYCE.....this isn't the Bellagio Buffet.  + Price.  The price use to be really good, but they've been steadily increasing prices over the past couple of years.....but still, $6.99 for a lunch buffet?!  That's pretty cheap in my book.  - Parking.  Parking is a bitch when it's busy.....it's not the restaurant's fault though and my Star Rating doesn't reflect this....just saying, FYI.  Overall, it's pretty good value.  If you don't like waiting, I suggest going in between meal periods when it's slower than peak times.  Return Factor - 75%"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. I was surprised by their selection of seafood...I'm a shrimp lover and their spicy shrimp tasted way better than what I expected from an AYCE place. Our server was very nice, cleared dishes away quickly and was attentive in refilling our drinks. Recommended if ur hungry n looking for a great deal...just DON'T eat the sushi lol."}
{"text":"Still my go to spot and feel at home here. Food is always on point to my liking and the service is awesome. Been going here since 2003 and this place almost never disappoints!!!  The last visit was fun and all my favorites where there"}
{"text":"Never, ever, ever again. This used to be a great place to eat,  it was one of my go-to places for a quick no frills lunch.  Over the past few years the food quality and variety has really declined but the real issue here is the utter lack of cleanliness.    A few months ago I got sick right after eating there. Yesterday I decided to give it another chance since I needed a quick stop before going in to work and I was pretty close.  It could have been a fluke.  Nope. I've been violently ill the past 12 hours, had to cancel a full day of work, and screwed up my schedule for the whole week... all because I just had to give the spicy chicken one more chance, lol.  The restroom was so filthy that my hand stuck to the bar in the stall. I left really disgusted. I don't know if it was the food,  or the bathroom, or both...but this place is a pit of illness that simply isn't worth the gamble. Lifetime ban."}
{"text":"oyster and crap leg was so fresh. For the price this is one of the best. you should try!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a weeknight, we noticed their sushi was kinda dry but decided to try it when we saw they put out fresh. Well 2 days later my husband and I both have food poisoning. The only thing we both ate the same was the sushi. If you have a week stomach I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I love thier fried shrimp and the sushi. Service was awful. The waiters and waitresses would pass our the while time we we were there and check on the tables either in front or back of us. They don't smile and not friendly. Other than service food was okay."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times before this and I can honestly say the food isn't as okay as the previous times. Now I'll be the first to always admit that the food here has never been amazing or made me want tot travel long distances but it wasn't this bad.   I went with my mom and the girl that took our money in the front had a very unwelcoming face. No lie she looked like she was having a bad day which annoyed the heck out of me.   The food was sup-par if even that. It was an okay experience but i wouldn't go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Horrible service tis the season and your gonna charge 17 per person including children it is a mess the rest room looks and smells like a crime scene save your money and possibly your life stay away from this horrible place"}
{"text":"Good variety, quality is good enough for the price, very busy at lunch... Seems to be the hot spot!  Lunch is only $7.99 The value is there and better than some of these other lunch joints.. Wide variety of food from sushi to Mongolian BBQ (noodles), typical Chinese fare; orange chicken, spicy chicken, mongolian beef, potstickers, shrimp w/ veggies...and dessert too."}
{"text":"If I could rate this zero stars, I would! They were rude to us the moment we walked in. The cashier, the hostess, and even the 'servers' were all very rude. So, first we asked the cashier and hostess to speak to a manager but they said there was none available. After being seated, I proceeded to ask a female worker who said the cashier WAS the manager! Not only were they rude, but they lied as well! My Aunt and I decided to speak to the cashier once again, who then called the female worker who told me she was the manager. Supposedly, the female worker was a new employee (didn't look that way to me) which is ridiculous because even if you are new, you should know who your manager is. They were all speaking Chinese together and smirking at us like WE were the joke! Where's the customer service?! The 'new employee' said a remark to me which I responded back to her in the same tone, and she answered me with a rude, \"Whatever.\" Yup, can you believe that? A male server then joined their little crowd and asked me what the problem was. I told him how rude they were being and he just looked at me like he had no idea what I just said. He then said, \"OK? But what's the problem?\" Um, I just told you the problem! This was the first time I experienced such bad customer service ANYWHERE. Every employee began to stare and just made my whole family and I lose our appetite. We paid $17 a person and we didn't even leave the damn place satisfied. The funny thing was every other family around our table we're saying the EXACT same thing, \"This place is SHIT!\""}
{"text":"Worse place I ever ate!  Came here with my wife and son,  going down the line looking at all the mis-labeled dishes, the sauteed mushrooms labeled as chicken wings lol. So I reluctantly start putting things on my plate, sat down and took a bite of the mayonnaise shrimp, was like eating cream of wheat... mushy. Bit into the Hawaiian short ribs, it was like drinking a 1/4 cup of oil! I instantly grew a pimple. The steamed rice was like it was never cooked... hard like rocks.  And out desperation trying to find SOMETHING that was worth swallowing, I tried this mystery meat because there was no label, it looked like chicken to me... but it wasn't. My wife and son just \"forced\" themselves to eat because she would've felt bad for walking out. At least my son ate enough ice cream to get his money's worth lol. I had them take my price of the bill... will never return"}
{"text":"First time here and also the last time. The price is amazing. The sushi buffet is good and has a lot of variety to choose from.   I just can't get over how dirty the restaurant is. When I sat at the table, I can see all the smudges on the windows and the walls were dirty. It made me very uncomfortable to eat."}
{"text":"Go on weekends. With all the great seafood selection and quality for the inexpensive price, defiantly a favorite! I absolutely love their lobster, raw oyster with lemon and Tabasco, seashell stuffing with cream, oxtail soup, salted crab which I would dip with vinegar & eel and raw salmon sushi are my favorites. My family have been coming here for years, defiantly a good buffet for your money worth."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'd come back to this buffet, even for the decent price. I was extremely disappointed in both flavor and freshness. Most of the food I ate was lukewarm. Chicken was lacking in flavor and dry. Fried rice had some kind of mystery meat thrown in. No indication if fried foods were vegetarian, and green beans were wrinkled and tasteless. I did enjoy the 'Make Your Own' Hibachi station. The crab puffs weren't fresh but the flavor was good. I wound up only eating those for my dinner. Desserts were sub par, dry, and lacked diversity. I understand you can only expect so much from a buffet of Americanized Chinese food.. but for $10, you could easily drive down the street and get Hawaiian BBQ or something that doesn't taste like no attention at all was given to the cooking. I've had much better for the same price."}
{"text":"I love this little place.  Good food, decent sushi, friendly service, and tasty thai tea.  Prices are good, and there's never a wait."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, but I ended up HATING it. Parking lot sucks...The dead end is littered with trash as is that side of the buffet building. Their food is just like all the other hole in the wall Asian buffets you'd find scattered throughout California, but just a tad worse. This is the 2nd Asian buffet I've newly tried in the past 6 months and is the same result - STRIKE! They advertise a dinner special where you can order either steak or lamb chops, one piece per person....don't do it!  The steak is pounded flat and served way over cooked...the grill cook is so rude and all the other servers just stand around talking to each other.  Floors were disgusting....how do people even like this place!? With the lack of cleanliness of both their dining area as well as their parking lot area, thank god neither of us ended up with food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I love Asian food, but this buffet is yuck, staff not very friendly, food not always fresh, small n crowded eating area"}
{"text":"The food is good and customer service varies. The only thing I'll have when I go is their salted/pepper fried shrimp, calamari, sushi, green beans, and crab legs."}
{"text":"I really do love this location. Never disappoints. The only problem I have is that they don't label their sushi. I hate cucumber, and I ended up with sushi with cucumber and almost threw up. It would be nice if they put labels on the sushi. But anyways, the husband and I come here when we're too lazy to cook and are really hungry. I'm just sad that I can't have sushi now that I'm pregnant :("}
{"text":"It was the little sisters birthday. The parental units love the place, we had 24 people to feed its about $12 a person for dinner. This place worked and it had the seating space for everyone. The food is ok to good. Depends on what your eating. They have quite the variety and its kept fresh. Plates were cleared from the table quick. Beverages were always filled. Host and waitress were friendly with smiles."}
{"text":"Nice place 2 eat at the seafood was great nice and hot i would go again the price was good 2 and the service was good"}
{"text":"we used to come to this place a lot when we were still living in Vegas.  We were on vacation in Vegas recently and figured, \"let's visit our old stomping restaurant.\"    We were greeted and paid first (new policy) I guess there were a lot of people that just gets up from their table and pretends to be using the restroom but actually leaving. Anyways, not a big deal...  My hubby goes and gets some rice and what did he find in there? HAIR...he told one of the workers and the worker quickly took the pot and said thank you.  So, it's a good thing that she acknowledged.  Ok, so we thought it was over.  I go up to their fresh vegetable stir-fry area where the guy does it in front of you.  I picked my veggies (bean sprouts etc...) and shrimp and handed it to him...went and grabbed some of the food and headed back to him to pick up my stir-fried veggies and headed back to my table to enjoy this food.  I have been craving for this veggies all day...I'm about to dig in and what do I find? HAIR!!! AGAIN!!!  Is it booby trap day for us???  I took it to the guy and he said it's from the bean sprouts...I said no, it's not and I actually picked it up with my fork and showed him.  He didn't apologize but asks me if I wanted another one...I don't think so!   After all this happened, we kind of lost our appetite but we paid $50 for our freaking dinner!  So we were just careful of what we were putting in our mouth, sigh...    While we were having dinner, my son had to go to restroom so hubby took him. While they were in there, one of the workers came in to use the restroom, he went pee, and blew his nose in his hands and just rinsed his finger tips off and left...that is freaking GROSS!!!!!  By this time we've had it...so we just left...  Never ever coming back to this place again..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, some good, some not, but can't stand buffets with smelly dirty restrooms. If you are at a place where you are going to stuff yourself eventually something has to come out and when the time comes you want to be comfortable."}
{"text":"This is alot better than the other location. Food is mostly fresh and staff is nice. I'll stop by for a meal every once in a while."}
{"text":"This place doesn't desrve 3 stars. The staff are nasty and I saw a guy running plates to the line and he was wiping his nose. There was also a couple slobbering and eating each others necks in front of children while me, my folks and other people are trying to eat. The food is ok, but very unprofessional staff. I will not be coming back due to a very disgusting staff."}
{"text":"I think the food is just \"ok\" but the one thing I hate is poor customer service. From the moment me and my family walked in it was terrible! We were a party of 2 small children (3 yrs old) and 4 adults. When the cashier was ringing us up she tried to charge me for 6 adults and I politely reminded her we had 2 kids, she scoffed and told me next time I needed to be ready and have the kids line up next to some height measuring line on the wall. We were then escorted to our table. Our waitress took our drink order, I asked for juice for the little boys and her reply was \" we dont have no juice\". When I asked what drinks they had the waitress said she would just bring them Orange soda. (Whatever, at this point we all just wanted to eat) Overall it was just a mediocre experience. OH I ALMOST FORGOT!!..... When the waitress brought us a refill on our drinks she brought them back in the same glasses that she put her fingers in while carrying them back to get refilled! GROSS!!! The glasses were greasy too! When we asked for new glasses she rolled her eyes and told one of the bussers to get us new drinks.. The dining area wasnt too clean so that says a lot to me about how clean their kitchen may be... I probably wont EVER go back there. SORRY BUFFET @Asia... Work on your customer service and the cleanliness of your restaurant!"}
{"text":"My kid got very sick after eating here.  I should have looked at the reviews before coming here.  The employees are rude, the place is dirty. They measure your child to make sure they are under the hight limit.  Shame on me for actually eating here and allowing my little one to get sick.  I feel so horrible.    Do not eat here.  Please."}
{"text":"Cheap spot for decent meal but customer service is horrible.  If it wasn't for a family gathering I would have left after my incident.  I ordered a regular Coke but was given a Diet Coke.  So I asked her if I could change my drink out because it's the wrong one and she said no.  Confused, I go up to the host stand and ask for a manager to get the drink I ordered.  I don't think it was a manager that helped me out because she said if it was something she can take care of rather than a manager.  She comes and talks to the waitress and then comes back to my table and in front of my family, tells me that I need to drink all of it before I can order something else or be charged for another drink.  Out of our huge party maybe three ordered water, so I asked if they can get regular (not diet) Coke and I'll just drink it and she said no.    Whatever. We were here because my parents chose this place and my aunt from Hawaii was visiting so I decided to be the professional and be the bigger person here.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't a language barrier or miscommunication but maybe because I was looking so good that day.  But seriously, if you come here be sure to keep your cool because even though technically we're not stepping into a foreign country and have to speak with a foreign tongue, you do need to treat them like a kindergarten."}
{"text":"They now serve SPAM MUSUBI on their menu!  But not as good as the ones you find in the lil' Mom & Pop stores in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Mean rude ataff they just want your money... They rush you you cant understand them. The food is okay but it could be better and the cleanliness could be way better than it is. Oh and the lovely bums outside asking for money is always a plus NOT!!!! If you wanted to be treated like dirt go here.."}
{"text":"Crappy customer service stay away!!!! These people are d o rude and try in any way to make an extra buck! You can barely understand what they are saying and are fast to shut you up! The waiter rushes you! Food is okay but the staff really make this place suck!"}
{"text":"Of the few Asian buffets I have had here in Vegas, it was worth fgoing to this one.  The quality is decent and there are a lot of selections."}
{"text":"Well look at me ma!  Cranking out reviews like there is no tomorrow!  Aren't you guys proud of me?  For this review I will be writing about Buffet @ Asia...  I bet you were wondering why I would come here when I'm in Vegas?  1)  I'm the buffet king remember?  It's my duty to check out the land of the buffets and give them a piece of my mind!  2)  We were no where near the strip  3)  They said that they offered Lobsters!!  (For dinner only!)  4)  It's only $8.99 for Lunch!!!  (This price for a buffet in Vegas is awesome!)  So.....  What's good here!  Food!  Many of the hot items were tasty... Sushi wasn't so exciting, but they do have oxtail soup that was super delicious!  Light tasty broth accompanied by meaty oxtails!  Oh boy oh boy!!!  Prices!  Well... if you don't feel like spending $20+ for a strip buffet, here is a delicious alternate!  As for the lobsters.. I missed out... came here for lunch so didn't get a chance to eat lobsters...  So what are the downsides to this place?  - Sort of hard to find... tucked inside a business plaza but hidden away from everything and placed in the corner... - Parking is semi limited.... only about 10-15 spaces out front... otherwise you have to walk... - Decor is very run-down... some torn chairs are very visible.... doesn't put out a good vibe because it seems though that they don't really care about looking pretty for the customers...   Would I go here?  Yes.... for the food, price it's a total yes... but definitely not for the drive or the decor as they both are disappointing...  (the drive would be real far for those staying on the strip...)  But should you ever be in the Henderson area and is literally dying of hunger, I think this place can help!"}
{"text":"The best buffet I have ever had in my life and it's $14 and it's fresh great service and its family owned and it's always busy so tough to even get a seat I love this place and their soda is tasty and not over the top bubbly go here not the hotels for buffets"}
{"text":"This place has a very limited selection of food for their dinner buffet. Asia is a huge continent. This place has extremely basic Chinese-buffet dishes and offers no desserts.  I was forced to dine here by my roommate who likes buffets.... Two fish dishes were great; however, all the basics(orange chicken; beef; seafood delight) were awful. The only remotely exciting dish was fried potstickers(the frozen food aisle ones).  Dessert options were reminiscent of my granny's nursing home(tons of jellos and gross soft-serve ice cream in basic-b!?@$ cones). Old oysters in dessert area.         Dinner Price: $15  Alas, a hibachi buffet is being built about a mile away(behind capriottis on Nellis). I'd advise Mexican for dining in this area, unless you enjoy nearby Applebee's or olive garden(in which case you'll love this place!)."}
{"text":"This on the list of the worst restaurants I have ever been to.  From the outside it looks nice.. that's about it.  The place was dirty and if you have to use the restroom, you are better off squatting in the desert with the chance of getting bitten by a snake it was so dirty.  All of the food was tasteless and we barely ate anything.  Never again, avoid this place like the plague!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decedent. come when they open first thing and come when dinner first starts that is the best time everything is fresh. don't come late you will have to ask them to replenish the food that has been sitting for a bit or just all gone people eat a lot here.  The tables & chair's are all out dated and old sticky or just need a new look but other than that the food is pretty good. I wouldn't eat the ice cream they only clean the machine once a week which is a health hazard that would be the first thing to give you dhiarrea. I asked them just ask for yourself."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! We are regulars! Treated like royalty! The sushi is always fresh and wonderful! They get so much business that the food is always fresh. Great prices and so I'm love with the Thai tea! My favorite is their teriyaki chicken! We eat here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and it's a good price for all you can eat. the food is pretty good but better when it's fresh. there's no vibe at all and it's a more casual kind of restaurant. the bathrooms are not very clean. one time I went here and they had the same song on repeat but the service is good and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I live near here. Great place I also go the eastern location too and for some reason they charge the drinks here. Still have the same stuff food BBQ a bit stingy with essentials I gotta holla before I actually get it my self id give 2 but 3 is lucky enough."}
{"text":"The value is here. For $15, you eat like a king. Forget about the ambience, you come here for the food! If you love seafood and hate paying for the high prices, you come here.   Everytime I go to Las Vegas, I hit up this place. Yeah it gets messy, and your fellow guests are messy, but this is all about the food."}
{"text":"4/5 Location:  The location of this place is right on the corner of Eastern and Flamingo. It is at a very busy intersection, but is very easy to find and getting in and out of the parking lot isn't usually a problem. They have a good size parking lot, but it does get filled very quickly during lunch and dinner hours. I never have had a problem finding a spot to park, even if I had to park out a ways.   4/5 Food:  Food is your typical Asian buffet food. Noodles, rice, various meats, sushi, soups, fruit, dessert and so forth. Come early if you want fresh food. They do constantly bring out new food, but if you come during Lunch or Dinner hours, you may have to wait for the popular items. Almost every time I've been here, I've not been able to get any of the crab legs. People will come and get food like that and not just get a few, but several plates full of crab or shrimp!! Food that I typically would get, would be tasty and fresh, but on occasions I've seen dry out food and food that didn't look so appetizing. Not the best food, but for the price and seeing it's a buffet, I would come back again.   3/5 Service:  Not sure if it's because they don't really speak good English, but most of the staff are so unfriendly. They have one person that seats you and takes your order. She never had a smile on her face and she was so monotone. The waitress/waiter are no better. They don't talk to you, just bring your drinks and or refill them (mind you, they don't ask if you want refills either) and of course they come often to pick up dirty plates. They are definitely there just to do their job and nothing more.    1/5 Ambiance:  Building is old inside and out. Everything is outdated. Tables are old and wobbly for the most part. Many of the booths are falling apart and are hard to sit on. Don't look like anything has been updated since this place was built. Kind of smelly also. Bathrooms are almost always dirty and not well stocked with the essentials.   Please note, my review is based off of when I lived there a year ago. Things may have changed since I was last there."}
{"text":"I eat in this establishment on my trip to Vegas. The food tasted good and very reasonably priced. Fairly decent selections to choose from and friendly folk providing great service, Go for it!"}
{"text":"Buffet at Asia is our go to Chinese buffet. The selections are fresh, creative and are not directed at those who love American Chinese food. The seafood selections are always good. Tonight was seasoned Dungeness crabs, hot shrimp with the heads about 5 ways, octopus and more. There are many American Chinese selections but I tend to pass over them and so can only tell you the less adventurous never complain. The sushi is plentiful and varied. Try it."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here last night and we really like the buffet. it was a true taste of Asia and they offered a little bit of everything including all of our favorite Staples of the Asian food buffet. very friendly wait staff who are fast to pick up empty plates. the price was more than fair although a couple food items were cold and should have been replaced especially given how many people were there that night. Still though we had a good meal and we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I love this place especially on Friday Saturday Sunday when they serve lobster and fried crab the sushi bar is amazing is a must go place if you love sea food"}
{"text":"The food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end. Food is bad a year than a year?I never come back?"}
{"text":"It's ok food. If you wanna get full without spending much, this is your go to place. This is the best asian buffet they have beef, chicken and seafood. But I'm only giving 4 stars because they are inconsistent with crawfish lol but they replace it with calamari"}
{"text":"I came here after meeting to get some good with my aunt she suggested a buffet , luckily buffet Asia was just a few blocks away. The customer service wasn't good at all the lady was rushing us to our table and I couldn't even get a chance to put my change away yet .    Now to the food it all looks good but was only cold and not much flavor there sushi looked like tbhad been sitting all day and the nigiri was really dry . I had hoped the desert would be better was was disappointed there were only a couple options so I settled for Ice cream that was really good surprisingly. Not worth the $30 and won't be returning.  To sum everything up the food isn't good and not worth the money"}
{"text":"Let's just say.... worst customer service ever. All have shitty ass attitude. Couldn't even enjoy my food... place is pricey and isn't that great. The room we were sat in stank like dirty ass diapers. Def not coming back!"}
{"text":"Be Careful of which waiter you get. The young looking waiter's attitude towards customers is disrespectful - eye rolling and 'throwing' receipts on table. This restaurant doesn't deserve any tips!"}
{"text":"This is the worst I had ever eaten restaurant. Service is the worst restaurant. If you use credit card more than $1. And tell us it's bank to collect the money. This is we in to help him pay tax. Joke"}
{"text":"Good food when you hungry. Affordable and cheap, food tastes good and always hot. One of my favorite buffets in las vegas. Very close strip and good location. Place is always busy."}
{"text":"I love (or loved) this restaurant, however, on 02/26/13 this restaurant was closed by the health department with 50 demerits.  As of this writing (03/01/13) the restaurant is still closed. UPDATE: Reopened on March 12, 2013"}
{"text":"DONT GO THIS BUFFET Everything was gross af and nothing to eat Dirty and employees were rude Im not gonna come here anymore They also overcharged me and my friend and I couldn't eat anything."}
{"text":"Lousy food. Smell bad. None of the workers speak english. They act like they are scared to talk to you. Only good thing is affordable place. You get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great and inexpensive seafood buffet!! The food is delicious!! They have a sushi and Mongolian section which are my favorite! For lunch with a drink, the price runs about $10, dinner is a couple $ more."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST asian buffet I have ever had! It pretty much leaves Krazy Buffet in the dust. Everything was very clean and well organized. The staff was friendly and prompt with the drinks. The lunch price is $8.93, tax included. That is not bad for a buffet that includes seafood, fresh hot and cold sushi, and a custom stir fry bar."}
{"text":"This place do not even deserve a single star It's not worth for coming back to this place  Just in case you come to Asian buffet Eastern and Sahara take a look at floor and kitchen also the restroom  I strongly believe this place need to be shutdown for the business coz it's too dirty"}
{"text":"My mother came in and they had things sitting from last night and she asked if when they will have calamari out. The cashier started raising her voice and shouting at my mom. She was not friendly and another person came to her defense and told her off. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"There was a fly in the restaurant!! The fly was walking all over the food and once I told the sever, he tried to catch it with his hand but did not worked out so he left and said that it will go away!! The food quality is cheap which matched the price. Service was horrible. One star is good enough."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat. Go somewhere else. They even Charged me extra for my 10 year because he was taller than 5ft. Terrible service, dirty and smelly. Never coming back again.!"}
{"text":"no stars! place is disgusting. found a worm/catapillar in the kim chi. didnt give us a refund. gross. dont go there. for any of the food. it's so dirty. so dirty! so rude! so cheap! signs everywhere about extra charges."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!! Stay away, the staff is super rude! The soda is flat & watered down due to them keeping them in uncovered pitchers by all the dirty dishes. The food is disgusting, super greasy & very bland. The sushi looks old & doesn't have any time posted on it, yet they have a sign up that states that the sushi should be labeled with the time it was put out, so they know when it should be switched out. The food used to be delicious here, but it has gone downhill big time. I had the frozen yogurt & afterwards I had a metal taste in my mouth. The bathroom smells so bad, always dirty and hardly ever has hand soap or toilet paper. I most definitely will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This is the WORST buffet I've ever been too. The food was not diversity, cost you 1$ more to get your food into the grill, extra cost for slushies. The food was lack of season, the deserst was too few and too sweet. The employee was not friendly at all. they move the trash can around the table to collect dirty dish. 1 star is because I cannot give it 0 star. Such a waste of time comming here, you should never ever come here. 12$ + 1$ of the grilled food. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Good buffet. Not casino big or good but the price is right. Crab legs and standard buffet sushi."}
{"text":"amyone that lives in vegas knows this is the best cheap asian buffet in town."}
{"text":"Where do I start, I have heard so many good things about restaurant, especially this location.  I had told myself, before I bring my mom here, she considers herself Chinese Food Buffet Connoisseur so I had to scope it out. hmm...EPIC FAIL, not impressed, actually disappointed.  I hate wasting money, and to me this was a waste of money.  Saturday, dinner time, it was packed in there, there was a 15min wait to be seated. It was just me and my 3yr old nephew, yet they called out and seated numbers that were after us. (They lose an entire STAR for that tacky sh!t right, a potential 4STAR rating is still achievable right? NO, HELLS NAH)  We were finally seated, I promise it looked like a feeding frenzy in there.  I'm a sushi fan, it just looked very contaminated, people breathing over it, no please make my Sushi in front of me Thank You much.  This buffet over somewhat of a variety of dishes, but standard Chinese buffet fare.  You know the staples: orange chicken, beef broccoli, chow mien, egg drop soup, pizza, etc, etc.  Empty tins w/ no food, granted it was busy in there and maybe they could not keep up with the demand but when they did food did come out it was enough for like 5 people.  Some dished were piping hot and others were luke warm.  I'll just comment on the items I DID eat:  Orange Chicken: ok, I didn't eat this but I had to comment on this, Orange Chicken is my go to  item when I go to these type of buffet. Um, Orange Chicken is not suppose to be SOUPY.  I cannot make this up, it looked like orange chicken soup, NO BUENO.  Chow Mien: hmm, greasy, no crunch to the veggies  Baked Mussel: it was ok, mussels were minced with some kind of cream cheese and melted cheddar cheese on top  Fried Butterfly Shrimp: can't go wrong with this, its boxed shrimp, yum yum good :-)  Green Beans: greens beans are my fav, um yea they were greasy too and limp, no snap  Peppered Chicken: that was decent, but the jalapenos took over my pallet so I had to pick around it  Crab Ragoons and Egg Rolls: once again you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods  Pot Stickers: dough was gummy, at the edges it was hard as if they had been sitting out for a long time  Pizza: this is my little dudes favorite, he can eat 3 regular slices...he ate 1 slice and picked at the other slice  Sweet and Sour Chicken: no need for the sauce because the chicken was hard as HELL, another item  that had been sitting out way too long.  needles to say that was not consumed  Friend Chicken Wings: I didn't eat them, but my kid enjoyed them.  I'll say it again,  you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods  the SERVICE: BAD enough said (-2STARS for bad service)  Overall, food was not even So-So, I've had better, HELL - we've ALL had better. $25.97 for $5.00 buffet food.  I'm so done  So, we will not be back to this establishment, and I will take my mom \"The Chinese Food Buffer Connoisseur\" somewhere else.  I've had better, there IS better in the valley, but this is only my opinion, try it out for yourself and see how you like it."}
{"text":"Well at least im not alone in my 2 star review.  I call this greasy crap that I am forced to go to cause my dad lives close by.  It is all you can eat and pretty cheap, so its an old dad's delight. There is a huge variety to choose from and the food is sort of fresh.  And there is sushi. Luv ya dad."}
{"text":"If you want a reasonable asian buffet on this side of town, come here; but get here early. Great selection, at a good price, and attentive staff. This is very popular- the parking lot is always packed. Once inside, you pay first.  Then you are seated.  The dishes range from stir-fried noodles with vegetables, with a variety of meats- chicken, shrimp, beef, mixed seafood, some vegetarian, to teriyaki chicken, to rice and chow mein, to sushi (I don't really touch this) to pizza (don't touch this either), to salad to fruit and finally dessert- jello, tiny portioned cakes, ice cream. I almost forgot to mention the custom grill- you get your vegetables and stand in line to get your food cooked. Everything's not great but I managed to get lots of things that I like.     This used to be Que Mas, before that Chevy's, so the atmosphere is going to be different than most asian buffets. They didn't change everything but they did maximize space by adding more seating."}
{"text":"As with any buffet, you get what you pay for.  This place is about $14 for dinner if I recall correctly.  The Mongolian grill section doesn't have much selection to choose from, but it's pretty yummy regardless.  The sushi is surprisingly good for buffet sushi.  Pot stickers are really good.  Pepper steak is excellent.  Orange chicken is decent.  So why only 2 stars?  Well, it's the tour groups.  The place is a madhouse when the tour groups come in.  It's just too crowded to find any sort of comfort.  Not to mention the people on the tour group are frequently rude and shove you and cut in line.  They used to only have tour groups on weekend nights.  They are there all the time now, even weekday lunches.  Not to be racist, but there is a cultural difference that I just can't wrap my head around.  I don't understand visiting a foreign country and eating a bastardized version of food from your homeland."}
{"text":"good variety of food. there crabs are sooo good. price is reasonable., only catch is the service, notjing great. seems staff looktired and iverworked because they can't even give a smile. i come here for the food for sure"}
{"text":"A nice buffet that serves good food for the price you pay.  It's around $9 per person, so even though it might not be the fancies or the cleanest place it still has good food.  I usually go for the Cream Cheese Rangoon and the Mayo Mussels.  The sushi is pretty good for the charged price.  It's a nice cheap place to go with a family or just a few friends.  The service depends on the people. I haven't really experienced any bad service or any excellent service, just an ok service since they are doing other things around the restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the reviews on here. This defeats the whole reason for using Yelp because IMO, none of the people who negatively reviewed this restaurant have a clue about food. I am glad I had eaten here for the first time before I saw any of these reviews or I wouldn't have gone. Since then I fly in from L.A. every three months for years and NEVER have I ever gotten a bad meal or been treated rudely or had to wait for ANYTHING! Understand that I am a chef/foodie and specialize in Oriental cuisine so maybe you can put a little more stock in what I have to say. A different day maybe could bring negative problems but as many times as I have eaten here...hard to believe.  To start, I was amazed at them remembering me on my 2nd visit and now every couple of months I go there and get lots of love and friendliness. How many buffets do you know that remember your name? As for the food, keep in mind this is not Chin's or Nobu or Morimoto's or someplace like that...it's a buffet. And as a buffet, what more can you ask for? Besides the usual fare like crab legs and Mongolian BBQ, they have Frog's legs and salt n pepper crab and one of my faves...oxtail soup. Of all the times I have been there, never had a problem or get anything less than perfect service. The food is ALWAYS fresh so what more can you ask for and for less than $12? I take four buses to get there and back and will keep doing so. So people, get the sticks out of your butts and go enjoy this excellent place to eat. Bon Apetit, Chef Cosmo"}
{"text":"I have been here 2wice, and both times I enjoyed the food. I'm not a huge fan of the seating because its like a cafeteria type with the tables. Its like youre eating with other customers, kinda creepy.  The sirloin pieces were super yummy as was the chow mein and sweet and sour pork! I also liked the doughnuts with vanilla ice cream! Super yum!  The wait staff are young and nice, I will def come here again!"}
{"text":"I just found a piece of hair in my shrimp and snow peas dish and I inform the waitress that I needed to speak to a manager she took my dish away any got me another waitress trying to explain to me that all their cook staff wear hats and that things can happen all the time...she than came back and give me a 20% discount for next time just to shut me up... Worse service that I have seen with no resolution at all!"}
{"text":"Decent good Chinese buffet. Loved the lobster there. Although it is hard to get the good pieces of lobster as few folks were gabbing them as soon as they were out of kitchen. They had quite a few varieties of Asian dishes. But lobster topped everything. It was a different experience of eating buffet after trying out all the casino buffets. Yeha the restaurant environment is what you would expect if you visit a typical Asian buffet. But next time I visit LasVegas I would definitely stop by here for some lobster."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! For the size, the selection is small and the food is very bland.  Noodles were plain, orange chicken was just fried pieces of dried chicken in some brown goop. Very simplistic dishes that they somehow manage to mess up. The only thing worth eating were the pre made deserts that came out of a box. The establishment itself, it is very cluttered and disorganized. Sure it's $8 a person but you're going to get what you pay for, you're better off getting frozen Chinese for $4 from the grocery store. Drive the extra 5 min and just go to Chinatown. And to top all of that, the wait staff is just as bad. There was an elderly person that can't walk very fast in my party and before I could get out of the booth they had come to flip the table and bumped her out of the way just about knocking her over. That is  unacceptable!  I get you are trying to get people in and out like cattle but at the risk of your customers safety?!  If I could give negative stars I could."}
{"text":"Best bargain in town!  Time of visit: 1pm Cost: Under $10 Food: Wide selection with a high turnover so items maintain freshness and quality.  Been going here for years and having not once been disappointed."}
{"text":"Good selection and kept fresh. Staff not always as courteous or as helpful. Price and quality make this a regular for me."}
{"text":"reliablle food for $15 dinner.  crab is not the feature...they have good clams, getting better on sushi, mongolian BBQ is the real draw if you want fresh cooked chinese.   very crowded most of the time..so expect a wait."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Came here for lunch and I had to get my money back immediately. The food looked and smelled old. Please do yourself a favor and go else where."}
{"text":"The food is decent for the price, I have my couple favorite items that's what keeps me coming back. I will no longer go to this location anymore. I went with my 3yr old twin boys. They charged me dinner prices an It was 3:45 (still lunch time) an for both children. I told them \"I called earlier to clarify the price\" (witch is 3& under are free)(lunch till 4pm) an I asked \"why did you charge me for the twins and there only 3\". Both ladies said \"their taller then the line on the wall\". I don't understand how they would assume that because they were sitting down. So I called my boys over an they stood on the wall an were shorter then the \"line\" on the wall. Everyone standing behind me at this point are now looking at the 2 ladies probably wondering why their giving a mother alone with her little ones a hard time....The lady proceeds to tell me after clearly seeing they qualify for being \"free\" that she will just charge me lunch prices one of them. I don't understand they both met the requirements. It's just the principle! The other lady said she could charge me full price for both if I'd like. How rude!! Still got charged dinner price fir me even know dinner wasn't out an all the lunch food was old. First time going to this location. I go to the one off of Nellis 2 times a month an never had any issues."}
{"text":"The very first time I ate here, I was blown away.  It was cheap, and I could eat all the seafood and kalbi I wanted.  But over the recent years, there buffet has begun to decrease in quality and quantity.    Now, there is no selection for seafood.  I haven't gone here for dinner, but before for lunch they'd have lobster or crab legs set out with the kalbi.  I think they might've taken it away from the lunch menu and added it to dinner, or they might've taken it away.  I might just have to experience dinner here one day.    The location on Eastern used to be a little more cleaner than all their other locations, but so far not so much.  They have dishes laid out everywhere, and sometimes their table smells like wet towels.  Try avoid eating the noodles, or rice...it looks like it's been sitting out for a while and it did give me a sore stomach."}
{"text":"Worst buffet in the world, Second time I've gone in there where their sushi bar is half empty. I let it go when they started closing up early and putting chairs around the tables twice, but if I'm gonna pay for buffet at least have food on the buffet."}
{"text":"The service is terrible, and the ladies are so unfriendly.  However, they have awesome \"head-on\" shrimp.  They used to have such fresh food with a great variety, but over time their food selection has deteriorated, and the food no longer looks fresh."}
{"text":"What a bargain!!! The price is low already, and if you look out for coupons in the mail: Katy bar the door! I think I ate half my body weight in pepper shrimp. I went for lunch and from what I heard this is nothing compared to the dinner, I shall have to return and find out for myself, I may, however need someone to roll me out when all is said and done, or in this case eaten. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This place isn't great. I won't be back. Some of the food was okay but overall just not worth the price. It's also a strange set up. They have you pay at the end and drinks are not included in buffet price. So depending on when you go you could end up paying nearly $20 a person for mediocre at best food. Besides the green beans. Those were good but still not $20 good."}
{"text":"Another in my multi-part Las Vegas saga of reviews.   Although not legendary by any means, this buffet is a perfect cost to quality ratio. The after tax, before tip cost for lunch is around $17.00 including a beverage. The excellent sushi, crab legs and other seafood measure up.  Some exotic things you may find are crispy fried frog legs (tell your friend they're chicken wings), crispy fried squid (was a little over-cooked, but still tasty if you stick with tentacles) and a menagerie of shelled seafood prepared in a number of ways.  To be fair, a lot of the items they offer are garbage, but they have just enough good items to allow you to satisfactorily bypass these items of questionable quality.  Our server provided excellent service. Amusingly, although she had an otherwise thick accent, she could say \"you're welcome\" with absolutely no accent at all!  For those wanting to avoid touristy buffets with inflated prices for the same quality, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"You get what you paid for. The food is so so, the drinks is so so, and the service is well.... So so. They advertise \"lobster\" as if their buffet is filled with it. But honest to god. You are lucky if you can land a lousy lobster tail. It's greasy, small, messy, and the portion is horrible. You would think that because they advertise it so much the serving tray would at least be big. Nope.  So if you are looking for a cheap buffet that fills your hunger then ya definitely a go.  Overall : Pros:  1. cheap cheap cheap buffet $14.08 (tax included)  2. Not really a long wait line to get in 3. So so food, service, drinks  Cons; 1. Lobster advertisement is a scam 2. Food tastes w/e"}
{"text":"If you take it for what it is, it's a great place to fill up and it won't break the bank!  We go here at least a dozen times a year. There is a pretty nice selection of food from your typical asian starches to the flavorful meats. My favorite is the beef tenderloins, the oxtail soup, the sauteed shrimp with snow peas, and their ginger lobster. Everything else is pretty decent too. The sushi isn't terrible, but it should definitely NOT be the main focus of your meal.  They have a pretty nice Mongolian station too, they stir fry up fresh veggies, meats, and aromatics into one plate. Get it with extra garlic and spicy!  Service is fast and wonderful, which is VERY refreshing for your typical Asian buffet. The refills are ALWAYS fast, and they actually smile and respond when you thank them.   I will continue to dine here with family and friends because it's a great spot to hang out for delicious food.   PS: The have a full bar as well. ;)"}
{"text":"Buffet Asia  Good Chinese food. Decent price. Great selection. Better than most Asian buffets. About $9 for lunch, not including drinks. Prices for dinner differ on weekends. Your food will be hot and seasoned well. The sushi bar is just a decent alternative to Chinese food.  Nothing spectacular about the sushi. This place is always busy so food is constantly coming out. Teriyaki chicken, steamed gingered fish, and potstickers are my favorite. As for service, the employees seem to be working themselves to the bone, especially during lunch and dinner hours. Your dirty plates will be gone in the blink of an eye and your drinks won't go empty. Be selective with your plates and utensils as they are always a bit wet and dirty......  3/18/15 update: came here the other day and food was very sub-par and extremely salty... Sushi was warm. Soups tasted like hot salted water. Meh"}
{"text":"Came for dinner for $14.99 theres alot of selections including crab legs, soft shell crab, fresh made sushi."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch twice. Both times, I felt that the customer service was lacking. They didn't pick up our plates so it piled up at the side of our table throughout the meal. We asked for drinks a few times before we got any. We ordered iced tea, which was watered down a lot - it basically tasted like brown water. We found out later that there was a fountain soda machine located near the washrooms, so we got the sprite which was okay. I only tolerated eating a select few items: the curry potatoes, sashimi and chicken cutlet. The other foods were too salty and oily for my taste. There was also soft serve ice cream and fruit for dessert, but at that point of the meal I had lost my appetite. Overall, it was a disappointing meal and there were not a lot of options. I'd spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck!  Where else can you say you ate lobster, crab, sushi, and oysters for $16??   I've been to this buffet so many times that I already know what I want and where its at.  Sushi is not the freshest here, some days I skip it if it looks like it'll give me a tummy ache.  Oysters also have their off days when they're lacking sheen.. But hey, at least it is always available and I have the option of choosing whether I want to eat it.  I'm always amused at how people go cray-cray for lobster there.  People are like vultures waiting for the lobster lady to drop a new serving off and within 5 minutes everythings gone!  I always get lucky and get some lobster as they're refilling, but if you aren't so lucky, don't fret! They refill the tray just as quick.  I also like getting their salt & pepper crab, oxtail soup, mushrooms, fish, and fried chicken wings.   And I like making my own chow mein at their Mongolian grill. **add garlic and ask for it SPICY! Super yummy!    The service is also great! They're always busily taking away empty plates and refilling cups.    They have hot sauce!! Ask for tobasco, sriracha, or tapatio (they have all 3) if you need to spice things up."}
{"text":"Cheap place to eat chinese food.  Just like any other asian buffets in cali. There's unltd. Thai ice tea."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it's been good. The food is very good for the price. I came on a weekday, Wednesday to be exact and the service was good. There was a party reservation on the other side and the service was still great. There was an issue with another customer and she explained it to us and was very kind. The restrooms were also very clean, which is very important to me. Great cheap place to go to to get away from the high prices around."}
{"text":"i was a little turned off my last trip by the lurking buspersons, they eyeballed you every little bite and the signs posted everyhwhere that this is not an everyday buffet-you MUST eat what you take or you may have to pay MORE. seemedkinda petty & strange,were they counting my plates & how would they enforce such a thing -try to fet you to pay more after you eat or stop you after 3,4 or 5 plates & say \"sir you must now pay per plate\" The rangoons were freaking awesome i probably ate like 15-20 of them, the crab legs were hot, juicy and VERY meaty melted in your mouth. The wonton soup was good and sushi was fresh & tasty. Breaking the posted rules I continued to load up plate after plate so I could try everything the mussels the frog legs and everything else. Overall the food was pretty good, the ribs were really tough but the seafood was fresh and the DONUTS were hot and oh so yummy-I  ate like 6-7 of them.  Well there was no wait to get in or be seated and the place was packed, refills were fast coming,plates were cleared fast , for the most part the food was good-i'm a rib guy and it was a little disappointing. The price was right under $30 for 2 people. We will return."}
{"text":"Three of us went to Buffet Asia on Mother's Day, my wife was throwing up and her daughter and myself both had diarrhea. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I've been too!!! Sushi, Sashimi, crabs legs and oysters on a half shell just to name a few. Also very reasonably priced. *Only problem is Asian woman at front counter was VERY RUDE the second time we went so we walked out and will never go again!!!!"}
{"text":"They treat tourist bus customers like trash, they know we're not going to come back. We paid $13 cash including tax, tips and sell service. Cashier wasn't friendly at all. Of course we won't see each other anymore."}
{"text":"This is a cheap place. They treat bus tourists as refugees. We use foam plates, take own drinks, dispose out own trash, no credit cards, some more expensive food was empty no refills."}
{"text":"Food was cold & Greasy This location is not Good  I've been to the location on Sahara & Rainbow much much better I was even charged a different price then listed price also different price then Rainbow"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. Do not sit in the bar area unless you would like to eat next to a urinal.   If this place is not on Dirty Dining, it should be. I saw tongs fall into an almost empty tub of crab legs, so the tongs were filly submerged into the crab-water. A worker took them out and did not switch out the tub and did not clean or exchange the tongs and just reloaded crab into the water.   If that is happening infront of customers, what is happeneing in their kitchen?   I walked out as soon as i saw that.  I do not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Price is great, food variety is plentiful, quality is mediocre, quantity is good, service is blah, other customers are a bit \"hood\" at times, lol. Overall not my favorite buffet, but what can expect for the price.   We came in with a group of 9 people, and the hostess sat us quickly  which was great, until we got to our tablesssss. They sat us at 2 different tables and didn't even ask us or tell in advance. I thought that was odd.   I usually write super long and detailed reviews,  but I would rather not spend additional energy on this place, haha. Honestly I will probably come back if my family insist, but personally I will try my best to convince them to have us all go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is so dirty and the people are so rude. They fought with us because they thought we didn't pay a drink when we clearly had the receipt on hand.  Take your $10 somewhere else or across the street to Chick-fil-a   Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"I only came here because I wanted to get unlimited sushi for $13.  Or as I like to call it, \"ghetto AYCE sushi\".  There is nothing really interesting about this place, I do like the neon lights outside but that's because I have ADD and it easily distracts me while driving.  It really isn't good for anyone else on the road, but this review isn't about other people.  I would give this place 2 stars, but as mentioned...I like their sushi.  I could talk about the other food, but then I would no longer be in a good mood.  #sushi #cheap #heel"}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss for me here, in terms of food quality, or where I sit. The service is also great, but If you can help it, avoid sitting at the booths - they are tattered and weirdly arranged in relation to the table.  Like if I sat back all the way in the seat, there would be space for a kid to sit on my lap, and then another kid to sit on the first kid's lap and then the table. So, since I dont have two kids, I usually sit at the edge of the seat, and take it from there.  So yeah, if you can help it, sit at a table.   Anyways, the food is good, but again - hit or miss.  Sometimes their sesame balls are soft, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes the beef is tender, sometimes chewy.  Sometimes the sushi is fresh....you get what I mean.    But nonetheless, I still come back for more.  Why?  Well, in the city of buffets, Buffet at Asia still provides its customers with a variety of tasty asian food at a fraction of the casino buffet price."}
{"text":"I did not like eating here! Food was below-average quality. Sushi had no flavor - the only thing you can taste is the mayo sauce they squeeze all over ALL of the rolls. The Mongolian BBQ has no flavor (there's no sauces for you to choose like at a real MBBQ joint), lots of fried food (cheap), what fresh fish they did have (shrimp) I just didn't trust. Service makes you feel like you're an imposition. Signs all over the walls about the ramifications if you waste food. Jeeze. Never going here again. A friend talked me into going... next time I PICK THE RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL!!! Where do I begin. Well, NO customer service!!! Unprofessional!!! NO COURTESY, whatsoever!!!!  When my family and I arrived, the cashier was on her cell, playing a game. I had to interrupt, after standing there and not being acknowledged (should of walked out, THIS should have been a clue).   We were 4 adults, 1 child, & infant (no charge), totaled to almost $90. We were then escorted to sit in TWO booths (isle separating me from my kids). Requested we have somewhere we could ALL sit together (she seemed agitated that I asked). We were then walked to a larger booth (someone was sitting there, an employee), he was waved to get off (which, made me feel bad). I asked to be seated in the area where there were tables and she said, \"that section is closed\", so, we had to take the booth. The table was not cleaned, so we cleaned it as best we could.  The restaurant states they close at 10pm (we arrived at 9pm). In resturants we have been before, 10pm would be the time to stop letring people in, we figured we had about an hour to eat. My husband was able to eat a serving when our infant child had woken up, so my husband started feeding him. When he was done feeding our child, he went to get food. The staff had started to pick up the food. The waitress approached us as we were trying to get food and said, \"pick up all the food you want and take to the table\" (we were noticing that employees had packed the sushi in to-go containers, along with other food). I ask my daughter what time it was, it seemed that an hour had passed quickly, it was 9:35pm (and, it started smelling like Pine-Sol and other cleaning chemicals). At this point, I got upset. I went to ask for the manager and, according to Ingrid (she was the one who seated us), the manager had left. I asked for who was in charge, she said that there was no one, she offered to help. I told her to  all her manager, I wanted money some back (can't ask for all of it back, we were able to grab some food). The manager was unable to talk because \"his battery was low\". I was getting more upset AND agitated at them!!!! I said that my husband and kids were NOT done. That if 10pm is there closing time, WHY are they picking everything up early!!! According to the waitress that approached us earlier, she said that \"because it was slow\". I could NOT believe it!!!! I said that how were we supposed to know that 10pm meant only when they were busy!!! And, if that was the case, WHY not tell us when we walked in. We would have walked right out!!! Ingrid was very apologetic, she understood why I was so upset, but that I needed to call the next day for the manager. The waitress that approached us said that the only thing they could do was offer two to-go containers. She asked me to follow her into the kitchen (which I did and almost fell, very slippery. AND, as I am trying to catch my balance, saw a child in the kitchen), she was offering the food that was pilled one over the other. I just looked at her and said, \"seriously, THIS is what you want me to take?\". She said, \"Yes, there's shrimp. Shrimp is good for you\". I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!! I was done. I no longer cared about anything, other than just getting out of there....  WE WILL NOT RETURN, EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there last night for the very first time and the food was delicious. I showed up 45 minutes before closing time and the lady up front said I was still able to stay and eat but the chefs stopped cooking the food so I basically had to settle for the food that was leftover which was cool because there was more then enough to feed this beast. The only thing that I had a problem with which is very common in Asian restaurants was the horrible customer service. The staff was so eager to go home that they rushed us out of the restaurant. They must have asked if we were done about 5 times and started to clean and get rid of all the food before we even got done eating. I thought the staff was very rude and unprofessional. This place is delicious but the workers need to take a customer service class or two."}
{"text":"My mom treated us for my daughter's birthday here since it wasn't too far from my brother's home.  This was probably my least favorite of the Chinese buffets my mom has taken us to the past couple years.  The service was not too bad, but the selection wasn't as good as it could be and the foot just not as tasty.  Some foods seemed to have been sitting there for awhile, therefore, things that should be soft were hard.  It just wasn't as tasty as Krazy Buffet or the ones in the Phx area that we like.  The place had a nice ambiance, though, the tables were a bit high for those people who are shorter.  The taste just didn't make this place appealing to me to go back.  Thankful to my mom who treated us.  It was $13.95 per person for dinner and that included a non-alcoholic drink."}
{"text":"Look, this  was clean,  fast, good selection, food.  I love salt n pepper chicken wings, oysters, seafood veggie mix and tempura veggie. My coke was never out and three people for a little over thirty bucks at lunch time. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First the Customer service was ok. However, the food did not sit well with my stomach, so if you have a weak stomach be careful. Second, I noticed a sign that says if you don't eat all your food you will be charged (which means two things). One, usually when a sign says that it's because the food is not great so many people leave left over food on their plates (if the food was great, everyone would eat almost everything). Second when a restaurant especially a buffet is cheap on the food, then they are cheap with the quality. Thirdly, the bathrooms were nasty and graffiti writing all over the walls (this place was not in a good neighborhood). I recommend eating on the Strip or a casino."}
{"text":"I love the food here, customer service is exceptional on a given day, location is perfect.  Downside is that lack of parking space when this place is busy which is common, and no takeouts."}
{"text":"I met up here with a friend after work on Friday . It was just about dinner time so I paid to have the dinner buffet. The dinner buffet had more seafood but I ended up not getting any. I didn't feel like getting messy and plus there were no wipes so I didn't have much. I did have this seafood like cheesy mixture that they put on a seashell. I don't have any idea what it is but I like it! I also had their tender beef which was really good. I had their Calamari which was too rubbery and it definitely needed sauce in order for it to taste good. That was the only thing that I tried that I would stay away from. The chowmein and fried rice are decent especially with the chili sauce but I kept forgetting to put that on. They also have Lotus balls here which are my favorite!  When eating here you have to remember to only get what you can eat or they charge you for the left overs.I remember one time I brought my husband here and he loaded up on their pizza but he said it tasted awful. He didn't know what to do because he didn't want to pay for their rotten pizza. He ended up putting it on our neighbors table who already left to avoid extra fees.  I was scared that they were going to charge me for the left over calamari on my plate but they didn't. If you need a cheap Asian food fix this would satisfy your needs because there is a lot of options."}
{"text":"Decent place for a Chinese style buffet with helpings of sushi rolls and a Mongolian Grill. Lots of seafood like crabs mussels, shrimp and sometimes you can find lobster if it hasn't already been picked clean. At the Mongolian grill they also have some nice Kalabi short ribs, Tasty!  Place is always busy but the wait is never long to get in."}
{"text":"Horrible! Worst buffet ever! Way overpriced for the terrible food they serve! Yuck! I obviously would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Although my kids like this place, it's pretty much an Asian HomeTown Buffet. If you're looking for a lot of food for a decent price, I would say go ahead and visit."}
{"text":"Sushi selection is larger and better quality than surrounding buffets Asian buffets"}
{"text":"No stars!!!! DIRTY, FILTHY AND THE FOOD WASNT KEPT WARM OR COOL.....entrance is dirty, door is dirty. I don't know how they're still open or not on Dirty Diner!! Horrible!!!! I only gave them ONE star because I had to before posting this!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. You pay cheap for cheap food. The best thing food they have is the beef. The service here is so bad. My family and relatives came here expecting to all sit together. They told us we have to pay extra for that and split everyone apart despite the fact that there were lots of open tables. Would definitely not recommend if you're expecting a good buffet and decent service."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is ridiculously cheap and the food is pretty descent. I went here with my family and it satisfied me enough. Not bad for a cheap asian buffet. The good had descent flavor and it's not too far from the strip. Nice place to go when you're on a budget. I believe lunch is about $8 or $9 and dinner is probably around $14. Oh! And you can get Thai iced tea for free because it's included!"}
{"text":"Buffet at Asia is kind of a misnomer, there are no Indian, Himalayan, or curries available here. More like East and Southeast Asia. That aside, \"Asian\" buffets have been so pervasive across the Las Vegas Valley that it's nearly impossible to distinguish them apart. Orange chicken? Check. Beef and brocolli? Check. Egg drop soup? Got it covered. Buffet at Asia isn't special or better from the rest (except for that awful China Star. Todai is actually awesome, though).  My parents love this place, I've developed some animosity towards this establishment. It's loud, full of elderly Filipino people who think they're dining at Spago, and kinda gross.  Food wise, it's generic with a few bright spots at best. I avoid the deep-fried shit because I feel they use the same oil for everything. Desserts and meat cooked in the same fryer. Ugh. So I stick to their steamed white fish in soy sauce with green onions. Desserts? I stick to their fresh fruit and avoid their nasty ice cream station that sweaty kids flock to. Expecting great service at Buffet at Asia is like asking a fat kid to not touch a bowl of candy. It ain't gonna happen; servers are there to refill drinks, give straws and utensils. And even this task isn't met. All this while they raise their prices to unreasonable levels, I might as well dine at Sushi-Mon."}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. My bae and I came here on a whim while driving down Sahara. The price was right (being under $12 for lunch) so we decided why not. Once you walk in you immediately pay and get seated by one of the hostess. The inside is broken into one side which is a larger dining room area and another which is in the bar area with a few tables.  The buffet itself has about 6-8 individual carts ranging with a variety of options. I enjoyed that they had a lot of seafood. Some of my favorites were the crab rangoons, seafood toast, spicy eggplant and the fried rice noodles. I also tried some of their sushi which wasn't actually too bad. I'd say it was a small step up for grocery store sushi. They also had several popular items like orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, bourbon chicken, bbq chicken, eggrolls and some simple desserts.  For the price I felt this place was awesome. I'd definitely recommend this place over their nearby competitor, Krazy Buffet. This place seemed much fresher and had more variety."}
{"text":"What a dump. Cold food. Empty restaurant so the food just got colder. The crusty men's room looks like something in Afghanistan. Graffiti and rusty walls. If you do go, make sure you're there when a tour bus is there so the food gets cycled faster. Some of the food tastes ok and I don't feel sick hours later so that's good. That's not enough to make this place worth going to in a town with fabulous restaurants.   Lowe's is right next door. Buy a couple of cans of paint for crying out loud"}
{"text":"Wow was this place awful! Came here one time before and it was alright then but this time not so good. Everything seemed like it was made hours before we got there. The sweet n sour sauce had a funny taste and so did the egg rolls and most of the fried foods. All the sushi was the same exact thing with different sauce or vegi on the outside. So no variety there. The restaurant was very dirty. The salt pepper and soy sauce bottles on the table felt and looked like they were never wiped down. The floors were nasty and dusty.  2 hours later and I have this nasty after taste in my mouth from the food. I am staying away from Chinese buffets from now on!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent during my visit and not to mention the decent pricing. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about about the poor service, unless I was very lucky with the waitresses during my visit. I even received Thai tea on the house at the end. The two were very friendly and efficient. With my experiences with other Asian buffets, the food here is probably the best I've eaten. True, it doesn't compare to some buffets on the strip, but I felt like I received better service here than anywhere on the strip (other than the Paris buffet)."}
{"text":"Very basic Chinese food. Good for a cheap lunch. If you're an Epicurean, this isn't the place for you. I only eat chicken, fish, and turkey. And I tried all the chicken dishes.  Not the best but good enough to find something edible for lunch. Crab legs and other goodies. But still not the best tasting.   Buy one get one on beer and wine. Good deal"}
{"text":"The past three times that I've been here, I leave with the worst stomach pains I've ever experienced and the past three times that I've been here, I ate basically the same food. My dad even got the stomach flu from eating here. I guess it's just bad luck on my dad and I's part.  However, I give one star for the service which were always quick to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything. Another star for the readiness of the place for getting new trays of food in and getting the old ones out."}
{"text":"For the sake of your health, don't go to this place, I got food poisoning and the manager doesn't wanna resolve it and asked me to report it saying she always got those kind of complaints"}
{"text":"The food was 2/5, the customer service was a 2/5 as well. I stayed away from the sushi, the cooked seafood and just had some of the meats. I believe this is the worst one of the 3 BA's I have been too.   - Meat - 2/5 - Seafood - Did not touch it... Sushi - Did not touch it... It looked a little fishy! - Veggies - 2/5 - Fruits - 1/5 - Sides - 2/5 (rice, noodles, etc)  - Price - 2/5 should be less - Customer Service - 2/5"}
{"text":"I been here before an the service was great we when again last night an the service was Terrible the waitress was really rude ask for the receipt in a berry Rude way the bathroom was not in a good condition extreme dirty. They need to get better waitress with better attitude an friendly."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Disgusting.  Went around 2P.M. Luckily the wait time to be seated was short for the 2 of us, because there was nearly 30 other people waiting in the entrance to be seated. The restaurant was littered with abandoned uncleared tables and it was obvious people were impatient to get in and upset nobody was clearing tables and seating people. For some reason they had 4??? people at the register and only 1 person was doing anything.  We got put at a tiny maybe 2ftX2ft table that was blocking their fire exit near the bar. There were big house flies everywhere. Despite the other reviews here we had out drinks filled constantly, though the server never once smiled or talked to us aside from the initial drink order.  The food was so boring. It all tasted the same. Bland and lacking anything distinguishing. And in order to get back to our table by the bar we had to bring our food past the horde of hungry people waiting in the entrance.  We gave up after I found a large, dead fly floating in my drink.  So. Gross."}
{"text":"I'll be straight up.. the inside of the restaurant may look kinda ghetto, but the food here is bomb! And for the price.. hell yes. You've got your sushi bar, Chinese food, American food, seafood (the mussels and shrimp toast are sooo good), dessert bar, etc. Pretty typical Asian buffet. Always busy, especially on the weekends. I always come out with my stomach packed to capacity and ready for my food coma nap."}
{"text":"This place has every Asian dish I can think of. Tried their Mongolian BBQ and ate way to much from the buffet!"}
{"text":"$8.99 for lunch? You really do get what you pay for. The food is very...acceptable. Typical chinese buffet food, nothing to really rave about. The staff was unfriendly and the place was pretty crowded. Decor reminded me of an old diner. Bottom line, if you're looking for a cheap meal with average food, Buffet @ Asia is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wow! Don't know that this place would pass a health code inspection!? We approached the front door and found it to be so dirty itself that I was afraid to grab the handle and not come away with a sticky hand. The grease trail and spat out gum all over the front of the restaurant was not a nice welcome. We entered the place to see patrons who looked like they were trapped in an eternal fog. One look at the \"sushi\" if you could call it that and I looked at my wife and said \"nope\"! We turn around and reluctantly touch that door again. We then proceeded to the really nice Italian restaurant in the next parking lot over. FYI I've eaten in some pretty sketchy places, super dive taco shops are a favorite of mine but this place?! I just couldn't bring myself to gamble on it."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow.. That was single handedly the worst eating experiences I've ever had. Right before i had even loaded up my first plate one of the staff had so graciously burped next to my face.. It looked awesome but don't let the food decieve you, pretty much everything tasted stale and that it had been sitting out forever. The only reason I gave it two stars and not one is because my friend had been there a couple times and swore it had never been that bad. So maybe new mangement/chef I dunno but something definatly has to change."}
{"text":"Omg their amazing I love their food better than other buffets! And I've gone to multiple buffets service is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill so much in the last year. This will be my last time here.  This place is FILTHY. Grossly filthy. Every inch of it."}
{"text":"My parents go here all the time and they haven't complained much. We were here today for a family lunch and the price isn't bad, for $8 a person. Food is okay but I found a baby crab  in one of my mussels. The water also tastes like dishwater; I think this is how they get you to pay for real drinks. I have already lost my appetite by then. It's a hit or miss because I don't remember it being this way the past times I have been here. Hopefully they clean up a bit."}
{"text":"My first impression of walking in. filthy, dirty napkins swept to the middle of the restaurant next to the employee podium. So we looked at the food and almost walked out but we were hungry so we decided to stay.    Food was greasy, cheap and all around not good. Service was very slow on a night that wasn't even busy.  They don't fill the food fast enough, took 20 minutes for an item to come out.  I don't like writing bad reviews but this place is horrible.  Won't be back.  -10 if it was possible."}
{"text":"Great food, especially for the price! A lot of filling cooked foods though so you end up getting full quickly. The sushi is not that good, but I can't really complain. They have delicious seaweed salad and I could go there just for that. Always the same food, but it's tasty."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant more when I was younger because I obviously dined wherever my parents wanted to go. I can't say I ever hated it, but I never returned for a couple reasons: I dislike buffets, mediocre food, and rude people. This has basically remained true of this establishment.  My parents are celebrating their 36th anniversary and my mom really wanted crab. So that is how I ended up here last Sunday night for their Seafood Dinner Buffet ($15/person).  My first thoughts upon walking in is that it's crowded, cramped, and smells old. None of the staff were particularly friendly and the patrons were rude and lacked the manners and etiquette necessary for small buffet spaces. Definitely not my happy place.   The selections for me were minimal. I found solace in the Calamari, Spicy Chicken, White Rice, Schezwan Green Beans, Sautéed Mushrooms and vegetables picked out of other dishes. I really liked the Spicy Chicken because it had a black bean sauce, but beware, it is very spicy. The calamari was not fresh, however, I liked the large pieces and preparation. Everything else wasn't bad. I also enjoyed the Cream Cheese Wantons, but they definitely weren't as good as I remembered. I tried the Grilled Chicken, Lobster, Spicy Crab, and Crispy Shrimp, but did not like any of them. The lobster was just gross, the shrimp was non-existent in its crispy form, and the crab was just okay. Nothing tasty. My mom REALLY enjoyed the Spicy Crab and my dad and fiancé seemed to enjoy their selections (the fiancé was satisfied with Fried Noodles, Grilled Chicken, and Mushrooms - his favorite foods).  If my parents try to convince me to come here again, I may give in, but not without a few groans and complaints. But, my return is still very unlikely. There are MUCH better eateries for all foods found here that are not horribly priced when quality and taste is taken into consideration. Even if you love seafood and can't take your eyes off the extremely cheap $15 price tag, just think about your taste buds and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to describe the quality of the food with so many other distractions:   1.  The staff is a group of pan-faced miserable Chinese who either hate        their employer, their customers or both.  The Hispanic employees         are far more hospitable.   2.  The entire premises is FILTHY.  Floors with dirty, soiled towels are         visible throughout the food area.  Restrooms are despicable.   3.   Eating utensils show inadequate cleaning, are bent with age and          use.  The sensation of using two bent forks left the food tasteless.  The food is so different than it used to be.  Quality of food has been degraded while dining prices have only increased.  More costly food items run out early (8:00 PM) and of course are not replenished.    The owners of this business are dancing all the way to the bank, but no longer with my money."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very clean, and yummy food! I think the sushi there was the best buffet-sushi I've had. The food was all fresh and the selection was huge. And not a bad deal for only $25 for 2 people (lunch price). It's a good place to go when you're not quite sure what you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"I have been to several Buffet Asia's and all have been pretty nasty.. so I decided to give it one more try and go to the one close to my house, big mistake. Witnessed a server drop a fortune cookie on the floor and place it back on the check presenter on the table next to mine.. that was just the start of our dining experience. The waitress asked for our drink order and as we were giving it to her she was walked away saying, \"ok,ok thank you\".. all the tags on the line are incorrect and tons of cross contamination, not to mention they have raw oysters that are just sitting there and are at room temperature which is very dangerous!! They have store bought almond cookies and the salad bar has a big huge green light that says salads but all they have is cut romaine and that's it..  all the dipping sauces has a film on the meaning they are old and have been sitting there.. I could go on about all the health code violations they have here but it's way too much to list. All in all, if you're looking to get food poisoning then come to this place, you'll be sure to sick from something here!"}
{"text":"There's a couple in town. This is probably the worst of the bunch. The food is blah. The seafood boiled to perfection, which means there's no flavor. How do you boil the taste out of shrimp? The selection is much smaller than the other locations. Go to the Rainbow or Flamingo one but I would avoid this one."}
{"text":"This location is probably the best one in this chain. I like their fried crabs but they only have it for dinner. The sushi is actually decent to eat unlike Red Rock casino's. The rest of the food is not too bad. I usually get a piece of the fried fish, beef and broccoli, and the salt and pepper shrimp. You can also get your own custom made stir fry too at the stir fry station. The place does get busy during dinner hours so you might arrive early or a little later. Honestly, I only come if I get a craving for their fried crab (tiny crab btw)."}
{"text":"When I first came here I was amazed by how much food they were serving. It is a usual buffet so you can go and pick out which food you want to eat. They have many different varieties to choose from and they are all in their own section. The place was nice, clean, and their food signs really catch your attention. If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest  this place for you. You can even bring your family if you wish as their buffet prices are very reasonable. I have been here 3 or 4 times already and I have not regretted one of them."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the customer service was two thumbs down. It took foreverrrr to get a refill on our drinks!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst! Buffet in vegas. The service was horrible even at the door when you pay, i had food in my soda floating under the ice,. When i got up to get food, i grabbed a plate and once i did i felt something mooshy it was rice, on suppose to be clean plates! The table was sticky, the food wasnt bad just the overall experience was horrible. The one star is just for the food."}
{"text":"Horrible it's smell horrible it was super dirty worse food experience ever"}
{"text":"Large selection of dishes to choose from. The food doesn't really standout. It was average. Take only what you can eat."}
{"text":"I haven't been about giving the half star, but I feel like I can run between 3 and 4 stars with this place.  It was before the airport and it was Vegas, so you know we were beat.  But it was nice to get away from the strip, take a romp in the desert and see what life really is like in Nevada. And we found Buffet Asia. Our my friend's family introduced us to Buffet Asia. The selection was generous, they had almost everything. They tried their hand at sushi, chicken strips, pizza, BBQ pork, steamed buns, orange chicken, miso soup... anything under the sun. Basically, any food that you have seen Asian-ized, they have it. It's been noted that their selections revolve and they offer a huger seafood selection, then they do regularly.  By buffet standards, I would go here. The food is not great, but it's good. It serves it's purpose, you get what you came for and you do definitely leave full. Service as to be expected, is uninspired and borderline rude... but when you are dealing with hungry people who are getting full... couldn't you smile? Cultured people could bypass this by supplying tips, I'm sure. You are lucky that you don't have to deal with them on a regular basis... and you get your own food.  There were signs on the wall saying \"If you waste food, extra charge will be applied.\" That was not the case, here... let me tell you."}
{"text":"At first site this place looks scary. I was hesitant to eat here and almost got up and left but I decided to stay because the food stations looked clean and I didn't want to be rude. The service was neither good nor bad. They had sushi, Chinese food, pizza, seafood soup, oysters, crab legs, and lots of fruit. I really wanted salad but their salad bar was nonexistent. Most of the food labels were wrong so I had to guess. lol This restaurant is messy and uninviting. I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't be coming back unless I'm on a budget. It's very cheap and it has decent food but they should try harder to keep up with appearance. It doesn't seem like the owner gives a F**k! lol Oh! Thai tea was included in the buffet price as a drink option. I appreciated that because I'm not a fan of soda."}
{"text":"I can def say that this place is good the quality of food is 5x better than some other buffets I have been to. The best part of this buffet is they had CEVICHE, mmmmm... I love Ceviche. It was almost perfect, with the spice kick it had. I mean it was really good. The only thing it needed more of was shrimp.  The place is clean I was so close to the bathroom that it was kind of uncomfy.   Other thank the bathroom situation. They have a wide variety of Sea food.  You know I tried at least one of everything just to get a feel for it. The servers are awesome.   ps they serve Thai Tea"}
{"text":"My experience is slightly different than other reviews that I read. I have eaten at Chinese buffets all over the country and I find this one subpar even with the price acceptance. The hygiene standards are very off-putting. The dining room floor is obviously not cleaned on a daily basis and I'm curious if it's even cleaned on a weekly basis. The bathroom are disgusting. Even the door leading into the bathroom is covered in Grime. It looks like a door that I would see at an employee restroom at a garage or tire shop that is not used by the public. Inside the bathroom reeks of urine and has obviously not been fully cleaned in a very long time. It is a shame, because the bathroom itself would not take very much to get it up to standards. I found the food selection unusually Limited 4 a buffet. The one redeeming quality I found personally was the soups  I thought will well done. I will concede that soup is one of the hardest Foods to mess up. My experience with the wait staff was Pleasant, as they were friendly and kept my beverages topped off. Overall I was disappointed and in the end a little worried.  I have nothing against greasy spoons, but the hygiene standards I witnessed leave me wondering if I will spend this evening in the bathroom. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every time I visit Las Vegas. How many places have all you can eat lobster? The oysters are really good as well. The sushi is pretty standard as far as Asian buffets go. They serve boba here, but I haven't had the chance to actually try it out."}
{"text":"Where else can you go and have unlimited lobsters, crabs, freshly made sushi, oysters for $14.95? I think this place is one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. The Wynn buffet is awesome, but the price is way too high. Normally, my friends would dine there during lunch for a little over $8 bucks, drink included. But if you're really into sea food, go there for the weekend dinner, which has oysters, lobsters, crabs, etc... Base my past experiences, the best time to eat there would be on Saturday, because that's when everything is so fresh (I think older stuff would probably be gone after Friday dinner). And sunday, because it's a all day dinner buffet, you may experience stuff sitting out for too long and therefore won't taste as good. For all out of towners, you gotta try this. For peep in LV, try it once in a while, b/c eating too much of this stuff = high cholesterol and weight gain ..lol."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to go dine out with family. The workers there are amazing, they are quick to refill drinks when needed. The food is delicious and will have you coming for more! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service. They rush you to get out quick Your not quite finish and they pull your plate away and said THANK YOU !!!! Never coming back"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas at least once a year and I'm a huge fan of buffets, Especially this one. They've got a lot of variety and the prices for lunch and dinner are pretty cheap compared to buffets on the strip. However, if you are staying at a hotel on the strip, this place is kinda far, but well worth it. And they always always always have good ass king crab legs, but I heard its only on Fridays now?"}
{"text":"For most Angelinos, Las Vegas is a little like the playground that's just a few blocks away.  More and more the Las Vegas strip is going Asian.  Besides the typical China Star Buffet located on the central strip, there are dozens of other oriental options to choose from in Vegas, on and off the strip. To reach the Chinese area travel west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo. The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. There are Chinese seafood restaurants, Dim Sum places, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Korean and even some full fledged Chinese grocery stores, up and down the street. But one of the things I always keep my open for when it comes to Las Vegas, are buffets. And my absolute favorite find was Buffet Asia, a ten minute drive west of Chinatown, just off Sahara on Pleasant Street.  For three days we asked the local Chinese what the best place in town was and uniformly they recommended this place. I was skeptical at first, for one; because in my experience the best Chinese restaurants are never outside of the Chinese area, and two, the name was suspiciously non Chinese (the best places always have weird translations like ABC Seafood). But Buffet Asia was the real thing. The buffet set us back about $15 for adults and half that for kids on a Saturday night, this place was well worth it, starting with a well stocked sushi table, abundant in tuna, salmon, clam and eel sushi plus some very creative rolls. Following that are the soups (wonton, miso, hot & sour, and egg drop corn), not as good as made-to-order but for a buffet they were excellent. But don't fill up on those items because next comes the many traditional main dishes, like snow crab legs (both steamed and fried in garlic), orange chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, oysters, frogs legs, spicy green beans, Chinese vegetables in sauce and many more. My favorites were the clams in black bean, the soy sauce fish, and the lobster in supreme sauce. By the time I was done with all that I was stuffed, and I hadn't even gone to the Mongolian barbeque yet, which offered fresh (not frozen) meats and seafood including thick cut Korean style short ribs, squid steaks, and fresh shrimp. Tea, non-alcoholic drinks, and dessert are included in the price.  So if you are tired of the same old food in Las Vegas and you don't want to break the pattern by breaking the bank at one of the name restaurants on the strip, then I recommend a trip into the interior to check out the local Chinese fare. It turned out to be a real treat for me."}
{"text":"A good place to come if you want a variety of Asian food to eat.   I came here several times during the 2 years I lived in Vegas. Not my number one place to come, but it was a good choice when I was craving some Asian food.   Looking at the building from the outside, you wouldn't think this place would be any good. The building is very old and outdated. The inside also is old. Old tables that wabble and benches that have holes in the seats and are loose. Flooring is old and looks as though it has never been replaced. The decor is old and not very tasteful. It's like they didn't put any effort into making the atmosphere very inviting.   Putting that aside, they have LOTS of food to choose from at this buffet! They have stuff from noodles, rice, lots of different meats, sushi, salad, fruit, desserts, American food like pizza, chicken nuggets, fries, etc. I'm not one to venture outside of what I know when it comes to food, so I pretty much didn't have any of the meat except for chicken and fish. If you want fresh and hot food, come when they first open. They do continue to refill pans with food during the day, but sometimes I've been here and food has been sitting for awhile so it's gotten dried out and not so tasty anymore. Also, if you want crab legs or shrimp, come and get it right when you get there as there are so many people that don't think of others and fill plates upon plates of just those items. I've hardly ever been able to get shrimp or crab legs cause no sooner they refill it, and the pans are empty!!   The staff here aren't friendly at all. They do clean off the dirty empty dishes and refill your drinks, but other then that, they don't smile or talk to you."}
{"text":"So some notes here. This location is much cleaner than the other one on Sahara.... price is less than the on on Sahara and also open 30 minutes later than Sahara location. All in all check this one out over Sahara location!  Pretty good eats if you want variety of food. Enough to get us full.   The dessert here is lacking need something better for a buffet. Just a cone machine and a few odds and ends.. few like they could do better.   The staff isn't to keen on making sure everything is perfect. We ran out of butter and they put a whole stick in the container and said we had to wait for it to melt. Well we tried to but it took forever."}
{"text":"Uhh, wow. 15 bucks for what is quite possibly the worst buffet I've ever had in my life.   Smallest crab legs I've ever seen, all fried foods were over fried, too much oil used in chow mien and fried rice.  The only thing remotely edible was the Mongolian grill and even that was rather limited.    Steer clear people, spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool"}
{"text":"5 stars ..People please be aware that this is an inexpensive Chinese buffet. There is NO ambience and basic-level customer service. What there is: really good food -- kinda greasy but you want it like that!! A big selection , oh and did I mention it's under $10 lunch and $14  dinner? I can't even get a cocktail for less than $14 on the strip. Oh and btw I got hospital grade food poisoning from the \"high-end\" Paris buffet, and I never had so much as a stomach-ache from this \"dirty\" food. Context, people. Oh, and all-you can eat soft shell crab and crab legs for dinner. So the person who wants to \"cook at home\" above, good luck finding soft shell crab for $15. Not a must try, but this place is goooooodddd and cheap. And the sushi is also good!!"}
{"text":"Too bad zero isn't a score! The food here was horrible! We saw one of the workers using his bare hand to pat down the fried rice. The sushi looked like it has been sitting out all day. The crab legs tasted like salty water."}
{"text":"A combination of food that only just met my expectations and service that severely disappointed, forced me to deliver a 2-star rating.   They sat us in the back corner of the restaurant tucked next to where the soda dispenser and the dish cart are. The fact that they sat us here was one thing, but they were uncomfortably unaccommodating when I asked to move.  After several minutes of awkwardly standing in the middle of the restaurant searching for a new table, we finally found one near our original seat.   This immediate poor experience could have been redeemed if the food was overwhelmingly delicious, but unfortunately that was not the case. The chicken was chewy and the sushi was served dangerously lukewarm. Other than those two items, most of the food was just mediocre. There was nothing tasty enough to drive me back to eat here again.   Buffet at Asia is a great place to go if you are comfortable with dealing with poor service while receiving mediocre food. I would not recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the employees were very rude. One employee yelled that she doesn't speak English at another person when she asked for something. Not a welcoming vibe."}
{"text":"I like this place. It is quite authentic and I know authentic, trust me.  Okay, they have some of the funky things fo the Western palate, but they have geat Clams, steamed fish, ox tail soup, and fried frog legs. You gotta be geat to have this stuff, and this place is one of my favorites to go to when I can't make it downtown.  Lots of Asians dine here, which means it is good."}
{"text":"Forgot how good it was. Had a doctor's appointment near by. After he told me that I had lost a few pounds and my cholesterol tests were normal I decided to check myself into the Asian buffet. Still great for late lunch till 4 pm. $8.99 Can't beat it with a stick."}
{"text":"I came to try Buffet Asia because some one had recommended the place. It was about 1 o'clock on Sunday and to my surprise the place was packed.  That's generally a good sign, so I decided to give it a chance.  Well, I have to honestly say that I was not all that impressed. The place did look clean, there was a wide variety of food, however the food was just The run-of-the-mill Chinese food.  I personally think it was Packed because there was a lot of food, but not necessarily because of the quality of the food.  I paid $10, and that's exactly the quality of food I received. It's good for a quick meal but I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Never been a fan at buffet Asia. The food is ok. The iced tea is what I call tea not so much ice and it is always hot in there (The one on Flamingo is even worse in my opinion). The few bright spots are that the drinks are included and the service is above average."}
{"text":"Totally worth it, I did dinner. salmon & tuna sashimi, many different sushi rolls, large oysters, fried shrimp, steak, white fish, beef & broccoli, chicken skewers, orange chicken, seasoned grilled shrimp, + tons more, was alot of great food to choose from & food was constantly filled up, all the food I tasted was delicious, 2 workers constantly creating sushi rolls, workers all over picking up plates & refilling food, waiter gave fast drink refills.  u can tell they're used to being packed - most tables were full. will definitely go there alot!!!!!   i asked what is difference between dinner and lunch and they said more seafood available during dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great food and the price is right! Everything is always fresh. I would definitely come here again. There is a great mix of things from popular asian foods and seafood. They actually open at 10:30 AM even though they're listed at 11AM."}
{"text":"To be fair, you can't go wrong here if you're looking for price... it's a $10 lunch buffet.   Everything was pretty tasty but the food quality and upkeep of the facility fits the price... if that makes sense. Just one of those things you can tell if you work in the industry or you've eaten out at enough places or just have five working senses.  Also docked a star because my friend ordered a drink and never got it and I never got my coffee because apparently \"coffee service ended\" and it was 11 am. I'll keep my snarky comments to myself on that one.  Three and a half stars but rounded down for subpar service on this one."}
{"text":"Service is an A.   Food tastes much better/fresher/cleaner than other Chinese buffets in town.   Low price.   There are separate dinning rooms apart from the food stations, which makes the experience more enjoyable.   Recommend oxtail soup and green beans :')"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times ever since i've heard of this place.  I've always been at lunch time tho.  The food variety is really good in my opinion. And the sushi they serve is good too. The price for it all during lunch is reasonable.  My only huge con about this place is that a few times my waiters would take foreverrr to fill up my table's drinks. And i know they saw our table because i would watch them until they fill it up. So the service there is pretty crappy. They really need to fix that :P  Another con is their booth chairs. Alot of them have a deep dent in it and it makes me feel creeped out and uncomfortable to sit on them. The last time i went there, they had gotten new cushions for their booth chairs, however they were a little bit stiff and hard.  Overall, i still eat atleast once every two months. I can overlook the cons a bit; so i still go there since the asian restaurant closest to my house sucks big time!"}
{"text":"Buffet @ Asia is a place that has never peaked my interest until recently when a family member raved about their Sunday dinner.      Come Sunday, and you have three ravenous individuals who just came from biking outside in the 107 degree Vegas weather.  (Yeah, we're crazy.)  We walked in around 5 pm, and there's already a line.  Straight to the register, $15.99/pp (adults) and we're seated at a table.    There's a Mongolian BBQ station - you pick your veggies and meat and they cook it up on this giant flat stove thing for you.  (We all skipped this, which might explain why we never saw the kalbi short ribs everyone else talked about. Damn.)  Sushi - They have a bunch of random rolls with lots of sauce and stuff and some salmon sashimi.  That was something we all avoided as well.  Seafood - green mussels, baked scallops (my friend wasn't sure if there was scallop in there b/c they mix it up with stuff and cover it up with sauce), jumbo hot shrimp (old), cooked cold shrimp (fresh, and not overly cooked - over by the salad bar section), oysters on the half shell (big ones - okay, a bit too 'milky' for me), lobster, salt and pepper crab (not the freshest), snow crab legs (we mostly ate this and a lot of it, with drawn butter), deep-fried frog legs (old), deep-fried calamari (okay), baked salmon, clams (pretty good), and I'm sure a few other things I overlooked.  (There was no crawfish though, unfortunately!)  Cooked items - stir-fried strings beans (I ate a lot of this), mixed veggies with shrimp, beef and broccoli, fried rice, steamed rice, asparagus, potstickers (skin was old), crab ragoons, eggrolls, deep-fried chicken wings, etc.  Soup - wonton soup, oxtail soup, egg drop soup.  Dessert - fresh fruit and marshmallows for dipping into chocolate, egg custard tarts (blah), almond cookies, soft serve, almond jello with fruit cocktail, mango mousse, sesame balls, malasadas (would be better if they were hot), tapioca, and a few other things.  Service is super attentive, especially in clearing plates.  They greet you right away with beverage orders and it's not to hard to wave them down for refills, extra napkins, shell crackers, etc.  Overall, you really can't complain about the price.  We went on one of their more expensive nights and I think we had enough crab to definitely surpass our money's worth.  You have to wonder how they even turn a profit.  Some of the food is just blah, but at least you can have a taste and never get more.  And then there's a handful of things that will have you returning for more.  It works for picky eaters too.  Their menu seems to be changing all the time, so you never know what you're gonna get!  I've had better buffets (that cost more), and worse Asian ones too.  They obviously are doing something right because there's a lot of people dining here."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good for an Asian buffet. I've been to few and this has been so far the best"}
{"text":"I use to go here regularly, but my last visit will prevent any future consideration. Everything I liked about this place is nonexistent to include cleanlines, run down, greasy, overcooked, not fresh, over all poor, very poor. I have felt this way about this place for about a year now. The last straw is my wife and I throwing up everything we ate shortly after getting home. there are many points I could address about all the food on that buffet but, rather then be so insanely negative, I strongly suggest you protect your health and go else where. Makinos is 100x better in every way and then some. This place needs a serious reality check. I would be embarrassed to work there. I am hoping they lose enough business to shutdown and cleanup, get their act together and then reopen. Until then, they don't exist to me. I have been a loyal customer for far too long. Maybe the rainbow location is better, I will let you know. One star because a rating is required. Zero stars really should be an option."}
{"text":"Lots of food choices, seafood is usually good.  However, they seem to overlook a lot of things, making them hard and tough.  The Seafood Toast is really good, and the Salt and Pepper Crab, but I avoid the Jslepeno Chicjen, I love hit food, but that chicks cray cray.  Thru have Boba Tea and some coffee drinks, which I haven't tried yet, but look good.  The cashier ALWAYS looks to see if you've added a tip, and gets a sour look. We tip after not before."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a $13.00 dinner buffet?  This is not your super intense high end buffet and sometimes you just want to  stick with a place that works.  Sushi is pretty good and my son always goes for whatever is being made to order - in this case the mongolian barbecue got a workout.   Lots of shrimp dishes, fresh shucked oysters, sashimi (mostly leftovers from the sushi), several soups and more.  The place is clean.  If you are out towards Henderson, this would be a good pick."}
{"text":"Unfortunate. I would recommend staying away from this place. The restaurant is not particularly clean, and the food is very sub par on many fronts; quality, taste and sitting time are a few points. Food from any mainstream fast good restaurant is about twice the quality."}
{"text":"Every time my family and I visit Vegas we somehow always end up here. Two things that are constantly good: Ox Tail Soup (only available at dinner) and sushi (really!). I also enjoy the fact that each diner gets to choose a steak or lamb chop made to order. They are not out-of-this-world steak and lamb chop but a buffet restaurant offering that is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"EH. Las Vegas, the LAND OF BUFFETS.  Living here it's hard to avoid having to go to a buffet for department lunches celebrating birthdays.  I typically opt out in attending because there are only so much buffet eateries you can stomach in Vegas.  This month just so happens to be my birthday month so needless to say, I was obligated to go.   Oh how I wish they just stuck to the Santa Fe or Rampart casino buffet (not the greatest but still better) instead of this place---Buffet @ Asia.  I've been to the one in Henderson before with the folks and it was slightly above average.  This one....for $6.99.  Just take yourself to Whackdonald's and get yourself a big mac meal.  Maybe it's just me and Asian Buffets, who knows.  I have a thing for cleanliness and this one doesn't live up to my standards.  The food is relatively mediocre but what do you expect for all you can eat $6.99, right?  I'm hoping dinner here is much savory than lunch."}
{"text":"Been here only 3 times or so, i fell in love with the Lettuce Wrap. Gotta try those rice balls too, this place is incredibly unique compared to the strips' restaurants, buffets and California's Asian buffets. We need a branch in Southern Cali!"}
{"text":"Service sucks,( but that's normal), seating in the dining room sucks too.  However I've never had a problem with their actual food. It's hot, fresh, rotated, great sushi selection and quality compared to the other location on rainbow and sahara.   The atomosphere is old and worn though."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill more and more.  Service has NEVER been good here, the food has always been fine but the quality of food is changing.  It has become more bland and the sushi selection although it's large, it's actually all the same thing (it just LOOKS different)  Believe it or not, Krazy Buffet just up the street is a little better and definitely better priced.    Yes this place is always packed (maybe too much) it's hard to get around the buffet lately, it's over crowded and the quality isn't the same.   I think this may be my last time coming over here."}
{"text":"Food....not good...  place... so dirty!!! I will not come back unless Im desperate for a chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Simply put, if you can't afford to eat at nice buffet and wish to enjoy crab, this is the place. Othewise skip this place since the crab tasted like mash potatos and all though they don't run out of food, the customers grab all they can get as soon as they bring the crab or lobster out. Food tasted like 2nd or 3rd day left overs and hate to say it. I tend to give great reviews to places that I enjoy and this is not one of them.  My friend that took me there keep telling me that the food is great for the price and I was thinking well I guess if you are hungry enough, you can eat out of garbage cans and the cost would be great also. I would not return to this place to eat because I rather eat white rice by itself then the food they serve.  Sorry for the bad review, I'm sure there are tons of people that enjoy the value but once you know what food supposed to taste like, it's hard to go back to this type of buffet."}
{"text":"One of our to go restaurant when we are lazy to cook and super hungry. This place always have the freshest stuff and great bang for your buck. Love the lunch item, although service is like any other asian restaurant but we come here for the food not the service. Its a buffet!!! Come on!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Less than $10 per person. Had a nice selection of food. Good desserts."}
{"text":"This place got me sick! I was so disgusted and they dont say an y thing when they see people literally eating while grabbing food. The customer service is terrible i didnt get a refill til 20 minutes after i almost choked on my food trying to get a damn server to bring me a refill. The ribs the one th in ng i was craving the most got me really disgusted, they were hard and didnt even have a good bbq taste. This  place is a rip off...and the food isnt even worth the pay...DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU'RE PICKY WITH UR FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"If you are craving Chinese buffet, this is not the place that I would recommend. Sure, there is a large variety of items to choose from.  However, the food is terrible.  Some of the items seemed to be on the inedible side.  I wouldn't have gone here for several reasons, if it were not because it is a mecca for tour bus and there were no other restaurants in the same shopping center.  1) The price for Sunday lunch was too expensive.  $14.99 for Sunday buffet?  That's outrageous.  2) The service.  They obviously could not handle a sudden rush of folks.  That's the unusual part as I am sure that tour buses stop here at least once a week. 3) I would have chosen to eat for the same or cheaper price at a off the strip buffet restaurant.  And 4) The A/C wasn't on.  With the weather outside in the 90's.  Are you crazy?  BTW, I ate at this restaurant two months ago.  The only reason that I still remember the dreadful experience is that it is in Las Vegas, one of the buffet meccas."}
{"text":"It's a good value for the price you pay for the quality of food, it's hard to beat dinner for $14 which includes a drink!  Clams, shrimp, tom yum, seafood mix, crab, crayfish, and sushi are included!  Keep in mind, the quality is only ok, not the best in how it was prepared but it's not bad either (too greasy for me).  Service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant.  You will have to pay first before sitting down."}
{"text":"For $16.50 per person for dinner, you'd expect them to serve at least McDonald's level soft-serve   (although that may be too high a standard). Regardless, the texture did not make it look appetizing. Small particle-like ice cream so sweet you'd marry it. Everything is just glistening with oil. The fried rice had no seasoning and the clams had sand in them. The sushi was dry, but everything, I suppose, was edible.  Aside from the food, I think the worst part of my dining experience were the owners. I can't help, but feel they only want my money and customer satisfaction isn't relevant anymore. For large parties, they add a 20%  tip onto the total bill, but offer free drinks. To get around this, my party split into smaller groups.   I may be a tad harsh since the food IS there to fill you up. That's a buffet. Bland, tasteless options everywhere. Maybe it's me, but I'd like to imagine otherwise."}
{"text":"I'm confused on how this place can get 2 1/2 stars.  You get way more then you pay for. And you're in and out in no time. Plus they have buy one beer get one free... Ummm what do people expect for $15 ... However the Servers look sooo sad all the time. So please tip. lol"}
{"text":"Many choices, lots of people. Sushi is fresh, they take there sweet time putting out crab legs"}
{"text":"This was the only place after church nearby that can reserve about 30 seats quickly and I'm always pretty excited going to a restaurant I have never tried before.    Arriving at the place to park, in my mind I was like WTF? Is this an Asian Buffet or an outdoor market in Tijuana, Mexico? Peeps all up in my grill tryin' to sell me oranges at the back of trucks, stands selling necklaces, beads, and all sort of other home made jewelry. Come on Buffet of Asia, get this crap out of your parking lot if you wanna attract business!  But then again it's not the nicest location so I wasn't surprised.  It is not the greatest looking restaurant and most will probably pass by it without ever giving it thought but for what it is, it's a pretty decent buffet with a big selection.  Here's what I found good in there: Beef Pepper, Fried Squid, Oysters, Scallops, Chicken Jalapeno, Ribs, Sea Food Salad and some sort of fried crispy crab.  Please stay away from the sushi unless you wanna be like me taking a deuce (sh*t) several times in a public restroom which I do my best to avoid unless it's a real emergency like this night was. Even playing angry birds on my iphone couldn't get my mind how disgusted I was using a public restroom to take a deuce with my conscience repeatedly saying how much I regret in eating those sushi!   The crowd inside is a mixture of \"Fresh off the Border\" Hispanics and \"Fresh off the Boat\" Asians. This is not the place where you would want to bring a date and because of the fact that its kinda dirty with loud ass people.  Especially these group of filipinos. Loud ass hell, laughing off the top of their lungs, and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways. Sadly I'm talking about my group of friends haha, the group of girls we have with us are always the loudest everywhere we go.    It's $15 a person, so if you come out disappointed, at least you didn't pay much for a buffet.  I wouldn't mind coming here again but if I get sick again, it's gonna be on my sh*t list and I mean that in a literal sense since it made me take a sh*t.  Why a 3 star instead of a 2? Because I should have known better not to eat sushi in places like this.  My dumb ass experimented with 7-11 sushi too.  You think I would have learned my lesson from that before."}
{"text":"Super crummy buffet AND they charge leftover wasted food... If the food was actually good, maybe there wouldn't be any wasted food!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I knew this had to be a really dirty place. And I was not wrong. I went to wash my hands only to find the DIRTIEST bathroom I've ever seen. I lost my appetite after that. Pretty sure there's a lot of health violations.   If the bathroom was this dirty, I don't even want to imagine how dirty the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The ambiance was a bit dirty but hey, it's a chinese place; what' s new. I am so glad l didnt try ANY OF THE RAW meat kinda dish by the front door. There were FLIES HOVERING over it and possibly landed on it without anyone noticing it. Gross ! Should have snapped a pix of it. Know where flies' feet walk on ?"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant has four locations in Vegas. This one seems to charge more between the lunch and dinner options. I paid almost 11.00 more to eat here when it's 10.99 per adult at the other locations.    This hostess was not friendly at all. She allowed someone else to cut the line while we were patiently  waiting.  The time was 3:32 pm and she says dinner starts at 3:45. Not explaining the reason for such a price diffrence. I paid 36.64 for two with soft drinks and don't even eat seafood. So this was a total waste of money. In the future I will NEVER BE COMING HERE AGAIN. I rather go to the other locations just to save a few bucks. Thus place is lucky I gave them a two star rating. The cashier needs a class in customer service."}
{"text":"Obviously it's a buffet so they use very very low quality ingredients I can't imagine anything being worse than this in terms of Chinese food."}
{"text":"It smells pretty bad when you walk in. Food looks like it's been out for awhile. Cleanliness is a zero!"}
{"text":"This place sucks monkeys balls. We have tried all locations in Vegas and this is nothing like the other 2 locations. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Worst buffet EVER!  Was in town visiting some friends & when I told them where we ate they were speechless.  Well come to find out my friends husband delivers to their business & said that place is full of RODENTS!!  So glad I didn't eat much."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and it is used primarily for a large food intake at a cheap price after a long hike. So that being said I am not expecting the best.  Exterior: The building itself actually looks appealing and in good condition. There is a large parking lot so finding a space is usually not a problem. It's cross streets are Rainbow and Sahara, it is next to a diner which I will try soon.  Interior: When you open the first set of double doors there are a few coin operated toy machines to get your last couple quarters due to the kids nagging. After the second set of double doors you are inside the restaurant, the counter to your left is where you pay and get taken to your table from. The dining area is large and has a couple separate rooms so you don't feel overcrowded. There are 6 food serving areas in the middle of the buffet containing various food items to choose from, there is a long service area containing fruit and desserts with an ice cream machine next to it, there is another long service area containing a good variety of sushi, and lastly there is a grill area for all of your Mongolian bbq to be prepared. I heard there is a bar but I have not seen it.  Food: The food is average with nothing to get excited about but for less than $9 you really can't expect the best or complain. The various dishes in the middle of the buffet are usually hot and switched out regularly. The chow mein, chicken with jalapenos, cream cheese rangoon, and sushi is usually what I stick with. The sushi is actually decent for the price and has a lot of rolls to select. I got a spring roll yesterday and it was extremely greasy. I also got some of the butterfly fried shrimp and they were undercooked. Like I said the food is cheap and I will return when the wallet is light.  Service: The service is actually good. I always get seated quickly considering I always want a booth. The staff never let your drinks go empty and are constantly refilling them. Your finished plates are picked up in a timely manner, sometimes you get a glance if you leave a mountain of food like I have a couple times due to not liking it, but they don't charge you for wasting food so that's ok.   I give it 3 stars due to the butterfly fried shrimp being undercooked and for waiting for close to 5 mins for the Mongolian bbq cook to show up, he didn't so I ended up leaving a bowl of uncooked food there."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since the place opened. It's always been tasty and has plenty of options. But several months ago, management took away the Mongolian barbecue section. We haven't been back since. They need to quit bending over backwards for bus tours and serve what locals want. And we want Mongolian barbecue, not a third selection table of sushi. Two tables of sushi are quite enough."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this restaurant 2 days ago and had the worst customer service ever. People were extremely rude and rushy. No one smiled. The lady in the front was extremely rude. I believe that they poisoned us somehow because all of us were throwing up early this morning and that was the last thing all of us had eaten together. If anybody wants to be poisoned go on ahead and eat here"}
{"text":"This place is not for people who is looking for authentic Chinese food. If you are looking for quantity, this is the place to go. If you are looking for quality dinning, you may be disappointed. I came over with a Chinese tour and wish I had saved the money and went to McDonald or any other fast food place."}
{"text":"Value = good Food = decent We only eat here when they have sea food night.  Lot of choice.  Service = terrible ! Terrible! Yet we keep coming back. Lol  We like this place"}
{"text":"Very good quality food and awesome customer service  Minus the waiting time due to it being fathers day which is understable  Overall great experience and will be returning"}
{"text":"The food is good, the customer service is so terrible it's appalling. When we got here they couldn't give us the correct price for a child it seemed that no one knew and they were all asking each other before giving me an answer. The place looks terrible and it is very dirty. They had dirty rags on the floor and on the counter where they had the \"CLEAN SILVERWARE\" I had to ask for different silverware because the one they initially gave me had rice in it. They had a broom and dustpan right next to where I was eating and the waitress was sitting around yawning the entire time. God forbid you ask for napkins, we were a party of five and they gave us three napkins when I asked for the waitress hesitated and gave me attitude when I ask for two more. There was food on the floor and as a waiter passed by instead of picking it up he just kicked it out of the way! The place needs a lot of cleaning it makes for a very bad dinner experience you can't enjoy the food. Overall I give it two stars only because the food is good but it does not make up for the HORRIBLE service and poor, poor job in cleanliness"}
{"text":"We went to this buffet during the state wrestling championship. I do believe that it is a great value, however My review is based on service as well as the cleanup crew. I took my five kids here Because they claimed to have sushi and sashimi as well as other Asian Delights. Food really was good, not how I expected. I don't really like buffets because the food is usually bland/plain and prepared in huge quantities with no personal touch. However this Asian food was similar to a fast food restaurant. The sashimi bar kept running out of salmon and tuna, and I would ask for them to replenish it. I saw a big piles of Artie prepped fish sitting on the counter, so I was not sure why they were not replenishing that fast. I do understand that seven of us were eating mostly so she me, so I gave an extra star for this. However about an hour before closing, they decided to start cleaning the floors. There was this huge horrible chlorine smell that start making us nauseous as we were trying to eat. Also the bucket water had a specific smell that you only smell when it's not changed often enough. I'm not sure how they figure that it's OK to sanitize the floors with smelly water while customers are sitting in booth next to the cleaner.    I will go back to this place, however I will make sure it's early enough to miss the inconsiderate buckets of chlorine."}
{"text":"We tried this buffet as part of a Chinese tour we hopped on from LA to Antelope Canyon. It was just okay. Not great, but edible. Even though it's decent, everything is very salty and dry. Even the fruits tasted dry. There are definitely better buffet places out there than this one, and if we had a choice we would probably skip this place. However, it was our only option on the tour because the guides have to take us to a Chinese buffet as 90% of passengers were Chinese tourists who only want to eat at these types of places.  This place is cash only, but if there is low demand, they take in credit card holders for a fee.  Parking is free and plenty because it is in a plaza with other businesses nearby."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food you get for the price you pay. Lunch is $9 everyday. Drinks (including Thai iced teas w/ free refills) are $0.95. They have really good ox tail soup and their meat is good. It's worth it if you're hungry and lost all your money in the casinos."}
{"text":"I think I came here when I was still fasting so was not able to try all the food option.  From what I remember the value was good for the food they offer.  Will definitely be back again to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Let's be real. All Filipinos have been here at least once. Haha. Not the best but definitely not the worst \"asian\" buffet when you're hungry, frugal and on the run. It's decent food with several selections.   I personally don't come often when I do, I leave stuffed! They have several types of meats, veggies, sushi, soups and desert! Some items have the same \"taste\"   I think every location needs a deep, deep cleaning as most places are older and just needs a good scrub down.   Other than that overall okay. Staff is usually always very nice."}
{"text":"This place was once a great p place to eat. Now, no matter which location I tried over several months, the food is just bad. Nothing like the variety and taste of years past. It tastes bland or full of garlic. Chow mein is mushy and they don't serve the dishes that they once did.   I kept hoping it would taste like the old days.  No more tries! I guess it's why they keep closing locations."}
{"text":"We came here on a sunday night before closing, 9pm. They discounted our meal bc after 9 the chefs stop cooking. 2 AYCE (14 each) + free Soda for 28 (usually $14.99+1.29)   - Salmon, octopus and eel nigiri were there. fish pieces were fair size. - I love soups. their wanton soup, egg soup, and hot and sour soups were pretty good. still hot. - crab legs and lobster were a bit flavorless. shells were soft. expected for a $15 buffet. - must flavor own oysters! O___O - other items i ate: potstickers, cream cheese wantons, orange chicken, salt and pepper dungeness, shrimp and mushrooms,  - desserts didn't look appetizing, but then again, i don't care much for them at an asian buffet.  - i appreciate that they discounted our meal. kind service. gave us extra drinks and lots of napkins in advance."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening, a little before 8pm, and had their dinner buffet for  31.54 (Used a 15% off dinner coupon that I received in the mail)   - Right before we walked in 2 Asian men came out arguing about Lobster! Literally, \"Let's take this outside!\" Hot commodity. YES!  - Pay before you eat like a casino buffet.  Items to grab a second time 1. salmon sashimi  2. Lobster - like at a dim sum restaurant 3. Prawns - like at Makinos 4. Crab legs  - Disorganized seating.  - Like most Asians, you come for the seafood. They do have the normal Chinese buffet food and the sushi rolls that no one gets. Fillers.  - No dim sum. No tempura.  - Oysters taste just like the sea...yuck. Good thing they have lemons and chili paste. - Exactly what I expected. Great food, sloppy venue. If you can get over that, then you'll have a wonderful time.  - Full-filling. Cheap. No dates. Family + Bring GM+GF type of place. You challenge yourself to AYCE, then leave with that  greasy upset stomach feeling. haha"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good service and welcoming smile, do not come here. This restaurant is just like any other Asian buffet restaurant. Although I will admit that their sushi selection is a little bit better and bigger than other places, the other food selections are not that diverse. I didn't try their desserts, but those options seemed average or a little below that as well. Some of their good food selections that caught my eye though were the ribs and the crab legs. Overall, I would not come back unless someone else wanted to. But the cheap price here is always nice, and the fact that they include refillable beverages is awesome. They consistently though bring out fresh and hot food, which is nice to see too!"}
{"text":"This place has no customer service at all! Waited at the Mongolian BBQ station to order, rang the bell as the sign said! No one came around! There was a guy making sushi there but just looked at me never said nothing! This is last time I come here!"}
{"text":"Good food, well priced but tables are old and restrooms are dirty. Needs polish up!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap/decent Asian buffet in Vegas, this is the place for you. Went here to Vegas in the month of June and my local friends took me to this spot because (of course) they know i love Asian Food.   Its hard to miss the giant (neon at night) Buffet Asia sign on the outside of the restaurant. We went during the lunch rush but it was very easy to find parking and seats. They have sooooo many options of asian food available. Soups, sushi, BBQ, noodles, and Seafood. I think the seafood was my favorite part. I was excited they had crawfish available.   However, in a town full of buffets this is just A-ok for me. It is true, they do have many choices of entrees,  but the quality was just okay as well. I just wish they had more dessert choices available, It would've completed the menu.   For the price you pay, you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Wow Where do I start well food was awful only thing good is the Mongolian place where they make you the food,I asked for water for my son and we got it with 2 flies stuck on the side of the glass inside I ask her can we got a clean glass she looks at me and said how come and I showed her and she put her hand and pulled it out I was like wow really that's so nasty I can't believe you just did that in front of me she just looked at me last but not least the service was awful it seems like they have an attitude every time I would ask for something and asking for refills for me and my husbands drinks was a task for them they were slamming the glass and saying something in their language at one point I asked if she was okay and she just looked at me.bottom line is I would never come back and I would never recommend them to anybody."}
{"text":"I do like this place!!! Only thing is sometimes its abit salty but WOW is it good~"}
{"text":"HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 3 STARS?!! The food taste like oil, there's absolutely no flavor, and everything taste like it's been frozen thawed out, frozen, and then thawed out again. I took one bite of the fried shrimp and literally gagged and spit it out in my napkin. I had the spicy shrimp and I was able to stomach a few pieces. The orange chicken tasted so gamey, I spit that out in a napkin too. The crab is a joke, straight water tasting, and was soggy if crab could even be soggy?! I know this place is cheap, but I wouldn't eat at this place even if someone paid me too. THE BATHROOMS ARE DISGUSTING! STRAIGHT FILTHY! Cakes of grime and dirt all over the stalls. I could only imagine what the kitchen looks like. DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Even the Chinese buffet in Chadron, Nebraska was better than this. Don't even be tempted."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Do NOT waste your money here. My boyfriend and I would come here understanding it isn't a gourmet style strip buffet...but the food is not anywhere near fresh and will make you sick. Also, their customer service is horrible....hor i ble."}
{"text":"Pretty good considering it seems like an average sort of buffet. Saw no seaweed salad though and the server seemed to have no clue what I was referring to, but perhaps they have it regularly and were just out that day. It was a slow Monday.  If anything, it's worth it for the endless crab legs~ which were only a bit salty, easily washed down with some cocktail sauce.   Would return!"}
{"text":"This use to be a pretty great place to eat. But recently it's gone down hill.   They try to cram as many parties as they can into small rooms. I mean I had people bumping into me as I was eating.   The food is also just one kind. Chicken in varying degrees of spice.   Cleanliness around the food, seem to be mom existant"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying we went on a Sunday around 1 pm and it was very very busy. We had to wait to be seated and once it was time for us to go through the buffet line it was a mad house. It was so busy that the staff couldn't fill some of the popular items fast enough. The food was ok I wouldn't say it was amazing but it truly is like any other Chinese buffet you go to. The part  that concerned me was the cleanliness of this place. The floors are filthy, there are sticky spots to the floor and the tables felt sticky as well. My sushi roll had a piece of plastic wrapper on it as well. The only thing I would recommend they do is to get on their staff to clean instead of standing around."}
{"text":"The cheapest food available for mass consumption. Decent service.  Nothing good to comment about. Other Chinese restaurants will fill you up for less of a cost. Tried one year ago. Now I remember why I didn't go back."}
{"text":"Ate here on my last trip to Vegas and i was surprised by this place. I'm not a fan of Asian buffets like Todai and such but i actually like this one. We came mid-afternoon on a Friday and we had no wait to get seated. The food was fresh and they had a wide variety of food that covered all of the Asian cuisine's.  This will be added to places i must eat at when i return to LV in the future."}
{"text":"We always go for lunch.It's deal for price and portion of food.Service is good enough.Don't expect too much for buffet.Free drink and many choice to pick up."}
{"text":"The waiter likes to comment on the guests together, and the mandatory tip must be tipped first, otherwise it will not be allowed to eat."}
{"text":"Both my parents and my in-laws have some magnetic draw to these particular buffets. The only reason we come to this location is because it's a mid point meeting place for family coming from opposite sides of town. This place used to be OK. But out of the three Buffet @ Asia I've been to, this one is the worst. The price is OK, service is hit or miss, but the food selection and cleanliness have took a turn for the worse.  I'm pretty easy to please, but I was hard pressed to even fill my plate on my three trips. I'm not sure if they got rid of the Mongolian grill, but it wasn't up on our visit and that's always safe for me to go to when I'm in doubt. I grabbed a couple pieces of the sushi rolls and ate one and was done with those for the night. All of the raw food looked like it had been sitting out for a while, so I didn't go near the oysters either. The sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, cream cheese rangoon, and peel and eat shrimp were edible. And I actually liked the asparagus and of course, as always, the doughnuts. Overall, everything looked just cluttered in the restaurant and the food wasn't getting regular rotations at the buffet.  Our server was consistently behind with removing plates and with refills. She also could be a world class poker player as she didn't change her expression or demeanor the whole time we were there.  The bill for our party of 7 was $120 which I prepaid before we ate and included auto gratuity of 12% for parties of 6 and greater. Some in the party were happy but I was unsatisfied. Our family will choose to go Buffet @ Asia again. But I'll just make sure we go to the Rainbow or Eastern location."}
{"text":"This place is good take a group. Especially if that a group is an Asian family. We've been here for dinner on a weeknight with a party of 11 and for Sunday lunch with a party of 10. They have a little bit of everything to satisfy an Asian palate. You also get good bang for your buck when you're feeding that many people.  The Sunday lunch was a great value. We fed all ten of us for under a hundred dollars. They automatically add gratuity (13%) for parties larger than 8. The food is OK. Nothing really stands out, but nothing is really awful.  I'll usually make one trip for sushi, one trip to the Mongolian grill, one trip for whatever seafood (mussels, lobster, or crab) looks good, and one trip for dessert. Keep your eye on the sushi for items that look like they have been sitting around for a while. Luckily for other diners, by the time I head out for dessert, I'm pretty full and can only handle 2-3 Chinese donuts, otherwise, I'd finish off the whole tray myself. The coconut pudding doesn't seem to be big hit with everyone else, but I like it and I'm always good for 2-3 squares of that.  Servers are usually attentive and always present on a regular basis. The restaurant  is usually full and requires careful navigation through the buffet are at times. Everything you'd expect from an Asian buffet."}
{"text":"You really gotta mess up to get one of these ratings from me but I've given up on these guys and all of their locations. After wasting $200 at this place, there's really no reason to return, for any aspect. The food, service, and atmosphere have all declined. Hopefully I can keep you from making the same mistake also.  The last time we were at this location was probably four or five months ago and things seemed OK. Since then, they've taken a nose dive and they're heading for a crash landing. Things were bad from the start when the super personable woman up front greeted us first with, \"how many?\" After tallying the head count at 13, she asked \"how many drinks?\" I was about to say 13, but stopped and asked if they were free and she said they weren't and were $1.50 each. What buffet does that crap for soft drinks?  The Mongolian grill is gone. They sushi stand was ransacked and looked like I fell into after drinking a 12 pack. They time stamp the sushi and saw some pieces that were there since 3:30 PM and it almost 8 when we were there. Pretty much all of the food was old and dried out with no attempt to replace any of it. Their one saving grace has been their crab legs, but my wife gave up on them after one trip because they were overcooked with no meat. My brother-in-law didn't finish his meal because he was getting an upset stomach from eating the chicken wings. Service was terrible for a buffet. Thirteen people are gonna go through plates pretty quick and they were piled up like we were having a tower building contest.  I could go on and on, but I'm not going to waste my time or yours writing, or even uploading photos. Just trust if you look at my rating distribution, no business gets this unless they truly deserve it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is mediocre at best. The food was greasy and unoriginal. Nothing was outstanding and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Asia is the Asian buffet in town, big section IOC Sushi and chinise food, not bad is very good, good peper salted srimp, frie Calamare etc, one of my favorite place to eat Chinise"}
{"text":"You know people talk about this place but you have to come in person to see it is not like people said,i went today for lunch and i eat a littel Sushi, jalapeño Srimp and couple others items, was pritty good and for a quik lunch you choises there, grab eat littel bed of everything Telapia whith ginger Slice bambo black musroom n carrots n Ginger that was good The jalapeño Srimp was good too, four diferent soups plus diferent salds in overall yes go and try it is all right any way in the only best all u can eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food.. Wouldn't recommend it, restrooms are dirty.. The whole experience was a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"So, I pretty much go here every time I'm in Vegas with my incredibly large family, and this is because it's probably one of the cheapest buffets around.  Prices vary depending on age and height (or something like that).  Unfortunately, I didn't pay much attention to the prices because I didn't have to pay.  Har har.  Let's see here ... the food is pretty good I guess.  Nothing extraordinary and nothing that disgusts me.  I'm a vegetarian so there weren't many options for me.  I ate the Chow Mein, Saunteed Mushrooms, Fried String Beans with Garlic.  Furthermore, a couple of chocolate strawberries, fruit, and pastries. All of those were okay.  It didn't blow me away ... at all.  The place looks rather nice outside; I wouldn't say the same for the inside.  It doesn't look too clean.  Actually, I can put up with the look, but it's not exactly attractive.  So to sum things up; it's average. Call it a plain jane place if you want."}
{"text":"I found Buffet @ Asia (so hip with their \"L33T Speak\") to be merely okay.  Nothing exceptional, but a decent selection.  A few observations I noticed while here:  While they did have a fairly diverse sushi line-up, regardless of the fish on top, or the sauces added, there was always the following three things inside each roll regardless: Cucumber, avocado, and crab.  Usually not bad, but it honestly made up the contents of each roll.  The hot and sour soup was not a great experience.  It was largely tasteless, other than there was a bit of hotness left tingling in your mouth.  I don't mind hot/spicy things, but when eating soup, I'd like for there to be a few other flavors involved other than \"I don't taste anything, yet my lips are tingling\".  I also noticed that some fellow named \"Bil\" took great pride in writing and carving his name all over the men's bathroom, going as far as to carve his name into the toilet seat.  I wonder if \"Bil\" really thought it through when he would eventually claim ownership of the results of people's bathroom visitations, but if it somehow helps to build his personal empire in ways that I simply cannot comprehend, then more power to him.  ....  I guess.  The servers were good about removing plates, and the price isn't bad.  They have a Mongolian BBQ section, so big points for that, but I decided to attempt that for another visit.  For what it is, it's not bad, but the hot and sour soup is useless, and don't expect a lot of diversity in sushi choices there.  UPDATE: As of July 2009, \"Bil\" has been removed from the bathroom walls!  His empire has crumbled, and undoubtedly, those oppressed by his iron rule have been set free.  For the rest of you, you can do your business in peace without fear of claimage by \"Bil\".  I can only hope that his short-lived rule found enough glory for the historic archives of bathroom kingdoms.  (Sushi is still about the same)."}
{"text":"Buffet @ Asia is a little inconsistent with the service.  The policies can be very unclear, for example my father has a medical condition that does not allow him to eat very much at once and in the past they would allow him to purchase an ala cart take out box to eat while we dine, that way when he's full he can take the rest home.   When we went for dinner earlier this week, we were told you were only allowed to purchase a take out box once you leave, which contradicts what we've been doing in the past. So basically he wasn't allowed to purchase the take out box and just opted for a regular dine in, an in the end only ate half of one plate which ultimately was a waste of money. I just wish they were more consistent with their policies, as we will no longer be able to eat there as a family.  Other than that, this is an okay buffet that decently priced. I'm a little sketched out that they keep their Health Department grade on a bulletin board, all stacked up against the old ones so it's unclear which one is current.   It can get super packed for dinner so you either get the choice of being squished like sardines with other diners in one of their dining rooms or sitting in the bar area that smells like the bathroom that's on the other side of the wall.   The wings are pretty good, but we mostly come here for the crab legs."}
{"text":"PEOPLE! DO NOT EAT THERE! They are NASTY! I went into the men's room, saw an employee leave out a stall and just walked out! NO HAND WASHING AT ALL! After wards I took the issue to the Manager/Supervisor and she got very indignant with me! She said if I don't know who the employee is, to mind my own business! I said maybe he's in the kitchen...HELLO!!! I told my wife about it and we DID NOT finish our meal. The people there are RUDE, the quality of food SUCK, they have no people skills at all! I was once told by an older Asian man, if the Chinese restaurant is not frequented by Asians...GO SOME WHERE ELSE!  I've made a formal complaint through Clark County Health Department. Hope they do their job for the sake of those still dumb enough to eat there!...."}
{"text":"Been here a 2 times because my roommate likes it (think I need better roommates with finer culinary skills), but I can definitely pass on it. Place is dirty with a poor selection of food. Most of their food in the buffet trays have that 3 hour old film on it, definitely not fresh ... and not the tasty. If I was desperate for food on the corner of Flamingo & Eastern again, I'd rather eat at the McDs across the intersection. Their so-called mongolian BBQ is just meat & 4 or 5 veggies and the cooks are sloppy and flick everyone elses stuff into your bowl (I'm allergic to seafood, so not much here for me to eat). There are always hugh families with 20 to 30 unattended screaming children and babies running amok putting their germ riddle fingers in all the trays and ice cream. Waitress barely speak a lick of english and communicating with them is painful at best. However, this place is better by far then the nasty other location on Sahara & Rainbow I think it is. Yuck."}
{"text":"We walked in and I was hit by the aroma of grease. I remembered years ago when my old roommate came home after eating out with his family. He walked by me and he smelled awful! I asked him where he came from and he said they had dinner at the Buffet @ Asia. I said \" Dude, you stink.... like you've been working in a kitchen all day\".  Ever since that evening, I've never had the desire to dine there. But then a few nights ago when my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to give this place a try. We said that if there's a line then we'll move on, but nope, there was no line. It was actually pretty empty inside.   I only tried a few of their items, one of them being the beef and broccoli, and the beef was chewy. The chicken skewer and orange chicken were actually good. They served lobster that night and I took a small piece which only made me want more, it was good. I had a little bit of the pad Thai and it was just OK.  I also tried their donut which wasn't too bad. Not too much flavor, it tasted like fried dough that you would get at a fair.  I think we stayed for about 45 minutes, I was worried if we had stayed longer then I would unintentionally be wearing Buffet Eau de Parfum."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but has a tendency to get really dirty. Floor smells of rancid food in main dining room, and food constantly being replenished though often quality consistency sometimes lacking. One time can be really good, another time not so much. Of the two locations tend to eat at the Sahara location more frequently, but the east side location has drinks included and a little more reasonable. Price used to be a little less but still a fairly reasonable Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Yeah some people from my hometown in sac ask, \" Dude, you live in Vegas go to a real buffet.\" This is a real buffet. I am tired of the casino, Gordons fishstick buffets. The one thing that really amazed me, is included in the cost of the buffet $12 you can order Thai Iced Tea Complete with Boba... The food is awesome, the service was fast friendly and the food was Great and did not taste like boxed frozen Oscar Myer Corndogs."}
{"text":"Bad service, horrible attitude, day old food, didn't refill water machine, weak foam plates that bend when food is on it, plastic utensils."}
{"text":"Two people was $35.00 for all you can eat. I can't remember add 1.99 for soda or soft drink unlimited. I have been to some countries at Asia for couple years. And I always try different buffet at Las Vegas.  This is not the most worst buffet. But can't tell is good. Don't you think the seafood, dessert, sushi are taste good. Even the strawberry are not sweet, not sour, taste like plastic......  I would said that fair for the price with that quality and quantity. I try all the things, only drink, chicken wings and vegetables will take the second round.  And nothing surprise me. I would never go back again."}
{"text":"We went for Father's Day -- about $20/person. Lots of seafood, including grilled prawns, crab legs, and stir fried lobster tails, oysters, scallops, and even frog legs, OK sushi and nigiri, They also have your typical Asian fair -- deep fried, heavily sauced, w/ mayo, or sweet and sour, some kind of soybean, Mongolian stir fry... everything and anything... dessert was typical of an Asian style buffet. Dry cakes, self-serve froyo bar w/ various sugar toppings, and fresh fruit which included a chocolate fountain.      Servers were attentive, our drinks never ran empty... They accommodated our large party. (10+)It was good, you know, better than okay, just based on the different selections and variety. But ya... the eyes are always bigger than the stomach. So we overate, stuffed our faces, and stood by the \"no waste or you pay\" rule.   That's pretty much it. But a fork in it -- it's BEEN overdone."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best food buffets in Las Vegas and the price is also amazing at 8.29 for lunch and 12.99 for dinner."}
{"text":"there are day this place is really good, and there are day this place is just plain awful! it's a hit or miss, but as far as Asian Buffet, it's a lot better than most other Asian Buffets i been to. One other thing, watch out for family with little kids, they run around and screaming like crazy, not ideal for a date night"}
{"text":"My experience was good again. The bathrooms at this place aren't dirty as they were previous times. I came in for a dinner of 2 adults which was $29. They have better selection I guess because of the time. Mostly the usual but they had that Italian shrimp which I'd kill for. I love it here the staff was pleasant not as great lol. But when it comes to food nothing gets in my way.         OH and when I walked in I saw the health dept grade they were straight As which is a little hard to believe. Lol still good to know."}
{"text":"For less than $9 a pop, if I were a homeless guy, I would maybe try and save up enough to eat here for the day.   Not the best food by any means though."}
{"text":"Your typical Chinese food buffet an adequate selection. crawfish are small though when available."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in USA I go every weekend because they have all you can eat Cantonese lobster. The price is 16.99 and the lobster is fresh Maine lobster plus an amazing selection of sushi and other seafood plus regular Chinese selections.  The staff is always nice and it's normally busy.  Only place I've ever seen with all you can lobster."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place last week. After our ob/gyn department tour at St. Rose, I asked a fellow classmate about any local boba/milk tea places in the area. She suggested this place, since they had pretty good seafood and boba. I decided to try it out for myself with my classmates. For dinner, it only cost us $13. The place is pretty small when you walk in, but there is another eating area in the back. The food selection is somewhat varied. They have a small section for different soups, sushi, a grill area where you can get korean style ribs, seafood and beef cooked to your taste, dim sum, vegetables, and seafood, of course! I didn't get a chance to taste the lobster, since many people grab those first, and I didn't want to wait for them to make more...I love the spinach and the soy sauce/ginger fish they have. They have a mediocre dessert section (what do you expect from Asian buffets?), and I usually just get their almond jello fruit medley and coconut/orange jellos. Don't worry, they have the frozen yogurt machine, if all else fails!   The sushi is pretty fresh (mostly the salmon!). It's pretty cheap for what you get here, and I probably will take my parents here when they come visit. Warning: any food that is wasted will get charged.  In reality, I would only give this place 3 stars, but since they have all you can drink tapioca drinks (TARO MILK TEA!) that are pretty good, as well as Thai ice teas, included in their buffet....I'm going to give them 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the problem was that they didn't tell us that in 20 minutes they closed so we where eating and a lady tell us in 5 minutes I need you to leave.. so they basically kicked us out, plus we are 14 persons and they charge 15 it was definitely not a good experience"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. Seems like an average Chinese Buffet with less than average meat choices and below average cleanliness. For the amount of choices they offer, the $15 price tag seems excessive."}
{"text":"My family went there for dinner for the first time tonight and it was a TERRIBLE experience. The service and the overall presentation of the restaurant were decent. The food, however, was so bad that everyone got a stomach ache. I think we all had food poisoning. The food was also either bland or very salty. We did not try the Mongolian grill section, so I cannot speak on behalf of that. Will I go back, no."}
{"text":"From my past experiences at this buffet establishment, I would have to say with all brutal honesty, this restaurant is horrid outside, inside and its customer service. The place is so filthy... if you happen to look at the rafters above the general seating area, not the overflow room in the back, you would see that there's so much dust and clinging from underneath it, on top of it and all over the neon light strips installed above it. The bathroom could do better as well, it's not so well lit, at times the floor would be soaking wet in some spots, they could install better sinks with better faucets, the same could go with their toilets. Their hibachi/ Mongolian Beef station could do with a better and competent cook. When I tell them to not add any spicy flavorings to my plate, they would do it anyway by way of not properly cleaning the skillet surface that they work on after each use. Their customer service could use a huge tweaking as well, by removing that \"We Reserve the Right To Refuse Service to Anyone\" sign behind their cashier booth and to properly re-train their servers to be polite and cordial to all customers. Remember the Customer is ALWAYS RIGHT! Their servers always have an attitude towards customers, which is wrong of them to have. I do understand that working as a server is stressful and annoying, however, they chose to work those position.  A list of cosmetic and service improvements I strongly recommend that this establishment should consider...  1. Improve the lighting in the restroom, by replacing the incandescent bulbs above the mirror with recessed LED light bulbs or fluorescent light tubes (I highly recommend LED light tubes).  2. Install new stall dividers/ walls to remove the minor vandalism inside it. *Note: This would also force this establishment to close down or condense the restroom to the women's restroom for a couple of days*  3. Improve the seating throughout the restaurant with much more comfortable chairs and booths.   4. Install auto flushers for their sit-down toilets and urinals, make their sinks and soap dispensers also sensor based as well. *Note: see number 2.*  5. RE-TRAIN their servers, re-train them on how to replace water that happens to be dirty and to NOT HAVE AN ATTITUDE with the customers.   6. Either clean the rafters above the general population area of the dust and dirt that cling on to them or simply close it off with a drop ceiling. *Note: This would force this establishment to close down for a few days to a couple of weeks*  Those are some of the improvements that this establishment should definitely consider if they want to continue to have a good business and receive better customer reviews in the future. If not, they'll be closed down within the coming years and they'll lose their business license. They should really consider the customer experience over their definition an ethical business practice.  *ATTENTION* To all future customers and reviewers of this restaurant, if you happen to look up at the rafters and look closely there you'll see how filthy this restaurant is, let that be your first impression of the place and everything about this establishment will fall into place."}
{"text":"This place is a trip.   For lunch it is a phenomenal deal.  The food is so fresh because it is being delivered in copious quantities.   The place is just packed and food just disappears so quickly.    The servers are just awesome and treat you as if it is a full service restaurant not a buffet.   They go out of the way to take good care of you.    At dinner, they have crab legs, shrimp, and lobster.   The food is equally as fresh but the pricing is about 17 bucks plus a drink.  I am not a big fan of food that takes so much work to eat so I would rather do the 10 buck lunch without the shellfish.    Surprising place and a good bargain if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour on a Sunday very busy. Price was around $20 for two ppl. It's a very small buffet and building is small and very crowded. The food is average I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"When ever I am passing by Las Vegas with a craving for seafood this is the one stop shop. They have crab legs and oysters, pretty much the only things I eat most. There is also some decent sushi and a Mongolian grill that is delicious. The prices here I believe are fairly cheap compared to most places in Vegas that offer these foods. Ive never seen any of the food go empty and fresh food is always constant."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  I walked into this place knowing exactly what to expect - cheap, greasy Chinese food that will get you full. It was a weekend night, and all the nicer Las Vegas buffets had too long of a wait time for me to want to stand in line. I was hungry, and could pretty much eat anything after spending the entire day hiking in Death Valley.  Most of the food was decent; dishes are filled with MSG and oil but it's still tasty. There was a pretty good selection and you really can't go wrong when the tab is around $12-13 for dinner."}
{"text":"This would be a 0 star review but it won't let me go below 1. This place looks like a run down bar from the outside but my friends and I thought we might as well try it out. $17.83 to eat with a water to drink was what it cost and we all thought that number was a little high, but apparently that number was incredibly too high. Our server practically ran away from us leading us to our table (no manners whatsoever when she sat us) and when we went to get our food, we were all incredibly disappointed with the quality. This food provider (they don't deserve to be called a restaurant) found a way to both under and over cook a wonton and the sweet and sour chicken was dry and brittle. The sushi looked as if a dog jumped on the counter, ate some and the puked it back up because it looked and tasted horrendous. I asked to speak to a manager about how terrible our experience was and if we could get a refund. She told us that she can't give us a refund and that it's too bad our service was terrible. Apparently they have no shortage of customers because the way she treated us made it feel like they took our money and we might as well go pound sand. I will never go back to this place and I urge everyone else to stay away. 0 stars terrible service and quality of food."}
{"text":"I went last Friday night for Lobster night. Was only $16.99 per person. That was my main concern. What was served as Lobster was mostly shell and the worst parts of the Lobster. Tasted nothing like lobster. The quality of the buffet was average. Hours after I ate there I had stomach cramps ; so did everyone else in the party of five I was eating with. Had the runs the next day. I will never be back. I will spend an extra 10 bucks and go to Umiya Sushi for the best dining experience in Japanese food instead."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times the past month, and I'm glad to say that they've stepped up their service. They're no longer rude - they're actually really nice here now! We asked to sit in a different place, and the hostess smiled and was okay with that. The servers take the plates off the table must faster, and they don't neglect you anymore! Yaaay to not be neglected!!!   Food is still food. It's a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, and you can't really complain. This is NOT a luxury casino buffet, this is a buffet off the strip. So if you're expecting some gourmet Chinese food, this place is not for you! You'll have the usual mediocre sushi bar, the cream cheese wontons, cream cheese baked green mussels (YUM!), etc etc etc. I like the food here, so I don't have anything to complain about.   I'm definitely coming back here! This place has gotten better, and my tummy (and family) has left happy each time!  P.S. Refillable drinks (includ. Thai Tea) is 0.95 more! WORTH IT, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. At 8 dollars for lunch, I don't really mind the oily fried food because, for the same price, you could get oily fried food from Mcdonalds or Panda. However the food here tastes much better than fast food.   I tend to pick and choose the items i know are good, which are the Chinese donuts, string bean, crawfish, and fish. The fresh fruit looked standard as well. Every time i go to Buffet@Asia I am neither pleasantly surprises nor disappointed. I always get what I expect - greasy Chinese food, crowded dining areas, and quick but curt service."}
{"text":"I took my seven year old brother here last night (12/27/10) for a sister-brother date. My dinner was $12.99 and his was $6.99 for the kid's price. We were seated at a booth and went to town - sort of.   Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to see more non-seafood options for dinner. I'm not one to pile a plate 13 inches deep with crab legs and shrimp to chow down. I did like the neon orange honey shrimp and the seafood stuffing, served on a scallop shell, but wished they offered more non-seafood choices.   My little brother tried sushi for the first time (didn't like it) and a frog leg. I told him it was chicken and he said that he liked it until it \"started to taste like seafood.\" He was a big fan of the baby corn in the seafood medley. He was quite worried about cleaning his plate because he saw a sign that said that if food was wasted, there'd be an extra charge. We only took tablespoons of this and that, so it wasn't a problem.   The ice cream machine was out for almost all of dinner. We had the coconut jello which was good, and the rest of the desserts were ok. The candied nuts were decent. When the vanilla ice cream light went on, there was a big line for the ice cream - I got up to help my brother, as I had done the entire night, and our waiter completely cleared our table, like we left! We were seriously 6 ft away! My brother was a little upset because we had been hiding scallop shells in a napkin to take home and they got thrown away so we snuck two more out when we sat back down.  In addition to our table being cleared in the middle of dinner, nobody ever came to ask if we needed refills or anything. We were ignored the entire time by the staff. I had to ask for a water when our plates were cleared because they pretended like we weren't there. We were chewing on ice almost the entire night.   I've had good Asian buffets and bad ones, and this one is about middle of the road in terms of quality. I had to knock it down one star for service."}
{"text":"For the money you can't beat this place.  Wide selection of seafood, sushi, vegetables, Asian cooked dishes and fruits.  Place is clean, efficient and service is attentive.  I like the steamed fish, kung pao squid, baked mussels, Chinese food and sushi.  Food is salty but tasty.  I go early to any buffet and look for dishes just prepared.  Go hungry."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here 8 or 9 times a year, we enjoy the foods as well as the staff they go out of their way to accommodate us as we are a family of 5. During the dinner rush is when we like to go, There is a large turn over of hot fresh food that is flavorful and cooked with an american style asian palette. I take small portions of food per trip because IT'S A FRIGGIN BUFFET!!! LOL, you can go back for more. I see people with large amounts of food that can in no way be consumed hot till the last bit. Take your time and enjoy the experience of ASIA BUFFET."}
{"text":"$35 for two adults. They make you pay before you eat...prolly cuz they know it sucks. Hostess made me fold up my baby stroller and had no idea where I should put it. Ended up putting it underneath the table.  Bathrooms were gross. Crab legs were tiny...like the size of my hand. Everything was lukewarm. Hope I don't get sick.  Go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Came here pretty hungry and ready to grub on some serious dishes and sushi!   I think the only time I usually eat fried food is if it involves those sesame balls, crab ragoons, egg rolls and etc. I think the best part of this expericence was the coconut milk jello/pudding. Their sushi was okay, but then again, if you make tons of sushi in one setting to mass product it, eventually the rice and the ingredients won't be so fresh."}
{"text":"I came here twice already. Once for my birthday and recently for my hubbys. The sushi selection is way better then most Asian buffets. It's not fancy but the taste is there. My favorite thing to eat is probably the baked scallop things with the mayo based. Not sure the name of it but that one! Lol! I do like eating the clams and shrimp too but I try not to eat so much there because I normally get a stomach ache after mixing. The service is normally on point when it comes to swinging by to clean your table off so you can eat more and filling up your drinks again. There's a separate area where there is a bar you can sit near or at. More private and sometimes too cold lol. I like this better then the other competition buffet because of the food selection and sushi. If you want a good affordable Asian style buffet, I do recommend this place! (I mean, anything with sriracha does taste better lol!!!)"}
{"text":"service is fast ,the lady that served us is very attentive  to what we need. the food selection is the same food that you see on any asian buffet. plus they have ribs ,crawfish and they can cook the chow mein for u too..  cheap too im definitely  coming back."}
{"text":"Very surprised by this spot. Pretty clean but a little old. Decorating is horrible but I don't go there to check out what's on the walls. Food is consistent and not bad at all. I would actually go out on a limb and say it's better than most of the way over priced buffets on the strip. The guy that does the Mongolian remembers us every time and is as nice as nice can be."}
{"text":"I definitely would not recommend this buffet.  Price was $15 during dinner, which is outrageously expensive because the selection wasn't good for the price and the food tasted terrible. There was not one dish that I enjoyed here.  I had a really hard time enjoying this place. It looks and feels dirty. Flies flying around the food.  So to summarize.. EXPENSIVE, BAD SELECTION FOR $$$$, BAD QUALITY, DIRTY...  I have no idea why some people would rate this place highly...they are either associated with Buffet @ Asia or they have been fed dog food their whole lives. Seriously.  STAY AWAY...YOU WILL REGRET THIS PLACE IF YOU GO HERE..TRUST ME."}
{"text":"It was okay for just a quick lunch. The only thing g I didn't like was the dessert selection. They were out of ice cream or the machine was broken or something and there was just some melon and cookies."}
{"text":"My family decided to come here half an hour before closing. They told us that because it was so late, there wasn't going to be any more food being brought out, which seems reasonable. It was nice that they gave us the option to go inside and look at what foods they had left before deciding if we'd like to pay. My family was starving so ended up staying despite the lackluster food.  There really was nothing great about this place. I've definitely been to a lot nicer and better buffets. I got about two plates and decided I didn't want to put any more salty and greasy foods in my body.  Before people were even finish eating they had already started cleaning. I guess that goods to know... but it was kind of rude considering everyone was still getting food.  The experience was meh."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here after going to the Silver  Sevens buffet where it was probably the smallest buffet we saw. Buffet at Asia is 3 min away from our house so we were hoping it would be our go to place. During Dinner, crab legs are included so we were hopeful  Being from MD, we should have know better. They were tasteless, cold and mushy. The sushi was good, other food items were delicious. They even have frog legs for the adventurous type.  I tried but didn't like very much. Upon leaving I started to feel I'll. By the time I got to the car, the feeling like I was going vomit came over me. Before even leaving the parking lot, I threw twice!! Needless to say, it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not being going back!!"}
{"text":"Dirty is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this place. I was craving seafood so I did a google search and came across Buffet at Asia and BOY was I disappointed. A 20 minute drive to be sat in the back where excuse my language looks as if when the light go out the little creepy crawlers called roaches come out. I was disgusted but I felt bad because I have others with me. So we ate, the food was mediocre and I was anxious to get out of there. This place needs a major rehab and to be reviewed by food and health inspectors... Ijs seeing is believing"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice, price decent for having snow crabs and sushi available.  When you walk in and look up on the wall their is a big red sign that says \"3 and under free.\"  When the bill came to the table,   we were charged for our 3 year old.  When we walked up to pay and asked the cashier, she replied that the \"waitress measures her and tells us.\" Huh??  Then she pointed to the wall and pointed at the 3'.   I guess I missed it.  I didn't realize it was 3 \"feet\" and under.  (Which my daughter stood up against their wall and went above the 3 because of her ponytail.). Ya know, because here in AMERICA it's usually the AGE AND UNDER. So when I asked again about the price she made it sound like the waitress had to come over and measure again.  ??  The very rude cashier took my husbands card and swiped it.  When I asked what was going on,  she flipped out, got very loud and  told us we don't have to come back if we don't  want.   We won't.  Very unprofessional.  Go back to your village."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Asian style seafood buffet, this place is it! Once you've tried Todai and the Rio's Seafood Buffet, give this place a shot and I don't think you'll want to go back to either place for a seafood buffet ever again. I actually like it better than Todai and the Rio. It's got a better selection of food and it's half the price. Albeit the décor isn't as nice as the other two places, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at Todai and the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, it maybe only be $2 - 3 better.   This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a decent sushi bar (the freshness is a bit hit and miss towards the end of the night, but spectacular at lunch). Dinner gives you a selection of lobster, snow crab, mussels, oysters, fried shrimp, fried scallops, and so much more.   Since this place is off the strip, you also don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass.   This is our go to place when we were living in Las Vegas and had out of town guests that wanted a buffet. They've never been disappointed.   I'd technically rather give this place a 4.5 star because the ambiance isn't all that great, but this place deserves better than a 4, so I'm going with a 5 star."}
{"text":"Ya know its an asian buffet. It had frog legs! I like weird stuff like that. I didnt expect this to be a gourmet buffet. It is what it is. The sushi did not have too many to choose from, but they did have octopus and that made me very happy.  Crab is ok.  Whenever a new dish of it is put out it gets picked through like a pack of wild vultures attacked it. The deserts are really good, all the little jellos and the coconut squares of jelly. Octopus and frog legs."}
{"text":"Cheap, easy way to go for a buffet.  It's located in what I call the \"heart of the east side\" where China Olive use to be at. It's pretty small compared to other Buffet @ Asia restaurants, but the building itself was already pretty small.  Anyways.. Expect a wait. Not too long of a wait though. They're pretty quick on getting people in and out.  The food itself is your standard Chinese food. If you go during dinner, they have a selection on crab which is my favorite! I don't come here with high expectations, so I'm pretty well satisfied at the end of my meal. Their sushi is actually pretty decent as well.  Great place to go if you're on the east side and want some Chinese food."}
{"text":"Worst buffet I've ate in, would not recommend , crab legs no flavor and have no meat, server ZOE with a horrible attitude, I would 1000x recommend Hibachi Buffet at Stewart and Nellis, I promise it worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet was a new place to try, but unfortunately they were so so for the rating. They seem to have not fresh foods out and it seemed like they have not a good variety of food out. I would not really recommend them to anyone they were busy but this was just your average Asian/Chinese buffet. I am sorry but I would not return here."}
{"text":"The holy grail of chinese buffets...  The food is very fresh, and actually tastes so friggin good. I love that they offer chinese-american standards, and also a few other regional asian favorites. My favorite items are actually the plantains and the coconut jelly... mmmmm"}
{"text":"I just move here from San Francisco a month ago, so my wife and I usually find some buffet places to try since it's a rare in SF.   Today we hit Buffet @ Asia, Yes you can blame me for being brave after reading all the one star reviews. lol To make this review short. I WILL NOT EVER LOOK AT THIS PLACE AGAIN, even when passing by."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the FOOD WAS GREAT, Customer servicev was very nice, no complaints my Husband and I  Live in Henderson and well there's not a lot of Chinese buffets around here so my husband and I have to drive down town to get to Krazy buffet where we usually go we never thought we'd find anything close to it taste wise, and quality wise  but we were wrong Buffet @ Asia is 5 stars in my book my husband loved it here as well as I. They have a big selection of different kinds of food and the best part is the sushi it taste fresh the waiters were very nice didn't let our cups get empty at all My Husband and I will be back soon that's for sure."}
{"text":"Too dirty and their menu is now litterally like 5 items. Will not go to this location any longer. i gave it 4 or 5 tries and just keeps getting worse. I don't expect to use the restroom or clean tables but this time the food all smelled foul and god forbid they turn the ac on it is almost like they want you to either pass out or leave real quick. I understand you make cuts for buffets but my god either increase the price and fill it with edible shit or close. Literally every single thing tasted the same or same sauce. i am not sure if they got just one walk or what but all of the stuff had similar nasty shitty seasoning. I don't even fuck with the sushi so i got no idea if that's safe or how it tastes."}
{"text":"Get ready... 1, 2, 3, BARF. This place is the WORST buffet I have ever been to. I don't why everyone gives them all these stars. Yes the selection is vast, but the quality is poor. The stir fry is a joke and tastes horrid. The beef and broccoli tastes 3 days old and the lobster claws were soggy and disgusting. It is an overstatement to say that this place is good in any way. The sushi at this buffet is so disgusting, the salmon sashimi they offer at the sushi station is so watery and tasteless. I really hope I don't get food poisoning from eating that. Once again, the food sucks hardcore, the service is good and the staff is friendly. If you think this is good in any way you must have burned off your taste buds. HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Got here at 10:30am and the food was super dry and all breaded items were hard as a rock.   You would THINK they would be fresher early in the morning.  Save your money and go to Buffet Asia on Nellis. You'll be making a much better choice"}
{"text":"I went to @ Asia buffet, for my favorite Xmas tradition Chinese food, and movies, the place was packed but the service was great, quick drinks and plenty of food coming out of the kitchen, one of the best Suchi lay outs i've seen in a buffet here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one afternoon. I have to say it was one of the worst places I've ever been to. It was so dirty! There was food crumbs all over the seats and tables, a dirty mop leaning against a table, and dirty rags on a couple tables, the rags were black! It had a weird smell, and the customer service was terrible! I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you are craving various Asian food. It's super affordable.   Not a big fan of their space because it's very tight and you could barely move about if the place is busy. Their bathroom is the ever typical Asian restaurant bathroom- like no one ever checks up if it is dirty or if the toilets are clogged!   Food is okay- too much mono-sodium if you ask me. Some food are just completely tasteless and dry- like their ribs. Most of food are just okay and filling. I'm a fan of their fried frogs and salt-and-pepper pork.   I've had times where the servers are super attentive and friendly, but there are times where you just get snobby ones. So it depends. Overall, this place is very filling and affordable. Don't forget to try out their $1.99 boba slush- especially the strawberry one!"}
{"text":"this place was soo good... THAT I PASSED OUT!!! hahahaha  there are a lot of food choices... for a really low price... there is something about vegas and all the good cheap food there... lol   walnut shrimp is so good..."}
{"text":"The best in Vegas! A buffet that in the evening has snow crab legs, dungeness, sushi, salad, dessert and a mongolian style grill service. They have a separate bar area and this place is always packed"}
{"text":"I fancy myself an Asian Buffet connoisseur.  Thats fancy french for expert.  Anyway I have been on a quest to hit every Asian buffet while in vegas.  So far this one is the best.  Notice I did not say that it was good.  But you get what you pay for,  I went for Saturday dinner and I was not dissapointed.   The sushi and sashimi came out fresh and there is a stir-fry station where you can have a cook prepare it for you.  That is a nice option at a buffet.   My only down point was that the salad was wilted and warm.  I know most people don't go to an Asian buffet for salad but I like to mix in some roughage.   The staff is not very \"smiley\", but there were quick to remove my empty plates and refill my diet coke. So far if i had to return to one buffet in Vegas it will be this one.  Please see other posts for reviews on other buffets."}
{"text":"I happen to be on a quest of reviewing all of the most of the asian buffetts while in vegas.  Likle most of them this one was not that good, but not that bad either,  They were one of the only was that offered Sashimi instead of just plain sushi.  They also have a stir fri bar where a cook will cook the items of your choice while you wait.  The food was about average. The one let down was that the salad in the salad bar was warm and wilted.  I guess that most people do not go to a chinese buffett for salad, but since I am doing this everyday for almost three weeks, the inability to get any ruffage into my diet that day was dissapointing.  Plus it made me think if the salad was not being kept at the proper temperature what else might be amiss."}
{"text":"Parking:  Easy to find a spot in the parking lot even during peak times  Entrance: Courteous professional cashier. You prepay beforehand. Clean front lobby.   Ambiance: Casual, typical all you can eat buffet.   Price: For the price, you can't beat this spot. All you can eat Chinese buffet.   Food and quality: We're regulars at this restaurant as well as the location on Nellis. There is a very nice selection of dishes to choose from. The sushi bar offers a variety of different selections. The quality of food is very good and tasty. Just take what you can eat only and don't waste the food because they frown upon that.   Service:  The service is decent and don't expect to hold a conversation with the servers. They're there to bring your drinks and napkins and refills. It's very busy at lunch and dinner at this location. So basically you just need to eat, get full and go about your business.   Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual all you can eat Chinese buffet with good tasting quality dishes especially for the price. Great for bringing a big family or group."}
{"text":"can't complain! decent food, decent price, really quick service...never without a drink. The only think that caught my eye was a little sign that read dinner guests only ....if you get someone left over from lunch into dinner are you really going to stop them from eating once inside."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Asian Buffet Restaurants since moving to Vegas. All of them seem to have one theme, that is average plain food served in large quantities.  Its sad but this Buffet is no different with its food selection but I will say the Black Pepper Frog Legs are the best item on their Buffet and they are simply the best damn Frog Legs I've ever had!  For those of you who love their Lobster dish: yes I tried their lobster dish and this Seafood lover wasn't overly impressed. It was messy and since you had to shell the lobster yourself you ended up with their slimy sauce all over your fingers and if you are a little bit clumsy like me it will fall off of your plate and land onto your shorts.    Also today's lobster tasted very strongly of fish (for those of you land locked Vegas locals your fish and seafood shouldn't smell strongly of stinky fish. If it does it indicates its not fresh and hours away from making you sick) today's lobster dish was stinky to say the least but I did brave a few bites. Thinking of my digestive health I thought it a wise choice to push the last few pieces aside.  The Sushi seemed OK but was mostly rice. I guess it was what you'd expect at a buffet.  Service at the door was a bit cold. We were there a good hour and a half before closing but the server seemed rushed and disinterested in making us feel welcome. In fact she walked us to a back room pointed at a table and only said sit there before walking away. We were the only new customers so she didn't need to rush back. A simple statement of your server will be right with you but feel free to help yourself would have been nice.  The waitress was very attentive and cleared empty plates and filled sodas quickly. Almost made me forget how we were treated at the door.  For $70 (dinner for three and a tip) I guess I was expecting a top notch experience they were unable to deliver. I'd go back to give them a 2nd try but tonight I left sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick cheap place to eat that is all you can eat and want more then what panda express gives you then you have come to the right place.   I truthfully like this place however this is no casino buffet so people shouldn't be going to this place expecting to get treated like world class customers from staff or expect 5 star diamond treatment all the time.   The food is pretty standard Chinese selections as well as fruit and salad. They do have sushi as well as limited deserts such as jello ice cream and a couple other things but not much selection or extended variety as other places. Servers are pretty quick to get drinks refilled for the most part and clean up finished plates.   Their soda selections are Pepsi products such as Pepsi dr. Pepper, and you know the rest. I have gone a few times and do like it however being honest the crap legs like are way to thin and you have to literally grab about two to three plates of them and really spend a long time to break them and go through before you get full.   On the buy one get one beer even though the beers are the same price they do not let you try to get two different beers which is a little silly in my view. If you want a bud light and to try another beer once you pick one you have to have the same one which is really weird.   Overall I have not had many problems however be advised, if you should go here that once again this just a cheap easy quick meal that doesn't come with much incentive other then just eating standard Chinese food that panda express makes just with unlimited food that you eat."}
{"text":"Love the food, always pretty busy.. Especially during lunch. Not crazy over priced. Worth 9.00 for lunch but then you have to pay for drinks additionally. I come here quite often. People are nice. Overall, good service."}
{"text":"I normally love Asia Buffet.  But this location is the WORST.  All the food was dried out underneath those heat lamps. The service was horrible.  We placed an order for the custom made noodles and the guy didn't bring them to us until we were about to leave.  I was so disappointed.  It was not clean.  It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"one word...GROSS!! We tried this buffet as it was highly recommended by a friend in Hawaii. I was not impressed at all. The food was displayed in a very unappetizing manner, and things seemed unsanitary. The food wasn't great either. You are better off at Panda Express. I left there feeling sick like I just had a meal in China. The workers don't all speak english, I asked someone what something was as not all the food was labeled. He looked at me and didn't utter a word and just shrugged his shoulders. Not good if you have food allergies, don't expect them to help you."}
{"text":"At $6.99 for lunch + the optional $1.29 for soda + tax = $8.95, a lunch at Buffet @ Asia II should be on anyone's Vegas cheap eats list.  Is it gourmet? Definitely not.  But what you get for dining here is the great selection of items that are constantly being refilled by the staff.  I braved the sushi selection, which is okay at best.  It has your typical inexpensive California rolls to those that are topped with broiled eel and eel sauce.  If you want AYCE sushi, I guess you can do it here on the cheaps or better yet, pony up another $13-15 for it at a AYCE sushi place around town.  The Chinese food section is better. Although there are some items that I would suggest avoiding all together, such as the Salt & Pepper Shrimps (it can be messy to eat, and the quality of the shrimp or the way it was way overcooked makes it not worth the effort or the chance to waste the food).  And here is a quick review of what I remembered eating.  Mapo Tofu. Tofu is good, not spicy, and not the authentic version you would expect if you ordered this at a regular Chinese place.  Beef & Broccoli: I liked it.  Beef Tenderloin: Too tough, which means it was overcooked.  Seafood Combo: The shrimps are cooked well and it is tasty, but the imitation crab meat is not good at all. My guess is the quality of the imitation crab meat used is on the cheap and low quality spectrum, which means it is made more with flour fillers than fish.  Chicken entrees: I tried all of them and I think they are all pretty good for a buffet.  Except the chicken wings, which are fried too long, and pretty dried inside. The teriyaki Chicken is also okay at best.  Vegetable Tempura: Not the refined version served at most Japanese restaurants, but I still enjoyed it.  The yam tempura is my favorite.  As it can get rather greasy, I suggests waiting for it to be refilled and grab the ones on the top.  Wonton soup: Definitely have had better.  Garlic String Beans: Good but greasy.  Mongolian BBQ Station: I didn't try it. Dessert Donut: Not bad for fried dough tossed in sugar.  Agar agar based desserts: Not bad.  Except all the plates are kept hot for the hot foods, that it warms up the desserts you place on it.  You can also order boba drinks and customize it with the fruit smoothie flavors you want for an additional nominal charge.  Service is good, definitely enough waitstaff to clear the tables quickly and offer to refill drinks frequently.  Location: Conveniently at the corner of Rainbow and Sahara.   Parking: There are plenty.  Perverted Old Asian Men:  Must have came on a wrong day/time or seated in the wrong section, but I didn't see any.  Take out: Yes  Price:  Pretty low.  So perfect for those on a tight budget that can't cook at home."}
{"text":"When you need an all-you-can-eat fix (AYCE F), this place will do it.  Easier than going to a hotel, it's a standalone building with fairly easy parking.  It's cheap, ahem, well-priced.  With Lunch $8.29 & Dinner $12.49 (drinks extra), a little goes a long way.  Influenced by Japanese and Chinese cooking, it has all the goodies you can expect.  A plethora of a selection that includes Sushi, Mussels, Fried Dumplings, BBQ Spareribs, noodles, and salad bar for lunch.  Add to that for dinner: Snow Crab, New Zealand Green Mussels, cocktail shrimp, and a small Mongolian section - yum.  Take it from me whose dined here 5-6 times over the years, it's A-Okay in my book.  PS.  They even have pizza!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi bar, very popular place. Great selection of food!"}
{"text":"This place is repulsive the workers are rude they don't pay any attention to you and it's super dirty.cups are never clean plates are dirty too  Never ever going back!"}
{"text":"One of the worse experiences. Waitress kept saying we had to pay for another person since we wanted a high chair. We had already paid for 8, which was the amount of people in our party, but since we wanted a high chair she said there would be 9. Finally manager came over and after arguing with her about only having 8 people and that we needed the high chair for my niece that we already paid for, manager finally said ok. Then we asked for water and the waitress said if we got water, we wouldn't get refills on our sodas. But when we asked for refills she was rude and huffed about it. At one point we asked her for something but she didn't respond, so we asked her again, when she yelled at us \"I know!, I heard you!\"  The food was horrible as well. We all left there smelling of bad fish. Selections were old and nothing tasted good. Will never come back to this place or any other of their buffets. I'd give them 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Well first of all the woman checking people in and taking orders was ignoring guests and there was a long line to the door ...and proceeded to give attitude to someone in my party. They sat us next to a wall with a hole in it and the waitress was exrealy rude when we were ordering our drinks the lady slapped down the napkins on the table and walked away all sassy like ..They need to get that handled ..after my first drink they didn't ask me if I wanted another drink.. so I only had one , but other then that my food was decent"}
{"text":"I was skeptical to go here tonight because of the reviews. We got there around 5:30 and the line was out the door, usually a good sign! We waited about 15 mins for a table. Our drink order was taken immediately. Dirty plates were gone quickly as well as drinks refilled on time! The food was very fresh and good!  The sushi was awesome..a lot of variety! I'm so happy we went. I left with a full belly and a few extra dollars in my pocket!  ( they have a 10th anniversary price special 12.50 for dinner..) can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The food was alright.  Not the best buffet I've been to but It's cool.  Lots of different dishes to choose from.  The workers were constantly bringing out fresh food.  The sushi looked and tasted fresh.  The Mongolian bbq station had all the fixings to make your food, but there was nobody standing at the grill to make it for you - sucks!  The workers were quick to refill drinks and take away dirty plates - nice!  All in all - I would give this another try...if and when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"THE WORST CHINESE BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS!!! The food selection is horrible, place is dirty and workers have no customer service skills. Now they serve food on paper plates... Are you kidding me!?!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time surprisingly the sushi isn't too bad. shrimp is crispy. Overall it's just ok , the crab legs are so skinny I think they were on a diet before the got cooker lol. The upside is they are pretty cheap if you are hungry for inexpensive food that is so so in my book.  I like Krazy Buffet better and their crab legs are much more plumped.  Happy yelping xoxox"}
{"text":"I  used to go there years ago.  I went a few months ago and it SUCKED. It looked dirty, the help was rude and the food was pretty disgusting.   I was really embarrassed because I took someone who had never been there before. I'm a bit surprised that this place hasn't been totally closed down. A real waste of money"}
{"text":"There is probably not anything in the world that will get me excited to go to a buffet, but I was really not feeling this place. Maybe I'm just a buffet snob, but here it goes.  The place is always packed and that's not a good thing. People are crammed in here like sardines and on a hot day with limited air conditioning capacity, it sucks. It was hot and uncomfortable, combine that with a cramped setting and hot plates and I was not a happy camper. Service was fair. Better than most Asian buffets I've been to in the past, but the food just wasn't good. It all seemed to be sitting on the line too long, which was weird since there were so many people, you'd thing the turnover would be quick. Nothing seemed very fresh and I ended up sticking to fruit and rice for my entire meal.  I won't be back, I sulked enough to my fella during the meal to ensure that. Haha."}
{"text":"So, I'm not a big fan of buffets typically but my fella was talking non-stop about wanting an Asian buffet for weeks, so I finally gave in to make him happy. We brought my mom along for good measure.   Upon entering, the restaurant was packed. I was definitely concerned and reluctant to go in if there was going to be a long wait. Luckily we walked right in and have no wait whatsoever. The service was ok, nothing exceptional but they refilled our drinks regularly and brought us napkins when we requested them. The food is just standard, as well. Definitely nothing exceptional, but pretty good for the very, very cheap price.  I don't think I'll make this a regular place on my food rotation, but it's good to have this option on the cheap from time to time."}
{"text":"You need to know what is good in this place. Some items may not be fresh because they are not popular, and some items may not be very tasty, and you should not go to this location for sushi or quality of service. It is just a Chinese Buffet, and it is the best you can find in Las Vegas, unless you are paying $30/person or more. For the price we always enjoy the salads, the crab legs, the Mongolian BBQ, the Singapore noodles, the spicy chicken, and the mussels and clams which the clams are my absolute favorite. Give this place a chance, and if you want quality of service do not go to an authentic ethnic food buffet, as that kind of service is more a cultural thing (specifically American)"}
{"text":"I was trying to walk around the restaurant to find out what they provide before I actually sit down and eat. The waitress and manager prohibited me from doing so. They asked me to pay at first to walk around. How can I make decision whether I should eat before looking at what they serve? Most other buffet allows me to do so, the worst case is they ask me just walk a little bit. And this restaurant totally disallowed me to do so. I have been to a lot of honest restaurant, and this is by far the worst one!"}
{"text":"There is many selection of food from sushi to seafood, but they seem mediocre, but my Complain is that the service is terrible the staffs seems mean and rude and they ask u for the tip before you get to eat so when i tipped usually base on the service so I kinda felt cheated cuz service was terrible they are defiantly not a friendly staff and the decor is pretty out dated seems like they haven't fix the place since 1990s"}
{"text":"I come here a lot with my mom and the food is delicious. However, I came on the 24th for lunch and the chicken was cold and burt at the bottom."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money coming to this establishment.  The food is so gross and I got a stomach ache coming here. I think they don't know how an establishment should be ran! Their \"hot\" foods are cold and their \"cold\" foods are hot. It's honestly so disgusting eating sushi that is warm and the inside stuffing is so dry (maybe from how hot they've become).  Also, their food labels are wrong... like really."}
{"text":"Just horrible. Tasteless low quality food, fried crap, dirty floors and bathrooms, I can't believe they are still in business. I will never ever eat here again in my life!"}
