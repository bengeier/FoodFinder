{"text":"Was there with my family early supper before 4:30. I presented a coupon before the meal and from then it went downhill. 15 minutes for popcorn that we had to ask for. Once the food arrived the portions as always huge,monte Carlo potato was the only high point. My Caesar salad was bitter and the dressing was almost tasteless. Our waiter was not readily available despite the fact that it was quiet. Food was at best average. We had to get up and get ketchup from another table which had at most a squirt left in it,then we tried another table,waving down the waiter for a refill and the dessert that was included with the $6.99 kids meal ,icecream which tasted like it had freezer burn. When the bill arrived the coupon was not deducted and after we left we realized that we where charged $2.99 for a kids sized fountain 7up the same price that we paid for the adult size.2 meals, one fry (huge portion)one kids meal 2 soft drinks with$11.00 coupon still ran us $55.00 ."}
{"text":"So let's say that I saw my waiter twice and had to ask for the bill which took another 30 min.    One glass of water after asking for some and once ready to pay it took 10 min for the machine.      The food,,, let's say go to Wendy's would of been a better choice."}
{"text":"Excellant restaurant pour tout les gout! Ils offrent de bons speciaux à tout les jours. Bon service que ce soit du coté salle a manger ou bar. Je nai jamais été déçu!"}
{"text":"Always go to this restaurant when visiting my family in Montreal. It's my favorite place for breakfast, the omelettes, toast and coffee are great. Service is not bad. For lunch I've tried the cheese lasagna(amazing), chicken brochettes and fish and chips are some of my favorites.  I love this place:-)"}
{"text":"This place was fine.  They accepted me close to closing time, and did so with friendly service, so I give them credit for that. The regulars sitting around the bar got quiet for awhile after I walked in but eventually began chatting and hugging their beers again.  They were sweeping the floor all around me as I ate which is a big turn off - but then again I was there with just minutes to go before closing so I won't complain.  Don't be afraid to stop in this place for an average working class meal. As a previous reviewer said, \"the food isn't to die for but it's good old fashioned Canadian food.\"  You can be sure the local hockey game will be on the big screen."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food. Thankfully they were willing to speak English to this American business man!  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Your typical family joint- this one is a popular spot in the shore. They're know for their mailed out coupons and 2 for 1 deals that make the meals here worth more than your bang for the buck. 

Easy access on Taschereau by bus of car with plenty of parking. There is a lot of seating indoor, outdoor and for private events- reception room in the back that can be rented out for large parties. Reservations for 5 or under usually not required even on weekends.

You get complimentary popcorn before your meal. Just a side note: the meals are actually very large - can easily be shared amongst 2. We ordered (rating out of 5 *): 

garlic butter butterfly shrimp plate *** (10 pieces of shrimp and a chicken broth rice); teriyaki chicken filet plate****(note- this usually comes with a honey mustard sauce- I replaced it, sides - a creamy whipped Monte Carlo potato****highly recommend, rice and Caesar salad): grilled chicken garden salad***(good portion of chicken and salad but kind of dry); 

VEGAN options -my sister and her bf opted for a vegetarian mushroom burger with fries ***, a vegan pizza which is nothing but dough and roasted veggies - but considering this is a deli grill - both were happy campers.  

Dessert: 2 for 1 on cake on Sundays - cheese cake**** was moist and so good but I had no space!

All this for 72$ for 6 ppl without tip. Can't get better for a family deal!!"}
{"text":"Les service est lent, pas toujours courtois. La nourriture est ordinaire, sans plus... 
Pizza,Pâtes on ne perd pas son temps à manger  des côtes levées ici quand le Baton Rouge est si proche!"}
{"text":"Large menu, reasonably priced and always has coupon deals that makes it a great place to spend the night with friends for cheap.
The food isn't to die for but it is good old fashion Canadian food. Great poutines, good club sandwich and fun atmosphere:) Next time I want to try the baked potato hear it is yummy.
Sure it get's busy sometimes but that is part of the charm.
The service is great, wait staff is friendly and bilingual which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Bon, ce n'est pas un restaurant \"fancy\" mais il offre des repas simples pour tous les goûts de style pâtes, salades et viandes. Le prix sont accessibles et il y a régulièrement des rabais. Généralement, le service est bien, mais étant aller beaucoup de fois, je ne peux pas dire qu'il est parfait."}
{"text":"Bon prix, bonne bouffe et bon service. Nous avions des coupons deuxième déjeuner à moitié prix. Deux bonne omelettes des trois ufs chacun café, jambon patates pour 15$ taxes comprises"}
{"text":"A poor man's \"Cage aux Sports\". So, if you're looking for a place to watch some sports and hang out with friends and don't really care what you're eating, this is the place to go.

I don't recommend it for a work lunch (90+ minute experience) with a lot of waiter searching. Went with a safe choice and ordered a cheeseburger and upgraded my fries to onion rings. Fun Facts time. I rarely am unable to finish my onion rings and Barbie's can be among the proud members of that prestige club. The onion rings were clearly coming directly from a prepared bag. Some of them were still COLD inside and weren't heated properly, The breading was uninspiring.

The Burger meat pattie was bland with no spicing and absolutely no salt. The cheese in the burger wasn't melted and the onions weren't caramelized. Frankly, it was a sad burger! Amateur hour.

Found a random chicken nugget within my onion rings (don't ask how it got there). Ate it for the hell of it. Ended up being the highlight of my meal and bumped up my rating from 1 to 2 stars. If I'm ever back here (maybe I'm a masochist), I'll order this instead.

They have a full menu (unsure why) but your expectations should be this is where you drink a few beers and eat some finger food. They couldn't get a burger and onion rights so I'm unsure how they'll get fancier stuff right. No way I'm paying near $30 for a rack of ribs in this joint.

Will not re-visit."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Gets busy but we got there early. I had the veggie pizza. It was great. Deep dish, served in the pan. Buy one get one coupons. Great deal. They speak French and English. Free wifi. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ça reste un Barbie's ou tout les plats sont corrects, mais un peu trop cher pour la qualité des aliments. Aussi les portions sont tellement grosses que vous pourriez vous nourrir pendant 3 jours avec votre plat!"}
{"text":"Merveilleux et service impeccable... Bravo à notre serveur Louis Provost... Je t'adore et continu ton bon service!!  :-)"}
{"text":"je dois dire bonne place pour un souper entre chum ou entre gang avec une bonne bière les plat sont copieux nous avons essayé les ribs le hamburger les brochettes de poulets cetait bien comme resto fast food le service etait bien, beau sourire le personnel fins cest simplex comme bouffe cest bon qualité prix"}
{"text":"Decided to go eat there for lunch today. Use to go there many years ago. Wanted to see something new! Service was slow, the waitress was not the best I ever had. Food were good but I ate better than this. Had an dessert and tasted like if it came out from the freezer.  The seating area at the bar section (booth) were tight especially for my physical weight!"}
{"text":"Hmm, was not impressed with my last visit,  the service was awful and the food just average. The only best part about Barbies is their baked potato. However the location is great for families who want to throw a birthday party or just pretty much anything for groups of folks to much over some great time. With that said if you like baked potatoes, please do try the baked potatoes here. I dont know how they make it but they actually mix the potatoe with cream cheese and stuff it back in the potatoe with cheese on top. The word YUM with even caps lock does not cover the taste that I am trying to describe."}
{"text":"I went to Barbie's with family, and despite a nondescript appearance we had some great food. My smoked meat platter was a tremendous value. The smoked meat was as good as I can remember since Schwartz's, tender and moist and very tasty. The french fries were classic Quebec fries - very, very good. The before 4PM price was a bargain for such a large portion.

Service was fine, and there's plenty of free parking.

Barbie's is a hidden jewel. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you feel like frozen food, I'd recommend you better off getting some stacks at the grocery store instead of wasting your money here. 

I came here twice in two years and gave them enough chance.

Service was at least fast last time, but what else to expect from frozen food?"}
{"text":"My experience at Barbie's wasn't horrible but it wasn't a standout either. Firstly , they have a nice spacious location with lots of parking and lots of seating both in and outdoors which is great for larger groups to be able to be seated comfortably. The hostess we had was not very friendly, not rude but couldn't even be bother to crack a smile when greeting us.  However, our server was excellent, he was friendly, attentive and quick which was great ! Foodwise though , while it wasn't horrible by any means, it was very ordinary (Although the portion size does help to justify pricing). We started with their tropical sangria pitcher (28$) but it was quite big and came with a complimentary order of Nachos (nachos were just so-so but they were free so cant complain too much) and the sangria was pretty good.  I had their lasagna which was HUGE and wasn't horrible but there was barely any meat in it and the pasta was a little overdone for my liking , but their sauce and cheese was tasty. I tasted their Fish and Chips as well (The portion was large but the fries were a little soggy and the fish batter was a too oily).  The Fajitas were probably the best of the 3 dishes I tried as they had the most flavor. Overall, this is more of a casual place to come to with a larger group to have a few drinks if you're not looking for anything special foodwise."}
{"text":"This is actually one of my favorite restaurants. I've been coming at this specific Barbies for almost a decade, it's always been a family tradition for special events. I absolutely love that they keep sending coupons in the mail which make for a very affordable meal. Coupons are \"buy 1 meal,  get the other free if it's 11$ or less, you pay the extra.
My favorite dish is the filet of sole which comes with an amazing cesar salad, rice, and monte carlo which is the best you'll ever have.
Portions are huge! People always bring doggy bags home.

Although they've made many changes to their restaurant, in terms of decor and prices over the years, food has always been consistently good. This place used to be very casual cool, brick walls, neon signs, with wacky interior props like a vintage bathtub at the entrance full of peanuts and jukebox and licence plates on the walls. Now, it looks more like your family dine in restaurant, dim lighting, shades of brown and beige, which doesn't feel original.
They still serve complimentary popcorn on request and as long as the food is good and cheap, I'll keep going."}
{"text":"Si vous vous demandez: ouais, nous sommes allés à cause de la \"mausus de toune\". On voulait en avoir le coeur net, alors on a fait un événement Facebook, on a organisé du covoiturage et on a chanté sur une story Instagram devant l'enseigne!

* L'endroit *

Accessible, près du métro Montmorency, grand stationnement aussi. C'est bon! 

* Le festin (?) *

Ouais, comme disait précédemment Jason M., c'est un peu comme l'enfant d'une \"Cage aux Sports\" et d'un \"Scores\". Burgers, grillades, pizza, c'est essentiellement du fast-food mais avec un service aux tables. Le menu est très varié donc pour les familles c'est bingo. Il y avait même certains points-forts comme les pommes de terre garnies, la sauce des côtes levées, les portions généreuses. Avec un pichet ou une pinte de bière pression (bières domestiques, quoique le serveur ne savait pas ce que \"domestique\" voulait dire) ça descendait bien. 


* L'ambiance *

Un samedi soir, c'est comme participer à 5 fêtes d'enfant en même temps avec un fond de télé qui diffuse du sport. L'aménagement de la salle à manger (plafonds hauts, tables collées) fait que le bruit des conversations de tout le monde est décuplé. Mais pour en revenir aux anniversaires, j'pense qu'à Laval le restaurant s'est imposé comme un incontournable pour l'occasion parce que pendant notre visite, l'équipe des serveurs a chanté \"bonne fête\" à différentes tables entre 5 et 10 fois. C'était tellement absurde que j'ai ri. 

Nous avons été nourris, nous avons satisfaits notre curiosité, maintenant que c'est fait je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Poutine- blah and they use crappy fries which makes such a difference. The spaghetti sauce beyond gross! It tastes like Asian Pho with tomatoes crushed in it. Not one Italian spice in it, it was like sweet cinnamon, coriander, star anise, & clove tasting but it was not Italian or tomato tasting. The smoked meat sandwich was tasteless. Pizza was decent. Wouldn't be excited to go back unless it's just for drinks. Too bad because the place is super cute but the food is junk!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant/bar which offers a broad menu of items in a relaxed environment.  We found the food pretty good (try the smoked meat!), and the service was reasonably good."}
{"text":"Actually was not as bad as i thought. I ordered the surf and turf amd it was pretty hood. The onion soup was a liytle salty but besides that i eas happy."}
{"text":"Le barbies à perdu des plumes avec le temps. Originalement un resto où on avait un mix de resto bar où la nourriture était en quantité et qualité qui reflète le prix, maintenant c'est différent.

Est ce que la nourriture est toujours aussi bonne? Cela dépend de ce que l'on prend. Pour ma part, Je prends souvent des pizza ou hamburger. Le midi du pizza ghetti. La première chose qu'on remarque, Depuis quelque temps, les frites ont changer pour des petite frites moles genre mcdo, mais sans goût,mal cuite et pas bonne. Donc moi qui prenait souvent un extra poutine, c'est fini.

Pour les portions, j'ai pris quelque fois l'assiette de chips et salsa en entrée le midi. L'assiette était grande et bien garni. Lors de mon dernier passage,le soir, l'assiette était environ la moitié de la taille, Et plus cher.

La qualité des repas semble aussi avoir diminué. Je ne sais pas si c'est un changement en cuisine ou dans les recette, mais plusieurs aliments sont sans goût alors qu'avant, C'était avec beaucoup de goût.

Côté service, c'est comme ce genre de resto (style cage au sport), Donc pas à crier que c'est mauvais mais pas à se péter les bretelles non plus. Ma dernière visite on était sur la terrasse et on à vu la serveuse 2 fois. On à demander quelque chose pour mon enfant, normalement il y avait des crayons avec un naperon enfant, mais ça semble avoir disparu puisque personne en à trouvé. Le pire, il était 3h pm en dimanche, On était 3 couples sur la terrasse et personne à l'intérieur."}
