{"text":"I generally love Milio's. I don't go there often, as it isn't really in my budget. A friend of mine and I ordered subs to be delivered on 2 different occasions. Each time, they screwed up our order, the girl on the phone was RUDE with us and was upset when we asked her to repeat the order, and when we asked for a name she hung up on us. I haven't felt inclined to order or stop in at this Milio's location since then. Can you blame me though?"}
{"text":"Order was going to be an hour late, cancelled it... They still charged me. Never will ever give any Milio's my business again. Disgusting practice."}
{"text":"I have eaten quite a bit of Milio's over the years.  Sub sandwich take-out places are a dime-a-dozen, but there really are significant differences among them.  For instance, the 800-pound gorilla, Subway, is horrible.  Their bread is the kind of crumbly, pseudo-italian loaf you find under a generic name at your grocery store bakery.  No flavor or texture.  And they automatically squirt some kind of noxious vinegar crap on everything in a vain effort to add some, really, *any* kind of flavor to their bland sandwiches.

Milio's stands out for me, mostly because of the bread.  It is hearty and filling, with a nice chewy crust and fluffy but not crumbly interior.  Their fillings are pretty standard but are decent quality.  I've never had a complaint about the amount, but then I don't like an over-filled sandwich, which just makes for a mess to eat.  

They happen to be convenient to a weekly rehearsal I drive across town to, but I still think they are better than the other sandwich options available."}
{"text":"I stopped at this Milios in downtown Madison for a quick supper. 
Ordered a milios classic for take away. I go home and half way through my sandwich realized there is no smoked ham in it ( as promised ). I called and the manager quickly apologized and offered the next sandwich free! 
How was the hamless sandwich? Apart from the subjective disappointment of a step down, it was a good turkey sandwich!
Looking forward for a classic sandwich next time!"}
{"text":"I can confidently say that I've eaten my last sandwich from this location and probably ALL Milio's.  

When I arrived at the drive thru there were only two cars ahead of me so I figured it should be pretty quick.  However, I was very, very wrong.  I ordered my sandwich and waited in line for the cars ahead of me to move out of line.  That wait ended up being 10 minutes.  I would have exited the line and gone somewhere else if it wasn't for the curb by the drive thru.

I ended up waiting about another 10 minutes to get my sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty standard.

My experience has been pretty similar in past visits.  This is by far the slowest sandwich place I have ever visited.

Suck it, Milio's.  I'm out!"}
{"text":"Ok the food here you can get anywhere else never felt it was worth talking about to anyone.

However today I saw a red hatchback with a Milios flag that works at this location driving extremely recklessly. 

We all need to avoid this place, giving jobs to drivers that are trying to hurt people on the roads! 

No thank you. Please consider paying more to get better staff or please close up shop and leave."}
{"text":"I actually really like the subs, but the morons working really made this review.
With the amount of unemployed people looking for work you decide to hire complete morons with no customer service skills."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this milio's, I swear I'll never go back. They get the order wrong EVERY TIME. skinny #5, NO VEGETABLES. They put the lettuce, tomato and onion on EVERY TIME. 

It requires all of my self control to not go back and hurl these messed up sandwiches at their door."}
{"text":"Excellent Sandwiches. That said...

Do not order delivery around lunch! I've been waiting close to 2 hrs for my sandwich and haven't even received a phone call confirming the online order I placed. (I did receive a confirmation email.) This is the second time this has happened. Last time I told them to forget it and went elsewhere. 

Milios-If you can't deliver in a reasonable amount of time, you need to hire an additional person or get rid of your delivery service. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Sulky customer service every time I've been here. They also skimp on the portions compared to other Milio's locations in Madison."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are good - but nothing extraordinary. The prices are fine, and the service is pretty fast. I've only come here if I need food quickly and have no other options."}
{"text":"The California sub is a must!!! Perfect lunch sub to get. Love getting lunch here especially when short on time."}
{"text":"good food, ****ty customer service

So I've been a milios fan for a while--in fact I think its better than JJs (mostly because they offer a yummy wheat bread). I am not a fan of their customer service however. I ordered a sandwich from them, and in the midst of game day snacks, I decided to save my sandwich for later. I dont like wasting food so I went to go eat it the next day. To my surprise, my turkey on wheat w/ extra tomato, was nothing more than provolone cheese and greens. I called them, because I at least wanted my money back since I had paid for meat and was going to toss this subpar sandwich.

Initially they were super cool and instead of my money back decided to send me a fresh one right away. Upon arrival the delivery guy ASKED FOR THE OLD SANDWICH. I told him I tossed it and he was welcome to take a peak at my garbage can. I found that to be incredibly insulting, I am a loyal milios customer and I wasnt about to cheat them out of a free sandwich...correction: I WAS a loyal customer. Insulting a customer over a $5 sandwich, resulting in a loss of all future $5 sandwich purchases from me--great business model, Milios."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwiches w/o tomatoes, when we opened them they had tomatoes and the bread wasn't fresh :("}
{"text":"This place is the best they hook you up, never got a bad order,  best customer service, I recommend this place!  Best Subs in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"I love this location! The employees are always friendly and the service is super fast.  The location is in a great spot with tons of parking and the store is always clean. Great job!"}
{"text":"Employees are friendly and speedy.
If your order was wring they will remake it for you no problem.
Food is great!!!! Service with a smile is always nice
Would give 5 stars but the prices are a bit to high!!!  They are remodeling soon, I will update soon!"}
{"text":"Never really liked their subs. I also worked with a couple employees and they hated working here (this location). They also said most of the profit go to feed the owners' drug addiction. So... Yeah."}
{"text":"Great bread!  But I wish the sandwiches were a little bigger.  I got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quickly...left me hungry!  I guess I'll try the french bread next time.  Maybe it's a little bigger."}
{"text":"Never again. If there was the option of no stars or negative stars... that would be my choice. Where to begin... I will start with the positive ... the service is fast ... and then it is all down hill from there ... sure the service is fast, that is because they are done making the sandwiches as there is hardly any meat on them or condiments to give the dry bread some moisture! I cannot for the life of me figure out how they could be so popular!"}
{"text":"Everytime we order a sub from Milios, there is ALWAYS a problem.  Two separate times could not deliver because no employees working, one time could not take credit cards/debit card because machine down, one time no bread available (reminder this a \"SUB\" shop), one time soda machine not working.  I swear everytime we want to order at this Milios' we are guaranteed something not working!!!  Including employees!!  This place needs serious help!"}
{"text":"Can you please move to San Diego? I went to UW and ate BIg Mike's a lot! The tuna is my favorite. It's unlike any other tuna sub I've had from other chain sandwich shops. The bread is fantastic. Can't comment on the prices since I haven't eaten here in years."}
{"text":"Amazing place, but REALLY small! Apparently you don't need a lot of room to make great sandwiches, though. They have so many menu items and the delivery is more than welcome. I live near this place and buy their day old bread quite a bit. Gift cards are a great choice. The cheese isn't the best, however, but that is crushed by all the pros of this tiny shop on Regent. Great meal any day!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the other reviewer meant by Milio's being their favorite spot. This food is just bland as can be. The bread is decent, and on par with Jimmy John's, but the rest of the ingredients are tasteless and all you can really taste is the mayo. I live very close, but I'll never resort to Milio's."}
{"text":"The employees seem very dirty and unprofessional,  especially the woman who is supposed to be the \"manager\" we've been in many times, add we live very close and milio's is one of our favorite places to eat,  but we've left every single time because of the all around appearance of the workers and the way that we've heard the management speak to the employees-they seem to be extremely patronized and treated/spoken to like they're idiots by the management and I just don't trust what someone tasted that way (especially looking that way) would do to the food to spite the people who seem to be making their lives, at work,  hell.  I would rather drive 3-4 miles where the employees seem clean and seem to be enjoying their job than to risk eating someone's spite-who-knows-what!"}
{"text":"Always speedy deliver to the office! They have gotten my order wrong a couple of times, but they always make it right! Friendly staff, always attentive.

My usual is a #4, with hots on the sandwich, easy on the mayo, no sprouts, yummy!!!!!

I also tend to enjoy the reeses cookies on occasion.

I'd love it if they had diet cherry soda available :) 

Tip: They have a drive thru at this location but it is kind of hidden (in case you're ever in a rush)"}
{"text":"Anemic portions of deli meat. I've had other, better experiences with the chain from other locations.

I like that you can substitute spinach as an option instead of lettuce and I've always favored their bread over Subways or Cousin's."}
{"text":"My favorite place to order sandwiches!  The food is always good, the delivery service is always on time.  And the employees are always so friendly."}
{"text":"I can't really explain my obsession with Milio's.  But I'll try.

By the way, if halfway through this, you realize that I am crazy and you don't want to hear any more, please feel free to stop reading.

I guess it's not only that I have this thing about cold sandwiches.  It's also the fact that there have been specific situations in which I had said sandwiches from Milio's that made them work for me.  By the way, this location in Monona is my favorite, because it was close to work (and Caribou coffee), but I have also had sandwiches from the ones on State Street as well as in Waunakee, and, not surprisingly, the results were almost identical.  It is a chain, after all.

The first time was when I was  at an all-day music recital with other teachers, and we were STARVING, and our boss was like, \"I'll order something.  Milio's?\"  I didn't even have the wherewithal to disagree, because I was so deliriously hungry, but when that sandwich was delivered to me, on a whole wheat bun, with lettuce, tomato, turkey, provolone, and SPROUTS....NOM NOM!  I thought it was the best thing in the entire world.

The next time was after I had run a 20K race in Monona.  The only thing I could think about from miles 10-12 were a Vanilla Light Cooler from Caribou, and a Milio's sandwich.  Good thing they are right next door to each other.

The third time was when I was moving.  Moving sucks, packing sucks, finding food to eat when you've packed everything to cook with sucks.  To Milio's I went.  And it was glorious.

I can't believe that Milio's is only a Wisconsin thing.  (Well, they also have them in Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota.  Yeah, I checked the website.)  I am mad. Very mad.  Jimmy John's is not the same.  No whole-wheat bread unless you want a regular sandwich and not a sub.  Hell naw!  I guess they have sprouts, but...meh.  I will deal with it.  But it ain't Milio's.

My husband thinks I'm crazy.  He hates Milio's, Jimmy John's, Subway, and everything like it.  He'll only order a cold sandwich if he goes to a Little Italy neighborhood and gets one with all the Italian meats and cheeses. 

My husband likes Quiznos, which I think is because they toast their sandwiches.  I hate Quiznos.  I once went there because I couldn't get to Milio's, and asked for the sandwich cold...and....not a good sandwich.   The toasting totally masks the fact that their bread sucks!.  

He just doesn't understand my obsession with Milio's.  I don't blame him, really, because Milio's is like the cold version of McDonald's.  But I don't care.  Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"I love this Milio's for the soul fact of it being a lovely local sandwich shop. I work just down the road from this place and frequent here enough for them to know me on a first-name basis. They are always OUTRAGEOUSLY fast which is great on a 30 min lunch break. The place is always clean and quiet and they are always really polite here. The sandwiches never taste stale or like the ingredients have been sitting out for a while unlike some of these locations.

It is a little small for it;s location in my opinion but I have never had to wait very long even if it were packed wall to wall here. When I don't have time to leave work, sometimes I have them delivered. They come right out and have only ONCE ever taken longer than 30 minutes to get to me. So therefore, this little Milio's is one of the best places for lunch or dinner on Madison's west side."}
{"text":"I want to like Milio's; they are everywhere - near work, home, appointments, etc. I rarely eat subs, but when I do it's because I'm craving a sandwichy goodness. The last few times, over the course of a couple years, the subs at Milio's have been very skinny. Even the large sized and priced subs are mediocre bread, although still better than Subway in my opinion, filled with few ingredients. This last time at the Eastpark Blvd location, we drove through and received an incorrect sub. My partner was heartbroken right off the bat for that road-trip (clearly he takes his subs seriously) as a result of receiving this incorrect, even skinnier, fake-bacon filled sub. In short, I prefer Jimmy Johns; they are plump and similarly priced."}
{"text":"This store has terrible customer servic and in general they have an archaic order system. I ordered online from them because I prefer to look at the menu and see it more customized. 
First of all they did not have any indication of which store served me, so I just picked the closest one, 1 mile away. After putting the order I was told the only way to pay by credit card is to have the delivery guy call the number in when they bring the sandwich - annoying but fine.
I waited for over 30 mins for the delivery, and after not hearing anything, I called the store. The guy had my order right there but after a minute told me that it's actually another store that delivers here. He gave me their number and said that my order would already be sent there.
I called the other store and was informed that they just received the order and it would take at least another 30 minutes to have it delivered. Mind you, this is all at 3:00 pm, by far net even close to their busy hours.
Why couldn't they call me right away and tell me that I ordered from the wrong store? They just ignored my order until I called. Also why lie and say the other store already had my order when he was just at that moment sending it over?
Extremely unprofessional and horribly disappointing. Now I will go right back to being a Jimmy John's customer."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch \"for later\" from this Milio's at a time 2-3 hours in the future. Instead, they brought it right away. Our office orders from them regularly. By the time I called them to let them know the mistake, we had consumed some of the food (a fountain soda, subs best eaten fresh). I told the person I spoke to that we hadn't wanted to wait and eat it after it had been sitting around for a couple of hours. They let us know that if we had called right away, they would have come and retrieved our lunches and then delivered fresh food at the correct time. I told them that we would rather not waste food. They did not offer to comp our lunch or offer any discount on a future meal because of the error. This is really not great customer service!! I use other food-ordering platforms at work and when there is an error with my order, the charge is taken off my card. I will use those restaurants instead in the future."}
{"text":"I love Milios, but this is the most annoying system. You order in the back, pay at the front, and go back to get your food. It's your normal, great Milio's subs, with a horrible system."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches taste the same at any Milio's. My bad review is in regards to delivery. We ordered sandwiches yesterday, and it took over an hour to get them. Basically that meant we didn't get a lunch hour. Ridiculous! Don't get delivery from this Milio's!"}
{"text":"While I love Milio's as a chain, I have to give this particular location a lower rating simply because it says they offer delivery and when you call to have it delivered, there are generally no delivery drivers on staff.  They always refer us to the Odana Rd. store, who, of course tries to refer us back to Commerce since it is closer.  It gets very frustrating.  I think Milio's has lost quite a bit of our business due to this, which is unfortunate.

As far as the staff in-store, they are friendly and efficient.  The sandwiches are always delicious and I definitely go for the bread.  YUMMMM.

If only they could solve the delivery issue, I'd be 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Love my sandwich love the person who took my order. On the other hand the lady who took my card. Not one word not even a thank you even when I said thank you, she just turned her head and and shut the window. That's why I gave two stars . Sorry"}
{"text":"Good for their simplicity, they have this cheapo little sandwich called a \"skinny\" that is just meat and bread.  Of course, if you want anything else on it they start jacking up the price, even for mayo or veggies.  Pretty good though for a quicky snack."}
{"text":"40 minutes for a call back to \"verify\" an order I placed online. Then another 45 minutes to make and deliver. Why don't you just start making my order when I order it? Also, you really shouldn't offer online ordering if you don't let customers pay online as well. Very inconvenient for a mediocre sandwich."}
{"text":"I LOVE Milios but I like this location a tad more because they have Diet Mt Dew on the soda machine (some others dont)  Subs are always delicious but the Cheesy tortilla soup is amaaaazing! ! Kasey who works here is awesome. Always friendly."}
{"text":"Food here is always very good! The employees are nice as well.  The only thing I wish they had is Diet Mt Dew on the soda machine not in bottles like the Milios has on the square.

They their roadhouse chili and especially the Southwestern cheesy chicken soup!"}
{"text":"I was there during a stormy, stormy day. The parking lot was flooded, as was most of the area. The staff sensed I was coming, rented 45 shop vacs, and sucked the water away in anticipation of my arrival. After which,  the staff was very wet from drying up all the rain, but they had the presence of mind to go to the back, make new (dry) work clothes out of discarded boxes, and sandwich wrappers so I would not be offended by their dampness, and also not have to even consider how uncomfortable they probably were. As I stood there dripping wet (as I am adult, and still not sure how rain works), the cashier went out of their way to shred all the fabric they could find and quickly weave several luxurious towels to hand pat dry myself and two children. Kudos! You went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"After reading a lot of bad reviews I decided to still give it a chance and order for delivery. I had to repeat my number 3 times and repeat my address spell it out twuce, I hear a women in the back ground say we need to check that address to make sure it's deliverable (quit rude might I add) so the guy puts me on hold for literally 5 mins to check. The rude women gets on the phone and asks for my address again and says it's not coming up. I tell her the name of my apts and that I only like 7 mins from their location. She VERY rudely says, \"uh I can appreciate that but we can't even deliver to some locations in Verona.\" I just hung up I couldn't believe the way she was talking to me and the frustrating awful costomer service they have. I will NEVER give them my business."}
{"text":"I have always had good experiences with Milios.  Even if they've messed up my order or I've had some other type of complaint they always make it right.  They definately know customer service and how to keep their customers happy and coming back."}
{"text":"I walked in to Milio's this evening and was instantly greeted by the sandwich barista saying, \"Welcome in! How are you?,\" standing in front of the register and smiling.  Made my crappy day a little better.  I ordered a Pilgrim's pride and it was delicious, hit the spot.  Will definitely be back for the friendly service and consistent Milio's quality."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches on great bread. Big Steer was good, although may have been better if it was served warm. Staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"$9.75 for a filling roast beef sandwich, bag of chips, chocolate chip cookie, and bottle of water.  Not Bad.
This location is about a block away from Subway.  I'm out in Madison for a conference (Chicago is home) and wanted something cheap, good, fast, and filling and I would say I got it!  This place is also similar to Jimmy John's but the sandwich was more filling.
The place was empty at dinner time, clean and efficient."}
{"text":"We frequent this particular Milio's when possible on work days. The staff is always friendly and orders are completed quickly.  Quality is always consistent whether you dine in, pick up or have it delivered. I do wish there was as more of a comfortable seating area but that factor doesn't stop us from returning."}
{"text":"Just ordered online to Cottage Grove location. Prompt call back for credit card payment. Courteous staff over the phone to tell me certain add-on snacks I selected were not available at their location. Quick delivery by another professional staff member CAN'T BEAT IT! Keep up the great work Milio's Cottage Grove!"}
{"text":"The bread was good but otherwise thoroughly disappointed. The turkey on my sandwich was literally one slice thick. Milio's might be a great option if your vegetarian!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and the nearest place to grab a quick bite without having to cross the beltline. Sure, lunch hour gets busy and you have to wait a little bit, but that's common sense. The workers are always super nice and the tables are always clean. I only wish they served soup year round!"}
{"text":"When I thought about a review I would write for Milio's I thought 'Meh. I've experienced better.' Oh wait, that's Yelp's 2 star indicator.

Well, it's true, I have experienced better - it reminded me of a Jimmy John's copycat. Except the bread was what they give away as 'day old'. I tried the #8 Big Steer and the meats and cheeses used seemed fresh. It was pleasant to eat - but I should be using adjectives like yummy, tasty, scrumptious, and even finger lickin'. But this meal was more or less fulfilling my need to not starve. It was a means to an end.

I do have to congratulate Milio's for their advertising campaign through their countless billboards along the beltline. I knew it was only a matter of time until I stopped in to see why I deserved a Milio's sandwich. It did it's job, it got me to come in, well done.

I won't be returning anytime soon. Oh, and this specific location was doing construction to their floor tiling, not only did I trip on the floor mat that was laying disheveled on the floor but so did the two customers that came in after me. What a lazy job they were doing in there."}
{"text":"My employees received extremely poor service. They forgot part of the order when it was delivered. My employee called and asked if they could bring the chips that were forgotten. Instead of apologizing, the person on the phone asked if the chips were actually on the receipt. Then she was told the driver didn't want to leave the store again. They had even given him a good tip to just drive down the street originally. Then the driver managed to show up, handed off the chips, and just said \"apologize,\" and walked out the door. We will never order from this company again."}
{"text":"MIlios absolutely never disappoints. They care reasonably priced, and quality care service. Even though they took away the zesty mayo, they are still without a doubt one of the best sub chains in the midwest. I appreciate the diversity and cleanliness of the space."}
{"text":"I should've went with jimmy johns two hours late plus up charge my card for a tip I didn't confirm"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Order is always quick and correct. Great place to grab a quick bite to eat on campus."}
{"text":"This review is for Milio's in general and not specifically this store location. I don't like Milio's and have never understood why people like these subs so much. They offer only one kind of bread for their subs --it's WHITE bread, Ugh. The subs are always so dry and tasteless. I had one at a work luncheon, so I didn't even have to pay for it and decided I would never go to Milio's. My supervisor ate at Milio's almost every day! Sorry, but these subs aren't good. Subway or Firemen's are much better."}
{"text":"Open late, delivers late, and high-quality. I'd never have gotten through my senior year without 'em."}
{"text":"Sandwichs are always fresh and delicious. 
Staff is friendly and service is fast. 
Been here several times. 
Wish they had soup all year and a few more choices."}
{"text":"Order arrived in a timely fashion. No errors. My only suggestion would be to pack the hot soup separately from the cold sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a split personality. When I have ordered through the drive-through (which I don't recommend if you have a large SUV or aren't so good with the steering) the sandwiches came exactly as ordered and the window person was very friendly (there was one guy who was *really* friendly, which was amusing and flattering to a middle-aged mom in a minivan). But the last two or three times I have gotten delivery the order was wrong. 

The last time I got delivery two of the three sandwiches were COMPLETELY wrong. (Once time I used the website and ordered my sandwich without avocado because my GI tract just can't tolerate the stuff and it came with all kinds of avocado. Grrrr.) I called back as soon as I discovered it and was told that the driver had packed the bag wrong. Honestly, I didn't care who screwed up - I just wanted my #13 on french! The person on the phone didn't seem too bothered by it, either. 

Once I got the correct sandwiches they were very good, but the experience left a bitter taste."}
{"text":"I really love milio's subs. This was the first day in a long time that my order was correct.  Me and my co-workers order from this store at least twice a month and it never fails our order is wrong. But as a  loyal customer I continue to order. Milio's receive so much business from our agency the least they could do is get the order right."}
{"text":"For a quick sandwich it is pretty hard to beat Milio's.  Their recently run, and unfortunately ended, Mediterranean sandwiches were amazing.  I still have dreams about the veggies hummus with the Mediterranean relish \"schug\" added in for a little extra kick.

The ingredients are always taste nice and fresh and the staff has welcoming.  Be sure try the cookies and the big ass pickle."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite. Order was correct. Tuna the Charlie could use a little more tuna but can't complain since I got a great Hooked deal."}
{"text":"How old is the tuna here?

On two occasions, I've ordered tuna sandwiches that came with inedible tuna. Yes, tuna is a fish, but when it has an overly fishy flavor that even makes a fish lover spit it out, something is wrong. I took the sandwiches home with me on both occasions, so I wasn't able to ask Milio's to prep something different for me. 

I don't recommend this Milio's. I've had tasty sandwiches before at other Milio's locations but consistent bad luck at this location."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, reliable tastes, a gazillion locations, delivery, quick and easy meals"}
{"text":"One of the sandwiches we received in our lunch order was completely wrong, we called to resolve the situation and order a new sandwich,  I asked to talk with the manager...the gal who answered the phone sighed loudly and stated tons of attitude that right now we're a little busy.  I responded that we just picked up our order and it was wrong and I'd like to correct it and I again got the sigh with attitude.

I tried contacting corporate, however their email address listed on their website isn't functioning and the phone number they have listed on their website is disconnected.

Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Super fast service, and really friendly workers. 
My only beef with this place is the location, but not much you can do about that. Parking lot always has spots, and you can park on the street behind the shop, but crossing the busy road can be a pain at times."}
{"text":"Fantastic location!  The staff is so friendly!  Seriously, they always have a smile on their face.  It is kind of weird to say that it is a chain because it feels like a neighborhood sandwich place.

Otherwise, this is your run of the mill Milio's."}
{"text":"Always fast service! And always excellent customer service. Nate LOVES his job and he is genuinely nice and personable to every customer every time I go in there. He is definitely an asset to their company."}
{"text":"Milio's is a pretty good Madison-based sandwich shop. Their spot on East Campus Mall in Madison is always busy, but the staff do their best to get you in and out of line reasonably quickly. 

I've tried their American Favorite (ham and Swiss), roast beef and turkey sandwiches. The ham and turkey are both really good, though the beef was tough and chewy."}
{"text":"Now known as Milio's....different name, same sandwiches.  Yummy...and they deliver!  I dont' like pizza....so this is definitely my choice convenience food!  It sucks that they only includ lettuce and tomato...but the bread is great, which is key.  I love the Pilgrim's Pride.  They are pretty heavy on the mayo...so watch out."}
{"text":"The good: it's cheap, and it was located within a very short walking distance from my hotel.  The bread was pretty good, and the chocolate chip cookie wasn't bad.

The bad: the lettuce on my veggie sandwich wasn't very good--it was the yellow stuff in the middle of a head of iceberg.  I asked for no mayo, and most of my sandwich had no mayo.  By the time I got to the last few bites, it was pretty clear that someone had forgotten my no mayo request and started to slather the mayonnaise on that end of the bread.  The cheese slices on my sandwich were very thin, and I only knew that the promised guacamole was on there because I caught a glimpse of a little bit of it--I didn't really taste it.  

Also--apparently you can make your sandwich \"skinny\" by not putting veggies on it, and they'll charge you less?  This is one of the strangest promotions I've ever seen, but I guess if you hate vegetables, you should come here."}
{"text":"Because the weather was great today! Soccer d is an idiot. It is okay for the server to be soaking wet while she isn't rolling you dry off from parking your car."}
{"text":"Super quick and fast service! The worker was spot on and super friendly! WILL ALWAYS COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"My first Milio's experience. The Milio's founder is cousins with the Jimmy John's founder, so you'll see immediate similarities off the bat. 

I went with The Big Steer and it was awesome. The two main differences I noticed from Jimmy John's is that the bread seemed softer and they use less meat. The second sounds like a bad thing, but it really makes for a better balanced sandwich overall. 

I'm now a big Milio's fan, and it might be my favorite sandwich chain. 

This location was a good one. Friendly staff and clean interior."}
{"text":"The subs are a joke.  I remember when this chain was called Big Mikes and the subs were BIG. Now they have paper thin slices of meat and mostly your buying bread and lettuce.  Then they charge you for mayo. Absolute rip off. Amazing how easily people are fooled. Guess thats why they are so profitable. They were smart to slowly decrease portion size over time, most people have no memory of how this chain started on University Ave with rhe best subs I ever had. SAD."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches and fast delivery! What more could you ask for? I have ordered delivery and gotten sandwiches to go from here for years and they don't disappoint. Far better than Jimmy John's! I will be back for for sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Pure suckage.  Tiny sandwich for the price with limited customizations.  Seems like they're trying to poorly imitate Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"The Californian sandwich is amaaaazing. Whether it's fresh or I left it in the fridge and ate it hours later, still very tasty!"}
{"text":"Tastes like a jimmy johns but not as good. Figures though, since the founder is jimmy johns cousin."}
{"text":"Out of the tons of sub places to choose from, I constantly find myself going back to Milios.  The fresh veggies, freshly sliced meats and awesome bread choices make it a standard lunch location.  My favorite sub is the Californian!  Gotta love guac and sprouts.  I also love the day old loafs to take home and make garlic bread. The staff at the junction road location is second to none.  They have amazing consistency so i know my order will be up to par.  Soups on in the winter and the special subs in the summer keep me coming back. Thanks milios for being awesome and convenient and reasonably priced at the same time!!"}
{"text":"I loved going to this place for lunch every week when I lived around there and I miss it so much. I wish they would open a Milios in Chicago. The bread is so tasty and I love how they put sprouts on the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Rating five stars because the food is amazing, especially when I'm not putting my children's lives at risk to drive through a tornado to get a sandwich. The food is even more delicious when I try it because some moron was angry that RAIN IS WET. 

Hope you read this, Soccer D. 

Rain. Is. Wet."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving a generic chain five stars. But, this is one of the few places in the food wasteland that is the East Towne area that has food that's palatable.

Plus, the service is amazing. They're so fast that I don't bother sitting down when I'm waiting for my order, because they'll call me back before I get to my chair. Every staff member I've run into has been incredibly friendly and helpful. On slow days, I've had people offer me free bread that they were going to toss. The second time I showed up here, the guy recognized me from the last time, gave me a punchcard, and puched out the first two entries.

Food-wise, the service here is one of the few things I'm going to miss when I move from the far east side."}
{"text":"Five stars, because the staff are clearly a bunch of saints who put up with ridiculous demands. I see nothing \"unprofessional\" about a business's parking lot being flooded. Hell, unless they own the property instead of renting, the state of the parking situation is probably completely out of their control."}
{"text":"This store is great because it has a drive through.  So if you are in a hurry consider stopping by here for some subs.  One word of warning though.   Their whole wheat bread does not taste good at all to us.  Maybe it's us but we think it totally sucks.   The french bread is very good though.   Once in a while they have gone too light on the sauce too.  So if you like mayo or another sauce be sure to ask for it or you may have a pretty dry sandwich.
Went back again and the meat was skimpy.  Way less meat on the sandwiches than what was once standard.  Like any good sub shop they go downhill after a few years and then start serving you sub par subs.
The last few times I've been here they've improved. The bread is fresh The portions are a little better again."}
{"text":"What happened to the blond woman with the big smile who was always so speedy and friendly.   She wasn't there today and due to poor service I didn't place an order.
Milio's subs are the best in town.   The prices are good too.  But today things were not so smooth and after waiting a while I left.  I hope they didn't lose their fantastic server and worker behind the counter with the great attitude."}
{"text":"Today must have been a busy day for them because when I came in they said they were out of bread.  Really?  A sandwich shop running out of bread.  That's terrible."}
{"text":"I didn't have cash for the food cart i wanted to eat at. and the bank ATM wanted a 5 dollar fee. so wandered here thinking it would suffice. bad call.

sandwich was kinda like a bad quizno's or something. just kinda not much to it. 2.5 stars maybe. 

but after ordering and paying a huge cockroach wandered across the kitchen floor. chilled a bit, and moved on. probably made the sandwich taste worse cause it ruined everything for me. 

maybe its normally OK. but after having a delicious meatball sub for lunch from a cart the day before i thought the whole experience was a waste of a meal."}
{"text":"They take great care of East Madison Toyota. Always prompt and friendly. Food is what you'd expect. Bread is way better then Subway"}
{"text":"Milio's, formerly called \"Big Mikes,\" is A-OK. Their french bread is super fantastic as part of any of their subs. I like the veggie with oil and vinegar added. 

The location during the school year can be a nightmare, especially if you're dumb enough to go there around the high school's lunch time. There are tons of teenagers walking all over the place letting their huge sense of self entitlements hang out. 

The parking lot has some seriously awesome potholes. It's like goin' off roadin' to the drive thru. Speaking of which, the drive thru is narrow, and I can't help but wonder how many geniuses have driven back through there and either committed a curb shot or side swiped that rickety old fence. I know I have! Or am I kidding?? 

The only Milio's mystery bigger than this is their amazing employee turnover. Though, keep in mind I'm not really complaining, cuz most everyone that works there is cute and worthy of my cheek pinchin' antics. 

I've never been inside this location, but that's because they lock the doors when they see me 4-wheelin' through the parking lot and bouncing teenagers off my hood."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Milio's in Verona for many years and they continue to offer a great selection of sandwiches with quick service.  I love their new menu options and store remodel."}
{"text":"This little sandwich shop has a great selection of subs including some modern tastes.  I got a California something, it was turkey with avocado and some other vegetables.  The portion was huge.  It was fresh and delicious and the price was definitely a steal for the amount of food."}
{"text":"If you want to overpay for not much food that has no special elements this is your place. I've put off writing this hoping for better outcomes but a dozen times in its substandard still. $6 for a basic sub that's size is due to air in the bread. Couple slices of processed turkey. Charge you for a large drink/combo when you ask for a small. Still hungry after. Take the extra five minutes to go a little out of your way to hit one of the other sandwich shops in the area."}
{"text":"Milios is one of my favorite sub shops. Simple sandwiches with fresh, soft bread. This location has never gotten my order wrong and is tidy. 

My order is- godfather with light mayo. Would recommend if you like Italian subs, but also it can be messy so grab extra napkins. 

The space is not very large but usually has enough seating; at lunch time it might get busy as it's right by a business park. This location closes pretty early, check the hours if you plan on coming on weekends or weeknights."}
{"text":"I must be getting old as I still refer to Milio's as Big Mike's (the name before the switch).  Yes, you can still get day old bread and I am still a fan of their subs (looking at you, longhorn!).  Good bread, good toppings, good meat-what more do you want?  The fact they are open until 3 am each night is also a huge plus for those nights where you are looking for a late night munch."}
{"text":"I LOVE Milio's. They're for sure my go to sub shop. The delivery range is kind of small so I've never been able to get delivery and can't attest to the speed of that. The pick up is always ready by the time I get there though. I can't remember a time where my order was messed up, but I can't say for certain it hasn't happened. If it has, it hasn't been often enough or much of a hassle.

I used to go to Jimmy John's all the time and thought of Milio's as the lesser version. Man was I wrong. The quality here is much better. I love the bread. The perfect amount of soft insides and hard crust. Occasionally the end is a little harder than I like, but it's not too often. I really recommend getting the bread left in. I find not doing so to be a bit lacking. I can understand the other reviewer's complaints about it not being enough.

They also give you plenty of guacamole! I always feel like other places are a rip off with the amount they give.

Also try the cookies! I love the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut. They're always soft and fresh."}
{"text":"Shockingly delicious! I ordered an Italian Club and had it delivered to my hotel room. It reminded me of Jimmy John's, which I enjoy, but Milio's meat quality was much better than Jimmy John's. The bread was almost the same, but slightly more \"homemade\" tasting. The delivery was prompt & professional. I used their website to place my order, and it was an easy to follow process. Well done!"}
{"text":"Avoid.  I stopped in for lunch-on-the-go and ended up regretting it.  While waiting in line for over 10 minutes to place my order as other hopeful customers queued up behind me--FYI I was the first customer in line, and yes they saw me--I had a rare opportunity to observe my surroundings.
   Ambience: Dingy and dark aka mood lighting for parolees and cockroaches.
   Employees: lackluster floor-gazers with questionable hygeine.  One licked her glove to help open it before placing it over her hand.
   Manager: Questionable.  Loudly instructed employees not to take any more orders until they finished fulfilling prior requests.  (There were at least three people back there--why couldn't one take orders while the other 2+ filled those orders?)  She also thought that calling me Baby Girl would keep me waiting in line.  She was wrong as I ended up ditching the line and instead buying a few items at the nearby gas station."}
{"text":"I order from this location roughly twice a month, and whether I get my food delivered, through the drive-thru, or inside the restaurant, my order is always correct and the sandwiches are consistent. Service is friendly and fast. I love that they have Diet Mountain Dew, and if you haven't tried the wraps, I highly recommend the jalapeño cheddar. It gives your sandwich that extra something something. I'm also a fan of the limited time special subs. It's cool to try new sandwiches, and the Sicilian was particularly good, it has pesto!"}
{"text":"I've gotten seriously sick twice from eating there. The first time I thought it was a fluke. The second time was the same as the first so I knew that their food was the issue."}
{"text":"Sssslllloooowwww....

You'll never be disappointed in the food. I've never had a sandwich that was below expectations. Ordering online is an issue, though. Three online orders and they're one for three on getting that sandwich delivered in less than 40 minutes, and I only live 6 blocks away. On one particular order, when I called after 30 minutes, they admitted to completely neglecting the online order printout they get.

I've resigned myself to the fact that, if I want Milios, I'm going to get in the car and drive there and back. This alone will likely take half the time than ordering online."}
{"text":"Milo's was good and convenient to our hotel.  Just read that the founder is a cousin of the Jimmy John's founder and it all makes sense now...... because it tastes just like Jimmy John's!  Neither are my favorite sandwich locations, but it was fresh and provided a nice, quick lunch."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? But my #4 pilgrim on a jalepeno-cheddar wrap tasted like lunch room food. Minimal flavor-- jalepeno cheddar is a huge overstatement. And almost $9 for a meal? I'll pass."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. 

 I order online, which say they deliver to me. They call me up 15 minuets later and say they don t have a driver at all today.
They say i can come pick it up, and don't offer any form of apology or compensation to maybe make me happy.
The whole point is i wanted a sub that could be delivered, Thats why i ordered it.
That was the Whole point.  

Very Disappointed.

Clearly they need to hire more people. Both drivers and Customer service specialists."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my first experience at the Sun Prairie location and the online ordering option. Never received my food. rude staff with no accommodation. I'm never one to bash a restaurant because everyone has a bad day,  but this was upsetting in the least."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I haven't been to any milios in at least 10 years... now I remember why. First off, I tried ordering delivery, but it was going to be 45 minutes to come down the street at 11:30 am on a Friday so I just told her I'd come pick up my meal. I did so and the cashier took my money and told me it would be a minute... ok but can I at least have my soda cup? She then gave it to me so I could fill it up. I started filling my cup and noticed there was some black stuff floating in it and asked for a new one. Luckily this time I was given a clean cup - but beware of how tiny their straws are. I take my sandwich home and open it up. It was the most unappetizing sandwich I've ever seen. Wilted almost brown shredded iceburg lettuce  a few extremely thin pink looking tomatoes, 2 extremely thin slices of provolone cheese, and maybe some ham it was hard to tell. Wait, I paid 6 dollars for THIS???? I was so disappointed I drove back and expressed my anger. I had to leave for work in a half an hour so this was definitely out of my way and not on my agenda but there was no way I was paying for something this terrible. The cashier apologized and made me a new sandwich, I opened it up, it looked the same. I told them they should replace their lettuce and that I couldn't believe anyone was being charged this amount of money for what they are given. He then started reciting how many grams of lettuce etc they put on their sandwiches - cut the crap milios. 

In short - SAVE YOURSELF SOME DISAPPOINTMENT AND GO TO JIMMY JOHNS. You will get more bang for your buck and it will actually taste good and be FRESH. 

It is safe to say I will never be back."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered at 11:03 am, and it is currently 1:06 pm and I still haven't gotten my food. Unbelievable. I called twice. Once after an hour, and the second time after 2 hours. Both times woman said food was on the way. SMH.

UPDATE: Food got here at 1:29 pm. I like when my orders get delivered in 2.5 hours. Lightning fast."}
{"text":"There are much better places to have a sub sandwich... Not very impressed.."}
{"text":"I luv Big Mike subs, I miss it a LOT since I moved to CA. They are simple and plain, the only added ingredients are lettuce, tomato and mayo. Next time I come for a visit, I will order to deliver for sure..."}
{"text":"Just my two cents-when they started in Madison on the 90's and they were \"Big Mike's\" they were terrific.
Now, they suck.
I'm hoping Jersey Mike's come to town-much better!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy and fresh - a perfect lunch for my family and I. We had a turkey and a veggie and both tasted very fresh. The bread is definitely the best part - so so good and just enough bread without it being bready...a good find!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, the staff are friendly and deliveries are always less than a half hour. Delivery crew are friendly and very polite. Love these guys, food is fresh and I feel it is plenty. Dog and I share the meat."}
{"text":"Terrible service 
East towne location faces them my order because there location doesn't deliver to my office. Website didn't say that when ordering but either way ordered sub at 11:15 had to call east towne since they didn't call me on either number I listed I my order to tell me about this. Manager says she sent east park my order by fax to take care of me ? It is 12:40 and I still have no sub I even faced that location since I can't take calls during work but they still never called me and 2 phone numbers were listed on the fax to call 

Terrible service 

Thanks for no lunch today really appreciate that"}
{"text":"Terrible service placed order online at 11:15 waited 30 mins called them and they tell me that they don't deliver to my location website says nothing about that even sent me an email . Manager tells me they faxed my order to the location that can get me my order it is 12:36 and I still have no sandwich for my lunch. I even sent a fax to the east park location asking were my sub was but no answer 

Guess I get no lunch today THANKS ALOT"}
{"text":"I have had a good experience every time I've been here (except for the time condensation from my six pack got it wet in my backpack). 

BUT, they charge $0.50 for East Coast hot peppers. They don't need to be free (which would be nice and worth 2 more stars) but $0.50 for a spoon of peppers is too much. 

When I add peppers, I make them swipe my Amex again for the upcharge which probably costs them more than the peppers cost me as a big middle finger to them."}
{"text":"Typical Milio's food, not great, not horrible, thoroughly mediocre. Where they lose points is speed of delivery. Which makes sense when seems they've always got a hiring sign out front. Still, I find it a bit sad when Jimmy John's delivers to me faster when they're farther away. So with this location, I'd refrain from delivery if you want a timely, \"good enough\" sub sandwich. Otherwise, typical chain sub shop, in my opinion, which means, don't expect much and you won't get disappointed too much."}
{"text":"heck yeah.

I think the secret lies in the bread.  White or wheat, it'll disappear quickly."}
{"text":"I was extremely delighted with my experience at Milo's this morning, the staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Decent place, quick service, variety of subs, drive thru is always quick. Food tastes great all the time."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero on delivery I would...i have been waiting an hour for my sandwich. This is the second time this has happened from the same location, will never order from this location again. I am a loyal Milio's costomer and they are always speedy, sometimes less than 20 minutes. I don't understand why is takes so long!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Second time I have tried to get food delivered and they say they don't have a driver at this time.  Drive thru is horrible as well and slow.  Subway, here I come."}
{"text":"Super quick and friendly service! The restaurant is kept fairly clean (keep in mind that they service mostly college students and most of the workers are college students). The bread is fresh and soft! The prices are pretty cheap for lunch time food. For a smaller location, there's plenty of seating inside. There is a very large outdoor seating area on east campus mall that is perfect for nice days. Lots of traffic on east campus mall, so it's like a show while you eat your meal. Love the turkey and italian subs!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat at BIG mike's. I ate at Milio's. I don't know which location, but it was downtown in amongst the UW campus and State buildings. It was very cold that day, around 19 degrees. So, I will just post my review here. It was good! I had the Pilgrim. What a novel idea, keep the sandwich simple and make it good (why don't you learn something Subway!) I highly recommend Milio's, and I highly recommend very little."}
{"text":"The worker at the counterwas unphased because she's been watching the parking lot and sidewalk continue to flood throughout her shift. Probably wondering who would be crazy enough to park in a flooded lot for a sandwich. Five stars for them staying open for ungrateful customers."}
{"text":"I ordered a sub from this location. I ordered it at 2:36pm and did not recieve it until around 3:45pm. I called them around 3:30 and was told its on my way to my house. Didn't get the sub til 15-20min later and i live down the street from it. This isn't the first time it has taken over an hour to get my sub. I just felt i should give them another chance because i love Milio's. To top it off, i was told the bread is fresh (i didn't ask, i was just randomly told by the driver). The bottom of it was hard as a rock and it cut the bottom of mouth everytime i took a bite. Will not be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"After placing my order online I was called 10 min later saying my food will be delivered in 30 min. Great so far. Well an hour later I get a call saying they were here and no one answered. Hmmmm..... My instructions clearly stated the office is open. Driver apparently had to leave and food arrived an hour and 15 minutes later. Love milios but won't get delivery again."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly. Their sandwiches hit the spot. The portion size is perfect. The godfather is especially tasty. Who needs Subway when there is a Milio's."}
{"text":"Really dry sandwiches. Slow service. Every Milio's I've been to has been 4x better than this. Just bad."}
{"text":"I bet this place makes a killing on the high schoolers over the lunch hour.  That's got to be their primary reason for existence.  Great location for them.  It was convenient for us with an indoor soccer even there, so we grabbed a quick lunch between games.

You'll get your standard Milio's sandwiches here.  Good stuff - consistent with what you would get at any Milio's.  The folks there were pretty nice.  The place was clean.  Hard to complain.  

This is a great place to get a tasty, safe sandwich. If you're looking for something unique and/or UH-mazing, there are lots of other places to explore."}
{"text":"Posting five stars because even though there were full on twisters in the area this amazing business stayed open and served their guests even when they were soaking wet"}
{"text":"We have used Milo's for boating lunches and just an easy lunch at home. The sandwiches are great and they always pay great attention to the details, no pickles etc.,  which is appreciated.  They deliver which makes it easier in this fast pace world. Thanks."}
{"text":"If you like waiting over an hour for the wrong order, go for it. This is the worst Milios of all time for sure. I love milios but this one is trash. I live one mile away and it takes an hour and a half for them to deliver each time, and each time the order had the wrong food in it. They should just close this place, it's worthless."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in the Madison area, for work.  Rarely will I go a week without stopping at Milio's for some soup.  They have the best brown chicken and wild rice, on the planet!  I stopped off just a little while ago, to get some, but had to wait.  I have never had to wait before, but I didn't care, that soup is worth the wait.  I asked them if they had been busier than normal.  They said they hadn't, but there was a big guy that clean them out.  Curious, I asked them about this guy.  It was a big burly dude wearing a black jacket, grey sweater, and jeans.  He was tall, and very loud.  He ordered soup, ate it at the counter, handed them the bowl back and yelled, \"MORE!\"  They gave his more, he wasn't even eating it with silverware, he was downing bowls of soup like shots.  He just kept yelling, \"MORE!\" until it was all gone.  I asked if that was all he said, and they said, as he was leaving, he turned around and yelled, like the incredible Hulk. \"Hank likes soup!\"  I should have known.  I recommend Milio's.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed with my experience at Milio's. 

I stopped in over lunch while in Monona on a business trip. You can find it off Broadway next to Papa Murphy's. The place was busy, which is great for business. Unfortunately the staff didn't seem to be able to handle the lunch rush of customers. I ordered my sandwich and waited close to 10 minutes before it was ready. Need I mention this is supposed to be fast food?

I ordered a simple ham sandwich on wheat, #1 American Favorite on the menu. The bread was good and tasted fresh, but sadly that was the best part. There was more mayo and lettuce on the sandwich than meat and it was hard to eat. 

Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"Milio's Sandwiches is the national chain of a sandwich shop for the local \"Big Mike's Subs\" that first started in Madison. They have simple, but tasty sandwiches (all cold, non-toasted) but they taste fresh and are very reasonably priced for their size. Service is fast and the bread is great. For those who are more concerned with price or size, they offer a \"Skinny\" version of each sandwich. The only draw back is that the menu is relatively limited, but what they do offer is tasty!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the sandwich. I paid 10$ for a sandwich that was maybe 7 inch and was very skimpy. The sandwich tasted good but I really wish the sandwich was worth spending this money. Very upset about it."}
{"text":"Had Milio's for a working lunch. I'm not typically a fan of delivered food, but these guys did it right!

The order was on the money, the food was fresh and good.... what more can you ask!!"}
{"text":"If you judge sandwiches based on bread, this place is great!  Actually, I had the Veggie delight and it was a great sandwich. Perfect bread, sprouts added a great touch to an already good avocado and veggie sandwich. Highly recommended place in Middleton."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start by saying this is one of the few places that deliver where we live, so we've given Milio's many chances. On the rare chance that the order shows up in a timely matter or that it's correct, it's good. Majority of the deliveries we've ordered from here have been wrong, very late, or not even delivered to us at all. Once ordered from here and the delivery driver called me and told me he \"left our subs outside\" when I didn't answer the door. The problem was they never even came to the right house, so we never got the order we waited over an hour and a half for. Would not recommend delivery from this location. They don't have drivers after 4pm most days anyway. It's a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I love Milio's! It's delicious and super SPEEDY! 

They say JJ is Freaky Fast, but I think Milio's beats JJ every time. Not to mention, they taste better too! ;) 

But, in all seriousness, Milio's is fantastic. We order from them all the time at my office. They have a really nice selection of sandwiches, everyone is able to find something they like. I am a big fan of their lettuce wraps! They just taste so good! Fresh, crisp, with a bit of a crunch. Yum! 

They also have awesome soups available. Their chili is one of my favorites, even though it gives me heartburn. (Darn tomato based anything!) I just wish the soup was available all year. I get it, lots of people probably don't want soup in the summer -- but when you work in an office building that keeps the AC so low you feel like it's winter year-round, soup sure would hit the spot! 

Good price, good service, delicious food. Can't go wrong!"}
