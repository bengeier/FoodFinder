{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed. A friend told us about it and he wasn't wrong. We had the souvlaki sticks. The meat was grilled to perfection and super tender. potatoes were also very good. The tomatoes tasted like real tomatoes and not like the wet cardboard tomatoes available at this time of year. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"We discovered this place as we were biking up Parc to find a place to eat in Parc-X; it's in a strange location and we had never noticed it before.  We ordered eggplant spread and potato-garlic spread as appetizers; both were very fresh and tasted of excellent ingredients.  We then shared a salad of shredded romaine, escarole, green onion and dill with a vinaigrette; again it was very fresh and tasted of summer.  Finally, we had grilled lamb chops and a grilled half chicken; both were amazing, particularly the lamb which was from Quebec and was incredibly delicate and flavourful.  We are giving the restaurant five stars because it is such an excellent value -- everything was excellent quality and very well prepared and yet moderately priced.  The restaurant seems to be run by a greek family who are very friendly and welcoming; our waiter came over to actually get to know us and talked with us for a while.   They told us that it's often very busy Friday and Saturday night so it's best to reserve. We are definitely going back very soon!"}
