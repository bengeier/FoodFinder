{"text":"Je suis allée au Restaurant Carte Blanche un samedi soir avec un groupe d'amis notre réservation étais a 19h nous avons attendu 2 heures avant de recevoir nos assiettes. Le service était très long! Nous avons dû répéter plusieurs fois avant d'avoir notre sceau d'eau pour le vin et nos menu et la même chose pour l'eau. 
Pour se qui est de la bouffe j'ai commande le saumon il était bon sans plus...
Le fait que c'est un apportez votre vin est un plus.
En conclusion beau restaurant, apportez votre vin est un plus, mais le service très lent  et la nourriture n'est pas extraordinaire."}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge told us about Carte Blanche, as we wanted excellent food as well as to be able to open a superb premier cru Burgundy we brought. The food surpassed our expectations- unique dishes like scallop ceviche (I would call it scallop sashimi) and kangaroo tartare showed care in preparation, high quality ingredients, and beautiful presentation. The fact our server knew a lot about wine (unusual for a BYOW) was a bonus, so we shared a glass with him. Overall, top flight on the price:quality ratio. Dinner (3 courses) was a prix fixe of C$47, + $5 extra as we ordered a plate of 3 delicious Quebec cheeses for dessert and the venison as a main."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant this past weekend while in town for a short vacation and the food absolutely blew us away.  It was one of the best meals we've ever had.  Great presentation, the atmosphere was great, and the waiter was very helpful.  We would highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Rien de spectaculaire! Service courtois mais sans plus. Nous avons opté pour la pieuvre, le Parmentier  de canard et la morue qui est un filet soit dit en passant. Correcte sans plus. Avoir une choix... Pas de retour pour nous. Faites votre opinion...ah oui personne ne nous a servit notre vin... Et oui l'histoire du micro onde est vrai... Il sonne tout le temps"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Montréal for a few days and this was the restaurant for our last nice dinner together. We found it online and were surprised that there seemed to be little reviews, but we wanted to try some French cuisine.

The restaurant was a bit of a walk for us form our hotel in the chilly weather, but it was worth it. The atmosphere was romantic and classy all at the same time.

We were greeted with a tasty menu. Having a later reservation, we were the last table to be eating, but the staff made no indication or pressure for us to leave. They were very keen to see that we had a great meal.

The food was amazingly prepared and left us pleasantly full and happy. We were particularly pleased with their vegetable soup and their dessert sampler.

Great Food, Great Wine and Awesome Atmosphere."}

{"text":"Nous y sommes allées dans le cadre de Montréal à table et avons été très satisfaites de notre soirée.
D'abord, le service a été très bon, et je tiens à le souligner car ce n'est pas toujours le cas pendant Montréal à table.
Ensuite, il s'agit d'un resto Apportez votre vin, ce qui est toujours agréable pour ne pas payer 60$ une bouteille qui en vaut 15...
La bouffe était délicieuse, les entrées très raffinées, le plat (nous avons pris le sanglier) copieux (ce qui n'est pas le cas dans tous les restos de ce standing) et le dessert vraiment bon (pannacotta).
Le cadre est beau, propre, sans trop de déco ni de lumière. Il y a juste ce qu'il faut. Parfait pour une soirée entre amis ou une soirée intime.
J'y retournerai surement! D'ici là, à vous de l'essayer! :)"}
{"text":"The chefs tasting menu was a real treat. Getting to try unique dishes like the scallop civeche are so much fun. The space is cozy and staff was very attentive. All combined for a great evening"}
{"text":"Easily the worst restaurant we ate at in Montreal.
We started with oysters. They looked shriveled and off-color, one appeared so butchered we didn't want to eat it.
I ordered the salad from the Table d'hôte \"Gastro\" menu. It was just rocket with too much dressing and small raisins which just fell through to the bottom of the plate (gravity always wins).
The fish was dry and overcooked and the \"risotto\" was just mushy under-cooked rice.
We also heard a microwave beep 7 or 8 times while we ate and there was an ant on our bread.
I feel like I got hustled out of $150."}
{"text":"For our first dinner in Montreal, a friend selected Carte Blanche based on some excellent reviews on other sites.  It's a quiet. beautifully designed contemporary restaurant, a bit out of the way, but well worth a short walk.  Either of the two price fixe options, at $25 and $35 are great deal, and since we were a group of eight, we sampled just about all the items on both of them. There is a small, but well-selected wine list.

We were pleased with the inventive cuisine, although more detail on the menu may have led us  to make other choices.   For example, the vegetable soup was pureed and served cold, not at all what we were expecting on a dreary, rainy night.  I also enjoyed my veal ravioli topped with foie gras but if I had known that they were served in a broth, I might not have ordered both  soups.   Overall, though, we were pleased with Carte Blanche, and would be happy to come back again."}
{"text":"Carte Blanche has been open 11 years and lately has turned into a BYO bottle of wine dinner experience.  This was our first time dining here. Two local friends and I had each different meals: bavette steak, tuna steak, and salmon.  All were prepared well - perfectly done. The appetizers were very good also. We had the soup, salmon tartare and a shiitake mushroom appetizers.  Serving sizes were ample but not overly done. We were satisfied with the appetizer and meal so didn't have dessert. No fee for BYOB.  We ordered items individually but they have specials for appetizer, meal and dessert and also a tasting menu also. 

It was a nice surprise for us and we enjoyed our meal and time at Carte Blanche.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Vraiment rien de spectaculaire, la bisque était tiède, fade, et beaucoup trop liquide. Suite à ce commentaire le chef m'a dit qu'au Québec on ne savait pas faire des bisques et qu'en France c'était un bouillon et qu'il n'y avait pas de crème (syndrome du tout est mieux en France). 

J'ai ensuite pris un steak-frites qui venait avec une salade, mais celle-ci était absente de l'assiette. Je l'ai fait remarqué à la serveuse qui ensuite m'a dit que c'est parce qu'il n'y en avait plus. Il aurait fallu me le dire avant et offrir autre chose, pas après. J'ai donc mangé mon steak-frites avec un restant de ratatouille (même chose pour ma blonde avec son tartare).

Une première et dernière fois."}
{"text":"Thank God the waiter was nice! Other than that, it would of been 1 or 1/2 star...

The menu is ok nothing new since the early 90's. We started of with stale bread with butter, olive oil and burn in your throat balsamic vinegar. Then Felix ordered the kangaroo tatar as an appetizer and the flank steak. I ordered the grilled octopus for the appetizer and the braised lamb shank. So... The tartar was so overwhelmed with the taste of green onions and capers that the kangaroo was nowhere to be found. The tiny green salad was useless. The grilled octopus was yes, tender but seemed more braised and lacked that smoky flavour that you would get if it was grilled well. It sat on top of oily well cooked but too salty vegetables. Plus, my plate had dried food from the previous seating. 

20 minutes later...

The flank steak excellent cooking temperature! Small. No. Really small. Buried by caramelized onions. Felix had to toss some on the side. Ughh! The useless salad again! Fries were crispy and tender inside. Just like we like them. But then again. How hard is it to make fries? My so called \"5 hours\" braised lamb shank felt more like a \"2 hours\" braised lamb shank. It came with a piece of carrot, a piece of orange bell pepper with the skin still on it and some green beans. The sauce tasted like powdered sauce and there was very little on both mains. They also sprinkled some Montreal steak spice all over! Trust me. I grew up with a father that would use it like cocaine! I know when it is being used!!! I didn't finish my plate.

45 minutes later...

They remembered that we wanted to share a cheese plate. It came. I had to flag the waitress so she could describe the cheeses to us. The \"homemade\" raspberry compote tasted more like it came from a tub. But the tiny pieces of cheese were good. I would guess about 30g tops for a 12$ cheese plate. Oh ya...that useless salad garnish follows. No forks to eat it with though. So i guess it was there for a touch of colour?! 

All-in-all, this place to me, seemed to be run by a self proclaimed cook (not even chef) and failed miserably. Hidden behind some dix30 style decor. How is it that it has been opened this long???

I gave it two stars because even though the wait in between was long, the service was actually great and the waiters were attentive and apologetic! Would i come back? No way!!!"}
