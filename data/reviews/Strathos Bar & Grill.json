{"text":"We've ordered take out pizza a couple of times and it's always been excellent. A little pricier than typical chain delivery places but they don't skimp on the toppings. The pizzas were loaded!!  The bar itself is a little dark and run down looking, but is an authentic neighborhood bar if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Good pub-food but service depends heavily on the day you go there.  As you would probably not run into this location by chance, we found Stathos Bar & Grill on a day with heavy black ice on Sarcee Trail by googling for a place to take a short rest from driving.  The food was good and prices moderate so we decided to come back again.   On our next visit we took guests from out of town there but the place had changed: the surprise came with the cheque when some items had higher prices than listed on the menu. We asked the waitress and she referred to a sentence at the bottom of the menu: 'prices are subject to change without notice'. We talked to the manager an he explained that it is too expensive for him to print new menus an we would have to accept the bill.  After long time not coming back we decided to test the place again a couple of month ago and were surprised they had new menus. As the food was good we took it off our 'bad' list.  Yesterday we went there again with other guests from out-of-town. To our surprise we had a bad experienced again.   This time it was about the ordered drinks. We asked if they serve 'Alexander Keith Red Amber' and ordered three pints after she confirmed. What she served a couple of minutes later was the 'Pale Ale'. I pointed out that we ordered 'Red Amber': 'This is a pale amber' she answered and went away.   As we had guest I did not complain but this place is definitely off limits from now on."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza and baked pasta in town. Great servers and friendly owners. They have great specials throughout the week"}
{"text":"These guys deserve more love than they've been given. The pizza is great and on special during hockey games so that's when you should go. Trashy and fun with decent food. What's not to love? Oh right, the service."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and I've been going here for years.  The service is friendly, and the food is excellent.  You really can't go wrong no matter what you order. The owner - Terry - takes a lot of pride in whatever comes out of the kitchen.  It's a poor location which is the only reason it's not packed every night in my opinion.  If you're not from Strathcona the easiest way to get there is going down the hill on Bow Trail, stay in the right lane that cuts into Strathcona before you get to Sarcee.  It's right there in the little strip mall."}
{"text":"Strathos is a local bar with local bar quality food.  I was staying at a friend's place in Calgary and after a night of partying we decided it would be easier to go for breakfast than to try to cook, so we hit up the local Strathos. The guys informed me that they have been there a couple of times and enjoy the pizza, but as I didn't want a brunch pizza I opted for the quesadilla. I really enjoyed the quesadilla as it had lots of cheese and beef. My only problem with it would be that I thought it was a little overpriced. The service we received was good and more like what I would expect if I was visiting a family owned restaurant in a small town.  I'd go back to have a drink or an appetizer or pick up pizza (no delivery) but not to entertain people I was hoping to impress."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly environment. The owner knows everyone by name like your local Cheers bar. I'd recommend the pizza. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I'll give this place an average rating since it's your average community watering hole. Tucked away in the weirdest of locations on the cliff of Strathcona deeply entrenched in a residential neighbourhood sits this basic pub, decked out with exactly what you'd expect to see: big wooden bar with a few regulars sitting around it, lots of tv screens airing sports (NHL playoffs right now, and nothing but, cuz this is Canada!), a few pool tables, and lots of seating. We managed to catch the tail end of their daily happy hour and scored some good deals on wine and beer, which was sweet. This would be a decent place to bring the buds, order some Buds and watch the big game."}
{"text":"We moved to stathcona in April 2015, so we've checked out this place a few times. It's pizza is great when the owner makes it, but we've had some not as great. It's a very local drinking hangout, so if your into that it's like a 3 cheers atmosphere, everybody knows your name. It's a shame they aren't on a busier street."}
