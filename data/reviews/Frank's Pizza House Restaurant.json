{"text":"This place is the greatest. Sadly, I cannot frequent it any more due to the non-gluten free menu, but I thought it was worth a write-up, so here goes.

The restaurant is owned and operated by mother and son Maria and Giorgio Taverniti, who are super friendly and helpful if you're looking for suggestions.

The best item on the menu that I've tried is the baked panzerotti ($8). I usually order it with bacon, mushrooms, and pepperoni. It's a gooey, cheesy feast of a meal and it won't cost you more than $10 with tax. You can also choose to get the panzerotti fried instead of baked if you prefer. Either way, it will fill you up!

The pizzas at Frank's are also very good. It's hard to compete with the Neapolitan-style gourmet pizzas served down the street at Marcello's or Pizza e Pazzi, but Frank's makes a tasty pie. 

If you are more inclined to try their pasta, I'd recommend the ravioli or the linguine pescatore. If you order a pasta dish, you also get a serving of garlic bread made from arguably the best bakery in Toronto across the street at Tre Mari Bakery.

Tip: get the bacon on your pizza/panzerotti. They use a special cooking process to bring out the flavour and it tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I called and placed an order for pick up for an XL pizza with garlic bread and pop, it was my first time and as soon as I walked in was greeted at the door by the waitress and the chef himself.

They were quick and double checked that we had the drinks we ordered and now the best part of this was the pizza. It was delicious and not too thick, lots of veggies all over. I would certainly recommend this place if you're in the mood for a good pizza with great customer service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love pizza, love love love it. We love to try new places and make attempts whenever we can to find new gems. We lived in Seoul for a year and had some great pizza there, and may have been spoiled by the ridiculously delicious pizza in Buffalo when I was in school there. We were excited to try this place out due the great reviews but were really let down.

We ordered online on a Friday night. First, it took 15 minutes for them to confirm the order - which is fine, I'll wait a bit for the convenience of not having to call in. The confirmation email said the pizza would be delivered in aprox. 45-60 mins. After 2 HOURS OF WAITING we decided to call in and see what was up. Pizza was finally on it's way. I get that this is a smaller pizza place and not a chain restaurant, but if it's going to be over an hour, you should at least let customers know via a phone call or email. 

The pizza itself did not have enough cheese (which is odd based on some of the reviews saying they were really cheesy pizzas) and the meats were flavourless. The dough that is used is nothing spectacular and my husband wasn't a fan of it at all. 

While we've tried worse pizzas, we probably won't be return customers."}
{"text":"The best pizza delivery in the city.  
Great, simple, unpretentious dinning experience that will not break the bank.  A must try."}
{"text":"This is my third time going to this restaurant. The first two times I enjoyed the food but not the service so much. I find the waitresses a bit stuck up and not friendly as you'd expect from a restaurant.  From the moment our waitress came to the table she had a very stink attitude as if we were more of an annoyance to her having to have to serve us. 

I always order the Greek salad as well as garlic bread or bruschetta to start. The Greek salad was not as creamy as it has been and the bruschetta had too much tomato on it and not enough flavor and because of all the tomatoes the bread was soggy so it didn't taste good.  I informed the waitress of this and she responded, \"Do you want to take some of the tomatoes off?\" I am not sure how that would help being that the bread was already soggy. I told her it was ok because I know it wasn't worth it. 

I guess I should have kept my mouth shut because for the rest of the night not once did they come back to our tables to refill our water or beer as well as check on us to see how things were at our table. I doubt I will be going back to this restaurant again because if it is one thing I hate is being disrespected and ignored at an service establishment for no reason. 

There was a table beside us who came in after us and they were well taken care of. They got their beer and water refilled and the three times they came to look after that table not once did they turn around and ask how things were or offered to refill anything we had. I had to call after her as she was walking away to have her bring us the bill. Every time she came to the other table beside us, her back was to us and she would just walk away without so much as acknowledging our presence. The other table had two people and we were four. 

I was never rude, I just simply informed her something was off about the food as it was not how I know it had been before, nothing to have an attitude about or ignore us most of the night other than when they brought our pizza. The service is very slow but the pizza itself is worth the wait. 

I am sure there are other lovely authentic Italian pizza places in Toronto so I will not be going here again.  

We had about $85 worth of food and we did not give a tip because the service did not deserve any."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Franks Pizza House. They make a really good panzo/calzone, and they deliver to me which is great. I've mainly had pleasant experiences with them, except tonight. The lady over the phone who took my ordered seemed to rush me. She didn't sound friendly at all, and didn't ask if I wanted sauce on the side of my panzo's. As we finished speaking, I began to ask \"so how much is-\" I got hung up on. I think it's bad business practice to not let a customer know how much their food is going to cost. So i had to call back and ask. If it was just a slip up, I wouldn't mind, but because I'd already felt like she didn't want to talk to me it was upsetting.

Can't knock their food though, they make a good calzone. Find the pizza a bit overpriced, marcellos down the street makes a much higher quality pizza, but they don't deliver to me."}
{"text":"Never order from this place. Ever! Ordered a pizza at 8:58pm and had to wait on the phone while the person was S-talking  one of their customers on the other line. Over an hour later, I called to follow up on the status of my order for delivery @ 10:14pm and they said the driver was on route. At 10:17pm, I received a call from the restaurant and they said the driver had \"dropped\" the pizza and I could wait another hour for them to make a new one or cancel my order  and that was said with a fake apology. If I didn't call to follow up, they would have of processed the payment, as I had to give my payment information ahead of time and never deliver my order. Obviously the order was never processed to begin with and they made up the bogus story to buy more time. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Not what I'd call traditional Neapolitan pizza. Mine was dry and felt like a typical delivery pizza for a much higher price tag."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

Ordered a pizza from Franks Pizza House tonight and it was the worst delivery pizza experience I've ever had. I live10 minutes from the restaurant, and can walk there in 25, but somehow my pizza took 1 hour and 45 minutes to arrive. Yes, it was a Friday night. Yes, at peak dinner hours, but when it did arrive, the box was so soggy that the bottom ripped open as I was sitting it down on the counter, and the pizza inside had flopped over on itself and the toppings had slid off during the drive over (which, let me remind you, takes 10 minutes - I promise I don't live in the middle of a rally racing track).

I could have easily walked there, eaten, and left in less than the amount of time it took for this mediocre, cold, soggy pizza to arrive.

I called back to complain, and they said they would send over another pizza \"right away,\" and promised that it would not take another 2 hours like the last one. It arrived about an hour later. Definitely more fresh, but not enough to make up for their ATROCIOUS customer service. Seriously guys, if you mess it up the first time, get my pizza here in half an hour. 45 minutes at the absolute latest. Not one hour. Not two. Did I mention that I live 10 minutes away?

I saw another reviewer on here that had the same problem with a Friday night delivery. Maybe work on your logistics, guys? I'm available, have a PhD in Google Maps, and am happy to be paid in pizza.

Now for the review of the food:
Overall, the pizza was good, but not exceptional in any way. Lots of toppings, although there wasn't much cheese on the pizza at all. I thought that was a pretty crucial part, right? The ingredients were fresh (although the pizza was not, after an hour and a half in a warmer), but I honestly wish I had just ordered Pizzaiolo and gotten a fresh pizza that arrived in 30 minutes, not soaked in sweat, and tasting just as good.

Not any better than your average delivery place.

DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY. Especially on a Friday night. I never will again."}
{"text":"I had a baked calzone with bacon... Delicious!

Very high quality ingredients and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I searched for best pizza in Toronto and this place came up. I went because the location was convenient to where my wife and I were going. We ordered calamari to start. It came with a salad on the side. My wife had the salad and loved it. We thought the calamari was pretty bad. The pizza is what we went for though. I was expecting amazing. It was ok. Pretty cheap with the sausage. Average at best. Not worth the drive downtown. The service was good though. Friendly and quick.gotta give them that."}
{"text":"i went to Frank's for the first time last week at the urging of some friends who live in the area.  My friend suggested I order a calzone, which I did reluctantly.  I never really understood the calzone and have always preferred pizza.  Anyway, it turned out the calzone was fantastic and I ate it all up even though it was probably more than I should have eaten at one time.  The waiter was really nice and you could tell he was truly interested in making sure we had a good experience."}
{"text":"They delivered in time and they were friendly on the phone. Unfortunately the pizza tasted off and the dough was soggy. Both of our pizzas had salami on them and both of them tasted weird.

We called franks after wards to tell them about our issues with the pizza. The lady on the phone was nice but extremely defensive.

Sorry for the bad review. I heard a lot of good things about this place so it might have just been a bad day. Dont think i would ever order in from here again. 


D."}
{"text":"As an Italian and having been to Italy many times, the pasta sauce at Frank's Pizza restaurant is as good as it gets. The service is great and hearing the owners speak Italian in the background and watching them make the food is as cozy as a restaurant can be. The quality is superb and it is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas for pick up.  One was so far overdone as to be nearly unrecognizable.  Unfortunately did not look before grabbing pizzas. Pizza should have been tossed and re-made rather than boxed and pushed out to a customer. Disappointing. No pride in product. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned pizza.  Would like to sit and eat in the dining room next time to get the full experience."}
{"text":"MY FAV FAV spot when craving Italian food...pizza...it's my place and my friends can't get enough!  LOVE YOU GUYS!!!! and the food of course!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here since they opened on St. Clair West in 1995 (maybe?) and we moved onto Harvie Avenue, right around the corner. What can I say besides we have a great relationship that just keeps getting tastier!

We have used Frank's Pizza as catering for family parties at home, and also had parties in house. We recently packed the restaurant full for a memorial for my father. George and Mary always make it a great event. 

My kids are always welcome in the restaurant or at the bar to watch the pizza construction. My partner and I love the easy service and variety of pizzas and entrees on the menu. Luckily we still live within the delivery range even though we moved a bit farther away.

Our family recommends: marguerita pizza, calzone, salads, diavola pizza, quatro stagioni pizza, farfalle con salmone or for take out, the family size pizza is a steal for hungry kids.  Frank's favours big Italian wines as the house vino, montepulciano and a pino grigio my mother always chooses. 

Frank's pizza is a big part of our neighbourhood - let's hope they stick around for another 20 years."}
{"text":"I love a panzerotti with the fire of a thousand burning suns. I put around 4 toppings in mine, mixing it up the three times I have ordered. I always get their caprese salad but I love anchovies so keep in mind they're on there. Their delivery times are pretty good as well. I don't think I ever waited more than 45 mins. They do go on vacation in August but I actually stay loyal as the taste of their food is actually worth it. I keep meaning to try other things since the two regular ones I order are so good but I am a creature of habit...

give it a whirl

high fives."}
{"text":"After getting take out many times, we decided to eat in with a group of five on Saturday night. We were the only table ordering in, however take out orders were flying out the door. Although the food was better, I wouldn't suggest dining in because the food took a long time to come out and it is kind of awkward to eat alone. 

The bar and kitchen are open to the dining room. The decor is basic and the tables are white linen with white paper on top. The service is casual, but I think it was the kitchen that held up the food.

I had the ravioli which tasted homemade. The filling was smooth and creamy. The description says ricotta, but it had a bit of zip like they added goat cheese. It was very good. The sauce is a rich rose. My mother in law said her veal was as good as any she had ever had. And my husbands fried calzone was nice and crispy. Good portions of everything for a good price.

I'm glad this place is in our neighbourhood, but I think they have to work on making their dining room more inviting (I'm debating between 3 and 4 stars). For now, we will continue to get take out."}
{"text":"Want your pizza with a side of rudeness? Perfect, order from Franks. Rude lady on the phone while placing the order (disinterested, unhelpful) delivery guy was even worse. Unfortunately their overly salty toppings and water soaked crust only added to the bad service. Stick with other great pizza houses in Toronto - Terronis, Pizza Libretto, Pizzaiolo even Pizza Pizza, at least there people are friendly."}
{"text":"Overall disappointing. After reading several positive reviews about Frank's my family and I decided to try this place out for lunch. We ordered a baked calzone, a fried calzone and a quattro formaggi pizza. The pizza was, sadly, the only decent part of the experience. 

Despite the restaurant only having 2 other tables seated, our food took about 30 minutes to arrive. The pizza was decent, but had so much feta I couldn't taste anything else. The dipping \"sauce\" that came with the calzones tasted exactly like Heinz tomato soup, but lukewarm and with no salt. The pizza dough had absolutely no flavour, which hurt the already poorly seasoned dishes. 

We ordered 2 cups of black tea but were brought green tea instead. Why? They had \"bought the wrong kind\". Unacceptable for a proper restaurant. I can't imagine it being that hard to pick out the right kind of tea, or at least have some semblance of a selection.  

Condiments such as salt and pepper were not on the table, which was okay, but there was no offer to bring us any, which was a bit disheartening. My mother had to go to the front to ask, which was somewhat annoying. The Italian restaurants we've been to in the past have also had chili oil, and when we inquired about it we were brought a pot of cold, slightly rancid olive oil with some chili flakes sprinkled in. They should have just said they don't have any! There was really no sense of warmth or care in the service. 

I would give one star, but the food was edible and the place was reasonably clean and well furnished. Those, however, are not good enough reasons for us to ever want to return, or suggest the place to others. I don't know why this place has so many high ratings."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 medium pizzas for delivery, one was custom toppings and the other one was a signature pizza - Cacciatora Pizza

The bill came to 47 dollars before tip, so it is a bit pricey compared to chain pizza places, but it was well worth it.

First of all, what Frank's calls a medium is actually a large, so keep that in mind.  Secondly, WOW!  The toppings and crust were completely perfect as was the service I received both from the delivery driver and the person answering the phone.

The toppings were extremely fresh and most of them seemed hand cut.  The crust was firm, yet was soft enough to eat.  The crust had some nice charring on some spots without burning the toppings.

I'm glad we gave them a try, this will be our household's new go-to place for pizza in this area.  Overall, the food and service were both A+"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza like crazy, good pizza. So I took a walk and saw Frank's. It seemed more authentic than the other options. 
I am so happy I stopped in here. I had a calzone and it was soooooo goooood!
You can tell that this is for real Italian pizza. And they know what they're doing. I will definitely go back again for this awesome calzone. 
The only thing is that while my waitress was very nice and friendly, she took a while on things. And they definitely favour their regulars. Some people came in while I was waiting for food and they got a lot more attention than me since the whole family seemed to know them.
But oh well, it was still amazing food. I'm definitely loving it."}
{"text":"I have been eating pizza here for years and it is consistently wonderful!  Whether you're eating in or taking it home, it's pretty great.  I had my engagement party here and It was lovely.  I also ordered their food for a party in the past (I ordered a huge pizza, a tray of chicken cutlets, and a tray of veal cutlets) and the crowd just inhaled it. My personal favourites are their classic pizza (be sure to get extra sauce for dipping!) and their deep fried panzo."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for dinner last weekend. When we arrived, the place was literally empty. What a shame -- the menu is to die for!

The first thing the server asked us is if we were there for the calzones. Judging from all the positive reviews mentioning them, I'm guessing it's the most popular item.

We ordered the ricotta ravioli and the four cheese pizza. The ravioli was delicious, but an incredibly small portion. Only nine pieces in total. The pizza, on the other hand, was huge and tasted better than any other pizza I've tried. Perfect for sharing with someone and thin crust lovers will be pleased.

The decor is beautiful and unique. There is a bar area where you can see the pizza being made. Very friendly staff -- makes me want to open my own ma and pa restaurant."}
{"text":"Quite simply the BEST pizza in the city hands down. The restaurant is a great family place but also a great place to hang out with friends. The atmosphere is friendly and you get a sense of homeliness. The 10'' pizzas are delicious -fresh ingredients, homemade sauce (none of that fake can variety) and crispy goodness. Panzo's are like fried pockets of goodness - it's fried and cheesy- how could you go wrong? 
Beyond the food you will get exemplary service - how many times can you say that you have been to a restaurant and had the chef hand deliver your food to your table or come over personally to check if you enjoyed your meal- not very often. I always get this service when I go in and if the chef does not come over one of his pleasant staff members always ensure the same standards. Stop settling for mediocre pizza- do it right and visits Frank's."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I just don't get all the rave reviews about this place.  We ordered a pizza to go & if I was doing a blind taste test, I would have sworn someone switched our pizza for a McCain's pizza.  The pepperoni was so salty & didn't taste all that great (I ended up picking it off).  The dough as well was more of the cardboard variety.  I really wish I had a different review for Frank's as I was looking forward to trying great pizza in this neighbourhood (as we just moved here).  Perhaps we went on an off day, but I think I'll be opting for a different venue next time we're craving pizza."}
{"text":"Rude, slow service. Waited over an hour and a half for a mediocre pizza and their visa policy is stupid and dissuasive. Won't call again. Long live Marcellos!  

Updating to respond to the \"owner\". The person who answered the phone was rude; I didn't ask her name, I didn't expect to need to follow up.  Not sure how you manage to stand 2 feet away during all operating hours, but it sounds like we have a different idea about what makes good customer service. I specifically asked about how the onions were sliced (makes a difference in flavour, chopped is for cooking) and she confirmed they're sliced. Imagine my surprise to discover a ton of chopped onions. Under the cheese. Fail.

As for why we continued with the order despite the visa policy, I was already thru the order when I was informed of it. I have no problem paying for delivery, but it is silly and illogical to say because delivery is free visa is not. Just charge for delivery if that's the issue. Anyway it was our second time ordering (last time my partner paid cash without the whole song and dance about visa subsidizing delivery). Given how long it took (hour and a half!) and that it was expensive and disappointing to eat, the visa issue won't be a problem for me again."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto about a year and a half ago, from Buffalo, NY.  My standards for pizza are pretty high, as Buffalo has so many great mom and pop pizzerias.  Since moving to Toronto, I have been searching for a decent delivery pizza place.  Tried a few- Pizza del Arte (also on St Clair West), which is okay, Pizzaiolo (meh), Amato (bad experience), etc.  All the places I tried were nothing spectacular, and all I found to cost too much for what they were.  Went to a few more upscale restaurants and ordered hoitie-toitie pizzas that cost a lot, are small, and are probably more like pizza I would get if I were in Italy.  That kind of pizza is fine if I'm feeling rich and want to go out.  But where o where is the neighborhood pizzeria that will give me a generous pie with quality toppings and good crust, that I will still want to eat after it has cooled down and the grease has made the deli paper it rested on translucent the next day?  And I don't want to break my wallet either- after all folks, it's delivery pizza, I should be able to have enough money left over to pick up a six pack to drink with it.  Thank goodness I found Frank's!  Went there on a Sunday evening and was impressed with the interior of the place- clean and nice enough to dine in (unlike a lot of pizzeria's in Buffalo), with a bar no less!  But my husband and I had ordered for pick-up, and while we waited we stood and chatted with the man who was making the pizza right in plain sight behind the counter.  He was friendly and informative with our questions about the menu, as was the older lady who cashed us out.  They gave off a vibe of this being a family business that they were all proud of, and their crisp white chef's uniform and aprons belied that as well.  The pizza man tossed the dough professionally, and when he opened the oven behind him to pull out someone else's pizza, our mouths watered.  At home, we devoured our pie- at last, I have found my go-to pizzeria!  Crust is not too thick but not quite as thin as New York style.  Ingredients were fresh and generous- extra bonus considering that the pizza was still very reasonably priced.  Next time I will request extra sauce (a personal preference- I like my pizzas saucey); I'm sure this place will be happy to accommodate me.  Also will definitely be trying some of their other dishes sometime when we dine in.  Highly recommend- keep these people's business going for a long time so we can continue to enjoy!"}
{"text":"We used to order from here a lot, and then stopped, though I couldn't really remember why.  Decided to order pizza for my husband's birthday, service was nice enough over the phone.  Told him it was my husband's bday in conversation, not because I was expecting anything...but.  Our pizza arrived 1hr 45 mins later.  We are a 10 min drive away.  When I called to inquire about the pizza after 1.5 hours I was told the driver was delayed by traffic from a previous delivery.  When the driver arrived and I expressed my dissatisfaction he looked surprised and said \"well our pizza always takes long, they usually tell you on the phone\".  I said \"no one told me it was going to be over an hour (FOR PIZZA) because if they did I wouldn't have ordered - we have a 3 year old that needs to go to bed before the pizza even arrived\".  So they lied when they told me the delay was due to traffic.  I told the driver I was very disappointed, and hoped that they would call me to resolve this or at least offer some kind of refund / compensation.  Nothing.

So I remembered why I don't order from Franks anymore.  Because their delivery time is way too long, the pizza arrives cold and they don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"Just got a pizza from here for the first time. My boyfriend tony picked it up, I wanted to try a new place and read about them in a TOBlog pizza review. Very happy I did, was amazing and from what I hear Giorgio is an amazing guy so amazing pizza n customer service, what more do u want!??"}
{"text":"Ordered off Uber. Tiny not special at all pizza for over $20. Can't taste any sausage. Massive rip off. tasted like a slightly better than frozen pizza. Fuck this shit. Never again."}
{"text":"This place looks pretty new.  We arrived just after 12, and for the next 75 minutes, we were the only customers.

The 10\" pizzas - 1 plain cheese and 1 Vegetariana (broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms and artichoke hearts) - were thin crust, and pretty average.

The server was the co-owner, I believe.  Perhaps the son from the mother/son owner tandem.  He was very friendly and helpful.  We were there because of a Groupon purchase, but I forgot the paper \"coupon\".  He graciously checked his list and honoured the Groupon.

It seemed a tad pricey for lunch.  The two pizzas and one Brio was 30 bucks. 

They had a dessert menu with 3 items, tiramisu, another cake and tartufo.  The two cakes were shipped from Italy.  We didn't have anything, but how good could a $6 piece of cake be that has made the trip from Italy?  What, no local Italian bakers good enough?

They have expresso-based drinks, but no \"Canadian coffee\".

To sum up, if you're in the area, this place is worth a try, just don't make a special trip.

(Ooops, just checked their web site...they've been open since 1992.)"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, bad service.
Every time I call, the rude woman who answers tries to talk me out of ordering. \"It's going to take over an hour. Are you sure?\"
I used to deal with the attitude and the long delivery times, but the driver has also been rude and sarcastic about delivery on several occasions. I finally decided it was enough. I'm not dealing with another grumpy, late delivery.
They don't like delivering, so do them a favour and order from someone else."}
{"text":"What a great lunch experience. I found Frank's Pizza House from a recent BlogTO review which touted it as the #1 calzone in Toronto.

Although it's rare that I'll give five stars after one experience, this place deserves it.

My panzerotti was delicious! (the mystery has been dispelled thanks to Giorgio, a panzerotti is fried, a calzone is baked). I opted for the classic pepperoni and cheese only with tomato sauce on the side. A purist selection, as it were. Although it was deep fried, it was not at all greasy. There was an amazing amount of quality cheese inside (you can tell it was good by it's taste, which was noticeable). You can also tell that the tomato sauce must be made from scratch, very tomato-y). I just had to buy another to take home for wifey to try.

The environment is superbly clean and the staff/owners were kind, hospitable and perfectly conversational.

An overall pleasant experience, I'll be back and I will definitely order for delivery (through just-eat).

Visit Frank's. You'll see."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza. It took over an hour which I understand can happen. When it got here it was cold and clearly wasn't fresh. When I called to let them know they responded by telling me that's it's cold outside. Brutal."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I ordered 2 calzones for pick up. We asked to fry instead of baked. 3 toppings each with a side of their in house sauce. Took 45 min to make. Total amount around $30. 

I've had better elsewhere for a fraction of the price. Although the dough is delicious, I expected the calzone to be more crunchy instead of soft. Maybe we'll come back to try their pizza instead."}
{"text":"Tried the Calzones for takeout last night for the first time.

Definitely enjoyed the generous amount of sauce, the dough was incredible.  One thing to note, not sure what kind of Pepperoni used, but it was very strange from what we are used to.  I prefer the think sliced, that was more like a deli meat sausage or something like that, I wouldn't order this topping again, would try something else.  

Excited to try the pizza next time, as we could definitely tell the Calzone was fresh made, the cheese, bacon and mushrooms were awesome!  So used to domino's or something like that, it was great to have a fresh, home made alternative!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, Frank's pizza was pretty good for pizza delivery.  Way better than pizza pizza.  But a few things brought my rating of Frank's down. 

First of all, tho' I love a cheesy pizza, these just had too much.  Each slice felt like it could be used for weight-lifting (which we would need after indulging in such gooey pizza!).  It made for a very salty experience.  My advice: go for un-salty topping at this place (rather than, say, olives) and you'll have a better experience.  Also, the toppings themselves were just ok.  We decided to splurge and ordered some rapini (a \"gourmet topping\" according to Frank's), but it was overcooked and stringy, rather than fresh with the slightly bitter bite that makes rapini so good.

Most of all, though, it was just too darn pricey.  For two extra large pizzas and two salads, we paid $77.  Not bad for feeding 7 people, but still.  For pizza?

Vegetarian score: 8/10.  Totally average for a pizza place with a few nice extra veggie-friendly choices."}
{"text":"Truly the best Calzone/Panzarotto place in the entire city. Nowhere else can even hold a candle to Frank's.  I am not just saying that either. I have traveled far and wide (the GTA, that is) always looking out for new places to try one of my favourite Napolitano dishes.

Frank's is always consistent with the quality of ingredients, reliability of service and friendly customer interaction. I have both eaten in and ordered from them more times than I can count, and I cannot think of any reason why I would stop patronizing them!"}
{"text":"I have had three issues with delivery at this place. First time they made a mistake not that big of a deal second time they offered a replacement pizza third time nothing but attitude from Mary the manager all she kept on saying was that they are busy and made mistakes. I understand being busy but making a mistake on toppings three time I think is not understandable. Yes they offered a two free toppings on the next pizza. When I said I would not order again she just replied that we would experience the same thing somewhere else. Not happy at all not worth waiting an hour for delivery and getting wrong pizza."}
{"text":"So happy I finally moved somewhere that they will deliver to. The calzones are so good! The sauce is the best I've ever had. I wish my calzone would go on forever! The caesar salad was amazing as well. Only thing I didn't like was the minestrone soup. It was really terrible. Tasted too much like dried veggies and beans. So much so that even the broth tasted like a dried bean. But nobody orders from here to have soup. Let's be reasonable."}
{"text":"The negative reviews are crazy this pizza is amazing!! I ordered the basic pizza (pepperoni, green peppers and mushrooms), absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, flavour unlike any of the chains, everything real and fresh, no fake cheese, and total came to 19$ before tip for a size medium (which is closer to a large). There was a bit of a mixup when I called over delivery zones but they delivered anyways despite being way out of their way, pizza was hot, fresh and delicious. Owner was really nice and personable, great customer service, Im going to use UberEats app next time so as to not incovenience their driver. Thanks for the great pizza Frank's!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great!!!!  Met up with some friends for a couple of pizza's and some pints after work..  service was great, the pizza was fresh and tasty and their sauce is fantastic!!!  It's not fancy, they have paper overtop the linen table cloths to catch the sauce that flies off your fork when you eat the spaghetti .. I have never seen in super busy, but I know a lot of people that take out... and the place is clean."}
{"text":"This place is less than average. I've eaten here twice the first time I dined in and although the food was moderately good the service was terrible! When we came in we were the only table and it still took the server 5 minutes to bring us menus and then took forever taking our order. A table came in shortly after we did and also waited a long time for service. 
The second time was tonight and not wanting to be subjected to the bad service of dining in we decided to  get take out as we were aware of the insanely long wait time for delivery. My friend ordered the ravioli which on their take out flyer says comes stuffed with cheese. When we got it home it was stuffed with meat and my friend is a vegetarian. I ate the ravioli instead and it was not even good. It's basically frozen ravioli I could buy at the grocery store. Not a good experience and I will not be returning. Do your self a favour and steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. In the summer they roast the red peppers on a bbq in the back alley and they are delectable on a pizza. Have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Got delivery... everything was great! Also got a few doughs so I can make some at home. They were very polite and accommodating when I asked them questions about making my own pizza... they gave detailed instructions... my pizza turned out great"}
{"text":"I have to reply to the owner's response to my post.
Let me ask you, when you go to a restaurant and order a Caesar salad do you ask what ingredients are in it, or do you expect it will be property prepared. I appreciate your passion for your restaurant but for me it didn't show in the food."}
{"text":"I ordered in tonight, and experienced a short lived disappointment, upon seeing the size of the pizza. This disappointment ended when I bit into the delicious pizza. I Can definitely see why it is Toronto's best pizza. For Tonights order I  got the 10\" Toronto pizza,It was amazing. The only problem I had being   the size!!, it just doesn't measure up to the price. With other ma and pa pizza shops beating them by a dollar or more.  I will definitely order from here again, but not the pizza. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying  that the pizza wasn't amazing, but  The calzone is way bigger and a better bang for your buck even if you where to get all the toppings the pizza I ordered came with (3).And other words of advice. Don't order through uber eats,using fFranks delivery service is free as long as you pay cash."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a few times, but this will be the last. The service over the telephone is beyond rude! Also waiting for delivery for over 1 1/2 hours is ridiculous. My over priced salad didn't even come with dressing. The pizza wasn't even cut properly with mammoth sized slices. 
The \"manager\" hung up on me and said he'd review me back. So I've included pictures to save you your time, hunger and money. 

Toronto is full of great Italian restaurants. I won't be ordering here again!"}
{"text":"I just went to try the Panzarotti  they are pretty much famous for, and I can see why.  Everything tasted very fresh.  Amazing crust, not greasy at all.  Delicious dipping sauce, for sure home made! BEST panzo you will ever have, guaranteed.  Friendly staff, a true family business that makes you feel welcomed as soon as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Awesome. Walk in deal. Great pizza.  Always friendly.  I'm surprised by some of the comments on here.  I live in the neighborhood and order all the time."}
{"text":"The panzos here are the REAL DEAL!! I am so happy to have found you! If I remember, I ask for it 'extra crispy'...  because, why not? SO delicious, just you remember them from Panzerotto & Pizza, except much better because you can customize fillings, they are made fresh to order, and they just seem better. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Since moving into the area we have gotten take-out from here numerous times. We have usually had the calzones or the pizza. Both are delicious and cooked perfectly. Toppings are fresh and plenty to choose from. 
Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a classic pizza joint at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I had been there yesterday's night and was left disappointed. 
A guy who was making pizzas was very nice and welcoming and told me that I could have a seat. But the wait staff didn't seem to pay much attention to me throughout the whole time. I had to literally catch a girl with glasses to tell her that I was ready to order. Then apparently she messed up my order as I clearly ordered a deep fried calzone but received a baked one instead. Not to mention that I was waiting on it for an hour or so. Also, the girl never checked on me if everything was OK, though she checked on other table with a bunch of people who she was apparently familiar with. Naturally, I didn't feel like tipping her as she had definitely not deserved a penny.
That was quite a disappointing experience, especially after reading many positive reviews. Even though the food was pretty good, unfortunately I am reluctant to ever come back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Meh, a bit disappointing considering they did not get my order right and then tried to say it was my fault.. No I did not ask for mushrooms nor would I never in this lifetime ever use the word mushroom, I hate those things, ugh.

I am always up for trying a new pizza joint, I found this place searching for panzerotti right here on Yelp and this was one of the few places that showed up.

The panzerotti after it was made right, was okay.  As you all should know a panzerotti is deep fried and this thing was full on greasy but I won't complain about that because I did order it knowing that it in deep fried. 

There is a upside to this place, which I found out from the owner who is a very friendly man. He is one of the few left who actually use REAL cheese! Everywhere else like Pizza Pizza, Pizzaville, Pizza Nova etc all use WHEY PROTEIN! isn't that interesting? I guess that explains why the cheese always looks so plastic and perfect white ..

Not only does he use real cheese, but he uses an amazing amount of cheese, I would come back, because it wasn't bad, just a little out of the area and hopefully my order comes out right next time."}
{"text":"No you won't see frank, but you will see his nephew George.  This is still a family run business, and it feels like it.

Atmosphere - your basic pizza joint classed up a bit.  It not too fancy, and not too plain.  Its a nice quiet place, a little on the small side, but comfortable. Paper menus?  Yes, but I'd take that over a place with leather bound menus that charge me twice the price and turn up their nose at me when i don't buy a $60+ wine.

Service - Excellent.  It wasn't that busy, but it was an hour before closing. (we were the only customers, except for two guys waiting for take out). We were invited to split two dishes so we could try more of the menu, and they even welcomed our quirky requests. I wonder how this place is when its busy (apparently on friday and saturday - just like every other resto).

Pizza - hot, fresh, thin.  Had the diavolo.  The hot peppers are actually hot!

Panzerotti - this was the star of the show.  Wow!  It kind of like the Panzerottis at \"Panzerotto Pizza\", but its made by someone that cares how it tastes like. The biggest difference was that the panzo is NOT soggy.  How you ask? They leave most of the sauce out, and this results in deep fried goodness that does not spill all over the place. extra sauce is provided on the side if needed.

Dessert - i didn't get a chance as i was stuffed to the gills.  But they have tartufo {only in the summer] and tiramisu.  The tiramisu IS brought over from Italy, and is apparently a big hit (especially for delivery). The tiramisu does not have any alcohol in it for those people that don't appreciate the flavour [me!!].  I will definately give it a try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Good old floppy thin crust pizza, one of the better I've had for delivery.  Nothing fancy just good old pizza"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever.

We ordered based on a Blog TO list and were sadly very disappointed.  

It took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive and when it did it was over cooked and rock hard.  This was not the worst part.  It literally had no taste!!! Even the sausage tasted like nothing. I cut up hot dog would have been better...We both agreed there are far superior frozen pizzas on the market than Frank's.  

We like to support independent businesses but I'd definitely recommend a chain over this place.  

Oh and the box had an add for a personal injury law firm on it but I digress..."}
{"text":"Two more visits and quality is always great.  The diavola and pastore zas are delicious."}
{"text":"You make a good pizza but, an extra $2.50 to use credit and no debit available for delivery? C'mon....it's 2017 and technology is available. You're good, but not THAT good.

One customer lost."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about the pizza, a bit of a disappointment. Cozy little restaurant though."}
{"text":"When our family wants calzones, this is where we order from with a side of sauce. We've learned to order early before they get too busy. Average wait time for delivery is an hour which is normal. Keep in mind on Friday or Saturday nights they're busy and it will take longer to deliver."}
{"text":"Found in Corsa Italia, this place prides itself on being known for its calzones. I mean, it has been on the 'best of' lists for basically everywhere. So I had to try it. 

When I went to visit, our waitress tells us that typically the calzones ($8) are baked or fried. We have ours baked and I try mine with caramelized onions, bacon, mushroom and extra cheese. My pal gets goat cheese, roasted red pepper and sausage. 

The dough is nice and thin, which means you can eat with your hands or a fork and knife. The only thing I would say I noticed was that the calzones (IMO) needed more filling. Perhaps this is a personal preference? The marinara sauce with the calzone (an extra charge) is pretty heavenly. Perfect for dipping.

I also ordered a caesar salad (on the side) and paired with the calzone, it was SO MUCH FOOD.  Also, there was a sign on the door saying they deliver via JustEat so this is the best news I've heard all week.  If you're a calzone/panzo fan like I am, you must make the trip out to Frank's."}
{"text":"Pretty good calzones. Good value for delivery. More like 3.5 stars.
The bad: Caramelized onions taste pickled, chorizo not that great."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Fresh topping which was nice. Customer service was not very good. They messed up our pizza order and did not really seem to care about correcting it. Not sure that o would recommend this place."}
{"text":"best pizza i've had in a city that clearly isn't renown for its pies. haven't eaten in-house but the food we had delivered was consistently great, especially when compared to the alternatives in the area. the employees must have been a bit sketched out after my wife & i ordered 3 nights in a row following our first pleasant experience. recommended."}
{"text":"Real rapini. Homemade sauce. The best pizza on St Clair Avenue West is worth the interminable wait.

Because really.  Truly.  They are *that* slow."}
{"text":"Love this place, order from here all the time. Great pizza, great crust, super friendly ordering process. 

I've been in the restaurant before, pretty nice, family spot."}
{"text":"Nice place we had the matrimoni pasta and the peoeroni and mashroom pizza.
My friend loved the pasta for me was just ok but i really liked the pizza.
Good place to get toogether. We shared
Everything and still took half of the pizza home
Wiatress is really nice"}
{"text":"I like the pizza but after several deliveries which always take forever, I can't be bothered to deal with this shady operation any longer. $2.50 extra if you want to pay via credit card? What a joke. They ain't too friendly on the phone either.

What makes things even shadier is if you order via Uber, your only option is to select a 10\" miniature pizza. They changed the menu which basically gauges the customer. Uber delivery ain't reliable either and I have received stone cold pizza almost every time.

It's a shame ownership's decisions suck cause they make solid pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza here tonight. It's unfortunate I can't seem to find any quality pizza delivery in Toronto. After asking for it to be made well done, it was hardly cooked and even picking it up all toppings fell off immediately. The cheese was not good and there was hardly any tomato sauce. The free delivery is nice but for the price I might as well order something like pizza nova."}
{"text":"I love mom and pop restaurants so when i needed to grab dinner in this area, a quick read of my fellow yelpers helped me to decide on this place.  It's a fairly small restaurant but there was a good selection of pizza, pasta and calzones.  I got the  diavolo pizza (sausage and hot peppers) and it was fantastic.  Thin and crispy bottom, hot peppers with kick and a nice fresh, homemade sauce.  My friend got a calzone and though it was good, it did get a bit soggy in the middle (guess that's why  you should get the fried version!)  It was still tasty and the separate sauce was a good touch.  We devoured my pizza and at $12.50, how could you NOT go back!
Definitely planning another trip to try out the pastas!"}
{"text":"best calzones in toronto :)"}
