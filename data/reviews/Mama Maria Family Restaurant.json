{"text":"Wonderful place to dine and have a great time. There breakfast is A1 and so delicious. With so many options, I just keep going back. The staff is very polite and service all your needs. There burgers, Italian food and fish dinners are amazing! They also have a all you can eat salad and soup bar."}
{"text":"Went for their Friday night Fish fry specials during lent.  Lake Erie Perch was excellent.  I requested rice for my potato which was specially made and yummy.  Nice salad bar.  I went elsewhere real close by for a fish fry the week before that was nowhere near as good.  Give them a try here!"}
{"text":"Good food,economical compared to Bob Evans. Enjoyable experience. Great service. Family atmosphere.  Looks like good values on the menu"}
{"text":"Will stick to the breakfast menu. We ordered the onion rings as a appetizer, 12 onion rings with a marinara sauce. We received a onion blob no sauce NO FLAVOR not crispy. Tuna melt was ok had hard boiled eggs in it  not a fan of that. Husbands burger was good but after the onion rings we we just disappointed. Other times we had breakfast and that's what we will stick with. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast prices and the owner is so nice. I like the meat lovers omelette and the glazed pork chops for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered meatloaf / mashed potatoes literally was a hamburger with gravy on it and watery instant potatoes. My mixed grill with no starch and no onions turned into double rice and extra onions. The kabab meat was good, but no effort to fix the screw up or address my onion allergy."}
{"text":"Used to go there twice a week, not any more.  Had to leave without being served after waiting 20 minutes with servers looking at the menu's on our table.  I understand your busy, but to ignore the menu's and apologizing to every customer is ridiculous.  We were the fourth group to walk out."}
