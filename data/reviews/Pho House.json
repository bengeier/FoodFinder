{"text":"good pho for the west-end. very clean, very unusual for asian places, especally vietnamese restaurants. however, usually nice asian restaurants aren't authentic but this place is run by true viets.   don't get their thai mango salad though, it REALLY sucks. it is DRENCHED in fish sauce or whatever."}
{"text":"If you are looking for nice and clean pho house, this is the place. The taste is good as well as their service. My parents in law told me that their friends found this place very clean and nice as well. If you go other pho places, you will see the oily broth which makes you feel, ewwww..... but this place has very good quality pho."}
{"text":"The wonton soup is seriously the best I've ever had. It is literally perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. They also have spring rolls that have some sort of crunchy stuff around the outside.. these are so good and way better then their regular spring rolls. The other things on the menu that I have tried like the pad thai are good but not on the same level of goodness as that soup."}
{"text":"this place was fine.  Friendly enough; you get a sheet with all possible selections for you to enter your order - including drinks.   Not sure if this place is licensed as I didn't see any alcohol on the order sheet.   Had the deep fried spring rolls - which were really good also a Pad Thai - which was fine but chicken felt it had been overcooked or low quality chicken.  Similar scenario with one of the Curry Chicken Noodles (item 260 I think) - chicken seemed overcooked or low quality.  Prices are very reasonable and they do a thriving takeout business.  Bathrooms were fine."}
{"text":"The pho is delicious and reminds me of the pho served at Da Vang and Pho Thanh.  Divey and cheap this is my new go to vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"I had their Beef pho soup noodle and house spring roll. Taste was average, but you can tell the bean spouts were fresh they had the right colour and crunch.    The decor and atmosphere is modern, cost was comparable to other Pho noodle places."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and can't really find another place in the east end that tops it! I went some place else once and regretted it. Food is good, a few good veggie options, staff are sooooo friendly!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.Pho addicts like me are always looking for a new place to satisfy the crave. I've been to most all the Vietnamese restaurants in metro Phoenix,and I'd say that Pho House is top five,maybe even top three when it comes to pho.It's all in the broth. The broth is very flavorful and well-balanced.It tastes to me somewhat sweet and oniony like Maxim,but a little beefier and saltier like Da Vang.It's like a mixture of those two.You know a great broth when you get to the bottom of the bowl,after all the flavors have coalesced,and you're slurping up the last of it,and it's just about the best taste in the world!A true pho addict will know what I'm talking about.Pho House passed this test with flying colors.Top it off with the fact that Pho House is dirt cheap,like Da Vang or Pho Thanh.The bowl of Pho Tai Bo Vien was $5.50,and the bowl is almost extra-large size at other places.No skimping on noodles either,and the beef was thin-sliced,tender,and plentiful.Basil and bean sprouts were fresh.The only thing preventing a 5-star rating was that the goi cuon (spring rolls) were good, not great.The peanut sauce was all good,and they don't skimp on the shrimp,but I'd prefer the more-flavorful grilled pork (think Khai Hoan,Little Saigon or Anise Cafe), rather than the bland poached pork that they use.I'd also prefer less lettuce and more rice noodles.That being said,I hope my fellow Yelpers will check out and hopefully support this place.It's spartan but clean,and the menu is less extensive than some others in town,Turns out these folks that run Pho House are from Houston,a city with a much larger Vietnamese community than Phoenix.They have a restaurant there too,and they obviously know how to make a tasty bowl of pho.I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A small family run restaurant that never fails to deliver. I love, love Pho and every time I am in the neighborhood, I have to pay my visit. The pho's here are phenomenal and the prices are low too. I give it a 2 thumbs up. Try it!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. I ordered Pho rare beef and enjoyed it a lot. If you plan to order pho order small or mideim. Large is too big. I like this place better than Green Mango.  Note that they don't take Amex."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Pho House.  Unfortunately, I am not planning on coming back for pho here again.  The pho broth was too salty.  I'd be interested in giving this restaurant another chance with some of their dishes, particularly their thai curries, albeit their menu is more expensive than other pho/asian restaurants.   My boyfriend and I both had pho soup, and shared a sizzling plate for dinner (around 7 pm on Tuesday night).   We spent about $31 for a small pho soup ($6) , a medium pho ($7), and beef sizzling plate ($14.50).  The location is on a plaza along with Shoppers and Starbucks.  The restaurant itself looks nice and \"upscale\" relative to other pho restaurants.  Usually, this is not a good sign for me - as they probably spend a considerable amount on the aesthetic, than their food - and I was right. The first disappointment for me was that they do not serve tea upon sitting you. Even more disappointing since their menu are more expensive than several other pho restaurants (that serve tea).  Food was also poor.  The pho broth was too salty for me.  My boyfriend who generally prefers well--salted food even agreed.   The side plate of pho condiments also lack lemongrass (which I love, and other pho restaurants also serve).   They also do not serve you the small saucer for the hoisin sauce and siracha, you'd have to ask them for it.  The sizzling plate was mediocre.  Sadly, the service did not make up for the food."}
{"text":"I've never provided a review ever but felt compelled to do so after reading some of the comments.  So here goes my review debut.    I've been waiting for a pho shop to open close to the Biltmore (24th St. & Camelback) which is where my office and home are located.  I'm Vietnamese and all I really care about when it comes to pho is the quality of the broth and freshness of the ingredients:  Pho House delivers on that product pho sure!!  And nothing beats a bowl of pho for less than $6 (sorry, for folks who complain that $6 is expensive probably need to stick with Taco Bell).  I've only been there a handful of times since learning of their opening through a mail advertisement, so I'm not too familiar with the owners or employees (as I am with the folks at Da Vang and Pho Thanh).  The owners/staff are seemingly more quiet and not as \"outgoing\" as the other places but they have always been responsive to my table needs and the needs of customers when I've been there.  Also, I'm not sure the standard to which folks measure cleanliness but Pho House is no different than most other local places my family have dined at including DV's and PT.  And yes, it is very common for Vietnamese restaurants to be closed on Tuesday (certain small family-owned businesses need a day off too, just happens not to be Sundays like most); certainly nothing to be critical of.    I definitely recommend Pho House for a delicious hot bowl of tasty soup."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from southern CA where we have lots of Vietnamese immigrants that are doing Pho right. Since our move to AZ last year, we have found only two places that we love for Pho. This is one of them. The staff doesn't speak much English, but enough to get our orders correct and become familiar with customers. We recently had a cousin come from out of town and we were cutting it close to closing hours. We called in our order and when we arrived, so did our soup! The broth is really tasty, the meat is of better quality than most places. They don't skimp on the basil, limes, peppers or whatever you want. The egg rolls are a delight. The Thai tea, however, not suggested for purchase at this establishment. It tastes like cotton candy :-p  I never judge a restaurant on service, it should always be an aside unless you are paying for that service. This place has good services, so it's just like getting extra sprinkles on your sundae. They are open until nine pm. I think the information is posted as 8 pm.   If you like Pho, take a chance with the Mexican neighborhood, and go check it out. Your car and guest will be fine, not to mention satisfied."}
{"text":"PHOO HOUSEEEE.They have reached that constant excellence and they keep getting better each time....Crispy clean, good service and great food.The first couple of months their service was not as good as today but food has always been greaattt. They are never rude no matter how picky or annoying you are as a customer and again you can tell if a place is good or not by how busy it gets.It is always a pho house party at this place !!"}
{"text":"The pho here is amazing. I would say it is the best in the east end. The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, but $7 for a big bowl of delicious pho tai and you can't complain about d√©cor. Fast service and simply delicious food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awkward looking and near my work. The inside is painted blue and white. Very strange and not a good ambiance. Food is good though. Not sure I will be going back. The area is super shady."}
{"text":"Have been sick with the worst flu in decades for about 2-3 weeks now and found this place while craving something spicy and brothy. Decided to check it out with my husband and a friend of ours and we asked the waiter for help ordering as it was our first time trying pho. The service was amazing and we felt very welcome. After going hungry for days due to lack of appetite and nausea it was so good to be pounding back not just 3 huge servings of pho but some rice and thai curry dishes also! Absolutely love this place! If it tastes this amazing while I'm sick and cranky I can only imagine how great it is when healthy! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Have had the Pho here many many times, the regular beef as well as the spicy broth, very homey-feeling and delicious.   I have also had several other dishes including the green & red thai curries, singapore noodles, sizzling beef satay & pad thai. They were all good, with decent portion sizes and were very flavourful.  The staff there are fantastic, very hard working. Service is always fast and they always let you stay and talk with your company without rushing you out."}
{"text":"I work around the area ..this is my go to spot for lunch ...the staff is great...good food with excellent prices ...you can't go wrong with pho house"}
{"text":"The restaurant we originally wanted to go to was closed, so we found a nearby joint.  Having been to Vietnam 3 times, I am quite picky with Vietnamese restaurants.  This place had the BEST Bun Rieu (Crab Soup with Vermicelli) that I've tried in a restaurant and reminded me of the one I had in the streets of Saigon.  Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least once maybe twice a week.  The pho broth is just perfect and not as salty as you find at Pho Pasteur or the Cow Heads place on Spadina (the name escapes me right now). I know this is a personal preference, but I find their clear and un-salty broth to be some of the best I've had.  The meat is decent, but as others says the rare beef cooks very quickly (so eat it up quick!).  Tendon and Tripe are also tasty options.  Service is efficient and friendly, and quality is consistent.    The go to Pho Place downtown in my books.  They'd get five stars if they dropped an additional piece of beef/tripe/tendon in there (though this is a minor quibble... my tripe intake is probably already too high)."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Love their crispy spring rolls and their rare beef Pho soup. I can easily finish a small, but if you're really hungry go for a medium. Take out is easy and ready within 15 minutes usually. Friendly staff and consistently good - I've never had something I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Atendimento amig√°vel, r√°pido e atencioso. A comida n√£o parece ter nada especial para ser destacado, s√£o ensopados tradicionais da culin√°ria vietnamita servidos de forma honesta."}
{"text":"This place in East Chinatown is formerly known as Pho 88. I came here with sarah l. during our series of non-sexual dates[1] and I am declaring Pho House my front-runner for Pho-bruary in Toronto.[2]   The Pho-ndamentals Pho Tai Gan (rare beef and beef tendon); large = $6.50 Broth: so far, my favorite broth in the (416); rich and hearty with fatty pools of delicious oil and nicely spiced Beef: thicker, more flavorful slices of beef Tendon: thick slices but they are not as tender as at Pho Pasteur Noodles: dried, i.e., not fresh noodles but steeped just right in the tasty broth but they did need some swishing around to separate the clumps Garnishes: the mung bean sprouts and basil were fresh; they did not include saw leaf but brought it out upon request (I think sarah l. diminished my Asian cred!)  Service: Friendly and efficient; the waitresses wear hairnets so no hair in your soup, Neil T! The good-looking dude (probably the owner's son) speaks perfect English and is ever so easy on the eyes...swoon...  Other: They were actually playing decent music on our visit and the fresh iced lemonade ($2.00) was tart and refreshing.  Almost perfect but I'm deducting points for the sub-par tendon and lack of fresh noodles. 4 and 1/4 stars =================== [1] Eat your heart out Tara G!

{"text":"I eat here pretty much every single time I am in Toronto. The Pho is always consistently good as is the service. The Vermicelli noodle dishes are also a home run. Everything is super cheap. The value here is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I've been to this place two weeks in a row. I've ordered the 101 large each time and it did not disappoint. I typically ask to have the beef on the side and for thin noodles. That is my preference and they cater everytime.  However looking back, i would opt for 102 since it is $0.50 less and does not come with the hum drum mundane tastless meatball halves - only 3 half pieces might I add. The thin slices of raw beef I would say is ok, not the best i've ever had.  Notwitstanding, everything was so good nonetheless that I ate everything and even drank all the soup. I find it always tastes better with a little bit of hot sauce that you squeeze out of the containers and all the condiments that it comes with - bean sprouts, basil, hot pepper, and the lime. Mind you I am always coming from a 10-15km run so i'm famished when i reach this restaurant.  We also ordered the deep fried spring rolls. They come piping hot served with authentic spicy fish sauce and were very tasty & crisp.  The ambiance leaves much to be desired as it is a simple plain decor akin that of every other asian cheap eat restaurants.  There's nothing particular about it other than two fans (one ceiling fan and the other is a stand up fan at the back) and one tv.  The damage was $20 for two people including tax and tip.  The service was fast & friendly, and for some reason you have to go to the back cashier to pay the bill.    Although I didn't try it, they do have the usual assortment of fruit juices and other asian-like beverages to select from."}
{"text":"I only have one thing when I visit the Pho House, and that's their Sizzling Fish dish. Even though I always consider ordering something else, I always go back to it because it JUST TASTES SO GOOD! It's hot, spicy, flavourful - delicious!   The service is always excellent. My only complaint is that it's really cold in the restaurant in the wintertime - whoever designed the layout did them a disservice because every time the door opens, a gust of cold air travels down the entire length of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Pho House is my go to place when I'm craving a bowl of hot soup. Their flavours are excellent and traditional and the price point definitely can't  be beat.   The owners and wait staff are always friendly and explain anything on the menu of you have questions or are unsure. They make you feel at home and are always sure to bring you some hot tea in those cold days or a big glass of iced green tea when it's hot out.   I've been going here regularly for 3 years and wouldn't go anywhere else when anyone suggests Pho.   Items not to miss are the crab rangoon (25), beef satay pho(124), shrimp spring rolls(6) and the spicy mango salad(sl1)"}
{"text":"Out of all the pho places I went to, this pho place is way overpriced for what you get. The only good thing about this pho place compared to all the other ones is that its extremely clean."}
{"text":"The food is not the best but very good, the service is good unless they are very busy then they fall behind a little. Prices are reasonable lots of parking."}
{"text":"warning!!! terrible service and below average food. The servers were rude trying to rush you to leave when they don't close for another 45 minutes. Couldn't eat the (bad) food and take my time. never go here."}
{"text":"I almost never give bad reviews. Ordered the XL pho with rare beef & brisket (I never finish an XL size, I just order it for the extra meat). Got rare pieces the were super dry well done & only 2 small pieces of brisket. Overall soup tasted mediocre,and service was a bit rude.   Definitely I won't comeback  Do yourself a favor & look for a better pho restaurant.. There are so many decent ones in town  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town.   Tai Chin (117) is fantastic!  They also have a great sweet and sour soup.  We go here often and have never been disappointed (except we find the pho broth better later in the day -- maybe just coincidental).  Our other favourite is one of their Bun dishes (can't remember the full name - cold noodles, grilled chicken and beef, vegetables and peanuts with sauce). It's delicious.  And the service there is excellent. Everyone is so kind.  I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Don't let the yeasayers fool you; the pho here is just not good.  Pho restaurants are a dime a dozen in Toronto, so if a place serves an average bowl of pho, there is really no reason to choose it over the many others out there. Pho House is the perfect example.  The broth, which is supposed to be the centrepiece of any good bowl of pho, is flavourless. The aroma is decent but underwhelming. The broth has little to none of the beefy umami notes that makes proper pho so mouthwatering. Also it needs a big boost of spices such as cinnamon.  On the plus side, the cuts of steak are lean as they should be and the rice noodles are also fine. Although since the broth has so little flavour, when you cram a chopstickful of noodles in your mouth it tastes like you're eating noodles dripping with plain water.  The tripe is also fine but I wish it was cut more thinly; there were several unattractive hunks of it floating in my bowl.  Overall, this is just NOT a bowl of pho made with LOVE.  I've also had the spring rolls which were small and mushy on the inside. I assume they come in frozen.  In terms of the service, I've never had a problem. The staff seem young and inexperienced, but not unhelpful. The prices are about a dollar too high per item for what you're getting. Oh, and did I mention, they CHARGE for tea? WHO DOES THAT?!  The only time I come here is when I'm absolutely desperate for pho and am tired or sick, since it's the closest pho restaurant to where I live. Maybe one of the reasons people are rating it so highly is because there is nothing else to compare it with in the Etobicoke area.  If you ask me, it's worth the trek to a place like Pho Linh or Pho Pasteur for a really satisfying bowl of Vietnam's national dish.  I have also tried the vegetable rice noodle soup which served up a bland broth with RAW vegetables. The broth was not nearly hot enough to cook the veggies, resulting in a very sad bowl of soup indeed.   The one saving grace? The Thai style seafood soup with rice noodles is really nice."}
{"text":"The management has changed and not for the better. Came here for lunch and there are only 4 tables, the rest of the place was empty. They had three people working the front and not one of them bothered to greet or seat us. So we picked a table ourselves. Took another 5 minutes for them to bring the tea and menus. Ordered some spring rolls to start and each of us order a bowl of pho. The order took forever! The bowls of noodles came before the spring rolls, which they actually forgot about. I reminded them and the rolls finally came they were the size of my pinky and I have tiny hands. Those 6 pieces cost us $6! WTF!?  I will never come to this place again. Unless you want to get robbed of your money, I suggest you stay away."}
{"text":"I've tried different places and it doesn't come close to this Pho place. I've been coming here for over 10 years and my week won't be complete without stopping by for their soup"}
{"text":"Delicious Pho I have finally found thee! I've been to Tea Lite Cafe (too far for frequent visits), Maxim and Pho Thanh. I tried Pho House on a whim, and was blown away by the flavor and portion size! I ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien(beef pho with meatballs and sliced beef) and when I got home the noodles were ready to go, no boiling required.  The broth had good body, a beefy flavor, and nice anise undertones.  I got plenty of meatball chunks, and I liked that they were a bit salty.  The sliced beef was tender NOT chewy like Maxim's. It came with all the usual suspects: basil, cilantro, jalapeno, sprouts, chili paste, and hoisin. All fresh and the chili paste was nice and fiery. I also got the Goi cuon (rice paper rolls w/shrimp) and thought they were pretty good, not as good as Pho Thanh. Fresh with a good peanut sauce, but too much lettuce.  You have to try this place. The location isn't great, but you won't sacrifice quality or quantity by getting takeout!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has really gone downhill! I remember it being a decent restaurant a few years ago, so I decided to stop by for dinner after a long time. We ordered spring rolls, chicken vermicelli and bowl of tom yum soup and the entire meal was such a disappointment. The spring rolls had the smell of reused oil, the chicken was too cold and dry and the soup had no flavour. We basically had to cover our meals in hot sauce to add some flavour. Definitely NOT coming back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"My go to Vietnamese restaurant for Pho. Minimal MSG in the broth and most importantly, the best service I've had from any Vietnamese restaurant in the city. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So we only venture out to other Gerrard pho places when Bach yen is closed. pho house does not compare (no one does) but out of all of them, they are the next best. HUGE portions, so if you are just out for quantity this may be your place. Servers are nice too, and they take debit."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that the service and food are so poor.  The servers are like robots, they barely mumble a word.  Huge potential and convenient location, but clearly some unhappy people here.  The pad thai is the weakest, excess sauce and shrimp that tasted like paper (frozen, thawed, refrozen)I have had in Toronto. I hate to write a marginal review, but as a person who eats out every day, there are better places to spend your money and time.  I hope the owners read this review and turn their business around. I have eaten there twice and both times were weak.  Nice space but  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Maybe this is just not the place to get your food to go. First of all let me say this, pho than blows the place out of the water (price wise, portion size, and taste) Vietnamese is my all time favorite food so I've had much to compare it too. The #6 beef pho I ordered was small for the price, and I was give about 1/4 cup of meat to add the my soup. The meat ball parts of it was not good. At all. And the worst part of the whole meal was the over priced shrimp spring rice paper rolls, I had to remove the shrimp because the poop was not cleaned out of them at all. It looks as though there wasn't even an attempt to clean them. I can only hope that they would make better efforts for their dine in customers but even then, the place is a shack. I wasn't even sure if it was an open running business until I peeked in the door. Not good. Unfortunately this place was a bust. It's too bad, because i really did have higher hopes."}
{"text":"This used to be a good spot with warm delicious food good for its ambiance as well. Things have changed the green curry js under salted, bland and cold. The pad Thai tasted like sweet chilli sauce with bits of uncooked cold in the center beef on rice noodles. I hope things change but I created a yelp account to share my experience and hopefully warn my community."}
{"text":"I love Pho and I have tried it all over the city. Pho house is the best I've had and it boils down to the broth. I think the beef and noodles part of this dish is easy and I want a broth that has me tipping the bowl for every last drop. I also really like the grilled chicken and pork chop served on either rice or vermicelli (bun) - tons of flavour and the noodles are perfect. I almost always get an order of deep fried spring rolls and finish the meal with deep fried bananas.  This is not fine dining, a pretty typical family operated Vietnamese diner. The service is excellent. I go here for the food, which is top notch. Also, it's a great value, the cost is very fair for the portions you receive."}
{"text":"growing up with a vietnamese mother i ate and still eat pho every other day. since moving to the arcadia area i have looked for somewhere close. i will still continue the search. Pho House was ok. the location is great, and the food was passable, but maybe i am just spoiled. i didnt enjoy the spring rolls (fried egg roll), and the summer rolls were just ok. the Pho was decent, but nothing compared with Da Vang. i will continue going to the west side to get my fix between visits to moms house."}
{"text":"This place is at a great location, just steps from Kipling Station and ten minute drive from the gardiner, QEW and highway 427.  There should never be a problem to get here.  After eating, may we suggest Starbucks for coffee since it's right beside the restaurant?  There's lots of seating, the service is very efficient and fast.  You usually never wait to get a seat even though it's busy in there.  The kitchen is near the back, washroom's down the stairs, and the bar is by the kitchen.  They have booths and tables along the walls with some tables in the middle.  As an appetizer, we tried their Salad Wrap, which has pork, vermicelli noodles and lettuce wrapped in rice paper.  Simply dip this in the Hoisin Sauce topped with peanuts.  It's light, refreshing and delicious.    The main dish - Pho (pronounced \"fuh\").  There's many variety of pho.  They all have the same broth and noodles but you can choose what meat parts that you get.  We like to get the simple noodles with rare beef slices (order number P5).  Other pho-fenatics do go for tripes and tendons (how brave).    The broth is very hearty and flavourful with chewy noodles.  Add some hot sauce for those who like a little spiciness in their noodle soup.  They sell the bowls here in a few different sizes: Small, Medium, Large and XLarge (not sure).  Small is pretty small so I would suggest going for the Medium size as a meal.   Next time you have a Pho craving, try this place!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY.  I went to Pho House last week and had a terrible experience.  Not only did the waiter forget to punch in my order (I ordered wonton soup).. I got my food 15 minutes after my boyfriend had already finished eating his food.. So when I finally get the soup, after two bites I notice something black floating around in it (pretty easily noticeable as wonton soup is clear)... RAT FECES .. YES RAT POO. in my Pho... I call over the waiter to inform him.. he laughs, says sorry and walks away.  Still charging us for the meal...  DO NOT EVER COME HERE IT IS DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Soup was ok, it was spicy but no taste. Very clean for a pho restaurant, won't go back again. Soup tasted like it came out of a package. I've had better."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in chinatown, if you lived there before You gotta know this Pho house. Lately they have switched owners  but the food still remained the same. I gotta say this is probably the best pho restaurant in dt. Price is relatively fair compared to 88. Their portion of pho noodles seems to be big and the soup base is very clear and tasty. Definitely legit and owned by vietnamese people. I am always there when ever I am in Chinatown."}
{"text":"this place is alright. was looking for a quick and cheap bite to eat so if that's what you're after, it'll do just fine.   the lettuce in the rolls didn't seem very fresh. pho broth was good but it wasn't as \"loaded\" with beef as some of the other places in the city.   i'm on a one-woman mission to try all the pho places on this strip and this is my first stop. looking forward to trying the other places too."}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant in Toronto so far.  The owner and waiters are really nice and friendly (unlike most Vietnamese restaurants).   I always get the Pho tai and the Com suon nuong (grilled pork chops with rice) and they never fail to satisfy my Pho craving. It's not perfect. Broth is sometimes a little bland. But it's still better than most places out there. The Cha gio (deep fried spring rolls) are very crispy and yummy!!   I wouldn't bother visiting any other pho restaurant in this area!"}
{"text":"Good sized portions, good quality food, but some dishes are a little bland. A good option to have in the area and worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is a reliable Viet joint in the Gerrard street micro-Chinatown area. I say \"reliable\" because my mom and I went in half an hour before closing on a Tuesday night and the food was awesome!   What sets this apart from other viet places is that the buhn hoi (plate with roasted meats, vegetables and noodles that usually comes with lettuce for customers to make their own wrapped rolls) came with rice paper and hot water to soak it in. Everything was super savory. I can't believe this grilled beef bun hoi was $9?!  The green mango and chicken salad was also super fresh and soothing. The beef brisket tomato noodle was not super spot on--the beef brisket was tender but the soup itself was a bit too greasy. (I'm pretty sure some people wouldn't mind it though; beef grease has it's own beefy charms...)  All in all things came to something like $23 which was a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since I was 3 years old. Back then it used to be under the \"88\" chain. This is my favourite restaurant in the world. Their minced shrimp on sugar cane with spring roll and vermicelli is my favourite.  Everyone who works there is incredibly nice and are always welcoming.  I moved to the west end about a year ago but still make the trek every now and then due to serious cravings. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Ok, not bad, not great. We will get this as takeout for dinner in a pinch, but it isn't anything spectacular. The Green Mango on Bloor is a thousand times better."}
{"text":"Absolutely NOT!   This place is disguisting and I am not just talking about the food. The environment was so gross that I actually ended up NOT eating my Pho!   I went and there were literally two people in there, and yet their were dishes sitting on tables, and behind the section where you go to the restroom. Flies flying around, it was just nasty!  Let's not even get to the restroom. I ended up not using it because it was so nasty.   When you order a drink, it's a can and no refills for 1.75..... They serve nasty tap water, with no lemon or anything. It was just a hot ass mess. For the amount I paid and what I DIDN'T eat... and I didn't even bother telling the guy I wasn't happy because it would have just ended with me leaving even more unhappy.   Moral od the story is... don't go here. I seriously wish I would have taken pictures!!!!"}
{"text":"Excited for a new Vietnamese restaurant; there aren't many in this area.  Maxim is my favorite restaurant based on quality of food, but the service has become very unfriendly (to the point that I feel uncomfortable even picking up my food there).  Rice Paper down the street from me is good, but a little pricey and trendy for an ethnic restaurant (and the \"mix-ins\" they provide with the pho are VERY MUCH lacking [no cilantro!]).  At Pho House, I ordered takeout of beef pho (I ordered it with no beef, just noodles and broth... my vegetarian compromise) and the shrimp spring rolls.  The broth had a much stronger beef flavor than the balance I'm used to at Maxim.  Tasted a little overpowering to me, but I still enjoyed a good bowl of pho.  They didn't skimp on the mix-ins :) And the noodles were separated from broth, but soft, not requiring any further boiling at home.  Shrimp rolls tasted great, but I did not realize they came with pork inside also (menu didn't specify).  Wonderful, friendly service.  Looking forward to trying more of their food."}
{"text":"The wonton soup smelled and looked really good. The broth was just right but the actual wonton wasn't the best i've ever had. I'd go back if I was in the neighborhood. Good service and the food came out really quick."}
{"text":"Not the best Vietnamese place in Phoenix.  And not the cheapest.  And not the cleanest.  And not the friendliest staff.  With all of that being said, it's good Vietnamese food and there isn't a lot of Pho places around this area.  And don't get me wrong, the place isn't expensive...it's just more expensive than many of the Phoenix Pho places I've been to.  I will be going back.  Probably for take-out next time."}
{"text":"Got the thin sliced beef and beef meatball pho  Dirt dirt cheap, fresh ingredients, friendly service. Broth, slightly dark, somewhat sweet.  I personally like a more beefy less sweet broth.  It was almost as if hoisin was in the broth or some herbs were already cooked with the broth?    The beggar dude that came up to my friend before we got in the restaurant was a lil scary but was expected at the shady location so don't be all uppity then try and drive to soufside and get surprised when you get mad dogged by scary looking individual.  who cares... you're in THEIR hood dummy :/"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch. Fresh pork and shrimp roll where good. The rare beef pho was not that great. The broth was sub-par, however this place was quite clean compared to other pho restaurants."}
{"text":"My family and I do have Pho here occasionally, mainly because it's close to our house.  I do believe that since it first opened Management has changed hands, and it's a much better place than it used to be.  We went just after it had opened its doors a couple of years ago, the service wasn't great, and my son found a \"fly\" in his soup.  They waiter didn't even blink at that, or offer to remove the dish from our bill.  HOWEVER in the past year it has much improved, service is very good and fast.  Pho is good, I've had much better other places in the city but it gives me my \"fix\" when I'm craving it."}
{"text":"There aren't many good Pho places in the West end but Pho house is decent. They have a typical Thai/Vietnamese menu with a few Pho soups to choose from.   When this place opened up last year, the Pho wasn't that great and had too much ginger. But they've since imrpoved the taste and it's quite good.   If I'm craving Pho and don't want to trek it to Chinatown, Pho house is where I go."}
{"text":"They're fast,  friendly, and reasonably priced. Food is fine for my taste. It's decorated well enough. If your looking for pho then my all means this location should sate your cravings."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The only restaurant I'll eat pho, & I drive from Brampton just to eat here."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Like most of the places in East Chinatown this place has no frills. Most of the food is tasty and done well.  This is my go to place in Riverdale because of the service and the staff. They are absolutely incredible, friendly, and always have a smile on their faces.  I think the food tastes better because of the service.  I like it.  That's it!"}
{"text":"This was my first Pho experience. I know i know... what took me so long, right? Well, i am a big fan of noodles, and i love broth, but i dunno... Pho never really pulled me in. Today i dove into the Pho.  The place was really nicely decorated and very clean and crisp. I started with the Vegetable Spring rolls. So yummy! Then I got a small bowl of the Rare Beef Pho. It was ok. I tried it before i added anything to it, but was then told that i needed to squeeze a bunch of the lime, basil and coriander into it. Pretty good. But what really kicked it up for me was the addition of the much beloved Sriracha Rooster sauce. Ahh, much better. Before the Rooster kick, it was lacking a little somethin' for me.  I'll definitely go back to Pho House again, but i do want to try a new dish."}
{"text":"Yay! This area of town has been in need of some good pho. The owners are very friendly and eager to please, coming by to make sure we were enjoying everything. We had the egg rolls, shrimp spring rolls, pho ga (chicken pho), and pho dak biet (beef pho with all the funky animal parts). The prices were good, the broth was flavorful, and service was prompt and friendly. They were accommodating and very willing to adjust my order to a variation not listed on the menu.  It is definitely a kind of divey place, reminiscent of pho tanh (sp?) and da vang. They had some drinks that looked delicious too! I will be back very soon--I'm so happy this place is open!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately didn't like my meal the both times I tried it there. It is convenient that you can take out and it's quick but it was the worst Thai food I even had. I'm vegetarian so I grabbed a tofu based meal and it tasted bland and like the veggies cooked forever before. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just brought takeout noodle soups and threw them out.  The well done beef and the chicken rice noodle soups.  Poor quality of meat put us off eating.  One of the booths across from the cash is being used as an office and cutlery prep station.  Including old shoes and files.  Will never eat there."}
{"text":"Their pho isn't the greatest pho, but it's good enough for me to be a repeat customer. Besides there isn't many pho restaurants in the area to choose from. I've always been seated quickly. Service is quick. Staff are friendly enough. Prices are reasonable enough. However, I do have one tidbit... Each time I've dined here, I've always received my spring rolls AFTER my soup..."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving a bowl of pho. She lives right by this place and swears by it. I was quite good satisfied with my seafood soup with pho noodles. It was filling and well priced. The spring rolls were also decent, nothing above average but also nothing to complain about. I just wish the atmosphere was cozier."}
{"text":"Good food and good price never disappoints ... I like the pho noodle soup my kids in special love it , the basil spice pad thai is really good, today I have tried the coconut Tom yum chicken soup  was so good... , highly recommended and if you pay in cash they give you 10% off"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday morning with my wife. We started with the sugarcane wrapped with shrimp which was pretty good. I then had the pho dac biet. I dont know what was going on maybe the fridge was broken or something but my pho was sour as well as the meat. My wife had the bun rieu where the noodles were undercooked and the soup was flavorless. We were not able to finish our meals (basically let them untouched) and i went up to pay (cashier did not ask if angthing was wrong). So we definitely will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I went there recently for the first time and loved the food!  I had the Cantonese chow mein and it was delicious - exactly what I had been craving!  It's a nice little spot in a very convenient location!  I can't wait to go back to try other items on their large menu!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for pho ...we ordered #79 and it was great...we will be back :) recommend asking for basil, extra peanuts and extra sauce with #79... Enjoy!  Also loved getting the cup of green tea right away on a cold day..."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see a new Vietnamese restaurant open up, but was weary of trying it after reading the bad reviews. I'm a huge fan of Pho Than and Da Vang, but am not a fan of driving into the avenues to get it. I would say that this was almost as good, we tried the beef pho, pork and eggroll noodle bowl, and I had a Vietnamese iced coffee. Da Vang was a little bit more flavorful, but this is a good second and it's closer. Also, the service was pretty good, we didn't have a problem at all. The prices were super cheap and the portions were huge. 3 of us split a bowl of pho and the noodle bowl and we were full for about $5 per person, and there was still food left over! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is our go to pho place in this area. Big yummy bowls with lots of flavour. The other dishes my friends order have also been given a thumbs up (I always order pho). Service is pretty good and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I cannot comment on the pho, however I had the Singapore Noodles which were very good! They're very flavourful thanks to the oyster sauce they use.  The fried tofu with peanut sauce was pretty good. I've had better peanut sauces although theirs isn't bad. The tofu was cut very large however; too big for the mouth and the middle was bland (which is to be expected but there was a lot of blandness due to the large pieces). If definitely return for their affordable prices and good food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pho restaurants! Delicious and cheap!!! :) they're so friendly and I definitely recommend you to come here to satisfy your pho craving! Trust me, you won't regret it! Uhhh am I the only one who's craving for a nice hot bowl of pho now?"}
{"text":"I got the tom yum goong...and it was so sad looking. A few pieces of broccoli, carrot halves, and two pieces of chicken. (See picture). It was hot and sour, but didn't taste like tom yum.   Would be giving this place a 2 just for the soup. But my friend got the pho and his rating for the pho is 3.5. Another friend got the bun with shrimp and chicken and his rating for it is 3. He also got the fresh roll with avocado and shrimp and would give that a 2. That being said, all I tried was the soup! But rounding up to 3 because their other dishes probably tasted better, and their bean sprouts and basil leaves looked fresh."}
{"text":"a cozy family owned place with delicious food & good service. came here on a Friday night with a couple of friends to grab a bite before heading home.  good stuff, would try again :)"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot!   Food: 4/5 (vermicelli) favours on point, decent portions, fair pricing  Service: 4.5/5 fast and friendly service Ambiance: 4.5/5 nice renos, comfortable seating, busy but not excessive, clean"}
{"text":"Pros: Great pho at a reasonable cost, fast service.  Cons: Milk tea was of average quality.  Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Just what you need when you need it cheap and quick. Love Love the green curry!!! Portions are good and staff are attentive."}
{"text":"The decor is indeed nice and clean and friendly service.  Pho tastes like it came out of a package. Big servings on the desserts though.  Still no good pho in the west end :("}
{"text":"NEW PHO SHOP! (1/18/2012)  After first seeing the signs for Pho House getting put up a few weeks ago, I knew I had to try this place immediately. This part of Phoenix needed a little Vietnamese dive. Every time I'm sitting at home and have a pho craving, I always have to think in \"miles away.\" It's not always convenient to have to drive ten plus miles for a decent bowl of pho (and by not always, I mean never).    Well, I had dinner there tonight and I can already strongly recommend a bowl of their pho dac biet! Consistency will be key, but the broth was definitely one of the better  pho broths that I've had in the city. Along with the pho, I tried a spring roll and an egg roll. The spring roll was tasty and fresh, and the egg roll was crunchy and delicious! I'd order both again. If you've had good spring/egg rolls at other Viet spots, you'll know what you'll be getting. Oh, and one more thing... no chili oil as of yet. I'm sure that could change in the future, but I was a tiny bit bummed.  I think Pho House is totally starting on the right path with its food and friendly service, and if they keep it up, I could see it being a busy little neighborhood restaurant. It's really in a perfect spot that lacks close competition. C'mon, Arcadians and East Phoenicians, go try it and write a review!"}
{"text":"Good menu and friendly service but food is a bit inconsistent ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}
{"text":"An ideal spot to share lunch with two couples (four people). A good meal for 4 is a mango salad, a special pho (medium size), vermicelli with BBQ pork and spring roll, and fresh spring rolls.  I recommend a green tea pot as drink because it goes well with the food.  The mall has ample parking and there's other stores here like shoppers drug smart"}
{"text":"Ordered $100 worth of food delivery. Told us visa was okay but demanded cash on delivery. Told us that it would take 30-40 mins but took 1.25 hrs. Everything came in a cardboard box where everything leaked everywhere. Missed one item: small special pho and when it arrived it came with a lot of broth but no noodles and had one beef ball. Would not recommend. I rather not eat at all."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. It's convenient and the price is not so bad. The staff is tolerable, some are not very welcoming at all but we still go coz we like the food. But one time my bf ordered Satay soup and there is a bug! a fly to be specific. The waiter wasnt even sorry, he just took away the soup to change. he said sorry after but he doesnt look sorry at all! usually if stuff like that happens the management gives you discount or some incentive. none of that happened. lost our appetite. such a waste of money. never going back there again! We will just go to mekong river, service is much better and price is a bit cheaper"}
{"text":"After specificaly requesting no rice due to allergies they filled the whole box with rice so none of it was edible. When i called to tell them they didnt pick up 5 phone calls. This could have been a very serious reaction. There was also shrimp in on of the soups that was vegetarian."}
{"text":"Being surrounded by other great Vietnamese food places this one does not live up to standard had #63 and it would have to be my least fav. I mean like it wasn't bad was hungry and finished it all but within a 3 minute walk I could have enjoyed what I ordered a little more for the same price. Glad I have it I try and I do like the fact that it is open till 11pm and they accept cash and credi"}
{"text":"Classic pho place! Came here once with my boyfriend, the prices were fantastic and the portions were generous. They have BBQ beef/pork pho which I found interesting as this is the first time I saw that menu item. The establishment itself could use some renovations but nothing too crazy"}
{"text":"The most authentic Pho Tai I've ever had.  Great food.  I go there about once a week and the iced coffee keeps me up for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Pho House is OK but my issue was with the cost of tea! I asked for a green tea ( Which is usually complimentary  ) but they didn't have green tea. (???) So I had jasmine tea. It was strong and unpalatable. They charged $2.50 + tax for a tea bag and hot water! I told the server about it and he smiled, said that's the price, and that was it. He didn't care. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible pho! A waste of money and time . -Pho was oily  -Beef was of the lowest quality with a yellow tinge of tumours. -No complimentary tea  -I had to put my pho spoon on top of a bunch of napkins because they don't provide the little disk . Many better pho places near by,steer clear of this place . The only person who would say that this is good pho doesn't know what good pho is."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really in the mood for pho last week during the big rainstorm we had in the valley but we didn't want to drive all the way to Da Vang even though it's our staple pho joint. We were the only people in Pho House when we arrived so we were served quickly (though the server did not come to the table once to ask how we were doing) but I was extremely disappointed that their vegetarian pho has absolutely no vegetables in it besides some floating onion and they do not carry tofu at all.  The luxurious, filling pho that I always enjoy at Da Vang was replaced by a bowl of broth and noodles.  In the future I will be driving the extra few miles to you Da Vang - I will not cheat on you again!"}
{"text":"This is my new pho house. I formerly went to Peach Garden about 10 minutes east on Gerrard. But since then I've bad experiences there. I've changed my venue to this restaurant and enjoy it so so much. The pho is great, with reasonable prices. The owner is extremely friendly and always chats with me and my family on every visit. But it really is the consistent food quality and friendly staff that keep me coming back whenever I have a craving. Service is fast based on what you order, pho being the quickest item to hit the table. If you're in the area, don't bother with the other pho places, go straight to Pho House!"}
{"text":"As two vegetarians whom have eaten at every possible Pho restaurant (that serves veggie broth), this was an OK meal.  Nothing spectacular. Decor - way way better than your typical Pho places - but it lacked the simplicity that the great restaurants have.  Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Well, my experience at the Pho House was right on the money; 3-stars and \"A-OK\".  Not \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" or \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\".  The verdict:  +++GOOD+++ 1. Beautiful clear broth (wow!) 2. Nice tender pieces of tendon 3. Lots of fresh bean sprouts and basil 4. Great ass on the female server 5. Potent hoisin sauce that hasn't been cut by copious amounts of water  ---BAD--- 1. Raw beef was sort of clumped together (cooked before I had a chance to untangle the beef mass) 2. Although the broth was nice and clear, it was a couple tablespoons away from being near flavorless.  They are playing Russian roulette with their broth recipe! 3. Dry noodles, not fresh  Overall, I would eat here again but won't make a habit of it.  I prefer Xe Lua across the street because of the fresh noodles, but wouldn't complain if I was forced to eat here."}
{"text":"The pho is apparently a hit or a miss The summer roll didn't seem well filled to me but the rest of my party of 3 really enjoyed it. We did all love the packed flavor given off by the mint. I had a rice dish, with porkchop and egg. It was good but left me dissatisfied because while each of the elements were excellently executed, I was expecting what I got at other Vietnamese restaurants, i.e. all the fixins. But nope, just literally, pork chop, egg & rice. And a small vinaigrette salad.  So again, good food. Not what I wanted or expected."}
{"text":"I go to Pho House on the reg. My partner and I go at least two times a month. I always get one type of pho or another and he gets the shanghai noodles. I would be lying if I didn't say  I love this place.   The service is almost always fast and usually friendly (however some of the assistant servers act robotic at times).  The seats are starting the experience a bit of wear-and-tear, but that's to be expected as it has been open for a while now and gets a lot of traffic. Some upkeep to the upholstery would help maintain it's image."}
{"text":"Randomly out West of the city and stopped by this place. Decor is very clean and modern but that was the best part.  Spring rolls were surprisingly tasty---shrimp filled too.  But then the pho was bland and the pad thai came out in a soggy mess. Not great but overall could pass through if you're hungry."}
{"text":"been coming here since they first opened and was still a pho 88. probably my favourite place at the moment for pho but for chicken/pork chop rice I would still head over down the street to Mi Mi's"}
{"text":"Lived close by so we were regulars at the Pho House.  Quick service and their Vietnamese rolls and Bun (beef or chicken with spring rolls on vermicelli with nuoc cham) are exceptional."}
{"text":"The bahn mi is pretty tasty.  Crusty bread, pork patties.  The spring roll is meh and the bun is down right disappointing.  The meat has less flavor and tastes really of char.  I'm used to going to scary places in interesting neighborhoods for good food, but this place is pretty scary, even for someone used to hanging out next to K-Mo Mo.  If the food was good, I'd totally brave it, but between looking out for my car and being sad that my bun was ice cold (I mean I know it is supposed to be room temperature but this was close to ice cold and barely cooked through).  The egg rolls are some of the most depressing things I've had in awhile, looked like sausage wrapped in crunchy paper.  So maybe if you are going to have just bahn mi (which is a steal at 2.95 a piece) I'd avoid the rest of the menu, which is actually the most limited menu I've seen in a Vietnamese restaurant.  Oh and the staff started making eyes at me to leave at 8:30 p.m., I don't mind surly, but don't kick me out!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I kept it simple (C8) and it had flavour but not over done. Place is super clean and the service was friendly. I will come back."}
{"text":"Oh Pho-get about it!  However, please remember to arm yourselves when attending Pho House. This place is in a very sketchy area, but if I can risk my life for a burrito I can risk my life for some Pho.  My partner and I both ordered a bowl of Pho.  I like my Pho basic and so far so good, no shots fired.  I thought the Pho was pretty good here since my expectations were pretty low with just looks alone.  The broth was nice and hot and their vegetables were fresh and full of scent!    If you're afraid of these places I recommend you stay away.  The place is pretty plain, but they do have a LCD screen to maybe catch a game or two.  Service needs more umph, but I gather it's more of a language barrier than anything. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here! The food is always fresh service fairly quick and good delicious! Try any of the Pho soups but also the Bun dishes are great! Especially with the spring roll. Soo good!"}
{"text":"Definatelly amazing Pho, this is the first time we come to this place. Really fast service, the portions are really generous, the broth is really flavourful, the noodles super nice and soft, good portions of meat and the price is really affordable. We also had fried spring rolls and cold rolls, super tasty. You have to try the Pho here!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review... While the food is ok the service is horrific and they constantly spray cleaner on tables next to you which  ruins your eating experience, once I smell cleaner everything tastes different. Then as soon as your done your meal you get a bill shoved on your table... Nice. No one asks how everything is or if you'd like dessert... I won't be going back."}
{"text":"HORRENDOUS.  the worst pho in Toronto, and definitely etobicoke!  Gross, fatty, questionable tasting and looking meat. The broth is just plain bad.  Where is ZERO stars!? Hello yelp??  I never complain but I had to mention how bad it was, completely ignored; just pay and get the F out!  Avoid at all costs, Mekong down the street is 4 stars, and great staff, miserable at pho house."}
{"text":"I like this better than a nearby place, they take debit.  The food is good, big menu of items.  BBQ chicken rolls very good! Excellent rare beef, the white chicken in soup not so good."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch pretty often as its close to my work ..it's pretty clean and food is decent ..never been disappointed . Staff is nice ...be warned though the lunch rush and dinner rush does get busy ..so come a little before the rush to get a seat ."}
{"text":"This place always satisfies my pho craving. The soup is not overly salty or greasy, and the bean sprouts they serve on the side are always clean and crisp. Service is usually very prompt, although sometimes it's faster to just go up to the service desk to pay. Parking is free and ample."}
{"text":"Decor is the best part about this place.  Most pho huts do not look this nice.  Clean and good service.  The food was okay.  Good enough in terms of quality of ingredients, but didn't quite get the flavoring the way I like.  I ordered the pho and I've definitely had better but it wasn't bad.  My 3 kids had no problems with their stirfrys and they can be picky.  However we have been back numerous times since this first experience so guess it passed the test!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I insist on pho-ing in the East but it's probably cuz I live here! LOL I have had way more disappointments than good pho and yet I keep coming back for more, sad.  Pho House is like any other pho place along this strip; outdated, grimy and lonely in the night. It seems at any given moment they can shudder yet somehow they manage to stay alive, clinging on to the this thread they call a lifeline.  Stories aside. Their menu is vast like the great sea. With items from land to sea and back! Viet, Chinese and even Thai favourites are here but of course I went for the lowly pho and fresh rolls - peasants food. The pho broth is subpar at best as it tasted very generic like most pho broths from a cube. The beef is mediocrity at it's finest and the lack of it in the bowl only added to the insult. The only gleaming highlight was the noodles(and you get lots of it) that was perfectly al dente. We continue with the same theme of less is less and oodles of noodles with the fresh rolls. Mountains of noodles neatly wrapped with a single slice of bbq chicken with ends that tasted a bit chewy like it was made this morning. The vermicelli? Do you even have to ask! Refer to the theme statement.  But that price.... that will take you back a few decades because they are so low (so low it warrants 2 stars!). Come here if you're desperate, hungry and only have a few bucks to spare. If not, then spend it at another pho place down the street; same kinda quality but you can feel richer about paying more. Move along."}
{"text":"They have nice \"pho\" here, not really the best in town but still nice yo eat. \"Bun rieu\" is pretty good and worth trying. The owner was friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food isn't great.   My wife was delivered the wrong type of spring roll and despite telling two servers, who said they'd get it corrected, it was not.  Probably ther most expensive pho place to which I've been."}
{"text":"Decisions, decisions, decisions...you'll have a TON of decisions at Pho House with over 400 items on their menu! This place is such a gem, I've tried many different items on their menu and have been very satisfied every time. Most items are under $10 and the food is delicious here. Will definitely come more often to fill my Asian cuisine cravings!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. I ordered the veggie pho to go and I was so impressed with how fresh all the veggies were and even the broth! The soup wasn't oily, it just tasted like soup you'd make at home which made me feel great because I had the flu. Their service was fast (even though they were really busy) and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Me and my husband's sick day regular spot. Number 112 pho, deep fried tofu, and fresh beef spring rolls are our go-to. I love pho, so I tried a bunch of different places, but this place is the best for us. When they just made a new broth it is not as good, so try it couple times before you make up your mind. haha. Owner's a bit shy but if they get to know you they treat you like a family :) Super nice. Great price as well! Love their coffee smoothie and mango salad at summer time as well."}
{"text":"i hate leaving bad reviews but i went cause the place reviews so well and HOW it got the 4/5 stars is beyond me lol bun rieu may as well have been boiled tomatoes"}
{"text":"Pho House is my new viet joint in the Etobicoke/Mississauga area. I love the interior design and the comfy booths. The staff were all fast and very efficient. Ordered grilled beef bun (vermicilli) and it was so tasty. The food came out so fast I couldnt believe it at first. I will be coming here again and again if it keeps up like this. 5 ***** stars. :D"}
{"text":"I give this place five stars despite all the other reviews...  I have only ever ordered to go from this place and I get the same thing every time, pho tai.  This is a great place for pho in this area but if you are easily turned off from a restaurant by the looks of it this may not be the place for you.  It is definite an older place and would probably benefit from a makeover but bottom line is that the pho is wonderful, the people are always nice and its a great price ($7.10 out the door - recently raised prices)."}
{"text":"Gingers has nothing on the Pho House! I had their veggi pho and a Taro milkshake - both were delicious, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic Vietnamese food! You can definitely smell the pho broth the moment you walk inside. If you're an avid coffee drinker, order their Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da) because they make it exactly how you'd see it in Vietnam.   Food was fresh!"}
{"text":"Where's my half star? I would like to give them a 2.5 star rating because they're smack dab in the middle. I ordered my traditional at Vietnamese restaurants; spring roll and combination bun (A1 goi cuon and B1 Bun tom thit nuong cha gio on this menu) to go. There were barely any peanuts; they were with the pork on the side, but what was most disappointing was there was no fresh mint, green onions, carrots or cilantro. It was only lettuce, cucumbers and sprouts. The fish sauce was virtually water. The rolls weren't special either. That being said.... the BBQ pork was fantastic. I enjoyed my meal, but it wasn't what I wanted. Also, if you use their website, all prices are $1 more than what's posted, even the $2.25 spring rolls were an extra dollar. Even though I was told this on the phone after placing the order, I still feel that should be addressed. As others have said, the interior and exterior is lacking, but I found the workers fast and courteous. I'll probably be back, but I may bring my own vegetables next time."}
{"text":"I'd been to Pho many times and was never disappointed. But my last experience was awful and my last.  To start, there was lipstick on my glass that the waiter or kitchen staff had attempted to hide with a lime.   Both my friend and I ordered the chicken pho soup. The chicken was all the meat that should be thrown away but instead, these scraps had been thrown into our soups. Fat, bones... it was disgusting. The soup itself was extremely salty.  We tried to eat as much of it as we could, because neither of us like to complain. But we couldn't finish it. After dinner was over, we mentioned to the staff that the chicken in the soup was no good. They immediately started speaking in Viet amongst eachother and giving us odd looks. They didn't once apologize and simply said, \"You should've said something earlier. The owner gets mad when customers complain about us.\" Clearly they were more concerned about being scolded by the owner than about the overall service.  I was so pissed off, I mentioned the lipstick on the glass. No apology for that either. Just more dirty looks.   On a positive note, the springs rolls were delicious and the service was good up until we mentioned how terrible the soup was."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because I was in the area with a friend! She was craving Pho and I was down for what they had to offer. I scanned the menu to see what I could eat (Pho joints are usually a little tricky because most is not all of their broths are beef/chicken/pork things I don't eat!)   I saw they had a shrimp dumping soup and they assured me the filling was solely shrimp and scallions so I ordered the dish. To my surprise, it was filling and very delicious! So delicious I would like to come back again to have the dish and share the restaurant with friends. The dumping wasn't too thick and the filling complimented the soup.   *Also tried the fresh shrimp and avocado rolls, it was delicious with the sweet hoisin sauce!   Aesthetic wise it was a cute family owned restaurant, clean but nothing extravagant. My friend who had beef pho also enjoyed her meal."}
{"text":"My family ordered take-out from here a few nights ago. We got an assortment of things, none of which was very tasty at all.   We started off with the crispy spring rolls (A2) which are supposed to have chicken but when we got home they had shrimp (A1) which was pretty disappointing. My mother got the fresh rolls and from her reaction they weren't memorable either.   My sister had the vermicelli with grilled chicken. The chicken seemed to have a breading on it which was weird since we were expecting it to be grilled. I got the vermicelli with lemongrass chicken and spicy chili. It wasn't spicy at all and the flavors were so bland. It was almost a task to even eat it.   My mom had the phuket mango with tofu and vegetables. The sauce was super runny and also had little flavor. My dad had the house fried rice with chicken. It was the only alright part of the whole meal, but how hard is it to mess that up I suppose.   Overall it was a disappointing meal and we won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"The pho place I have been looking for.  Soup was utterly perfect with broth that is not to be missed. Beef was good cuts and well cooked. Spicy was hot but also flavorful.  Restaurant was nothing fancy but exactly what you want in a little pho shop.  I will definitely be visiting again before long."}
{"text":"Average pho. Had the pho ga and there was hardly any chicken in it. We dropped in and ordered take out and they were quite quick however I would not return as there is much better pho in the city. Service is friendly however."}
{"text":"Clean tasty and pretty good value...  Good place wish they were open late night! Rare beef and beef balls is my fave pho. . Big clean new restaurant"}
{"text":"I come here with my fianc√©e almost every week for take out, so you can guess that we're big fans. The food is always hot, the service is quick and you finish with a full belly. Street parking is available on both sides of Gerrard so finding a spot is never a problem either. Inside, the restaurant looks pretty basic, but the people are nice and the food is good. Support this little local pho house and grab a bowl (and some deep fried spring rolls)!"}
{"text":"One of my regular spots. It doesn't look like much but I promise you will not be disappointed. It's a big bowl of comfort."}
{"text":"Wanted something light and nourishing to soothe my upset tummy and got the wonton soup.  It was perfect - a light, clear broth served piping hot with chives, green onions and chicken and shrimp wontons -$7.  The portion was not extremely generous but definitely not small!  Following that, I decided to try the steamed rice dish with grilled beef and fried egg, which also came with a nice little salad consisting of a few lettuce leaves, shredded carrot and (what I thought to be) cabbage -$8.50.  The beef was perfectly marinated and grilled to perfection.  There was also a lovely sour vinaigrette on the side.   My friend got the basil Thai spicy noodle with chicken and it was great; you could see that they did not skimp on the meat which is always a plus.  Although it was a little greasy, the flavour was bang on -$10.50.  All in all, the venue was clean, fairly spacious, well-decorated and pleasant to all senses.  The service was quick and attentive, the waitress spoke English quite well and the prices were very reasonable.  Tipped in cash and made sure our waitress pocketed it as there was a post a few months back about owners keeping the tips?  Not sure of the validity of that comment but I decided to play it safe.  Also, a big thumbs up to the fact that this place is not in Mississauga or downtown Toronto, and is a 5 min drive from my home!   I will definitely be coming back here and will recommend it to my friends in the area."}
{"text":"Very casual place for a quick Vietnamese warm up meal.  This place gets busy but turnover is fast so if you have to wait, like we did today, it will be less than 5 minutes. The service is pleasant and expedient.   Today we both had the Tom Yum soup with noodles. It was on our table within 5 minutes from placing our order. One of the soups was tofu and vegetable and the other soup was shrimp and chicken.   The soups usually do not come with noodles but we like to add them in and it is like a dollar or so more per soup.  Delicious soups with a serving of fresh veggies, at least, in each bowl. Big enough portions that we took about half home. And we even skipped the fresh rolls which we usually get as an appetizer.   What you get at Pho House is great value and very consistent quality with fast service.  Check it out when you can!"}
{"text":"I read several negative reviews based on service and location before I went and I must say... I'm confused!  After discovering this place last week, my boyfriend and I have been twice (once to dine in and once to take out) and both times we have had good service and great pho!  We were just there last night - the place was mostly empty so we sat ourselves, recieved a menu immediately, placed our order within a few minutes, and recieved our food within 10-15 minutes.  We both ordered pho and were both full and happy when we left :)  The broth was delish, the meat was plentiful, and it wasn't as grizzly as some other places we have been to around the valley.  The location is conveniently near the highway at McDowell and 32nd - this may not be an upscale neighborhood but it's a far cry from being dangerous.  So, like I said, two great experiences and a lot of confusion over the bad reviews. We absolutely plan to go back often!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place everytime I have been there; I have both taken out and dined in and never recieved bad service. The food was excellent; I am a huge fan of their Won Ton Soup... it's is a large portion and delicious and their cold rolls are some of the best I have EVER tasted!!  I had the coconut curry chicken the lat time I was there and it was amazing served piping hot, fresh and fast. My boyfriend got (This is the name of the dish believe it or not!) Phucket chicken I think and he adored it as well! They make a mean cantonese chow mein, chicken/beef Ho Fun and a variety of Pho soups I find the decor simple but classy and spacious; I am not a big fan of being stacked like pancakes when I'm trying to eat! Looking from the outside in it seems much smaller but it offers a lot of space, the tables are large and the seating is quite comfortable.  The menu here is excellently put together; large enough to offer a nice selection but not too big to confuse things. Precise and organized its easy to peruse your options while the staff is incredibly pleasant, knowledgable and more then willing to help.  If you like Asian/Vietnamese cuisine served with a smile and lots of free parking then you should try this place and their Bubble Tea!!"}
{"text":"Really love the Pho!  The broth was so yummy and more on the salty side then sweet, which is my favorite! The price is super reasonable! I also ordered the egg rolls and they were fantastic! I will no longer make trips all the way to Tempe or Chandler for Pho since this place opened!"}
{"text":"Great quality Pho, I ordered the medium 7.00, but they brought a large(8.00). Great flavored broth. The beef and chicken were very tender and flavorful. My dining partners had two of the stir fry dishes and both were completely satisfied. Reasonable prices and the avocado shake was equally as good. Next time in town, this is definitely on our list. There was a waiting line for lunch, so you know it is good when you see that! I noticed the Pad Thai had this awful looking orange sauce that resembled sweet/sour sauce. It sure did not appear that the sauce contained any tamarind, so I am glad I did not order that. Vietnamese is the best here. Leave the Pad Thai alone!"}
{"text":"I love Pho soups and this is an okay place. The Pho House is located in Etobicoke, close to Kipling subway station in Six Points Plaza, close to Shoppers Drug Mart. This place is very well decorated, looks bright and clean. The soups arrive very fast and are usually really good, but sometimes the chicken tastes like rubber and the soup is too salty. I usually choose chicken or veggie pho. Last time we took chicken/veggie soup.. but they charged extra $2 for veggies and there were only 2 little broccoli, 1 mushroom and 2 snow peas added. That was little dissapointing as other places gives you free veggies if you order half half and there are much more vegetables inside. But still its a good deal as large soup (can be shared for 2) costs only about $8. They have also some nice chicken/veggie/rice dishes but their curry was one of the worst."}
{"text":"GENEROUS PORTIONS! Great flavours and kind service. Try the cream cheese wontons! Nice quiet dinner if you're up to a big bowl of pho on a cold night."}
{"text":"Best Rare Beef Pho in Etobicoke by far! I recommend this to everyone! Pho portions are huge (a small is about $6 and VERY filling, and I've never seen someone order the largest one and finish it). I've also had their pad thai, and bun. I've never been disappointed in my experiences there."}
{"text":"The rare beef pho here is good but it's not the best place in the area as there are a few other options I would rather chose .... clean nice place that's inviting probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Service was great but food of was only so-so.  Fresh rolls were clearly made with old veggies and bun was mostly bean sprouts. Tofu was nice, though!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They recently moved down the street into a bigger space.  Great service and a huge menu to choose from.  Rare beef, tofu pho and bun dishes are my favourites.  Great drip coffee as well!"}
{"text":"Pho House is my go-to pho place in old chinatown (or chinatown east if you prefer).  I am going on a family vacation in 3 days and I have suddenly come down with a cough and cold combination that I needed to take care of, stat.  So off I went.  I've been eating a lot of pho this year and I have gotten to know a good bowl from a bad one.  The good: - the broth here is clear and has lots of green onions in it.  I prefer its flavour to some of the neighbouring pho offerings (in descending order; xe lua, kims and stay far far away from mi mi).  It isn't salty or heavy handed on the MSG and you can taste the beefyness in the broth. - The table setup is perfect - they have chopsticks, spoons, hoisin and hot sauce along with the dishes to mix them and other assorted condiments at the table.  I never have to flag anyone down to ask for something else, it's always there. - Easy communication - Debit (!) - Super bright and clean  The bad: - Like Neil said, the rare beef comes clumped together and cooks too fast.  I am also not a fan of the actual cut of beef they use here for this.  It is definitely budget beef. (for $5-$7 a bowl though, I guess I shouldn't complain).  It can be stringy. - The noodles are not fresh, which doesn't really bother me but it is worth noting.   The weird: The drink menu is confusing.  I always order something different just to see what I end up with.  Once I ordered 'lychee with ice' and it was exactly that... lychee fruits (whole) in a glass, with ice, and some water.    Overall, this is the place I bring people who have never had pho (just like Susan C did for me several months ago) because its reliably good and easy to order."}
{"text":"Love this place. Discovered it when the Jasmine Rice on Kipling closed down. Pho House is always fresh, fast staff, food quality is great and consistent. Highly recommend.   Pad Thai it fantastic, also recommend chicken green or red curry. Pho soups are great as well on a cold day.   If you have a baby or a toddler there is no change table in men's washroom, so just an FYI. I think there's a change table in ladies washroom."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland pho. Food is ok. I always give a place 3 tries if the food was ok the first time I go. But I only went twice. The only reason they do well is because they are in the Six Points plaza and are the only Vietnamese restaurant in the Kipling & Dundas area."}
{"text":"I've been going here for nearly 15 years. I have hardly worked by way through the menu because I love the following dishes so much, I never get to others. Fried spring rolls, cold rolls with shrimp or grilled chicken, pho sate, tofu vegetable pho, grilled chicken vermicelli, and grilled pork chop on rice.   The cooks and staff are lovely."}
{"text":"Very fresh and home made food. Pretty good pho, One of those I will return. Fresh rolls are also to have."}
{"text":"This is our first time at Pho House, which was recommended by a co-worker. The place was dark. The floor needed vacuuming, but the tables were decent. We ordered the fresh spring rolls as appetizer. They were OK, but the sauce needs work. It was watery with very little peanuts in it. We had Pho soup with meatballs which was average. The vegetables were not as fresh as they should have been. The bean sprouts looked and felt like they were sitting next to a hot stove as they were limpy and partially cooked.   My biggest complaint is the condiment containers (Hoisin, soy sauce, Sriracha) were very dirty. The caps were crusted with dried up sauce and looked like they never got cleaned - ever). We were so disgusted that we didn't use any of them.   The two young girls who waited on us looked like they had no restaurant experience at all. They came to take our orders and disappeared. We had to keep calling them for things. We will not be back at this place.   The best Pho restaurant for us will still be Unphogettable inside the Mekong Plaza on Dobson and Main in Mesa."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very near to my school and has good service here.  I tried Pho and if u like spicy, u can order sicpy satay soup, more delecious.  One time I tried Bun Thit Nuong and this is not yummy but also not too bad, still okei but I dont like it.  The wrost food here is Thailand food, I tried 2 times, one was green curry, one was Pad Thai. OMG so yucky.  I still give 4 stars bc vietnamese food still yummy, service good, serve food fast, background clean."}
{"text":"Quite a busy place!  Had to wait about 15 min for a table for 3 on Friday evening!  For a pho place not authentic pho and size was very small for a small... $7.50 for a small--suppose it's better than eatting fast food.  However if you want a true bowl of pho--head downtown/elsewhere.  Service was very very good for a Vietnamese pho restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"The fresh rolls and sanwiches are worth 4 or 5 stars, the value is worth even more than that (the food is CHEAP!), the only thing holding this place back from a higher review is it's a total dump.  I'm OK with it not being flashy, in fact I think that's an ambiance all its own, but the place just doesn't feel very clean.   The bottles of sauce on the tables are always slimy from prior use, and I always feel like I should wash my hands after handling them.  But again, teh food?  You can get out of here at lunch with a belly full of delicious food for under $7.  Crazy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times after my initial failed experience and I have to admit they've gotten better.  This place still pales in comparison to its cheaper and tastier downtown competition but for Etobicoke it's not bad."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are hot, fast and fresh. Hit or miss on the food however the pho is ok.  $10 or less for a pho. Crispy wontons are small. I always come here for lunch, it's clean, spacious and has fast service. More expensive than other PHO houses however this is worth a try if you're looking for pho."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Wandering around this part of town looking for food after some drinks.... Every restaurants looked empty and closed...until the nice people at Pho House waved at us and signalled us to come in!  We ordered a 101 Medium and Large.. and I don't think I would ever order a Large as the portion is huge. The broth was flavoured and savoury, really hit the spot on a cold winter night. The spring roll was crispy and delicious! Love the rice paper wrapping!  Even after their closing time, we never felt rushed or like some of other restaurants I been to when they started mopping the floor hinting that we should leave.  I definitely be back to Pho House next time when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here; the food is good but the service is even better!  I've only had the Chicken Rice Noodle Soup (Pho) but unfortunately I'm not impressed with the chicken they put in their soup. It seems to be over-cooked and dry (how that's possible in a soup...I'm not sure! And the quality of the chicken needs improvement).   The service is always great. They've always got more staff in than they need, but it's great because you're seated and served quickly.   I had the Pho the other day, and it literally came out in 2 minutes. I was starving, so I was very appreciative. The 2 times I had gone in there, there were maybe 5 or 6 tables occupied and tons more available.   If you want your quick fix of Pho, it's definitely worth a try. I will probably be trying the Rare Beef next time, as the chicken left me less than impressed (reason for the 3 stars).   I will definitely visit again should I need a Pho fix!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Place for stroller and good parking. We had a fab time and enjoyed the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"The design of this pho place is meant for the eyes of the upper middle class. The place is quite fancy for your typical pho restaurant, but it's not as authentic. The actual pho isn't as tasty, they don't give you the right exact utensils and sauces as the traditional pho restaurant, and they charge for tea! Tea is supposed to be free is pho restaurants, how else are we supposed to wash down the msg and who knows what else type of stuff they put in the soup :). Overall the place is decent, but I've tasted better."}
{"text":"I'm torn.  Really torn.  Is it 3 stars? No, but  is it 2 and a half? Is it 2?   I'm not sure and I'll let you make up your own mind after you read this.  Pho House is in a crappy strip mall in a crappy neighborhood.  When you walk inside, it looks a little crappy there too.  Now that you've read that and you're still reading, I'll tell you more.  The food is good.  It's not  REALLY good, but it's just slightly better than just OK.  I've had the Pho, and I've had the #1 ---BBQ'ed pork chops with an egg and rice and Vietnamese sausage.  The Pho is good. Close to excellent.  The bowls are not as huge as other places, but it's by no means a small bowl.  You won't be hungry.  The Spring Rolls don't have mint in them.  I'm sad, but the guy who takes the orders and serves the food says that he can't argue with the cook.  That's the way she makes them...they're also really chewy.  Not great.  The #1 was very disappointing.  The rice was old, the sausage may possibly have been rotten.  The egg--how can you screw up an egg?  was  OK.  The pork chops were cooked in a delicious seasoning, but they were really overcooked.  The drinks are horrendously over priced, but fresh and pretty tasty.  I don't recommend his Thai iced tea.  he makes it thicker than I like, but his strawberry smoothies are pretty bomb.   I've brought two different people with me the two times I've been there and both of them have told me that the food is great---note, they both had Pho and Spring Rolls. Personally,  I think it can't even touch Pho Than--HOWEVER, the guy who serves us is a total sweetheart, and Pho House is closer to me than Pho Than is.   Major kudos goes to the man who runs the front--I really need to learn his name next time.  He's obviously not ever been trained in restaurant work, but he's SUPER DUPER nice.    Next time I go (and there WILL INDEED be a next time)  I'm sticking to the Pho and I'll be happy.  Everything else is suspect. LOL!   Well,  I drove by, realizing that contrary to what I wrote in my review, I had NOT returned to Pho House, and they have closed.  I feel bad for them, but this was not a complete surprise."}
{"text":"Went back and ordered the red curry with chicken. Average at best. Should've stuck to the chicken pho - tried and true."}
{"text":"The Pho Ga(Chicken Soup) is really good. Its flavorful and good ingridients... Now I also tried the Vietnamese sub, the bread was good and crunchy but the BBQ Meat was \"Meh\" , nothing too crazy about it. The Spring rolls with shrimp with peanut dip sauce tasted bland as well, almost like it was imitation shrimp, very chewy so it whatevers and then the crunch roll with fish sauce was actually good too. I had a Banana smoothie to wash it down but was dissapointed, nothing too crazy, I wished they mixed it in with milk instead of water because it just tasted watered down. All in all I always come back have the Chicken pho"}
{"text":"I'm glad I can provide an update to my original review!  I went here for lunch -- on a day they are actually open -- and it was pretty empty at the height of lunch, which was a little concerning, to be honest.  We ordered the summer rolls and the watermelon juice, which were both very good.  They don't have seafood pho on the menu, which is always my go-to, so I ordered the chicken pho.  When they brought it out I could smell the broth, which smelled delicious.  I was pleased with my pho -- not the best I've had, but not the worst.  I could definitely go here again to get my pho fix.  And our server was really nice, so I'm sorry to hear that some other folks had bad service."}
{"text":"I have had Pho everywhere in the city of Toronto. And the places where they say they have the best.Pho House on Gerard just east of Broadview on the northside is the best I have ever had my name is Chef Brad McCrorie I have written for best selling cookbooks on soup. Susan Sampson gave me a full-page in the star they have made me the soup king of Canada.I really know what I'm talking about try itThis place is gotten so large they lost their quality doesn't taste the same it's not friendly anymore I'm not going back"}
{"text":"I read some of the \"bad customer service\" reviews on yelp; I'm not sure if it was because I was the only customer at that time or what, but our customer service wasn't bad.   They took my order, and delivered my food on time. The broth for the pho was so good! I felt like it was more flavorful than Da Vang's, but they didnt have tofu pho available. I had the chicken pho and it was really tasty! At previous experiences at other Vietnamese restaurants, their chicken pho was too fatty and oily. I thought their pho was perfection! Their spring rolls were pretty good although I would prefer more shrimp or larger shrimp in it. They also carry boba which I find pretty rare here in Arizona.   Overall, I thought Pho House was pretty good and will be coming again to try their bahn mi and other products on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a spring roll and the bbq pork #13. The spring roll was bland but the other dish was pretty good.  The decor was terribly ugly and the place was empty. The service was slow and not too good.   I guess if you want some noodles and beef call in for take out and you will be fine. For me it looked like they weren't trying to hard to serve the four people that were there and in no wa could be equipped to handle a rush if any ever came."}
