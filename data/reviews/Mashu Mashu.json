{"text":"My husband and I used to go to Mashu Mashu in Forest Hill Village and couldn't be happier to have them minutes away from our home. They brought one of the chefs from the first location so everything tastes just like the original. The small Chopped Salad is the best with a side of chicken and is more than enough for a lunch meal. Hummus and Babaganoush is the best ever. Can you tell I live this place!!!!! 

This location also has a great patio!"}
{"text":"Loved it. We went for dinner on a thursday night so it wasn't too busy. Great vibe. Generous proportions (with food and drinks!). Best falafel's i've ever had!! (and i've had many). The vegetarian options were wonderful. 

I actually forgot some leftovers there that they packed up for me to take home, and I wanted to cry, haha."}
{"text":"We always got takeout from here at my fellowship meetings. It's quick and easy to assemble and it appeals to pretty much everyone regardless of dietary restrictions. Good for meetings and for events."}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma and it made me feel really sick. The meat tasted off and my stomach was upset as if I had got food poisoning. The service was really great, though, and the portion sizes were generous. However, I will likely not be returning anytime soon."}
