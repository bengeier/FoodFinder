{"text":"In my opinion, the best atmosphere to smoke sheesha in. I like the traditional seating, and the fact that they dont serve alcahol. Its a nice alternative to a pub or bar. The reason why I give it a three is that the food is very mediocre and noticbly more so since the newish ownership change. It seemed more disorganized, and the service lacking. But, again, good for sheesha and tea."}
{"text":"This is the best sheesha place in town. Has great service, and fantastic food! My recommendation is the all meat pizza. Best in the city, in a authentic middle eastern environment!"}
{"text":"Great Shisha, food, and service."}
{"text":"Café Med has an authentic feel to it and the sheesha always tastes great -never stale or bitter. They fill ever table so you may end up sitting next to people that you have never met before but it doesn't detract anything from the experience and, in fact, if you are of a gregarious nature may add to it (although on a busy Friday night it can get a bit claustrophobic with just a few too many elbows and not enough table room for them all). Unfortunately the service often leaves something to be desired, it's slow and not incredibly friendly. The location is great for starting off a night on the town though with great bars and pubs only walking distance away."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sheesha bar in Calgary. The food is amazing, drinks are refreshing, sheesha is perfect and the staff is friendly.

I have been to many sheesha bars in Calgary, but this is by far the best. I go so often all the staff know me and know my usual order and I have it within minutes! Some people complain about the service here, but you just have to know what to do. If they don't come around to take your order right away, just get up, walk over to them and ask them what you would like. It's so simple. People have become lazy over the years and have to be spoon fed everything. The servers are busier than the regular servers at a restaurant. They are bartenders, servers, hosts, hookah prepares, coal lighters and cashiers. To get the best service stop Them as they walk by or walk up to them. Everyone else in the bar is doing it, you should too.

The best food item in my opinion is the beef/chicken Shwarma Plate. It is delicious, and every time I order it the table next to me ends up ordering it as well. The Mango Smoothie is one of their best drinks they have as well as the Moroccan Tea. 

As far as Sheesha goes, I order Sweet Melon-Orange-Mint. Very good. Peach-Mango tastes like Skittles, and White Grape-Strawberry is always a favorite.

The only negatives about Cafe Med is it gets very busy quickly on most nights, and the seating arrangement is sometimes lacking. But those things can be easily overlooked in my books. Nothing can be perfect, and if Cafe Med was perfect I would probably have never left! I love this place."}
{"text":"Nice how they keep adding more tobacco to your pipe. Good ambience and friendly staff. That's probably what keeps the place always full. Recommended"}
{"text":"Sometimes after a long night at the bar I like to hit up a bar; specifically Cafe Med. 

While most people clamor for a slice of greasy pizza in the wee hours I clamor for a seat in the smokiest, we've-got-things-like-mint-melon-on-the-menu, sheesha bar I can find a bench at.

Cafe Med has a nice selection of flavored sheesha that can make even the most picky of smokers believe they were inhaling a fruit salad. The service in this tiny spot is nice, the pipes come out quick, they don't charge for extra coals, and for you pizza-at-2AM lovers, Cafe Med boasts an excellent deep-dish style pizza oozing with cheese etcetera.

The benches are a tad on the uncomfortable side - more pillows would be nice - and, although the sheesha comes out nice and fast, the food takes some time. If it's after midnight, I am surprised if you're not dozing by the time your food comes out. 

Decorated thematically, Cafe Med looks like it should be something out of Laurence of Arabia. But when those ugly lights come on, sharply at 1:50 AM, you'll see a warn out place filled with old smoke, and the magic is gone.

Even with it's imperfections Cafe Med still boasts yummy flavored sheesha, greasy pizza and brightly colored glass pipes snaked with hooka hoses; making this little sheesha bar an amiable post-party hangout where you can practice you're smoke rings like you're that caterpillar from Alice and Wonderland.

{"text":"I have been studying cafe Med for about 8 years now. My extensive research was all for the sake of eventually writing this review.
I have more than likely spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours here. I love the atmosphere, cool and relaxed although it can get a bit noisy on weekends. The sheesha has certainly improved in quality over the years and particularly in the last few months since the cafe has undertaken new management . The pizza is the best in the city and the Arabic coffee is a perfect accoutrement to a nice pipe and some great conversations."}
{"text":"Fantastic hummus, great shisha, some good specials from day to day. Always packed with beautiful young women. You have to make yourself known if you want service though. don't be shy. Good Arabic style coffee."}
{"text":"At first glance if you're not looking for Cafe Med you might miss it. Also it is best not to confuse this establishment with Cafe Medina across the street. Situated on 1st Street SW in between 10th and 11th Avenue. The general area is a little sketchy but I think it adds character to the experience itself.

Quick Tip: Twist the door handle to enter or you might find yourself standing there like a fool for a few minutes until you figure that out.

I haven't been to Cafe Med in a really long time actually so I thought it was a perfect excuse to visit and see what experiences I will have this time around with the Yelp crew.

Cafe Med has a very traditional interior with its basically reddish color scheme. Low benches and seats with pillows randomly placed everywhere. There is one or two tv's if thats your ting. One thing I could do without is the extremely loud music, it was so loud at times I thought I might be at some concert, front row, totally rocking out - you know? Or perhaps in an extreme belly dancing class who knows.

I ordered a Peach Italian Soda like I always do, it is actually quite delicious! You just need to remember to really mix up the syrup or you will have espresso shots of syrup each time you sip.

For food, I ordered the BBQ Schwarma Pizza which I thought was delicious. I would like to try out all the different kinds. I like the crust and how the pizza is made as well. I did feel guilty eating it like Tiffany and Sarah Louise were secretly judging me (probably were, just kidding, care bear stare!)

We also ordered two Sheesha pipes as well, can't recall which flavors but I did enjoy them both and I thought it was cool that servers came around with fresh coals all the time. I hate changing the coals myself, feel like I'm gonna cause some kinda disturbance.

Lastly, my one suggestion for Cafe Med is pay better attention to their patrons. My friends are regulars there, I know what's up with everything and it doesn't matter who you are the level of service should be the same. Perhaps I'm spoiled with people always tending to me. Really though, when people pay separately you should keep track or else Angelo would have paid for a pipe that didn't exist. Also it would be fantastic to remember to bring back teapots with more hot water if you said you would take away them to replenish them. Aside from that I don't mind asking them again for people either. I want my friends to have a good experience as well.

Will be back of course!"}
{"text":"I've been to Café Med a handful of times over the last few years. Great place to unwind and catch up with friends, that is, if you don't mind the loud music, and long wait times for food and drinks. 

The wait time for a pipe isn't long at all, and the servers coming around with fresh coals are friendly and prompt. Once you can get the plastic mouth protector over the pipe opening (amidst all the \"is it in yet?\" jokes), that is. The mango mint flavor isn't bad. When I was a smoker, I hated the taste of menthol cigarettes, but in mango-y sheesha form; it's pleasantly soothing. What I did hate the taste of? The falafel. Awful falafel. They're the nasty ones from Superstore and as much as I've been conditioned to never waste food, choking them down was impossible. They were that bad. Everything else on the plate was really good though (and pretty!), and I cleaned off as much of it as I could.

Next time, I'll have to try the coffee."}
{"text":"Best hummus in the city ... it is so creamy and awesome, I wish I knew how they did it! Great Mediterranean appetizers overall.

I love baba ganoush and and labneh, both of which are good here so I order them often.

The bruschetta is spicy but also very tasty. On occasion their tomatoes are too mushy/old so I hope they will pay attention to this more in the future and not serve them like this, or only serve them when they are in season. 

Love the dressing on their Greek salad. 

Overall good quality food."}
{"text":"Since I'm in Calgary only during the summer, this is definitely one of my spots to hit up to get my daily dosage of hookah. 

But being from San Diego and having around 10 hookah bars to choose from, this place would definitely not go on my top 10, but it'll do for the time I stay in Calgary. 

The food is good, service is always excellent and quite prompt, just the hookahs are not so great the tobacco is decent and the coals are good, but the consistency is very light smoke. For the amateur hookah smoker I highly recommend this place, but be sure to dress light in the summer time because there is no AC available."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times during my hipster era (if there ever was such a thing), when hookah smoking took presidence over mutual fund investing.  Europe's crashing in a big ball of fire and any money I try to put away seems to disappear into thin air. Time to go back to Sheesha smoking and here to hoping they put something a little \"special\" in there.

Aside from this Cafe Med is where I've had my first Sheesha experience. They were really friendly and made the experience quite fun, where most places just shove the hot pipe contraption in front of your face and leave you to figure out what to do with the strange hose hovering in front of you.

They offer a myriad of herbal shisha flavours (herbal only because Calgary bylaws restrict the use of tobacco) but what I loved about Cafe Med is their menu.

They offer the BEST garlic cheese pizza in the city. Period. I've had it several times over the years and its been consistently delicious. They have great tea/coffee selections and I highly recommend the Egyptian hot tea. My friend's have had their falafels and dips and also raved about it.

Cafe Med has a great cozy setting that makes for a great place to stealaway into during the day. I remember coming here during the day when I participated in the 3 day novel because I was going insane locked away for 48 hours in my room and managed to work up the mental momentum to go the stretch into finishing my contest entry.

{"text":"The best Shisha bar in the city! The food is great, staff friendly and atmosphere amazing. Worth a trip!

At first I did not know what Shisha was and was worried I would be coughing and hating it. It is kind of smoke, but mostly water vapor and herb stuff. White Grape & Watermelon or Strawberry are the lightest flavors and good for a first timer. Relax there, look around, listen to the music and take in the atmosphere. Meet new friends, or bring your friends for a killer party.

Talk to Arraf, he will get you hooked up."}
{"text":"I'm not really a sheesha guy.  In fact, I don't even know what it is but I see everyone else puffing on it when I come here for lunch.  So, I guess it must be good here if you like that sort of thing.
I like food.  The pizza is great.  I've tried a couple kinds and they are always good.  I think it's the crust.
Typically I order either the Hot or Cold Mezza to start and sometimes both.  These are big enough for a meal so plan on sharing or don't order a meal.
The Med Salad is always fresh and has a real tangy dressing.  Kind of a vinaigrette and it goes great with the chicken and donair meat in the salad.
If your in the area, you should try this place."}
{"text":"My buddies and me are quite the sheesha fiends. And why not? Sheesha is a great way to relax with friends and in the pleasurable company of other people but not in one of Calgary's many bars. And Café Med is the first sheesha bar I went to, oh so many years ago. It is THE classic on the Calgary sheesha scene.

They definitely have some of the best sheesha and the best ambiance in Calgary. Velvet curtains open into a smoke-filled room covered in tapestries and blasting middle easten-style music. The tables are all small benches around larger tables that can sit anywhere from two to twelve. When it is busy (Friday-Sunday), it's not unusual to be sharing a table with one or more groups! Service varies significantly depending on how busy the night is, which can be unfortunate.

Once you are seated (which can take a while - service is touch and go here), they'll bring you a menu full of tasty Mediterranean treats - fatoosh and pizza and hummus and falafel and everything in between. I really love cheese, so I'm partial to the pita mozzarella which is like pita and mozza and cheese and deliciously edible. FYI - the food is quite good, but can take a while to get to your table. Also, you have a truly great selection of teas and non-alcoholic beverages. The Moroccan Mint is to die for. Then you can order one of over twenty different flavours of sheesha, sit back and blow smoke rings. My faves - White Grape and Cherry Bomb. Perfect place for a chill night."}
{"text":"Dirty. Disgusting. Gross. That pretty much sums up what you get here. Worst Mediterranean food we've ever had. Do yourself a favor and dont go here."}
{"text":"Walking into this establishment is like walking into Aladdin's crib.  We are talking dim lighting, flowing brocade and velvet and Middle Eastern music pulsating in the background.  Cafe Med had many tables filled today, many enjoying their shisha, others in conversation or playing backgammon.

This is definitely a great Middle Eastern atmosphere with lower tables and chairs so you can really get down and relax.  

Food or drink must be bought when using the hookah but their menu offers many choices so it's worth the visit.  The hookah is a single or multi-stemmed instrument for smoking tobacco in which the smoke is cooled and filtered by passing through water. At CM you have 20 choices to pick from and the air was filled with the aroma of different scents but it set a pleasant atmosphere.

I am not a shisha gal but I can definitely attest to the deliciousness of the garlic pizza here; nice and crispy, a good portion and all that garlic goodness that makes me not even notice the steamed vapour scents.

The staff is friendly here but the service does take its time which is appropriate as this does go with the territory of laying back and enjoying your smoke."}
{"text":"It's like I inhaled a piece of Bubblicious Watermelon. Yep, inhaled-it was in smoke form... with no tobacco. That works just fine for me, I'm not sure I could've had much more than a puff or two of it otherwise. 

It was my first sheesha experience. I was also the first one there. Cafe Med was busy and I was too afraid to go in by myself. Thank the good Yelp gods for Sarah Louise! She saved me from looking like a creep peeking in the windows for too long. 

The folks at Cafe Med are friendly people. Our server talked us into some Moroccan Madness (tea) while we waited for the rest of our peeps to arrive. We also snacked on some red pepper hummus and rolled up grape vine leaves (if you've never had them, they're comparable to cabbage rolls in concept... just a different flavour to them). You might also want to try the garlic pizza. 

As far as sheesha bars go, I have nothing else to compare this one to! So it's got three stars in my books. Mostly because the guy serving our table offered to fill our tea pots up with more hot water, took the pots away and didn't return with them until we inquired about them again. And also because, even though it's a spot to come smoke things, there were times the haze built up enough to burn my eyes for a moment or two. 

At any rate, the food was pretty cheap, the pipes were just over $10 each and they kept bringing new coals around. From what I gathered, not dropping ashes into the pipe is a bit of an art that Cafe Med has mastered. Overall, a positive experience!"}
{"text":"I think it is quite authentic, that is good and bad.
The service is bad compared to Western standards and the patrons tend to be kind of boisterous, but I think this ends up adding to the charm."}
{"text":"I cannot really speak to the sheesha at this particular esablishment, because I am just getting over a cold and did not join the rest of my party in enjoying the couple pipes we had going around. Surely, I probably would not have enjoyed them anyways, because I hate everything. 
When I found out our mix tape exchange would be at Cafe Med, I kind of grooooaned a little bit. I have never liked sheesha bars. It isn't even because I rarely smoke sheesha, but because I have always received notoriously poor service in any sheesha establishment I've ever visited. 
We sat at our table for probably ten minutes or so before anyone bothered to throw some menus our way, but at least the server was pretty nice. This was also excuseable because it was busy. 
I am so stoked for those who enjoy the pizza so much at Cafe Med. I have heard great things, and Vangelo's pizzas looked fantastic. However, as a vegan I do not partake in pizza or fun. Therefore, I instead shared a plate of red pepper hummus, as well as grape vine leaves with Wendy. The grape vine leaves were tasty, but hideously wrapped, served up on a plate that was very 80s-deco-shredded-lettuce-and-canned-banana-pepper-tacky. Also, the hummus was literally served on a plate, which for some reason really creeped me out. Grumpy Sarah Louise. 
The server was actually really friendly, reccomending the Moroccan Madness loose leaf tea as his favourite. However, when he offered us second steepings, he never ever came back with our pots and half of Vangelo had to come to the rescue and demand new ones. 
Also, if you want to watch frighteningly spray tanned couples in sports jerseys bicker loudly and publicly a la a low budget episode of Jersey Shore, this is the place to be. Gross. Of course, this wasn't as distracting as the obnoxiously loud, awful music playing. 
I wanted to like Cafe Med, but I still don't think sheesha bars are my things."}
{"text":"I went here immediately after the last Yelp Elite event for some pizza, and obviously, sheesha. Let me start by saying that I've never been here before, and I had no idea they did not serve alcohol. So first thing, I ordered a drink, much to the embarrassment of my party. Yeah, yeah.

Also, a homeless woman went to the washroom across the street from where we were sitting. Oh the Beltline.

Anyway, I sort of like sheesha. I think flavoured tobacco actually tastes pretty gross, so I asked my friends if we could order the mint, which we did. It was pretty good, certainly adds to the atmosphere of the place. The nice couches, the pillows, it's all a pretty good place to relax. I must say, I enjoyed myself.

On to the food, we ordered some falafel, a pizza, and, I think, a hummus dish. It was all great. Pretty straight-forward, but delicious. The pizza was priced very competitively, and had a lot of toppings on it. 

The service is pretty poor, but that's just part of the scene, I think."}
{"text":"A laid-back and usually mellow atmosphere where my friends and I used to visit quite often to sit back and chat, enjoy some sheesha and their tasty appetizers as late-night snacks. I understand they have new management; it would be interesting to see how the quality has changed accordingly."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Med so many times its crazy. Lately I have been going there and the service has been slow and when asked when I went up to pay \"how was it?\" I told the truth, \"Food is great, but the service wasn't good again\". I went to Cafe Med last night and was approached by the server and he asked me why I came there, I told him I love the food, thought he was joking around, turns out that he was trying to tell me to go to another place. He told me that there is Medina right over there and to walk on over and go. He said you complained last time why come back?  I was in shock over this. I went to the manager on site, and was told that he was sorry and that he shouldn't talk like that and just left it at that. He did not ask the employee to apologize or he him self did not even check up on us the rest of the night. Instead of ordering food , i just had the shisha and left. I can not believe how this establishment has decreased in its credibility in over the  years. I have been going their since they first opened. Sad, just sad. When you hire people with no customer service skills and place them in a setting where the actually have to interact with customers, its scary!  Remember people this is my experience and I have a right to my opinion."}
{"text":"Great environment. great place if you want to relax. Music is good. Always packed with people. The place is affordable. I would reccoment the pizza. The hookah flavors are great. The staff is friendly. 
Only downfall is that is place small and is very popular, sometimes the wait times for a table can be long."}
{"text":"I am visiting Calgary and this has become my new hang out spot. The hookah is of excellent quality and very affordable. The flavors available are great. The ambiance of is very nice and relaxing. At night they play music and it is always of great taste. Another fantastic thing is the food. We ordered a pizza and it was beyond amazing. The crust was perfect and the cheese and the toppings. It was such a great pizza that we have to definitely get it again before I leave. This was a top 5 must go to place for me while visiting."}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of shisha, but when my friends want to go this is the place to go.  It's always a good time no matter who you're with or when you go.  

They have so many different flavours of shisha to choose from and each is delicious in their own way.  I prefer the fruity flavours to the chocolate or coffee ones though... I find them a little more refreshing.

Not only do they have great, friendly service, but they even offer a crash course for all the beginners that go there.  It's not like it's hard though.  You light the charcoal, and suck on the hose... pretty self-explanatory.  Don't worry all you first-timers, everything that goes on inside this place is completely legal.

They also have a wide selection of meals and appetizers to choose from, but I don't usually go for it.  Like I said, I don't really care for the shisha so I don't feel the need to buy the food in the joint.  My philosophy on shisha is, it's not giving me my nicotine fix so what's the point?

I definitely understand why other people like to chill in this place though.  That's exactly what you do... chill.  It's a nice atmosphere with cool people."}
