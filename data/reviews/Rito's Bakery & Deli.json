{"text":"Excellent bakery - this place was hopping over the holidays. We got tons of Christmas cookies and nut bread. Nice people - also they have a nice selection of deli foods"}
{"text":"They have a nice display and everything looks delicious, however it doesn't taste that good. I had a cassata cake and it wasn't fresh. The homemade bread is probably the best thing they have going for them. Also during both of my visits the workers were arguing with each other which made it awkward. Sometimes it seems like you are bothering them when they are helping you."}
{"text":"Rito's made the wedding cake for my wedding day. It tasted good, but they spelled my husband's name wrong on the two mini heart cakes that sat in front of the larger cake.  His name is \"Jeffrey\" and they spelled it \"Jeffery\".  I would not use them again for big events like a wedding because I feel like this is a big deal and they are not detail oriented. For smaller events, I would buy their pastries, but would find someone more detailed for major life events."}
{"text":"They have the best olives in town as well as their date and nut cake.  Love this place!  They are always helpful on the telephone or in the store.  So glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Gee, the cookies and cakes look gorgeous, but you just don't know what is fresh. We had a tasty Chinese cookie, but the brownie was dry--I'm not sure how old it was, but it was certainly not baked that day. And the calzones are strange... ham, salami, pepperoni in this case do not go with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Everything looks great! But like some other reviewers said it seems like some of the pastries are definitely not made today.Even thought I try to support small businesses whenever possible  I do not think I would go back."}
{"text":"Used Rito's for a family party. Deli tray was excellent! The gigantic cannoli filled with cannolis was a favorite. The cake was fresh and decorated to perfection. There was not a crumb leftover. Can't wait for the next family party!"}
{"text":"A recent stop at ritos a month ago says a lot. Food is far better than years ago and deserves a higher rating.   7/10"}
{"text":"Good bakery.  Bakeries like this a getting harder to find.  Can be busy.  Deli selection and packaged foods good.  Bakery items could be better and can be pricey.  Bread a good value"}
{"text":"Loved the baked goods we sampled at the home and garden show '17 . Planning a trip to  Italy this Fall but how wonderful we can drive 25 minutes and experience these homemade trips in our hometown. The eclair with Bavarian cream was phenomenal and took me back yo my childhood  it confirmed this is my favorite . The cannoli was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today.  I stopped in the St. Patricks Day corned beef dinner special.  They didn't include the coleslaw as advertised.  Also the meal was completely cold.  I live literally a few blocks away.  So it wasn't because it took awhile to get home with it.  I called Ritos to ask about the missing coleslaw and she said they ran out.  Funny how they didn't mention that when I purchased the meal.  They also didn't offer a replacement.  Also when I mentioned the food was completely cold she said that the meals had been in the cooler and \"you can just warm it up\".    After a long days work, warming up a meal is not what I had in mind or I would have cooked it on my own.  Also to not offer something for the missing coleslaw is just disappointing at best.  I don't think I will be going here anymore.  Between skyrocketing prices and sub par offerings, I think not."}
{"text":"I stoped with my Grandma  the other day. She had a lemon Doughnut she said it was absolutely delicious I had my first cannoli it was very good. I wish they had cupcakes because I really want to try their cake. If I'm in this area again I will definitely stop by. Wish things were a little cheaper but it was very good ."}
{"text":"Bought a couple dozen Ponschkis for Fat Tuesday, everyone LOVED them at the office. Absolutely no complaints!!!!"}
{"text":"The food looks delicious and tasty...but tasty it is not. I don't know how this place is able to display thier food so well that it looks excellent but the actual flavor can range from cardboard to so-so.   When this place first opened, it wasn't that bad. Their bakery treats like the cookies and brownies were freshly cooked and worth the drive. However, it seems that Rito's got lazy and decided to stop really caring about thier customers or thier business. Maybe their will be a turn around...but this raunchy bistro is reaching its end."}
{"text":"Very rude service. Because of this, I will not be returning. I cannot speak on the quality of the food, but a smile can go a long way Rito's. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"I get their cookies and pastries which are yummy.   I've also bought their frozen pizza dough which is a treat!  Be careful though don't drop it on your foot it's solid!"}
{"text":"Over ten years ago I got a cassata cake for my graduation party. It was very good but I'm sure recipes have changed since then. I've never been inside the Ritos located here in Brunswick but I have been to the one in Parma and they told me that Brunswick Rito's makes the cakes and delivers them to Parma so that's why I am reviewing the one in Brunswick. I have a funny story. I ordered a cake for my sister in laws baby shower. The cake was a pregnant belly and boobs obviously covered up by a shirt. The cake looked great and tasted good but I realized as soon as I picked it up that they added a neck and just a little of the upper chest (the picture I sent them didn't have a neck but no big deal) in which they made the skin Caucasian. I thought to myself, \"I ordered over the phone so how do they know she or I was not black or Hispanic?\" Lol its funny but if I was not Caucasian it would definitely NOT have been funny. Anyone could have not thought to ask that when ordering but when making the cake the baker should have stopped and had someone put in a phone call to see. Someone would be more offended by making the wrong race cake than just double checking their race so the cake is to their liking. I've owned a home bakery for two years now and I have learned from this experience to always ask lol and no one has ever been offended only appreciative. The only pastry I've had from them are their cannoli's and baklava which are both amazing! Oh and I ordered a zebra sheet cake three years ago and it was decorated as I asked and tasted good too. I will add a picture to Yelp."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of Italian treats.  Cookies, angel wings, fresh bread, cakes and deli meats galore.  Rito's is the best Italian bakery in town, hands down."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try it on a tip about  the canolis. Called ahead to order.  Was told there were only 6 pieces of pizza left so I order 2 to be hot when I arrived. They were cold in a bag. She heated them up in a microwave. Huh? Tried a canoli. Filling  already contains chocolate, so you had better not be allergic. Asked about the pie filling and was told they scoop it out of a bucket. Asked for directions to the freeway and they had no idea. Sent in 2 emails to hopefully resolve the problem, but I never received a reply. What a sham!"}
{"text":"It's billed as a bakery and I go there and don't buy bakery items. We'll proceed from there.   I like their hot pepper salad, choices of Italian cold cuts (eg hot Sopressata) and some jarred sauces (eg their caponata). A few cookies or canolli here and there were typical fare, not great but acceptable.   The folks have always been friendly. Today I got there right after closing and she unlocked the door to let me in. Very nice. While checking out I saw her head swinging to the Louie Prima song. \"Can't resist?\" \"Nope and I listen all day!\" My sort of folks."}
{"text":"Cakes are absoloutely delicious!  They served one at a function I attended, and everyone was raving about it."}
{"text":"I am 50 years old.  I grew up eating Rito's fresh baked Italian bread.  I grew up in West Park (Cleveland) and my grandmother lived in Parma Hts.  She would come down West 130th street a couple times a week and always get a load of their bread (from the original West 130th street store).  NOBODY makes bread like Rito's!!!  Soooo soft when it is fresh baked, and add some Country Crock butter....   MMMMM   She would also order a sheet pizza every Christmas.   I am not one for cold pizza.  I like it right out of the oven, but Rito's pizza is AWESOME cold!!  Taste has not changed after all these years.  Sadly, Gram is gone, but I can eat Rito's bread and pizza and it takes me back to my childhood."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst bakery that I have ever tasted. If I could give Rito's 0 stars I would. I have tried numerous items including cannoli, cookies, cake, and their highly touted pizza. I found everything to be bland. The cold pizza was absolutely disgusting. Shockingly enough it seems like some people do like this place so I encourage everyone to try it and formulate your opinion."}
