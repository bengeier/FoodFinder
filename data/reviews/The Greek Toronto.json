{"text":"Honestly - my first review on yelp but I'm had to. Just tried this place out and the portion was so small I  called to double check that they hadn't made a mistake. On top of that the food wasn't cheap and was sub par at best. With so many great places surrounding them and the Danforth a subway ride away, I suggest eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed. The pitas are small, the meat is under seasoned, low on tzatziki, and overall low on flavour. To top it off, I wouldn't consider it cheap...   Hopefully these guys get their act together, since they just opened up. I feel a little salt and seasoning would go a long way. But if not, as Marcus mentioned, Its All Grk is pretty close and is awesome.  As an aside, I asked the girl taking orders about what pita she thought was good, and she responded she hadn't eaten any of them because 'she had an allergy to pita'. Worst hire for a pita joint, ever."}
{"text":"This place is an insult to greeks in toronto. The food is very low quality, nothing is authentic about the quality or taste. The pita bread is straight out of what you purchase at no frills, the salad is bagged salad.... the feta cheese is garbage.  Sorry to hate on the place, but the only thing this place did right is with their branding. Other than that, I tried it and will never waste my time or money there again.  Instead, I've been to Its All Grk and they haven't let me down yet.  Good luck to \"The Greek\" toronto, i doubt it will last. Just like \"The Greek Spot\" that opened in roncesvalles and lasted 8 months serving similar garbage quality good."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place - especially since I live and work in the area.  But after giving it three tries, I give up.  In every instance I ordered the Greek village salad with a chicken skewer.  And each time there was something off.  Either the chicken was half a portion or dry - or the salad was half rotten, or not even a village salad.  Don't get me started on the rudeness of the young woman at the cash.  For $12, could you please, please get a basic salad and grilled chicken done right?  And for the love of Pete, nix that brown gloopy salad dressing!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most underwhelming food experiences I've had in a while. Service was extremely slow and careless. The person on cash and those cooking were moving so slow and so passionless. The food itself was boring. Everything was very run of the mill and small. I would definitely not recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by today looking for a fast healthy lunch.  The menu looked fresh and reasonable so I popped in.   Unfortunately the food did not match the pretty decor.   I ordered the greek salad with chicken and asked that my feta be replaced with fried halloumi. I was told that I would be charged extra for the substitution but that I would be given a 'generous' portion in my salad.  In the end ,between adding the chicken and halloumi, my $7.95 salad turned into a $20 one!   My $20 salad was horrible. The chicken was so so so so so so so dry and my 'generous' portion of 'fried' halloumi was neither generous nor fried.   For $20 I expected a lot more than the VERY basic salad I received. Save your money--and go to the burger place next door."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out on my way home and since I was attempting to be healthy, I ordered a Greek salad and chicken skewer.  Both were good but in my opinion, overpriced.  I think I paid just over $12. The salad was fresh, good portion size and came with a nice lemon wedge.  The chicken skewer (1 skewer with maybe 3 small pieces of chicken) was served with a couple of pieces of pita.  Perhaps I would have been more fulfilled and happy with what I paid for if I had gotten the fried haloumi sticks instead of iceberg lettuce and a few pieces of chicken which I could have made at home for a fraction of the cost.  Don't get me wrong though, I don't think either were spectacular by any means but not bad.  I would return but to try the unhealthier menu options and save my healthy eating for home made meals."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for lunch and the place was empty! At first we thought the restaurant was closed but it was in fact opened, just no customers inside. The lady at cash was very friendly and processed our transaction quickly. The place was pretty clean, fresh designs, and VERY quiet. No music, no voices, only the few odd sounds in the kitchen.   I ordered the Greek Poutine. It was served in a gigantic bowl, much too big for one person to consume. At least I couldn't do it. I had to enlist the help of my husband to eat some of the poutine but even then we still had some left over. The poutine was good - not the best poutine I've ever had - but good over all. It consisted of french fries, meat, tzatziki, feta, and an olive. The fries were tasty. Crispy. Fresh. Nicely salted. I found the meat needed a little bit more flavouring but it was still ok. It was a pretty decent meal over all and I very much enjoyed it. Not sure if the take out portion is any different than eat in sizes but when you eat in the poutine portion is massive and definitely good for sharing. Priced at $7-$8 this poutine really isn't so bad with what you get.  Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant and I would visit again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came in here on a relatively busy Friday night and partly due to that, there wasn't speedy service (I think I waited ~5 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get my pork pita). The pork pita smelled great but it was fairly small and the sauce they used was watery. In addition, the pork wasn't tender and juicy but dry and a bit chewy for my liking.  Wasn't really impressed with it so I most likely won't be returning but it's better than a hot dog or McDonalds."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and I've enjoyed both orders. The greek poutine is a must for all who are trying it for the first time. Great addition to the hood."}
{"text":"I have been to The Greek twice. I always think it's best to try a spot more than once to get a good idea about what it's all about. (Especially if your first time wasn't the greatest)  I had a chicken pita with fries and a side salad. The Chicken pita was drenched in tzatziki and was rather tasteless. The fries had a nice seasoning, but cold. Since it was a take out I can only assume that they were given to me hot but ended up cold by the time I ate them (even though it was about a 5 minute time lapse). The salad is exactly what you expect, chopped up tomato and cucumber with feta and olives. I would have liked to see more olives, there were only 2.   The second time I went to The Greek, it was again for take out. I ordered the chicken pita once again just to see if there would  be a difference. It was much skinnier than the first one, not sure if it was just under-stuffed, or if the first time it was over-stuffed. It tasted much better, more flavor, and was enjoyable! I am hoping the next time I visit the pita will be fuller though.   Overall, you get what you pay for. It's a $7 pita, cheap and cheerful. You cant expect gourmet for this price but if they stick with making a decent sized pita you will have a great lunch!"}
