{"text":"I went in there tonight. As i was prepared to order my food, the owners son started saying some racist shit. He then charged me for the food I didnt eat when I left the place because I left when he made racist comments."}
{"text":"Price ok, location very good but they have two other corned beef shops  within a stones throw and are clearly 3rd best in that group. Open very late is a plus but all the sandwiches should be sliced fresh which mine certainly was not. Dry and small compared to Corkys and Ontario which is hard to understand. How you serve up a lessor product and expect to get repeat business is a complete mystery in that area."}
{"text":"Jake's has great Corned beef sandwiches. We split one, because it was so large. We went after the fourth of July fireworks show. We were lucky, because we had bought the last of the cb, and it was still delicious! Recommended!"}
{"text":"The location is great just right across from the tower center and the casino. I stop in there for a quick meal before hopping on a train to the airport. I ordered corned beef on rye. The sandwich was a decent size for about 10 bucks, it might be a tad on a pricey side. The corned beef was really good and rye bread was ok too. Not only was it satisfied my craving, it was nice and flavorful as well."}
{"text":"Although I'm sure the other food is great, I was dissatisfied with the falafel. I came here because it was open late and the reviews were good, but the falafel was just the worst. Not the vegetables, tatziki sauce, or the pita bread, those were just fine. It was just the falafel. The texture, flavor, and moisture of the food were all wrong.  The texture: Crumply, yet chunky.   The flavor: Far too salty. Almost overwhelming  The moisture: None... It was insanely dry. Far too dry.  I just ate the sandwich as a veggie wrap.   If you go here looking for good falafel, you have gone to the wrong place."}
{"text":"Left the casino at 2:30, walked across the street to jakes. Service was awesome, met jakes son, food was better than expected! Would definitely go back! A+"}
{"text":"HOLY COW, I love this place.  The staff was friendly and funny and the prices aren't bad at all.  We stopped in here before our New Year celebrations and had probably the best reuben I have ever tasted. I'm kind of picky when it comes to any meat, and I've often been disappointed by corned beef, but this was absolutely stellar! Tons of prefect corned beef piled on the sandwich did make it a little difficult to eat, but I'll definitely take a messy and tasty sandwich any day. Who cares if the contents fall out onto the paper? That's what fingers are for! Just lean over the paper it was wrapped in, protect your lap with a napkin and chow down.   I can't wait until I have an excuse to go downtown and get another one of these sandwiches. Wow...my mouth is watering right now."}
{"text":"Run-of-the mill sandwich place, nothing spectacular or revelatory by any stretch, but not horrible either.  I took my chances with the pastrami, and while it did give me mild indigestion and the accompanying pickle spear was bland, it was alright.  I'd say it could've benefited from more pastrami, but no, not really.  Onion maybe, but no more pastrami.  It was very greasy and rather meh.  The price was right though, and bland as it was, it was still a free pickle.  A random pigeon stopped by while my brother and I were eating and took a look around - luckily he stayed on his side of the counter.    If I lived in Cleveland and worked downtown, I'd probably hit this place up for lunch and get something other than the pastrami, but it's not worth going out of the way for it."}
{"text":"I stopped by here without any planning, I was just hungry. I was pleasantly surprised with superb service and food. I had a spinach calzone, which was well priced at just $3. It is conveniently located at the center of downtown Cleveland and it is pretty much on the way to anything. The Lebanese owner was kind and helpful as I made my selection and I would definitely visit again to try some of the unique dishes in this cornerstone cafe."}
{"text":"Having to get lunch on the fly one day and not wanting to get the traditional fast food, we opted for Jake's.  A short walk from where we were staying made it that much better.  Kind of a mix of a quick sandwich shop and a convenience store type of setup.  The menu offers a lot of different sandwiches, so you can take your time to look over the menu, which I suggest you do.  The original sandwich I wanted wasn't available due to not having bacon, so it was a good call to look over the entire menu.  Since there was no bacon, I went with a grilled cheese.  I know what you are thinking, why a grilled cheese?  Well, I wanted to be a kid that day...not really.  I wanted quick and I knew this wouldn't take long to make.  When I ordered this I thought it was going to be a traditional one tier grilled cheese.  I was wrong, it came out kind of like a triple decker sandwich.  I had picked up a bag of chips and a water to go with it and it came to something like $8, not bad for a quick lunch.  Staff were polite and busy.  We ate in house at the little counter near the window.  Makes for some good people watching in this busy area downtown."}
{"text":"Tasty!! I got the hot corned beef sandwich on this 55 degree day and it really hit the spot. The rye bread was soft and delicious, and they piled on the meat and the sauerkraut. Everyone working there was super friendly. I wish the counter was a little larger or they had a seating area, but my belly was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich for the money in Cleveland, way better than the one I had at Mabel's for $6.00 more, plus better service.  The owner treated everyone with great respect."}
{"text":"Jakes is everything you want in a late night deli:  1) 24/7 gruff, funny and efficient service 2) colorful drunk characters 3) they won't try to swindle you 4) grungy but in that cool rock star sort of way, not the homeless guy on the corner way 5) gyros and corned beef, need I say more?  Seriously, next time you find yourself in public square with a late night craving, treat yoself"}
{"text":"I have always walked past this place because of its location relative to Tower City and the usual business crowd in there at lunch time... I figured this place would serve up average sandwiches at above average prices. Boy was I wrong! I was first amazed at how reasonable the prices were - an average sandwich is about $5.50. For the price, these sandwiches weren't hulking, but there was a lot of meat to deal with. One will easily fill you up. A friend ordered a gyro and we have both never seen one so big before. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"The art of sandwich craft. It really is an art; the ability to properly build a sandwich so that it's contents don't fall out the back (or worse, out the front, on your clothes) is taken for granted. The folks at Jake's do not have this gift.  I got a \"smoked\" turkey sandwich on wheat with 1000 Island. The \"smoked\" turkey was your run of the mill, cheap deli turkey -but they do give you a lot of thick slices. They were out of wheat so I got Italian - small, thin slices of Italian. So we have thin, small slices of Italian, smothered in 100 Island on both slices, then lettuce and the turkey in the middle. Slip, slip, slide! By the time I got to the second half of my sandwich, the bread was so soggy I couldn't pick it up. I had to do this sort of grab, scoop and shove. Not attractive.   Overall it was very meh. I ended up throwing most of my second half away because I didn't want to struggle with eating it. Flavor-wise, I wasn't worth the struggle. Another one to mark off my lunch list."}
{"text":"Really good corned beef sandwiches! Got it on Rye bread with melted cheese and mustard. The corned beef is sliced paper thin and stacked high - so very tender and tasty!  I also ordered one of their whole large Dill pickles. Sour, crisp, and delicious!  It's a tiny place, there are maybe four stools by the front window to sit and eat, otherwise plan to get your food to go."}
{"text":"Big corned beef fan and reuben fanatic, that being said: this place was phenomenal. Little dive, you wouldn't think twice to go in but you'll be thankful you did."}
{"text":"The Yelp information is incorrect, they are open 24/7, and man, do they know how to provide sustenance to the late niggt diner. I can't Imagine you can do better than Jake's after a long night of making regrets!"}
{"text":"Bigoted owner. Racist to the bone. Avoid this place.   After having long night out, I decided to go to Jakes for a pack of Cigs and a sandwich. I believe it was the only place open at the time. I really didn't expect the owner to be a vile bigot though.  Once there, there was a black security guard standing behind me; I wondered if he was first in line - in the North West, small convince stores don't have security guards. So I asked the Palestinian man that works there if the man in line behind me was there first.  He responded in Arabic saying, \"meen el 3abd? Byshtghl hon\" (\"who the slave? He works here.) I asked him to not say that word, (3abd, slave) and told him I'd not do business here if he continued. (Mind you this happened as I already purchased and paid for a pack of Cigs.) I cancelled my order, two sandwiches as he refused to stop referring to the black security guard as a 3abd. He said I could leave, but not before handing him back the Cigs I already paid for. I refused and we got into it.  As we left he was throwing black pepper powder on us, my brother and I.  That's the type of man you're giving your money to. A vile racist who thinks he is entitled to not only call black people slaves, but also refuses to cease these insults at the threat of losing some of his business."}
{"text":"Love their corned beef!  The service is good, prices reasonable, and it's fun to chat with other customers while waiting for your order to get filled when you stroll in at 2AM.  They're open late, way late.  Corned beef like Clevelanders should have it."}
{"text":"Just another corner store in downtown Cleveland,,thought i was getting some authentic food,got some warmed up doughy chicken that looked uncooked,just left the casino at 5am and was very hungry, thought i was gonna get some great food"}
{"text":"Okay, so I went to downtown Cleveland for the New Year's concert. Had to wait in line and was freezing my ass off in the winter storm when I identified this gem in the blizzard. I just wanted something warm to drink and a little snack to ease off my hunger. Coffee was WARM. I also got a huge brownie that was only $2. IT WAS SO GOOD. Not too sweet, very filling, and very cheap. Can't speak too much about the overall ambience because it was crowded at the time during the concert. It's not a fancy restaurant or anything - just a simple store for grabbing a cheap and easy bite. I'd go back for the brownies and also want to try their corned beef the next time. Will keep this review updated."}
{"text":"The sandwich was good, for the only food one can get at 4 a.m. downtown. HOWEVER, the person working the register charged me an extra 50 cents, obviously trying to take advantage of assuming my inebriation. When I asked why, he instantly opened the register and gave me the 50 cents back, obviously knowing he had been caught. When I got the actual sandwich, ordered as the bacon egg and cheese bagel, there was no bacon at all. When I walked back in to ask where the bacon was, the guy rolled his eyes and pulled some pre-made bacon out of a drawer and slapped it on, never changing his gloves.  AKA DONT GO HERE UNLESS DESPERATE FOR FOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. And watch how much they actually charge you."}
{"text":"Wow is this place expensive! I wouldn't have even ordered anything from here in the first place but I was with my mom and she had her stomach set on corned beef. It was $10 for a Rueben. The sandwich was pretty good...but tiny and did not include any sides. Drink prices were outrageous as well. Ya, this restaurant is right across from Tower City/Casino, but the seating facing the window with views of people getting on and off the bus ruins it."}
{"text":"WOW! 2:30 AM and this place was open?!?! I couldn't believe my eyes. Jake was everything I needed after a late night in a drowsy city. We waited for cheesesteaks while appetizing on an apple fritter and some much needed water. I can't wait to come back here...perhaps for lunch this time?"}
{"text":"I think that the best way to describe the service is day and night, maybe its the food, maybe it's just because your culinary options are limited but the nighttime food is way better than the daytime. The portions seem larger. The food seemed fresher. It just a better experience. Their Chicken Phillies and Chicken Gyros delicious some days but others menu options seem over rated (Kyrie Irving 10+ dollar corned beef comes to mind). All in all their good but still have room to  Improve."}
{"text":"Great late night spot in the town that doesn't serve food after 9pm, ordered the Kyrie Irving special, and it was awesome, quick and efficient service, plenty of dishes to choose from, nice little classic deli with great service."}
{"text":"They used to be a good authentic deli, now they cut costs and take advantage of people. I'll never eat here again. Ordered an extra pastrami sandwich because I was so hungry, walked back to my home, it was the wrong sandwich and two bites into this $15 sandwich I was so upset they gave the wrong sandwich so I took the 15 minute back walk because of principle. They admitted it was the wrong sandwich and offered to make me a new one. The second sandwich was smaller than the first one.  I complained and wanted to return it; was told they refuse a refund because they made two sandwiches , even though they were wrong. Will never support a business like this that treats loyal customers like this. All they do now is take advantage of drunk people at the casino, made their sandwiches half as big, and charge the same because people won't recognize. I was treated with such disrespect after wanting to a return a sandwich they openly admitted messing up. I really hope someone reading this that knows Jakes agrees they used to be a good deli but now they're basic and cutting costs. Taking advantage of people. I'll write as many negative emails as I can for weeks/months because of the disrespect tonight. It's about principle at this point, I didn't do anything wrong. The new guy making your sandwiches just sucks bring back the old guy and stop taking it out on your customers."}
{"text":"As a Los Angelian (I think that's how you spell it), I've had quite a few great deli sandwiches in my day. I was here visiting Cleveland for 5 days and I had Jake's 3 times. Not only is it the best sandwich in the area, they're open 24 hours and never lose quality. I had myself a good time, stayed up late and experienced Cleveland, and I still was always craving Jake's. It is by far the best sandwich in the area. Despite the average size of the sandwiches, it is really no bigger than I needed. Any bigger and I would be too stuffed. Jake's knows how to make a great sandwich, and always being open only helps them. I recommended the corned beef or pastrami. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Downtown late night in CLE, or early, or lunch, or whenever?? Go to Jake's they have everything from smokes to face sized donuts. Whatever you need they have it. For some reason I just wanted to walk in everything I strolled on by and I did, well twice. Once for a huge face sized apple fritter, which was really good, like real good. It's fast efficient has two doors, it's where ya need to stop when you need what you need. Check 'em out."}
{"text":"great place to eat at when there is nothing else open.  Everything else was closed.  This place was jumping,,lots of people.  The casino is next door, so patrons stumble out of the casino and come to Jake's.  I ordered the cheeseburger and some hot wings.  Both were good, filled my tummy when needed to most.  Service was good, didn't have to wait long for food.  will recommend for those late night munchies......"}
