{"text":"El Rancherito  1662 st clair ave west  A nice, unpretentious place. Ideal for families and large groups. We ordered the beef taco's and the fried plantain served with sour cream. Both dishes were excellent and the portions generous. The atmosphere is colorful, ethnic and welcoming. The service was also good as was the pricing which was very reasonable. The Modelo beer was a refreshing change.  All in all, a fantastic local eatery and a great addition to the Corso Italia/Junction north neighborhood of Weston-Pelham park."}
{"text":"I had tried this place in the past and liked it (though not as much as mi pueblo). I decided to order takeaway from here because it's the closest pupuseria to where I live.  I ordered some pupusas (revueltas) and some tamales.  The tamales were not good at all. They were very bland. I had to dump a boatload of hot sauce on them to make them palatable. I'd not recommend them.   The pupusas were okay although a bit chincy. Very thin and not a lot of filling. My biggest disappointment was how little curtido was included (a very small, under-filled bag for 8 pupusas was not even close to being enough).  Personally I prefer mi pueblo and going forward will be getting my pupusas from there."}
{"text":"Love the food, service is excellent, prices r amazing, big portions and most importantly the atmosphere is great! Colombian music, tv's in the background playing a soccer game or other event and this is a family run business that take pride in ensuring their customers r happy! We have been coming here over the last 10 yrs or longer and we always get a warm welcome and a look forward to seeing u back soon- this makes all the difference also I have to mention the quality of the food has not changed over the years this is important because in many restaurants it does but not here they are consistent with the quality and service. Love this place"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have enjoyed it every time.  Best: - the soup, I can't remember what it was, but it was so comfy, cleansing and delicious - the mixed paella, one of the best I've ever had. Just full of flavour and meat! - the calamari, a huge serving, crispy, no chewiness  The good: - Bandeja paisa - grilled meat platter Both of these were very good, but not extremely memorable. I found the bacon a bit overcooked and hard to cut.  This is a great place to go if you want a ton of meaty food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. mediocre food.  Came here on Thu afternoon at 2:30. Restaurant was totally empty except one other person eating. Even then, we had to seat ourselves, as waitress could not be bothered to come seat us. Had to walk up to the waitress to order beers. Meat Empanads had more potato filling than meat. The meat dish had overcooked steak. My friend, who is from Colombia, was not impressed with the food or service. Not once during the entire meal did the waitress even come over to ask if everything was OK. I even had to walk up to her to ask for another beer. A horrible experience.  There are better place on St Clair to enjoy Colombian food."}
{"text":"Perfect every time."}
{"text":"Solid Colombian / El Salvadorian restaurant.  Not that many places in TO to get a fair priced pupusa.  Beef soup was also pretty good.  Service and decor was as expected.  Considering the pricing and neighborhood, it's very decent.  Went in with no expectations but will return for my pupusa fix."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant over the weekend. There was a lunch buffet and I could tell you... it was nothing special. It was the most bland South American food I've ever had. Not only do they misrepresent Colombian food, but they also have a small Salvadoran Pupuseria on the northwest corner called El Rancherito Pupuseria. They TOTALLY misrepresent Salvadorean food too! From the pupusas, to the curtido, to the salsa. It's all bad.  You know, I still don't understand how restaurants can do this to customers. How do they not taste how awful their food is? There is such thing as internet and utube videos now a days, where you can pretty much learn anything, including how to perform surgery on people. You would think that the chefs would  at least go to an authentic restaurant and taste the food they want to offer at their restaurants from an authentic one. ugghhh, it just bugs me.   So please El Rancherito.... get a chef with better taste buds!"}
{"text":"Rude personnel. They didn't have a high chair for my 17 month old and we decided to leave. The pushy waitress' answer was \"you can sit her in a regular chair\".  We left."}
{"text":"I have never really been a fan of latin food, but I always hear something scrumptious and I'm tempted to try out. This time it is pupusas. I've heard enough about them from people to check it out. Tried out the pupusa from El Rancherito on St. Clair. Walked in to the place and it is a very typical latin restaurant. Bright colours with pictures and decors from El Salvador. Ordered pupusa with cheese and Bandeja Paisa. Last time I had Bandeja I could barely breathe. I thought that was isolated to that restaurant, but when I got my order I learned it was the same. The pupusa was good. Crunchy corn tortilla stuffed with cheese and locora(I think that's what it was called). The bandeja was good too. I liked it better than Mi Terra. The chicharron was crunchy. There wasn't too much beans. Eggs was nicely cooked and everything else was tasty. I'm not really a fan of the dish, but ordered it after the waitress recommended it. There is just too much in the plate to enjoy. Tried my sister's taco as well. That I did not think was appetizing at all. The taco had a weird taste I did not like. This might be my last venture in latin food on St. Clair or at the least it would be my last order of bandeja."}
{"text":"BEST SPANISH FOOD EEEEEVER! I dunno of they switched management but they certainly moved after a couple of bad reviews here.... Had the pupusas n fried fish...n BELIEVE ME....I'm an expert! :-D"}
{"text":"Great place to have pupusas and other salvadorean and Colombian food. Love the decor."}
