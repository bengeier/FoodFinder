{"text":"This restaurant is no longer called Thai Dish.  It is now Galangal Thai Fusion.  Had the lunch special - well priced.  Pumpkin soup and spring roll were good.  Spring roll was a little greasy for my liking.  Chose Pad See Ew and found it greasy and the chicken fatty.    Portions for lunch were good (small compared to other Thai restaurants in the city).  Service was also good.    Overall, I would take a streetcar to Thai Elephant before coming here again."}
{"text":"When you can't stand the idea of the food court at the bottom of whichever bank tower you work in, and your time permits, this is a great little spot to get away from the masticating masses. Just off the PATH system, Thai Dish offers real forks, plates, linens, etc. It has all the trappings of a real restaurant, but the lunch special prices are no more than you would be paying for a sandwich you stood in line for 10 minutes to get.   I've had some pretty inventive soups at this restaurant, but usually the lunch special includes a just okay hot and sour soup. Spring rolls are small and not too greasy. The mains are not as plentiful as in most places, but really, this is about how much you should be eating for lunch, don't you think? There's basil chicken, a red curry beef, pad Thai or a fish option.  All are very well prepared.  The restaurant is wonderfully quiet.  It's a great civil and reasonable food court alternative.  Don't bother playing the good Canadian and quietly wait for the bill. Just flail your arms or feign death if you want to back to work in reasonable time. I think maybe they believe it's rude to present the bill before you've asked for it."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced place with tasty dishes. Best part was that they allow BYOB for 10 dollars. Not many places allow that in Toronto."}
{"text":"I totally agree with the first review -- this place is a hidden gem amongst the overpriced foodcourt slop and pretentious restaurants of the financial district.  Here's where you go to escape the crowds and have a good simple meal.    Small but open and high ceilinged space with classy and mildly exotic but not overly fussy decor.  With a window seat you could while away the whole afternoon here.  Food is good and not too greasy like so many Thai places, but they seem afraid to spice it up , so you really gotta ask for it if you like it hot."}
