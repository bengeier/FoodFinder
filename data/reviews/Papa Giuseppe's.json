{"text":"Best margherita pizza I've had in a long time. Make sure you come early or reserve (not sure if reservations are possible) due to limited seating. However, the cozy homy feel is well worth it. 

The Tiramisu is really good! 

Great service. Definitely? eat here!"}
{"text":"A rustic decor as we entered that reminded me of Italy, without reservations. The food was very appealing but lacked flavour in 5 out of the 7 dishes.  The highlights were the appetizer mussels (white and garlic), the lobster ravioli and gnocchi. One big tip: the spicy flavoured olive oil condiment honestly made my Nona's pizza taste acceptable, as it was traditional stone baked pizza but soooo thin it flopped when held to eat.  The service was VERY friendly and hospitable while being comforting and attentive. The tiramisu dessert was longing on flavour, heavy on lady fingers and missing mascarpone. It was a fail for us, disappointed as they highlighted this dessert as the best.

Overall, there are better Italian style restaurants in Mississauga. After all, the food flavour is what draws all yelpers back to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food ***** - Service*** - Ambience ***

Absolutely love their food. We have been here multiple times and this always pops up as the go to place when can't decide on where to go. 

The portion sizes are good. Their pizzas, pastas and chicken dishes are delicious. 
Their tiramisu is unforgettably delicious. 

Strongly Recommended"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place in the summer, pretty great place for fresh stone oven pizzas. I loved the chilli oil they give with the genovese pizza. Really yummy. The patio in the summers is also quite pretty."}
{"text":"While Papa's does not take reservations, our group of seven was promptly seated for dinner this Wednesday evening. 

This small restaurant is cozy and welcoming, reminiscent  of a rustic Italian pub.  The service was attentive and friendly, casual and accessible. 

Our appetizers were promptly served. The calamari was nicely breaded but had little seasoning; white wine mussels were excellent. Their seasoned olives are made in house. 

However, all but one of the main courses were bland - and I tried them all :) . Only the lobster ravioli was memorable. Fettucine with a vodka rose sauce was muted. The chef's special, a pasta with anchovy and prosciutto, lacking in character. The wood fired pizza was fresh with nicely seasoned toppings, however soggy due to the thin crust.  

For desert, we enjoyed a local lemon ice.  While the waitress highly recommended the house tiramisu, we found that it too lacked character. 

Overall, a satisfactory experience due to the warmth of service and decor. Try it for yourself.  Perhaps you'll find the chef has kicked it up a notch."}
{"text":"Decent food but disappointing service.  I was recommended this restaurant by a family member who had had two good experiences here.  I decided to go with two girlfriends of mine, for my birthday dinner.  We decided to call ahead to make reservations, but they did not take them.  We were told \"it's a Thursday night, so seating for three should be no problem.\"  I guess they forgot it was Christmastime.  

We arrived at 6:30 and the place was rammed.  We were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  There were 3 empty seats at the bar and we asked if we could start there with a drink and then move to a table when one opened up.  We were told no, that if we chose to sit there we would have to stay there.  There was NO room in the entrance way, so we were recommended that we \"walk around outside\" and then they would call when a table became available.  This would have been a nice option in July, but perhaps not on a December night.  Thinking this was a rather odd way to run a business, we left and went to a nearby lounge for a drink.  We were called on the phone when our table was ready.

When we sat down at our table at Papa Giuseppe's, our server came over and poured us water without saying hello.  She later came by with pita bread and dip, and again did not greet us or say hello.  In fact, she looked rather annoyed that we were there. We later noticed a pile of pita bread sitting in a clear container right underneath the service window, open to passersby.  It was pretty unappetizing, so it was good that we had already eaten it!  After about 10 minutes, she came by to ask if we wanted anything to drink (again, without saying hello), but by this point we had enjoyed our drinks elsewhere and were ready to order.  We ordered our meals and a salad appetizer to share.  She was also quite perturbed by having to accommodate an allergy stating in a rude tone, \"yup, we DO have nuts in the kitchen\".  Okay, it was just a question!

When the caesar salad appetizer came out, it was delivered in one awkwardly shaped bowl.  We asked how we were to share this, as the only other option was to use the slim, elongated side plates that were on the table.  We asked her to bring some bowls, and with a roll of her eyes, she did so.  The caesar salad was quite tasty, I might add.

The meals were delivered to us and were all quite good.  It was unfortunate that our server never came by to ask us how they were.  The next time we saw her was about 30 minutes after the meals were delivered, and by this point another server had come to collect our plates.  Pretty sad.  When our server returned, she asked \"how are things?\" and we promptly asked for the bill.  If we had enjoyed our stay, we would have definitely stayed for coffee and dessert.  This business went to another restaurant, as we couldn't wait to leave this one.  

I might add that our server was quite friendly and jovial with the family beside us, so perhaps she just does not enjoy serving three young, attractive females.  Either way, we will not be returning to this restaurant as our server made the night quite unpleasant for us.  Perhaps we would return for take-out."}
{"text":"Papa's is a fairly small place with high prices. That said, the pizza's here are stellar out of the stone oven and well worth checking out. Stick to pizza's and specials and it's hard to go wrong!

I've had the Genovese, Calabrese and Margharita pizzas and all of them were fantastic. Some of the best you will find in the area.

Don't bother with the Gelato, there are better places in the area."}
{"text":"Cute ambiance, and the best pizza I've had in a while! However I am celiac, the pizza was supposed to be gluten-free, and I was quite sick afterwards. I'm sure the crusts are gluten free, but I guarantee there is some cross contamination going on! Just wanted to make this clear for anyone sensitive, I would still recommend for anyone that can eat gluten safely :)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Port Credit. Amazing pizzas & pastas. A very different way of cutting pizzas with a pair of Scissors. A small but amazing place.. Not good for a big group.. Will have to make reservation before hand. We were  group of 8 and had to wait for 15-20 mins. But for sure worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food is always amazingly flavourful and consistent in quality, and the service is excellent! The staff clearly enjoy working there and are welcoming to both the regulars and newbies. The patio is great during the warmer months, while  sitting at the bar gives the chance to watch them make the awesome food. Would encourage any fans of Italian food to give this place a try."}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant !!
We live in LA and whenever we are visiting we go to papa Gs almost every night
It's sooo cozy, great service, food is so delicious and all made fresh right there
Salads are great, love the calamari and pasta dishes, pizza is amazing and house red is awesome and great coffee too 
Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and today I finally did. The food was delicious! I can't make one complaint. We had the mushroom bruschetta for starter, followed by the carbonara and gnocchi. Sure the restaurant is a bit pricy but the food was very good. I've read some of the other reviews and from this one experience I must disagree with most of them for now. I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff and the room in the back area was super cozy on a rainy day. The tortellini was fantastic with the rose sauce which was very flavourful. We also like the margarita pizza. I would love to be back to give a try to other items on the menu"}
{"text":"I ordered a Margherita pizza and an insalata di Ruccola (arugula) for pick up. Because I'm not from around here, I underestimated how long it would take to get there so my pizza was tepid when I got it and cold by the time I got back to my hotel. The salad was delicious and so flavorful that I didn't even need the dressing they provided. Had the pizza been hot, it would have been amazing. I felt it was a little pricey for pizza and a salad (a little more than $30 USD including tip) but no complaints about the quality or taste of the food."}
{"text":"Nothing great. Way over priced for what you get. Not my idea of good Italian food.  Tasteless. the pizza's are ok. Period. I like to give a place more than one chance and I gave this one 5 chances. I'm nice that way. Plus I needed to explore their menu in order to give a good, not reactionary, review. I'm also not impressed with the, ermmmm, slightly unhygienic practices in the kitchen. I know why ive needed the bathroom so quickly after eating a meal there...They clearly need lessons on food handling. My last meal was a pasta dish and I chose gluten free pasta. It was horrid! Dried out chicken, almost all the pasta was broken into wee pieces and tasted stale for lack of a better word. I eat gluten free so I know what I am talking about. Also, during my last and final visit I witnessed people at two other tables returning food. Oh! I forgot to mention the salad. It too was tasteless ! How can that be? I've no idea. I can tell you that the dressing seemed to be only olive oil. And the wait staff always seem confused and they are slow. It's sad really because the location is lovely."}
{"text":"Honestly, tried much better pizza's at other places. Also if you are going to make your slogan \"we're not fancy, but we're really good\" I think they reallly should consider toning their prices down a notch, or making their pizzas a bit bigger. I will not be returning. 

However, if your in port credit, on the left of Papa Giuseppe's is the amazing Pump House Grille ! Marvellous"}
{"text":"This place has everything going for it to be a great pizza place. Too much sauce, too acidic, We've tried  it 3 times. Next time we will eat at the restaurant instead of take out. My daughter finds the Caesar salad is one of the best."}
{"text":"The most adorable quaint little date place
You feel like you're in another world.
I ordered the Margherita Pizza, DELICIOUS ! so cheesy and mouth watering.
a little on the expensive side but standard for fine italian dining"}
{"text":"Great gem in Port Credit. Service is outstanding and the food is marvellous. The only reason I don't give 5 stars it's because it's very small and the A/C can't overcome the wooden oven. The food is amazing so who cares about a few sweat drops."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! Service could have been better perhaps with a friendlier server. Other staff was very accommodating for a large party. Nice back patio, beautiful decor, but a promise of the credit river and park...uh no maybe in the far distance behind the parking lot. Our view was of the garbage cans in the back alley. I would go back because of the food and try the dinner room."}
{"text":"Nice patio in the back with lots of afternoon sun. The pizzas are very good, and they've got a rotating list of daily specials which are reliable.

I ordered a perrier to drink and the waiter brought over a huge bottle for the table, cracked it open, and poured before I could say I just wanted a glass. Not a huge deal, but I didn't like the assumption that I wanted the biggest size they offered...and sometimes that's all it takes to annoy you for the rest of a meal. 

Sandwiches are huge! Probably the best Italian sandwiches in the area (although 2x the price of most places)."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great food! Great atmosphere. It's tiny. But they have s patio in the back. 

They offer amazing gluten free options as well as vegan and vegetarian. The selection of wine isn't bad and overall the food to price balance is great!! It's partially owned by the owners of The Pumphouse Grille next door. 

I've been going here off and on since it opened. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza, served with scissors for custom slices. 
Intimate seating, nice outdoor patio for summer."}
{"text":"As usual Papa Giuseppe's did not disappoint!  It was very cold and rainy this evening, so stopping in for dinner was a great idea! Papa's is small and warm since the kitchen and hot pizza ovens are open to the restaurant. The wait staff are also attentive and friendly - in fact I was able to get a sangria even though the summer drink menu is not yet available.

To satisfy my craving for thin crust, I ordered the Calabrese pizza which comes topped with sopressata, pepperoni, cappicola and hot peppers (hold the olives for me). When all was said and done, let's just say I didn't carry a box home!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Be prepared to wait during peak hours, but it's well worth it! Upon arrival, you receive complimentary bread and sauces that are delicious! I've had pizza here twice, but over the weekend I decided to try the four cheese macaroni pizza and it was amazing! They provide you with a knife to cut your pizza and it makes it that much more fun! I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"I started by reading all of the other reviews posted about Papa's. I'm appalled at poor rates. Let me begin by saying that absolutely everything I've tried here (more than 5 visits) has been fabulous, consistently. I might even go as far as to say they serve the most delicious food in the Port Credit area.

I've tried plenty of menu items. The one's that I've found to be especially good are The polpette (meatballs) any of the pizzas are wonderful, my favorite pasta was Capi's tortellini, with the vodka panchetta sauce. It's worth mentioning that I'm not a fan of sweet things. I simply do not like dessert. Papa Giuseppe's however has something called a dessert pizza. It's delicious, I couldn't believe it, big enough to share with a couple buddies too. The prices are higher than the standard italian place, but are by no means 'expenive'.

The food is wonderful, I like the location and the interior vibe. The service is attentive but can feel stiff from male servers. By and large It's a wonderful place with wonderful food. Anyone from the Port Credit area who hasn't tried it yet should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I really like this place for some hearty Italian food in Port Credit. It's pretty small inside but last time I was there they opened a covered and heated patio in the back. The prices are very reasonable and everything on the menu is pretty delicious. It's a very casual place so do not expect super fine ingredients but you will enjoy your meal and go home super full."}
{"text":"This amazing little gem in Port Credit is a personal favourite of mine. I've been here many times over the years so this is simply an overall review of Papa Giuseppe's.

The food (appetizers, entrees, and desserts) are amazing. The service is phenomenal and they really treat you like family here - hence the name Papa Giuseppe's. 

Not that it would stop me from eating here but there's a few downfalls to this trendy restaurants. 

Reservations are not taken. It's on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
I recommend you hop over to the Pump & Patio a few doors down and have some drinks while you wait. 
+
The space inside is a little tight but the atmosphere is great. They added a closed-in (rain of shine) patio due to the lack of seating inside to accommodate more guests. If available, wait a little longer to dine inside."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Sat on back patio. Very friendly staff. Caesar salad was good. We
Had the \"Rocket\" pizza which was very tasty. Loved the thin crust with balsamic. Good food. 2 adults and a child shared salad and pizza. Light lunch."}
{"text":"I tried Pasta Fra Diavalo and Margherita and both of the dishes were good. I especially loved Pasta Fra Diavalo  as I havent eaten this good Pasta in GTA ever. The Pizza is thin crust and thats way a Pizza should be.The area at the back is lovely for winter time as You can sun bathe while you eat. 
The only draw back for the place is the price. A simple Pizza Margherita is for 18+ taxes. Other than the price the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Great little spot for great pasta and yummy pizza. In the summer you can sit in the back where it's more romantic. And they have the best wine- Pinot and Sauvignon blanc.  

If this is too far try marcellos in Vaughan for also great Italian food."}
{"text":"Super cutesy place on Lakeshore. The food is delicious and there's always parking available at the library right next door which is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I went for date night on a Wednesday. We arrived at about 6:20pm  and the place was pretty busy which is not something to complain about. There's a reason why this place is so popular, the food is AMAZING. We sat on their covered heated patio which was very nice, the whole place is very intimate. They started us with bread that came with 3 different sauces, it was fabulous. Not to long after we ordered our mains were on our table. We chose the three cheese tortellini with the vodka sauce which was honestly the best pasta I've ever had. We've been to a lot of Italian restaurants and they've been good but this one is great. We also had a pizza (I'm not sure what it was called) and it was so yummy! I actually can't wait to go back! As we were leaving the restaurant was full and there were people waiting to be seated so keep that in mind when visiting!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, awesome service, awesome patio. There's not much to hate about this place other than the wait time! Price is pretty good and overall I've had great experiences here!"}
{"text":"I went out for dinner with the gf for date night, and we were both blown away. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer to start. Their sauce is so good, I can easily drink it in a glass and it's a bonus that the meatballs were a good size. One more piece of garlic bread would have made it better. We both ordered wood oven pizzas and we were more than happy with the taste and size. The flavors of savory and spicy meats worked perfectly on my Italian version of a meatlover pizza(I wish I could have wrote this at the table to remember the name, but no cell on date night haha). We were both so stuff that dessert was not an option. 
 
The place is small, but it was packed for the dinner rush. Although this didn't affect us, I would recommend anyone coming with more than 4 people to book in advance. Other than that, we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best and probably most authentic pizza places in Mississauga.  

Ambiance:  A fairly small place with an intimate and cozy feel that make you feel as part of the family.  

Service: When I came here, the place was packed (on a Tuesday night no less) but I was promptly seated.  All the waitresses were super friendly.  

I ordered a pizza that was most vegetables and tomato sauce with no cheese.  It was kind of pricey at $15 or $16, but the quality was amazing.  It was a very thin crust yet not soggy at all.  The tomato sauce was killer good.  

In terms of the size of the pizza, they are big but may not be that filling if you are  a big eater or just finish an intense workout like I did.  However, if you eat like a normal person, one app and one pizza should be more than enough for two people.  

Verdict: A great place for a date night or just to chill with a few friends. As Arnold would say, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have visited Papa G's on 2 occaisons, and had a great experience both times!

1st visit: A friend and I were milling about Port Credit and stopped in for a bite. We got a veggie pizza to share and she also got a caesar salad. The pizza was so great, and the salad came in a very generous portion. 

2nd visit: Visited for dinner on the long weekend with 5 friends, we were told there would be about a 30 minute wait but didn't mind waiting. We really only had to wait about 15 minutes and we were lucky enough to score a spot on the super cute back patio. I ordered the pizza again and loved it, and a few of my friends got the meatball sandwich (the meatballs are HUGE) and the veal parm, which were both well recieved. 

The service is a little slower than anticipated, but the food is good! I would totally go back to this spot a 3rd time when in Port Credit :)"}
{"text":"Love this cute little place. Great family restaurant. We come back periodically and always enjoyable!"}
{"text":"came back to try the godfather sandwich.  really good. meatballs were perfect, cheese was tasty. came with a side salad.  i'll be back for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Papa Giuseppe's is quaint and totally adorbs! :D 

Yes, I am absolutely too old to use the term \"adorbs\" but it's done now, live with it.

It's such a tiny restaurant but my friend and I had no issues squeezing ourselves into the bar. 

A couple of tips for your visit:

1) Their house wines are pretty good. I had the white and it was a light Riesling and I like my wines enjoyable and not so dry to suck the life our of my tongue
2) Their table bread is naked pizza, but they had three (3) types of dip, balsamic, tomato sauce and garlic
3) Then we had the wild mushroom bruschetta - I was surprised it came on pizza dough. I would have preferred it on crusty baguette... Their regular bruschetta comes that way.
4) Buffalo mozzarella, tomato and beautiful leaves of basil... WINNER!!!! It was so good and I just wanted to bathe in the vinegary cream sauce thing. Like seriously, scrub me down.
5) Based on reading reviews, the pizza is more highly rated than the pasta so we shared the chicken with sundried tomatoes and artichokes. It was good. Their hot oil wasn't very hot. That made me sad. Also, it's true about this whole scissors thing. It's kinda fun, although both of us were really boring and cut triangles... I mean, what other shapes can we do?? I would like to propose a challenge, post some pics of your crazy shapes and I will endeavour to do that next time I go!!!
6)Tiramisu - eh. Housemade but I've had better, although at least I wasn't up half the night! Sometimes that espresso they use is too strong. I did love the strawberry gelato! Note: all desserts seems to come with a giant dollup of whipped cream... Maybe it was my server but way too much cream and I am sweet enough!

PS. If you order take out, they totally give you this cute plastic pizza cutter - I think it's free, I saw them handing them out... I totally want one.

Also the wait staff was totes (yes! pretending to be young, don't hate, celebrate!) cool. They were a bit slow but lovely and the chefs chatted with us while we stared at the giant pizza ovens. I shudder to think about the short life of the pizza that goes into it. Ek."}
{"text":"Papa G's gave me an uncut (cooked) pizza and a pair of scissors and let me have my way with it. I cut triangles, I cut the letter T, I even tried to cut circles. Truth is, I couldn't have cared less if the pizza was actually good because I was having so much fun cutting my own pieces of pizza from the pie.

(Side note: Why don't more restaurants let you cut pizza with scissors?)

Fortunately, the pizza was good, really good. It was thin, crispy crust just like I like it with a white sauce, cheese and prosciutto. Yum, right? Right. I also ordered a side Caesar to start, which was lovely.

The place is on the small side and it feels like you are eating at your Italian uncle's restaurant. They also have a nice, covered, patio out back that's a decent size and even features rain guards if you get stuck out there during a storm. All in all, it's a lovely spot for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star rating for this place!

This was a great choice to dine and catch-up with some friends. :-)

They enclose their patio during the winter and have plenty of heat lamps strategically positioned around the area to keep it well heated.  They also provide blankets if you need that added layer of warmth.

The place is small so be prepared to wait during the busiest times.  We dined on a Sunday evening and luckily there was no wait.

I have an affinity for mushrooms so I naturally gravitated towards the wild mushroom brushetta.  It was a great group starter and a decent amount of wild mushroom flavour.  I always dislike it when I see mostly button and cremini mushrooms in a wild mushroom dish.

I ultimately decided to try one of their pizzas (the calabrese with additional arugula) but it was a tough choice.  The pastas also sounded delectable.

The crust of the pizza was very crunchy, firm, and could hold the weight of the toppings as you went to eat it.  There was a good layout of the toppings so that each mouthful was consistent.

The table shared their lava cake and gelato dessert and it was done well.  We even got an extra scoop and a candle because we were celebrating a birthday. :-)  It was a very nice end to the evening.

Wonderful time and I can see why the locals recommend it."}
{"text":"Outside area was nice with the large windows and quite warm under the ceiling heaters. The lunch prices are a bit high - same as dinner. Pasta and pizza were quite good. Male host was a bit surly and unfriendly."}
{"text":"I did enjoy Papa Guiseppe's; it's a homey style of Italian place with big portions, and good food but I just expected more and left a tad disappointed. 

This place was rather small, and a result busy and we were told there would be a 45 minute wait at 8:30 on a Saturday evening. But fortunately were given the option to sit at the bar instead without any wait. 

We went with their basic salad, their veal parmigiano, and their spaghetti and meatballs. Their portions were massive! We couldn't finish their pasta dishes or all the proteins in the dish, and ended up taking it home - at least I had a nice decent lunch the next day! Not only there was a a lot of pasta, the meatball and the veal was massive. The fettucine in the veal was not quite right but the sphaghetti was definitely better. The pomodoro sauce was good. The salad was really basic, I thought the greens could have been a bit more crisp and fresh here. 

Pricing could have a a bit more fair, I do suppose the portion sizes do reflect that, but taking leftovers home isn't the most ideal situation."}
{"text":"I had the bruschetta to start and braised beef ravioli for my entree.  My girlfriend had the Godfather meatball sandwich with a Caesar salad (which I ate).  Bruschetta was perfectly crispy, salad was delicious, pasta was fresh, and the sandwich was pure heaven.  We both absolutely loved our food and will be returning next week!"}
{"text":"Walking by this place the smell just drives you in!  A nice covered patio during the summer....not many seats inside though.

All the dough is made fresh here and you can even buy their bread....the pizza and pasta were excellent."}
{"text":"Charming gem in the downtown district of Port Credit.  Our server was extremely cheerful & helpful to guide us through the menu.  The lobster ravioli is made in- house and very satisfying.   Insalada Zucca with pumpkin is a good starter.   Two Canadian and one Italian beers on tap, however, we chose the Italian Pinot Girigio which was light and smooth.   

Some reviewers stated the decor needs an update.   I think they don't realize the owners worked hard to create a truly country Italian ambiance.  The front dining room is small but warmly inviting with table seating and 6 bar seats.   A beautiful outdoor patio in back is great for warm weather dining."}
{"text":"A taste of Italy in Port Credit! This place is a hidden gem in Port Credit. Its a small and cozy restaurant and is the great place to go for a casual date for any season. the service is always friendly but there is a long wait time since it's small and always busy.

Everything I've had is delicious! From the pasta to pizza, its like eating in an Italian Grandmother's house! The pizzas are hand crafted and have a rustic feel, for the spicy pasta lovers get the Calabria. Its got a good kick of spice to it but the dish is still well balanced.

A must have is the tiramisu, make room for it and you won't be disappointed! It's rich, creamy with a good hit of coffee, its definitely the best tiramisu I've had so far!"}

Can someone smack me please !!    
So we came here and I tried the most incredible bowl of pasta ever !!! The smoked duck pasta ..
Holy ...Fu...........like seriously wtf have I been missing out on all these years ! 
This place is truly amazing in my opinion.
The food is great the service was good very friendly and our server was sweet ! The atmosphere was great very cozy and the deck has a great vibe .
It is small but very cute ! 
I'm sorry for the language but seriously this place is fan Fu....tastic!!! 
If your here in port credit don't do what I did and miss out .
Go in and try it !!"}
{"text":"Papa Giuseppe's is a pretty solid place, I'm actually quite surprised to see it only has an average score of 3 stars on here.....people must be out of their minds.

To begin with, I must admit that this place is rather small and seating is limited, so maybe that's what angered a few people.  There have been a few times where I tried coming here with a friend of mine and we simply had to go somewhere else just because there wasn't any seating available.  Putting this fact aside, however, the place is rather nice, with a very rustic authentic feel on the interior.  However, my friend and I normally sit on the patio, which doesn't have the greatest view but the patio now has a roof, heat lamps and a transparent plastic walls for when the weather isn't cooperative.

The food itself is rather good, I might even go so far as to call it outstanding.  While the pasta is great, I'd have to say their pizza is even better.  It has a very unique taste and texture to it that you just dont get at standard pizza places. There's just something about it that makes me want to say \"thank you mamma\".  The pricing for pizza and pasta dishes is usually somwhere around $16, quite average.

Check this place out, it's worth your time, don't trust the other reviews."}
{"text":"The food was good, the pasta portion was relatively small, the service was kind a slow, and what bother me the most is the flies... I can't enjoy eating without shooing the flies that keep coming back.. Very annoying  other than that what I can suggest is to give a basket of Italian soft bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar while you wait, like in most other Italian restaurants, so the wait does not feel as long."}
{"text":"I was visiting Port Credit looking for bridesmaid dresses and then decided to walk the streets looking for a place to enjoy a nice lunch. It was a Saturday - so my fiance and I waited until a little after the lunch rush and decided we felt like a good ol' bowl of pasta. Papa Giuseppe's to the rescue! 

Upon arrival, the outside and even the front entrance way of this place are not the most glamorous. We were not deterred though, and ventured in to be seated in what looked like was a back patio that was still being enclosed due to the weather (this was an exceptionally nice day, but others were not as nice so I understand). The decor is seemingly old Italian type traditional and a little drab but really, no big deal now let's get to the food!

The menu is quite large - with pizzas and pastas a plenty. I ordered the Gnocchi and my fiance ordered the Carbonara. Two of my most favourite dishes so I was ready to be impressed. Boy was I ever impressed! The food came out really quickly, it was literally steaming hot (probably the hottest dish I have ever received at a restaurant), and smelled delicious. We decided to share both dishes with each other and I instantly regretted it because I loved the Gnocchi so much, it was so decadent and creamy, with walnuts in it too! The Carbonara was really tasty as well, with lots of Porchetta - but I just couldn't part with the cheesy Gnocchi. I was ready to shed a tear when it was finished. 

Papa Giuseppe's, I do have to say you surprised me. From the drab decor - I was served up some wicked delicious and filling pasta dishes. I would definitely order both again (next time I am eating the Gnocchi to myself though, yes I am greedy). I even saw people cutting their Pizza with scissors! I am going to go back again just to do that!"}
{"text":"Let me start off and tell you that I loved this little restaurant. Book a table before you go as they have only a small amount of inside tables. I was taking my wife and mom out for a nice dinner but not too fancy. I personally prefer restaurants that have character, this place has that. They were quite busy and luckily we got the last booth by the door, again wish we booked ahead of time. A lot of people shod up right after us and they were unable to get a table. I had the wood fired pizza and it was good, Mom had the seafood risotto and that was amazing. Will definitely go back again..."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Saturday evening but was still able to snag a seat in their back area.  It's a cute area.  It gives you an outdoor feel but you're still fully covered in a heated space.

I wasn't very hungry but wanted to get my greens in for the day, so I opted to get a salad. I did want a bit of protein so I added prosciutto for an extra $2.  My friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  We did get the bruschetta to start and meh.  I wasn't really a fan.  I didn't like how they make it like a \"pizza on a pita\".  See pic.  I don't like crust to begin with, so when there is an excess of bread I don't tend to eat it.  That's so much bread space that could be covered with tomatoes!  It's just a waste to me.  Plus the bread wasn't great either.  

The dressing on the salad was very light.  I actually devoured almost all of it and it was a lot of lettuce.  I probably wouldn't get it again as the only reason I got it was because I wasn't hungry.  I'll definitely try a pasta or pizza next time I come.  I did try a bit of the meatball from my friend's dish, and it was pretty tasty.

Nothing to really rave about, but again I'd have to try something more \"authentic\" on the menu."}

Homely little deal; this place is super cozy. And I've been wanting to try it out for a while. I am glad I did. We were attending a Yelp Event right across the street, and wanted dinner before hand. Papa Giuseppe's was a spontaneous plan. We walked in and informed the server that we were in a bit of a rush (only 30 mins). And she complied with speedy service. 

Got the menu. The menu has 2 sides. We were in such a rush that we didn't figure that out. So we couldn't really find the pizza on the menu anywhere and did not ask either. Just like \"Where the hell are all these people ordering the pizza from?!\" But there it was, on the other side. 

We got a pasta to share. Simple Bolognese. And it was delish! 
I wish I had a chance to try more. The couple sitting at the table beside us ordered so many appetizers. And the lady ordered herself a whole pizza. I was pretty damn appalled. The pizzas are massive and clearly shareable! I would pick this place over Pump House Grille next time."}
{"text":"This place is cute and charming perfect for a casual date for pizza lovers!!

A very small restaurant that specialize on pizza and are very good at it. Base in the heart of Port Credit this tiny restaurant is a little gem. But can use a bigger space, winter was a cold day due to doors opening and closing.

I forget the name of my order but I clearly remember the taste it left in my mouth. It was tasty, cheesy, explosion of flavour and simply delicious. They also serve you spicy olive oil and makes you wonder how they got the olive oil so spicy.

The size of the meal was perfect for 2 and the appetizers looks good as well to keep the munching going. Don't forget the spicy olive oil.

I definitely recommend this place and you won't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Mississauga. The service and food never let's down. The pasta is very flavorful and not bland. They have great pizza and apps as well.
Recommendation: Cappi's Tortellini with rose sauce"}
{"text":"We tried Papa's on a whim one night while out walking in Port Credit, and it's become one of our favorite restaurants in the GTA. Friendly staff and great food that is consistently prepared correctly every time. 

I'm a sucker for the pizzas - Calabrese and Tre Porcelini are my faves - while my wife loves the pasta (Nonna's with rapini FTW). 

Papa's is a cozy little place, and sometimes there is a decent wait time to be seated. We'll usually arrive before 5 to beat the evening rush. They do not take reservations, although we've called ahead to see what the wait times are like. 

Looking forward to the Burlington location to open!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was fantastic. Staff was super friendly. Will return. Started with some apps. Calamari, Wild mushroom bruschetta, then had the Osso buco lasagna..which was amazing! Chicken parmigiana was also ordered by table."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere. Service was awesome and quick, so if you're looking for good Italian food right across the Port before a nice marina stroll, you're in for a goodie!

Nonna's Pizza: a crisp thin dough that worked great as a \"folder\", covered in a well seasoned red sauce. Vegetables like artichokes and spinach could have been more plentiful for my preference. The cheese was delicious and soft with a light saltiness. A good share for two!

Meatballs: oh man, these were good! A great texture and flavour. I've had some that were over-seasoned or drenched in red sauce, but these were a healthy balance with a nice cheese. Could have used more crostini though... three is NOT NEARLY enough for these guys!

Get a seat on the closed patio and you'll be loving it :)"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and just as pleased as the first time. Margherita pizza at 15$ or so is great and the Brooklyn Lager (which apparently is from a brewery in Brooklyn) was pretty good too. They have an indoor heated patio where you can get the sun rays in the fall/winter."}
{"text":"This place looks good on paper...... but the end result is not good.

By way of example:  the antipasti platter looks fantastic according to the menu, but the included cheeses (not detailed on the mneu) are Swiss, aged white cheddar and a spicy Monterey Jack.  So wrong.  The cheese is served cold, sliced in 1-2 inch squares, looking like it's cut from a block of cheese from No Frills.  The meats are not much better.  The proscuitto wrapped bread sticks were okay.

It's too bad Hooks (the former restaurant in this location) is gone.  It was fantastic.

We will not be returning to Papa Giuseppe's."}
{"text":"A very nice, quaint place in Port Credit. We went in for lunch on Friday and there were a few people sitting on the patio. It was just a bit too cold for me, so we decided to sit inside. The waitress was very nice and more than happy to accommodate our vegetarian diets. We had the mushroom bruschetta, penne with arrabiatta that I forget the name of, and margherita pizza, all of which were amazing. I especially liked the pasta. Would definitely come back here when it's warmer so we can sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"It was pricey, but yummy. It's about $20 a person no matter what you get here. The atmosphere nor the quality of food exactly warrants the price either. It was good food, but nothing exceptional. Much better options down the lakeshore strip for similar prices or even cheaper."}
{"text":"3.5* Food is just ok to me.

Came on a weekend, around 2pm and there was absolutely no wait.  Usually, there seems to be a line-up on peak times like Friday/Saturday lunch and dinner times.

We ordered a Moretti, Zucca Salad (pumpkin), Mediterranean, & Tiramisu.  Both salad and pizza were ok, the crust wasn't crispy.  I've had better pizza elsewhere.  If you share it between 2 ppl, price is not bad.  Otherwise it's a bit big to have on your own.

In terms of the beer, I was really surprised when it came in a tall pint.  I'm pretty sure there was only 1 price listed for the beer, so when the bill came, I was surprised that I was charged more than what was stated on the menu.  As soon as I brought it to the waitress' attention, she immediately rectified the situation.  She was very nice and friendly. 

Sandwiches/pastas seem pricey at ~$20 each, but at least with the pastas you'll most likely have leftovers, so it's a bit better in value.  
 
I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but I'd probably try the pasta instead.  They looked good with good sized portions."}
{"text":"If you love thin crust Italian pizza, go here! Very small and always packed, though. Can't say too much. I had a nice meal but have never had the craving to go back so I guess it just didn't make much of an impression on me?"}
{"text":"Two stars only because we found it marginally better on our first visit two years ago. My Nona's pizza tasted like all the ingredients either came from a can or had been prepared many hours prior to final cooking as a pie. A liberal does of hot oil overcame some of my disappointment but it should be used as an accent to the dish not as a mask to underwhelming flavour. No one finished their meals and we did take the leftovers home just to be courteous but I doubt they will be consumed."}
{"text":"Best customer service and amazing food. I ordered the roasted red pepper soup and chefs Alfredo (I added mushrooms, peppers, and chicken chicken). My partner had nonnas pizza. All the food was wonderful and we didn't have to wait long after ordering. We waited about half an hour to be seated in the patio (by choice) because the indoor part of the restaurant is very small and tight. Located in Port Credit. Beautiful lively area with lots to enjoy. Average price for food, but really worth every dime. I recommend trying it out and I would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"What a cozy vibe! Came on a Friday night so it was expected that we would have to wait for 45 minutes. The staff were SUPER nice about it though. 

I ordered the nonna's pasta and my friend got a fettuccine. The place didn't disappoint! There were HUGE portions, and the flavors were well balanced. Combined with the homey and authentic Italian vibe of the place, this place is definitely a winner. 

Wish they had more space though - they definitely need it!"}
{"text":"I like Papa Giuseppe's, its quant, Italian, and the food is great. My only quarrel is the amount, which isn't too little, it's a bit too much...for the Antipasto that is. I'm the type of person that when food comes, i'll finish it no matter what as i don't like wasting food, especially when it's someone else that spent the time to prepare it. 

The antipasto dish was, first off really good, but very hard to finish with myself and a date...and i can eat! By the time your finished, you realize that the pizza your ordered is going to be hard to start and almost impossible to finish. 

Either go on a large appetite or go with a large group. I had a great time just would have wanted a little less..Sometimes less truly is more."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and I am a fan overall.
I do love that they closed in their patio area to ensure a greater space as eating in their original space is tiny and unpleasant.

I get a pizza every time I go. Most recently I ordered the Genovese pizza with extra pesto. So delicious! Finished off the meal with a scoop of gelato, mint chocolate chip. Again, it was delicious! However, the one scoop was $7 which is far too much for the amount you get. You can get an entire tub of ice cream for that price. Yes, I get that home made should mean something and fetch a higher price. But not $7, perhaps $5?"}
{"text":"Five stars for pizza, service, place, taste, even the washrooms! This place can't do any wrong.

Went with two friends and each of us got a pizza.
Sat on the bar and got a great view of how each pizza was made.
Service was genuine and prompt.
Saw our pizzas get made from scratch.

All of the pizzas were handcrafted to perfection, no bullsh*t, fresh ingredients, cooked right every time.
They're all thin crust and delicious.

They served some bread with several sauces, one was the marinara, one was balsamic and olive oil and the third was unknown but still good.

I got the Al Formaggio:
THE BEST CHEESE PIZZA I EVER HAD
Creamy, delicious and the flavours went perfectly with each other. I made a mistake in ordering this pizza but it was the happiest mistake of my life.

Another friend got the Gevonese? Genovese? Pizza.
Pesto, chicken, sundried tomato etc.
Delicious and I'm pretty sure this was the one I meant to order but I'm glad I got to try both. 

My other friend got the daily special of the Tuscan Margherita. It was a mix of the Tuscan pizza and the Margherita.

I tried them all on their own and with the house-made chili oil. Delicious both ways and if you want a bit of heat the chili oil is a nice touch.

If I wasn't so full, I would've loved to try the lava cake and the caprese insalata that was made in front of me for other patrons.

{"text":"Wow.. this place is Amazing! One of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to. I had the Tortellini with rose and cream sauce and it was great! I had the presseco drink and Pink Lemonade cocktail.. I preffered the pink lemonade one, it was really nice. I also had the ceasar salad and a cappuccino with (shaved nutmeg on top). I enjoyed the customer service, simple and attentive and fast and the food was very Flavorful and FRESH! Honestly guys.. this place is a Must try period. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place! Third time back here, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Food is amazing, portions are perfect - the quality of the food is amazing, but it's not annoyingly American in the sense of getting way too much food - instead of focusing on having eight different sides, they put all their love into their main dishes, and it shows. Only downside is it was super dark in there - to the point where I almost couldn't see my food, and their pizza is slightly better than their pasta. But I'll definitely be back, trying out the margherita pizza - again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pizza with chicken, pesto, sun dried tomatoes and artichokes, which was delicious. Their chilli oil was die for. Great experience and would definitely go back to try more pizzas."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice only, but really enjoyed my experiences here.

The first visit, I came for dinner with two of my foodie friends - one of whom is Italian, so he's super picky about his home country fare!

The second time, was with a fairly large group for a lunch on Saturday.

ATMOSPHERE: Warm and inviting. The place is small, so either make reservations or be prepared to wait! It is located in picturesque Port Credit area of Mississauga - so in the summer it's no problem killing time with a little lake-side stroll.

SERVICE: Varies depending on server. The first time I was here, the owner served us - he was very knowledgeable but may seem curt and unfriendly if you're not used to his style of manner. My friends had warned me that he's a nice guy, just can come off as stern sometimes. 

My experience with my recent visit with the weekend lunch staff was very good. We were a large group, so we had to wait for them to rearrange a row of tables to fit us. They were very hospital, and answered all our questions and needs as required - we did not feel neglected as sometimes a large group can be difficult to manage.

PRICE: Very reasonable. Average for a casual sit-down meal.

FOOD: Really good. Everything is very authentic, flavourful, well-portioned.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been trying to get into Giuseppe's for a while but they don't take reservations and there was always a one-hour wait so we'd just go someplace else in Port Credit as there are plenty of options. However, on a really cold and snowy Saturday night we managed to get seated immediately. 
Man, we should've waited all those times! What a great place! The ambiance is very cozy, can be romantic. The service is great, extra points for the (included) focaccia bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and different sauces. My boyfriend and I both ordered pasta, mine was a creamy pesto sauce, his was a tomato sauce, both were delicious! We have to go back to try their pizza 'cause it looked amazing."}
