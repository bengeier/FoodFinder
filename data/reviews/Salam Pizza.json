{"text":"Not a good pizza place. We picked up a pizza and some others to go. First of all, the service itself wasn't awful, the young lady working the front was very pleasant but set up for failure. It took forever, and there was family eating in and one other waiting that were upset about how long they've been waiting.  The pizza was awful. The sauce, the dough, the way it was cooked, all of it was not good. I will not be trying this again."}
{"text":"Third time wasn't a charm.  When they first opened I was super excited since they are so close to me but albeit I was dissapointed. The lady at the counter was very sweet but the dishes I tried were either very dry or to sour. I thought maybe they need time to settle and work out the kinks but the 2nd and 3rd time still didn't do it for me. (It even messed up my stomach). Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing.  They're called Salam pizza so their specialities must be pizzas...sigh. Ok fine, I've convinced myself to go for a 4th time."}
{"text":"We have now eaten here three times and every time the food has been exceptional.  What incredible flavors.  My favorites are the Specialty Chicken Pizza, Hummos, MatabelI and all the little pies with my favorite being the Zaater Pie.  I would suggest ordering extra pitta to go with the Hummos and Matabell, as you really don't get much, but they give good portions on the dips.  The first time we went, back in September, there was frustration about trying to call in an order and nobody picking up the phone.  The restaurant is very close so I drove over and it was very busy and they just opened.  I am so glad we have this new restaurant so close to home.  It was well worth the wait because the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The hummus is like crack. You just can't stop eating it. I prefer it with the crunchy pita chips."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic! Not only is the food out of this world but the owners are super nice and the restaurant is spotless - by far the cleanest bathroom I have ever seen in a restaurant! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Had to take my son to the barber and stopped into this place a few doors down. I'm from New York and I forgot that most places down here don't sear slices. Ordered the personal pizza with chicken, made to order. Was excellent! Wanted to get one with sausage which they didn't have so went with the lamb. Yep, lamp pizza. To die for. Place has a Mediterranean flavor with great greek salads, hummus, falafel, kibbeh, rotisserie chicken and wings and other dessert specialties like Baklava and Katayif that are not easy to find in Charlotte. Turkish coffee. Pleasant place, clean with painted photos. I don't understand what the other reviewer found so bad about this place, it seemed like he was just not a nice person."}
{"text":"So I really really wanted to like this place. I LOVE mediterranean food and had such high hopes. Sadly, it is sub par and I am left feeling unsatisfied. My husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich and...as you can see from the picture, it looked NOTHING like the photo online. Right side is their online presentation, left side is what we got. I ordered the falafel sandwich and it was meh. Who puts thick chunks of pickle in falafel sandwich? Mr. Geero's was/is so much better. My daughter got the ravioli and it was just OK. I dunno, maybe their pizza is good? We won't find out, so disappointing."}
{"text":"Although they are still working to get everything up and running, this amazing little restaurant is a wonderful place to go eat, or to get dinner and take out! Absolutely delicious, and Betty, one of the owners, is a delight!"}
{"text":"Salam has such a wide variety of food & all of it is amazing, the owners are so sweet."}
{"text":"We've been anticipating Salam opening for a while now, seems like it took them a year or so to open. I attempted to call in my order on  Saturday evening around 6:30. Tried to call 3X, no answer. I decided to bite the bullet and just go there since it's only a 5 minute drive. Was expecting them to be very busy based on the fact that they weren't answering their phone. They were empty except for one table. When I noted that the phone must not be working the young and rather unfriendly man at the counter said he stopped answering it because they were slammed. I call BS on this, this is lazy and irresponsible for a place that just opened weeks before. After getting \"clarity\" on their confusing menu( daily specials are only offered on that particular day, so if you want some Shawarma you can only get it one day a week. This is a ridiculous and frankly stupid policy. Don't put it on the menu if it's only available once a weekI !  ordered the Special Pizza and Chicken Shawarma platter. The pizza was delicious, meaty, and filling. The Chicken was HANDS DOWN the worst chicken I have ever had. It was dry to an extent that it had the texture of warm beef jerky and actually looked like chips of some kind, inedible. The hummus and tabbouleh that came with it was pretty good but they FORGOT MY PITA, which I mentioned twice while ordering. I threw the chicken platter in the trash where it belonged and ate my pizza. I know they are new and will experience growing pains, but my initial experience was straight-up bad. I don't see myself going here again any time soon until they get it together. Hire more friendly employees, make better food, and fix the confusing menu!"}
{"text":"My Wife & I are former NY'ers who used to frequent an Egyptian restaurant near what was our home in NY...so when we found Salam, we were most grateful!  The delicious chicken shwarma plate was our mainstay, yet lately we've gotten the lamb plate, which, to our surprise, is real lamb (unlike the processed stuff in other places).  Everything is fresh here; portions are generous; the restaurant is clean, and the owner who works the front is very kind.  Lately they've cut down on the amount of salt they use, which is good, as the other flavors of the food are brought out.  The fresh lemon they use on their chicken makes the plate most delicious!  I did mention my Wife & I are former NY'ers, and we're well familiar with homemade Greek desserts.  We recently tried Salam's baklava, which is among the very best we have ever had:  not too sweet nor too mild; not too buttery, nor absent butter.  Among the very best.  The only bad thing I can say about Salam, is that it's hard to be on a diet once you acclimate yourself to their food :)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! As someone with a Mediterranean background I fell in love with the homemade hummus, lentil soup, and falafel sandwich. Unfortunately I live about an hour away so I can't frequent that often, but if I did live close I'd be a regular here for sure! I honestly wish I could have tried everything, and next time I'm in the area I will definitely try more off the menu. The woman who was working there last night too was funny, kind, and very sweet. I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a ton of food for takeout..everything we got was amazing!! Baklava is the star of the show!"}
{"text":"By far the best falafel in the city, sorry Pita Pit.  Their prices on their 'falafel sandwhich' which is really a pita is insane and their side order of falafel was just as good.  This place is 30 min from my house but I make a trip up there to get take out at least twice a month.  Haven't tried their pizza but typically when I am waiting to get my food, the pizzas I see come out look really well made."}
{"text":"We went here three times.The first time the food was amazing. It was nicely presented and was fresh! But it still took over 25 mins from when we order till eating.  The second time we went in to order and they told us they had sold out of the Friday special at lunch! Okay so make more? It was 6pm and there was more people behind us wanting the special. We ordered something else but was unhappy because we waited a week for the Friday special.  The third time we ordered to stay. They took (im not kidding) over an hour to make our order. They bagged it up and handled it over. We said that we were staying and unpacked the food at the table we had been sitting and waiting at. The order was missing food. When we asked they said 'oh yea, we're out of that' for two items and no other remedy was offered. We didn't like how they tried to short us on the food assuming it was a to go order and that we would have taken it home without it being right.  My fianc√© said never again due to the dishonesty of the workers.  I gave 3 stars because the food is good but they run out of the specials on busy nights and the wait time is unbelievably long. We just can't afford to spend that much time waiting for dinner. The couple next to us called in the order and they were still waiting in the booth for an additional half hour after they arrived."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma and hummus were inedible. So much spice. I think they dumped the spice containers into the shawarma. Rice was decent... only thing I ate. The wait was long. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The best place hands down in Charlotte. Everything on the menu is to die for. It is fresh, flavorful ,with intense rich flavor that will delight your palate  The baklava is very light and not a super sweet. The pizza dough is made fresh to order and the soup is made fresh every day. Mmmmm I can't say enough about the hummus."}
{"text":"Nice for a Saturday lunch. Stopped in on a whim because we were at the Raptor Center and hungry for lunch. Ordered a classic, pepperoni and sausage. Came right out, delivered to the table and piping hot. Light, crunchy crust, slightly sweet sauce, great ingredients. They were doing a brisk carry out business while we were there. Would recommend and come back another time."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza was excellent. They make the dough when you order so make sure you plan ahead. They are the only local pizza joint that offers the gluten free option.  Stuffed grape leaves? were the best we've ever had.   Make sure to get some baklava too. You'll want to throw one into your order once you see it at checkout.  We'll def be coming back. Worth your time especially if you like legit Middle Eastern dishes."}
{"text":"Have a feeling this is our new favorite local spot. We tried a variety of things: the chicken shawarma (came with hummus and tabbouleh), falafel, Greek salad and a couple of the little pies. Everything was freshly cooked, delicious, and presented with care (garnished, nicely plated). The lady at the counter was friendly and she patiently answered our many questions. Can't wait to go back and try the pizza. They seemed to be doing a brisk takeout business. Prices were fair, too."}
{"text":"Went back tonight and the food was fantastic. Baba gah pun was the perfect texture and not too smoky. Grape leaves were tasty. Plenty of pita and the tZatiki was amazing. So glad this is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is great here.  Try the kibbeh. Kufta, a Friday special, is also great. Nice people, too.  Give it a try! We need these kinds of places!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been searching for a place in Charlotte/Huntersville area with a good gyro since we've moved from Ohio! I'm happy to say we have found it! Gyro combo plate came with a delicious portion of meat with pita and also included a small Greek salad and fries! The service was amazing, very nice staff and quick food service! I can't wait to try out the rest of menu, they have everything from falafel to lasagna!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Im from Cali but was out here in NC for my sisters graduation, on our way back to our hotel we decided stop by for some pizza and this place was on our way. So happy we stopped here , not only do they have delicious pizza but Mediterranean food as well. THE FOOD IS SOO GOOD! everything tastes amazing and fresh! The place is very nice and bright. Both of the ladies there were super nice and welcoming ! This was my first time eating Mediterranean and it is amazing, and the pizza was delicious and cheesy Wish It was closer to home lol , Next time I'm in town , I'm def coming back !"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Saturday special, chicken family dinner, and a couple of appetizers. Everything we ordered was delicious and very plentiful for the price. We were very pleased with the dinner and will certainly return in the future. Service was a little slow that evening but they seemed to be getting a lot of carry out orders at the same time. I am sure this will improve as they get their feet off the ground."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the falafel wrap and fries. I love the fact that they took it upon themselves to make sure the fries were vegan by frying them in a separate fryer. Highly impressed and appreciated. Happy vegan!"}
{"text":"My in-laws suggested Salam for dinner on December 23, as it was a newer place to go eat in town.  Walking in, it's very pleasant, with bright cheerful walls, and a few tables and a couple of booths to sit down and enjoy a meal.  The menu isn't just Greek food, it has more Middle Eastern cuisine, plus pizza. The menu choices reminded me of a couple places back home (i.e. Laylas, Fairfield, CT).  The owner, Betty, greeted us, was very friendly, and she herself brought our dinners over after a long wait from ordering. There was only one waitstaff who was very nice, but I know she had nothing to do with the longer than normal wait for food ordered. We found out it was Betty's husband who was preparing and cooking all food orders....since it is a newer place, help is needed in the kitchen (need at least 2-3 per shift), and certainly another waitstaff to not only make sure the customers are taken care of while dining in, but also to get the phone for take-out orders. One waitstaff is not enough.  There was even a Help Wanted sign in the window...for all positions!  Now....for our dinners! My mother in law enjoyed the kibbie, with tabbouleh and tzazkiki sauce, topped with some pomegranate seeds. My father in law thought the kufta was very tasty. My hubby ordered a small cheese pizza, and really enjoyed it! He likes to try pizza whether we go, and he declared this to be the best pizza that he's had in NC!  I enjoyed the beef shwarma sandwich, which came with a side salad (wish there was more lettuce, way too many chopped tomatoes!).  I definitely would go back here next time I'm in NC, they just need to improve upon getting more staff to help in the kitchen especially since the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Those looking for authentic Mediterranean cuisine in the Huntersville area, this is your place. Everything was well seasoned, prepared & priced.  Gyro and Shawarma plates were top notch. Hummus is some of the best I've ever tasted. Baklava was savory sweet awesomeness. I look forward to trying their falafel next time. Great food and recipes are the cornerstone of this place. You could easily serve me this food at an Uptown establishment for twice the price.   One big caveat... service is slow by restaurant standards, so just plan accordingly. There was only one (very nice) lady working the counter & then heading into the back to prepare the food... at 1PM on a weekday, so plan on around a 20 min wait or more, even if they aren't busy. I'll be calling in my order from now on.   They have an extensive menu, almost to a fault, as they offer everything from shawarma to pizza to stromboli to wings to ravioli to tacos. My personal opinion, if they focused solely on their Mediterranean dishes that shine, shortened the name to just Salam, & hired at least 1-2 more people to help with efficiency, they'd increase sales 5x-10x.  Definitely give this place a try if you enjoy legit Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek food in town. Great pizza and excellent hummus, taziki, pies.  The Greek salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for lunch or dinner if you're craving Mediterranean food! I got the falafel sandwich and was full! Also got matabel which is delicious! I will definitely be back to try the grape leaves and lamb shawarma on Friday."}
{"text":"Not super impressed but not a total disappointment either. The pizza is of decent flavor and an excellent low price - the price to quality ratio is a positive one. I've also had the \"hummus with meat\". The naming is rather vague - they should add \"lamb\" to indicate what kind of meat. This is an unusual combination as I imagine lots of folks eating hummus are not meat eaters. I am a meat eater however and yet the meat just added more oil to the dish that already had plenty of oil from the hummus itself. It was an unfortunately very acid-reflux inducing dish. The pita that came with it were not toasted and were actually chewy - maybe they forgot to do something to them? Lastly, the price of the dish was not so great at nearly $10.  Service was no problem at all - they mostly keep their distance. It's the kind of place where you order at the counter and find a table. They bring the food to your table and then the rest is up to you. The restaurant is clean, quaint and quiet and sort of \"out-of-place\" in this northwest Charlotte Food Lion shopping center. I would probably not go back again as I was not particularly impressed with quality or price."}
{"text":"The fella and I stopped at Salam Pizza when we unexpectedly found ourselves starving near Northlake mall (and thus surrounded by mediocre food). I was pretty pleased with the food quality here, but not blown away by anything.  We were absolutely the only people in the establishment at 1:15pm on Saturday, which felt a bit eerie. We waited 15-20 minutes for a kebab wrap and a combo of dips that I ordered. The baba ghanouj was REALLY garlicky, but the hommus and tabouleh were pretty yummy. The fella liked his wrap, but it really was just an affordable joint to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"The best Middle Eastern food in North Mecklenburg county! Delicious, home made authentic dishes with friendly service and great prices. Pizza and Italian menu items as well but the Middle Eastern dishes are our favorites!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. They now serve lamb Shwarma every day of the week! Would recommend as a good take out place."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Some of the best in Charlotte, and it's a Mediterranean place!  They have awesome hummus and other Middle Eastern fare.  I highly recommend this place!  They are very friendly, but I wish they were faster or at least more accurate with telling me when the food would be ready.  Last time, everything was ready on my order and I was waiting on my pizza - when I got the pizza home, it wasn't particularly warm, like it had been sitting in the back, not like it had just come out of the oven.  I was a little disappointed, but I still highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food! Pretty impressed with this little strip mall joint. I got 4 meat pies, a medium pizza and Greek salad for 24$! Will feed my family of 3 for dinner and 2 lunches tomorrow. And there are actually Greek people running it. Mom at register, dad in back cooking, daughter doing homework in booth. Really friendly, super glad they set up kitchen here :)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place as ive been looking for some really good pizza but was disappointed. I ordered online and when i get there the lady looked at me like i was crazy and said she did not have any online orders and ask if i knew how to do it. Then she says well let me check and came back and said \"oh i just didnt put it in. It will be ready in 10-30 minutes.\" So even though i ordered ahead and waited 20 mins i had to wait 30 more. As im waiting she has a nasty attitude and tells me i should call next time so im not waiting even though i did place an order online and its her fault she didnt put it on. When i finally got my food i didnt get any topping on my pizza like i asked for. Im sad to say i wont be back."}
{"text":"Salam is right near my house so I have ordered from them a couple times. My biggest issue is that they don't answer their phone, ever. You'll have to go in to order and either wait or if you have things to grab from the grocery or CVS you can do it while they are preparing your food.   Their pizzas are actually quite good, however, their meat and cheese pies are really nothing more than a slab of dough with a small amount of topping on it. I have yet to try any of their weekday specials, but I'm holding out hope that they are more along the lines of their pizza quality."}
