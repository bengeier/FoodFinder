{"text":"This place is Great! It's so clean and pristine and the people are really kind  

I got the Cabano's burger and it was delicious. It's a family owned lil sandwich shop that has a great atmosphere and right next to the Manulife centre so it's a great place to grab a quick snack before you go see a movie."}
