{"text":"WARNING! this place is horrible! Beer selection is crap. Server hardly knew anything about the beer or food. Ordered nachos which was just nachos and cheese and nothing else and cheese was cold. Ordered a pizza and could swear it was store bought. Could've def had a better meal at home. And cheaper. Menu is a little pricey as well and small selection. I never have complaints about food or beer but this is that bad. Good luck staying in business brew house with food, menu and service!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Tried to go there to eat before a band started were told that all the empty tables were reserved! But we would get first available! An hour later after being totally ignored we stood at the bar to eat! Than found out the rude arrogant host was the owner! Shame on him! We would have eaten somewhere else if we knew we weren't getting seated! Bar was packed and only 1 barmaid! Finally got a beer that was 1/2 foam!"}
{"text":"There was nobody in this place when we showed up. Probably because it was so nice out today, and the hostess sat us right away. We were seated by the awesome fireplace in the center of the room, and our server was a very sweet girl who told us she had only been working there a few months. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and tots with a whiskey cocktail (dont recall the name but it was off their menu for 8$) the drink was more ice than anything, but the flavor was good. I highly recommend the pretzels app w/beer cheese. Mmm.  seriously loved being next to the fire place, and my boyfroend loved that the Indians game was on the tv directly over it. The curved booth I sat in was very spacious, almost oddly spacious for the VERY SMALL table that was between the two of us. You could probably seat 3 more people on the booth chair, but the table could hardly handle our two drinks let alone our food \"plates\" more on the \"plates\" later. My sandwich was great. The bread was crispy, but not overly, the pesto was amazing, the peppers were perfectly cooked. Lots of flavors, very enjoyable. The tots were phenomenal IMO the best part of my meal. The two of them together were worth the $9.99 price. Those wood planks though, why? Why do they use those awkward wood planks instead of plates? Sure, i'm all for 'character' but those things dont fit the style of the place at all. They take up more room than necessary, especially on our tiny table. The server even said \"where would you like me to put this?\" Referring to the plank of wood containing my lunch when she came over to us with our food. She had already placed my boyfriend's plank on the table, and now the plank, and drink glasses (2 waters, and 2 cocktails) were holding all of the space available. We shuffled things around for her, and laughed about it. All in all an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went here for happy hour. Let me tell you, there was nothing happy about it. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks from the bar. And my martini barely drinkable. I ordered the burger medium rare, it came out burnt. The server seemed annoyed that I didn't want to eat it and didn't offer to have the kitchen cook a new one. My friends flatbread wasn't worth the $8 as it hardly had any toppings on it. The bottled beer and fried pickles were the only items that weren't a total disappointment, but let's be honest, you can't really mess those up. I'm very disappointed in my visit and will never return."}
{"text":"All in all, this place was an average experience.  The beer was a little warm and the cheese for the pretzels was very generic.  On the other hand, the rest of the food (burger and nachos) were very good.  A live band (easy listening) was very good but was rather loud for any type of conversation.  The decor was quite nice to boot.  The thing that brought this place down was the staff.  The waitress we had was not very plesent and service was very slow.  It took 45 minutes just to get the appetizer.  Other wait staff seemed the same.  Would be much better with a stronger focus on customer service but the food and atmosphere was pretty good."}
{"text":"The Brew house was recommended to me by a coworker.. I'm out of town and prefer a local place to eat. I can eat chain at home. The brew house has a good beer selection I highly recommend the mystic momma ipa. For a meal I had the fried pickles, black and blue burger and fries.. They were average at best the blue part of the burger was slim to none. The service was ok."}
{"text":"Glad we decided to give this place a try. One of Parmas biggest issues is the lack of of good restaurants, so it refreshing to find a place with good food and decent beer selection. We ordered hummus and a pizza and both were good. The pizza had fresh ingredients and was large enough for two people to share. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The beer prices were not bad at all. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I must say what a special little gem this place is !  I went here last week with a friend, we sat at a cozy booth seat right next to the fireplace. Our service was super, really nice waitress I'm sorry I didn't catch her name but she was very nice!  They had a band playing that night, not too loud or crazy but really entertaining.  Our food was yummy, we really enjoyed the whole vibe of the place.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am something of an aficionado when it comes to buffalo chicken wraps. And that a good beer selection is nothing short of essential to me when I'm picking out a restaurant. And that I positively adore Parma (and yes, I know that it's not a \"cool\" city or whatever, but I don't care. I love it).   I was hanging out with some friends and was very, very pleasantly surprised by the Brew House. An expertly made wrap, with grilled chicken instead of crispy (which is different, and every bit as delightful as it sounds), and one excellent selection of beers.  Oh! And the fries! Crispy and delicious, and seasoned with Parmesan cheese! I was not expecting that.   Excellent food and drink specials. Great atmosphere. And it's in that wonderfully suburban town that I love so dearly. Perfect. Perfect perfect perfect.   Great place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cordial service and delicious food. You may bring your dog to the patio area so great for a post- hike hefeweizen!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best sports bar in the area. I have become a regular since this place first opened.  There are several reasons for this: the management is great and the owners are constantly striving for improvement. This is best expressed with their menu and the way they treat their customers.  The beer selection is great and always growing. Don't see a beer you like? Bring it up to one of the owners or the staff and they will get it for you!  Another major point I'd like to make is the type of crowd this place draws. I have never seen a fight, argument or anything similar.  There is young people, old people, married couples and whole families come in for dinner and to watch games.  The layout is great, always clean. There's also a fireplace inside and the patio is nice as well. Live music on the weekends packs the place and the atmosphere is fantastic.  Awesome burgers, the Chicken Cesar Wrap is also amazing (fries topped with Parmesan come on the side). Try the Calamari, Pizza or Loaded Fries! CHEERS and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting, dirty place I have been too. I think the health department is going to be showing up here soon."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by for lunch.  The server appeared to be unhappy and unfriendly.  The place was very worn (the bathroom was filthy).  Plates on table had food particles on them. Everything except the appetizer I had to have a second choice for including the beer. The food took quite a while and when it arrived it was cold and the meat tough.   I was not pleased with the whole experience.  Advice to server: a little kindness and an apology can smooth over a bad dining situation."}
{"text":"How does an establishment not have any sugar or sugar substitute when serving non sweetened ice tea?  Then they look at me like I'm an A hole for asking"}
{"text":"Newly opened place in the former Scorekeepers/BW3 location. Spent a lot of time at the old BW3 and played softball w Scorekeepers as a sponsor so I am very familiar with this bar.  Interior is completely redone. They added kitchen space, a large new bar, contemporary furniture and made the fireplace the centerpiece.  Still pretty big, with plenty of room.  Bar staff was nice, but the investors were walking around, so that is to be expected. Beer is about 24 taps and some bottles, about 1/3 craft and the rest is crap. Not bad though, two Fat Head's beers, a Buckeye brew and several Great Lakes. Expensive, I think my Head Hunter was over 6 dollars. Also weird is two guys next to me ordered bottles of Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster and weren't initially offered glasses. Hopefully they work that kink out. I know it's Parma, but a glass for a 9 percent beer is not pretentious.  Food is ok, also pricy. Had e wings(so so) and the loaded tots(good).   Not sure what this place wants to be, but they dumped tons of money in this joint and Parma is, well, Parma. I will try them again soon."}
{"text":"Average! Nothing special about the limited menu. We drove up for a concert and ate here first. Do  NOT go if you are in a hurry.. very slow service, even when there are only a few customers. They were having a PPV fight later that night, so the steaks that we were coming for, were not available. We all had wings.. not bad, not great. Drinks are expensive and not worth the money. Server was nice."}
{"text":"While they had a wide variety of beers, they had absolutely no description of them so I picked one I knew how it was.  Got the brew burger which the brew sauce was literally just mayonnaise.  Otherwise the burger was just meh."}
{"text":"Brew house has an excellent selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles. Their pizza is delicious!  Matt (bar tender) knows his beers and was great to talk to. If you're in the area, stop in. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"EH...  thats really all i have at this point. Its a cool local spot, but the service sucked. Rude waitress, got the orders wrong 3x and then told me that if i didnt like how she was serving i should go across the street to the venue...WELP i did. I left mid meal, paid for what we ate which was just some apps and a few drinks. Like how rude can one be?  The food was subpar, the guac and chips were the highlight of our \"experience\" but i will say the loaded nachos were a good amount for the price. we HAD ordered the brewhouse banger flatbread but because of our waitress she brought us out the porky. we sent it back, it didnt look appetizing. Hence her attitude and basically kicking us out. We also ordered the Brewery Sandwich which again SHE got wrong and brought us out a club sandwich, which we would have been fine with had she not slammed the plate down in frustration for HER being a mediocre waitress.  Alas, all of 30 min in this place and i definitely will never be coming back. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here for the cav's game tonight. Nice televisions everywhere, but still had a classy feel! Sat inside and there was a really nice fireplace in the middle that I got to sit next to. The wait staff was really nice and attentive for how packed they were. Got a half order of the boneless wings and they were delicious! Better than bw3's by far. I'll definitely be back. There was even some live music during halftime. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Walked in this restaurant and it smelled really bad. When we sat down the smell got worse. Asked the hostess why it smelled like that and she said they are cleaning the grease trap. I'm sorry but you should not clean those durning business hours. It's gross and no one in our party of five could stomach the smell."}
{"text":"I had purchased an $18 Groupon for$30 of food, so my daughter and I had dinner here on Wednesday, 5/31/2017. Seating was fast, service was good, too; however, we were only the second customers and it was only shortly after 4. We ordered an appetizer of bruschetta and each had the Chicken Caesar Wrap which came with fries and a small container of catsup on each board. The meal was very good and prices on he menu are competitive to other establishments serving bar food. Do not expect spaghetti meals steak dinners; they serve strictly bar food. We did not order an alcoholic beverage. We arrived shortly after opening, which is 4 p.m. and I noted the tables were all set with a small plate and wrapped silverware. The tables did not appear to be very clean as I saw smudge Marks on a nearby table and our table had crumbs on it. The floor had bids of food on it m; I was seated near a window and noted the blinds had a pretty good coat of dust. For the reason this particular establishment does not appear to be very clean, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Oh, Yelp, when will you allow fractional star ratings? I so want to give this place 3.5 stars, but alas, my hands are tied with your outdated single star system. You see, for it is not the fault of Brew House that they are being robbed of this half star, oh no, it is Yelp who has stolen this from them. Allow me to preface with this, I have bestowed upon thee oh Brew House Bar & Grill, the rating of 3 and one half stars. You are definitely better than average yet just shy of winning my fandom. But why? Why not four? You were so close...  About 6:30pm, just your average Wednesday. There was visible construction happening on the outside deck, a sign of progress and better things to come, no doubt, but being our inaugural visit we opted to experience what the innards had to offer. High ceilings, ample light from large windows that line the front of the building and flat screens hanging from just about everywhere they could be hung - 2 behind the bar, 2 above the bar, 4 massive screens flanking every side of the mammoth, square fireplace centerpiece, a few more dotting the walls of the dining room for good measure. Clearly catering to the sports bar crowd.  I found the seating arrangement to be a bit curious. Very large, vinyl-clad banquette style booths surround the fireplace but the tables they service are small, two-tops. Not sure why you'd wand a bench that could handle 5 asses surrounding a table built for two. I thing regular tables would have made for a better use of the space, but I'm no interior designer. Sorry, getting tangential on you.  Empty. That's the first word that came to mind when we walked in. There were only two people in the whole place. Probably just felt extra vacant because of how big the space is to begin with. The restaurant staff was huddled at the far end of the bar having a conversation. Employee meeting, maybe. Anyway, we were greeted by the bartender who told us to sit anywhere and took one of the hightops by the bar. Our server broke off from the pack and wandered over menus in hand smile on her face. She was pleasant and gave us some time to peruse.  With a name like Brew House you'd expect them to know their way around a beer tap. You'd be right. While the draught beer selection is large, 36 taps, it is populated in large part by a great deal of \"ho hum\". I get it, they are trying to cater to a very broad demographic, not just beer geeks. I bet the locals aren't exactly a crowd big on sour ales and barrel-aged imperial stouts. That being said, there were a few gems among the rocks including several local beers from the likes of Fat Head's, Great Lakes, Buckeye, Thirsty Dog and Black Box. Check out their bottles list, too, and you just might find something you've never had before. Kudos to the staff for serving my Goose Island in a sparkling clean hefe glass and for bringing my bottled Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA with an equally clean pint glass.  Gripe - No prices or pour sizes are listed on the beer menu.  The menu here is pretty large with the usual bar food staples (wings, quesadillas, wraps, nachos - along with sandwiches, pizza, salads, burgers and some larger dinner-sized entrees. We weren't all that hungry so we opted to split a house salad and turkey club sandwich with tots. The salad was good (not like too many salads really blow my mind though), chopped Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cukes, croutons, shredded cheddar. Fresh, crispy, good balsamic vinaigrette. The turkey club was very good with turkey, ham, bacon, LTO. The toasted white bread was a disappointment, however, and the sandwich could have been elevated with some ciabatta or thick-cut whole grain. The tots were perfect, crispy, crunch, golden nuggest of cylindrical tater goodness. Just what one wants in a tot.  I guess I'm a bit on the fence with this place. They do have a very good beer selection, the service was good and delivery was well-paced, and the food was tasty. The atmosphere even feels nice and open (aside from the annoying boom-pish dance music that was playing nearly the entire time we were there - just strange) and I bet the fireplace feature is great during the winter, I just can't think of something that was all that memorable about our visit. Maybe we'll give them another shot sometime."}
{"text":"Great food and service ! I got the cevapi with fries , it was amazing! Love when they have music and entertainment great place to hangout with friends !"}
{"text":"Brew house has a wonderful ambiance. Walking in it feels not like regular neighborhood bar. It's classy and nicely furnished. The big stone fireplace in the center just makes the whole scene.   The food isn't worse. Most notable,for me, is the brew burger. It was the perfect amount of juicy and the salami just completes it. I also had the Parmesan garlic wings. Flavor was great although they were a little dry. No biggie. I followed those up with the burger and all was dandy.  Also, the burger doesn't come alone. It brings some friends in the form of their own house cut seasoned fries. Sprinkled with Parmesan, they are aMaZiNg!   Altogether a great place to hang out. Plenty of TVs to watch whatever game you need but also classy. And on some nights they have a live DJ. Which is great!  I didn't have any beer when I went just an iced tea so don't ask on how those are but most people seemed to be enjoying theirs.   Would go again, and would definitely bring friends again."}
{"text":"Sat down and the place was empty. I overheard the owner having a conversation with a group at the bar about business. He didn't know how often the draft lines were cleaned. Thankfully I ordered a can of ipa. The salmon I ordered was extremely over cooked. The veggies were obviously frozen. Horrible. I asked them to take it back (which I hardly ever do). I ordered the buffalo chick wrap. The wrap saved this place from getting a one star. The waitress was super nice but the owners conversation that I overheard makes me never want to support him or his business."}
{"text":"This is not a place I would go to on my own so keep that in mind.  For a bar, I liked how the seating was comfortable and it was not a grimy sports bar.   Couldn't tell you if the beer was good, but my friends seemed to enjoy what they ordered.  I ordered some sort of vegetarian flatbread/quesadilla.  It was actually pretty good with a variety of vegetables. They remembered to keep the mushrooms out.   I also enjoyed their tator tots. Service was good.  Again, this is not the type of restaurant that I would typically go to, but I had a pleasant enough experience and would encourage you to try it if you want a clean friendly atmosphere to watch a sports game that has good American food."}
{"text":"In town from out of state and tried this place based on Yelp reviews. Great band on a Saturday night. Poor service. Sat at the bar, watched the waitress cover half the bar and a table on the floor. Took 30 minutes to place our food order. Drinks were empty more often than not. She lost someone's credit card behind the bar and spent 15 mins trying to find it. Guy sitting next to us ordered a beer and got a menu. Got his beer, waitress never came back for his food order. He waited thru half the Cavs game... Nothing. Bolted. Place was busy but not packed. No bar back in site, dirty glassware piled up on the bar. Too bad. Nice place otherwise but if you can't answer the bell on a Saturday night, you're probably in trouble."}
{"text":"The old Scorekeepers location...........  i never liked that bar, but I did have some good memories from that place.  I came here with a friend about 2 weeks ago as we were looking for something new.  We walked in and saw an old coworker from our Marc's days working here.  After talking to him for a little bit, he said he was one of the owners of Brew House.  Great guy, his name is Mladen, so if you see him be sure to say hi.  The place is completely remodeled, you don't even recognize it if you've been to that hole Scorekeepers.  Couches, fire place still there, and it looks extremely upscale inside.  They did an amazing job with that.  The menu is small but the food is fantastic!  My friend had the burger but I forgot which one but he said it was great.  I had the fried pickles with the cajun horseradish sauce as I wasn't that hungry.  They were amazing.  that sauce was delcious.  Not too hot, yet just enough heat.  The service was spot on.  The bartenders were attentive and always around.  They constantly checked up on us, but not to the point where it was an annoyance.  I was a bit disappointed in the craft beer list.  It wasn't anything all that great, when by being called brew house, I was expecting an exotic and extensive list.  They can always improve that though as it's the easiest thing to fix.  To compensate for it, they did have an exceptional list of Euro beers, most of which you won't at any other bar anywhere.  I'm a craft beer aficionado so I still had to order local IPAs.  All in all, I highly recommend it; and do yourself a favor and start out with the fried pickles with cajun horseradish sauce."}
{"text":"Actually the worst place ive ever been too. Took a half hour to place order. Got water 15 minutes after that. Ordered entrees with salads. Hummus and pita for appetizer. One dinner came 30 minutes after that fish and chips no cole slaw. Two more dinners came 30 minutes later no salads no hummus. Told 4th dinner was out of salmon hour after she ordered.ordered wrap never came. Dizzy waitress unsanitary kitchen and cook that looked like he needed some grooming and thats being nice. This place needs help."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. They had a band the night I was there, it was out on the patio. Couldn't hear myself. Talking was impossible unless you yelled. We sat as far away as possible. When I got there I ordered a gin and tonic. $7, really? Did I mention the tonic was flat and I believe there was no gin it, as I could not taste any. The food was normal bar food. Nothing special, it didn't stand out to get me to return. So if you like mediocre this the place for. As for me I'll take a pass."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a great place to hang out.  It smelled clean when we walked in which you don't find very often in a bar.  Great drink selection, menu and live music.  You can tell the kitchen would benefit from some expert advice - seems a little underwhelming compared to what it could be.  The food was ok, not a bad experience, just nothing memorable.  I look forward to trying again as this place gains experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in here around noon on a Sunday. Only a few people at the bar. Our waiter was a very nice gentleman-may even have been the manager. The beer selection was good, although if you're going to call yourself the Brew House, a more impressive selection would be expected. The food was pretty good. Kids had fried pickles, French fries and chicken fingers. I had a tasty chicken Caesar wrap. Would definitely recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Brew House I had a great experience, but this time was a totally different experience. My best friend and I went to Brew House to watch the Cavs game. When we walked in the restaurant was relatively empty but quickly filled up. We chose to sit at the bar so that we could be closer to the tvs. In the beginning the bartender was pleasant but as the night progressed she became very rude!! My best friend and I ordered burgers; I ordered medium rare and she ordered medium well. It took a very very long time to receive our food. It would not have been a big deal if other people around the bar that ordered after us didn't receive their food before us. It took over an hour for two burgers, which is way too long. After receiving our food we realized it was not right! My burger was not cooked what so ever. It was literally raw meat slapped between two buns. To top it off it was cold, which was the result of the bartender not going to check to see if our food was done. I had to flag down the bartender to ask her if she could warm the burger and tots because they were cold and she was so rude about it. I told her never mind and she could just take back the food. My best friend also said something about her food and the bartender brushed it off. We didn't end up eating any of it but the bartender made my best friend pay for her meal. As we were leaving another person at the bar commented on how bad the bartender was and it sucks that our food was so bad. Avoid Brew House like the plague. I would have given the restaurant zero stars but unfortunately that is not an option."}
{"text":"Weird is the best way to describe it.  Came on a Sunday with the fam.  Didn't realize the Cavs were playing so every other place in the area was packed with bro types cheering on LeButthole traitor ass as they rolled over the Celtics.  One girl waiting on all the tables.  Tried to sit us at those weird split booth-things by the fireplace.  Were a family of 4.  Just put us at a 4 top...like its been done for hundreds of years.  Pretty decent beer selection.  2 out of the 3 I ordered they were out of.  Nice.  Gonna call yourself \"Brew House\" ya might wana have the \"Brew\" part?  Beer list doesn't have prices.  I literally had to ask the girl what the prices were for every beer we ordered.  Shady practices if ya ask me.  Never, under any circumstances will I be SO STOKED to see Chillwave on tap that I will not care that your jacking me 6 dollars + for a draft beer.  Put the prices on the list and stop with the BS.  Got over charged for the beers I DID order and after she corrected it I wansn't even given an itemized list of what I got.  Apparently people in the Heights are so affluent they don't care.  The whole time I had the feeling that this place was doing me a favor by having me dine there.  Food was really good and they have tots.  Also, in step with all the other places they are going for this minimalistic, hip vibe which I can do without.  If I wana eat my burger off a wood plank I'll take up carpentry...."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to check out a band, The Spazmatics. The place was pretty busy so we sat at the bar. They have a very large variety of beer on draft and the bartender was knowledgable about the different kinds. I tried a grapefruit beer on tap and had the 'Diablo' burger with tater tots. It was cooked to perfect temp with a kick of spice (very tasty). After a few drinks, friends and I ended up dancing most of the night. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Great staff! Amazing food! Good environment and the bands on weekends are awesome!! The fireplace is so unique and definitely a place I want to continue to go to! I highly recommend this place if you're looking to have a good night out with friends or some good lunch/dinner with the family!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to watch my favorite band, Disco Inferno, play. Large crowd out so be sure to arrive early! Very large menu, I had the loaded tots and the chicken Caesar flatbread. The tots had a tasty beer cheese drizzled on top and the flatbread was unique. Some places have a very thin, dry cracker-like flatbread but this was thicker, and MUCH tastier. My friends were amazed by the large beer list, but I had a pitcher of the red sangria. The bartender was very personable and attentive. A+ all around, will be back soon to hear the other bands and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I came here based on a yelp review that said their wings were excellent. I concur ! Nice, clean place with good wings. Next time I' ll hit the place on Wednesday when the wings are 50 cents. The only annoying thing is that they are one of those places that need to take your credit card if you want to run a tab. I appreciate that some people run out on their bills, but when I am told as soon as I get there that I can't be trusted, leaves a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is our favorite \"secret\" spot because it is always pretty empty, even on game days.  Bonus is there are 4 tables available that have the fireplace and your own personal tv.  The specials are great and the drinks are good.  The food is better than typical bar food with flat breads, hummus, and even their fries.  Everything is fresh.  Oh... their beer selection is also very good."}
{"text":"All I have to say is FINALLY! In the ongoing search for a good after soccer eatery in Parma, the Brew house graced us with it's magnificent presence. Place after place, the SnailCats and I have tried, looking for a Tuesday ritual rendezvous.  I caught sight of this gem on the way to a game a few weeks ago. It hadn't opened yet, but I made my case to the team in the hopes that we would have a place to go at long last. The first day we were able to go, I was beyond excited. It was everything I dreamed. The beer list is amazing and you can get the 22oz for $5. Great for the many beer drinkers in our group. I only really care about food....  This is still just the pre-menu....menu, but everything I've had was great! The first Tuesday I had the BBQ chicken flatbread. It was to die for. The sauce was a little sweet and the crust was light and crispy. Perfect. The second day I had the bruschetta and snagged a few bites of my boyfriends Maui Wowie pizza. Both were delicious. I can't wait to get ahold of the full menu next Tuesday!  The staff is friendly and has a good sense of humor, which is crucial in dealing with soccer hooligans. The interior and patio are lovely, although the chairs outside are a tad uncomfortable. A small price to pay for the new home of the SnailCat soccer team. I hope you're ready for us Brew House, because you'll be seeing a lot of us. Every Tuesday to be exact.  P.S. The bumble berry comes with blueberries, which is awesome. Plus, they have three pronged forks. When do you ever see that?! Almost never. They're my favorite."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty. We had just went to the Progressive International Motorcycle Show in Cleveland and were looking for a good place to get a bit to eat. Being from out of town the only thing I had to go on was the Yelp reviews. I have to say it did not disappoint. The food was good, the service was good, and it was reasonably priced. we'll be back."}
{"text":"Happened to go here on a Wednesday with my girlfriend.  They had 50 cent wings (which I was unaware about) and decided to get 12 buffalo.  They were awesome.  My girlfriend got some sort of fancy chicken (parm?) sandwich that was also great.  I was still hungry after the wings so I decided to get a burger which was also cooked to perfection and the pretzel bun added a nice touch.  We didn't get the fries but the tater tots are unreal.  Beers and drinks were relatively cheap.  Atmosphere was that of a classy Buffalo Wild Wings.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Brew House twice in the last few months.  The first time was during my 20 year high school reunion.  The place was jam packed and there was not much room to move around.  There weren't enough tables to eat at and there were no standing tables, which would have been a nice touch.  The pizza they served was okay, nothing special.  The bartenders were slammed, so the slow service wasn't their fault.  I made sure to tip them, as per usual.  I couldn't help but to feel annoyed by the venue.  The second time I visited the Brew House was for a fundraiser.  The place was absolutely slammed, yet again.  Couldn't get a drink due to the poor bartenders running like mad trying to get hundreds of drinks.  They could've used another bartender or two.  On this occasion, I had more pizza and I tasted their buffalo chicken wings.  The wings were large and pretty tasty.  They had a good kick!    My reviews are skewed because I've only visited on two occasions and both were catered events.  Both were annoying due to the small venue and the slow service."}
{"text":"I will definitely be going back. The bar manager was very cool and went over a lot of the beers with us. They have a great beer selection and the prices are good. The tater tots were really good. Glasses of wine are $4 :) and there are a lot of other beer specials"}
{"text":"I went here to go meet up with some friends for a drink. I have also been there many times before that. The beer list was great. They had double IPAs and heavy Belgium beer.   My issue was the music. It was being run by touch tones/ jukebox. I paid $10 through the touch tones app. I can't stand country music so I played some Rolling Stones, Zeppelin, and Neil Young. I only heard 4 out of 10. The app shows you what songs are coming up next. Since I payed a little more, I was able to choose the \"play next\" button. I know that bars have remotes that can alter the sound/ songs for their jukebox. They skipped over my songs just to get back to Luke Bryan. Really? People, like myself, paid money for something and next received the benefits from that. I won't be heading there again. Brew Kettle any day!"}
{"text":"I would come here again for the beer and to watch tv on one of their couches. The beer selection is a decent size but features some not so great beers and the beer menu has no descriptions. I would think twice about ordering food. We had the Brew Burger and the single piece of salami did nothing for the lackluster patty. Even the yummy pretzel bread did not save this sandwich but the fries were good. Not sure about the planks they use to serve your burger - awkward.  Someone else got the steak which was better than the burgers . Cooked at the right temperature but needed seasoning."}
