{"text":"This is one of my and my Freind's favorite spots, in fact it is the only place where we can have authentic hookah, and Mediterranean food. We can ask for anything and they will satisfy us. Even if we think of a new dish to make from scratch right at midnight.  Go check them out and try the mint tea"}
{"text":"It was disappointing for us. Turkish coffee was not a real Turkish coffee. It was Arabic coffee or something else. Chicken kabob had no flavor. Beyond these we found the server's hair on the meat. So I am so sorry that I have to rate them with one star after paying $70 for a dinner. With that much amount of money my expectations were higher."}
{"text":"I had mint tea and lentil soup here yesterday . It was delicious! I love the ambiance as well in the restaurant. I hope to enjoy a meal here again soon.    -                     Edit review 1/16/15 I came back to edit my initial 5 star review to 3.  I had a meal here again unfortunately the bill for the mint tea was quite high. I would not have ordered if I had known I was being charged each time. The price for tea was significantly higher than the price for the meal!  Warning: if you order a mint tea you maybe charged excessively for each pot!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. I ordered a chicken Shawarma plate, which by the way was huge. It was a very good size plate of the prices. I was amazed at how fresh the food tasted. The owner insisted I try the Restaurants signature Drink, the Lemon Mint Smoothing. It was very refreshing when i tasted the fresh mint.   The restaurant truly is beautiful in all aspects of food and culture. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place  authentic , food is good and i love the juices, good vibes and atmospheres, as well hookah  Definitely recommend to go there"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst mediterranean food i had in charlotte.   Here's the BAD  - Poor Service: We had to sit for 10 mins after being seated before the hostess asked asked us if we wanted menu's (I've never been asked if we wanted a menu in a  restaurant...we were always given one). We asked for water and were given bottled water and when we asked for regular water, we were given water cups with something white floating in them.  - Old & Reheated food: The falafel we ordered was 99% reheated in oil. You can make this out because when you gently press on it, oil will ooze out. The chicken had this weird smell like it had been cooked and was sitting in the fridge for a day or two and then again reheated.   - Way to expensive: 4 falafel's cost 4.99+ tax. A small side of plain rice is $5. Although this looks like one of your average mediterranean food joints, the prices are nothing like it. The prices are not indicative of the experience either. Just the opposite.   I literally cannot think of anything good about this place. My wife became sick after dinner.   I am not one to bad mouth a new restaurant but if they have any hopes of doings well, they have to improve all of their departments."}
{"text":"I make it a point to visit this place every time I am in Charlotte! Usually if you want good Mediterranean food or hookah you have to pick one or the other, but not here. The food here is amazing and I have yet to try anything I did not like. I personally would recommend the Kibbeh (ground beef pastry) for an appetizer and the lamb chops as an entree. The kitchen here is open until well past midnight, so it makes for a great late night option as well. I would also recommend one of their mixed drinks during your meal, my favorite is the fruit cocktails. They also have a wide array of pastries to try. The hookah here is top notch and they personally ensure every head is packed to perfection and constantly change out the coals and make sure the smoking experience does not degrade over time (as is natural at most places). Their new outdoor seating is great! Grab a coach, some of the delicious food, and a wonderful hookah."}
{"text":"Came here with my family a few days and was absolutely blown away by this restaurant....the food was phenomenal and the service was impeccable...came in for a graduation dinner with my family and everyone left with full stomachs and leftover plates. The food was seasoned to perfection....their lemon mint drink is out of this world!!!! I will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Love this place can't say enough good things about this place..awesome food , awesome hookahs awesome people, great atmosphere love this place highly highly recommended check it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I came to Charlotte for a visit from Toronto, and I was in the mood for some Mediterranean food and hookah. Albasha showed up in my search so I decided to try it. By far its one of the best restaurants I've been to that serve authentic Mediterranean food. I was offered a special named albasha Beyti kabob which was a Turkish delicacy. The food and service was amazing. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Charlotte with friends!"}
{"text":"Now this was a find!  I was actually trying to clear out some credits at restaurant.com when I stumbled across Al-Basha.  I sure am glad that I did!  Jenny and I cruised through six of the appetizers, and each one was a party in my mouth!  We both found ourselves grinning ear to ear with each bite.  I will have to keep coming back so I can work my way through the rest of the menu!  While we were there, we had the pleasure of meeting the Owners (father & son), and they couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful in guiding us through our choices.  Based on what I saw at another table, I can tell you that the Lamb Shanks are something you need to consider.  What a meal!  I can hardly wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I cannot begin to describe his amazing Al-Basha is! Not only is the hookah amazing but their food is to die for! I got char grilled chicken and the mint tea!  My hubby and I enjoyed the atmosphere, the service was amazing and the staff was super friendly! Can't wait to go back!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Lamb Mandi and lamb chops are out of this world! So tender and juicy, they just melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Dont be fooled on what you see from the outside. The inside is awesome. I was in Charlotte on a mini vacation and wanted to go to a middle eastern place that you could sit down with hookah and great food. Well guess what? I found it. It was on point so much so I went back twice.  The interior is not that great I will admit. But where they lack in appearance they make up for it in food and customer service. We stopped in the first time and only ordered a hookah and some beverages. Speaking of the beverages the watermelon juice was so good. I ordered 2! The hookah was on point as well. The price for the hookah is way cheaper then what I would have paid at home.   The second time that we went back we ordered the chicken kabob with rice. The chicken was so good and cooked to perfection. It was really tender and juicy. The rice was cooked perfectly. The service was  a bit slow from what I saw because there were only two people working but I was willing to look over that because they were really nice and accommodating.   If ever in Charlotte again I will only go to Al-Basha for hookah and middle eastern foods. I would say the same for you. I promise you will not be sorry,"}
{"text":"Very good food. We had many dishes, including hummus and pita, kibbeh, falafel, kafta, chicken shawarma -- all excellent. The service is friendly but a little unorganized. Once that is fixed, this will be a real gem of a place."}
{"text":"The best in all of the Charlotte area.  If you want authentic food and Hookah, this is the place to go.  I have been here several times and have never been disappointed.  I travel to the area and have taken several business associates here to experience a different flavor, they have all been very pleased.  Casual atmosphere, lots of locals playing cards, smoking and just hanging out.  Not a uptight or formal place."}
{"text":"So cute! Such a good atmosphere with a very family oriented service, it seem's like everyone that works there has known each other for the longest. The food is delicious and authentic- I recommend the shawarma!"}
{"text":"I love the place. Was really nice ReSturant and I love the service"}
{"text":"My kids love this place as much as I do. Great falafel and chicken shish kebab for them, hummus and baba ghanouj for me! Also appreciate the recent upgrades to the dining room. Wish they would play some music, though."}
{"text":"If you smoke hookah, and you're in Charlotte... this place is the go to. All I did here was smoke a mint hookah with my friend and we sat there for two hours. The only downside of this place is that if you smoke outside during the winter, well... it gets pretty cold.   They had plenty of seating for their outside hookah area. If you're here during the summer or spring, it would be perfect to be outside and smoke. However, if it's in the winter, then yeah you might be a little cold as there's no heat outside. Unless, well you bring your own. The owners here were very chill and welcoming which I think would make me want to come back.  I had a cappuccino and that was amazing, and when I paid for my check, I was definitely eying at their desserts it made me think that I should've ordered one. Sadly, I didn't so this is definitely on the plans the next time that I'm here.  All in all, this place is great and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best hookah bar i have been at in Charlotte NC. The customer service is amazing and food is amazing. First timers i would recommend come here and give it a shot. Overall best place to come to for unwinding."}
{"text":"The service had significantly improved since the last few times I been there. Katherine and Michele are the best servers I have seen in my life, they make sure you are satisfied and they keep checking on you every few minutes. The food is good and Michele makes the perfect hookah. They also upgraded the outdoor sitting which makes a perfect hangout place with friends. This is my usual hangout place now and I love being there as a customer."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was impressive.  This is definitely going to be my go to dinner spot when I come through Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had dinner here Valentines night. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and my husband got the Lamb Shank; for appetizer we had the Falafel. Our server, Kelly, was right on point and very friendly.  The food was good, not as highly seasoned as we would have liked, but enhanced enough to be genuine.  I've never had dark flat falafel but these were hot, crunchy and flavorful so that's a plus. When we return to Charlotte we will stop by for another meal to try some other specialties and because we forgot to order the soup.  P.S: Be sure to drop by and get a drink called The Cocktail to make your commute better."}
{"text":"Love the place. It's my Saturday night hangout. Amazing food (lamb/chicken shwarma is my go to meal) with a pot of hot Arab tea and a lemon mint frozen drink. This is a place where you go when you have time. Don't expect an American dining experience - its the middle east. You'll be there for a few hours!"}
{"text":"They use the good coals (coco nara). Not the crappy self lighting ones.  Staff is very friendly. Well definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I go here a lot. It's not so much by choice as it is lack of choice. There are few spots with outdoor seating that are open late. Since we play cards on Saturday and my friends smoke, we can't just go anywhere. Unfortunately, these guys have yet to learn how to provide customer service. It's been 4 years since I first came here and the same problems continue year after year. The food is mediocre, the hookah is complete trash, the seating is awful and the service is awful. I legit made a yelp account to bitch about Albasha. Example, today, our orders were taken 45 minutes after we came and our food took 30 minutes to make (all sandwiches). Some sandwiches came cold, some undercooked, and the fries were of course stale. But after waiting an hour and fifteen minutes to eat I'm just glad you acknowledged that I'm a customer.  I love the owner and his kids and the workers, but they have deep rooted problems in the way they run this restaurant that probably won't go away anytime soon. I will officially stop my weekly patronage here and look for a new spot until they've, at the very least, fixed their customers service. I'm willing to put up with all their problems if I didn't feel so damn disrespected whenever I go."}
{"text":"Here are the top 5 on my personal Al-basha bucket list: 1) Smoke Al Fakher Tobacco Hookah ($10.99), Disposable hose ($2.49), Refill ($4.99). The best hole in the wall in great Charlotte area.   2) Eat a chicken shawarma wrap ($5.95). Delicious! 3) Drink a pot of tea with fresh Mint ($4.95). Refreshing. 4) Listen to traditional and new arabic music. Relaxing. 5) Keep relaxing and repeat.  Kudos to Michelle, Josh and Deja for running the show and putting up with the customers.  Four and half Yelps."}
{"text":"Solid Mediterranean food - a good find in Charlotte, where pickings are kind of slim in this category! Very tasty hummus and falafel. Very friendly owner and server when we stopped in for a takeout order. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good. We've had almost everything off the menu and loved it all. The staff is so caring and attentive. We have brought all of our friends here and they all love it. The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. Don't pass by this place without trying it!!"}
{"text":"Place needs a serious makeover. Service slow no knowledge of being a waiter or waitress. Just deliver the food. Was good nothing special. Price to high. 1 word. RENOVATION"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! What a hidden gem! I was looking for an authentic hookah spot and discovered this magical beauty. At first, we thought it was too bright inside and nobody was in there. But once we went to the side, the patio was pumping!The manager and waitress Michelle were top-notch and treated us like VIP- because we are!   I wanted to give them 5 stars before we were even seated at our table. That's how attentive they were! It has a nice outdoor patio- great for beautiful nights and vibing with friends.   Food was delicious- the most satisfying meal in a while and affordable priced! I think the chefs are from Turkey & Egypt! Great company, delicious foods & hookah, nice chill summer drink, and the workers checked up on us frequently to make sure we were good!  The best customer service experience in Charlotte! Go there! Be open and make new friends"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some family and it was really delicious! The appetizers were amazing. We ordered falafel, hummus and kuba. Definitely would go back and order those three items off the menu! The service was really great and the chef came out to check on us, which was a nice personal touch.   If you are looking to try a refreshing drink this summer, would highly suggest ordering the mint lemonade. Wow!! So refreshing, sweet and sour, perfect for a sunny day.   The chicken shawirma on top of my fatoosh salad was okay, wasn't my absolute favorite but wasn't bad either. Needed a bit more flavor so I requested a side of taheeni sauce which really did the trick.  The restaurant itself isn't super fancy or anything but it definitely has a welcoming feel to it. The outdoor seating for hookah seemed spacious and cozy, even though we were just there for dinner."}
{"text":"This place has the best mediterranean food with the best prices. It's very family orientated with a welcoming and casual atmosphere. The kabab was delicious and lasted for dinner and lunch the next day! The moroccan pastries and tea were definitely worth it. I would recommend this place. For sure the best for the price."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment while on trip.  Food was great and service was exceptional.  Owners went out of their way to make sure that my visit was fantastic.  Great mix of shisha and owners were very creative.  What was most impressive is that the owners wanted to make sure that my visit was as positive as it could be.  They succeeded and I will visit the next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Im excessively judgmental about hookha because I smoke it everyday, that being said this place truly won me over. There expertise on making hookha will make u come everyday. Everyone living in NC should come and try there hookha. I don't think I hav had a better hookha in NC than from this place also there Moroccan tea ( which is must have when smoking a hookha ) . Everyone who comes to Charlotte must drop by this place and experience it themselves I am sure they won't be disappointed. There service is also great and they r very friendly.  This place is crowded on Saturday."}
{"text":"Eh.... not so good. Sat down and noticed the other patrons were smoking hookah and drinking tea, but no eating. Now I know why. Horribly overlooked lamb. Not one dish that was better than passable. I was going to go to La Shishkabab next door which is alway great. I thought I'd try something new. Never, Ever, again!"}
{"text":"Great place for hookah. Our server Michelle was so knowledgeable and really into making sure we had a great hookah experience. She took the time to learn our preferences and then to mix up a tobacco mix that we would like along with limes and mint in the water. It was a cool day and we date outside on the comfy furniture in the sun and enjoyed hot tea wit mint. This is a true middle eastern hookah experience and located near a couple of halal stores. The food here looks good as well but we didn't eat here. The interior is under some sort of remodeling."}
{"text":"Very very good food I had the chicken shawarma and it was the best ive had in Charlotte so far. Great service! My concern is the cleanliness though. Don't want to bad mouth a wonderful restaurant with delicious food but maybe a good scrub down to the inside and outside? Maybe some washable removable slip covers for couches too and it'll look like new!"}
