{"text":"My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day and the service was terrible! It appeared that they were understaffed, and our waitress was dripping sweat and musty smelling. It took approximately 20 minutes to just get water once we sat down. It was 1/2 price sushi night, which was a great perk, but when we asked for a box to take home our leftovers we were told that we couldn't take home the 1/2 price sushi. We complained and said that we were unaware of this policy, as it wasn't stated anywhere in the menu. The waitress who was apparently terrified of the manager threw a plastic bag on our table and asked us to put the sushi in there and hide it, so she wouldn't get in trouble (yes she literally threw the bag on our table as she ran past!). My husband had also ordered an entree, but cancelled the order because by now we were already done eating, and had been waiting another 20+ minutes for the check. The waitress actually tried to bribe us by saying that if we still got this entree she would let us take the sushi home. Although the sushi was good....I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"BY FAR THE WORST CHINESE FOOD OR QUITE POSSIBLY FOOD IN GENERAL THAT I HAVE EVER HAD! I should have guessed that by the lack of customers but I had ordered carry out and it was too late by that time. Also the weather was bad so I thought that maybe that was the reason ther was nobody there. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and got the dinner for two. On the drive home she had horrible cramping followed by a desperate run to the toilet. We went back a month later and got the half price sushi. This time on the way home I was cursed by the cramping and desperate run to the bathroom. Never again."}
{"text":"ok i have lived in california for a period of time. i am use to the more ethnic flavors and going into a place to eat where the menus did not have one lick of english on them.  forks and spoons were a special request.. this place is very good. considering its on ohio. one of the best places i have been to. if you want a close taste to what asian food should be like go here. i read the reviews and was so sad for what other people who have never tasted the real thing thought. the hot and sour soup was not sweet yeah, not as hot and eye watering as i have had it before but for ohio the best i have had so far, good job, the crab ragoon was not sweet either. thank you for not falling into american ideals. i got sushi which was awsome. i chose the eel cause it is my fav.  which was just so good they do have a few sushi items with cream cheese. but i guess they have to cater to those who have no clue. but i i stayed away from those because i know better.  what i did order was great.   the staff was great.  this place was empty when i showed up which was a shame because if you want something close to real asian food you should eat here. not what what has been adapted for american taste. i noticed most ppl from out of state gave it higher reviews. trust in them.  this place is really good."}
{"text":"There were a few things that could make this place great, and some things that could not change.  The best thing about this place is that it is warming and very friendly. I enjoyed the food though it was very Americanized. The portions were big and very filling, leaving a lot to take home which is always good. I say it is a good bang for your buck! I came with 3 other people and the food arrived promptly. The server was very fast giving us refills and the check when we were done. The aesthetics are pleasing also.  That brings me to the next point... The menus were pretty dirty and sticky, and so were the glasses. No traditional music was playing and I just didn't feel like I was actually at a Chinese restraunt.  Besides some stuff being sticky, dirty, and no tradition music was playing everything else was great.  I will return Tuesday for the half off sushi, I can't wait to try it out!  One more edit: The atmosphere is cool, but there isn't many people here...I think the only reason for that is location."}
{"text":"This place used to be SO GOOD.  Sadly over the past few years its really not stood up to previous visits.  The sushi was always fresh, but no longer.  The dinners were seasoned well and presented nicely, but recently they have been over salted and kind of sloppy.  Not sure what happened, but its been months since we've visited and I dont think we will return."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, as I work right down the street, and usually it is ok.  But today was absolutely terrible.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, white rice and a veggie egg roll.  My co-worker ordered sushi, and lettuce wraps -- her food was very good! Mine on the other hand was absolutely terrible - I asked the waitress if she maybe mixed up my order with the next table because she brought out our orders together.  What I had tasted was NOT chicken, I was thinking maybe it was the sweet and sour pork - but it had a \"fishy\" taste - I told her it was not eatable - That the \"chicken\" I was eating was dark and chewy and really hard to eat - I tried a couple pieces and had to spit them out into my napkin.    She turned to me and confirmed that it was in fact chicken, and that she was sorry - then she dropped off our check and never came back.  I left the restaurant only eating the steamed rice on my plate and the veggie roll (which was good).  I'm so disappointed in the food this trip, but what compelled me to write the review was the poor treatment and terrible customer service.  No wonder why the place is always empty!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place stays in business other than the Half Price sushi deal on Tuesdays. Sushi is decent for the price (on Tuesday), wonton soup was pretty good. Everything else is basically no better than greasy Chinese take out food. We ordered the Kun Pow Tofu which was absolutely flavorless, just spicy heat without taste. The tofu tasted like it had been fried ahead of time and then thrown into the vegetables and what they call 'sauce' (read: cornstarch and cayenne pepper.) Thai Basil Chicken was a little better, but not much. Still lacking flavor, drowning in cornstarch, but still better than the Kun Pow. Vegetarian Pad Thai and Fried Rice are better choices. Skip this one and get take out from one of the hundreds of Chinese places in the area."}
{"text":"and i quote...  \"...woah.  but i don't get it.  where's the buffet?  why doesn't the air feel heavy with grease?\"  trip 2 to the wild ginger.  am i hitting it on off peak times?  or do they just never have a huge crowd here?  and if it's the latter, it's not for the sake of the food.  the food is good.  no, it's not greasy.  nope, it's not a buffet (as my friend joked).  and though it's set a bit farther back from the road than its other munchtastic companions, you can't pass up the wild ginger.    they have a decent lunch menu, and for half the price you get a huge portion of almost any of the entrees on the menu, plus rice and soup.  i'm normally not a big soup fan, but wild ginger has really great soup.  so far i've only had the egg drop and the won ton, but i think their won ton surpasses any i've had before.  how's that for complimentary?  awwwww snap!  if you've followed my yelpin' in the past, you'll know i'm not a sushi girl.  however, their sushi seems to be a hit with all my fish lovin' friends i have.  one friend just kept ordering more and more and more.  i mean, it can't be bad if he's gonna chow like there's no tomorrow.  the drink menu is pretty big as well, though i would not recommend the green tea martini.  i thought it'd be interestingly amazing.  sadly, it was interestingly and amazingly yacktastic.  big portions, not too expensive, friendly staff.  and never seems to be a crowd.  i'm not sure why.   but i'd check this place out.  their menu is gigantic, so you're bound to find something that doesn't suck.  i have.  twice.  so the odds are so far non-suck- 2.  suck-0.   that's a better record than any clevo sports teams.  i say that like i keep up with that crap....."}
{"text":"Great place.  Good customer service.  Not so much people when I came here.  However, it's a hard place to find because it's behind everything.  Food's good.  Mongolian Beef rocks!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!  We ordered from Food Fetchers tonight. The pictures on the website and on yelp look so NICE. This definitely seemed like a P.F. Chang's stepchild. Not that I've ever been to P.F. Chang's. But whatever. It seemed nice, and a little unconventional, with several different Asian cuisines available. (I would have liked to have tried the sushi, as I am always on the lookout for good sushi in the Cleve, but I have a strict no-takeout sushi policy. I could explain that, but i won't.)  I ordered my go-to meal I always have when trying a new place, for the comparison factor : wonton soup and chicken with broccoli. Bo-ring!  The soup gets a 2.5. There was tons of crap in it, and unnecessary crap at that. I don't want greens in my soup! Was it seaweed? Or kale? I dunno. There were too many scallions. The broth wasn't flavorful enough. The meat in the wontons was weird. Etc.  However, the chicken with broccoli gets a 5! Delicious and plentiful. It had white sauce, but no carrots or water chestnuts (gag!), for which I was thankful. Also, the rice was steamed perfectly. No hard and crunchy rice here.  My husband had lettuce wraps, which LOOKED dumb (iceberg? Really?) but tasted GREAT! And he also had a really healthy and good looking salad, the jerk. Making me feel bad about myself.  All in all, very good! Very fresh tasting, not greasy in the least. It seemed....what?!...healthy. I'll take it."}
{"text":"A wonderful spot for lunch. The selection is good. The place is very clean and the staff is on top of it!  The are just behind Crackwhore Barrel."}
{"text":"I came here on half priced sushi night.  I appreciated that it was inexpensive and I was actually able to get a table.  It really wasn't anything special though.  A little of a disappointment after just eating at Sushi Rock two nights before.  If it weren't for that perhaps I would've liked it more.  I was also a little disappointed on the lack of choices in sushi.  I wanted a little more.  The one roll that I really did enjoy a lot was the spicy beef.  They have a wide variety of other things on their menu which is awesome, but I didn't have the chance to sample too much.  I did have the vegetable tempura and dumplings and was disappointed in both.  Both seemed kind of greesy.  I'd give it another try though."}
{"text":"I've now been here three times.  The food is okay but the service seems to be very, very slow.  Today I went with 7 girlfriends for an anti-Valentine's Day dinner.  They didn't have enough menus to give to everyone.  Each time I've gotten the same thing: An order of the worlds smallest crab rangoon and the honey pecan chicken.  At the risk of sounding like a size queen, the crab rangoon are VERY small in my opinion and have little filling.  The honey pecan chicken is good.  The one highlight is the plum wine.  Yum!  I'm sure I'll be back...and when I do go back, I'm sure I'll question why I did...  *sigh* ...the story of my life."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. We ended up only eating a few bites and leaving because the gnata were so bad. The booth across from us complained about the gnats and left, as soon as our food came out we were swarmed with gnats. We ate a few bites but lost our appetite and didn't take the left overs. Nice waitress, but won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrid food!!!  I shouldn't have to add a TBSP of soy sauce to my food so that I can actually taste it.  Me and husband are actually a little worried that we could get food poisoning here.  The tables and floor were dirty.  And the food lacked any flavor.  I didn't mind that we were the only ones here...  But I would at least enjoy some flavor in my food.  We ended up ordering: Chicken lettuce wraps Szechwan chicken Mongolian beef"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice here.  I came on a sunday for lunch - very quiet.  The veggie egg roll was very old school (thick) but done right.  The Kung Pow was okay.  All in all it was very mediocre take-out type chinese food.  I hope someone can point me to better."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with a couple of friends who recommended the place.  We went on a Tuesday for the half-price sushi and were disappointed.    The service was really bad.  There were large delays between sitting down and ordering drinks and between ordering our drinks and actually getting them and then between getting our drinks and ordering our food and then ordering our food and actually getting our food.  Even after waiting nearly 30 minutes for our food to come, my wife still got her food about five minutes after the rest of us.  I have only been to a couple of sushi places on their half-price night, but this was the only one where \"half-price\" also meant \"half-the-fish\".  I'm talking seriously meager portions.  Another strike against them came when I realized their Philly roll wasn't even made with smoked salmon (they used imitation crab).  Philly rolls are one of my favorites, so I was kind of bummed.  Meh."}
{"text":"Wild Ginger is a great little restaurant, tucked away out of sight. I honestly don't know how it can stay open, because it seems like there's never anybody there. But it's a lucky thing it's open for those of us who know it, because it's a great choice when you have a taste for some Chinese food. Best fried rice I've ever had!   The service is wonderful at Wild Ginger. After a couple of visits, the server came to know my boyfriend and I, and always remembers what we like! She also let us in on a secret about the best table in the restaurant, and depending on what time you go to eat, it's a perfect spot to watch the sun set. Beautiful sights and really good food. Plus the servings of food are always huge, so I always have leftovers to enjoy the next day! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Average at best. There's nothing that really stood out, but I wasn't expecting much from an Asian restaurant located off the highway exit to one of Cleveland's inner-ring suburbs."}
{"text":"If this restaurant were in a different location people would flock to it specifically for their sushi. Sadly its surrounded by chain fast foods places (cracker barrel, chipotle, steak n shake, panera and more) so its always a dead atmosphere. The dynamite roll was seriously delicious. My boyfriend had the pad thai and wasn't very impressed as it was a little \"too saucy\" and the sauce itself was a little watery. Otherwise, I will definitely go back - for the sushi if nothing else."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here awhile back and I've never returned every single item we ordered before! Appetizer and entrees, it was all inedible. Normally I can throw gross food away at home but I HAD to tell them how horrible it was."}
{"text":"Please, someone tell me how in the world this place stays in business?  I've been here a few times and always seem to be the only person dining here.  Unless it's a front for a mob operation, or they do a killer drive/thru & carry out service, I just don't see how they are still around.  I mean the food is decent, heck for this town it's amazing Chinese food.  I'm highly skeptical of their sushi, I just don't see how they could cycle through enough of it to be fresh.  Otherwise, I'd return, I'd just hope others would be there."}
{"text":"Always good service, great food-special kudos to Amanda, who always makes you feel welcome with a nice hello..."}
{"text":"War Sui Gai is best I have had in years.  This was my first visit and I am impressed, definately will be returning and telling everyone I know to go there as we were just discussing that there  are no good places anymore for Chinese food.  This is the place to go! Linda"}
{"text":"In the great tradition of Chinese food during the holidays we went to catch a bite late Christmas Eve. Admittedly the resturant only had two 10+ parties but they mercifully stayed open. This place does the whole gambit of Asian cuisine well; pad thia, sushi, Singapore noodles, salmon ragoon, and General Taos chichen. It seems that every dish had that extra something to elivate it to the very good level. The ever flowing pots of tea were also a respite from a cold windy night."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Cleveland area. This place is a must try for Asian Cuisine. The food is great, service is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. If you haven't tried this place; you really need to. If you've been here before; what are you waiting for hurry up and come on back."}
{"text":"Food is so fresh...not like most chinese restaurants.  Great sushi and chinese food. They will pretty much make anything you ask. Wish they had delivery though"}
{"text":"My only concern is this place might not last in this economy.  I've been there several times and there is more staff than customers. The menu is bigger than Sushi Rock or Sunset Lounge and yet.....its empty.  I'm aware than the nightlife of West 6th pales in comparison to Tiedman road hotspots such as The Icehouse and TGI Fridays....but Wild Ginger is a good sushi place for half the price.  Tuesday nights are HALF price sushi night from 5 till close (9:30).  With the small crowds, you only wait like 15 minutes for several sushi rolls...unlike Sunset or S. Rock where it can be up to 45 minutes or longer.  All I'm saying is check it out on a Tuesday if you like sushi and you will be very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Wow.  I don't know how this place even stays open! The food here is so lousy & it hasn't always been that way. I remember going here during the first year it was open & the food was very good. It started to go downhill since then. The service is very slow too which I don't understand because there's nobody even here in a Saturday night! Not only that, the dishes don't come out all at the same time. You have to wait 10 or so mins to get each dish it seemed like. Don't bother getting anything with seafood in it because it won't be fresh."}
{"text":"This place used to be so delicious. My brother and I walked in and it was dead. No servers, bartender overworked and we waited 30minutes just to take our order at the bar thinking it would be faster. Highly disappointed. we ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"Half priced sushi on Tuesdays from 5-close!! That's what got me to enter. They have two vegetarian and vegan friendly rolls - pretty standard stuff. Sushi service is a little slow, but I guess it's labor intensive. The plum wine makes the wait time fly by. Haven't tried any of the entrees yet, there do appear to be a lot for the veg's to choose from."}
{"text":"Went back  recently for an early dinner. About 4pm. Place was empty. Food was as good as always!! I got Szechuan green beans and it was dynamite! The only reason for 4/5 was since we were the only ppl there the flies wouldn't leave us alone."}
{"text":"Omgosh!!!! The food was not to live for but the sushi was!!!!! The dishes were not clean and the waiter was too old to be waiting tables. The greeters clothes were dirty but I like how involved she was with making sure we got something delicious. We did...the sushi."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than 1 star for this place. First, we pulled in and there were only two other Cars in the parking lot. The patio was full of rusty overturned chairs so we couldn't eat outside. My girlfriend and I ordered 2 waters which had a metallic taste to it. Then I ordered a green tea martini, which they said that they were unable to make due to the fact that \"nobody liked it\" so they got rid of the green tea liquor. We then ordered 3 sushi rolls for half off sushi night. Once they came out, we each tried a piece of the shrimp tempura roll. The shrimp tasted like it was fried last week due to the fact that it was hard as a rock. We then tried the eel which was entirely skin and no meat. We also both noticed that nothing was very cold. It was all at room temperature, the rice tasted old, and the seafood had a bad aroma to it. After 20 minutes our server finally came over and we told her that everything was inedible. She said \"Okay\" and took our plates away. After waiting 10 more minutes, we got 2 fortune cookies.  The manager never stopped over and apologized, and neither did the server. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"A nifty little Asian place hidden behind the usual chain joints in Brooklyn (where my girl was raised...however, I represent Queens). Huge selection, friendly staff, good drink specials. I got the lo mien, and it was far, far beyond the usual rubbery shizzle that passes for lo mien in most restaurants. On a Thursday night, it was surprisingly dead, but this place is a welcome and unexpected surprise."}
{"text":"Used to be a good little spot, but is now unrecognizably bad--we will never be back.  Met a friend for lunch around 11:30 today and we were the only ones there. The server didn't greet us, just walked up and complained how much her back hurt and how she had been thinking of calling off.  Okay...  As soon as we sat down, we were attacked by gnats--the ones that weren't already dead with the flies on the windowsill (gross)--and they divebombed us the entire time. Speaking of time, it took so long until we had any food at all, even though we were the only ones in there.  The food was not up to par, not by a long shot. It used to be so good, but the sushi was meh, the shrimp chips were stale, the fried rice had no taste, and the Thai peanut noodles were watery.   As we looked around, we could see that the floors around us had not been cleaned the night before, which--adding to the persistent gnat situation--lent an air of abject  uncleanliness to the place.   We now have to find a new spot to meet for lunch, because there is no way either of us will ever be back. We miss the way Wild Ginger was a few years ago, because this new version is filthy with bland food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the pad Thai and it was really spot on. The jasmine tea is Devine and the chicken dumplings were also great. Some of the best miso soup I've tasted in awhile. Service was quite slow but as they have a sign out looking for a new server, I will not let it reflect too hard on the score :)"}
{"text":"I love Wild Ginger, despite all their faults. Yes, it is always empty. Yes, the service is slow. And yes the service is slow, including if you order take out. But the food is fantastic for what it is.   Yes, it's typical Americanized Chinese food. You're not going to find traditional Chinese food here and honestly I'm unsure if there are any restaurants like that in our area.   The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful inside. Rice lanterns everywhere and it's very modern and clean.   To me, the food is hit or miss but the stuff that is a hit is really good! Their general tso's and sweet and sour chicken are both really good, and I love their fried rice - It has an interesting sweet taste to it. The dumplings, both fried and steamed, are awesome and their wonton soup is the best I've had.   Their chicken lo mein has a good flavor but is so overwhelmingly greasy I find it hard to eat. And their egg rolls are honestly the worst I've ever had and too heavy of a hand on the pepper.   All in all, it's my favorite Chinese joint. Yes, it's typical american style Chinese, but it's better quality and taste than your average take out joint."}
{"text":"I read a fair amount of negative reviews about dining experiences here, so I went into Wild Ginger cautiously but boy am I glad I did!   We were greeted promptly by the staff, we sat at the sushi bar and our server brought us drinks immediately. The sushi chef and staff were very friendly.   The place was empty besides us but it was Sunday around 3pm not exactly prime dinner hour.   We ordered the Spicy Maki Combo, spicy crab roll, and shrimp tempura rolls.  I'll add that Spicy Crab is not on the menu but they were more than happy to make the Spicy rendition for us.  The food was great, everything tastes fresh and I loved the spicy salmon roll.  Definitely will return again when I'm craving some sushi!"}
{"text":"Our family goes here after church at least once a month.  Each time we go, it's not busy, but that's a plus because we get great food and great service.  They have a big menu and so far everything we have tried has been very good.  This time we tried the sushi and I even liked that.  Everything is fresh and cooked to order.  Good fried rice(which always determines if it is worthy of being good) and egg rolls.  The hot mustard will light your nose up, but it's outstanding.  If you are afraid because you don't see any cars, try it anyway, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered sushi to go and the salmon in the rolls was a really dark red, turning grey. It just wasn't the \"right\" color for fresh salmon in sushi.  This kinda ruined it for me as I don't feel I can trust the place now. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"1.5 stars. Meh, I've experienced way better.  After finding that the Korean and sushi place in Parma were closed on Sundays (why oh why???), we quickly looked on Yelp, looking for an Asian place to go. Having passed Wild Ginger by the entrance of the freeway before, I said, why not? And off we went.  It's a nice restaurant- not your typical authentic Chinese restaurant which is usually small and kind of dirty. Also, their food wasn't very authentic at all. Sigh. I don't even know why I had hopes it might be good.  First, my friend ordered all calamari. It was completely a deep fried ...... thing. None of us couldn't even find the calamari in these big pieces of deep friedness. Bleh bleh.  Next the entrees:  Singapore noodles: Usually I love singapore noodles. But man, here.... it wasn't flavorful and just kind of...blah.   Sesame Prawns and Scallops: That actually was okay. Still..... not authentic, but that was alright.  Chow fun- um no. I'm Canto- and those were NOT Cantonese noodles. The noodles were these weird skinny consistency, and it seemed like they cooked with dow see. I mean, I love dow see, and I like it with the fish in the can it comes with, but...ummm....on chow fun? I think not.  The service was rather slow- and there was only one other party in the entire restaurant at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. And our water wasn't getting refilled. Boo.  Yeah, not a fan. Maybe if you like the non-traditional stuff, go ahead...but if you like authentic Chinese places, this is not the place to go. I should have known when she started recommending the General Tso's chicken (which is NOT a typical Canto dish, by the way....ugh)."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Traveling through from California and this place treated us very well. The price is right and they give you plenty of great dishes. We had the Dinner for two, and it had egg rolls, boneless pork ribs, and the crab wonton. The soup was wonton and it was a bowl that was very good. Sweet and sour pork was very good, so was the chop suey.  Freindly staff, and a good wine selection, i wouldnt pass this place up. Hey, $13 dollars per person, I wasn't expecting much, I was very suprised!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: The excuses continue to pour in. Everything from \"We can't buy the right ingredients here!\" to \"Okinawa is under Japanese control, so the historical relationship between than island and CHINA doesn't matter!\"  Scroll down the page and take a look at every comment that mentions a negative feature of this restaurant. You'll find the owner making excuses, and if you dare venture back to their empty parking lot to try again, you'll find things in the same state. Servers sitting around, chairs empty, and an owner that can't own up to the things that are wrong with the service.   Save yourself the frustration and hit Panda Express. At least your expectations will be met."}
{"text":"I gave this place four chances. I really wanted to like it, mostly just because it's so close to my house. The last visit: I ordered a Philadelphia roll. Instead of the typical smoked salmon / cream cheese, they served it with fake crab meat / cream cheese. Maybe they were out of smoked salmon, I don't know. Not cool. A warning would have been nice, that way I could have ordered something else. It was lunchtime on a Saturday. I ordered a bottle of plum wine for the two of us. The server brought it to us seconds after bringing us our meal, despite having ordered it when we sat down (okay okay, maybe she had a hard time finding it or something)..... She put the bottle down on the table, unopened. I opened and poured. Halfway through our first glasses, she dropped the checks. Apparently her shift was over or something. This visit was the last attempt to dine here. Down the street, find Mizu sushi.... Much better quality for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent food all around! We had a little bit of everything - and nothing disappointed us. We had sushi - excellent flavors, perfectly presented. Vegetarian egg rolls - perfect. Chicken with noodles that we asked to be mildly spicy - my mouth still drools thinking about it. Definitely go - it's worth the price."}
