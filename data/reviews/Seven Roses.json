{"text":"I had not eaten there in about a year, was looking forward to returning.  As always the food was fantastic.  I read the reviews and every one said all they had to pay was $10.50.  That woman told me $15 bucks each, I said   WHAT !   I was blown away.  Today was my treat, I am not use to spending $30 for lunch.   Buyer beware."}
{"text":"They accommodated me even though I was a little late coming in but 6pm does seem to be an odd time to close the buffet. The service and food were both very good, especially for the price. I had access the the remenents of the buffet which were still edible and what I assume it the \"usual combo\" Perogies, potato pancakes, stuffed cabbage and soup. Everything except the soup excited my buds.  What stands out the most to me about the experience was all the polish speech bouncing around. There was a tv playing a soap opera comedy, which would have really turned me off, but it was a Polish soap opera comedy, with a cheesy muscle bound man dressed up as a robot with a motocross helmet that was two sizes too small for his little head.... I know it has nothing to do with the food, but that did tickle me.  On my way out I bought one of each of the Polish chocolate candies. Really interesting sweets. I ate them down by the Cuyahoga, the river known for catching fire."}
{"text":"Reviews peeked my interest.  Stopped by for an early lunch, Sunday, first impressions not good as flies were present as soon as you entered the building landing on open trays of bakery.  Then come to find out it was only a buffet setting.  Information on the web shows a menu. Ladies behind the counter friendly but not helpful....plenty of open seats, for 14.95 I was not impressed with the buffet with or without the flies.  I will not be stopping back."}
{"text":"First: If you look on Google Maps for this restaurant, it will show its location on Fleet Ave. and say \"This place has closed or relocated.\" That is not true.  Second: Come for the food, not the decor/atmosphere. If I were grading the decor, the score would be 2 stars.   Third: The authentic Polish food is very good. Perogi, stuffed cabbage, mashed potatoes, soup,, kielbasa, potato pancake, all delicious. They are considered a deli also, but when I was there for lunch everyone was eating the buffet."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious Polish buffet for only $10.50!  This is like eating at my grandmother's house...potato pancakes brought fresh to the table, pierogies, cabbage and noodles, kielbasa, chicken, stuffed cabbage, are all included!  You can't beat the quality and flavor for the price!  Take home kielbasa, soups, pierogies and Polish bakery from the deli counter.  Don't miss it.  This is Cleveland!"}
{"text":"It was a fun experience, but we won't be back, for the restaurant at least.    We came for the lunch buffet on a Saturday around noon.  I think we were the first customers of the day because nothing was out.  The service was friendly, but the women working seemed very frazzled and a bit surprised to have to serve 4 tables at once.  They brought pierogies, potato pancakes, soup, and cookies to our table.  The buffet had 2 types of chicken, mashed potato, cabbage rolls, sausage & kraut, cabbage & noodles, vegetables, and spaghetti.  Everyone was able to find something they loved, but no one liked everything.    I got some items from the bakery and she said the total for everything (4 adults, 1 child, and 1 baby) was $130 (no itemized receipt).   I thought that was a bit much, but now that I see the buffet was supposed to be only $12, I have no idea what I actually paid for.  Hopefully another table got a free lunch on me!  They have a sign saying they accept credit cards, but I was told the machine was not working.  The cheesecake I got from the bakery was phenomenal.  The woman checking us out said she makes the cheese herself.  I might have to go back someday just for this."}
{"text":"Great Polish food! The Fleet Avenue streetscape construction is underway, but they are open 11-5pm. Help them get through the construction and check it out!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Went on Sunday at 11:00am. Did the buffet. My daughters watched as folks came in and said \"everyone seems like family.\" Crazy cheap. Great perogies, schnitzel, and kielbasa. A real experience. Super friendly. A great place to take kids."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for months, so very disappointed for what transpired. Went with my friend Lisa today. I called earlier and asked how late the lunch buffet was?...she said 3pm. I asked how much?...she said $11.99. We got there about 2:35pm. Said we wanted the buffet. She said have a seat and we'll fix you something (we were the only 2 customers there.) 2 other men were there they seem to know.  No menu or explanation of what was about to happen. She brings 2 cups of soup. My friend said oh I didn't get a chance to say but I'm vegan. She said I'll just have water just leaving me to be the only one to eat. They tried to offer her a few things but realized that even the simplest thing at least had dairy in it. Then I got a potato cake (had to ask for sour cream) I had to ask for my pop twice...then it was brought with a glass (no ice) and a can of pop (I had to ask for ice.) I wanted a glass of water too but never got the chance to ask so my friend gave me hers since I was the one eating. I shared my pop with her. Then I got my main plate given to me (no buffet)  2 stuffed cabbages, mashed potatoes and gravy, 3 meatballs, one kinda cool barbecue rib, and 3 pierogies. And then two cookies dropped off later.  We were there over 2 hrs talking and so were the sisters that worked there/own it? One talking with the 2 men in Polish. No one ever came back to offer a water refill another pop or to clear a plate. We were ready to go and I asked for the check. She said I'll take care of that at the front. She then said the bill was $14.99. I go to pay it and my friend insisted it was her treat. I wanted to ask about the $11.99 that was now magically $14.99. (Even to add a can of pop, a can of pop doesn't cost $3 bucks.) My friend is the type to just pay it and move on. She gave the woman a $20 and said keep the change. I could've lost it. With that service no way did they deserve $5 bucks! I got an over inflated buffet price and no buffet and frankly sh!tty service. I WILL NEVER EVER IN LIFE GO BACK. I didn't like the switch-a-rue price for the buffet that I never even got. Was never asked would I like anything else or seconds. AWFUL SERVICE. We would've been better off going to McDonald's and sitting at the park. Food tasted fine but with that nonchalant service and not getting what was asked and paid for. WHAT A STRANGE WAY TO DO BUSINESS! Seat your customer then serve them what you want and then charge them $15 bucks for lunch! I just can't get over my experience here. I'LL NEVER GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"One of the best values in Cleveland, and great quality home cooking.  Note the hours, sometimes I call first before going just to ensure they are open as they do close very early.   The buffet has a nice variety, it is all home cooked and high quality.  Stuffed cabbage, kielbasa are always superb and they usually have at least one American item on the buffet (which I generally skip since their Polish items are so great).   As you are partially done with your meal, the server will bring out a freshly made potato pancake and some homemade soup-- both are superb and a highlight to the meal.  I almost never leave the place without getting some fresh bakery for the next morning's breakfast and have never been disappointed, again top quality.  The store area in the front has a nice variety of imported items, also some of their home made soups/pierogies to take home.   Love coming here, if it is a Saturday lunch, I'm guaranteed I will not need dinner that night and that i'll also have some home made bakery items for Sunday breakfast.  Cash only, no credit cards.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here. I'm familiar with Seven Roses since they're at Cleveland's Oktoberfest every year, and at Oktoberfest it is Der Braumeister and Seven Roses that have the longest lines. It's a buffet, but you can get frozen pierogies and such to take home. I love their kielbasi ... Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Cash only!  I am glad I read yelp reviews before I went otherwise I would have been totally confused.  They do not have a menu, it's a buffet with extras delivered to your table.  They served us mushroom soup to start and then we headed to the buffet which had (sorry I don't know Polish terms) cabbage rolls, a goulash, spaetzel, some veggie thing, and a potato bacon loaf.  While we were eating they served us very delicious potato pancakes and perogies.  And just when we thought we were done they brought out an apple strudel dessert.  This place is easy to pass by since it doesn't have the name on the outside of the building, there is just a tarp that says Polish Restaurant."}
{"text":"4 stars for our first visit!   This place is amazing. Seven Roses is located in the Slavic Village, a historic neighborhood with recent attempts of turning around. The Eastern European enclaves in Cleveland are so interesting and cool. Seven Roses has a lot of customers that speak their native Eastern European languages, and many of the staff here don't speak English.   Seven Roses is mostly a lunch place. It closes at 6pm during the weekdays during the wintertime, as we soon found out one evening. We went again on Saturday for the Polish buffet lunch, and it was amazing.  Some of the best things were the stuffed cabbage and potato pancakes. Mmm mmm good. My friend, who has an Eastern European heritage, said that it was the best stuffed cabbage and it stood out from the others in Cleveland because it had a homemade taste. We had heard about their pierogies from a barber in Steelyard, so we ordered a plate full of them. They were handmade (amazing) and they were sooo delicious!   The front part of the restaurant is a Polish store, complete with bacon and deli meats. The back part of the restaurant seems to also be convertible into a party area. It's definitely a homely restaurant with a family-owned feel.   When we were wrapping up our meal, we looked at each other and agreed that this wouldn't be our last time eating here!"}
{"text":"This place, Seven Roses, is hilarious, but in a good way.  It's a down-home Polish buffet in the city's Slavic Village which, at one time, may be have been very Slavic but appears to be less so today.  It's down the street, meaning Fleet Avenue, from that big red brick Catholic church, most likely the mainstay of the strong ethnic community that was once here.  So, you park your car out front or on a side street, and go into Seven Roses, also spelled in Polish on its signage.   Initially, you are in a grocery store.  If you keep going forward, you'll head into the restaurant portion where there is a menu but Seven Roses is mostly known for their lunch buffet.  The buffet doesn't have a lot of choices, but it has what you need: pierogi, stuffed cabbage, sausage, chicken, vegetables, etc.  I have been twice and the first time was a little better because they had these very tasty mini salisbury steaks on the buffet line.  Apart from the items on the buffet line, they will also bring you out some soup.  This is a comfort food feast and it is filling.  I found the food to be very good and that you might be making several trips to the buffet line for those pierogi.  The Seven Roses experience is a \"trip,\" as we used to say:  the Slavic Village neighborhood, the cheerful proprietress, the buffet items in their warming trays, a disco ball overhead, hearing Polish being spoken, leaving very full, and then being sort of zonked out from it all.  This is something a person can do about once a month because they evidently cook with lots of butter and love.  True to traditional European form, they love to feed you and make sure you're full.  The buffet costs about $13.  I recall that it was cash only.  The good part is that you won't need to eat dinner.  No you won't.  Try Seven Roses and see what you think.  I liked it."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I only got their paczki's on Fat Tuesday.....and they pale in comparison to Kiedrowski's.  They were ok, but the dough was a little tough because I think they were cooked a bit too long.  Fillings were alright, the apricot tasted a bit fake, almost too sweet....let me just say that if you're in the mood for some phenomenal paczki's, skip this place and drive out to Amherst for the best in the region.  However, when I walked in, I was intrigued by the amount of imported goods from Poland and Eastern Europe that covered the shelves....I must return to try some goodies from the homeland!  Their deli also looked like it was filled with some tasty goods.  So, this is just a review in anticipation for my going back and trying more food.  Like the other review mentioned.....CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Best pierogi in town but most bizarre menu and service. Good dill pickel soup.  I have been in here several times and the buffet is always set up with cold food. That's usually your only option. On occasion there is a waitress working but most of the time you walk in to just people eating. Once they announced they were closing only to open up again a few months later. Once, I ordered a 6 dollar pierogi dinner and the waitress told me to go to the buffet and get what I wanted. Then they charged me 14 bucks. Once I ordered Kraut pierogi only to be told to call ahead if you want them. Then they bring you schnitzel and soup and a dessert which, when I asked what it was, the waitress, in a thick accent, replied \"kook-ees.\" I understand that if you go there on a Friday night, that's when you can actually order off the menu and they have everything.  Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Marketers attempt to get your money. They try every which way to convince you that you must have their company's product. At one time they divided consumers into target groups believing at every age our tastes changed. Despite so many young yelpers' comments, marketers discovered age no longer mattered as seniors look and behave more like Cher and less like Barbara Bush. A fairly recent marketing approach is the experience. To attract customers a restaurant must offer more than just a cold beer or a ham sandwich. Restaurants now offer entertainment in what looks like a movie setting. Fake this, fake that.   Seven Roses is a real experience. I think it is unique to our city. Now that some films are being made in Cleveland I expect to see Jennifer Aniston helping herself to sauerkraut at the buffet on the screen of my local Regal Theater.   Seven Roses seems to be totally run by women with only a few speaking English. They sell bakery, deli, home made smoked meats, prepared foods, imported canned goods, and have a buffet. The building is old and the walls are filled with wooden shelves holding jars and cans and adorned with lace. Small wooden tables and chairs are in the back. Old Pope John Paul would have been happy here.   The buffet continues throughout the day with the cook bringing out trays frequently. The dishes change daily and hourly. Small stuffed cabbage is one of the only dishes that is always available. I am not Polish so I do not like every dish nor do I know what many are. That holds true for the bakery and deli as well. The things I have liked keep me coming back.   Last evening I went with two friends. I thought the buffet was not at its best as far as the offerings with too many ground meat dishes. No matter, we all managed to overeat and leave happy. I have learned to go right to the buffet in the back. That way I can pass the bakery and deli stuffed on my way out not wanting to buy everything I see."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic polish lunch buffet. The day we dined there they had stuffed cabbage, smoked and fresh kielbasa, roast chicken, cabbage and noodles, perogies, potato pancakes and whatever else the chef may surprise you with. Make sure to check out the ethnic smoked meats and bakery before you leave."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Polish experiences outside of the home.  I've been dying to find a good Polish restaurant on my \"mid-west\" travels, and I heard Cleveland is known for its Polish community.  So, to the Slavic Village I went.    I was greeted by a lovely lady with a thick Polish accent as soon as I walked in. She took me to the buffet and explained each dish.  My mouth started watering when she showed me the Golumpki (guamke)! This was a traditional dish my Grandma used to make. It was just as delicious as my Grandma's, even though it was of their own creation.   I was going to sit by myself, as I was traveling solo, but just like traditional Polish folks do, they invite you to their table like it's some big feast. I was graciously welcomed by a couple of regular customers and indulged in amazing conversation. The table next to me was full of Polish talk. It reminded me of how we ate during my childhood at Grandma's house.  Later during my meal, I was surprised by the owner? a couple of extra dishes to go along with the buffet. She had given me home-made Italian wedding soup and home-made perogies - oh, wow - the best I've ever had! These \"extra\" surprise dishes change up on an almost every-day basis.  Sometimes they have duck blood soup, borscht, pickle soup, etc.    The front of store has many treats, candies, Polish soup/spice mixes, and other goodies you can take home with you - so be sure to check them out!  The inside and outside of the restaurant were traditionally decorated - even the restaurant sign was in Polish.   This is a more low key restaurant - so, it's not typically too busy or too touristy. It's the real deal. I highly recommend Seven Roses and will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying that I am 100% Polish (in other words: I know my Polish food). I'm going to go ahead and give this deli 5 stars because it is the Polish deli of choice for my family in Cleveland.   I grew up going to the Slavic Village neighborhood every Saturday morning (sometimes Sunday after Polish Mass a few blocks away). Through the years, there were a few Polish delis on Fleet Avenue but now, only this one survives.   If you aren't Polish, let me go ahead and tell you what my favorites are here (I purchase these every single time I'm here):   -croquets (I call these \"Polish eggrolls\"... try the ones with sauerkraut!) -smoked kielbasa (\"Weselna\" is a good kind) -canadian bacon (always really fresh and amazing) -Rasberry (Malinowa) Kiesel (Kiesel is like a warm geletin... such a sweet and tasty treat on a cold day) -Prince Polo (a sweet, chocolatey treat! Basically a very popular candy bar in Poland)   -the freshly baked rolls!! (they are the freshest on Saturday mornings)  A couple of additional side notes about this place: Cash Only! Also, try some of the bulk candy available. When purchasing meats, such as the smoked kielbasa, ask to try a few different varieties before deciding what to purchase-- samples always help!   MMMM... enjoy! As we say in Polish... Smacznego!"}
{"text":"When purchasing food from the deli/store, I advise getting an itemized receipt.  I did not and was shocked by the total."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! We got the lunch buffet which included fresh table served potato pancakes and perogies.  Some of rhe best pancakes I've had. The service was a little off. No one cleared our plates for the buffet or offered drink refills but we will definitely be bavk. The small family owned atmosphere made us feel like we were in another time or place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Polish comfort food for Poles!  Seven Roses is Polish food as it is in Poland.  That is to say, made from scratch, well-composed, and flavorful.  The setup is a bit confusing to the unitiated, but then again, everything in Poland is confusing as hell, too.  :-)  There is a small grocery stocked with Polish imports up front, a deli counter next to the register, and small cafe in the back.  If you want to eat in the cafe, you just have a seat.    White lace curtains don the walls, which are otherwise painted a rose pink color.  There is a pressed tin ceiling.  It's very homey and felt a lot like grandma's house.  The cafe would not be out-of-place in Krakow.    I was greeted promptly by a young woman, who took my beverage order and asked if I would like soup.  She brought me my beverage, a potato pancake, and a cup of barzszcz czerwony (beetroot soup).  The potato pancake was firm, crispy, and fresh, and had been fried in butter.  The soup--which is one of my yardsticks for Polish restaurants--was out-of-this-world.  A bit of cream had been added to give it a nice pink color, and plenty of fresh dill had been added as a flavorful garnish.  There were chunks of shredded beets in the bottom of the cup.  Smaczne!  There is no menu here, so you choose from the small buffet selection, which had eight items during the time of my visit.  There were cabbage and noodles (kluski i kapusta), roasted pork tenderloin, a chicken dish, pierogi ruskie, sauerkraut, stuffed cabbage (go??bki), mashed potatoes and (mysteriously) chili (that I wish had been gulasz instead).    The go??bki were covered in tomato sauce, with fresh dill sprinkled on top.  They were not the most delicious I had ever had (Radio Cafe in Warszawa holds that honor), but were respectable.  The pierogi were made with serem (farmer's cheese) and served boiled--very tasty and traditional.  I enjoyed the roast pork, and the sauerkraut was amazing.    During a second trip to the buffet, there were no pierogi, but one of the servers told me she was about to bring out more, and she did.    If your exposure to Polish food has been limited to prepackaged \"smoked kielbasa\" and frozen pierogi, the food at Seven Roses may not be quite what you expected.  This is the real deal, folks.  All in all, I was very happy with the experience.  My meal, including beverage and tax, ran $10.50.  Bring cash--no credit cards accepted.  You can also order a sandwich from the deli, and both the buffet and deli have \"to-go\" options.    It is important to note, however that Polish is the primary language of this establishment.  It helps if you speak at least a little.  Non-Polish speakers may feel a little lost, although at least one member of the staff (I believe the owner's daughter) speaks good English.    One should also know that, if arriving around 11 or 11:30 AM on a Sunday, this place will be flooded by Poles who just left Mass at St. Stanislaus, so large parties of Polish-speaking folks can be expected.    There is a very popular Polish-American restaurant in town that I find quite tasty, but when I want Polish food that reminds me of the Motherland, I'll be coming to Seven Roses.  Smacznego!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting in Cleveland, and since I'm unfamiliar with the area, I googled \"lunch restaurants\" and Seven Roses caught my eye. I've been a fan of Polish food forever, so I was really excited to try this place & Seven Roses far exceeded my expectations! Everything is made from scratch and DELICIOUS! The atmosphere is very 'old world', but it's still very pleasant and maintained. I opted for the lunch buffet, which offered a respectable range of dishes, all of which were fresh and well attended (nothing was dried out, or greasy). I tried a little bit of everything, and was delighted to find that every dish had a distinct sauce, making for a huge number of possible taste combinations. The chef also brought out a freshly made and PERFECTLY crispy potato pancake, as well as a cup of their daily soup special and a small trio of desserts toward the end. Everything was either readily available, or made quickly, so it was perfect for a quick lunch. They also have a beautiful little grocery, bakery, and deli area. Everything was clean, well lit, and well displayed.  I will definitely be back :) One warning, however: there is extensive construction happening on Fleet Avenue, so be prepared to take a small jog or two around dump trucks or other heavy machinery that blocks the street from time to time. There are many ways around, but I didn't expect that, so heads up!"}
{"text":"Seven Roses is a Polish delight in Broadway that has been left undiscovered by everyone but its neighborhood locals.  It's got the touches of a market, deli, bakery, and restaurant all rolled into one.  A group of us stopped by the restaurant while checking out the Broadway area and found ourselves stuffed.  They don't have the typical amount of food expected at a buffet -- but what they have is good.  Upon seating, we were promptly served crispy and thicker-than-usual potato pancakes and plump pierogis.  Their pierogis were delicious and had a great flavor and consistency to them.  As for buffet foods, group favorites were the grilled pork, kielbasa/sauerkraut, mini-meatloafs, and potatoes.  The location is pretty inconvenient for those in the main Cleveland area, but worth a try during a slow day.  If I ever plan on returning to the Broadway area, I would definitely make a stop at Seven Roses to dine in and then do some shopping."}
{"text":"Every year we wait in line at Oktoberfest for the sampler plate and it s worth that wait even when all the other booths have shorter lines."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Seven Roses a few weeks ago... on accident. I know, I know... how does that happen? We were going to another restaurant close by, the GPS glitched, we stopped here instead... long story short, I'm so glad we went to the wrong place!   Lunch is a buffet, but so much more... after we got a plate of food from the buffet, the staff kept bringing more courses! Homemade Amish chicken noodle soup, fresh potato pancakes, fresh sauteed pierogies, desserts... There was so much food for only $10! And the staff was super friendly. I felt like family there!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, some friends and I went to Seven Roses three times last week.  Each time we went we had a different and unique experience.  The way the place works is you sit down wherever you like and begin with the buffet.  Each time we went, the staples were cabbage rolls, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, meatballs, and pork.  They mixed in BBQ ribs on the second day and some amazing schnitzel the third.  But that is just the buffet.  Throughout the meal, you will be presented with soup, potato pancakes, perogies and desert, all freshly made in the kitchen.  The total cost of the meal is $12 with soda and is well worth the price.  I must warn, that after the buffet, you will be exhausted and probably need a nap, but that is all part of the fun.    Seven Roses also has a take out and deli featuring a number of Polish staples."}
{"text":"I found out about this place because I went to Saint Monica's carnival and they had a stand there.  The food (I tried the potato pancakes and  pierogies) at the carnival was amazing so I assumed that the actual restaurant would be terrific.  Boy was I wrong.    First thing you should know is that they only accept cash or check.  Okay, no problem since this is a family owned company.   My fiance and I arrived there around 4, 430ish.  We get there and the lady says to choose any table.  We go and sit down and I tell my fiance that I guess we should go and get our plates made.  He says that we should wait because maybe they had menu's instead of just a buffet.  This was not the case.  The lady comes over and says that all they have is iced tea in the cooler or water.  We chose water.  She said to go help ourselves.    We get up to the buffet line (which really isn't a buffet, it's just 5 metal servers over some bunson burners - looks like they bought them at Sams Club) to get our food.  There is none!  Ok, I take that back...out of the 5 metal servers, one had a good amount of stuffed cabbage in it, and the rest had crusted over resemblances of bits of food.  I am serious, there was nothing in the rest of them!  So I get my cabbage and sit down to eat.  A lady comes back and says she can bring us some vegetable soup.  I graciously accept the offering since I am stuck eating only a little bit of sub-par stuffed cabbage that tastes kind of like Stouffers if you ask me.  The soup was pretty bad.  It tasted only of dill, and if you have tasted dill you know how overpowering this is.    The lady then said that  she is making potato pancakes and that some new stuff is being brought to the buffet line.  She didn't lie, someone did bring out some type of sausage that was stuffed with a whole pickle and topped with a brown gravy (disgusting and dry by the way)  but that is all they brought out (we were up to two dishes to choose from).  When the one potato pancake came out it was entirely blackish brown.  Yes, they burned the one thing that every Polish restaurant should know how to make perfectly.  I have NEVER had a bad potato pancake, and this place managed to make the worst one I have ever tasted.  We hurriedly ate the potato pancake and ran to pay the $16.00 for the two pieces of stuffed cabbage,  soup, and a burnt potato pancake per person.  While paying, the lady told us that we should have come earlier, around 2-3p.m. when everything is fresh and while they still have everything.  Oh, ok, so now I understand.  You charge people the same price at 4-430pm when everything is eaten and crusty as you do when you first open up the buffet?  And to top it off you never replenish that buffet?  I am so sorry, but to me that is just highway robbery.   The food was horrible, the price was horrible, and to be totally honest, I feel like I totally just threw away my money.  I understand that other reviewers had better results, and maybe this is true for during the week.  But believe me, you do not want to go to their \"Saturday\" buffet of hell."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming here because of the overall great reviews and wonderful pictures. Got the buffet for two, there was cabbage rolls, kraut, kielbasa , mashed potatoes, mixed veggies, roast beef, and they brought out two potato pancakes, two small pierogi for each of us, and lastly a piece of cake for each of us, but no soup was offered like other reviewers mentioned / received. I was ok with that, as there was already a lot of food. Food was pretty tasty, especially the cabbage rolls and mashed potatoes, though I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to Eastern European  comfort food. The check out is where it turned sour. I approached the counter with three $10's in my hand, figuring it was going to be around $25 with tax, based on the other Yelp reviews I read. The woman at counter punches in $15 twice and takes the whole $30 from me! I asked her \"How much was it per meal?\" and she replies \"$15.00\", even though there's a stack of menus by the register that list the price as $8.99. I point to that and she says \"prices have gone up, that paper is old\" and \"we are going to be getting rid of the buffet soon, I don't like it.\" So many \"wtf's?\" were swirling around my head at that moment. I didn't want to cause any problems with this lady, there's already a slight language barrier , she's kinda gruff, and I did enjoy the food, so I quietly left, but did take a copy of their pricing sheet. I'd be interested to know what people are charged who dine there after me though, please post!"}
{"text":"My mother was from the former Yugoslavia and my Grandmother was from Germany. I grew up eating food just like this. It was like being back at my grandmother's house. There weren't very many people here when we arrived, which was surprising since Solkolowsi's is always so busy and this place is just as good. I suppose it's just not very well known, which is good for me. I didn't have to wait in line. Everyone in here was speaking Polish, I think, and everyone seemed to know each other.   I'll start by saying it's a lunch buffet and I ate 4 plates. There was stuffed cabbage rolls, pork schnitzel, sweet peppers and chicken, kielbasa, sour kraut, potato pancakes and pierogi. They also had some rigatoni but that's not what I came for. I also took some delicious apple cake home. I was so stuffed I couldn't do anything else that day. You should go here but not all of you. I don't want this place getting so busy that I have a hard time getting a table."}
