{"text":"Best. Crispy. Chilli. Paneer. Ever.

That's the dish that makes going to this restaurant completely worth it. I have sushi-style cravings for the hot, spicy crispy paneer with some steamed rice or fried rice Yumm!!. The chicken corn soup is really good too. The chilli chicken, and Manchurian beef are decent as well, standard Mississauga-level-of-good Hakka Chinese, nothing too exceptional.

The service is slow and not the greatest, be very clear with your order(I'm taking a star off for this). The food does come out of the kitchen piping hot however. The place can get pretty busy with large families on weekends, but I've never had to wait for a table.

Prices are around $11 for a family style serving. Oh and it is Halal for anyone looking out for that :)"}
{"text":"Food here is decent though over-priced for the portion size.  Not a bad choice if you are local but I wouldn't drive out of the way for it.  The service is not stellar but the kid working there is polite and tries hard so that alone got this place an extra star. 

What I did find bothersome and worth mentioning is that on 2 occasions I was asked by 2 different servers to pay tip in cash because if I add it to the cheque, the owner keeps it for himself to off-set the charges of accepting credit cards.  That is simply dishonest and exploitive.  I don't pay an extra 15-20% for good service so the owner can pocket it.  If tips are to be paid in cash then that should be mentioned on the cheque and the \"tip\" section on the cheque should be eliminated to prevent any confusion."}
{"text":"I always have a little trepidation when attempting to have chinese indian fusion or any type of fusion for that matter. Its a real challenge to make two cuisines mesh, but these guys pulled it off. I had the chilli paneer which was off the hook. I would go for that if you can and stay away from the chicken. Not that the chicken is bad but it might not work with some weird fusion style sauce."}
{"text":"great local place. although we've got a lot of Hakka options in the area we keep coming back here. crispy chili veggie, any paneer dish and Hakka noodles are awesome. reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is an Indian - Chinese fusion restaurant (Hakka). The food is average for a hakka retaurant. But the crispy chilli paneer is to die for! My friends who are big meatatarians order chiken dish and keep eyeing my dish. They are quite happy just eating that with some Manchurian fried rice. The quantities are quite big and worthy of sharing. As for service let's just say it has come a long way.This is hard to rate as I would give crispy chilli paneer 6 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Das \"Hot & Sour\" ist ein ganz nett gestaltetes, chinesisches Restaurant, nicht weit vom \"Kingsbridge Common\",oder dem \"Heritage Hills Park\" an der recht bekannten Hauptstrasse \"Terry Fox Way\"!
Aussergewoehnlich freundliches, aufmerksames Personal und gute Speisen/ Getraenke. Die Preise sind normal fuer Canadische Verhaeltnisse ( zwischen $ 6.99 und $ 18.99 ). Ich hatte - vegetable spring rolls
 - chili shrimp mit fried rice 
 - lychee icecream
 - soft drinks & ein green tea pot,
alles sehr lecker! :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing crispy chilli paneer, you gotta have it!  Szechuan rice was delicious and really good dry chicken chilli.  No problems with service, very nice young waiter who made sure we didn't need anything else.  They leave a pitcher of water (I guess for those who can't take the spice).  Don't worry about the level of spicyness, it is not overload.  Very nice simple restaurant overall.  Large portions and good prices!  Only went there for dinner so no comments can be made about lunch."}

{"text":"From the moment I stepped foot in this place I knew it was a mistake, but since I am generally a very patient and forgiving person I really wanted to give Hot & Sour a chance. Next time I will follow my instincts and run!

As I was parking the car I couldn't help but notice two couples enter the restaurant, one right after another, and I thought this might be a good sign of a popular place. However I was quickly smacked in the face by reality.

Upon entering I was shocked to see that every single empty table had not been cleaned! Considering this small restaurant only had twelve tables max, and three were taken, this was completely inexcusable. A young man quickly came forward and cleaned a table for us and went to the back, leaving the rest of the tables filthy. As we sat for close to five minutes without menus, my date and I seriously debated leaving, yet I thought we should give them a chance.. and I was very hungry! Unfortunately things continued to go downhill from here.

We ordered drinks and food from the young man, and he returned some time later with cutlery and plates that were.. you guessed it, dirty. At least he realized it as he was putting one of the plates down and quickly came back with a clean one. 

After a reasonable time our first order of food was brought to our table, but no drinks. We asked for our drinks and some water, yet received only the water and one drink!

Thinking he would come back with it,  our other dishes arrived but with the wrong kind of rice! After another inquiry the final drink arrived, and at this point I didn't bother asking for the correct rice. I really just wanted to eat and leave as soon as possible and get out of there.

The food was good, but the portions were smaller compared to similar restaurants in Mississauga like Eddies Wok n Roll, and Salt and Pepper. If you truly feel like taking a chance on the food, order take-out and eat at home.

A note on the rating. I give it barely 3 stars for the food, the restaurant and service 1 star, for an overall rating of 2 stars. And I consider this to be a very generous rating!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this Is the best restaurant in this neighbourhood. I live very close to this place so I usually walk and get takeout. I have never sat down an been served by a person so I might give a lower rating once I go inside. Food: the food is soooooo good. My favourite is the noodles and Manchurian beef, it is so tasty and delicious. I love this place"}
{"text":"This place all what a strip mall restaurant should not be. High price, unclean place, lack of courtesy in staff, and mediocre tasting food,"}
{"text":"This place was really good and I'm surprised most of the reviews here are giving it a bad score. It must have improved a lot over the months because it's way better than what many of these reviews are saying.

The staff were friendly and the food was top notch. Hot and Sour soup, fish pakora, chili chicken, and the paneer/fish gravies were all marvelous and full of rich tasting flavour. I would definitely come back. Very nice."}
{"text":"Yummy! We ordered three dishes tonight and all three were very good.  

The Hot and Sour soup had just the right amount of tang and spicy heat and was full of veggies, fresh coriander and green onions. It was delicious and the medium portion was huge for two people. 

The spring rolls were homemade and were nicely seasoned and crispy. 

The dry Manchurian Pakoras were amazing  Crispy fried balls of battered chopped veggies coated with a lovely spice mixture and topped with chopped onions and coriander. They were crunchy, tangy, delicious and addictive!

This place was a surprise find in a strip mall in Mississauga and it is definitely worth trying. While I usually only give feedback about the food, the service was outstanding that it deserved a mention. 

We will be back!

{"text":"Ok folks, as soon as you look at the name you know it would be a fusion between Chinese, Pakistani and Indian food. So I had to check it out!

My first observation was no parking problem as they are in a plaza. As I walked the the restaurant was quite clean and decent size. The service was a little slow in the start as its a mom/pop shop there is like few waiter walking around, but not unbearable. I like mom/pop shops as they bring their own flavor to the food.

The menu seems slightly higher then a low end hakkah place but not too expensive. Most of their dishes were within $10 to $12 range, only the appetizers seemed quite high and your better off buying the meal. 

I saw a lunch sign and they have some specials around lunch time.

We ordered their medium Vegetable hot and sour soup and Chicken fingers with fries from their appetizer menu. Wow They portions were huge the appetizer was like a meal! 

The soup was made fresh lots of vegetables and taste great! we truly enjoyed the soup and couldn't finish it. We also took some home.

I really enjoyed their fries as they were crispy and rightly salty but the chicken fingers were a downer as they looked to be from a packet and just fried.

Over all they food came out quick, we enjoyed the fusion and they server was great and friendly.

Ohhh! and for my fellow Muslim Bros & Sis - Its a Halal restaurant and They have serve halal meat!"}
{"text":"Don't waste ur time very rude guy can't even give chilly for 50 dollars of take out food !!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.
Service was horrible.
Ordered from uber eats, they didn't bring the cutlery, i called and ask if they can bring it, they told me I should have requested it in uber eats.
Isn't providing cutlery a basic requirement? I'm not asking for more or for more napkins.
Just basic cutlery, 1 pair of chopsticks, 2 pieces of wood ain't too much To ask.

Long story short, I called the restaurant how can I eat? the guy said either I pay for the uber to bring me chopsticks or 'tough'.

That's when I got pissed off and wrote this.
RIP this restaurant"}
{"text":"Bad customer service not good food quality if u want to waste money and time they its the place 
When I made the complaint about my over all experience the owner did not bother to clarify on top says it can happen some time as they are also humans
My advice plz don't visit"}
{"text":"Here on a visit from the US on the weekend and found this place. It's got one of the best, if not The Best, hot and sour soups in US and Canada. Food overall was just amazing. Makes me wanna drive back again just for this."}
{"text":"Horrible.  I called to asked if they delivered he said no and as I said okay and started ordering he hung up!!!!!! When I called back,  he said you asked if we delivered,  we are hot and sour soup restaurant,  I told him I was going to order with him but since that's the service I got I won't be ordering with them.  EVER."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place very often when I was in High School due to its proximity to both my home and school. During lunch hours they can be packed with take-out orders so even tough they aren't busy with dine-in, your food may take awhile to come out. The food has slowly taken a turn of unfortunate events, it seems as the years progressed the food has consistently gone downhill which is very unfortunate as this place used to be very good. The fried rice, chilli chicken and other offerings aren't very good, both dishes has a strange aftertaste and smell; I wasn't the only person who noticed this. 

I did bring it up to the manager at one point, it was at this point he told me I'm not aware of what Hakka food should be."}
{"text":"Pathetic , always smelling like oil paint , it was lunch time but it was completely empty ordered rhe hot n sour soup it was so sour coudn't finish it the waiter said let me replace it after 10 minutes it was the same taste.
Not going to this place at all very expensive as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the manchurian noodles and the delhi style dry chili chicken. Both were delicious. Huge take-out portions, they were not stingy with adding veggies to both dishes (some places just give you a pile of noodles), and the dishes were spicy and super flavourful. would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I dined in at this restaurant after approximately 5 years. I wasn't impressed then and sadly my experience was the same now. The ambience and décor is beautiful, but the food served is mediocre at best. You ask the customer at the time of payment how the food was, would you like a customer to be honest in front of everyone. No, most people just don't come back; if the owners are reading this, I urge you to bring more passion & flavour in your dishes. Come out from the cash register area & speak to your patrons. 

Serving a menu with Halal meat is not enough anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats, took almost an hour for them to prepare food. Food was horrible. Manchurian chicken was basically bland boiled chicken with nasty sour sauce and chunky batter everywhere. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place used to be be extremely good. But the last two years it has gone down in quality and quantity. 

Today I ordered soup and chicken drumsticks. They were charred and the soup had enough salt to give a family of 4 a heart attack. Never going back again. Please avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Went there again to see how it would have been just an odd day last time 

It was pretty busy. The owner (bearded guy) was very polite and accommodated us well
Once the server came (girl in a yellow jacket, wearing a name \"rehana), didn't even know the menu well. 
When I placed the order, she said we should order rice, So we ordered steamed rice. And she said \"order enough rice now coz if you run out of it, it is too busy at this time to get you more quickly\". I would have assumed that the quickest thing to get would be a bowl of already cooked rice.
And believe me, at one point, she rolled her eyes towards us. Talk about service .

Anyway, this place is very stingy about giving out napkins. My advice- take your own with you. I had to ask three times to give us napkins. Each time the server got a few thin; low quality napkins. It seems like napkins are expensive these days.

The corn soup wasn't bad. 
The best item in the menu was Dragon chicken. That is probably the best item on the menu 
The schezuan fish was terrible. Heavily breaded fish (hardly a small piece of fish). The sauce was no where close to the schezuan sauce 
The shrimp in garlic was also just blehhhh

It seems like the most common ingredient in their cooking is ketchup
You can taste it in everything , from soups from entrees

Anyway, go there as the last option
Not the best place to be at 
Also, I find it ridiculous that at a \"so-called\" Chinese restaurant, has entrees that don't come with rice.
The steamed rice have to be ordered separately.
And they are very poor quality rice. You will see it to believe it 

Again: if you are out of options, go there. Otherwise try a different place"}
