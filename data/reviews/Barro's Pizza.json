{"text":"It was great! Great customer service! I definitely recommend anyone looking for good pizza & wings, to stop by Barro's! We were greeted immediately once arriving, & were asked to have our order takin. She even gave us an extra cup! Our food was served promptly and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I think the pizza is below average, but my husband thinks it's \"ok.\" The cheese is rubbery and the pepperoni is way too salty. The service was awful the last time we ordered so we'll be looking for a new pizza place."}
{"text":"I am completely dissatisfied with with this location .. we order a pizza at least 5 times a week always the same ... until 1 came that was absolutely gross and non edible when we called we were told that there was nothing they could do or would do to make it right.... therfore we will not order from them or barros ever again"}
{"text":"So this place reminds me of this lil mom and pop place I used to go to. There wings are amazing but there pizza is ok.. now this place has the same mom and pop feel and taste but better. I love how there ranch is made not bought. So freash. I don't really like pizza but man there pizza is SOOOOO good."}
{"text":"I love barros. I am probably their best customer. I am there at least 3 times a week either getting a well priced beer or having my favorite pizza. I love that they actually know me when I come in. Great place and great food."}
{"text":"We were just traveling through town for the night and Yelped pizza reviews... And picked Barros.  We ordered delivery to our hotel and they arrived very quickly and our Meaty pizza was great. My only suggestion is order small. Our pizza was very doughy and filling-we couldn't finish it all!"}
{"text":"This a great place!  The wings and pizza are really good and at a fair price.  It's great for the family and it's close to home and they do a lot of fund raising  for the school."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza(Italian sausage and pepperoni) and great service. Highly recommend! Eating here for years never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza an even better wings!! The delivery was fast, food was hot and the guy was very nice."}
{"text":"I have been a Barros customer for 15 plus years. We order at least once every two weeks. Our neighborhood location (Alma school) closed and so we have been going to the location in Tempe on baseline. We normally pickup the order, but this time we wanted it delivered and the closest location was this one. We ordered our normal 2 large pizzas and a total of 24 wings. The pizza was not as good a the old location or the Tempe store. The cheese was minimal and it was not spread around the pie very well. The wings were not good as they were under cooked and didn't have the normal amount of sauce. We only received 1 side of celery (should have been 2) and even though we ordered and were charged, we only received one serving of ranch, when it should have been three. When we found a broken piece of white plastic in the wings, we pitched all the wings in the trash, along with the pizza. We called the store and got no customer service. We re-ordered from the Tempe store and enjoyed our pizza and wings with no problems. We will not be back this location."}
{"text":"We love Barro's. We have tried just about all of the pizzas, wings and sandwiches.  It was all GREAT!!  No complaints. And, really nice people there."}
{"text":"Barros actually has some of my favorite pizza but I won't order from this location again.  My husband and I ordered a pizza and some wings on Sunday and were quoted 45 minutes to an hour for delivery.  The girl on the phone corrected herself right before we hung up and said \"it may be a little over an hour, we are really busy\"- I said no problem.  An hour and a half later I called to check the status of our order and was told that it hadn't even been made yet.  The manager asked if I was quoted 2 hours to which I answered no and told her we were quoted \"a little over an hour\".  She proceeded to apologize and tell me that our delivery would likely be another 45 minutes before arrival! That's 2 hours and 15 minutes for a pizza and wings...no thank you! We cancelled our order.  Now a few days later the charges are still on my account.  I'm annoyed with the whole thing probably more so because I'm 7 months pregnant and my patience is low.  I was very surprised that we weren't even offered as much as a coupon for our next visit.  Just poor customer service all around...we will find a new \"go to\" pizza place."}
{"text":"Poorly managed take your business elsewhere.  Last time we ordered they forgot our wings. I called and they said they would be on there way it took another hour for them to show up. When I called the manager they said next time we ordered they would take 50% off our order. Called tonight and of course that was socumneted in the system so that manager wouldn't honor it. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent pizza.  We get the lunch special, and sometimes the cheese is a little glossy and they have a tendency to stack the slices one on top of the other.  The slices are huge!"}
{"text":"Well my beloved Barros.. When the pizza is right it is amazing. When the dough is not right it is a grease pit. I wish there were more coupons also. I used to eat here at least once a week but I find more and more it is disappointing and over priced. I gave 4 stars because I grew up in AZ and Barros was always my first choice. I used to even eat it for lunch in high school. It just rarely seems the same the past 2 years."}
{"text":"The floor was dirty, the windowsills were dirty with many dead flies. We fought off flies the entire time we were trying to eat. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Barro's experience I've ever had today in 35 years I've been a loyal follower Barro's for a long time and today I think I just change my mind the garlic bread wasn't posted and barely had cheese on it all the soda was flat Pizza Hut so much sauce on it you can bring it out like a sponge"}
{"text":"Normally go to Barros at 83rd Cactus - Awesome place.   I can't even call this a Barros in comparison. In at 1pm for lunch, 20 mins in line with only 2 in front of us.  Slices out, everything 20 min wait.  Horrible service, lukewarm pizza, premade sad salad.  So glad we live Westside."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Barro's, but my first at this location. This staff was helpful and friendly. I tried the thin crust pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage. The sausage seemed to be the fresh variety and had a nice, slightly spicy flavor. I enjoyed all the toppings and would definitely return to get a thin crust pizza. I tried the hand tossed pizza on my initial visit and would definitely recommend the thin. It's the same dough, but the thin doesn't overwhelm the flavor profile like the thicker hand tossed does."}
{"text":"Solid Pizza place for the family.    Very consistent.  Good quality.   Like the thicker crust they serve."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza crispy and not too greasy. It's pizza done right. Friendly staff and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"if you love thick crust pizza, this one's a keeper.  it's a hearty pizza, buffalo wings are good too.  often order the pepperoni and it's consistently delicious.  slices are large.  a casual dining experience for family and/or friends.  this is another bucket list item.  top3 reasons why... 1- delicious menu items 2- good value 3- atmosphere (casual dining, location, cheerful service)"}
{"text":"Pasta looked like it had a bit too much cheese. Pizza was okay. Even the service wasn't good.  Pineapple pizza didn't have pineapples in the first place. They had to top it & bake again."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious and its always a great experience. I would recommend this Barro's to everyone I know!!"}
{"text":"I decided to order from here on Monday night do to the fact they deliver and Rays doesn't. Well what waste of money! Pizza was bad and wings are not much better. I used to order from here weekly until we found Rays and I don't remember it being so gross. I have learned my lesson and will not make that mistake again!!"}
{"text":"Really... 2 thin slices of roast beef on a sandwich. I would be embarrassed to serve such a lame sandwich"}
{"text":"Dine-in or take-out, this place is great. Fresh delicious pizza at a reasonable price and great customer service! This is the ONLY spot we go for pizza. Their wings are good too!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. It never lets me down. The food is always fresh and piping hot, the  wings are the best and they're big!  I always come here with friends and family and I suggest other people should come to try it out. The beer is the coldest in town!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always hot and fresh! The best pizza I've had in az so far. The wings are good, only one time they where gross but hasn't happened again."}
{"text":"Best pizza for the value, hands down! Nice clean atmosphere and great bar menu. Staff is always courteous. Just a nice place to go for a night out with the family or friends"}
{"text":"Best lunch value around at $4.32 for two slices and a drink, except for Costco.  Staff is always friendly.  Stop by on Thursday for the meat trio which is delicious."}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed with this restaurant.  I ordered from here couple nights ago and had a really great experience. The pizza was really delicious and for a GREAT price!!!! The slices were large, and the food arrived HOT and on time. I have zero complaints about my experience, I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious! (See pics) We're from out of town & found this place through Yelp, of course. It was as good as everybody said. I'm glad we stopped here. We'll probably stop here again when we're in town."}
{"text":"Barrow's is going downhill. For years it was our go to place for pizza, wings (salad, pasta, sandwiches, etc). But lately pizza has been really greasy and flavorless and wings fatty. We ordered tonight (hoping last couple of times were off nights, new cooks...) but nope.  Barrows will now be crossed off as place to go."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Barro's Pizza!  Great pizza!  Great service!  Great all together at this location!  They even deliver very fast!  The crust is awesome!  Cheese is awesome!  I enjoy going there as well!  Get my favorite booth and watch the game!  Why wouldn't you like this place?"}
{"text":"The blonde young lady that works lunch hours was extremely rude.  I order two slices of pizza then a new fresh pizza came out.  I hadn't even walked away from the counter with my pizza when i asked if i could switch it out.  She gave me major attitude so I said never mind. Great pizza, bad service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get pizza! Wings aren't that great though. Nice staff overall."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Omg why is Barro's so f'ing good?!!???  So fattening but i love it! My one cheat day a week, Barro's is the place for me. I've never had anything i didn't like. And the customer service is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Lunch special is awesome. The BBQ Chicken Pizza is the bomb.  Gina and Bruce, you need to get on Veebow. That's Valarie Bertinelli's company."}
{"text":"I've always preferred a thick Chicago-style pizza to a thin New York-style any day. With the lunch special that they have even on the weekends, it makes me want to hit up Barro's everyday. San Tan brew on tap and I'm set for lunch."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good service.  Very reasonably priced. Went back twice while vacationing. Wish I had a Barro's where I live."}
{"text":"Good food and pleasant staff. First time visiting and certainly not the last.  Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Try the Pineapple and Bacon (not Canadian) combo on original crust. It's AMAAAAZING."}
{"text":"Usually love this place, and I understand a pizza business is busy on a Friday night.   The problem is when you call and order and they tell you \"25 minutes\" then you've been standing around waiting for over an hour.  I'm not much of a complainer but did watch a lady in front of me blow up!     The manager didn't seem to want to fix anybody's problem. Just told everybody that was a big order in front of everyone else. That's fine but don't tell people that their orders will be ready in 25 minutes. Then you end up standing in a restaurant for 40 minutes.  Just tell your customers when they order that it's going to take an hour for their pizza to be ready. I think most reasonable people understand that on a Friday night a lot of people order pizza and you may have to wait a little bit. There were a lot of very pissed off people in the front of that restaurant and the manager did not seem to know how to handle them. I would guess this place lost some customers tonight"}
{"text":"I'm super picky about pizza there's was delicious I was very impressed. Super cheesy makes me happy. We got boneless wings they were excellent as well honey barbecue and medium we got Ranch to go with their wings and pizza the girls they're working or very friendly and smiling. There also was a little area for kids to play which is awesome my niece had a great time. I live in phoenix, I'll have to check if there is a location on the east side."}
{"text":"Great place for Watching a game. Play area for little kids!  Awesome  Great food, beer and wine!! TVs everywhere and the staff doesn't bug You to get you more food or drinks:)"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love their gluten free pizza. They just have one size (small) about $12. BBQ wings are very good (and big). Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Tastes GOOD!  I'm from out of town (New York) and was introduced to this place as one of the best local pizzeria chains in the Phoenix area. Given the raving reviews I've heard from acquaintances who derive ecstasy from dining here after a series of late night debaucheries and inebriation, I decided to give this place a shot for a late night dinner!  I ordered the Hot Wing Pizza and was surprised at how flavorful and balanced it was. I initially pictured an overly greasy, too soft or too hard dough with sporadically dumped seasoning, watery but overwhelmingly salted tomato paste, and rubbery cheese - much of what you would expect at Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Instead, Barro's Hot Wing Pizza packed that powerful punch that one expects from hot  sauce - piquant and weltering yet smooth - but is not overwhelming. It had a good balance of buffalo sauce, cheese, and chicken that did not override one particular taste. The pizza is served fresh from the oven and remains piping hot for the first few minutes, so you can experience that mozzarella and cheddar melting in your mouth. Likewise, the tomato sauce was savory on the palette but wasn't overly salty. The original crust was decent at best, but at least it's not oozing in butter (still a bit greasy though). If Barro's tastes this great while I'm sober, I can't wait to have some while I'm drunk.  For my New York friends, it's not Lucali's, Roberta's, or Paulie Gee's, but it's delicious for what it is. It's definitely above Domino's and Pizza Hut (which I can only eat when I'm feeling disheveled or super drunk). I also walked 30 minutes in 110 degree weather for lunch to get a slice of pepperoni pizza from Barro's, so it's worth it for anyone - whether you're a local or a visitor looking for a quick good-tasting pizza."}
{"text":"There's a flavor in their crust that I really love, it might be basil, but I'm not sure.  This is a great place for Mom's to come in the afternoon with their kids, they've got an area for playing (approx for ages 3 and under) while the Mom's can sit and chat.  The pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"They're sweet red chili wings are delicious, I'd recommend going there for wings , they're way better than the oven made ones you get at other places ."}
{"text":"Pizza is good for the price, but don't have it delivered. They were 45 minutes late delivering the pizza and they don't have the best customer service."}
{"text":"Went here to check it out since my coworker was singing Barro's praises. Welp, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. The crust (the most important part of a pizza) is weird and kinda spongy, but otherwise comparable to any other run-of-the-mill pizza joint.   I got the Kona, which is some kind of play on a Hawaiian pizza except it has chicken instead of ham and some kind of sweet teriyaki glaze instead of red sauce. Not very good, and if I had it to do again I'd just get a traditional pizza. Still, don't think it's really worth it without a coupon or something.  The staff was nice and the atmosphere if you're dining in (I didn't) seems above average for this type of place."}
{"text":"All the girls on the staff look pissed off and unapproachable. Doesn't make sense, you are being paid to do your job so maybe put a smile on your face. Also a tip when coming out of the swinging door with a HOT PIZZA, maybe say \"coming out\" so you stop running into people"}
{"text":"Today I found out the are charging 50¢ more a slice for meat trio.  I doubt I will be coming here on Thursdays any more."}
{"text":"Very bad experience when calling to order two pizzas. Website advertising pricing on pizzas is not the same as when called. Spoke to supervisor and she wasn't very helpful, claimed that prices changed as of the first of the year and weren't the same as their website. To me this is false advertising, won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"We usually like Barros so I took my family over a couple of weeks ago for an evening meal.  My daughter is sensitive to gluten, so we ordered a gluten free pizza, regular pizza and wings.  Their regular pizza was good as always.  The gluten-free however, came out with the crust burned.  I tasted the edge of it and it tasted as burned as it looked.  I took it back and was told that's just the way it is with gluten-free.  Since I ordered meat on the pizza, they had to make sure it was cooked so the crust gets burned.  That's it - no offer to make it better, just go ahead and eat it.  So I wasn't happy about that, but to make matters a little more annoying, I could hear the teenage server talking to someone in the back (the cook I'm guessing) and making some smart-alec remark about my complaint. That's cool I guess, but FYI - it's a pretty small store and I can hear you out by the cash register Einstein.  The wings were OK, but very wet.  Oh, and they don't have any wet-wipes, so you just have to go through about 20 disintegrating napkins while eating your wet wings.  So, 4 stars overall for the pizza, minus 2 stars for the crappy service and smart-alec high school servers.  I'll just stick to Sardellas, who apparently have already taken the class on how to make gluten-free pizza."}
{"text":"Delicous. Love the lunch specials. Delivery takes a little while but picking up or eating in isn't to long of a wait. Service is good. My main thing is their lunch specials. Cheap and quick"}
{"text":"I went to barros at 10:45 last night. They close at \"11:00 p.m.\" they wouldn't serve me anything! Not a pizza, not a breasstick, or a pepperoni from the salad bar."}
{"text":"Not great, but very good pizza. Most importantly they are consistent. Their crust is never soggy or sloppy. They are generous with toppings. They cook them until the cheese us lightly browned. They are orders of magnitude better than Dominos or Pizza Hut. It is the only pizza I order now.  It takes about an hour for delivery, I assume that is because they actually cook it. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is slow. Each time I've been to Barro's Pizza they've taken over an hour to get the order out to the table. The food is good so I don't mind going back for slow service."}
{"text":"Great pizza but was told 30 minutes and it was an hour.   Service expectation was flat."}
{"text":"This is not a review on the food, their pepperoni pizza has always been one of my favorites. However, this location quoted me 20 minutes for pizza pickup and despite the place being dead, 50 minutes later I was still waiting for my pizza. The girl up front told me \"just a little longer\" ... which turned into an additional 15 minutes, I mean come on!  They gave me a free ranch for my inconvenience.."}
{"text":"My family loves this place but honestly it's one of the worst run businesses I deal with.  Not sure who owns/manages this place but if you are reading this, get in there and take a close look at what's happening. We get pizza here a couple times a month and there is something wrong 80% of the time.  I stopped having them deliver and just pick up because I got tired of waiting an hour plus for an incorrect order. If we order 4 extra ranch, then make sure it's included.  If you run out of a basic ingredient than your failing.  If your gps doesn't work then find a desk job.  It's just not this hard."}
{"text":"Gotta say, great pizza!   And when the wife and 9 year old boy are happy, that's the fifth star!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious !! Cheese sticks were amazing and the wings were bomb   the place is nice and casual not a restaurant feeling more like a fast food feeling but over all I loved it and the staff was friendly and polite"}
{"text":"I love this Barros. The girls here are always so friendly and accommodating. They do their jobs with a smile on their face and I experience great customer service here every time I come. Thank you"}
{"text":"Wow. We were all excited a barros opened close to our house.  Were we ever disappointed. We ordered a thin crust pizza that took like 30 minutes, and it came out uncooked and greasy.  When we politely complained and asked if they could cook it more, the 18something manager on duty came back to our table and actually argued with us. To the point of being a real bitch. We told her to forget it, didn't eat the liquid dough pizza, and left.  We had 8 in our party, and we all vowed we would never ever step foot in a barros again.  And let everyone know about our experience. That manager probably does more damage in a week than can be imagined. Hope the owner figures it out before this place is the empty shell it was on power rd.   We'll stick with blue32."}
{"text":"OK, my review is not about the pizza, but about the horrible customer service attitude of the manager Steve. My wife ordered a cheese pizza with EXTRA cheese on November 11. I told her I would pick it up on my way home from work. I had no idea what she ordered as it didn't matter. I picked it up and brought it home, had 2 pieces and then my wife says \"this is not what I ordered\". It had ham on it. So she called the store and ended up talking to manager Steve. Wow, no customer service skills at all. He then insinuated that's what we ordered and was actually arguing the point with my wife. He said if we came back he would make another.....NO, you made the mistake so you deliver it. Listen Steve, it is just a pizza so get us the right one and don't argue. Oh, the one they brought.......NO extra cheese like we ordered, and they actually wanted the wrong one back which we gladly gave them."}
{"text":"This was the first pizza place I tried when I moved here and by far I think it has the best pizza. The wings are good and the delivery is fast and with a smile. The staff has always be fair and kind even when they are busy. I love this place."}
{"text":"Always fresh, they are great at delivering in a timely manner and the food is always hot. The wings are crispy with just enough sauce, we've tried all the flavors and each are unique. The pizzas awesome, I recommend light sauce because they still give you plenty. These guys are my go to indulgence and never let us down!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad at a great price. Whether dining in or delivery, the food is always good and on time. We love it here!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Salad bad, such as it is, is poor. Call ahead if you reserved tables for a party. We reserved several but they allowed others to take them, even though we were on time. Luckily for them Anthem doesn't have much competition."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere.  They have a back room that I like to use/reserve for team meetings.  Everyone likes it.  Cheap salad bar with a lot of yummy or healthy options.  Lunch specials are delish and inexpensive.  No one complains when we go there.  Staff is always knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Barro's Is My Favorite !!! This location is hit or miss but they hit more than they miss.."}
{"text":"I really love thus pizza best of all! The meat lovers is my favorite for a regular day. When we are in the mood for some spicy... The southwestern chicken pizza is insane good! The boneless chicken wings are awesome. Me being very picky with chicken I think these are hands down better than buffalo wild wings for sure. If your in the mood for pizza thus is the place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and reasonably priced.  Medium Pizza for $11 and they are not chintzi with the toppings.   I called in my order and it was ready on time.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I love Barros and they have GF crust too although not in slices.  Great option for lunch to get slices of pizza and the pizza is good, not full of grease!"}
{"text":"If I could just not give it any stars I would. When I asked about a combo his response was \"well it's there isn't it?\", I told him I was just curious because the # was marked out.  He then huffed and irritably grabbed the menu and slammed it down on the counter and pointed to it. At that point I addressed my children and said we were leaving.  He waved goodbye sarcastically, so I told him \"I could tell why business was booming\".  Considering there was one other person in the place during lunch. Rude is an understatement.  I have never tried the food and I will never.  If that's how he treats his customers,he will never receive a dime of mine."}
{"text":"Good quick service.  I have had delivery service & have eaten in at their restaurant.  The delivery was fairly quick, pizza was hot. The restaurant was clean, service was friendly.   Pizza was fresh, hot."}
{"text":"Even though the food was good. The staff was rude as hell. Don't think ill come to this location again."}
{"text":"Great pizza. There are plenty of toppings on the pies. The salad bar is nice also. Above all, the service is great."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza for a reasonable price. Definitely a step up from the other chains nearby!  Delivery guy was friendly and courteous. Pizza delivered within 45 min of ordering on a weeknig"}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews, but read them often when looking for places to eat. I have lived here in Phoenix for 1 year now, and this is THE best pizza I've had. This will be my go to place for pizza, hands down. We got a large cheese (it's Friday during lent=no meat) along with bread sticks. We did ask for extra cheese and sauce since we weren't getting other toppings."}
{"text":"Barro's is a wonderful CHEWY pizza.  I have to get that out of the way, if you don't like chewy than you won't like Barro's, or at least not the pizza.  The sauce is a good consistency and I don't know why but I absolutely loved the cheese. I can't review any of the other dishes because I came there a little tunnel-visioned and hungry only for pizza.  They had some beer and a few televisions from what I can remember.  The place itself was clean but the tucked away arcade area looked a little dingy.  Service was nice, nothing wonderful, but nothing terrible either.  A nice place for some pizza while watching some sports I guess."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok pasta ok wings ok salads ok  Service sucked one of them was mean to my sis when she worked there but she doesn't anymore. Enjoy if your going"}
{"text":"Very inconsistent.  Some days pizza taste great, other days taste horrible.  I don't understand why there's such inconsistency.  Maybe when they are busy they just don't care enough to check"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I highly recommend the BBQ chicken pizza. The crust is perfectly cooked with just enough BBQ sauce, far better than any other that I've had. I've also had their mozzarella sticks and the cheese breadsticks and you really can't go wrong with either of those.   I've order delivery once and been to the location. Delivery was pretty fast (45 minutes on a Saturday night) and the delivery person was very friendly. The location is also very welcoming with a good amount of booths and tables."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza!! Been eating Barros pizza for over 20 years. It's so delicious!! I always order mine with a little extra pizza sauce and a side of Ranch dressing. When delivered, it is still hot and fresh. I love this place. The lunch specials are cheap and the fountain soda is a perfect mix of carbonation and syrup. I've traveled a bit and I LOVE pizza. Every time I get pizza somewhere else, it is inevitably compared to Barros.....i.e. almost as good as, not even close to, reminds me of, nothing like, a distant second to etc etc.   (DISCLAIMER: I worked there for a few months when I was in high school, so I may have a small bias toward it. But when I introduced my husband to it several years ago, it instantly became his favorite as well). Good old pepperoni is my favorite and my kids' favorite. My husband likes Meat Lovers and my folks get the Veggie Special. We are NEVER disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly staff, and on time delivery. Better than the other major chains with sauce, crust, and cheese. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I had pizza delivered to our place of work. I phoned in the order and asked to pay for each of our pizzas separate. The first order was more expensive than the prices listed on the website. Also, we each got charged the delivery charge since we paid separately, even though it was part of the same order and delivered to the same location. Once the food arrived, it was delicious. I like Barro's and will eat there again. I'll probably just pick up my order next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited  Barro's several times since it opened and we have had carryout on several occasions.  I love their pizza and my wife has had their ravioli several times.  Definitely a great place to eat and a great addition to Laveen."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch with my nine year old.  A good neighborhood pizza joint.  We each got a slice and a drink and split a dozen wings. Very reasonable prices- our tab was around 16 bucks. Very good pizza and the wings were cooked perfectly and were of a god size..  Their \"medium\" buffalo wings were a little tame, next time we'll go with hot.       It's no frills  counter service.The staff was pleasant and the food came quickly.  Not a spectacular \"can't miss,\" but worth a try if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob and have to say this place is good.  I've always liked ny style pizza but they have much better pizza than other places out here. The lunch specials are cheap and they have a salad bar.  It's nice to find a place that makes good, tasty, quality pizza in az."}
{"text":"If you know anything about anthem you know there is an obnoxious over abundance of PIZZA. Barros however, has to be my favorite. Not for the pizza. In fact until recently I didn't even eat their pizza, nor because of this location, but because I'm from back east and this isn't true GOOD pizza to me. So why give 5 stars you're wondering ? Because there's nothing I love more than on a Friday night coming into this lovely , clean, and friendly location, ordering a bunch of wings with my family and friends , maybe a small pizza , maybe a salad, maybe even a sandwich, and having a great time with quality food. Barros wings are my absolute favorite. Between the consistency, the sauce, and yes I like getting celery on the side of my wings. Any alteration, any add on, there's no grief from the employees and I've not once had an order made wrong and I have ordered here every other week for the past two years. Really great experiences. And I like their new thin crust ! Thanks Barros !"}
{"text":"I gave Barro's Pizza one star bc there wasn't an option for zero stars.  We ordered take out pizza only to find our pizzas literally floating in grease.  The pizza AND the boxes were completely saturated with grease -grease running out of the box onto the floor!  I returned them to the store at Higley & Queen Creek & asked to see the manager.  I was told they would remake my pizzas & the manager was coming.  The manager never came to see me.  I was told \"sorry 'bout that\" from the young girl at the counter.  When I got home with my new pizzas I found the same mess ... $25 of pizzas had to to be thrown in the garbage!! We live only 1 mile from Barro's.  Will never return!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!   Everyday we go their for lunch specials and love it.   The girls in the front are so nice time after time.   It's nice to see companies hire people that care about their job"}
{"text":"Their pizza is fantastic! I was honestly shocked by how good it is. They have a slightly \"chewy\" crust with great toppings and at a very fair price. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've been able to find around here. The crust is delicious and the cheese is top notch. Their wings are above average, nothing crazy. But the pizza is what you go here for. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch.    Lately their take out pizzas have been super greasy and just not good.  Used to love getting the thin crust but last time it was so greasy, it seeped through the box and we ended up tossing one of them.  Not even enticing for cold leftovers which I love.    Next time will have to find out what's making them so greasy and order differently since I like their lunch time pizzas."}
{"text":"I usually go to this place just for the cheap lunch deals. And since the pizza is always awesome I never got anything else off the menu. Finally decided to try they're wings so I went with the Spicy BBQ. To my surprise they were actually somewhat spicy! And the BBQ taste was good too. I'm definitely going to have to try more off they're menu."}
{"text":"Their white pizza is to die for! Best one I've ever had. And if you love crust like I do, this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Authentic back east Italian pizza! The regular crust is better than the thin crust. The sauce, cheese and toppings are really good.   The wings are very good, but not the best. I haven't had any sandwiches there yet.  This is far better than virtually any other pizza you'll get in the Phoenix area. The only other I would suggest trying is Niccoli's near 16th St & Bethany home."}
{"text":"Every time I order to go from this Barros, they say 15-20 minutes and it always takes 15 minutes more.  Today I showed up after 45 minutes and it was not ready yet.  It has been 50 minutes and I am still waiting and typing this review.  If my wife didn't like there pizza, this would be the last time.  Looking for a better pizza place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since it opened, and went to the previous location prior to them moving to this power address. I hate to say this, but their pizza and wings have been steadily declining, and tonight the food was down right inedible. The wings were so over cooked and cold, I could not even cut them with a fork. And I have had better frozen pizza than what was given to me by Barro's tonight. This location is so convenient for me, but unfortunately this is being taken off the \"pizza spots\" for our household. So disappointing."}
{"text":"It's funny how one bad day and rude service can take a place down several notches.  I ordered here last week and recieced two burnt pizzas. This was a first as I have never called them to complain about any minor mishaps..oops you put onion on my salad I can take it off...two burnt pizzas wouldn't have promted a poor review either but poor service has done just that. I called to explain the situation. I was told that I should speak to a manager. I again explained that not just the gluten free but both crusts were burned to the point that each bite was pretty groce. It tasted like the bottom was charred because it was. The manager said that he was sorry and that he actually checks pizzas before they go out. In his defense he offered to send two new pizzas out.  I told him that there was no time as I had ordered these for a meeting and needed to leave again. He said that he was sorry and that hopefully next time it would be better. I was offended and irritated by his nonchalant attitude and won't be ordering from this location again. Btw I will be sure to write raving reviews for my fav Barros in the valley consistently superior service!"}
{"text":"I found out that I have a sensitivity to gluten a few weeks ago and to my surprise I enjoyed the gluten free pizza more that the regular. The staff is always friendly and polite. Can walk here from work so it's nice that they are both speedy and efficient!"}
{"text":"Hands down best hand tossed pizza anywhere!  Great and tssty pepperoni and Italian Sausage, fresh garlic, and many fresh veggie toppings. Many toppings to choose from so your favorite is probably here. Their crust is also excellent! Like crispy fresh loaf of bread. Only place where I never have any leftover crust. Nice salad bar. Sandwiches good, Chicken strips okay ( changed about a year ago  from excellent ones). Lunch is also a strength here as you can order fresh slices in combos with the salad bar and drinks all for 2.50 to 4.75, along with regular menu. Also has good pasta. Family run chain that definitely does it right!"}
{"text":"Pizza maybe good, but delivery SUCKS.  And then when you call to check the status they say \"Your on his list, just be soon\".  WTH does that mean?  I asked for an eta. This happens everytime I get delivery and if this is anything like the other times, it will be cold.  Very frustrated.....AND you can't order online.  What pizza place doesn't offer that?"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are very inexpensive and the cheese pizza is really good. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, stop in for the lunch special. They recently remodeled the inside of the restaurant which is a plus."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I wasn't sure I'd like the food. There were only about two people in the restaurant. While standing in line, the lone grew quickly. Our pizza and wings came very quickly and they were both delicious! We ordered honey hot wings and the meat pizza. My friend ordered gluten free crust and really enjoyed it. The pizza was crispy yet soft and super delicious. I love the play area and will definitely be coming back. Bathrooms are simple, yet clean and acceptable."}
{"text":"Tonite I waited 45 minutes after I was told my pizza would be ready. Unfortunately there was a computer glitch and orders were getting lost in the system. These things happen nowadays so I wasn't too upset. When they called my name the Manager refunded me and everyone else who had to wait.  Very nice and unexpected. Thank You!"}
{"text":"What's to say it's barros?? Lol best pizza fresh ingredients and always the best ranch ever made. Got a large peperoni pizza and great as usual"}
{"text":"Best pizza found thus far in west valley !  Sauce is authentic and fabulous !  Have only done delivery - plan ahead - busy store and worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Friggin awesome pizza!!!!! I like getting no red sauce and getting garlic butter sauce instead oh my goodness!!!!!"}
{"text":"Employees were very rude when they charged me the wrong price for the pizza, when they told me a different price over the phone. I will not be back here. The manager made me feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD and SERVICE!!! I would recommend Barro's Pizza to anyone and everyone! I didn't think I would like it at first, since it is a franchise, but I was wrong, the food is great! Everyone that has waited on me has always been polite and eager to help. They always double check to make sure they have to order correct. If you want Great Food and Great Service, go to Barro's!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for good prices. Small quiet place to eat in or carry out."}
{"text":"I'm in construction and love stopping for lunch at Barros.  The pizza is great and the lunch specials are even better.  And with 50-inch high-definition televisions and a large patio, I would call it the perfect place for a team banquet. A special thanks to Tim Hoffman for pleasant greetings and recognizing my construction company as a quality one. Top notch service."}
{"text":"Ordered a X-large pepperoni pizza here just on friday so thats just 3 days ago. They said it would come in 45-55 mins which I thought was a little to long cause it would only be like a 10-13 mins ride. Even though the location is Litchfield Park its in an area where this store location is closer than the other one.  Well the pizza came out hot and warm so no complaints on that. My boyfriends little sister loved it and we are regulars here. I love their cinnamon sticks with tons of frosting.   The customer service was not to shabby I guess she wasn't very friendly but it doesn't matter to me all that much if my food is going to come out hot and yummy."}
{"text":"My go to place for  pizza. never disapoints.  Barros special is always good.  Plain cheese yummy."}
{"text":"Salads are fresh and the pizza have a great taste. Food does take awhile for it to be served but oh well."}
{"text":"Compared to other Barro's locations, the food is not as fresh.  Sadly, there is a level of incompetence here.  Employees are either not trained correctly, don't know simple math, or management does not know how to properly display their prices.  You get a #4 lunch special (2 slices of pizza and a drink) for $4.  Clearly states that.  Slices of the day, pretty self explanatory.  No where does it say that if you get the slice of the day that it's an additional charge of .50 something cents per slice.  Inconsistent is the word I would use here.  Some days I get charged $4.50 something.  Other days it's $5.50 something depending on who is working.  Extra one dollar isn't going to break me or worth bickering about but more a matter of principle.    If you're going to charge more for the slice of the day, POST IT!  Tell your people that $4 and tax does not equal $5.50 to $5.80!"}
{"text":"Barros Pizza is the only pizza that my husband and I can agree on (wish there was one in Wisconsin). We always have it delivered and they are always on time. We usually order way ahead of when we want it and they never fail us.  Since we don't want the same things on our pizza I always order half and half and for us it is PERFECT!!"}
{"text":"Do not order the ravioli! The ravioli was stone cold in the center and was obviously store bought. I never send back food but they were really nice about it & served me wings instead. Very nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pizza, tasty pizza, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm pizza.  Decent toppings, nice crust, not greasy but not too dry, fast. Pizza."}
{"text":"Love Barros!   great pizza, great service, and the salad bar is awesome! I also like the price! Great deal for the money."}
{"text":"Pizza was great,this location only sells beer by the bottle.  Mixed crowd from families, firefighters and guys catching a game on the tv's."}
{"text":"The pizza is perfect and the wings are to die for!  They always provide the right amount of ranch portions and they serve crisp fresh celery.  Anytime I order they know what I want and can ask if I want the usual.  I appreciate this Barros so much!  I will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"I had some chicken onnion pizza. it satisfied my pizza craving. they have good tea there. the place was clean. dead and empty but nice staff.   I would go again because the have pizza by the slice and a salad bar."}
{"text":"Tied as far as I'm concerned for best pizza joint in Anthem (with Streets of New York). The restaurant is clean. The pizza crust is good. LOVE the wings!"}
{"text":"My family and I moved to Anthem last summer from California.  We love pizza and Barro's pizza is the best. Great service."}
{"text":"The pizza is five star but the customer service is horrible! The girl at the cash register is very rude! I will be going to a different pizza place or a different Barros location because of this."}
{"text":"Oh how I'd love to give this a five because I love this place! We went in twice in a week and both times my boyfriend raved it was the best pizza he had ever had. He loved the wings also. I will always go back to Barros, but most recently when I was here my pizza came out not very hot. I ordered a gluten free one and I think they finished mine about 10 minutes before my boyfriend's. Still good, but his looked incredible."}
{"text":"The staff accommodated our party of 30 wonderfully on a very busy Friday night. And the food was awesome! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza awesome but so are the wings! The salads and cheese bread and everything else we've had here we have always enjoyed! We continue to go back because the food is always great and the service is always awesome.  We recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went to the Williams field location to eat, but they were slammed. I called this baseline location to see how long of a wait it would be if I orders 3 large pizzas and they said 20-25 minutes.  When I got there there was no line and only had 2 families in their lobby.   To make this short... We waited 1hr 10 minutes for our food. They prioritized the take out orders, rather than the eating in patrons. There was no apology and more of a... Can't you see we're busy attitude... Every time I inquired about our order being ready.   Don't make promises that are an hour off.   Williams field location are always great."}
{"text":"Went to get pizza for lunch. Got one pepperoni and a sausage. They both were still in the oven which is fine but when they came out people that ordered after me got there's and I was left with both pep or wait another seven minutes for another sausage to come out. Last time I'll ever go there. Not only that but then the girl at the counter was rude and made it seem like they did nothing wrong."}
{"text":"I live about 2 blocks away from the restaurant. So I can't understand why everytime I order delivery it's cold. Well maybe not cold but certainly not hot. I agree with other reviewers the restaurant smells like sewer and the girls at the cash register are rude."}
{"text":"I started eating gluten free pizza a few years ago, mostly because my son and daughter are gluten intolerant, and I wanted to see how it would taste.  Much to my surprise and delight, it was really tasty.  I liked the slightly thinner, toothy texture of the crust and most of all, I felt fantastic after eating several slices.  I was full, but not bloated, and felt great the next day, not how I usually feel after eating regular pizza.  Needless to say, about once a week, when my husband and I were exhausted and wanted to spoil ourselves, we would get a GF pizza each.  The Happy Valley/Lake Pleasant location was always busy, with great service, and perfectly cooked crusts when we ordered them well done.  After moving south a few miles, we were excited to find this location within a 5 minute drive of our new house.  After three tries, I have to say that I will never order pizza from this location again.  The first visit, I expected the same good pizza I was used to, so I didn't check it, and got home to find a really undercooked crust, with too much cheese (which didn't help the over-moist crust) and mostly cool toppings.  Too tired to return, I muddled through.   Second chance Barro's, but again, undercooked and soggy and cold.  (Remember, it's only 5 minutes from my house, and I arrive when they tell me to and always have to wait)  This time, I had a little more energy, and was a lot more hungry, so I brought my pizza back.  I told the person at the counter that I had ordered the pizza well done, and it was not only not well done, it was undercooked.  She took the pizza back to the kitchen, and a large man who said he was the manager came out.  He said he had cooked the pizza and that it was well done.  He was agressive and rude, and basically told me that I could take the pizza or leave it.  I was shocked and told him I wanted a pizza that was cooked well done and that was not well done, so after telling me again that I was wrong (whatever happened to the customer is always right?)  he grudgingly agreed to make a new pizza.  Waiting for 15-20 minutes, I kept thinking \"there is no way I'm getting a well done pizza when they know I am sitting out here waiting for it\"   I took the pizza home and sure enough it was soft and not crispy at all.   Third chance Barro's - it had been many weeks, and I had forgotten about the cooking issues, so I grabbed the pizzas, (this time we were late per their instructions, but still had to wait 5 minutes) went home and sat on the couch and opened the box to find a soggy, cold pizza with the cheese barely melted.  I put it in the toaster oven for about 15 minutes, and it finally crisped up and got hot.  Finally it tasted like what I remembered eating at the Happy Valley/Lake Pleasant location!  Sorry guys, but if I want to cook my own pizza I'll make it with fresher ingredients and non-processed crust."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer until a few weeks ago.Order took 50 minutes for pickup, BBQ chicken pizza which we always order had to be thrown away and the rest of the order was barely edible.Called corporate office and left a message and no one returned my call.Then sent a letter that was returned twice ,so is guess customer service is not important. Need to find another place in Cave Creek"}
{"text":"Horrible experience every time I come in. Always a 5-10 min wait for a slice of pizza and never have any pizza ready. Any other Barros has pizza ready for people in a hurry which I was. Food is good but this location needs some better management."}
{"text":"Great place. Like their sauce and lunch specials are fabulous. Quick service for the times we have eaten there. Salad is decent but not the greatest, but way better than most pizza joints. Staff is friendly and patient when ordering. We will continue to return here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Barro`s for the lunch special for several years. For $4 you get 2 slices of pizza and a drink.  I got a slice of pepperoni and a slice of sausage both were fresh and had good flavor."}
{"text":"We live across the street from Barros, thankfully.  This is our go-to place for pizza and wings.  I'm not sure where in the world you can get better wings, and we usually get heavy meat toppings on the pizza, which always turns out great."}
{"text":"I really enjoy pizza and wings fro Barro's Pizza, and to think I found out about this place through my lady!  :-) They are also exceedingly fast at their delivery service (which is very good to me, prompt service that is), and I can also remember one time when my lady had placed an order, and they were running late, well when they got to our home, they automatically \"upgraded the order\" to a Large Pizza instead of a small one! Thanks Barro's.....  You are the bomb !!!  :-)"}
{"text":"As a native Arizonan, I grew up on Barro's pizza. Needless to say, you can't beat the lunch specials and the decently sized slices.   All in all, the food is good...now if you could just find a clean table to sit! Came here on a Monday afternoon. Wasn't greeted. Stood around so long waiting for someone to take our order that we almost left. Finally an employee came up to the register to take care of the growing line. Now I'm pretty easy so I was willing to let that slide, but once I got my food, there was not one clean booth to sit in. Literally. My group went back and forth from both sides trying to find a clean place to sit until we finally settled for a dirty booth that we had to clean OURSELVES! There looked like there were enough employees around to take care of the place, but one guy was too busy refilling his drink to take notice. My fiancé almost went up to complain, but it just seemed like a bunch of high school kids working so what do they care, been there done that. Glad I got to share my meal with someone else's trash. The girl at the front who had been taking orders the whole time came out a few moments later and started cleaning up. Either she's the only one with any drive at this place or they are severely understaffed.   In conclusion, pizza and wings are great, but if I have to eat next to someone else's trash again I will look elsewhere for some pizza."}
{"text":"First time here and not impressed ! Beer was flat , they don't have salad bar ? Why ? Waited too long for two pizzas on a  Thursday night ! Manager seemed non chalant about how we felt. Got a refund on beer but still disappointed ! Also drove quite a ways to get here and won't be going back !"}
{"text":"Ok, I'll be honest. I wasn't looking to go to Barro's tonight. I have never been to Barro's before. I  wanted NYPD pizza. Unfortunately, their wait time for pick-up was 40  minutes and I was only 25 minutes away. I decided to give Barro's a try when I found out their wait time for carry out was only 20 minutes. I am very happy that I did. I got a ham/pineapple pizza and it was very good. The crust wasn't greasy (crust can make or break a pizza), the sauce wasn't too heavy, there was a good cheese to topping ratio. I like the ham/pineapple at NYPD also, but it is at least $6.00 more.  I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"For the THIRD TIME! I spoke to Rylee today and to ensure I receive cheese and peppers and even though she was sure to let the driver know they never include them EVER!"}
{"text":"Made a visit for lunch last week on Tuesday around 2:30 pm. My mother and I were either going to go with the meal (salad and 1 slice) or split a small pizza. We decided on the meal , unfortunately we were given an old , hard slice of pizza. Will not return for lunch. The business should have made a new pizza or at least warn us the pizza we were about to order was not going to be fresh."}
{"text":"Alyssa is wonderful and sweet every time we go  she will take care of u!! Ryssa is the Manager and will also do her best to make sure u r completely happy before u leave. Supervisor Gabe is just as wonderful!!!Delivery driver Ethan is amazing thank u to all of u for your wonderful customer service. Thank U"}
{"text":"This place has not only screwed me over once but it has done it twice. First order a while back I ordered a thin crust pizza and it was so soggy and uncooked I had to throw it in my oven to finish cooking. So they give me a credit. I went to order and I used the 2 toppings and medium size and the manager tells me the chicken is a premium topping and that it's why I costs a little extra well they wanted $4.34 extra for a couple pieces of chicken! And it was also because I \"wanted a white sauce only\"pizza! Give me a break Barros. So then I request for a different pizza. and they still didn't get it right! Seriously, if you want the nastiest, worst pizza you have ever had come to this place. And I never right Yelp reviews only if a place is this bad."}
{"text":"My family loves barros pizza. Their pizza is on point and their wings are awesome. The staff is very nice and they keep the place clean. They have their own little section for kids so it's a great place to have a playdate and eat. we go here atleast 2-3 times a month. I love them."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Surprise.  We get Barrows every Friday night for pizza night with our kids."}
{"text":"We use Barros on mostly monday nights! We love them! Their delivery time is FAST and the food is delicious and fresh. Even the customer service is is kind and polite. I like how they will also give you extra plates and napkins or when you have extra guests. I like their daily specials also! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite pizza place since moving to the area a year ago, however things seem to be going down hill.  A few days ago I called for delivery and was told it would be 1 hour and 45 minutes, since I couldn't wait that long I told them no thank you.  Today I called and again ordered delivery and was told if would be an hour.  I asked if they were sure it would be just an hour as I needed to take my son to practice. I was assured it would be an hour.  It ended up taking an hour and a half, so my son had to eat a sandwich instead.  No big deal things happen and places get busy, I understand that.  When I checked the boxes I saw that the pizzas had crumpled up on themselves as if they were dropped or carried incorrectly.  I called to complain and was given a free credit for my next order.  So I guess the next time I have time I have an hour and a half or more to wait for pizza it will be free, however I still paid for the mess currently in my garbage can."}
{"text":"Totally disappointing. We have ordered pizza from here before and they are usually quick and deliver hot food.....tonight was different. Our food was cold and disgusting. What a disappointment! Im sitting here mad and hungry. Not a good way to spend a sat night."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see they were opening a Barro's near our home, I had eaten at the one near Thunderbird and 7th Street by my work and was a fan of the lunch specials.  The pizza is just right, not too much sauce or cheese.  And they have the best chicken wings in the area by far.  I recommend the honey bbq!  The delivery service is good, the pizza always shows up nice and hot and the service in the restaurant is great too.  The ladies that work there are always smiling and hover from table to table offering more napkins and checking to see if you need anything else.  If you live up near Lake Pleasant and Happy Valley, don't go anywhere else, Barro's is the best!"}
{"text":"Pizza good, but ugh,  flies drove us crazy, please do something about that! Real downer to evening."}
{"text":"Food was delicious... We ordered the regular crust on our pizza but I should have ordered the thin crust... The wings were very good, I was impressed. The booths very comfortable and the staff was very nice and polite.... I would pick this place over Peter piper pizza any day..."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but I'm sorry tonight's cashier hates being at work. I'm sorry to ask for napkins and forks.  Thank you for tossing at me. Service terrible   I was asked to contact via email.  I gave my phone number. I received a call.  I returned their but not heard back"}
{"text":"We have had pizza from here for years usually a good pizza. Tonight was a different story took 3 times longer than usual to get our pizza and the end of the slice the crust was not cooked all the way. The girl to my plate to the manager and said she would be right back. I was expecting the manager to come make a visit but he asked her though the opening to the kitchen \" do we need to make another pizza \" I was unhappy after spending $35 .."}
{"text":"Great dough and high quality toppings. This is definitely our go to pizza place in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Reviewed: Pepperoni pizza  The thin, soft crusted pizza topped with a moderate amount of mozzarella cheese that seems to almost melt in your mouth was heavenly. The pepperoni slices were cooked to perfection, not too chewy nor too crispy. The pepperoni slices are large and moderately sliced, not thick at all, which makes for a good tasting pepperoni pizza. Pepperoni pizza lovers, search no more, come hither to the pizza promise land."}
{"text":"Very best pizza in town. Everything is good there. And the fact that they have slices makes everything even better. The service is OK in the bathrooms are clean what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"The best Pizza in Town and try the Hot Roast Beef & Cheese Calzone with Mayo & Musturd"}
{"text":"Always the same great food and drinks.  Been going to Barros pizza since the late 80's. still the best pizza and wings available"}
{"text":"While having a family dinner here tonight attempting to celebrate a birthday, an older gentleman came over to our table and threatened our family and small children out of nowhere. He kept trying to move himself closer to the children at the table and became aggressive when we wouldn't permit it. I wouldn't have thought any wrong doing from the restaurant except for the manager's response when he eventually came out to the ruckus. He explained to us that this man was a regular customer and was not right in the head. Dismissed us and when back to his office. I am concerned that this is a kid friendly restaurant where management isn't concerned with the safety of the small children or other paying customers.  We didn't even receive an apology.  Be aware this is not a safe environment and this was an intense/scary situation that I would not like to see happen to anyone else. Since again, this man is a regular customer and will be back. Police were called by my family, not the restaurant and I hope this man gets the help that he needs."}
{"text":"It has never disappointed me, it always delivers. It is one of the cleanest pizza places ever, I always get my pepperoni pizza with my winds and cold iced beer."}
{"text":"I love the chicken supreme pizza, though their antipasto salad is great too. Packed with meat and cheese. I've had delivery twice and it arrived during their estimated window. I'm happy I have a place this good close to home."}
{"text":"Haven't used this location since our horrible experience last Halloween and now I regret giving them another chance.  Was told 45 mins for delivery but after an hour and 15 mins I called to check on our food only to be told it would be yet another 15 to 20 mins.....   DONE!"}
{"text":"This locations is a family favorite. Great food, great location and even a kid friendly dining area for the little ones."}
{"text":"The pizza is always great and very easy atmosphere to bring kids.  They have a little wooden kitchen set up that occupies my little ones so I can actually sit down and eat.  The service was also very good.  Everyone was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time and found the pizza was really good. They have good customer service; very courteous and helpful. The only thing disappointing was they wouldn't allow us to takeout a cookie and ice cream, which is weird. I have never had a restaurant tell me I can't takeout something on the menu. It is for eat in only? I would look into that and maybe change that rule in the winter."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting 15 minutes longer for my pizza that told.  While waiting, I got to hear the girl behind the counter talk about turning down her boyfriend's sexual advances, take money from a customer whos hair she cut and brag about being the reason another employee quit.  I finally stood up and looked annoyed.  At that point she said let me check on your order.  Brought it right out saying he just cut it.  Unfortunately, she wasn't smart enough to whisper to her friends and instead, loudly said, \"that lady's pizza was just sitting back there.\"  Barros pizza is good, just stay away from this location.  Go to 51st and Union Hills!!"}
{"text":"The day after writing my prior review, I received a call from the manager who apologized for the problems we had. Excellent customer service!! Don't see that in many places anymore. We'll be going back for pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Our first time at this relatively new location.  Really good pizza, really slow service."}
{"text":"Pizza and beer.  That should be enough, but not enough for the yelp crowd....  We enjoy the pizza ....and the ravioli with meatballs is quite tasty.  The sauce is tangy and flavorful...   Their salads are a little \"off\", but I wouldn't be at Barro's for salad as my main course, either..."}
{"text":"Great Wings, Great Fluffy Pizza. Always deliver, just wish it closed later than 10pm (most days). Great value for the pizza and Wings."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! The staff is under trained on how to treat customers and amount of time I had to ask for something is just not normal, I've had better service at other barrow locations.. I will not step foot in this location at all!"}
{"text":"We have never been inside this location but do call in for delivery.   This is my go-to place for wings. I am a huge, huge fan of the sweet red chili sauce on well done wings for that nice light crunch. The large sized salads are nice and full with a perfect amount of fixins'. The large here could do a good four servings. Barro's is also the go-to for my husband when it comes to the mozzarella sticks.  The pizza itself is pretty good. The slices and crust are thick and at times the cheese is just as thick, you can pull it off in a layer. My husband loves cheese so that is the idea of pizza heaven for him. I am a light cheese kind of person. The cheese ravioli (with meatballs) is also a good choice and it comes with a side of garlic bread.  Barro's was the first pizza encounter I had when I moved to Arizona and to this day it is still a favorite."}
{"text":"I used to live in a different part of the East Valley and really loved getting Barro's pizza.  I like a lot of cheese and always order extra cheese, even if I have to pay more.   This location doesn't seem to understand that extra actually means to add more.  I've tried multiple times to see if they could get it right, but sadly had large bare spots.  I even tried their standard cheese to see if there was a difference.  You guessed it, exactly the same!  The other locations I've been to really do put extra cheese on so it really is obvious that the extra cheese is there.  I'd like to see this location match what the other locations and brand do."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, and not just because it was free :D  We had a coupon from a mailer and thought we'd try it, sooo good! Even my son who is almost 3 won't eat pizza from anywhere- but he ate Barro's.  The restaurant was clean and well staffed, very friendly and priced well considering the area, located in (N. Scottsdale). Very happy & will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best lunch deals out there. The pizza is always tasty and salad bar is an added bonus. The staff are always friendly and the decor is actually very nice."}
{"text":"Tried their delivery for the first time and will not order from them again. Food arrived with sauce from spaghetti leaking into the bag and all over some of the other food. Meatballs on the spaghetti were good, but the pasta was overcooked and the sauce just tasted like tomato sauce out of a can. Wings were undercooked. Garlic bread had very little taste... pointless to eat it. However, the salad was tasty with lots of meats, cheese, olives and peppers. We didn't try the pizza, but based on this experience, we won't be back to Barros."}
{"text":"I love Barro's.  Always clean and the food is fantastic.  The price is as good as the food.  The new Manger Mike is great guy and wants to make sure everything is done just how you like it."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza  is constantly good and, an Arizona favorite. Delivery is fast and the prices are under market for value."}
{"text":"This place has VERY BAD customer service !!!!! Only positive thing is the food is good. I don't understand why businesses treat their customers that way for delivery."}
{"text":"We just moved here.  At the end of a very long day we purchased some pizza for take out.  The pizza tasted so great ...that I could not stop eating it.  I guess my biggest problem was overeating.  This pizza was delicious!  Maybe I was just super hungry ... but it was great.  The only other pizza place I like around here is Oreganos, but to be honest their service is horrible.  Takes for ever to get in ...and then you have to wait forever for the food.  If you want a great pizza ...and don't want to spend 3 hours getting it ...then this would be the place I'd recommend"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE ! I didn't even have a Yelp account , but I convinced myself to make one just to leave a review for this place .  My friend and I have came here for the past 2 years , at least twice a week . Super loyal to this specific location . So earlier today we came in for the lunch special , and we were denied a box for our salads . The manger had told us we were messing up his inventory , and had argued with us telling us we come in too much . Also , the older lady that's there EVERYDAY , has the WORST attitude . Every time we would come , in my father would tip her , and not once has she ever said \" Thanks ! \" or \" Have a good day \" . If you're looking for a family friendly restaurant, this is NOT it . SORRY BARROS for the loyal service , we will take allll of our friends and family to the Brothers Pizza across the street from now on !"}
{"text":"Holy fast delivery batman!! Smelled delish from the get go. The pizza was perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant is fast and friendly. The pizzas came out hot and delicious. Even when they got one of our pizzas wrong, they were even quicker to bring out a new one."}
{"text":"Snotty staff and horrible service. The pizza is always good but when its predictable that the staff will treat you poorly, I say go to Casanova Brothers pizza in gilbert instead! Same prices, better pizza and staff who remember your name!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of depressed that my Pizza took longer the expected. Other than that I really like that piece of it is good it's affordable! Just the wait it is irritating"}
{"text":"Excellent go to type of place to grab an average slice of pizza, wings, beer, etc. I've dined here for lunch and dinner numerous times. The staff have always been friendly, the food has been average but very consistent, and even when it's really busy the service is generally quick."}
{"text":"Thank you for accommodating my request for no cheese on my order!  My child has a dairy allergy and when we order pizza, we get one for him without cheese.  Another local pizza place would not make it without cheese so I cancelled my order there and called Barro's.  The lady who took my order was friendly, my order was correct, and it was made quickly (a big plus for it being a busy holiday weekend!).  Thank you, Barro's...you've certainly earned my business!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Barro's Pizza?  Possibly the best pizza in town! Friendly staff and fresh salad bar. Only problem... Everyone else is there getting pizzas and it might have a wait."}
{"text":"The pizza at this place is very good. I would stick with that. Came in to dine and ordered a spaghetti and meatball dinner. Asked the staff how large the portion would be for the spaghetti. She said it easily feeds two adults. Waited 25 minutes and still no spaghetti. Asked the waitress to check on our order and she said it was the next ticket item and would be no more than 2 more minutes. Ten minutes later the spaghetti finally came. The portion was good for only one person. The sauce was watery and the meatballs were overcooked and not soft. If you come here just get the pizza. Otherwise, very disappointed with the 35 minute wait on a very poor spaghetti dinner on a night that was not overly busy for staff to serve you timely and to make even a descent spaghetti dinner."}
{"text":"Great place that my boyfriend and I like to go to. We always get the ravioli. Love the passion fruit tea. Can't wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great Lunch special Clean Friendly Variety Catch a game!"}
{"text":"Great cheap Lunch specials! Pizza, salad wings and a drink under $8 I'll take it! I love the flavor the sauce and the cruse, not skimpy on the toppings either. Different featured pizza every day for the specials and it is usually fresh."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I all went for a family. It only cost us $25 for drinks and an extra large Chicken Supreme pizza.  Even though it took 20 minutes to get my pizza the wait was worth it. The Pizza was very good, and it came with a lot of cheese. Oh so good.    Will deffiently come back. The price and pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my family on Friday, October 20, 2017. They appeared to be a little busy for a Friday. Maybe some of the local schools had half days or no school. I sat at 1 of 2 clean booths with my kids while my husband ordered. Another couple quickly took the last remaining clean booth. They were a few clean center tables. There were 6 dirty tables in the restaurant when we arrived and trash on the floor. As we sat waiting for our pizza, many of the occupied booths cleared out and more customers poured in. There were two young women at the cash registers taking orders and no busser in sight. The bell rang in the window when some pizza was up. No one took it out to customers. About 5 minutes later the bell rang again. Again, no one took it out. We debated going to see if some of the pizzas were ours but ultimately decided they possibly might not be so we waited. A young man came out after several minutes and brought us our pizzas (which had been there waiting in the window). Luckily, they were still hot. The pizza was okay, but to be honest the mismanagement of this restaurant had all my attention. There were now no clean available tables. Customers that had just ordered were moving trash off tables to another dirty table so they had somewhere to sit. I watched a man carrying a baby carrier trying to clean off a booth so they had somewhere to sit. Three groups of people just pushed the used cups, dirty plates, and napkins off to the side. They all looked disgusted. One of the girls behind the register brought a buss tub out and I thought \"Oh finally!\" but no, she just brought it out, looked around, walked back behind the counter, and then came out again, moved the tub to another table, and then noticed there was a wait of 1 person at the register (mind you there was already 1 girl at the register helping someone else) and went to help the person waiting. What's the hurry if they have nowhere clean to sit? She didn't put a single plate in the buss tub or throw away any trash. We were astounded. We were now finished with our pizza. As we left, I counted 16 filthy tables, and several additional groups that hadn't even eaten sitting at tables with trash pushed to the side. The whole time we were there no employee came out to clean up. I even heard a girl at the register tell the other girl someone called to say they needed somewhere to sit, and still, they just looked at the mess, and found anything else they could possibly do besides clean up. Clearly no manager on deck,  or maybe just one that they may want to consider firing."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for the first time, and wow everything was amazing! We had their traditional wings and a large chicken supreme pizza which was very yummy!!! The staff was very friendly and even though the diner was pretty busy we received our food in timely manner!!!! We'll definitely be back and recommend this place to our friends!"}
{"text":"Thank u Nick!!!! Always wonderful & Alyssa is definitely a keeper she's the best u have!!! The only thing I would suggest is new menu items but that's it like French Fries ( parmesan fries&Fried zucchini) just a lil idea ."}
{"text":"At times we have had great pizza but when they are busy the pizza has less toppings and not so great. Service could be better and I do tip. Now a charge for dressing, they use to provide. I have learned not to tip since service has changed."}
{"text":"Once again I call to place an order and the phone is busy. Kept trying several times and still busy. Happens EVERY SINGLE time! So we end up ordering from the Litchfield location but they don't deliver to us, so we have to pick it up. How does any business still have a busy signal????"}
{"text":"Pizza is one of the few things in life that even when it is bad, it is good. I would like to give them 5 stars because we have seen this place at its best and they rock. However, there are times they make Pizza Hut seem like an upgrade. McDonald's makes millions not by making a great hamburger, but by making a consistently bad burger. You know what to expect, and the expectation is consistently met.   Our family and friends incorporated this restaurant into our routine and have been there many times. Occasionally we'll have them deliver, but usually we hang out there. They make a good pizza at a fair price. Place is generally well kept and service is friendly and courteous. You can watch the Diamondbacks AND Suns while the kids watch Nick on the big screen. It's a family restaurant and you are likely to experience someone testing boundaries. If you can't stand being exposed to the process of child rearing they deliver.   You are reading this because you should be forewarned: When they are busy they are not very good. The timing is off, the food quality is poor... ok, they're bad. Yogi Berra once said of a popular restaurant: \"Nobody goes there no more, it's too crowded!\" If you can walk up to the counter and order, then easily find a table - you'll enjoy the experience. If there is a line and no tables - it's a gamble.  If you've been and left without joy, give them a try when they're not weeded.   Recommend light sauce and extra cheese with whatever toppings appeal to you.  Gluten free unlikely to affect you appetite, tastes good enough to add a pant size."}
{"text":"Every time I order pizza it always ready right on time and of course the taste is unbeatable! Have been going here for years and have nothing but positive things to say!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and even better wings. I recommend the sweet red chili flavor! Good, consistent service keeps us coming back almost weekly!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a week for lunch.  The pizza is always amazing, and they have a great lunch deal.  The reason for 4 stars? The staff is rude and impersonal."}
{"text":"A lady named E (what name tag said) was a complete bitch, tried multiple times to make me and my buddy feel stupid. She's extremely rude and aggressive. Probably won't come back to this location just because of her. She should not be working in customer service."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery pizza for our first try of Barro's and it was good. Although for thin crust, the crispiness did not survive the drive.  I like the flavor and want to try eating in.  I am not a fan of most delivery pizza but this was good."}
{"text":"Have eaten here or ordered from here religiously  Place is consistently good. 24 bone in or bone out wings deal with an XL 1 topping pizza is a quick and delicious meal for you and your pals!   I have gotten their medium one topping only $9.48 +tax which is perfect for just the two of us, its always hot, delicious, a bit greasy(which makes it good) and has the best cheese, to bread, to meat, to crust ratio out of any pizza I have had.   By far this place is great for a quick slice, a meal, or for some party food while the game is on."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place, and I have to say, the Pizza is delicious.  It is really hard to find a location around here that sells good tasting pizza and I'm so happy to say that I have found it.  The prices are reasonable as well as the delivery fee.  My husband loved the wings, great tasting as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place for gluten free pizza, and service. Toppings are quality and delicious. Normally never have any problems, but today our 2 GF pizzas arrived cold, and pretty raw when we ordered for delivery. I called to let them know, and was transferred to a manager named Andy. He was very very nice and no attitude whatsoever, and offered to make it right with no hesitation. Since we could easily pop the pizzas in the oven, we opted for his offer of a credit for next time. Really satisfied with how this was handled, and will definitely be back soon. Pizza is really good here!"}
{"text":"Very good. Tastes homemade. You can taste the fresh real ingredients. Unlike the pizza chains. Will definitely go back. Pizza is amazing and I know pizza lol."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Michael Barrow he, and his family own all of these local pizza places.  The recipe is a family tradition. They are true Italians, if I do say so myself.  The have a rich tangy sauce with a fluffy crust.  They are one of the only places that actually give you extra cheese if you order it (looking at you Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa John's). The extra cheese pizza arrives at least a pound heavier (honestly, try it).  Toppings are fresh. Perfect pie!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town!  I have yet to try pizza and wings that is better than Barro's!  We usually get the two large one-topping pizza in chicken and meatball with thin crust.  It's a great special and they usually have a pretty quick delivery!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer!  I got the Kona Pizza with the terriyaki, pineapple and chicken and it was fantastic!  The staff is always great and eager to help.  I love the Ricotta pizza, probably one of my favorite pizzas ever.  Great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"Crappy service.  Came to pickup an order and sat for 15 min only for them to give me a pizza that was ready the whole time.  I  asked for a new one and they acted like I did something wrong"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza, alas, since moving to the east coast in '01 it's a rare treat afforded only on trips home.  Seriously, though, Barro's has the best chewy flavorful crust and sauce.  They are generous with the cheese and veg (my preferred toppings) and the veg are fresh and tasty.  This Greek style pizza they have out east just can't compare to a little taste of home."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. Placing an order can take forever, the teenagers working the front are always slow and rude. Slight change in associate attitude this place could be a 5 star."}
{"text":"Love this location, my family and I have movie night every week and we always order pizza from here, ive never had a problem with anything, the wings are good,the mozzarella stickes are yummy with their marinara sauce, the veggie pizza is amazing! I love the cheese,the pepperoni,everything really and its quick for pick-up always 15-20 mins and is always ready when I get there!"}
{"text":"They require a $10 minimum now when ever you place an order for delivery so if you're close enough, just opt to pick it up instead and send your self some money.  Barro's is my favorite pizza place ever. I'm a simple gal and enjoy plain cheese and theirs is pretty friggen awesome."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!!!! ...But that's all that was awesome. Reason for the low rating was not for the food, it was for the customer service we received.  We placed our order at 3:50pm, for a 4:45 pick up time- We got to the restaurant at 4:40pm and was told it would be about 5-10 more mins. after she looked and saw that our order was not in the warming rack. About 5 more mins later  she said it'll be another 5-10 mins and offers us water.  I asked why our order wasn't ready upon pick up she said the wing dept forgot to put the wings on to cook. BUT~ 4-5 people came in and picked up their orders while we waited, orders of pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I love Barros! Their pizza is awesome, love the dough and they use quality stuff to top it. Their wings are my favorite, that perfect balance of crunchy and smothery. Even their sandwiches are good, lots of stuff in them and I love that they use the shredded mozzarella cheese.   We order from them more often than I would care to admit and they are probably the most consistent pizza place I have found. They are not the cheapest around, but I am a believer in that whole \"get what you pay for\" philosophy.   They seem to have really good luck with the drivers, they are always cool.  I hate when the person dropping off your food looks like they should be in an anti-drug ad so I give them points for not letting that aspect slide over time.   All in all damn good for a pizza night at home!"}
{"text":"As a soccer team manager Barro's is always one of our favorite \"go-to\" spots all over the Valley, but the service this time was exceptional!  The Manager, Tim, allowed the team to take over a large party size room with xlarge flat screen tv (separate from another main dining room) even though we arrived early and they were still setting up for the day.  They have awesome lunch specials that can not be beat both price wise, fast service and quality-and the salad bar is extensive and even includes diced ham, real bacon and lots of veggies etc.!  It was the perfect spot to hang between soccer games at Reach 11!"}
{"text":"So I was in town & had some Barro's pizza (of course)  Suggestion to the owner: Is there anyway you can creat something for the traveler?? like vaccume sealed pizza or something??  I wanted to order a mid size pizza to take it w/me to Dallas then I thought about carrying pizza box through security & sitting in the airplane making everyone's mouth watering won't be fair so I didn't do that (actually my BF kept saying \"they won't let you carry it!!\"  Next time, just to prove him wrong, I am going to order one & take it with me to Dallas!)  .  It's getting too expensive to fly out to AZ for your pizza.  Maybe you can open one here in Dallas or help me open one! Or better idea, traveler's from other State who provides airline ticket stub get's 20% off!  That is a great idea! BTW, did I tell you that no other pizza place like Barro's in Dallas???  Some say true italian pizza is amazing but honestly, I had a pizza when I was in Venice & nothing like Barro's. (see Barro's!  I love your pizza this MUCH! :)   )  Oh also, it is a very good idea you guys have very pretty girls & handsome guys at the front! I remember this one gal who was helping us she had the MOST beautiful blue eyes I ever seen.  I had to tell her \"I am totally straight but OMG! Your eyes are just beautiful!!\" Can you imagine Asian like me having aquia blue eyes??? That will be totally exotic! (sorry i got side tracked)   Any how, about Barro's pizza, you guys are just awesome! I am planning to make another visit soon & can I get a 2nd pizza for free??  with all the free advertisement... LOL just kidding.   All I can say, I sure miss your pizza."}
{"text":"Just moved to Surprise and after a looong day of moving, decided to get a delivery pie and some wings.  Prompt delivery, friendly order taker, and a good meal. Kind of expensive, but I liked the celery add for the wings; and the veggie pie and wings were very good, worth the money."}
{"text":"pretty dang good, I was pleasantly surprised with the wings! they were crispy and well fried, the way I like them."}
{"text":"Best pizza in surprise. My family and I love the crust and the specialty pizzas are a nice change from the sea of sameness found out in the pizza chain world."}
{"text":"I love Barro's all over the Valley, but this one is closest to home.  Really good pizza, and decent prices.  The only ding on it is that the wings aren't the best around.  But if you're looking for a good pie in an area that is extremely far from NY or Chicago, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"Very good- I like getting the white pizza on half and another flavor- like the special(like supreme) or the spicy chicken if you like hotter sauces....quick for takeout too!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood.  We received a \"free large pizza with one topping\" coupon.  So we tried it.  We are hooked and will be back for more!  The pizza was cooked perfect.  The cheese just the right temper. The side of bone in hot wings we ordered rocked! Perfectly prepared and tons of sauce.  Our takeout experience was so good, I even called the manager Ryan and let him know.  [I rarely ever do that.]"}
{"text":"Riddle me this: How have I lived in Arizona all my life and never tried Barro's? Ya, I'm not sure either. Its a mystery to me too. But it so happens that now I have. And let me tell you... I'm hooked!  Its a Friday evening. I am having severe insomnia problems currently and I slept a total of two hours the night before. Its 5pm, I'm starving, I'm exhausted, and all I want to do is just go home and pass out. So my husband suggests we order a pizza and order from a place we have never had before so that way I don't have to cook. I suggest Barro's because we have never tried it and it's right down the street. I go online, look for coupons like I do everywhere, and we decide on two special pizzas, veggie and hot wing (with mushrooms in place of the chicken) for the current coupon special price of $12.99 each. Twenty minutes later we drive down to pick up our pizza to avoid delivery charges. I check them in the car to make sure no chicken has entered the space of my pizza and we are good to go.   Let me tell you something about Barro's. Its freaking amazing. I can't believe I had waited so long to try them and I'm kind of sorry I did. The pizza dough is thick, but not too thick, and fluffy. The toppings are plentiful. Definitely the most toppings I've seen on a pizza for that price. Its three days later, and we are still eating leftovers. It doesn't take four pieces of pizza to make us full like those other guys. Two will do it for us. The hot wing pizza is so freaking good. Hot wing sauce covered with mozzarella and cheddar cheese topped with mushrooms. You have to try this thing at least once in your life. I miss eating hot wings sometimes but this satisfies that craving. Its spicy and cheesy. So good!  My husband said to me that this should be our new delivery place whenever we want pizza. I agree with him."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch with my 3 yr old son who wanted pizza so bad. First they do have pizza slices and the price is pretty reasonable:-) Our server Amanda was super nice.  We had pizza and salad and it was great...would definitely come back:-)"}
{"text":"Pizza made for mindless Hobbits. Bland, no flavor. Nothing great. Little Caesers is a step ahead. That should tell you something."}
{"text":"This was great surprise! Went in after a late night football game. This and McDonalds was the only thing open. Decided to go here! Pizza was very good. The toppings were plentiful and the pizza was packed with so much cheese. Next time I'm in town I will definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"This was my third time trying delivery at Barrios...no more!  Once again they delivered the wrong order and what they did deliver was a soggy, wet pizza!  It was so greasy that all the cheese and toppings slid right off of the undercooked dough!  Not good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their automated phone system hangs up on you and they don't care.  The manager talks down to you as if he believes you are an idiot, and it's incredibly unprofessional to talk to an irate guest covered in sweat and flour."}
{"text":"Love barros pizza generally but this store smells like sewage. Ordered two slices. They were not even hot."}
{"text":"R you guys serious? This is the worst pizza... It's like petesfish and chips every one is stuck on it and it's out right nasty..."}
{"text":"First time ever ordering or coming into the store. When we showed up to pick our order we were greated right away by Daisy Gaba at the register with a welcome! And smile. We asked several questions and she was able to answer them without any issue. Until I asked about them having any garlic dip. Daisy wasn't too sure so she asked another coworker who happened to come up to the register to answer the phone. She looked like she was on a break or on her way out the door. I didn't catch her name but she ignored Daisy when she asked about the garlic dip. I thought that was a little rude. Daisy ended up asking the cook in the back and he was able to help her. I had reasured Daisy that it was ok and thanks for going the extra mile. We paid for our order and for a moment Daisy couldn't find it. We let her know that we might've been early and that we'd wait. Luckly she found it with help from the cook in the back. It was in a delivery bag. Lol! Thank goodness we got there prior to it going out the store. All in all, from ordering by phone to walking out of the store it was pleasant and timely. The pizzas were made correctly and tasted great. We will be back in or order again in the future. Thank you Daisy for your smile and great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place has good food, but as far as the service goes, it sucks. I ordered two pizzas and wings that came with two small containers of ranch. When I asked for more ranch they told me it would be an extra 50 cents for each one... seriously? I just spent 60+ dollars at your restaurant and you're going to charge me for extra ranch? Stingy much! On top of that I specifically ordered thin crust on both pizzas and they both came out with original crust... even the celery with the wings was old and brown. I'll stick to #1 brothers pizza on 75th and cactus!! They value their customers and have great food!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and I love their Italian sub! We order from them every Friday night and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Barros Pizza. I have been ordering from Barros since 1989. Definitely my favorite pizza! Pepperoni and mushroom is always a favorite here."}
{"text":"The hubs & I loved Barro's back when we 1st started dating & it was pretty much the only place we would get pizza from. After a while we got kinda burnt out on it & didn't order from them for quite some time. Last weekend I was in the mood for pizza & decided to call Barro's. I ordered us 2 large pizzas, 1 w/pepperoni & 1 w/ham & double pineapple, I also got 2 sides of ranch & a 2 liter of dr. pepper. About 45 minutes later our pizzas arrived hot & fresh. I usually prefer a thin NY style crust, but sometimes I crave their thicker crust which is delish. Total for everything was super reasonable at about $28 (not including tip). We'll definitely be throwing Barro's back into the pizza rotation!"}
{"text":"i love the pizza here..and there always friendly..yah they might be busy at times but its worth the wait..lunch specials are good and also there two one topping larges for 19.99 ohh man there wings are yummy also..must try"}
{"text":"Delivery service was so rude. Called to order a pizza for delivery and the lady taking my order was very persistent and had an attitude with me. Also gave me a time estimate of 45 - 60 min wait and were completely off. When delivery man came he was very rude and walked off as soon as we handed him the money without saying a word."}
{"text":"Love ordering pizza from this place usually pretty consistent. Unfortunately the past couple times it has seemed be very inconsistent Pizza light on toppings light on cheese I pay $30 for some pizzas I expect them to be covered decently. I think you need to get somebody managing your kitchen little better to make sure the consistency of your product is upheld to your reputation. Losing faith in your ability to provide me with a quality pizza shouldn't be that hard!"}
{"text":"Eh...  Ok, but not really inspiring.  Thin crust was THIN, and the toppings kind of slid off."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Do pizza by the slice busy so it's always fresh and staff is nice happy customer."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Pizzas we have eaten. Great flavors and great crust. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Although I do like Barros, today's experience was unlike any other. Arrived at 12:05, was going to do a lunch special with a slice and salad. They only had Hawaiian available and unfortunately I don't like fruit on my pizza. So I asked how long it would be until different pizza would be ready. The cashier/server stated there was only a Hawaiian in the oven being baked, because \"she\" (I'm assuming the cook) was on the phone but that she was getting them out as soon as possible. So I then ordered the meatball sub. She stated she would bring it over when it was ready. My order was placed by 12:10. It was 12:35 when the sandwich was brought out, by I'm assuming another cook. I did appreciate he had gloves on...25 minutes for a meatball sub, really? Why on a Friday at Noon would there be 1 style of pizza available for the lunch special? Late getting back to work with a now cold meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"We dine in and carry out from Barro's all the time. The pizza is great and service, a bit slow, but still acceptable. We love the kids area; mom and dad can sit back and eat while the kiddos play and/or watch whatever flick is on TV.. Safe to say we will be back."}
{"text":"Worst Barro's ever!! The service was horrible, the two girls working were rude and unfriendly. When we got there they said there wasn't going to be room for us but we found plenty of tables...they weren't that busy!  The salad bar was pitiful...there was hardly any lettuce left in the bowl. The lettuce that was left was sitting in a puddle of water. Many of the items to put in your salad were empty or almost empty. And they only allowed one trip to the salad bar. With the tiny bowl they gave you it was an absolute waste of money! We love Barro's and go to one down the street from us all the time. We went to this location for a small group gathering and will not go back! Still can't believe how bad it was! I would avoid going to this location unless they get some new, friendlier people to work there!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. It's absolutely what the doctor ordered for those nights when you want to just order a pizza. I particularly like the Barro's Special pizza. Gotta say I'm not a big fan of the wings here, they're kind of dry and have thin sauce on them."}
{"text":"The pizza is thick, cheesy and generously topped. Although the employee taking orders seemed to be overwhelmed with taking orders, the pizza arrived on time and satisfied everybody in our group. We would eat there again and we'd definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"i love this place. I am gluten intolerant and it is hard to find gluten free pizza. I have tried the competitors pizza and it not only did not stand up to Barros but the price was significantly higher. Barros often releases coupons which make the dining experience a great deal."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. We've been coming here for a while now. The pizza has always been the usual Barro's yummyness.   We usually get some wings and a lg black olive and pepperoni. It's always good!    The girls at the counter are always nice.   My son loves to play in the arcade and they even gave us our money back when one of the machines took his money."}
{"text":"After my negative experience at Barros pizza, Amy Barro contacted me and let me know that my experience was out of the norm and she put a credit on my account for a free pizza, motz sticks and cheesy bread. Because of her generosity I tried Barros again and was pleasantly surprised..our pizza was delish, and the rest although still greasy was much better than our previous order. Thank you Amy for going out of your way to make a customer happy! We will most definitely order pizza from your establishment again."}
{"text":"Great pizza--especially enjoyed the Kona pizza. Prices are reasonable and lots of nice fresh things on the salad bar. Anxious to come back!"}
{"text":"They delivered fast, the food was piping hot and delicious. Prices are decent. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best dang lunch special EVER.  2.50 cents gets you 1 slice of pizza AND a drink...  3.50 cents gets you 2 slice and a drink...  You can't beat those prices period.  The quality is awesome, and if you're looking for something different, check out there specialty slices for 50 cents more. BBQ pizza on Friday for lunch is amazing, there Hawaiian on Saturday is great, and my personal favorite, the hot wing pizza on Wednesday is my favorite!  I travel hear often, probably too often, my personal trainer hates this place.  its worth the extra 45 minutes on the tread..."}
{"text":"Happy to be the first to review with new location to an Arizona (Chicago?) institution.   What more is there to say other than great pizza and great prices? This location has only booth seating and brand new tvs for any type of sporting event. My place to watch the Stanly Cup finals in a few weeks? I think so!"}
{"text":"I love BARROS. The thin and thick crust options, the quality cheese, the variety of toppings, etc. I can go on for days about how well their staff (especially the delivery crew) takes care of us.  If you like MIDWEST style pizza with great service BARROS does the trick!"}
{"text":"I was there tonight and unfortunately received bad customer service...ended up walking out"}
{"text":"delivery has always been on point. their slice specials for lunch are reasonable, but I still prefer a fresh baked sausage pie. Always a crowd pleaser when we have company over. they are on speed dial."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a good price.  They play 80's music and I love that.  So why not 5 stars?  Two words, cleaning and stocking.  I was at this location twice this week.  Both times it was about 30 minutes after they opened and the glass windows and door to the outside seating area were covered with fingerprints and smears.  The floor needed to be clean both times.  Also, at this location you can bet the farm that the beverage area will be out of at least one or two things.  Most of the time there are no or only a COUPLE of napkins.  (Don't look under the counter in the beverage area because I have NEVER found extra napkins there.)  Straws and lids also tend to not be stocked but at least there are extras under the beverage station.    The staff is friendly but I agree with the one review that mentions that they need more supervision.  Work harder on keeping the place clean and stocked and offer a veggie slice on more than one day of the week and I will give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, please back off on the sodium.  Enough to gag a magot."}
{"text":"I've been going to Barro's my whole life, and this is the best location by far. The nicest employees (shoutout to Christina!! I think that's her name..?) best pizza and atmosphere. Bless Barro's."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza on 40th St. & Greenway never disappoints! I always get take out and my order has always been on point and the food has always been fresh!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is great! I have been there many times and never had a complaint."}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza in the Valley. The boneless wings are also great! Whenever I have visitors from out of town, I recommend this place as a casual pizza spot. Friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"The best el primo pizza joint I've had in AZ.  This place has it all, cheap, fast, and tasty pizza pies for your consumption.  They always deliver in 45, never had a 2 hours episode and I've ordered delivery probably 20+ times.  Pizza is so freaking delicious, not too greasy, put enough cheese, their ranch that you use to dip the crust after you finish the pizza must be home made that shit is awesome!  We order extra ones to use as dips for other food in our house lol... yea I sound like a fatass, but bro you don't go pizza when you trying to watch it, you want savory succulent heaven on a bread plate.... am I right... ahaha am I right!!    Anyway, get the hook up and take 25% off your takeout if you register with them online.  You want pizza... you want Barros.  Game Over."}
{"text":"We were on vacation here in Surprise for a few days and we just wanted to grab a quick pizza. This location was very close to our hotel. We are bummed that we only discovered this place on our last night visiting, because this was some of the best pizza we've ever had. I can usually find something wrong with any pizza I have, such as poor crust, bad sauce, too much sauce, not enough cheese, etc. So not the case with this place. We tried the meaty one on original crust and everything about it was incredible! Crust was amazing, toppings were so good, sauce was just right, everything about it was quality. We are now ruined thanks to Barro's. Every pizza we have from now on will suck and will not compare. Is it not enough that you Arizonians have all the sun, the In-N-Out Burgers, the Chick-Fil-As? We wish we had a Barro's where we live. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"great pizza, and very friendly staff. the video game was fun too!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Barro's since 1994. I'm sad to say, this location does not have things in order. From our lipstick lined wine glasses, to our frozen ravioli, and our antipasta salad coming out after my  family was ready to leave, we will not be coming back.  Thank goodness the pizza was still delicious."}
{"text":"If you like your pizza delivered soggy laying in a PUDDLE of grease this is your place. So disappointed will not be ordering there again."}
{"text":"I am a huge pizza lover! I just moved to the neighborhood and ordered a large thin crust pizza for it to get delivered I a PUDDLE of grease. The crust was so soggy I was gagging. My family"}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast delivery and the staff is always friendly. I've been coming to this location for years and it's still one of my favorites. They also have decent beer on draft if you eat there the San tan devils ale is a person favorite of mine and glad the had it on draft. Goes great with pizza and hot wings."}
{"text":"Pizza is always great! But today it took me 35 minutes to get 2 slices of cheese pizza. I wouldn't recommend going there if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. The pizzas always have the perfect amount of cheese and toppings. The crust is perfect. One complaint is that the cost is a little higher than I think it should be. Coming during lunch and buying the single slices is so convenient and a pretty good deal as far as lunch goes. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time ordering here. delivery was fast and the driver was extremely nice. ordered the Mega meat and bread sticks, will eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Service was below average. Very rude and not thoughtful. We had a build your own and barro classic both were pretty greasy. Thin crust was greaser than original. Both tasted good just way to greasy!"}
{"text":"Barro's Special rocks!  Lots of ingredients and a really good price of less than $20 for an XL special.  If you're looking for a simple atmosphere that serves good food, it's here.  While the decor is tacky, it screams family-friendly.  You'll find no short skirts here, sorry fellas.  This place also serves beer and wings.  Been here many times and will continue to frequent Barro's."}
{"text":"Great value for the price.   I come here because of the availability of food on a short lunch schedule.   You can sit down and eat even if you have to run errands during lunch.   I have been a frequent visitor for the last 3 years and never once have I experienced bad service! Kudos to the entire staff for making lunch enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I will not be coming back to this place again. It's too bad cause the pizza was half way descent.  First of all the floor has never been clean anytime I have been here. (2)  The front counter is totally unorganized and run by a bunch of high school kids. Orders a pizza and a side item of breadsticks under the sign that says \"starters\" I waited 35-40 min while both items came out at the same time. I spoke with the manager (Nick) His excuse was they both are cooked from the same place.  \"Does not make sense to call them starters then.\" The worst part was no apology or empathy.  He just walked away after a long wait he did not come back out again to check on anyone, not even his crew.  No not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, especially the Meat one, Amazing wings. Love the Sweet Chile. Cheap beer by the pitcher, especially the Devil's Ale. Antipasta Salad is huge and well worth the cost. Cheesy bread is great. Service is good enough for walk up ordering, plus you can eat at your leisure. Cool kids area. One of the best options in Laveen."}
{"text":"Great low-cost lunch specials. Great Wings and Pizza. A nice place to take your family... Pizza was a bit cold but they went ahead and corrected the problem"}
{"text":"Chase and Kegan were amazingly helpful and inviting, they went above and beyond to solve a very small issue and we are very happy with the results. The food was fantastic and the other workers were great too! Will always come back here! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could have had a product to review. After looking online for the nearest location, I called the val vista location.  When my phone order seemed to be going fine until I mentioned that I lived in an apartment. She told me that that store doesn't deliver to my location (less than 2 miles away) and directed me to the power location, which after calling told me that they to didn't deliver. I am disappointed, because my brother (who I'm apartment sitting for) mentioned how great the place was. I realized that it is a busy Saturday, but I thought not delivering to a location simply because of potential inconvenience seems wrong."}
{"text":"So I walked into this place waited 10 mins and no one came. One lady grabbed her own to -go container from behind the bar. One guy poured himself a beer. One of the craziest scene's I've witnessed new management is needed asap. Other location reviews are much better will try them out."}
{"text":"There pizza here is really good so are there wings.  the staff is very friendly the food comes out fast and the place is kept clean."}
{"text":"P.J. Must be a competitor trying to ruin all the great reviews. I have been a customer for almost 20 years, it is good dough and sauce, calzones, spaghetti, and a nice salad bar too. My husband loves all the meat to make your own antipasto salad, or we get the one they make to go with our pizza delivery.  Great lunch specials for those on a budget. If you are unhappy with something, you should let them know.  So, they can try to make it right.   When dining in, I have seen the staff remake a different pizza for a customer who wasn't happy with their choice of pizzas.  That is going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Have a wonderful experience there the pizza was fantastic and the pitcher  of Blue Moon is nice and cold and very inviting and the price is reasonable  love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff and great food. We come here all the time for the pizza, wings, salad, beer and wine. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Long time supporters of this brand. Heck, I ate Barros every day for lunch in high school at their moon valley location years ago. Now we live near Tatum and Dynamite and used to go to the branch near ace hardware although usually got delivery.  This review is for my experience today at the new location at Cave Creek road. Dined in with the kids and the pizza is good so they finished their slices and I went back for more. No more cheese. Okay. Paid for another slice and waited......and waited.....and waited. I finally go back and wait at the counter. Over 20 minutes for a slice of cheese during the lunch rush. When I mentioned the wait, I received a snarky response. No apology much less an attempt at customer service. Pretty disappointing especially with kids in tow. I guess we will stick with carryout and delivery. Maybe this location will improve. Can't really blame the kids that work there but Barros used to really strive to be better than just a pizza joint. I guess like many things, growth dilutes quality."}
{"text":"We keep going back here - and it gets better every time - if that's possible!  Excellent pizza! Crust is perfect every time, toppings generous, fresh, and \"real\", always ready exactly when they say it will be.  Thanks, Barro's!!!"}
{"text":"The wings and sausage pizza were really good. The atmosphere is great for adults and kids. I recommend this location to my friends."}
{"text":"Now where can you get 2 big slices of any topping pizza and a drink for $4.50. Great food, great environment if you like to people watch. To be to buy lunch under $5.00 isn't heard of any more unless it's greasy and doesn't taste good. The staff are always welcoming and the only recommendation I can give is since you have such a high turn over of customers which is a good thing. They just need to keep up and keep the table cleaned"}
{"text":"Slowest staff ever. Waited 20 minutes for a pizza. The girl at the counter told me it would be 'a couple' minutes when we ordered and i saw my pizza sitting in the back for at least 5 minutes before it was served. I was starving and they didnt offer anything to make up for their shortcomings."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my apartment, I couldn't believe it took me 5 months to go try it out.   A neighbor and I went here on a rainy Friday night and impressively the joint was pretty full. They have a small but cute little lit patio area but it was too cold for that. We order a large BBQ chicken pizza, a dozen mild wings and 2 giant beers. They give you a little stick with a number and bring the food to your table. Man, oh man, those wings were so good. The sauce was great and they give a generous portion of ranch for dipping. We demolished those and enjoyed our beers until our pizza arrived. It was the right amount of greasy and the crust was thing but built up on the crusts. I think it was like a wheat crust, very delish.   We couldn't finish the entire thing because we had monsterious beers to down too. I will def go back here. It's the kind of place you can wear sweatpants, a hoodie and no bra... how ironic, that's exactly what I was wearing.  It's a good place to take a bunch of hungry kids or a big family to enjoy for above Pizza Hut style grub."}
{"text":"This was an unfortunate experience. It was very busy and I understand the demands of a Friday night. But I did not expect there to be no ice for the iced tea, half of my order to be forgotten, and to be told that they cannot make a sub over lettuce per company policy when I had one last week. And then they gave us filthy plates with dressing smashed between them.   I have enjoyed Barros for many years and I purchase large numbers of pizzas from this restaurant for my school. But this evening strained that relationship."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and antipasta salad for delivery.  When it arrived and I opened the pizza they put the wrong toppings on it.  I called the location to let them know, I was actually willing to just eat the pizza. I wanted to just inform them of the mistake.  The manager got on phone and indicated he would make me a new pizza himself and send it over.  I had a new pizza in 15 minutes.  That is how you take care of customers.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious.  The customer service is above and beyond.  I will be eating here again for sure.  The food is very fresh."}
{"text":"Walked in at 2:45PM. Lunch special is from 11-3. Well this day lunch special was until 2:45. Didn't have any pepperoni left and they sure as heck weren't going to be bothered with putting another pizza in the oven. Thanks for the total lack of customer service Barro's."}
{"text":"Nice people, great food, friendly atmosphere, esthetically pleasing, comfortable, and easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Walked in and the place was busy.  Ordered pizza to go and asked how long it would take.  Was quoted 15 minutes, even with the crazy line.  Ended up waiting 40 minutes, with them demanding to see my receipt so they could see what I ordered.  Then, when calling out names, the workers thought it hilarious to call out the wrong name.  Usually come about twice per month...will not go back.  Wouldn't have cared if it was 40 minutes, but when you are told 15 and end up waiting more than double that with barely any apology, I can go to one of the dozens of other pizza places around me."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sub the other night and it was dry. There was no sauce on it at all. Something seemed a little off when the kid delivered it but I didn't pay any attention. Then when I sat down to eat my sub it was completely dry and disgusting. They're not usually this bad,  but come on, how do you forget the sauce?  I wouldn't recommend them anymore."}
{"text":"This is my families go to place for pizza. Its always taste great.The pizza has a nice thick crust and the sauce is very yummy. And its very a fairly cheap price They always have coupons coming in the mail. We can happily feed 9 kids for $30.The employees are always very friendly. And the delivery is fast!"}
{"text":"is this the same place that use to be in Irvine CA.......Great Pizza"}
{"text":"This is the best local pizza and not only that it is cheaper than most of the competition. Eaten there and had their home delivery dozens of times always a great experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had at a borros sad to say. Ordered take out via phone, they said would be ready in 20 minutes this was at 540pm, got there just before 6pm. I waited an hour and a half for my food. It would have been longer if I hadn't asked how much longer because my food was actually ready for 30 minutes! for whatever reason they never said my order was ready and left it in a warmer. It was 735 when I got my food and it was cold they didn't offer to replace it for hot pizza due to it being \"So busy\" I know I was not the only customer that was waiting that long, there were about 6 other people that waited the amount of time I did if not longer."}
{"text":"Just had the Hot Wing pizza from Barros, it was awesome. Not too hot but just enough spice to give it it a Hot Wing flavor. I recommend your next trip in, skip the pepperoni and try the Hot Wing pizza."}
{"text":"First if all Charlie Vagina is an idiot!! Second this place is much Better than Dominos, Pizza Hut, and little Caesars combined. Barros serves some of the best pizza all around the valley at decent prices."}
{"text":"Pizza is great here and I've been a loyal customer. Today we ordered pizza for delivery and the girl on the phone was extremely rude. I am disappointed at the lack of professionalism and the extra attitude. I asked for no marinara on the pizza, white sauce instead, and she informed me they never put marinara sauce on the pizza. I asked what she was talking about and she said they put pizza sauce on the pizzas, same thing......  This is the last time we'll be ordering from Barros."}
{"text":"I work near by and can always count on Barros to deliver in a very timely manner and the food is always hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been going to Barros many years there pizzas are Awesome so good, flavorful and you can tell it's made from scratch"}
{"text":"Chicago style THICK crust pizza!  YES PLEASE!  I've been going to this location since I was a small child.  At that time it was one of only a few.  They are now all over the valley.  I can't eat Barro's but once or twice a month because I'm scared of how much weight I might gain, but I always look forward to a couple slices and some wings.  They have a decent little salad bar that I sometimes stop in to for lunch.  They use all the ingredients from the pizza (peperoni, ham, mozzarella, onions, olives, etc.) to stock the salad bar.  I continue to give Barro's a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is so good and it's very low priced. The service at this location is also exceptionally good! My family comes here all the time and have been for years. This will probably always be our favorite pizza place! Love it!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but whenever I go the place is dirty (plates on so many tables, tables not washed etc.), and the staff is about as animated as drying paint.  At least they aren't rude, but I've never seen them go above and beyond their job to assist customers or even interact with the customers.  It's almost like you are bothering them from talking to one another.  I will go if it is a last resort, but there are plenty of other places I feel deserve my money."}
{"text":"This Barros Pizza is my go-to place for pizza.  The service is always great and the pizza is delicious.  When I order delivery, it takes about 45 min to and hour; however, my food is always hot.  My favorite is their hot wing pizza!  I highly recommend it!! :-)"}
{"text":"1st of all u mess up my pizza's then had the nerve to send your driver to pick up d wrong pizza's while delivery another set of pizza's which one was still wrong. That's unacceptable for the inconvenience caused. Thx much."}
{"text":"About half the time this Barro's will make a really shitty pizza. Call a different location if you can worth the drive to avoid this one."}
{"text":"Its hard to find Gluten Free pizza near our house thats good and affordable - who'd have thunk it was right down the road. This place is suprisingly big and nice, with plenty of TV's for sports games and good sized beer - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They have great wings, cold beer, and amazing pizza.  This is one of my favorite pizza places in the Laveen area.  On weekends the atmosphere is a bit like Chuck E Cheese with brat kids under no control of their parents.  They flail around your dinner table like an unwanted zoo attraction.  Best idea is to order for delivery!"}
{"text":"Great salad. Generous portions. Chicken wings rocked. Clean tables and polite staff. Thank you for a great lunch."}
{"text":"The old standby comes through again. Can't beat pizza and wings on game day. Food was great as usual, staff was friendly, and venue was clean. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"This place just opened two weeks ago and I have already been there twice.  Great pizza, great bread sticks, and a great price.  I am a pizza addict so I have tried a ton of different pizza places in Scottsdale, and Phoenix.  I think this is the best so far.  Great topping selection, great crust, and it all tastes good too!  I got the pizza to go both times, and they have been nice and warm each time.  No complaints.  Will definitely be going there again!  Maybe this weekend!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delish!! We live on Chandler and the 202 and live within 2 and 3 miles of 2 locations and you don't deliver to our address?! Get real. For convenience, we'll order from pizza hut."}
{"text":"My family has gone to this barros for years and we have always received really good service & amazing pizza . Recently a very disgusting incident has changed our minds during family dinner night that won't make us go back ever again. Last week I had a delivery , usually I go in to pick up but because I'm pregnant and also a high risk pregnancy my body didn't make this possible. So I called for a delivery the girl was quick and said 35-45 minutes . Over an hour passed so I called and asked what happened, they repeated my address that was old by 3 years. Usually they repeat the address on the phone with the new workers that isn't the case. They said it would be another 35-45 minutes , take in mind my mom just got off of a 12 hour shift and I'm Prego so We were both starving. They showed up at 10:30 with a cold free pizza and two sides of ranch. I asked where my anti pasta salad was ... It wasn't there, I only got the ranch , neither was the extra ricotta , if I had payed for the pizza I would have payed for a wrong order. The manager let me know they would remake the order the next time I came in with the salad. So the following weekend I came in , the girl at the front was extremely rude to me as soon as I told her my meal had been comped she gave me a dirty look, didn't apologize and said it will be an hour wait. She also told me to make my own salad, I refused and said I had ordered an anti pasta salad the first time, which is not a salad bar salad (if you've had their anti-pasta you know what I'm talking about). I patiently waited , the manager never came out which I thought was odd, As soon as me and my mom got home the order looked fine , extra ricotta , anti pasta salad, seemed like they really corrected things. We opened the box and everyone dug in, my brother had the unfortunate slice , where he found a large PUBIC hair on his pizza. I about gagged and we immediately threw everything away. Most of the workers here are young kids, I've worked in the food industry for many years before becoming pregnant and this is a really disgusting thing to do to someone who has been a customer for years. The employees that work there made me really sick. Instead of actually correcting their mistakes they decided to act like what they are \"children\" and do something so horrible that will never make us go back."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at this Barro's, and tonight our loyalty ends. Called an order in and after the promised 20 mins for pickup I proceeded to pick it up. They took my payment, said it was almost ready. After 50 minutes total I walked out with no pizza. Not only that, the men in the kitchen had obviously not started it. The girls working there couldn't think to ask where the pizza was?!??!! And the manager was so unprofessional. Never offered to make it right and I HAD to ask for my money back. Will never be coming back. You all should consider hiring competent people to run the business."}
{"text":"Have used this barros location in the past (roughly 1 year ago with positive results.  Went back tonight and picked up an order to go for a large pizza and hot wings.  The pizza was pretty good but the wings had almost no sauce. The place looked pretty busy but I won't go back for wings anytime soon"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and wings. The ranch is also very good which is really important to my lady. Fast service with friendly employees. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well they forgot a portion of my order and the driver said he'd bring it back. So I tipped accordingly because he had to make an extra run. Then nobody came so I called to ask if it was being delivered and the response I got was \"we got too busy so we won't be delivering the rest of your already paid for order\" making what I did receive useless and on top of that I was charged for product that I never received. This type of horrible service will cause me to never order Barros again and I've been a customer nearly 25yrs. There are plenty of other local pizza places that are delicious."}
{"text":"Gluten free White pizza, antipasta salad, 12 sweet chili wings, and a couple beers. Good food, simple service, although decor could use some serious work..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my sister and was disappointed to see that they got rid of the salad bar and instead give you a lot of lettuce & croutons, a small amount of tomatoes and grated cheese.   Overall everything was very underwhelming. I also got a slice of veggie pizza which turned out to pretty much be mushroom only, good thing I love mushrooms, oh except they were very thin, not so fresh mushrooms. The service also could have been friendlier for sure."}
{"text":"The best pizza value in phoenix! The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. They have a nice salad bar and the pizza is great! I highly recommend this place. Eat here alone, with a date, or even a party! A++++"}
{"text":"Ordered two slices of pizza, cashier said \"only one left I'll bring the other one to your table\". Fifteen minutes later I went back to the counter. After five minutes I had to call it to her. Claimed my pizza had just come out and cook was slicing it. Five minutes later she literally drops a plate with two slices of personal pizza  on my table and says this is all we have. No apology before hurrying away."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent...not the best but not bad.  Crust was thick and tasted good.  Sauce was a little bland but something (either in the sauce or pepperonis) was quite spicy.  Took about 20 min for our large to come out, although they had several ready if you wanted to order by the slice.  The large was enough for 2 10-year old boys and myself, with one slice \"sampled\" by my husband.  Unique cream soda at the fountain.  The only thing we weren't sure of was whether or not we were supposed to leave a tip.  Overall, a good stop for us."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at barros. We've been coming to this location since I was in elementary school, I still remember when they were at the place around the corner and had a little ball pit!! Haha great times, delicious pizza and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here a few months back and ordered wings, extra crispy. I know. We didn't order them EXACTLY how they are on the menu so shame on us. The times we've come here even before this, the wings just never tasted done enough, and we like them extra crispy anyway. If we're paying for something, asking to just leave it on a little longer shouldn't be that hard. We got them and they were barely cooked enough. Called manager when we got home and they gave us a free order next time. We ordered again, still not quite what we want but they tried to fix to do right by us so we were grateful. Come this Valentines day we decide to order again, it's been a few months, maybe it'll be better. Got a pizza (Pizza was absolutely amazing) and ordered the wings extra crispy again and yet again, they were barely even cooked enough. Sad and disappointed that this keeps happening..."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh pizza also the garlic wings are amazing I will definitely return back and try some different things on the menu"}
{"text":"My sister and I called to place an order for delivery around 12:30 pm. We called at 1:30 to check up on our order and they said the driver had left. I called back at 2pm because our food wasn't delivered yet, the employee said the driver went back to the ire store he didn't have our gate code. That supposedly he called me and left 3 messages. He never called or left messages. My food was finally delivered at 2:30 pm, 2 hours after I ordered it. It was cold and soggy. Bad customer service and bad delivery."}
{"text":"Today I had the opportunity to taste Barro's pizza at a training I attended. I am giving them 4 stars because:  1) They were on time and food was hot 2) The pizza's all looked consistent 3) The ingredients were fresh 4) good flavor 5) Filling!   The crust was too thick for me, I like a thin crust. I also liked the flavor of the white pizza; however I wish they would spread around the ricotta instead of placing a great big bob in the middle of the pie.  I found the pizza good; although I would probably choose another place if given the opportunity, primarily because of my personal preference for the crust."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We order the pizza an hour later we call to check on it they said its on its way to call back if the delivery person doesn't get here in 10 mins. We call back 20 minutes later still no pizza. They said the delivery man knocked and no one answered. We have a doorbell and didn't hear any knocking. They argued with us when we called back and finally sent a new pizza over. This happened 2 times. I'll never order from them again."}
{"text":"I'm used to eating Pizza in Italy and the New York market, but when I tried the pizza at Barro's in Anthem last night it was fabulous. The thin crust was exactly as it needed to be. We ordered half Vegetarian and half Barro's special - well divided with no crossover and superb taste. Speedy service and pleasant staff. The atmosphere is a little too casual - meaning it was like a fast food joint. Not sure what target market they are trying to attract, but the Anthem market is a little more upscale. I'd like to see a whole wheat thin crust since I rarely eat white bread but I'm very happy with the experience and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We've gotten pizza here many times by now, and we continue to be impressed.  The food is excellent, the employees have always been very nice.  Never gotten an order wrong, and typically the food is done on time, or early.  My father is not big on pizza but went back for seconds, and thirds when we took him here. . .  And naturally we had to bring friends here when they came in from Ca--it got rave reviews from them, too!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great pizza! Had a move-in coupon and the Manager came out and introduced himself. The pretty girl behind the counter was very nice and welcoming.   I highly recommend this place for great pizza and friendly service.   GREAT JOB, BARRO'S PIZZA ON MCDOWELL!"}
{"text":"I love Barros, their pizza is always delivered pipping hot never cold. Every time I call for a delivery their staff is always very courteous and cheerful. The only thing that kept me from giving them 5 stars is that the past 2 times I've ordered they didnt get it right. The first I orfred crispy wings, I got hard dry wings no sauce and they forgot my drinks. I had 2 two liters of sprite and I only got one. Now today's order my wings were not crispy but a soggy mess, and they forgot my sprite again. Ugh what's up Barros you never failed before I'll continue to order but might order my wings from a different place all together."}
{"text":"Barro's is fast-food pizza.  Step up to the counter, order a slice or two, maybe some wings, and you're good for lunch.  It's cheap, delicious, and fills you up.  The staff are always friendly, and seating has never been a problem."}
{"text":"Been eating here for a few years now and doesn't get old! Love this place it's great food. Their lunch specials are filling, cheap and delicious! Beats major chain pizza any day.   Plus their TVs usually have sport on :) - I always get the number 3."}
{"text":"Yucky! I'm confused why most of the reviews are so good. $20 bucks for an xl pizza and I think that the frozen pizza at the grocery store tastes better. Your average fast food place is nicer inside. We tried pepperoni and one with chicken it's probably cafeteria quality. Salad bar was also cafeteria quality at best. I tried Rosati's next door and it was far better for the price."}
{"text":"Took an hour and forty-five minutes to deliver pizza when I was told hour and 15min. I called at an hour and half spoke with the manager Jerry who was kind of rude and could have cared less , .so I that point I didn't want the pizza. Personally I won't be patronizing them anymore but that's up to you. Very inefficient management"}
{"text":"This is a busy place on Friday nights! Always very good food and fast friendly service. I would have given them 5 stars, however, the gal working there grabbed the wrong gluten free pizza and gave that one to me after repeating my order to confirm. I didn't check the pizza before leaving (I trusted it was correct when she read the order back to me correctly).   Got home with it and it was Ham and Pineapple (which my husband greatly dislikes). We ordered Ham, Sausage, Mushroom and Onion. Luckily he filled up on the Antipasta Salad we ordered along with the pizza.   Note to self: lift up pizza box lid and confirm order.  The food is very good here and Friday nights are really busy for good reason!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza. Great food and awesome service! They made one of our pizzas wrong ( 1 topping). So they gave it to us for free and made the pizza right."}
{"text":"Highly Recommend the BBQ chicken! It's... like heaven... on pizza. Great service and great delivery. Pizza always comes in hot and tasty. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Cave Creek is not Chicago, hell it's not Phoenix.  But we were watching Sunday night football and all of A sudden my neighbor and I decided that grilling salmon was too much effort.  And our BAC prohibited driving    We have few choices in town for delivery, one of which is Papa Johns which I find hideous.  Not just here but everywhere.   I am originally from Portland so I got the awful papa johns experience there as well.  Pizza arrived 20 minutes earlier than promised.  It was very good.  My neighbor ate 3/4 of it I saved one slice for breakfast.  If you are here in cave creek it is a great option.   Unless you want the take and bake from papa MURPHYs   But again, sometimes discretion is the better part of valor when you have no designated drivers among the hungry neighbors watching sports   The best daytime pizza ( no delivery) is at The Hideaway Bar and grill up in town   Hands down.   So I've obviously had more awesome pizza in foodie Portland, Chicago and NYC.  But this is Cave Creek. So a man needs to choose from where he lives  My one criticism is that they don't deliver after 5pm.  Which I find to be a stupid business decision, but really, who wants pizza after 5pm except everyone   They have a bizarre explanation but it is what it is   Give it a try but if you have a pizza craving after 5 and don't feel driving past the MCSO gauntlet you are screwed. So good pizza but order early."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE.  It started when we first walked through the door.  The cashier just scowled and gave an unfriendly glare.  We were first timer's at Barro's ordering carryout so we needed a second to look at the menu.  It seems we were judged for some reason on appearance or our ethnic origin.  I'm an Hispanic male in my 40's, served in the USMC for 15 years and my daughter is white complected and dyes her hair blue (a different color every month!), oh and she is about to complete her Bachelor's Degree next semester and start on her  Masters.  So my daughter is getting judged on her blue hair while the cashier/waitress have more piercings then a circus sideshow act?????  Or it could be I'm Hispanic...who knows? We certainly didn't judge the rude staff with tattoo's and multiple ear and face piercings. They should learn to do the same.  On the way out we were even met with rude stares through the kitchen by none other then our rude cashier and staff.    Now for the good.  The pizza is decent.  It isn't independent new york style good, but it is better then most of the popular pizza chains.  The garlic bread sticks were a hit and the spaghetti and meatballs were surprisingly good.   Bottom line, there are just to many eating establishments in the area to waste time on one that has a disgruntled working staff and all around bad service."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place, but our pizza tonight sucked big time - the crust was bordering on inedible ( Barro's Special, original crust).  We used to get our pizzas from this store until the Goodyear store opened; never had a problem before.  If tonight were the first time we'd gone to Barro's, it would be the last time.  Never again at this location - Goodyear or nothing."}
{"text":"We order delivery, they always deliver wrong pizza, we ordered pizza tonight so bad!, old like been sitting there, we waited an hour and a half, really disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummmm! I've been dining at this location for awhile now, and tonight's pizza was so exceptional that I called the store to tell them how good it was!"}
{"text":"I had been traveling since about 2am the day we decided to give Barros a shot. We chose a meat lovers (whatever the official name for that is) and a cheese pizza for the kids. We ordered at 3 pm for the pizza to be delivered at 6 pm. I was exhausted by this point and looking forward to the pizza. Once the pizza arrived just before 7 pm I was both hangry and exhausted so admittedly I was in a bad mood but was just relieved to finally get the pizza. To my dismay, when I opened the boxes the order was completely wrong. Frustrated, my wife called to tell them they got the order wrong. Since she is nice they kept putting her on hold and answering again like she had just called in and she had to repeat herself multiple times. After hearing it happen about the third time I decided to take over the call. After refusing to go on hold again (yes, it happened again when they answered the phone from being on hold) the manager was very apologetic and felt bad about the mistake. He offered to refund our money and credit us a pizza for our next order to give us a reason to try it again.  Well, we finally decided to try again yesterday. When my wife called the manager on duty talked to her as if she were stupid and tried to imply we were trying to get free pizza (who does that???). Long story short, we had Dominos last night and the second chance was wasted by a \"manager\" who didn't understand the value of customer service. To even imply that we would take the time to call them and try to con them out of a free pizza is absolutely insulting. I value my integrity greatly and for her to think I would sell my integrity for a free pizza is alarming.  Try at your own risk, I hope your experience is better than ours. But, could it get worse?"}
{"text":"Watched a dog pee on the floor beside my table inside the restaurant. The whole place wreaed of cigarette as the patrons smokiing were right outside the door violating Arizona non smoking law. Talked to manager he gave me a dirty look and cleaned up the dog pee by my table next to the salad bar. Called corporate received a call back from manager telling me to come back and he would treat us right. Came back and asked to speak to the manager he told me \"that's nice\" and walked off.   Don't bother coming here. Management is poor, and I will be filing complaint with az health dept."}
{"text":"The pizza is phenomenal! Love the flavor and texture. Nice clean restaurant. Good prices and fast delivery. We end up ordering from here at least once a month. Pass it up if you want but you will be the one missing out, idiot."}
{"text":"The service there sucks. They rushed us to order and didn't give us a chance to look over the menu. So we ordered a small pizza and some wings. The wings came out first and they were undercooked. Then the pizza came out. Pizza was delicious but the wings ruined my appetite. Will not go back to that restaurant."}
{"text":"saw the review's on yelp and decided to try while here for indians spring training.  Good pizza and honey bbq wings were great.  I would recommend"}
{"text":"Giving this location a 5.....for the best pizza around,  but the service, I'd have to say was marginal.  For some reason our 3 pizza order was just too much for the gal at the counter. Other staff must have noticed, since, by the time we were done, she had another team member standing behind her watching,  not helping, but watching......just a little frustrating. ...."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal we always get delivery sometimes we go there for Boy Scout meetings really great atmosphere even though place is a little it still looks amazing."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good pricing on pizza and salad. Staff in friendly and informative. This is my go to place on pizza day. They have gluten free pizza if you're a celiac (I am not, I get to eat that tasty gluten) they also are corn free (my wife is allergic to corn)"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Barro's before and had good expereince. Ordered wings (extra crispy) and Barros special pizza.  Showed up 45 minutes.  Pizza was not cooked through and hubby had to put wings on the grill -I don't like it when I pay top dollar to eat out and they can't get it right.."}
{"text":"We always take out. Most often we'll call ahead and pick up, but sometimes we'll just drop in, order, and wait while they make it. The quality is consistent. You may want to ask for your pizza well-done, because sometimes the crust is a little doughy in the middle.  The staff is friendly. A lot of teens seem to work there. Glad to see teens in the labor force."}
{"text":"I no longer have the receipt, I am not wanting anything in return but wanted you to know it wasn't great and to work on the service."}
{"text":"Best pizza in all of AZ! My family has been eating here for over twenty years now. There's literally no other place we order pizza. Their wings are good too, try the spicy-BBQ... SO GOOD! And my husband swears by dipping pizza in their ranch"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. The whole family loves this place. Be prepared to wait if calling for delivery, much much faster to call your order in and pick it up."}
{"text":"I have never got a bad slice of pizza here in the past 20 years I can remember eating it.  Great lunch special.  Food is always a treat.  Thanks Barros!"}
{"text":"I wish the delivery guys would stop using my neighborhood like a race track."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I waited 30 mins for chicken wings. Would not recommend this barros at all!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually complain but I'm beyond irritated right now. We order from the signal butte location often and we love the food and have never had a problem. I have family in town and I am injured so Tonight my sister ordered 2 pizzas and wings and breadsticks. 1 of our 5 children has a food allergy so we made sure to order breadsticks specifically for them. However our breadsticks didn't come and while 4 kids are eating the other had to wait for us to cook her something. We finally got a moment to call and let them know and because of how incredibly rude the manager Billy was we didn't want our account credited because we won't be ordering again so we simply asked for a credit back to my sisters credit card only for the breadsticks and the $2.50 delivery fee. Billy said no he wasn't going to give the credit because we waited 2 hours to call. Well it wasn't 2 hours it was less then an hour and we had to get 5 small kids situated. Our order was nearly $60 and they messed it up and then said we didn't call them fast enough when our priority was feeding our children. I am incredibly disgusted at the customer service. By the way I have a pic that shows the time it was 15 min after I spoke with billy and it shows the time I ordered and our pizza was delivered an hour after we ordered it which is typical and I am not complaining about the delivery time. I just wanted to show proof that it wasn't 2 hours after we had our food like he tried say as for his justification in not refunding less then $10!!! Terrible way to treat customers especially ones who have been ordering from this location for several years! Billys poor attitude shows incredible disregard to loyal customers as well as to the Barros franchise."}
{"text":"What happened? Ever since the move it's been downhill. 1 girl working the register., and 1 cook in back. They have a line out the door, but severly understaffed to handle it. The pizza is still good, but good luck finding a clean table to eat it on."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, but ever since they moved the service sucks. Been here  numerous times and they never enough people working to provide good service.... C'mon Barros you're bigger and busier now, fix this."}
{"text":"This place is always so dirty and grimy, been there twice and will not be back.  Customer service is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ! Love this place and always have great service! The Barros Special is a combo pizza that is our go to and my favorite pizza. The have a few specials with wings and a large pizza. There wings are delicious!"}
{"text":"Gone downhill... pizza still good but wings are poor at best.  Very disappointing for the Sunday night game.  Lucky the pizza was good...  I'm  giving up om the food stuff close too home..."}
{"text":"In one word, this place is horrible. We ordered breadsticks with pizza sauce and a large cheeses pizza to go. True to what other posters said, the staff is rude. They acted las though I was interrupting their evening by ordering dinner. When we got he food home, the pizza looked pretty good. The breadsticks were dry and crunchy and the pizza sauce they served with them was ice cold. The pizza was gross. The cheese was super salty and was thick and chewy, even though it was still hot. Even worse. As I was eating my slice I noticed a hair in the slice! The hair was definitely not mine. We threw our food away and went and got dinner somewhere else. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I just love this place, people are great, even the boss comes out and talks to everyone and clears tables. Great team work here. Pizza and beer... How much better does it get?"}
{"text":"Great for lunch but not so much on delivery.  a few weeks ago, my wife and I had a few friends over and I had ordered a couple pizzas for delivery so that they would be here by the time everyone had arrived.  They said it would be like 45 minutes.  I was cool, until the 1 hour mark came around.  My pizza finally got to my door at 1 hour and 15 minutes and the kid looked like he was about 12 delivering my pizza.  I felt like I had to make sure he didn't eat any of it on the way over.   My recommendation, go in for the pizza, don't get it delivered."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery.  Two X-large pizzas, a sandwich and boneless wings.  The food arrived hot and fresh.  Pizza is very good. We ordered the Hot Wing pizza and pepperoni with extra cheese.  Cheese was oooey gooey which is exactly what we were craving. Roast beef sandwich was hot and was very tasty. Wings a little over sauced but still a good tasty appetizer.  Overall good value for the money."}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this place.  I have to admit I've only had the pizza, so I can't comment on the wings or pasta.  We like to go for lunch and get the specials...where you buy it by the slice.  We can feed all 4 of us for under $20, just can't beat that!  I love their sauce and the crust is always great."}
{"text":"When you are on a quick lunch break and need some good food with a nice place to eat... this is the place!! The lunch special is awesome! Their slices and a drink cost less than $5!! I come here almost twice a week and love their supreme and pepperoni pizza. It tends to get very busy and noisy on Wednesdays because the local kids have early release so I avoid that day. Grab some co-workers and enjoy lunch together!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. This new location is better to visit for dine in than their last two baseline Rd locations. Great service. Usually quick even when a large group invades.  Always loved their wings.  Their salads aren't bad either. While I'm a fan of their standard pie, many in my family are addicted to their white pizza. I always try to use their coupons when getting delivery.  Barros doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"WOWZERS! this is the best pizza ive had in Phoenix. Or maybe even the USA (including NYC) - a very unique blend of cheese that packs a really good flavor, just the right amount of sauce on a perfectly seasoned crust! ive had the original and thin crust, cant decide which is better...usually thin crust wins on the ground of the whole 'less carbs' thing.  lets also talk about the breadsticks. oh, those breadsticks. you really get a HUGE order of breadsticks, and they sure are delicious. its almost like ordering a whole pie, minus the sauce and cheese. again, perfectly seasoned and baked.  the price cant be matched - two people (one who REALLY loves pizza) can be completely full by only spending $10. hard to find that kind of value these days.    its also near an awesome record store. pizza + good music = life doesnt get better"}
{"text":"Just had horrible pizza somewhere else and was reminded how much I love and appreciate my ole standard Barro's! Thank you for providing great pizza to me since I first ate it in high school in 1990! Get the side of ranch for dip. Only pizza I use with ranch and it's the best. Never been disappointed. Love. Me. Some. Barro's,"}
{"text":"Decent, but definitely better near by. Very soggy and greasy for the pizza, decent salad bar. Not very cheap comparatively either, might recommend Don's on 75th and peoria or Ray's on 59th and greenway instead."}
{"text":"First off i order from here often.  This time around they didnt have the soda i wanted.  The delivery drive stipped at circle k and picked uo the sida for me.  Now thats customer service right there!!!"}
{"text":"A good place for kids. There is a play area. The pizza was not very bland/generic. If you want good pizza this is not the place."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Barros! Great pizza and the ranch is to die for! Do your self a favor and get extra ranch so that you can experience it for your self! The crust is so delicious with ranch, the pizza itself is not in need of ranch but it adds another level of satisfaction! I do carry out all the time and with a large and extra ranch it's still under 20! So don't forget to tip your servers and counter staff!"}
{"text":"It is been a couple months since we have been here and I remember why not sure how this place doesn't frustrate more people every time we order food including this last time it is 20 minutes past the promise time staff is rude and the quality of the food is sloppy"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Barro's for years and have always loved the sauce and crust. you can still get pizza by the slice between 10:30 and 4:00 its a great stop if you dont have a lot of time for lunch. The crew is friendly and very motivated so make sure you leave them  a good tip !  bring the team they can push the tables together"}
{"text":"We just love their pizza and wings. The Pizza is just delicious. We always get the breaded wings with honey hot sauce. It's the closest thing we could find to Country Sweet wings in Rochester, NY."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza and wings I can ever remember having. Once we took our first bite we ate like starving children. So good! Hot wings were perfect. Still eating but had to write the review! Had a pepperoni sausage and garlic pizza... Heavenly!"}
{"text":"I love Barro's pizza but have had to many disappointments at this location. We decided to order from here today. Our pizza was 20 minutes late, our pizza was not hot when it arrived and the delivery driver was completely rude. Definitely time to find a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Good food. Gluten free pizza is one of my wife's favorite. Wings are pretty darn good as well."}
{"text":"I don't crave wings, I rarely eat them but these had to be the best wings i've ever tasted. Pizza took long but it was amazing and delicious worth the price."}
{"text":"I go to lunch here once a week, the pizza isn't going to blow your mind, it's just good.  One strange thing about their pizza is that right of the oven its not very good, and it's a bad 'morning after' slice. After sitting 15 minutes it's at it's best."}
{"text":"Many of my friends dig Barro's Pizza and come here for a weekly lunch as a tradition. So I decided to tag along today to see what the fuss was all about and quite frankly, I'm not that impressed.  The hot wing pizza I had was overly greasy and rich. It became the undoing of my stomach lining, causing peptic ulcers left, right, anterior posterior, superior and inferior. There was no end in sight. Like Mordor, my innards became a barren wasteland devoid of life and happiness.  As the poison passed through my body, it erupted from me like the fiery lava of Mt. Doom. The contents that spilled out scorched me like a whip from within. Such pains and labors I had to endure until I was rid of this heavy burden. Even my friends that took me here no longer seem like themselves to me. I can trust them no longer. \"Share the load,\" they keep telling me. But I know that this is my talisman to carry and nobody else's...  My time on the porcelain throne was a hardship I would not wish upon my greatest nemesis. The sight of a grown man crying is one of the most difficult to swallow. Gandalf's words kept ringing in my ears, \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\" Indeed, I feared that this pizza would never pass and would become my burden to bear for all time. To grow inside me like a tumor and become a part of me. But thankfully, it eventually did pass and the tower of Sauron fell and we have peacetime now! =)  As for my rating of Barro's, nay. You shall not pass. You fail. Though I give you props for doing what few have done to my body. My immune and digestive systems are among the most proficient and powerful in all the land and you've bested both. Let Barro's name be heard and feared as one that will forever live in infamy."}
{"text":"I ordered a Barro's special pizza which was good. Crust was light and lovely. Unfortunately, I ate all of it before my boyfriend's spaghetti arrived 45 minutes later. We had to ask two different girls behind the counter for an ETA on his food before someone brought it out. He ended up boxing up his food to eat at home. Overall, the food tasted good but they have a few kinks to work out with service. We'll be back because there aren't that many places to eat nearby. Everyone in the 85297 you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Pizza was solid, above average for the price.  2 adults and 3 kids ate for $30.00 so it seemed like a great value. The service was outstanding. The kids where being difficult on what to order and she was very patient and friendly in what I'm sure was a difficult situation. Overall a quality place I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Slow counter staff, then our pizza gets sent to another table! They gave us a credit for our next visit. Lame!"}
{"text":"Barro's is a pretty good option to consider when you're too lazy to make something, as long as it's close to you. It's quick, relatively cheap and tastes good. We go with a large pizza, a small antipasto salad (love this!) and garlic bread...all for under $20. Lasts us a few meals and hits the spot. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been eating here for 10+ years. It's simple... good pizza and great customer service!"}
{"text":"The word \"awful\" does not describe the dried out mess we left on our dishes we just dumped in the trash as we rushed out and could not leave fast enough, surprised we were not sick in the parking lot."}
{"text":"We had a free pizza coupon so we figured it's worth a try. The place is clean, the pizza met expectations, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty bad customer service. Pizza was cold & girl at the front did not offer to warm it up"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here a couple times and the workers that have taken my order are nice and the delivery guys. Pizza is good but kind of varies, I wouldn't recommend thin crust, gets a little soggy maybe cuz it's delivery but their boneless wings are delicious and drowned with sauce every time. Honey hot is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have ever had ! Hands down ! Before this place I could take or leave pizza, not now ! You gotta try !"}
{"text":"This place has very good pizza I think that it is the best pizza that I have ever had I would highly recommend this place and I love the set up"}
{"text":"Barros is nothing like it use to be . I Remember back in 2002 when I first tried them there was so much cheese and topping they would fall off when trying to eat a slice and there salad bar was always fresh with ice cold dressing .   Now it's two pieces of pep per slice and  very lite cheese.  There salad bar is disgusting new product dumped on old and  not very cold . You have pay for the watered down dressing in a cup if you want more than one."}
{"text":"Great food in the past,  but my last visit my 3 hot sandwiches were cold and soggy from sitting on the counter for 20 minutes.  Someone forgot to write on the board I had paid and was waiting."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying the phone service and delivery service was great. They where super nice. We go to other locations of Barros all the time however this experience was horrible. We ordered our pizza and cheese sticks and it got to our house before expected. We ordered a little late but they made it sound like it was no big deal. It was about 45 min to an hour later my boyfriend and I started getting lethargic and dizzy. We where both hunched over with cramps and nausea. It felt like we where intentionally poisened. We almost ended up in the hospital. This was the only thing we both ate that night. We loved Barros, however this location ruined this for us. I don't know of the kitchen is dirty, or somone poisoned us becuase of the time we ordered. This location made us sick."}
{"text":"If there was a no star option I would put it!! Came in when it was completely empty and ordered a simple pizza and wings. They brought our wings out quickly and 45 MINUTES later we wondered where our pizza was. Since it was empty we were trying to be nice and give them a chance. Went to go ask what the hold up was and was told the order was never put through. WHAT? The manager didn't even come up to apologize, just a waitress. Offered free dessert. Uhm, no. I asked for my money back. Took another 15 minutes to get my cash and then no one even mentioned if our pizza was coming or not. Had to get up AGAIN and ask if we even had food coming. Another 15 minutes later we weren't even hungry but got our pizza. No apology from management, no apology whatsoever from anyone. Pretty sure manager was hiding in the back. Absolutely ridiculous service, and this hasn't been the first time. Will be warning about this location and taking my business elsewhere! Get your act together!!"}
{"text":"We were in town for Spring Training and gave Barro's a whirl. It claims to have chicago style pizza but I was born and raised there. Chicago style thin crust never has topping on top of the cheese. And it's never pie slices, always square. If you forget their claim it's decent pizza. I like the chewy crust. We ordered the special with wings and it was a good value. Lots of food. The wings were far better than expected - lightly breaded and meaty. The hot actually had some heat so that was an added bonus."}
{"text":"My favorite!!  I have been eating Barro's pizza for almost 25 years now at the various locations.  Lunch special prices are unbeatable and the pizza is the best! The Mega Meat is fantastic.  The staff is friendly and the management team treats me like family.    Wish they would put pepperocinni's back on the salad bar!"}
{"text":"Love Barros pizza but the customer service from this location was terrible. I've been in the restaurant industry for years and never have I felt an \"unwanted\" vibe. I ordered one of the lunch specials 2 orders #4 pizza, side salad, and a drink for $4.74 (good value) + 12 traditional hot wings... when i finished my small salad I felt like having some more salad and when i was putting some salad onto my plate the waiter/cashier tells me \"the salads are only one time your going to have to pay $3.75 for that salad\" my reaction was well I'm going to put the salad back! But instead of arguing to the reasons I was not going to pay I just paid the $3.75 for the small salad.   It was my mistake for nothing asking I figure but shouldn't they have some sort of sign indicating \"don't be a fat ass\" only one serving on the salads - thanks management."}
{"text":"I am Italian and I am a pizza snob. I was born and raised in Wisconsin where a lot of italian places take great pride in the pizza making process, we moved down to Goodyear 3 years ago. I LOVE Barro's pizza.  Service is great. Delivery usually is 45 min to a hour but whatever.  You will not be disappointed. A family of 5 can eat under $36."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever eaten!! We dine in one night a week for the fresh hot pizza right out of the oven. No pizza taste the best from the box, we think."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, as you read this review that it isn't so much the issue, but how it is handled...or not handled in this case.   This was communicated to Barro's on April 4, 2012 and as of today, April 10th I have not spoke to anyone regarding this situation.  I understand that mistakes happen but again, it's how the mistake is addressed that can make or break a customer.  Surprise, AZ Location Order 5730  I just tried calling twice and was hung up once when trying to be put on hold and was on hold for over 5 minutes the second time.  That probably lends to my frustration at this point.  I called in an order at 6:20pm and was told 20-25 minutes and I showed up at 6:45 and was told my pizza wasn't ready.  After waiting TWENTY FIVE minutes I went up to the girl and asked her to check on my order.  After running around, she found it in the warmer and it had been sitting there the entire time!!  She said she was sorry but the order was under Linda Miller, not Melinda Miller.  Really??  At what point do you look at the order and realize it's the SAME person?  We actually stopped going to Barro's last summer due to issues just like this and this was some kind of welcome back.  We live around the corner and I'm pretty sure you'd agree, I shouldn't have to heat up a luke warm pizza, I paid for a hot pizza.  Hopefully you can use this feedback and get your act together."}
{"text":"Nice family place. Pizza is good and I like to sit and play catch up with my kids :)"}
{"text":"On a typical visit you can expect an above average experience. When I say a typical visit I mean a quick stop into this mid level service pizza parlor for a pizza, bread sticks and a beer. The furniture and tables appear to be dated but that is a part of the charm. Orders are placed at the counter and then delivered to the table by a friendly sever. As previous reviews have noted, the staff is very attentive to the condition of the dining room.   I typically order a thin crust cheese pizza with a side of cheese bread sticks. I order my pizza with light sauce because in my opinion the default amount is too much, ordering this way garners a pie that is somewhat similar to a New York style pie. The bread sticks are great and flavorful. The dough for the bread sticks is fluffy and and textured. The prices are very competitive and the main draw for me. Outside of a busy Friday or near a holiday you can expect an above average experience at barros.   The reason for 3 stars is due to the customer experience when the place is busy. Before I continue it is important to note that any restaurant that is busy needs to be credited for it. Obviously they attract high volume for a reason, right? It appears that the staff becomes very overwhelmed and frustrated when experiencing high volume for pick ups and deliveries. One night I ordered a pizza and mozzarella sticks and went to pick up the order 40 min later. When I showed up my pizza had just come out of the oven. They placed it in the heater when I waited an additional 20 min for the mozzarella sticks. Other customers also experienced this issue. Their ovens were cranking out pizzas but their fryer station was unable to keep up."}
{"text":"Their pizza is delicious and the prices are doable. I did notice that they like to burn their pizza a little bit on the crust. I like my pizza cooked but not that cooked. I need to take it out of the oven little bit earlier.The service is good when you eat in. Delivery normally takes 45 minutes to an hour."}
{"text":"Only been to one other Barro's where service and pizza were great.  First time going to this location. Never waited so long for a pizza in my life.  Ordered takeout over the phone. Simple order: pepperoni pizza and wings. 25-30 minute wait. I give a buffer and show up 40 minutes later. Told I have 5 more minutes by the cashier. Wait 15, check again with same cashier, then told my pizza will be next one out.  Wait an additional 15-30 minutes and see 10+ pizzas go out (takeout or order-in patrons). Check again. The cashier that initially took my money notices me still waiting but stops making eye contact - doesn't begin to have initiative to follow through with the kitchen. Get some lame excuse from manager that delivery driver took my pizza (because that was the \"ONLY\" pepperoni made that night, I'm sure). He at least offers a partial refund. I ask if the wings will be hot still and staff say \"oh yes we pack it up tight\".   Finally get pizza after waiting an hour in the restaurant and head on my way. Open up wings... totally cold! Oi vey...   Overall wait time: one hour, forty minutes  First and last visit to this location.  (The guy next to me waited an hour for his pizza - ordered it to-go from the register, too)"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed right now. I called in my order and the girl on the phone was very unhelpful and very confused and messed up my order multiple times on the phone. She didn't seem to understand the specials and charged me wrong. I come in to find my pizza and wings aren't even ready 30 minutes later. This Barros needs to train their staff correctly and please don't train your employees and help customers at the same time- it doesn't work."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! They have the best lunch special a slice of pizza, salad and soda. Great price and great food. Staff very nice and the restaurant very clean. Can't wait to go back. Delivery service also great and speedy service and have used that many times."}
{"text":"To whoever was working the night shift on May 16, you guys are awesome.  My girlfriend and myself ordered a pizza for delivery at about 8 o'clock and waited til about 9:30 before we decided to call back and check on our order.  Apparantly the order has been placed under pick-up, no big deal mistakes happen.  So they decided to make us a new pizza, and send it out to us for free on top of giving us the other pizza that we had originally ordered.  Great service guys, will definitely make you our main pizza joint from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pepperoni and Italian sausage for take out yesterday for the first time. Heard all the ravings and had to try it out. Overall not bad I enjoyed it but wow I was so surprised how greasy it was hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings by far....been eating hear for years thought it was time to write a rewiew"}
{"text":"I work down the street and sometimes go there for their lunch deals. The best pizza for lunch always hot and fresh and the price for 3 slices and a drink is not bad. The problem I have is when you go there on your lunch if there is ever a table open you practically have to clean it yourself. I see dirty dishes everywhere and customers bussing their own tables. It's really not that hard to have your crew go through the restaurant every 10-15 mins and clean the tables. I don't like sitting at  a table with left over pizza crumbs and cheese all over the place. The fact maybe you don't have enough staff at lunch I don't know but every time I have gone in there it's the same thing. I hope the Barro's management sees this because i really like the food but hate to have to clean my own table just to sit down."}
{"text":"Hello,   My name is Jeff Wieland. I am the service director at Audi North Scottsdale. I used to be next door at BMW as well, for a combined 10 years of time here at the complex.   In the last several years, I have used you guys for everything I needed , personal, or for business. The food has always been outstanding.  There was however a short time where the service didn't represent the Barros name very well.   I wanted to let you know that those days are over. Your store is hands down the best ran, most friendly , helpful and delicious Barros pizza in the valley. I exclusively use you for all of our corporate orders. One of the reason  I believe for the positive swing is Mitch. He has been a life saver. When I forget to order until the last minute and he makes it happen, or knowing my order before i mention it, are just a few of the reasons he is a true assert to your business.   Thanks again for you time."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery from this location yesterday.  The guy on the phone was friendly and efficient - he gave me a discount, which was nice(but didn't specify how much or for what).  The delivery was on time, maybe even a little early, and the guy was personable. I thought the cheese pizza was just ok, but everyone who had the veggie pizza had great things to say about it (I'm of the school of thought that veggies belong in salads, not on pizza, but to each his own).   I've had better pizza, but the folks were friendly and if I was in the area, I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"My mouth waters when I think about Barros. I've eaten pizza all over the world. This is as good a pizza as you can find. The dough is chewy and thick, which is the way I like it. I order it with extra sauce. I'll put this up against any pizza place in the valley. It's not Giordano's but it's up there."}
{"text":"Pizza ok.  Hole in the wall pizza place.  Nothing special. Customer service is less than what you would expect from a local pizza place.  Ordered for delivery.  Received wrong pizza, brought it to their attention and the person wanted to argue about it.  Please try and tell me what I ordered; especially when I have never ordered a pizza with those toppings.  They have enough customers so no need to keep this one.   Char and streets of New York are in the area and provide competitive options."}
{"text":"Every  time I order wings here, they come out skimpy broken bones . Never equal drums to wing pieces.  I just had one drum out of 6. Sorry can't order here anymore. Very disappointing based on other baskets I've seen come out.. wings simple,  guess not."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Barros pizza again after a year of eatting Grimaldis pizza. I love Barros pizza sause, and that is the only reason why I give them a 2 star rating. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza with extra sause and mushrooms on half. I drove all the way home and opened the pizza only to see that it was not my pizza. I called and was put on hold so the manager could be found. The manager came on the line and told me that she would remake the pizza. Once I got the new pizza only to see it was my original pizza. It was cold and soggy. I will not go back to barros again. Its worth it to me to pay extra for Grimaldis. At least I know my pizza will new fresh and I never receive the wrong pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Best in anthem but not the greatest ever.  The place could use an upgrade to enhance the atmosphere.  The lunch specials are great."}
{"text":"To see the number of five star reviews for this shithole really surprises me.  \"Dining in\" = pure crap, unorganized, filthy, and a compete madhouse.  \"Kid friendly\" = obviously means a place where a person can let their feral kids run around screaming like a McDonald's playland.  \"Manager\" = the guy who stands around flirting with the insipid wait staff.  \"Side dish\" = anything that is not pizza, prepare yourself to wait an hour for a meatball sub sandwich.  I'd rather pound my dick flat with a mallet than go back to this festering pile of feces."}
{"text":"Not good  service the manage .Not knowledge.There were service late delivery I will not recommend it to anybody the lack of knowledge of the people running the place is absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been coming to this restaurant for the past five years and have noticed recently a major decline in customer service. Cashiers are young and rude and not informative about changes in the menu. We came in for dinner and noticed while paying that the bill was substantially higher than normal, even after ordering from  a set price off the menu, when we questioned the cashier she rudely responded there was a surcharge of $3.00 for traditional wings over boneless. There is no sign indicating a charge on the menu or the counter, there was no warning by the cashier either. I also checked the receipt and there was no separate charge but it was included in total (picture attached). It would of been nice to have the option to pay extra or not, bad service."}
{"text":"We had our school night there last night. It was packed, people seemed happy, and as always, their pizza was very good! Barro's is always generous to our school and I appreciate them very much."}
{"text":"The pizza used to be good, but the last 2 times not so much. The pizza was soggy and greasy, even the salad had \"chunks\" of lettuce heart. We actually ordered Papa Johns last time we wanted pizza, it was good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Every time I go in there the staff is pleasant the food is good and there is always a good game on. It would be cool if they had a full bar but hey can't complain. It nice because the kids can run around and it truly is like a pizza parlor. Get some video games and it takes me back to the old days.   Salad bar is always good, pizza is amazing.   The only advice would to maybe not charge for extra ranch and make the salad bar unlimited. Just a few suggestions.   Keep up the great job"}
{"text":"Great pizza nice crust not greasy and tasted amazing.  Will stop by again when ever in town."}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley. Kona pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"Staff is incompetent, service slow and food was bland and cold. Upon request to have salad and apps served before the meal it was not done. Will not be back. I have never written a review before but my experience here was just so disappointing I had to do one."}
{"text":"Good pizza! A little more expensive than Papa John's or Dominoes, but you get what you pay for and these guys are pretty fucking good."}
{"text":"We had it delivered, came pretty fast. Husband says best pizza we have tried here. I really enjoyed the wings."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good prices. But there are so many flies in the restaurant it's almost unbearable. Next time I will take it to go for sure.  Would be 4 stars if not for the gross pest problem."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but my pizza from last night sucked. It was soaked in grease!  This will be my last pizza from this location. Will try to find another location that will deliver to my apartment."}
{"text":"Probably some of the very best Pizza in town!  If you want great tasting Pizza and you want it pretty fast, then come to Barrio's!  They make outstanding Pizza in either a regular or thin crust and the toppings are well supplied.  Multiple size choices to choose from along with wings if you want those as well.  This may be a \"chain type\" store, but this isn't your run of the mill pizza.  You will not be disappointed...give Barrio's a try, they are worth it!  Lieutenant Colonel T Flynn, US Army, Retired"}
{"text":"Nice location.    Very bright, which is nice.   Pizza is good as always from Barros.   Their chairs make me chuckle... looks like they bought them from a Greek restaurant that went out of business... they have that awesome Greek Isles Blue color going on!  Bathrooms are average.  Clean and normal industrial bathroom soap smell, nothin' funky."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Stopped in for lunch today and got their pizza by the slice.  Now usually when you go to a pizza place and get the pizza by the slice it is dry and has that \"been sitting under a heat lamp for 4 hours\" taste.  This pizza did not.  It was just the right temp, the pepperoni was perfectly crispy (a huge plus for me) and there was an awesome amount of cheese compared to sauce (not big on sauce in general, so I am always happy to find a place that doesn't drown the pie in sauce).  Grabbed some ranch for the crust.. The ranch was a great consistency and had nice season to it.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Amazing buffalo chicken pizza! Restaurant could be a lot cleaner though! Sometimes salad bar isn't stocked fully but it's a great lunch special!"}
{"text":"We order from Barros about 2-3 times a month. It's our normal \"Date night in.\" We swing by and put our order in or call in and shop at Zia until it is ready.   We have never had a negative experience or have them screw up our order. (I'm hoping not to jinx our experience tonight haha!) We always order the large one topping pizza + 24 wings, its a great deal!   The only reason they aren't receiving a 5-star review is because they won't change my name in their system no matter how many times I request they do so! It's Breanne, NOT LeeAnn!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah!  This place is legit!  Ordered a two topping LG with a dozen wings for 22 bucks.  Their hand tossed crust game is strong; fluffy and soft but good outside crunch. Sauce is sweet and zesty.  Sausage has good fennely flavor.  I was so pleasantly surprised by how much cheese was on the thing!  Most places are pretty skimpy with that stuff, it being the most expensive food item they have.  I am a connoisseur of pizza and wings my friends, so trust what Im telling you.  They are neck and neck with Nellos (pizza-wise) as far as flavor but surpass them pricewise.  I will NEVER order Domino's, pizza hut or papa john's again.  Their wings are pretty good.  They could use a brining, but they are cooked very well (fried of course) and the skin comes out taut and crisp.  None of that soggy fatty ball skin textured shit that you can't eat and have to throw away even though it is potentially the best part of the wing!  *note: always order your wing sauce on the side to retain maximum crispness.  Bravo!  It's so hard not to eat the other half of the pizza right now!"}
{"text":"Ordered a XL pizza and 24 boneless wings for delivery after waiting over an hour, the pizza was cold along with the wings.  I also believe they delivered a large pizza, as what we got was nothing more then that.  $39.00 later yup never going or ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Barro's is our favorite pizza for family night and we love their generous and meaty boneless wings."}
{"text":"Ordered for a large staff meeting and it was delivered on time and hot. Can't go wrong with Barro's Pizza, but this location is extra clean and large enough to have a big party if needed. My experiences have always been positive, and food is great, as always. No wi-fi is the only negative."}
{"text":"I oredered a large pepperoni pizza and 24 wings. They had a special; 1 lg pizza and 24 wings 26.99. The pizza and wings arrived appx 25-30 min later than they told me it would be. my food was cold and incomplete; only 12 out of my 24 wings arrived."}
{"text":"Have to say that my jaw is still dropped. To start I ordered two large pizzas with 24 boneless and 24 traditional bone-in. We were delivered 48 boneless. I called and the manager and was told new wings were on the way. Upon delivery 30 minutes later, the driver asked for incorrect wings BACK!   Hope they were not seriously trying to recover their losses. Lost a repeat customer tonight."}
{"text":"This place is consistent and I like it.  The young chick who took our order last time was here again, and there was that glimpse of \"hey, I remember you guys\" in her service, as she seemed to have our order in the computer before we finished our sentences.  She was efficient and amused by our random banter.  Definitely winner of all the Barro's I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Yummy Barro's goodness as always.    Great Barro's price (check out online for more discounts)  Staff has personality, always a plus."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me, knows I have a sad love affair with Barro's Pizza....  However, there was just something not quite the same here.  The people were very nice. The place was ok, a little odd (even for Barro's standards).    But there was something that just wasn't quite Barro's-ey enough for me.  The crust wasn't totally what I was used to, the cheese a little bit different, and it was all just a bit haphazard.    I'll probably be back because it is on the way to-and-fro. But something just wasn't on par.  Maybe it was just an off day......"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the valley. Most of the time I get just a personal extra cheese and extra pepperoni. It is a great deal at around 8 bux. Lots of cheese and sauce has the perfect amount of spice . Staff is really good and upbeat -- they seem to enjoy there job even though they are cranking out the pizzas and busy. It seems like the inside could be remodeled to have better and more TV screens for sports and some tap beer. It would be a perfect location for the company to model a bit more of an upscale, sports bar style sit in area as I think the demographics would support this."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good for groups.  Haven't had the pizza yet."}
{"text":"I used to love ordering Barro's when I was in town. Now every time there is an issue with the order. Manager calls it will be late but we are redoing your order. Ok good thank you. But I doubt that happened. The ranch for the wings was hotter than the wings. Last time I order from them."}
{"text":"I love this Place every time I visit Arizona I always make my friends and my Dad take me here. Best Pizza I have ever had in AZ . I highly recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"this place is super good! we've had it 3 times since moving here to Arizona in August. we've ordered their pizza, breadsticks with cheese (highly recommend), and a sandwich; all in which were definitely satisfying to the tastebuds! although, delivery is ALWAYS an hour. that's the only reason for the 4 star rating. overall, i definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza. Good inexpensive lunch specials. Thursday's meat trio slices of bacon, ham and pepperoni are delicious! The wings are good too!"}
{"text":"I come into barros for lunch a few times a month and its always great.  The staff is great.   Pizza great.   Good price"}
{"text":"We love going there for a affordable family dinner.  Good food, good prices.  The bad - a couple of time we have got take and our orders were wrong:( so must check! and always busy which is good for them but hard to get a table and it gets very loud. Overall good pizza n wings and we go there repeatedly."}
{"text":"Barros has the best pizza every.   Alexis is a nice young lady and the Branden Manager was very helpful.   I actually had a problem with another Barros and called this store. I thought it was the last one I ordered from it was not.   Alexis and Brandon still took care of the situation. Not to many people have customer service these days or even knows what it means however this store does!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My hat goes off to both of you."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Try the chicken wings... They rival some of the best in the valley!  Multiple TV's with sports playing."}
{"text":"First time at this location. However, not a newbie to Barro's. I had my first time a few months ago at the Barro's in AJ, near my boyfriend's dad's house. We went there because I was craving wings and my boyfriend suggested it. They serve freshly made pizzas, pastas, and wings. They have this promotion where you can get 24 wings and either a Large or Extra Large One topping pizza for either $26 or $28 depending on the pizza. We got that deal and it is so much food for the two of us BUT it is beyond delicious. After my first visit, I had dreams and cravings to go back. It's that good.  For the wings, we normally get a dozen Honey BBQ and a dozen medium because you can mix and match. For the pizza, we get the pepperoni; can't go wrong with that. They have won awards for their pizza and the restaurant. We once sat down and ate and I overheard these bikers, who sat next to us, came from across the nation and found this Barro's on YELP and said to the workers \"It's the Best Pizza in Arizona\".  To me, it's really good. I am sure there are great pizzas and wings elsewhere but this place needed to be mentioned. Will be back VERY SOON!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Only thing I would change is if you order wings or breadsticks they should come out first and not all together with your pizza."}
{"text":"While walking to my car with my pizza (mushrooms, olives, and onions), I suddenly realized that my clothes were getting wet.   I stopped walking, tipped the pizza box, and saw liquid pouring out of it onto the ground.   I went back into the restaurant, and someone took the pizza back into the kitchen.  After about a minute, a manager-type came out of the kitchen, opened the register, and started counting out some bills.   I thought: \"What a classy place!  Since my clothes might have been ruined and the pizza now must obviously be subpar, he's refunding my money.\"   Wrong.   He was evidently just making change from the register.   Then the person who had taken the box back to the kitchen came out and handed me a boxed pizza with no explanation.   I looked at her questioningly.   She said the liquid was because of the veggies that I had ordered.   In other words, it was my fault.  We've ordered plenty of mushroom-olive-onion pizzas before, from other places and from the old Barro's, but never before have we had any amount of liquid coming out -- let alone a large amount, as in this case.   And now the pizza was in a new, un-warmed box, so it was going to be cold.     I had forgotten to order the pizza with a thin crust.   When I opened the box at home, I found that the cuts in the thick pizza dough did not go all the way through.   So in addition to having a poor, cold, dry pizza, we now had to struggle with our pizza cutter as well.  My clothes were machine-washable, but it would have been very bad if I had had a big food-liquid spill all over my car.     This experience was a poor one, and I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Called in my order to avoid wait times. Was quoted 15 minutes to be given cold chicken wings and a warm pizza that wasn't even cut all the way through the bread FORTY minutes later. Forty!!! Also, they didn't put the cap all the way on the ranch so that didn't end well.   Also, when I told the woman at the front counter I had been waiting almost triple my wait time she said \"yeah I noticed that.\" ..... and you didn't try and solve the problem? Weird. These people need to get it together. Waste of $20"}
{"text":"Ordered on line live less than 3 miles from store. Took themmwell over an hour and two phone calls to get my pizza for the little ones. When it finally arrived pizza wasn't hot. All I got was excuses as to why they didn't properly staff for Valentine's Day and the rain of course delayed the drivers. Sorry Barros your pizza isn't that great that i won't go to other stores to get mine in the future."}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza that I've ever put in my mouth. I'd eat this pizza everyday if I loved closer. Cinnamon breadsticks are delicious too"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The dinningroom was clean and comfortable. The only reason why I didn't give these guys 5 stars is because service could have been better. Not that it was bad...it was just nothing more than a transaction. Overall I was pleased."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get a quick lunch. Their pizza is great. I always get one of their lunch specials when I go there. They're a great deal!  My only qualm is that they have difficulty keeping the salad bar stocked at lunch time. Not really a huge deal, but a girl's gotta have cucumbers on her salad, ya know?"}
{"text":"Best Pizza Around.  I love their veggie and my husband loves the Barro's special.  The cheese bread is sensational.  The only thing I hate is if I get it delivered it always takes an hour.  Never 45 minutes its a full hour.  I've only had one time when the pizza wasn't hot when it arrived and I called and they gave me 25% off my next order which was sufficient for me.  The amount of toppings is perfect.  Not too many so the pizza falls apart when you eat it.  The crust is perfectly chewy and the ranch dressing is great for the cheese sticks to dip into.  My 16 month old loves it and my 8 year old (who is the pickiest kid on the planet) is always asking to eat here.  Always will choose Barro's when going for pizza"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat , I love their pizza. This is one of those places where you can't stop eating the slice because they are so good ! The pizza is a little on the greasy side , however that's what brings the pizza alive!"}
{"text":"It's the best pizza I had good price it's a good price when ur alone thank you Gabe Mesa AZ"}
{"text":"Went here the other day, chicken wings are amazing!!! Very clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The worst service and food I have had in a very long time at a Barro's  The salad was frozen, the pepperoni pizza slice had 2 pepperonis, my slice of sausage had 2 small rounds of sausage. The crust was burnt on the bottom, and was gross.   The people working were clueless and unwilling to help. We waited 20 mins for them to get another slice of pizza for the slices. There were only 3 people in the restaurant. It was 12pm  Stay away from this place unless you want a test of patience and shitty food and service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time nor appetite at this branch. Food was horrible and not as described by the cashier. Manager could care less."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food, service and management. We ordered pizza, wings, salad and drinks. Both the pizza and wings were not good, they were very dry and tasteless. We told a waitress who took the wings and poured cold sauce over them and brought them back to the table without even mixing them up. Both tasted so bad we couldn't even eat them. The only good thing was the salad. When I called and talked to the manager a few days later he asked if I had told anyone about the issues and I said yes we had. He then proceeded to say that we should have spoken to a manager about it not the waitress. Isn't that part of their job? He told us to come on in and give them another try sometime. That will not be happening! Way to expensive for something that tastes so bad and waitresses that do not care."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Here visiting from  California and stumbled on this little gem. This is the best pizza I've had in a long time. This place is now my #1 pick for pizza when I come to AZ. Awesome guys keep it up."}
{"text":"Pizza is real good. Staff seems somewhat disorganized and it's difficult to find a clean table even though there are only two booths full at the moment"}
{"text":"Two people, two small pizzas & two beers.  And here I thought we were an \"easy\" table...  My pizza was brought to our table after a short, but reasonable wait.  My dining pal's?  NEVER CAME.  After waiting 15 minutes longer (and my pizza getting pathetically cold), he went to the counter and asked here the grub was.  Unapologetically, we were told the \"ticket got lost\" and that a new one would be out in 5 minutes.  For it to be \"lost\", it sure is curious how the cashier knew exactly what he had ordered.  Ugh... so finally the second pizza came out, again without any apologies or concessions.  By this time, my pizza was straight-up cold.  Boo.  If your order doesn't fall into the abyss, you can expect delicious, heavily-topped (like I like it) pizza in a very clean, but familiy-friendly setting.  They serve beer and wine by the bottle and individual-serving wine bottle, respectively.  I haven't tried them out for lunch, but the deals are smokin' - I think less than $3 for a slice + a soda."}
{"text":"Tried their location off Tatum a couple of weeks ago and it was good.  Tried this one last weekend and I like this one even more.  Great customer service and really friendly staff.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town, fresh salad and the wings are very good always very good service. I'm ordering now."}
{"text":"We grab pizza from here at least 1-2x a month so I owe them a review. In the takeout/delivery pizza world there are the big names (Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa John's) and then there are the smaller guys like Barros. We like Barros because it's consistently solid.  We've ordered delivery and takeout and never been disappointed. Their pizza has a great crust, is not greasy, and the ingredients are always fresh. We also typically get wings from them too and those are great. A point I think worth making is around their staff. Friendly kids that work hard in a fast paced environment, impressive."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but I've been holding out on this review for a while in hopes that my gradual decline of my experience were just a series of one offs. I will preface the review with this...I pretty much only order the buffalo chicken pizza because it is/was my favorite.  First they stopped sending ranch to me with my hot wing pizza. Sounds petty to complain about, but are you ever charged extra for ranch when you order wings? Didn't think so. I'm not a poor man by any means but to me, its not the price, its the principle. Now I ha.ve to specifically order ranch. I am now charged .50 for a side of ranch. sigh.  Next they started skimping on the buffalo wing sauce. I mean it was just bread and cheese with a dabble of the hot wing sauce on it. Its not a hot wing pizza without hot wing sauce. So now I have to start ordering the pizza with a little extra sauce. No biggy, maybe I'm picky?  Maybe I'm the jackass customer here... because I have to specifically order extra things on the pizza. Again, price is of no concern, just make make me a good pie and I'll happily enjoy it.  I have a feeling I'm now known as the peice of shit sauce guy I order the pizza as usual but now I have to add in a little extra buffalo sauce, and a side of ranch (with no hint they were lackluster the last times).   I get this monstrosity delivered to me with so much damn sauce on it, I feel like it was done out of spite. Hell, half the pizza slid off the damn crust, which was also kinda half way between regular crust and thing crust.  \"Oh, you want a well done steak? I'll give you a well done steak...\"  The only reason I'm giving this one more star on top of the minimum requirement is because the young guy who delivered the pizza got here damn fast and was a nice guy, also the gal taking my order on the phone was nice too. I'm not here to give a positive parenting review so I feel like the extra star should go to them and not this place, whatever, Barro's gets brownie points for hiring good delivery & cashier people. /rant  http://imgur.com/a/ET6LU"}
{"text":"When I arrived I asked for the #4 as usual which is the 2 slices and a drink, I always get pepperoni. This time they only had one slice and said more would be out in a minute do you want the one now and the other when it comes out? I said no I'd prefer they both be the same quality of freshness... Low and behold when I got my plate the first slice burned my mouth and was perfect and the second slick was like warm....... Not happy at all"}
{"text":"Walked in to order a pizza. What I wanted was very simple. A pizza pie and extra mozzarella cheese on the side so when I go home, I can put cold cheese on top of the warm pie. In NY, it's called cold cheese pizza. I was looked at like I was crazy and the manager said they don't do that because I'd be leaving with their product uncooked. I've been to many pizzerias in AZ, and never encountered this before. If I'm paying for the item, what I do with it after is none of your concern. Waiting in the pizzeria right now to try it for the first time, let's see how it goes. So far something very simple became very complex."}
{"text":"Pizza was a little blah from how it used to be back in the day.    This place was crowded but the servers were friendly.  Got two slices to go and it could have been better.  I was on a time crunch.   Next time I'm in Arizona, I'll make it a point to dine in and hopefully the pizza will be more fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Barros. Barros. Barros. You hungry yet? You better be if you're ordering from here. This is very thick pizza. Lots of bread. Totally worth the money, a cheap and delicious way to get stuffed. I love bread too so I like this style pizza. Good sauce, huge portions, lots and lots of cheese, and fresh toppings. They have really great ranch dressing too...I usually get a few sides for pizza dippers. They have yummy garlic cheese bread too and it's only $1.50 an order!"}
{"text":"I normally would give this location 5 stars but after the poor service I received last week, I can no longer give them my business. I ordered a pizza for pick up, as I've done so many times before. But this time, the pizza was not up to it's normal high standards. The pineapple chunks were too big and the sauce and crust tasted 'off'. The ingredients were just not fresh. I could taste the chemicals. It tasted cheap! This use to be the best pizza ever, but not that night!  The following day I called them up and asked to speak to a manager. I got Matt on the phone and I don't know where he learned to be a manager, but after trying to see if they changed suppliers, he was so dismissive in his response. I felt completely brushed off by his tone. He kept saying he'd look into it but they haven't changed suppliers in the past 12 months. But something was not right and I really didn't get the feeling he really cared. I explained to him about their usual high standards and how often we order from them, but I really didn't feel he appreciated that. So, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. I do not want another un-tasty experience. I don't give my business to those that don't appreciate it. Way to go, Matt!! You just lost a very good customer!!"}
{"text":"Well I went back for a second time because the food was great. My girl friend and I love the cheese bread and pizza.  And believe it or not they have some of the best ranch. No I'm not a picky person but I do appreciate good ranch, not that hidden valley stuff. So they have good food and great ranch.   But that's it.  My complaint is not with the staff, they are relatively friendly, and young. Both of which aren't bad things. They have no guidance.   Management is terrible!  The place is filthy, always understaffed, and filthy. It was Friday night, the floor hadn't been swept, the tables around us were not bussed, and the soda area was disgusting. I would say 10 tables didn't have anybody sitting at them when we walked in, and 8 of them were dirty. I had to wipe my own table because I didn't want to next to the kid section.   Management here's some advise. Always over schedule, and make cuts. Your restaurant is in a great location. And it is Friday night. If your place was cleaner than your business would thrive. You might get regulars.   If I was you I would hire four teenage boys to just bus tables and sweep floors. Nothing else.   That or actually ride your staff and push them harder. I wouldn't allow their armpits on the kitchen window either.   Stop leaning."}
{"text":"So much for \"crispy thin crust\" pizza! Gross!!! Last time I'm ordering from Barro's, this happened last time too."}
{"text":"Good pizza, wings, salads and I highly recommend the blue moon draft."}
{"text":"Good pizza nice staff will be back also chicken wing we're great The reason I'm giving four stars is that bathrooms were filthy"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a reviewer but I know customer service when I see one. The service in this location was truly an amazing experience especially when it was our first time eating Barro's Pizza. Kaitlyn (not sure if I spelled the name correctly) served us with an amazing smile despite of how busy she was. The Pizza was great and it was hot and fresh.Tim the manager did a great job by making sure we and along with everyone else was happy with everything. Tim and Kaitlyn trully helped Barro's earn a new customer. Thank You for the Great Service!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza joint with family friendly prices. Not gourmet pizzas! Just classic pizza joint! They have cleaned up the Greenway Road location! Some long days demand a simple family pizza night! Barro's does it right. Love to support the local guys too!"}
{"text":"Well I stopped in with myself and my 2 kids to eat lunch on the lunch special.we needed a total of 4 slices of pepperoni pizza ,they only had 3 said 10 min for more. I dont understand why u wouldn't you wouldn't start a pizza when u realize u at that low. Also the 3 slices we got we're not even room temperature. very very poor on their part"}
{"text":"Stop in here at leat twice a month. Service is awesome salad bar is always fresh and the pizza rocks :)"}
{"text":"Pizza is hard to rate depending on how you like it. They over thin crust and reg. we got the reg and it was decent. Sauce is sweeter than normal. Pizza has a soft doughy texture . Toppings are good quality."}
{"text":"I LOVE BARROS. The best pizza hands down, I loved it so much the first time I visited AZ I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on in the pizza world! I have Barros every time I come to AZ now, it is tradition. Everything from the sauce and toppings to loving the crust, truly perfection!"}
{"text":"A 10!!!!!   u can't go wrong.. thin crust Barros special with no bellpeppers add pineapple & bacon   if u never been here.. they take care of any issues .. no questions!!  there sandwiches are also very good with lots of meat., I recommend hot!!"}
{"text":"Delivery is quick and fast. The drivers are always pleasant and friendly.  The wait time is short on the phone.  We order the mega meat, salad and breadsticks with cheese...this loacatuon has THE best crust and sauce to cheese ratio.  When my sister and cousin come from the west valley they order from THIS barros coz they say my barros us better than theirs.  We have also had wings and subs delivered at other times and it was also great!"}
{"text":"I love the taste of this pizza.  The problem is, I keep asking for THIN dough pizza and I rarely get thin pizza!  Why can't they listen to their customers?  I know they can do this, as I have had thin pizza there, but RARELY do they listem to their customers!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Barros since the late 1980's and I have to say it is the best everyday pizza in the valley. Always our go-to and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"Best chain delivery pizza in Arizona. Period. The delivery is always delicious. Try any of the specialty pizzas. They are miles ahead of any competition. Even the sides here are incredible. And if you're picky about fountain soda, that's great too. Friendly staff, good food, what's not to love? This is definitively the gold standard of Arizona pizza. 10/10 delivery and eat-in as well."}
{"text":"Went here last night for daughters birthday. Ample seating for Saturday night. Cashiers were friendly every time we needed something. We're willing to warm up some remaining pizza for us due to late arrivals. Four stars is for manager telling us to get our limes from salad bar instead of serving them with our beer. Sorry to bother you dude. All in all was a good experience."}
{"text":"This is ok pizza. We are from NY so we are very picky. The sauce is tasty, its nice and greasy, the cheese is good. The crust is pretty bland but I can live with that. The employees and delivery guys are always incredibly friendly and helpful.  Our only complaint was the hot wings. They had no flavor. We ended up throwing them out because they were just not good. Also the XL pizza is really small. I think its only 16 inches. XL to me is 18 or more..."}
{"text":"We love their pizza, especially the gluten free pizza as it doesn't taste GF!  The kids area in the back is a plus for when our kids need to move around during dinner, but, why does it always smell so musty???  I don't know what's up with that, but I truly hope they figure it out and clean, fix, or update whatever in the building is causing that smell in the back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing...But this is the SECOND TIME an employee has swept the floors around us literally flinging dirt in the air towards our food. First time I thought it was someone new and inexperienced but COME ON!!! Food service 101 people! We'll just have to take our food to go from now on..."}
{"text":"So excited to have a good sit-down option in Laveen where I can take my kids and have a nice, family dinner.  We've been two times since it opened, including opening night.  I've been pleased with the quality of service and the food each time.  I've always liked Barro's Pizza, and I'm glad there's a local option now instead of just national chains.  I was also beyond pleased at their prices.  We'll definitely enjoy having this Barro's so close!"}
{"text":"Take Away:  Decent pizza and wings if you are in a pinch for pick-me-up.  Ambience good to catch a game/beer/dine in  We ordered some take out pizza and wings from Barro's and went in to pick it up.  Walking into the restaurant I was shocked how nice the interior looked/the number of TVs they had.  It seemed like a solid play to catch a game.  And the 4-5 beers they have on tap doesn't hurt either.    The actually pizza we got was a veggie and it not too bad--plenty of vegetables but I personally thought it was overcheesed (assuming that's a verb).  We got hot wings as well and they seemed better than your Little Ceasers variety but probably not as great as your true wing titans aka they probably will get the job done for wingnut."}
{"text":"They are hit or miss. When they hit it's really great pizza. But I must add the price for wings is ridiculous as \"Native\" plus not very good. If you want great wings go to \"Doc n Eddy's\" $8.99 for a dozen and you can have them grilled."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time since moving to Chandler. Pizza was very good and the service was great. Quality ingredients, cooked to perfection. We will be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered the thin crust and it was terrible - soggy and greasy. There were several booths available but all were dirty while the staff milled about talking amongst themselves completely oblivious to the customers. Not a fan, and will NOT go back."}
{"text":"It's much better to order delivery or takeout than eat-in this location for sure! It's usually not cleaned up even around the tiny salad bar. Tables sticky and bathrooms really in need of attention. They have good pizza and some of the pastas are OK but usually a little greasy. Do not even bother with their gluten-free pizza. If the one I got is indicative of what they consistently produce as GF then they just need to take it off of the menu. Cardboard crust with slimey mozzarella, watery sauce and it was hardly cooked.  I am GF so I've tried enough to know this isn't even close to what GF pizza is supposed to taste or look like. Even raw, it took nearly an hour to bring it to the table! In fact, the other 8 people in my group had already eaten at that point! It was the only time in my life I've ever asked for my money back. Ever! The people at the front aren't very professional either on the phone or when you go there. As a result, we only order from Barros in a pinch."}
{"text":"We get takeout pizza there all the time and it is by far the best pizza I've ever had. I usually hate leftover pizza but I love their pizza left over."}
{"text":"The bbq pizza is to die for, and that's from someone who doesn't like bbq chicken. When ordering the cheese bread you have to get the garlic butter sauce. It's not on most of their menus you will find online. But they always have it!"}
{"text":"Love barros, especially this location. We order weekly from them, today I messed up my online order fully expecting to pay again for the correct pizza to be delivered a second time. Phone operator talked to the manager and he kindly sent the pizza that I meant to order free of charge, my kids and I thank you!"}
{"text":"We love their Pizza. We tried the wings last night and were very happy with the barbeque ones. We stuck with traditional style instead of boneless. My only negative is they give you one serving of ranch or blue cheese per dozen ordered. That's not enough and they charge for additional. I don't expect an unreasonable amount but two would be more reasonable.  Overall great food and prices."}
{"text":"Wow huge place! Lots of TVs, lots of seating & a high ceiling! Super fresh food even at 1pm on a Tuesday. Pizza made when ordered, boneless wings tasty & juicy.   $30 for large pizza, 24 boneless wings & 2 unlimited refill drinks. Way more than enough for 2 people, we'll be eating this for days... Also, has drink & slice for $3, drink & 2 slices for $6 - great deals for lunch time.   Staff friendly. Fast service. I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"This was our second time ordering from Barros.. First time was wings and pasta which was cooked to perfection.. This time around we decided on pizza..which we are very picky about.. However this pizza was superb! The sauce was amazing an abundance of toppings and super cheesy..we often order thin crust but went with the traditional crust and it did not disappoint.. It was baked perfectly and very flavorful. We will definitely be ordering our pizzas from Barros for now on!!"}
{"text":"Its possible I may vomit tonight. I just ate a slice of Barro pizza and it was HORRIBLE. I then ate a few disgusting wings and waaa laaa I want to puke.   So listen up. You want the worst pizza on earth followed with the wings made probably from bats? Order here.  I warned you so if you die your family can say that you were just an ignorant fool to eat here.   Try the hawaiian pizza. It gets delivered ice cold and soggy to the point you think its stuffing."}
{"text":"Barro's, this is my 2nd time eating here and I thought it was decent enough to yelp it.  My go to pizza spots in the area are Isa's on 40th, Spinato's, and once in a while Rosita's.  So I was having some friends over the fight, I didn't to spent a fortunate on those pizza places, so I went with Barros.  I ordered couple of pies and a lot of wings and they turned out pretty good.  The pizza was pretty greasy and you could see it just sitting right on top of the pepperoni! The wings were really good.  We ordered hot, mild, and BBQ.  The hot isn't very hot.  Overall not bad for the prices you pay.  I would say its a better than Domino's, Papa Johns, or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Customer service is fantastic and the pizza is delicious! Love their ranch. Boneless wing are always a hit."}
{"text":"Used to order from here a lot! Then, the pizzas started getting delivered soggy and drowning in grease. Finally decided to give them another try, so I ordered thin crust, hoping to avoid the sogginess. Totally disappointed.  Sog City.           They're also really inconsistent with their wings. Sometimes they're drenched in sauce, and sometimes bone dry. Not worth $40 for pizza and wings, delivery and tip. I'm done."}
{"text":"Okay I'm a regular here and like the food and will be back, however the service tonight was intentionally poor. I wanted their special which is an Xtra large pizza & 24 wings for $28. I asked if I could make it half pepperoni & half sausage since it was only a 1 topping special. She said that would be an additional $1.75, okay I said, but the price was about $5 more. She said that she could take a couple dollars off. The pizza wasn't ready in 20 minutes, but 35 minutes and when I got home, no sausage, only pepperoni. I thought about going back, but it was late and I was tired. In the end I paid a couple extra dollars more than the special and no extra toppings."}
{"text":"I work in Scottsdale near this location.  I may be one of their oldest and most consistent customers; for good reason. I've placed a few hundred orders since they opened, mostly pickup, but some dine-in's and deliveries.  I often pick up pizza for a small team that I work with. however, I rarely go elsewhere as this is everyone's favorite.  Why?    1) Customer service. They have mostly young people running the counters, but they are obviously trained well. I am impatient and I expect a certain level of service and professionalism wherever I go.  These folks consistently provide kind, courteous and polite service.  Sure they make the off the mistake, but it's rare, and besides, don't we all? 2) Speed.  Phone orders are easy and they typically complete taking my pickup orders in less than a minute.  When I go to pick up, I get through the line within 5 mins, even when it's long.        3) Taste. It's just great tasting pizza!  Perfect blend of flavors and perfect crust.  I often get a Veggie and add Pepperoni and Sausage... great pie!   4) Consistency.  I've been to 6+ different Barro's.  They are all great at the above, however, this one is ridiculously consistent.  They've never made a mistake on my order, and I don;t remember ever getting a bad pie.    5)  Price.  I picked up a small pepperoni yesterday; it cost $8.10 and fed 2 people.  Last weekend I got a large pie for my family... $13.50 with tax!  I ordered 4 large pies for a team meeting... total was less than $50.  Bottom line, Barro's is the best pie for my money!    Customer for Life, John G."}
{"text":"Staff is great and definitely set up for kids to be entertained.  The wings are great.  The pizza isn't bad, but isn't spectacular which is why I didn't give more stars.  The thin crust is much better, the thicker crust tends to be a lot of bread and little toppings.  Not the Chicago style that I'm used to.  Beer is nice and cold and a decent selection."}
{"text":"Service terrible waited 15 mins to have a beer poured.  Since they have a food server not a waitress I asked for something she just gave attitude like it wasn't her job, and couldnt believe I asked her for anything.    They make you pay up front with a tip line on the bottom,  god i wish i could take my tip back.  The only good part was the pizza but the overall craptatuclar service made me give it a one.  I may order again when they have delivery service available."}
{"text":"Lunch is easy here. The pizza slices are good sized and very quick. The pizza is excellent and service is fair. It's a large Barro's and there is always plenty of seating. Parking isn't great but it's not terrible. The only downside is... kind of a musty smell. It's not awful. It's not grab your lunch and run out of there bad, but I've been in lots of Barro's restaurants and countless pizza places in general and none of them have this smell. It needs to be looked into."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this barros twice in the last month. Each time specifically requesting my pizza be there at 1210 because my lunch is at 12 and it takes me 10 minutes to get home. Both times the pizza showed up 25 minutes earlier then it was supposed to. So I had a cold pizza by the time I got home both times. Spoke to a manager on the phone and he didn't seem to care at all continued to tell me how I was wrong. I would highly recommend going to a different location. I will never be coming back. Would be 0 stars if I could. Why would they even let me pick a time if it didn't matter ?"}
{"text":"I ordered, 24 medium wings and one personal meat lovers pizza.  Delivery was spot on and arrived in 39 minutes, despite they always say 45 minutes to an hour. (Yes, I time these things)  The delivery boy was professional and super sweet friendly.  The food?  TO DIE FOR.....Wings were juicy, perfectly spiced, the pizza?  Crisp, buttery crust, fresh toppings and everything was piping hot.  Do it people......these folks deliver what they say.  Very happy tonight after many bad experiences with other places. Totally changed me!"}
{"text":"Cant never go wrong with barrows pizza, that thick crust pizza cover in so much cheese it's to die for as a cheese lover Lol!! Chicken wings could use a dry rub"}
{"text":"We love Barros! It's our only delivery pizza we'll do! Thicker, Chicago style pizza. Love their honey hot wings too"}
{"text":"Barro's is quite good, but I think its weird how this is supposed to be Chicago style pizza. It's not like any pizza from Chicago that I have had. In any case it is still good food. I also like ordering the wings with my fiance."}
{"text":"So great. Even though it is a little too greasy it is a good place to head after a soccer game or anything. I personally think it is a nice place."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service. Have had to take my pizza back 3 times already. they do not know how to take orders right, and when you go back, they don't care about their errors on their end. Manager here clearly could care less about customers. I was a regular here, but will never be coming back. Absolutely terrible experience here. go up the street. there are better places that value their customers more. it is one thing to make multiple mistakes on orders. it happens. but when you do not own them and burn your customers, you will lose business."}
{"text":"One person ahead of me, that had finished their  order and no other customers. No acknowledgement when I came in the door. Waited while this customer just talked on about two minutes. I left."}
{"text":"Gluten-free pizza was gross and cold. Will not be eating there again. Go to Grimaldi's! It's worth the price!!"}
{"text":"We've called ahead to pick up at this Cactus Rd. location for many years, but we'll find another location from now on. The last several times have ended with the same results: call up, place the order and we're told it will be ready in 20 minutes. Show up 20 minutes later and sit there in their lobby for over 40 minutes, so the pizza is actually taking over an hour."}
{"text":"Just to let you know, with the heat that comes with summer don't expect to get water from Barros pizza. I went to pick up a pizza and asked for a cup of ice water. Shockingly I was not given one. But it's ok because for $1.89 you can buy a cup of ice water. Well let me tell you I can go to Circle K and buy big bottles of water and ice for less. They do have foam cups but apparently when they are out they get in trouble for offering other alternatives. My biggest problem with the situation is the girl working there wasn't very nice to me as well as her co worker, who does offer alternatives. Maybe next time if you have a problem with another associate take it to the back and not in front of customers. All this hassle for a cup of ice water. Great customer service."}
{"text":"My family and I love Barros. Their pan pizza is really good - I especially like the pepperoni). They're generous with toppings and the crust is really good (I recommend dipping it in their ranch dressing). The garlic cheese bread is also very good, although it's better in the restaurant as it doesn't travel very well. You can't beat the price either!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Barros on Lake Pleasant Parkway for 3-1/2 years. Since about September of 2014 it has been hit or miss. Bad customer service, errors with orders, pizza quality has gone down and the employees are loud and obnoxious in the dining area. We have given them chance after chance, but the last time we ate there, it took almost 20 minutes for a manager to correct an order problem, and then it never really got solved. Location is so great for us, but unfortunately these loyal patrons are going to have to move on."}
{"text":"Barro's is hands down my favorite - the best pizza I've had since moving to AZ a few years ago.  We usually go to the Tempe Barro's out of habit since it's right down the street from where we used to live but a few weeks ago decided to try this location.  The atmosphere here is way better! Not to knock the Tempe Barro's but this one just seems more relaxed, cleaner and much newer. The bartender/ counter guy who took our order was funny, friendly and seemed to enjoy his job a lot.  The pizza was perfect and service was fast.  We'll definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Best service with the best employees. i was talking to some of the guys that work there the other day jared and ryan and there really cool guys. Quality guys. And they got my food out to me really quick. Cant wait to come back. also theres this awesome chick that works there. I think its caitlin. Shes chill af. Jk jareds a bum"}
{"text":"So it's been years since we've had a Barros pizza, even though I see it every time I pull off the 10. So I decided to grab a pizza to go on National Pizza Day. It was great and substantial! Four topping large and out the door under $18. This is far less than the local pizza place we patronize in our neighborhood, and tastier. This will be our go to joint! We even did a taste comparison to our usual place and hands down Barros wins."}
{"text":"Always love Barro's but this is my first time to this location. On top of the great food, excellent service, and sports bar atmosphere without the bar, they have a kids play section. It is a wonderful bonus as my two year old and watch cartons, play with other kids, and play with the play kitchen. Makes it nice to help keep the little one occupied while waiting for food."}
{"text":"Gotta love Barro's!!  Used to load my car up with as many people as possible and drive over to Barro's for lunch...much better than High School food!  To this day (over 15 years) the pizza is *STILL* excellent!!!"}
{"text":"From out of town looking for a place to grab lunch with my husband. Saw this place had decent reviews on here so I thought we should try it out.   The restaurant itself was clean and cool (temperature) with only a few people eating when we got there, about 1 pm on a Saturday.   Prestin and I both got a #2 lunch special (2 pieces if pizza and a drink) but I could have gotten one piece, they were big and thick. We spent just over 10$ each getting a side of ranch for $.50 a piece.   The reason I gave this place -2 stars is because the pizza tasted old (both pepperoni and Hawaiian), it was obviously handmade (what we looking for) but it had been sitting in the warmer for at least a couple hours. The cheese was congealed and not melty and had hardened strings where other pieces had been taken out of the pie. The edge of my pepperoni was hard and crusty, like it had been sitting out and gotten stale.  The pizza crust itself was tasty but heavy, more like a baguette texture.   I'm sure this pizza would have been great if it was fresh, unfortunately we didn't get to taste it that way."}
{"text":"the girl at the front with dark hair and glasses was super rude for no reason and y'all should fire her. horrible customer service and barely said anything and everything she did say was short and rude . bad face for your company . shake my head"}
{"text":"This is one of the best examples of what cheap corporate pizza is. Pre made crust disks topped with cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"Went back on another day and the service had returned.  Food was good and hot.  Talked to the manager about my last visit and the manager heard my concerns and thank me for giving them another try."}
{"text":"My go to pizza in Phoenix.  Consistently good regardless of day of week or location. Ready when promised and there are so many locations that you are always close to one"}
{"text":"I'd say I'm a fan. I always order the Kona pizza because it's the closest I can get to ordering a Hawaiian pizza. The Teriyaki sauce is really what pulls the entire pizza together. I definitely recommend trying this you like pineapple and chicken on your pizza. The small is more than enough to feed one person. I usually save a slice or two for my dogs and they never complain."}
{"text":"Love the wings and pizza here. Delivery has never been late and they hire very friendly drivers. Barros has been around for a while, and for good reason. A massive step above the chain pizza delivery options."}
{"text":"Whoever made my small pepperoni, olive and mushroom pizza at 1pm today, thank you for the best pizza of my life. You have hands from the pizza gods and for that I am thankful. You should get a raise and all the pizza you want for the rest of your life and maybe even a puppy."}
{"text":"Since this is our home away from home, it's about time I put in a review.  Seriously, Kim already has our order at the counter waiting for us after she sees me pull into the parking lot.  If that doesn't say how much we like it....and how often we visit....well...it does.   The pizza is fantastic.  My husband moved here from New York and getting him to not make faces at every pizza place we went to was a challenge, until he met Barros.  We have a convert!  The environment is casual, the staff is friendly (By the way, I saw someone posted about a not nice cashier, about two years ago there was a particularly unfriendly cashier but she hasn't been there for some time), they are patient with my little ones.  It's the place that I let me three year old pay for the meal because it doesn't hold up a line and the staff smiles and interacts with them.  The lunch special prices are pretty much so low it's cheaper than eating at home.  A slice of pizza, salad bar, and a soda for $4.25?  A slice for $1.75?"}
{"text":"It is the closest pizza joint to our house so my husband and I order regularly.  Always nice girls answering the phone.  My only complaint is sometimes when we order wings they arrive at our home luke warm.  I am shocked by this because we live less than a mile away.  Other than that.....the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Pretty decent greasy pies  late nite delivery. You can't beat it  ... Yelp here we go"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place.  Been eating at Barros for more than 30 years... Still the same... Still delicious.  Service was fast and good and great lunch specials"}
{"text":"Barros pizza is the best!  Love the lunch specials two big slices and a soda for less than five bucks. Tender chewy crust and delicious. I love Barro's Pizza."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was lacking.  Cashier didn't know the menu and when they brought the food to our table it was bagged \"To-Go.\"  They seemed in a huge hurry even though the restaurant wasn't at all busy.  Must have been an off-night for them."}
{"text":"Everything I love about pizza! The perfect thick doughy crust, tomato sauce that's savory not sweet and toppings crisp from the oven."}
{"text":"Barro's is usually really great for a pizza.  Sometimes, like anyplace they have there off nights.  I caught one of those last night.  Being Friday night, they were likely busy but that shouldn't be an excuse for a bad pie.  Delivery driver was cool, but we were disappointed with our pizza last night.   Not a big deal, I know I get a lot out of constructive feedback so hopefully this accomplished the same."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Started with cheese garlic bread...top notch.  Best I have had in the area.  Wifey and I split pepperoni pizza.  Pizza was loaded with cheese, pepperoni, and had a good sauce.  Being a Chicago native, I am selective on my pie shops...but this one delivers."}
{"text":"Happened to go into Barro's tonight because it was next to Target and SuperCuts, and the kids were hungry, so pizza it is!  This location used to be Godfather's Pizza and they have done a complete overhauls. New tables, booths, dark wood furniture, tile, the works. It looks nice, but its also comfortable for the family.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful, so all in all a nice place to go in for dinner with the family.  Tonight we had hot wings, which were pretty good. Not the best I've had and far from the worse, just good.  The hubs and I ordered a small BBQ Chicken pizza to share and then two french bread pizza stick kids meals for our rugrats. My kids are both big pizza eaters, but one kids meal would have sufficed. The french bread pizza sticks were a foot long...definitely big enough for my 5 and 2 year old to share.   The BBQ pizza was  delicious, except for maybe a touch too much BBQ  sauce..I would request light sauce next time. The crust was puffy and yummy.  Definitely a place we'd go back to.  Oh and if you want to go get take out, then you can order a nice cold beer on tap and watch a game while you wait. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Although they did forget my cheese sticks I forgive them, but don't let it happen again :)"}
{"text":"A great deal, good food, tasty. Wings and pizza a la New York style.  I highly recommend this local chain. We have been here a few times and have come to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I grew up ordering Barro's and have started going back to it since the \"cheaper\" pizza options have increased their prices so much and are half the quality and flavor of Barros. Their honey BBQ wings are great and they offer a thin crust pizza too."}
{"text":"I like their pizza but they need to improve on their wings and maybe the cashier need to be little nicer...  I like the other locations better than the west side location."}
{"text":"This place is run by teenagers.  there were 5 of us with two separate orders.  the meals came out one at a time, in no order with lots of time in between and all were luke warm.  the last meal (ravioli) had to be asked for multiple times before it was ever brought out.  When asked why, the teenage girl/'server' said ' oh it is the boys. ' as if that is a proper explanation.  when they made the ravioli and finally brought that out, the rest of us were done and that meal wasn't even hot.  I will NEVER go back again."}
{"text":"Best pizza around and highly recommend it to everyone. Quick deliver y and the quality of pizza is top notch"}
{"text":"Been waiting for our pizza for over an hour and a half.  Rediculous.  Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Barro's is on the expensive side. This location is good but most of the time greasy pizza. I order the  XL pizza, 24 wings with salad. The pizza is nice and hot when I pick my order up. I was reading the reviews about the salad. I never had a problem with it just being croutons or all lettuce. Now one thing I have had is the wings over cooked. Fried to death!   This location is convenient but not one I would choose. But if you like brick oven cooked pizza, try the Barro's on Mckellips & Power."}
{"text":"food is good because it's Barros but the appetizers and salads come out with the pizza... this is the third time its happened. the location in QC is waaaay better."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Best pizza for chain in Phoenix and salads are ok. Price is about $16-18 for a large."}
{"text":"Barro's is my favorite pizza place nearby! I get the barro's special with extra sauce and some medium wings."}
{"text":"In the 80's I grew up on Barro's pizza when I lived in CA and was surprised there was a local franchise around the corner from our house. It literally has been since the 80's that I had eaten at Barro's.  Yesterday we were in the mood for a quick lunch and so we dropped in to try one of their specials.   We walked into a restaurant with only a handful of diners. We each ordered 2 slices, a salad and a drink special which was very reasonable for under $8.00. We got to choose from toppings from Hawaiian, pepperroni to a meat lover's type. The selection was unexpected since most specials limit you to a pepperoni, vegetarian etc..The pizza slices offered was more than enough and filling. If you like a thick crust,a lot of toppings and a lot of dough this is the place for you.  What we discovered was that the lunch was hearty (we could of shared one order) and two slices, was more than enough for lunch. As an extra bonus, the salad was nicely prepared with your choice of over 5 dressings and was a good portion.  All in all, except for the restaurant needing a little TLC and housekeeping, the servers were friendly, the pizza hearty and the price just right."}
{"text":"Always loved lunch specials. Recently had to go to a gluten-free diet and I love pizza. A lot of places offer them, some good, some real bad. Ordered one yesterday for pick up. Asked to cook it well done. I opened it up and was amazed. Tasted it just as good as it looked.  And it's not as pricey as most. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Waiting an hour and 15 minutes just to get an incorrect order,  and the worker that was on the phone  (girl) had an attitude telling me that I ordered a regular pepperoni pizza. Smh and still asked me to swap pizzas for my correct Barros special pizza. The service  was terrible if you ask me."}
{"text":"for a local chain this place is great! So happy they have gluten free pizza now!"}
{"text":"Nothing against the pizza or wings, it was good, it just wasn't our type. We spoil ourselves when it comes to the good ole' pizza & wings, so we were expecting a lot when we went there. The pizza was a medium & the bacon on top was a little burnt unfortunately, so we picked it off & it was also a tad bit soggy on the bottom. The wings were good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. If we were wanting something cheaper or hosting a party & needed a lot of food for a good price, I'd go back, otherwise probably not."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pizza! My favorite is the ham and pineapple dipped in mild wing sauce. Service is awesome."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Unfortunately unless it's lunch time, the customer service is pretty bad. I've ordered 2 around 8 pm and 9 pm and the service is lacking. The pizza has always been great so if service isn't an issue for you I'd definitely recommend. The salad bar has great options. Lots of seating. Great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Pizza was bland, as well as the chicken salad. The most disappointing part of the night zwas the kids who were running around the restaurant.  I was there with my kids and if staff allows kids to climb on the tables and act like morons, I guess they should change the name from Barro's to Chuckie Cheese.  I won't be back to this dump!  Be warned, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here.  The food and wings are delicious and the crust is very flavorful.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing.  When we want pizza, this is the place we go!"}
{"text":"Seldom does a manager make you feel so at home and is gracious and easy to work with.  On this visit, we met the manager, Brian Cambell and even though they were out of the gluten free crust, which is the reason we came, Brian went out of his way to apologize for the inconvenience and refund our money and encourage us to come back. He recommended us to another location, which was just as good.  We will be back to see Brian again. Thank you for making the extra effort."}
{"text":"Update 8/26/16  I complained to corporate and STILL have not heard back. Someone from the company commented about a week ago to my yelp review stating \"they are taking it serious and someone will reach out to me shortly\" it's been about and week and I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED.   I do not want a free pizza nor do i want 50 percent off. I want this issue to be handled properly and that manager Sean to be dealt with. This company slacks on all levels apparently. My resolution will eventually be taking this matter to a higher level."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location and it is very nice. Best one I have been in so far. Just discovered it the other day. Had no idea it was even here. Their pizza is good not the best. They have a lunch special two slices and a drink for $3. That is hard to beat. I guess I made the mistake of ordering a sub at a pizza place. My co workers wanted pizza but I was feeling sandwich. I should have gone to the sub place a few doors down I now discover. This was a bad sub. Really bad. It was more like an anti pasta salad on a bun. It is almost like they forgot they offer it on the menu because all the smart people are always ordering pizzas. Then they just threw this together. I sit ate it so it wasn't that bad but I will never order it again and I implore you gentle reader stay away from the subs. This is one place were you should fall in line with everyone else and order the pizza. That is what they do well. It should hurt the rating more than it does but the pizza, the lunch specials, the friendly staff and the very nice restaurant make up for it. It is very close to work so I will be back for lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend brought home a pie from Barro's with mushrooms and onions...oh my!  I couldn't believe how good the pizza was. It was deep dish with a thick, soft crust and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. I was in carb lover's heaven. The onions were fresh and aromatic. I couldn't stop eating it. I even ate a slice after my body told me that I had had enough. As I sat there with a belly ache, I still smiled from having had what was the best pizza I've eaten in a long time."}
{"text":"This place kicks a$$ for lunch. 2 slices and a drink for $4 (approx). The slices have always been good and hot, and i have never had an old cold slice! Plenty of indoor seating.."}
{"text":"Good pizza, clean restaurant. Plenty of dine in space. They have never messed up a pizza order, although there has been one or 2 questionable wings batches.. overall though nice place, with good service and consistency"}
{"text":"Yep, this was great pizza. Dough was perfectly fluffy, not too thin.  Could create an addiction if not careful. Good thing we don't have one where I live."}
{"text":"Friendly service. I love to take my family here every now and then for the lunch special. We can all get what we prefer as you can order by the slice. I like that I can get one slice and a salad. You can't beat the price! Their dressings are fantastic! They serve my favorite beer (Kiltlifter), so bonus points for that. The remodel looks great but my kids were unhappy to see one of their favorite games hadn't returned with it."}
{"text":"I was sick of the cookie cutter taste of the big chains, so I decided to try barro's. And so happy I did! I have only ordered their pizza but it is wonderful. Awesome flavor, great crust and sauce, they don't skimp on toppings. Will continue to order from them."}
{"text":"The lunch time deal is amazing. Good pizza, wings. It's nice if you wanna get out of the house but still have pizza. Def will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place, never have had a bad experience at the location even when it is super packed. Pizza is always on point and so are the wings- both boneless and bone-in. The salad bar is not anything special, but does the job when you feel the need for some veggies with your pizza.   This is my first choice for pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love Barros Pizza. They used to be in California and I was happy to see them here in Arizona. The pizza is still great and the wings are very good. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean and comfy.  The only check I could give them is that one day when we took the pizza home it was very greasy and I had to place paper towels on it to soak it up. But, the pizza, as usual, was very good."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Anthem, for sure. Not sure how exactly to explain it, and it isn't \"rock your entire world\" level pizza...but it's good. We get something like a \"meat-lover's pizza\" (my husband's choice, of course). And though I don't usually love sausage and all that meat, this pizza is really good.  We also love the antipasti salad--highly recommend a large pizza and a salad, for only two people we always have leftovers."}
{"text":"It was our first time to eat here and we were very glad we stopped. It was a very tasty pie at a great price. We will be back to try the pasta as well. Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing this location as the other locations are hit and miss. The one on Tatum and Dynamite was bad both times we went there. So, I go out of my way for this Barro's Pizza. The decor is similar to all locations. Very drab and not very comfortable. But, we are talking about a pizza joint, so they will get a pass on the decor.   I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was tasty and the perfect amount. I ate every bit of it with no crust leftovers. That was how outstanding it was.   I am surprised that the consistency between locations is such a wild swing from outstanding to mediocre at best. The owner should look into that."}
{"text":"great pizza and wings deal. takes a little time for delivery but well worth it. not only is the pizza some of the best in the area the wings are great as well!"}
{"text":"Easily some of the best pizza in town! The service is always great, always a smile on everyone's face and they are fast! If you enjoy fresh, cheesy, thick crust pizza this is the place for you."}
{"text":"MMMM... pizza. If you have been to any of the other valley Barro's, this one is very similar as far as menu and specials. The restaurant itself is a little more pictureque that others, with plenty of booths and tables.. Best deal is the lunch special.. i mean 2 slices and a drink for  $4 ............ NICE!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials here; $4 buys you two slices of pizza and a drink! The readymade pizzas are usually cheese, sausage and pepperoni (they have feature pizza's that rotate throughout the week). For a little more money you can even add wings or a salad. The service can be hit or miss (don't expect a clean table during lunch rush hours). The sauce is more on the savory/acidic side than sweet which I like and they're never stingy with the toppings. Warning- it may be a little greasy so don't be afraid to dab off the access grease with a napkin; your heart will thank you years from now."}
{"text":"Had a nice phone call with the manager here following my review of a dine-in experience that hadn't gone well the month before.  He took time to listen, got the facts / seemed familiar with the scenario.  He apologized for the poor service and offered me a couple of free pizzas next time we're in.  This is the way good customer service is done, and I appreciate it.  We'll be in again at some point.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Barro's  has great pizza but the Anthem store needs a new phone system.  On more than one occasion we have called to order and cannot get through for more than 30 minutes.  Usually just drive over and order.  Also they never have it ready when they say.  Always add 10 minutes and you'll be ok.  Barro's please add lines or order via the web. Get in the current technology decade could you?"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The pizza is by far the best over dominos. The place is very spacious. The staff are all very nice and happy to work."}
{"text":"Pleased with our first dinner from Barros. Reasonably priced for what you get. Impressive We had it delivered and it took about 50 min for delivery so not too impressive but we weren't starving so it was ok. The pizza was very good. Side Salad was very good too along with 1000 island sauce. Strange when I opened the paper bag the dressing was in there were just a few pieces of celery stuck in there. We will order from here again. Husband says they are the best bone in delivery wings he has ever had and we will for sure be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best pizzas in Phoneix! I have been here twice for takeout and once to eat in. They have a nice selection of draft beer and the food is really good. Staff was great also! I love to come here when I'm on this side of town and in the mood for pizza, it's definitely the best pizza in Laveen!"}
{"text":"Barros pizza has been a Friday night staple since the early 1990s in our house. We go to this one because it's the closest. We have had decent service and pretty good food. We like to get their thin crust (which is like most people's regular crust). Otherwise it's a very thick pizza you will be eating. I like that their sauce for their pizza is distinctive. I think a lot of pizza's taste the same but I can def. tell the difference of a Barros pizza. We had some issues with our mozzarella sticks having no cheese in them once but I told a worker and they gave us new ones. I think it's reasonably priced, and my kids like going in because they have a little play area."}
{"text":"Went in there again today for lunch and ordered two slices and a beverage. Large pieces of pizza and great prices!   If you are looking for a good meeting spot, quick bite to eat, or good energy for lunch, I recommend it."}
{"text":"We love Barros pizza in Cave creek so decided to try the Anthem one when we were up in the area. Never again! First pizza we got was the BBQ chicken. When we got it home the chicken was cold and not cooked. The crust was soggy and we could not even eat it. We called and talked to the manager and that was a joke. She was rude and wasn't even apologetic. We were up in the area again last night and figured they couldn't mess up a regular pepperoni pizza. Boy were we wrong. Pizza was super thin, soggy and dripping with grease! I'm not sure what's going on with this location. Barro's pizza is my favorite but I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza your are going to find in the East Valley. I go to this Barro's twice a month i have never been let down. Food is alway good, Service is great. You just cant go wrong. I have been to a few other Barro's In the East Valley and this one shines above the rest for me."}
{"text":"I've never been let down in the 15 yrs I've been enjoying Barro's food. You have to think about 15 year's numerous locations food always taste great!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. They do ok with gluten free pizza, although it's just a frozen crust. Soggy at times. Biggest complaint... when you order online and pay online, you still have to wait in the long line to pick up your order. Isn't that the whole point of online pay/order. So my pizza is hot, ready, and paid for BUT I have to wait 15 minutes in line to have it??? Thanks for a cold soggy pizza!!"}
{"text":"This review is for takeout only.  Called for takeout and they answered quickly. I ordered 3 large pizzas and she repeated my order for clarification. Said it would be ready in 25 minutes. Arrived at the restaurant after 20 minutes and I was surprised at how large the seating area was. And it seems necessary because there were plenty of folks there on a Saturday afternoon. plenty of tvs for sports. We got our pizza and headed out. It was quite good. Soft, thick crust and really good cheese.  Will likely return again."}
{"text":"Barros is and always will be our favorite pizza!! Great service and amazing pizza and wings. Any location you go to will be great."}
{"text":"Good pizza!!! Great customer services need to work on getting the flies out of their guarding the pizza with my life because it's so good"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Prices are much more affordable than my other 'go to'  place. I have ordered cheese & sausage pizza. I prefer the sausage. I ordered boneless chicken hot & sweet BBQ...neither disappointed.  For 2 large one topping pizzas I paid about 26. For large or extra large not sure & 24 wings think I was at 30."}
{"text":"I have to say I have been going to barrows pizza for years and have never been disappointed. The food was always good the service is for the most part good. The pizza and got wings are GRRREEEAAAT.. A must go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Went out to lunch for my birthday with my husband and decided to try stop in. The menu was easy to understand. We got a small 2 item pizza and garlic bread with cheese. The garlic bread wasn't like other pizza places garlic bread, it was actual French bread that was halved. I love cheese and it was smothered in cheese and very garlicky :). The pizza was the best pizza I've had aside from a pizza place back home. Can't wait to other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Flavorful pizza! Chewy crust and tastes like they use a very good quality mozzarella. This location is a little busy so we called in our order for pick up. Nice girls in the front they've been courteous and prompt. Took us awhile to try because we were hesitant to steer away from the cheaper pizza places but, so worth it."}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona and we found our \"go to\" pizza place! Not only is the pizza perfect in every way, it is reasonably priced. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Management allowed people to bring in dogs into the restaurant and let the dogs sit in the booths , they were not service dogs. service dogs don't sit on the seats. This is clearly a health food violation, I will never return to Barros as long as they condone inconsiderate people to bring animals into a restaurant. I understand service dogs and the need for them, I'm fine with that. It's people like this should have no regard for anyone else or the health and safety of others. I will contact the health department about this."}
{"text":"It's pizza, thicker crust with little to no flavor, pretty generous with the toppings, though. There are a lot of better options around for decent pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is so great! Spaghetti and meatballs were amazing as well as the ravioli! I crave this place. The pizza was thin but crust was thick. All texture was perfect and the sauce and cheese melted in your mouth. Another satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"We found our new Pizza Joint that's for sure! When my husband was in the Navy we lived in Virginia for 4 years and we discovered Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Since we've been back to AZ no one could meet our needs for a buffalo chicken Pizza until YOU GUYS! It was Amazing! We got the XL Pizza and 24 wing deal with two salads I think it totaled 35-40 bucks which was super cheap with all the food we got. All their prices are decent and they have a smoking lunch menu one slice and a drink for 2.50. It was nice because they accommodated making our Pizza a bit different so our daughter could have just plan cheese! The girls at the counter were super nice. Interacted with my daughter and talked to her about her Trolls which is always nice when she is included! The salad bar was on point! Had all the awesome toppings! We got the honey hot wings ! Yum-O ! Very clean! Soda station was well kept. We will back often to get our fill for Pizza and wings! Dining area was large with booths and tables. Staff was working hard! Always nice to see! Keep it up! See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"This is a copy of the letter I sent to Barro's:  Today was the second time I patronized Barro's Pizza in Laveen. The first time was last week. At that time after getting home I discovered the order was wrong. Upon calling the store and speaking to the manager I was given a credit in the amount of the wrong item. But only after I told the manager I was not driving back to the store to correct the employe's error.  I gave Barro's a second chance and they failed. This time I asked for boneless wings with sauce on the side and upon getting home I discovered I was given regular wings and no sauce on the side.  I returned to the store this time, furious that I gave Barro's two chances and both times my order was wrong. I try very hard to patronize local business instead of national chains, but in the case of Barro's, you have given me no alternative.  I will never again patronize Barro's. Not here in Laveen, not anywhere. The store manager, Kenny was apologetic and refunded me the cost of the wings and even provided me the correct order.   I'm sorry but that is not enough. I am not looking for any special or extra compensation. I simply am telling you that I will never again patronize any of your establishments.  I cannot stress enough how disappointed I am with the lack of service and utter incompetence with this Barro's location. I confirmed my order three times with Arial and once with Kenny on the phone and it was still wrong. How does something like that happen?   I can tell you how. Kenny was dressed unprofessionally. Sneakers and shorts with an un-tucked polo shirt. Two of the young ladies working were wearing gang color bandana's on their heads. And every employee I saw, which was approximately ten, had to be under the age of 23. Most of them were probably around 20.  How does a business expect to thrive when it hires kids who's only concern is to get out of work so they can go play with their friends? Why does a business hire kids who have no work ethic and simply do not care about the customers and doing their job right?  I understand that for a business such as this the unskilled labor pool you can pull from is mostly just high school and college kids, but that is no excuse for the horrible job they do.   I am sending this as a message and not posting it on your page so as to not publicly embarrass you. On the other hand you could just simply delete any post that is placed here.  Additionally, there is no link I can find on your web site to leave feedback. I wonder why that is.  Rest assured that in addition to me never again patronizing Barro's I will do everything possible to ensure that none of my friends ever do either."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house and I order pizza from here a lot. It's an order at the cash register, laid back pizza joint. I love their pizza crust. I order a veggie with no cheese or I order a pizza with no cheese and just olives and mushrooms. Their pizza dough is vegan and they won't put any butter or anything on there if you just let them know you have an allergy. They're good for dine in or pick up. One time they got our order wrong (not surprisingly). My mom asked for a jalapeño pizza bur they gave her a plain cheese pizza. I had already gone home before I noticed. I called back and the manager gave us the option to remake the pizza or give us a voucher. I liked that they made up for messing up the order. It's a great pizza spot if you're vegan and like me don't care for vegan cheese."}
{"text":"Best pizza you can get for only $3! Really, it taste much better thank most other pizza, and a very affordable price! Best cheese!"}
{"text":"Love this place just got back intown and it was Pizza Monday and why not Barros... 2 thumbs up Pizza was awesome as always..."}
{"text":"So I ordered 24 honey bbq wings from this place. I was told by Heidi that the wait was going to be 45 minutes to an hour for delivery, which was fine so I ordered. After I got off the phone my husband says to me \"That wait time is way too long for a Tuesday afternoon, I'm starving lets just get Dominos', their wait time is 20-30 minutes.\" So I agree with my husband and I called Barro's promptly to cancel my order. Heidi answers and says ok we will cancel the order for the wings. My order was placed at 3:56pm. I cancelled my order at 4:02pm. At 4:09 a delivery guy knocks at my door with 24 wings. I paid for the wings  because they came super fast and it saved me from having to leave the house so it was a win win. Here's my beef with Barro's: my wings came without honey bbq sauce. The plus side is that I was offered new wings free of charge. I feel like the cooks rushed my order, and when I tried to cancel they tried to force these half ass wings on me. To send me wings without any sauce whatsoever is just ridiculous. Especially when my receipt reads \"24 Boneless Honey BBQ.\" Mistakes happen, but this was no mistake. Barro's started making the wings and didn't want to waste them. But if the wings only took 13 minutes to cook and deliver why was I told it would be a 45 minute wait? The good news is that now you guys know that you can order from this place then cancel and they will speed up your delivery time... Get it together Barro's!"}
{"text":"We usually have good experiences here but last night we ordered their Mega Meat in the top of it look like somebody took a torch to it. Complete charcoal. Not sure if I will be ordering again or from NYPD pizza.  It won't let me paste a pic. That's sad."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. I think it's the crust and sauce. It's the real deal! No sagging pizza. I also like having a variety of salads to choose from, yummy cheese sticks and their bbq wings. Whenever the kids ask about pizza for dinner, they are referring to Barro's. Nothing else! There are delivery options too!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best pizza I've had in the west valley. BBQ Chicken is amazing and their bread sticks are the best."}
{"text":"A special thank you for the delicious pizza that Barro's on Riggs donated to the Perry High School Freshman Football teams."}
{"text":"Love this pizza, so fresh.  I love to take my kids to Barros for a special dinner.  My husband loves the wings so the whole family is happy when we go"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Mesa. I love their wings, pizza, and breadsticks. The sauce for both the wings and pizza is great! The environment is decent and clean. The staff are nice. They have great lunch specials, too! I usually get a small salad and slice of pizza for super cheap!"}
{"text":"Really good place to eat but really rude cashier. I asked her if we can split the check between two cards and she said no give one card and pay each other later. She made things so difficult and was very unprofessional. Great place to eat tho."}
{"text":"Up to now the customer service has been good. Tonight the staff was horrible. To the detriment of not only my wallet but another family as well.  I placed an order for a large and a medium pizza.  They made two larges and charged me for it. They were willing to fix it if I waited another 20 minutes to make a medium. I didn't have the time to wait.  The other family didn't even order wings but the person at the counter put it in the order and charged the family.  They paid without realizing.    While I was getting our sodas I heard two other staff explaining what they had done to that Mexican family. Then one asked the other to deliver the wings.  THEY ACTUALLY HAD THE GALL TO DO IT!  Horrible, horrible horrible !!!!  The girl who delivered the wings didn't offer to fix the situation by offering a refund. They merely stated the mistake they made and left the wings on the table.  That entire front counter crew knew it. Did it. Have no shame.  They need the old crew back."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Barro's in Mesa, AZ.  The GM is great, hard working and cares about his customers. The Staff are wonderful. Great pizza, and alcoholic beverages. You must check it out!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Barros since 1994. Family owned, and established in Phoenix for as long as I can remember.  Always fresh, quality, and super reasonable on price. Don't forget to check out their lunch special, which hasn't changed much since I first started eating there."}
{"text":"Barro's has the meltiest cheesiest Pizza ever! It's so worth all the extra calories! Besides, who eats pizza when they're on a diet?   Their wings are perfection! I'm a wing person and so the sauce is just as important as the bird. (They're really saucy, for those of you wondering.) But I've never had a sauce like it before! It's not that typical vinegary clear wing sauce that you see everywhere nowadays. It's more of a creamy hot sauce which I've only seen Barro's make. So every once in a while, more often than not, I'll crave their wings. The only downfall, if you can really call it that, is they take a little longer to come out so you have to have at least an hour to just sit down and eat. Not everything is fast food and with perfection you must be patient."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price of Barros. Consistently good too."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. I love there cheese pizza or Kona pizza, $$ not that cheap but not to expensive great dine in area. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went in today for a few slices, and the service of the girl at the front counter was awful. I was not greeted, smiled at, nothing. When she was taking my order she was leaning, hunched on the counter. No eye contact, no smiling. She handed me my change in which I said \"Thanks a bunch!\" And she ignored me and said nothing as I walked out. I understand working customer service sucks sometimes, but I mean if you hate your job, get a new one. Or just pretend like you're happy. If you're at the front register of any store, you are the face of that store and your attitude makes or breaks the experience for the customer. So two stars for service. At least my pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not a big pizza person but they have the best pizza here and there wings are the bomb"}
{"text":"We don't go to this location often, but when we do it's usually around lunch. Without fail, we always get the same young lady (with darker lipstick) taking our order. She is always eager to take our order but always falls short of gratitude once the order is paid for. Hands the food over quickly and turns around immediately or speeds off. It's never busy when we're there so I'm pretty sure she has a split second in her schedule to say thank you, smile, or ask if there's anything else we need. I'm not asking for a lot, just a bit of recognition that the customer exists in front of her and gratitude for choosing their restaurant.  With that said, the food is always good and tables are always clean."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for delivery from here several times a year ago and each time it was a soggy greasy mess so we quit using them and started using another delivery place for our twice monthly \"pizza nights\".  This weekend we decided to give them another try since it had been so long since we have had Barro's. Our pizza was delivered and both pizza's were a soggy greasy mess and this time they were cold.  The wings were good but we didn't enjoy the pizza at all. Back to the other place for our pizza deliveries."}
{"text":"UPDATE: i have changed my review to 5 stars. My comment below still applies, but the pizza has just been so good lately, they have to earn 5 stars. ---------------------- Their pizza is usually pretty good. They have decent dough (if you like a slightly thicker crust) sauce is great and toppings are fresh (not canned) and plentiful.  The only problem is when you call to place your order. You will be put on hold. And I mean you will ALWAYS be put on hold. Try it! I have ordered maybe 20+ times and 20/20 its, \"thank you for calling, please hold.\" It's so routine that it's comical.  When you go into the store you'll see about a dozen or so kids just meandering about, folding boxes, talking, whatever. If the phone rings, they will walk over, answer, put on hold, then go back to their \"work\" or whatever... It is absolutely hilarious- but sometimes it's rather annoying,  Barros- Please stop making PPH (Putting People on Hold) part of your training process. It is okay to just answer the phone and take the order. Surely, you can train all your employees to accomplish this task.  You will receive 5 stars if you can fix this!"}
{"text":"Great service from super friendly teens working the front counter. Been coming to this location for over 23 years, and it's just as good, if not better, as the first time I put a slice of Barros pizza in my face. The crust,  the sauce, the toppings...everything is fresh fresh fresh, and quailty. Even my bf from CHICAGO says this is his favorite pizza joint, and out baby loves gnawing on the flavorful pizza crust. Thank you for 23+ years of awesome"}
{"text":"The establishment is always clean, which is no surprise because their servers are always immediately cleaning up after customers. If I had to show someone a good pizza place in town to go to, I'd choose this Barro's. The option of splitting toppings on your pizza is awesome too, though I'm sure most pizza places allow that nowadays. There's always been plenty of parking, it's never too noisy, and it seems like a great place to bring your family (I always see people there who seem to have just gotten out of a little league game or a family hang out)."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Once I order and sat down I was happy to get my pizza in a speedy time The pizza look good and tasted good too. Very filing. I am sure that I will return to this place for another pizza. When ordering I notice on the wall you could see what you could have, but the specialty pizzas didn't have any prices. I wonder why? Not to sure why they don't let you know. Also why I was ordering you can see the workers in the kitchen. I notice that none of them were wearing hair nets or gloves..."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizzas and wings (and sodas) on the night of the Mayweather fight which I understood was a busy night. They told us it would be about an hour or an hour and a half. Ok fine with that. After 2 hours we called and were informed that our pizza had already been delivered! So manager calls and explains that the already paid for food was delivered to the wrong place and the driver didn't ask for ID or the card for proof so some random person got fully paid for food. The fact that we are all super hungry really escalated the anger but manager refunded us and told us the order would be delivered in 30 minutes.   If you call in your order and pay with card, REQUEST that they ask for identification upon delivery!! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in to order a pizza. We got a small cheese and a small sausage. My wifes pizza came out at a reasonable time and they said mine would be out in a few minutes. 40 minutes later I asked them where my pizza was and they said that it had not been made yet, they would get on it. I told them that my wife's pizza was already cold because we would like to eat together and to cancel my pizza and give me my money back. An hour goes by and they bring a pepperoni pizza out and I said no it needs to be cancelled and it was a sausage pizza not a pepperoni so I would just like my money back for my pizza. So we continue to eat my wife's small cheese pizza. 15 minutes later they bring out a half raw sausage pizza, that the dough was half cooked and not edible. There was only us and one other table in the entire restaurant. I said I wanted my money back and the server said they had already started running the pizza through so it was my pizza and they would not refund me my money. We ended up leaving the pizza on the table even though we paid for it and we left. We love Barros pizza and have been to numerous different locations but we moved to Moon Valley area just recently and we tried this location on 7th street and in the future my wife and I will  drive to another Barrows location than going back to this location. Where did customer service go!!!! Would never recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza, however I am now forced to be Gluten Free. I was delighted to find they have a GF pizza. It was a nice treat. The crust is more like a thick cracker but, without any other options for pizza it will do to curb the craving. The toppings and sauce were yummy as always."}
{"text":"Barro's is out favorite pizza in Anthem.  It is also one of the few that also offer sit down area in a clean, comfortable environment (not waiter service).  Also they have the best wings in Anthem, with an overall rating of very good (I'm so picky about wings - it is hard to get to great on my scale).  Their biggest sin is the pool of sauce for the wings.  By my calling, you should not need a napkin after each wing, they should have a light coating of sauce.  Anyway, Barros is good pizza at a good value (with a coupon)  standard pricing tends to get a little high.  Given the options in Anthem (and the loss of Rosati's - which got the other 50% of our pixzza business), this is our go to place for 'za."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas i ever tasted it hit the spot nice service too great tasting pizza gast delivery too"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday with colleagues from work.  We were very happy with the prices on the lunch specials. The pizza was very good. The lunch special features pre-made slices of regular crust pizza (cheese, pepperoni, or the special of the day). The texture of the crust was just right.  The salad bar is small and not anything special, but everything seemed fresh.   The service was excellent and the restaurant is spacious and clean.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza! I've ordered from them a bunch and had Several different kinds of pizza from them and they've always been great.  Delivery time is pretty average compared to others which is fine; I figure if I want it sooner I can just pick it up myself.  They've always been friendly when they deliver and on the phone, and they have good wings as well for any wings lovers :p"}
{"text":"They have some good pizza, I enjoyed the crust a lot. I would definitely come back here given I could find another deal."}
{"text":"Hey barros. Love your pizza. Your ladies who answer the phones need to be customer service minded. They mostly sound annoyed, rushed, and just unhappy. It makes the experience of getting delivery start on a bad foot. Something to consider.  This place is huge. Put some video games in it! A shuffle board, anything! Would be way more fun if you made it more enjoyable place to chill. We went there with another family and the kids were bored to tears. We would have stayed for more food and beers if hey had more to do. Pizza was good per usual."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing pizza wings & bread sticks. everything is always super fresh & delicious. and as for customer service everyone there is nice & polite. it's always clean. I'm just in love with barros tbh"}
{"text":"Kona pizza, great pizza. Visiting with my wife. We dropped by for some drinks and pizza after flying in. The Kona was a little sweet and very chessy. Very enjoyable pizza."}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves Barro's!   We've been ordering delivery from them for years from pizza to salads to wings.  Pizza has always been fresh and hot. It's NOT greasy, lacking cheese, or too thin. It's delicious! The antipasto salad is so yummy with pizza, my favorite.  My kids have tried almost every boneless wing and have enjoyed each one."}
{"text":"OK so I normally don't post reviews but I feel like I should after reading all the negative comments .. My family and I as well as several friends have gone to or eaten from this location almost weekly since it opened .. Lets address a couple things 1. staff is young: yes they are (not sure why that deems a negative mark) they are friendly and we were always greeted quickly and asked if we have been to barro's before then asked to step up to place an order when ready .. 2. long wait for food: if you want pizza fast go pick up a hot n nasty for $5 bucks ... There is a wait its prepared fresh and baked while you wait was it too long? Nope 3. Poor wings: I've had wings from a ton of different places over the years and true it may not be best ever compared to a wing specialty establishment it holds its own and then some for a pizza first joint ... Do yourself a favor and go its great pizza with a nice sit down family atmosphere just remember it isn't a fast food pizza chain!!"}
{"text":"Wings and pizza? What else could you ask for? A beer? Oh wait they have that too! We order from this location 2-3 times monthly and it's always great! We order the XL pepperoni pizza and traditional hot wings (Extra Crispy) and wouldn't change our order for anything! Or needles to say where we order it from. Fast service, great food, and easy on the wallet. Some times service is a little rough but lately seems to be more upbeat! Thanks Barro's!"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good but service can be dreadfully slow. Ordered takeout and they never made the pizza."}
{"text":"Pros -  1. Great pizza all the time (consistent) 2. Best lunch special!!! 3. Hot wing pizza is LIFE 4. Decent salad bar  Cons 1. Service is c- at best 2. Little dirty inside(lack of management maybe?) 3. Delivery drivers always late and not very polite (best to pick up) 4. Salad bar needs to be freshened up more often"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in Barro's tonight. My husband and I are frequent customers. We ordered our food at 8:15 pm and received my husbands wings about 10 min. later. The young lady said the rest of the food would be out shortly. Needless to say I had to go ask at the counter when my food would be coming after we waited at least another 5 to 10 min. I returned to our booth and waited again. I finally went back to the counter and they were just about to bring out my food. I waited 37 minutes for my food to come. The young man \"manager\" tried to tell me that it take at least 20 minutes to cook the pizza. I tried to explain everything but he just wouldn't stop and listen. It was not very busy so I don't see why it took so long."}
{"text":"Pizzas are good, wings and subs are great. Price is a little high for a restaurant like this but you can sometimes get coupons.   They also have a good deal on an extra large pizza and a whole chicken's worth of wings if you're trying to feed an army."}
{"text":"Funny ordered food ,paid look up and they charged me full price and they had a special. Said something to the cashier and she said oh sorry .never fixed the price never gave me a refund .never said we'll straighten it out .what a bunch of thieves."}
{"text":"This is a standard Barrro's - great pizza, big space/lots of seating, beer! This location is kind of tucked away in a corner. Not very many people in there on a Sunday afternoon, but for under $15 we got a large pizza and two drinks. The service was OK and the tables were awfully dirty - reason for loss of a star. Would recommend for anyone who likes thick crust pizza and quality ingredients. Good place to watch a game, eat pizza, and have a beer."}
{"text":"Still think this place has the best tasting pie in town, however, the service needs a little help. I am not sure if they were understaffed, but I noticed a customer was upset from waiting so long. The girl at the front was a little rude and not empathetic toward the customer. I then, decided to leave because of the way they handled the situation"}
{"text":"After hour & 40 minutes of waiting... cold pizza & wings spilled everywhere is what we get. Not the first time this has happened... but definitely will be the last time we order from this location."}
{"text":"We came in at about 8:45 and were told that the dining room closed at 9:30. This was disappointing. However, the door says that the dining room closes 30 minutes before store close. We tried to eat quickly, but they didn't deliver our one of our pizzas until around 9:15. Just before 9:30, the lights went on and the tvs went off. I'm sure this is standard procedure, but it was frustrating because we didn't get our food until 15 minutes before close due to a kitchen error. The food was fine, but it felt very discourteous due to the circumstances that were the fault of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Decided to order sandwiches for pick up on our way home. We called in our order and were told 15 minutes.   By the time we arrived it had been our 15 minutes. We waited while customer after customer picked up their pizza and wing orders. A girl asked what we were waiting for and then went to the back to check on our order.  We were told five more minutes. Then another girl asked then went to the back to check again. Finally we received our order (two Italian subs cold on white). Nothing special. We arrived home to two subs. No cheese. No dressing and tomato wedges off the salad bar for the sandwich tomatoes. It's not like we were not regular customers. We know what is supposed to be on the sandwich. Thanks for letting us know we are far to much work for you."}
{"text":"I been coming here since I was a kid and I love it! I could never get sick of this pizza. Something magical about the sauce they use, and the crust is very original.  I now live in California and I rarely get a chance to enjoy Barros.  I have yet to find a pizza place in California that compares.  Barros come to Southern California please!!!!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite pizza!! If you are looking for thick crust, this is the place to go! And the prices are way reasonable! If you go in during lunch you can get the lunch special and the pizza is super quick to get!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good usually pretty greasy, Wing are great, usually pretty busy, I've only had one bad experience when they forgot are order, but they usually are pretty quick at making are food. There food is well priced"}
{"text":"I don't usually post pictures with my reviews, but Barro's Pizza deserves a special exception. I ordered a Large Anchovy Pizza, and it was swimming in oil. Like, the box was soaked. This was the greasiest, oiliest pizza I have ever had. You can see for yourself in the photo I posted.  Also, notice the lack of anchovies. There were barely any on the pizza. Considering it was the only topping I ordered, you'd think they would put more on there. And it's too bad because I was really craving anchovies for some reason.  Let's talk about the sauce. It's weak. It tastes like it was store bought. Another let down.  The ONLY thing saving Barro's Pizza from a one star review is that the service was quick and friendly. I should also mention that the value wasn't dreadful at $12 for a one-topping large pizza. In the end, Barro's Pizza earns two stars, and a finger-point of shame."}
{"text":"definitely a higher quality pizza here compared to all the chained pizza places in our area! pizza hut or papa johns dont compare to barros fresh ingredients and amazing crust and cheese! Never had a problem here they always get our order right and we can tell was made fresh unlike the other that speed the process up and always mess up!  Great quality here and amazing service keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza! Consistently good. Will also say the service at this location is always phenomenal! We go with friends often and split an order of pizza and wings and they have always accommodated splitting the wings and check, etc. Food as good as the service!"}
{"text":"2.4/5 stars - Can't decide if this pizza was actually good or bad. Kind of tasted like a freshly made frozen pizza if that makes any sense. Crust wasn't thick or thin and had a lot of bubbles, can't remember the sauce, and the cheese was thin. Kind of reminded me of a very good Totinos Party Pizza."}
{"text":"Barro's is the place to go if you want inexpensive high quality pizza in a relaxed atmosphere. They have the best bubbly crust (I always go for the slices with the biggest bubble...not sure why) and the prices are definitely fair.   One complaint that I would have is about the staff. From what I can recall, I've never seen an employee that doesn't look to be in high-school. The high school students can be a bit apathetic and absent minded at times.  The restaurants are always clean and well-kept, and they even have a limited draught beer selection."}
{"text":"This pizza is hard to beat!  I've been going here for years and am always satisfied with the quality of the pizza and the service."}
{"text":"I am a die-hard Barros fan! I grew up with this pizza and I just love everything here so much... Which is why it pains me to give this location only TWO stars.   I went here on a Tuesday night after work for a quick dinner with my husband. We got a medium BBQ chicken pizza, amazing! The gal taking our order was pleasant.   The two stars is given because of the poor state of the salad bar. I'm not sure if this place just doesn't get a rush hour (it was completely empty the entire time we were there). But the salad bar was so poorly stocked, quite disheveled, the ice berg lettuce looked three days old - was wilted and wasn't chopped to a reasonable size - more like pulled apart carelessly. The tomatoes were old and mushy, some starting to rot, several containers or condiments were basically empty.   I know this isn't a salad place, it's a pizza joint. But every other Barros I've been too has always taken care of their salad bars.   When this salad bar is right by the registers there really isn't an excuse to not tend to it or keep clean and stocked.   Since I am a huge fan, and I work in the area, I will try to come back during lunch to see if there are any improvements to the salad bar.    *****Update***** On 7/18 I ordered a small spicy southwestern chicken pizza. When it was delivered all of the toppings were tipped to the side as if someone dropped it or it was tilted. My office is less than 10 mins way from this location, my car was getting repaired so I didn't have a vehicle to grab lunch somewhere and this was pretty much the only place that delivers. Very disappointed.  I did call and ask for a refund. The manager, John, was very nice and refunded my order. Just bummed because this is my second not to great experience at just this location. And from the other reviews it seeks to be the only consistent thing at this location. So I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Usually my family enjoys dining at this location, but ordered delivery Sun March 17th.  I was put on hold 3 times when I called. I was asked for my phone number twice and my address 3xs.   The delivery guy came missing a ranch, he offered to come back, but I declined since 20 minutes is the round trip. He had no napkins, parm cheese or peppers. He said the store was out.... Ok?? This would be like ordering sushi and there being no soy sauce, wasabi or ginger. These items are staples to the food.  I called the store to express my disappointment to a smart ass asst manager. I was told that their delivery was coming the next day and they usually run out of peppers & parm quickly. When I asked why they don't order more at a time, he said he isn't in charge of ordering. He asked 3xs if I wanted the ranch delivered and I told him no 3xs. Never once did he attempt to apologize.  I called back Tuesday when the GM Matt Barro was in. He apologized for my experience and stated there was a box of parm & peppers in the store, he would look into the matter and make sure my cc was charged correctly. I asked him to give me a call back, he repeated my phone number and I have yet to hear back... DISAPPOINTING! I would have never ordered if I was told they were out of those items. I am even more upset that the general manager didn't follow up with me."}
{"text":"Visited tonight with my family, a party of 9. We ordered 3 pizzas, wings, sodas and beers(bottles only).I even tipped when I ordered. The service wasn't impressive. At one point there were 5 not busy employees in the front and I had to ask for the trash to be cleared off our table. Most of the trash was picked up, but they didn't come back til sometime later to finish clearing table. Who wants to sit at a dirty table? I assume there was one, possibly two managers on shift. One guy (a manager?) asked a few tables how their service was, but never made his way to us. Wouldn't you think management would ask the largest party how things were?"}
{"text":"when your location opened i told the manager that if this restaurant was going to achieve success was that their food and customer service was going to have to be better than everyone else. now you guys are just as bad as native newyorker. i placed an order for delivery and it was completely wrong. you are better off dining in!! too bad this restaurant is just going to be another bad laveen restaurant to go to. when are owners going to wake up. i mean i own my own business here in laveen and customer service should be #1 with quality right behind it! i'm sure management will read this  and do nothing about it because as long as they hit their numbers the owners will not care!!"}
{"text":"I stop for lunch here 2-3 times per month.  I order one slice of pizza, a salad and a diet coke for $4.77.  The pizza is always good, hot and served quickly.  The salad is fresh but they do kinda short ya on the amount of dressing they give you.    I dont think you can find a better place to grab a quick bite to eat for less than $5.  You could always try Taco Bell but does anyone really know what the meat is there anyway........"}
{"text":"seriously, the best pizza in Arizona! Always fresh, always delicious! The crust is the best pizza crust in the world! Love you mesa Barro's!"}
{"text":"I love eating here. I am picky and the deal with me. Always a treat.  The counter staff is always upbeat and working. The managers are great. They always come check out the dinning room."}
{"text":"A couple of my girlfriends and I were going out for lunch after shopping. Shopping at superstition springs mall can really work up an appetite,But I won't eat at that food court even if someone else is buying. My friend Nancy said she smelled pizza. Pizza sounded good to all of us and I remembered seeing a Barro's pizza on power. I had never eaten their . Many of my friends have told me the pizza was great so it seemed like a good time to find out. Walked right in and sat down. Server showed up within a minute. Were served our drinks within 3 minutes and or pizza was done in about 15. The pizza was what everyone had said it was. I would say it was the best pizza I have ever tasted. I had pizza in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and countless other towns around the United States, This was the best. We were happy with the price the service and the food. All in all a great time I feel their is to be had there and I do highly recommend  Barro's to everyone that enjoy's pizza"}
{"text":"Fourth time here, this was very good pizza tonight and fresh salad bar. When this place runs well they have good food, if not everything gets screwed up. Too bad they weren't more like a sports bar.."}
{"text":"Do you want a good pizza at a reasonable price for your family Friday pizza night? Then this locally owned and operated chain of pizza places is the place to go. I've been eating their pizza for close to 20 years and the consistency has stayed the same throughout. We usually opt for their daily special of two large one topping pizzas for $19.99. They do deliver but the restaurant is less than a mile from the house so we pick them up in less than 20 minutes.   While they do offer other things on their menu such as salad and wings, occasionally we order some of their wings. The medium sauce isn't too hot for the younger kids either in our home. They have locations all over the valley and I haven't found bad service at any of their locations yet.   If you want just a slice or two for lunch, they do offer that as well. Barro's is our \"let's get a quick pizza\" place. Check out barrospizza.com for their locations and menu. Even the gluten free menu they have for those who need that."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the food and delivery here, since I haven't been inside this particular location.  The delivery was fast (under 30 min) and everything was just as I ordered. The pizza was hot and really quite delicious. Soft crust and the perfect ratio of cheese and sauce. I also had a salad that was fresh, crisp, and had lots of toppings (crunchy croutons, chopped onions, finely sliced mushrooms, fresh green peppers and cold dressing on the side).  It all really hit the spot and I was impressed by every aspect! I recommend giving it a try for the quality and freshness."}
{"text":"I had Barro's deliver pizzas for a birthday party with ~25 guests.   Everyone was enjoyed the pizza and wanted to take the leftovers home with them.  I called ahead by ~2 hours, ordered ten (10) pizzas of varying types.  The pizzas were delivered hot, fresh, on time, in the correct quantity and type with great quality.  We order for ourselves from this Barro's and they have never gotten an order wrong or otherwise had a negative experience."}
{"text":"For the price, you definitely get what you pay for at Barro's.  The pizza isn't amazing, but it's filling and decent enough for a lunch-on-the-go.  Their lunch buffet special is really affordable, though, so they usually fill up fast around noon on weekdays.  If you go, expect to wait in a line for a few minutes."}
{"text":"my husband LOVES this place for pizza.  we often get the pizza and wings deal that there are coupons floating around for, especially when we have family visiting.  It's better than little caesars, dominos, etc, but not as good as Vitos.  The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We have lived up here for years, and have eaten and had takeout/delivery. I really enjoy their food, but the happy staff that work there are the best. Today, great smile, willing to change order without whining, and good attitude. Thats what I call customer service!"}
{"text":"Love love love their pizza and prices!! I never order take out anymore after countless screw ups by cheap delivery pizza places around here (just gross). I'm thankful we have a Barros close to enjoy tasty pizza for a decent price. Queen Creek HS football even has a dicount card they sold for Barros. Love their lunch specials (under $5 bucks for slices and a drink). Seating can accommodate a variety of group sizes."}
{"text":"Like Heaven on Earth! The most terrific pizza ever and their lunch specials are the best in town. This really is my favorite pizza because they have the best sauce and semi-thick crust. I only wish they had more locations, especially one by me in the northeast valley."}
{"text":"Order Delivery tonight. First off when I called I was asked if I could please hold ad before I could even answer I was put right on hold. I held on hold four And a half minutes. I placed my order and was told it would be 45 Minutes to an hour before It Would be delivered. No problem I expected that on a Saturday night. The pizza was awesome. So it makes it worth the hold time."}
{"text":"The cheesey bread sticks are great. Wings could be better. Overall I've always been pleased getting the cheesey bread sticks. Great option for those that are not a fan of sauce but love pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!! They have a daily special where u can get a slice for 1.75 which is a killer deal! We always get their boneless wings and xl pizza delivered right to us . Also recommend their cinnamon sticks which are pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pepperoni pizza.  My only complaint about this place is that the pizza has more crust than it should. They could go a little closer to the edge with sauce and toppings. Sometimes you get a piece that is almost all crust."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in this area.  They call it \"chicago style\" but compared to chicago style in other parts of the country I've had (deep pan with sauce on top), I would say no, it' s more typical thick crust average PIzza Hut/Dominoe's style.  Still very tasty, we like the Kona pizza the best.  I thought it would be a typical Hawaiian style but it actually has teriyaki chicken, the only chicken pizza I've ever liked.  I prefer carryout, we eat there when we are out and about and in a hurry, but it's usually noisy and not super-comfortable, booths are weirdly spaced.  We've taken lots of friends there or served it at home and no one has ever not liked it."}
{"text":"Pizza has a lot of oregeno in it. Subs dry and more bread than meat. Dining room is not that clean. Employees are nice. Bathrooms not clean.  Drink station dirty. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I waited an hour for my delivery and I'm so excited to sit down to finally eat and...it's not what I ordered. I called and the girl that answered the phone gave it to the guy who took my order and decided he wanted to let me know it's what I ordered. Actually, it's not what I ordered otherwise I wouldn't have called.  Needless to say they said they would deliver what I ordered. Luckily I love their pizza and have eaten there many times and it's always amazing. Hopefully this was a one time issue and aside from trying to argue with me they're making it right. Four stars   ... It's now been two hours since I ordered the pizza and we're pretty starving. I'm starting to wonder if they're coming. It was a four stars but now I need to drop it to a three  ...seriously, it's so late now and I don't think they're coming. I ended up needing to have a piece of the wrong pizza because I'm starving and now I feel obligated to stay awake just in case....oh never mind they're here. Is it bad that I'm worried they spit in it? They wouldn't do that right?"}
{"text":"Food was very good but forgot to put cheese on the spaghetti as requested:/ it was affordable and fast delivery..sad about the cheese but still tasted good:)"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza joint.  We always order takeout and the pizza is always consistently good and hot."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! No more Dominos or Pizza Hut for me...this is waaay better and I am not going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time we come to AZ we eat their pizza! Wish they had one in LA"}
{"text":"We had just gotten effed over by Dominos, which wasn't where we wanted to go anyway (but we had a free pizza, see my Dominos review), so we went to Barro's.   We went in there and the super friendly girl at the counter tells us it's only going to be about 15 mins max for the order of wings and the pizza we placed. Awesome.  We went across the street to get a Redbox movie while we were waiting.  Go back in and it was packed (we somehow had missed the crowd) and the girl remembers us and gets our order for us and we were out the door in 15 mins flat.  We had ordered a large pineapple & pepperoni pizza and a 12pc order of medium wings.  Everything was delicious! I'm actually very glad that Dominos sucks-a$$ because we went here instead.  I know exactly where I'll be going for pizza next time.   I wanted to take pics, but we were so famished we mowed through the wings and half of the pizza before I realized I should have taken pics. Ooops! Sorry. Next time for sure!  Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"This place was awful , my friend and i went this afternoon and we both got sick , been on the toilet multiple times since we left.. oh and the salad bar most of the veggies were old or over chilled to the point of sogginess... this place was an insult to the other Barro's were their employees might give a shit."}
{"text":"My husband orders pizza from here all the time and while I'm not a huge pizza fan, I really like Barro's pizza. I usually order the anti pasta salad and it's great. They don't skimp on the meat and even the small is good size. The food is good and with good prizes and fast delivery, we will definitely continue ordering"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza. Thin crust was delicious!  The Italian sausage magnificant.  I was in the area so visited the establishment at Dysart and Camleback prior to ordering as wanted to see the state of the resteraunt and staff prior to ordering my takeout later.  Delivery was prompt. Only concern is they can't accept a debit or credit card with a non US billing address so that left us with cash only.  I'll be ordering from here again though."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night and this place was packed! Every table was full and people kept coming in! They opened up the patio so that was nice.   My order consisted of a medium Barros special pizza, (whip is a supreme pizza) 6 wings, and a small drink.   The pizza was ok. It was soggy and it could've been cooked a little longer. Our wings were drenched in buffalo sauce and the sauce had a sour taste. I will definitely consider giving this place another try in the future. When I do, I will make sure to let them know I want my pizza fully cooked and not too much sauce on my wings."}
{"text":"Barros has ben my go to place for a long time! Pizza and wings there are sooo, so good. I generally go for a pepporoni and meatball and they are ubeatable.. Honestly, the wings tho are super expensive and not worth it. Stick with the pizza, cant miss.. The hot wings are awesome (get the hottest they got and you shouldnt be dissapointed)... Just overpricred big time wing wise"}
{"text":"The wings are AWESOME here! Huge sized & definitely worth the price! Me & my family always get the XL pizza & 24 wings special that's $24.99, I believe. Always our first choice for pizza aside from Peter Piper!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good - a bit skimpy on the sausage.  Garlic Bread was less than good (dry and burnt).  Pasta meal (Spagehtti) was ok, nothing great but good.  Overall, I will try again but next time with no garlic bread and thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"I enjoy Chicago type of pizzas, the prices are more than a regular chain pizza place but i think its worth it. The wings are crispy and sausy and the pizzas toppings are not nasty. Do it. It's the best pizza in Anthem"}
{"text":"I got gluten free pizza with no sauce (I have food allergies) and with pepperoni, bacon and mushroom. It was actually really good. Their wings are big and great, especially the sweet red chili sauce."}
{"text":"It's not bad but all we've had is the pizza.  When they first opened, we used the 25% off coupon and the cashier was very friendly and the staff almost as nice.  So we frequent the location when we're in the mood for pizza.  They offer this 25% off coupon all the time, and we use it since we eat out so often.    Went in recently in March (2015) and after we ordered, I handed the coupon over and the girl informs us that Barro's CAN'T TAKE THE COUPONS ANYMORE.  Ok, so we pay and eat.  The next day I see another coupon in the ads and again in yet another new ad.  So what's up with the lie WE CAN'T TAKE THESE COUPONS ANYMORE??  LOUSY attitude, didn't acknowledge us when we walked up and continued to ignore us until she was ready.  Even if there wasn't a coupon offered anymore, WHY LIE about it and REFUSE to honor the coupon?  I'd still eat there but that's the last time we'll spend money for Barro's pizza CAN'T TAKE THESE COUPONS ANYMORE.  See ya."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful pizza!! Meatballs and pasta dishes are out of this world as well! The service is superior!!! Yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this location and they've always come through for me. This is my Favorite pizza, hands down.  Delicious! The toppings are so plentiful, they are literally falling off my slice as I type this. Ingredients are fresh and the delivery is fast, usually a good deal sooner than they'll estimate on the phone. Sometimes the larger chunks of chicken will get a little dry when its cooking (I get the Kona special, yummy!), but that's my only complaint.   Edit: They have changed locations and I have also noticed a slip in service and quality. As of recent, it is inconsistent. I had to call in about my last order, which was not hot enough and semi-dry, but they gave me a credit for next time so I'll keep ordering here and hope this is just an occasional mess up. Also, they discontinued their coupons, Boo =("}
{"text":"I LOVE BARRO'S!!!   Maybe I'm biased because I grew up on this pizza, but it really does hit the spot.  The original pizza is a thicker crust pizza but they also make a thin crust if you prefer (I think both are amazing).  They do tend to be heavy on the sauce, I prefer light sauce but they always accomodate.  Great for a family pizza night :) They also have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Always happy with their food, prices and delivery. Hate to say this but the salad bar does need to be tended to more often. I keep getting brown lettuce. But that's minor to the quality of their pizzas."}
{"text":"Placed a To Go order here. Staff was quick to help. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms, as well as cheesy bread, chicken wings and salad. It was all mediocre. I like pizza that has sensational dough and Cheesy garlic bread that tastes better than pizza. I like wings that are saucy and spicy, and fresh salads that have all the fixings. Nothing stood out, nothing was quite quality but it was a good value for the money. Would I come back? Probably not, I can get better quality pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. I like ranch with my pizza. I asked for ranch and they want to charge 50 cents for ranch. Its a condiment! Who charges for ranch? Absolutely absurd. Never going back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Great Chicago pizza.  Came for lunch.  $4 for two slices n a drink, or $5.75 for three slices n a drink.  Love the pizza here."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas to go, when I arrived they were piping hot.  They gave me a bunch of napkins and powdered cheese/peppers.  Everybody at the house loved the pizza.  Barro's is much better than Pizza Hut but it's also a bit more expensive.  Easy to find location."}
{"text":"Really Barro's? 70 minutes for delivery when I was told 25-30 minutes over the phone? When I called 50 minutes in, I was told he would be there \"any minute now\". Well, the driver showed up 20 minutes later. (I live 10 minutes away.) I wish the girl who answered the phone would have just been honest with me if there had been some sort of delay or issue. You can't be that busy on a Monday evening. I doubt I'll order delivery again."}
{"text":"Alina was very helpful and knowledgeable she cared about what we wanted. She needs a raise!"}
{"text":"YUM! You guys have to come here if you haven't already. LOVE their pizza, LOVE their (meaty and saucy) wings, and they are generous with all portions of the food, including ranch. The counter girls are always friendly, and the food is fast and fresh. Barro's is the besto's."}
{"text":"I grew up eating pizza here and absolutely love it! However, Leah is not very friendly so don't let her rude attitude steer you to order pizza else where. Leah just forgot how to use her manners"}
{"text":"I hate to do it.  I hate to give a negative review to my neighborhood Barro's but this place is an insult to your health, your stomach, and to the very idea of pizza.  Years ago it was passable but with time the Grayhawk Barro's has taken a slide.  I kept hoping it would improve but it has not.  The pizza is greasy, lacking in flavor, and they often mess up the order.  The last pizza we ordered was not only the wrong order but the grease soaked the entire box and was pooling on top of the pizza.  My kids, who ordinarily love pizza, wouldn't eat it and and it was so unappetising that we threw it away.  Sadly, this experience has become all to frequent with this restaurant.  We kept trying to give it yet another chance but it has become consistently horrible."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Open later than most restaurants in Phoenix. Found this place after searching for something open past 8 p.m.  I ordered a small pizza and when it came out I was shocked at how big it was.  Service was fast and the pizza looked and tasted great.  After the waitress brought my pizza, I never saw her again.  I had to go to the counter to request a to go box. It wasn't a bad experience by any means, just wish the waitress at least would've checked to make sure everything was ok.  It was good pizza and I highly recommend it.  It was so good that I took my leftovers on the plane home the next day."}
{"text":"Barro's is one of my favorite pizza franchises so it pains me to only give this location 2 stars.  Don't get me wrong the pizza and wings are good, its the service that has me disappointed.  It seems that each time I order delivery from this location it takes 30 minutes or longer than the quoted time to deliver my order.  Each time it was late I called and all I got was \"its on its way\", \"should be there any minute\"."}
{"text":"We ordered for takeout- the White Pizza and cheesy breadsticks. Both were delicious ! (When we got it home!) The counter service was the best. We were greeted as we entered and the young woman at the counter smiled throughout our visit. I caught her name tag \"Ally\". She is an asset to Barro's!"}
{"text":"If you know what to expect going in, you will not be disappointed. This is right on par with the major chains.  The kind of pizza that is good at the tail end of a case of beer - carbs, low quality cheese, and tomato paste sauce.  I am giving 3 stars instead of two because the wings were pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this location for a very long time. They have a good pizza and wing special. Great place. We order here often."}
{"text":"We've always loved their pizza, in fact it's our favorite in the area. They usually take an exceptionally long time to deliver but this evening they not only took an hour and a half to deliver our ONE pizza and salad, the driver called to tell us that he had delivered our pizza to the wrong address. No apologetic phone call from the manager because he was \"making\" another pizza for us. We weren't offered a discount or anything for their screw up, to top it all off, the lettuce in our salad was wilted and our pizza was a soggy mess."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good. The wings are delicious. I also tried the cheesy bread sticks which I like even more than the pizza. I just moved to the area and have been there numerous times already. I usually pick up and the staff is always friendly. I was even able to get my pizza in 30 minutes on Super Bowl day."}
{"text":"Awesome local pizza that delivers to Vistancia. Try the hot wing chicken pizza! Oh and also the lunch specials are very inexpensive and tasty. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt...got order wrong and this was dine in...glad we didn't just pick it up. ...2 star only because they offered to remake it."}
{"text":"Barros is friggin amazing. Wed and fridays lunch specials are the best. Tuesdays are pretty good too, and sat. The ranch is soooooo good. Imo. This is some the best pizza im town. By far! And the lunch special simply cant be beat!  Anyone that says this is \"bad pizza\" dhould not be eating pizza. If you like thin crust, then go to Ray's--which is also amazing, but dont call it bad pizza just because you dont like thick crust, this bread, tons of cheese, and topped with amazingness."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!! They have great wings, great cheesy bread.  Can't think of something that is mediocre.  Definitely recommending this to friends"}
{"text":"I've been to several different Barro's locations and the great pizza is what makes me come back for more.   We stopped by Friday night and it surprisingly was not busy. We ordered one XL pizza, one salad, an order of mozzarella sticks, two drinks, and an order of 24 boneless wings.   We sat down and waited for our food. The layout of the dining area is pretty big but it's weird. There are tables and booths everywhere and they also have outdoor seating. The dining area where we sat at has carpet and it was really dirty underneath our table.   Our food came out pretty quickly and the employee was friendly. Oh and the guy who rang us up was also very friendly.   The mozzarella sticks were delicious and the salad was fresh. The boneless wings were ok just a little too drenched in sauce. The pizza? This is where I get teary eyed.... what happened?   The pizza was plain ol BLAH. It was definitely not what I remember it tasting like. The pepperonis were scarce and the sauce had no flavor. Yes it was gooey from the cheese but other then that, the pizza had nooooo flavor. I found myself drenching it in ranch, parmesan cheese, and red peppers...   The employees were friendly and there are a bunch of TVs around and. I really enjoyed the the mozzarella sticks and the salad. The ranch is also greaaaaaat!   I did not like the pizza."}
{"text":"I like Barro's Pizza.  They offer really fast service (take out) and good service in restaurant.  Their pizza is a good sturdy kind, lots of crust, plenty of sauce and fresh items.  Not 100% original, but if you like combination or pepperoni and sausage, they do a decent job of it.  Price wise, they are fair market.  You can download a reusable coupon from their website and get a large pizza (any kind of specialty) for $12.99.  This beats the competition, and frankly, is worth the inexpensive dining-in experience.  Good for families and large groups.  Call ahead and typically pick up your pizza on time -- two thumbs up!  Beware of Friday nights during Football season -- the line is very long, and often you have to wait to pick up your pizza.  Oh yes, good hot wings and cheesy bread."}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  It rivals what we get in Portland.  We ordered the Barro's Classic twice...one I took home and another we sat & ate in house.  Nice blend of flavors, crust is thin but I enjoy the puffy edges and they are very good and chewy.  Also enjoyed the Italian beer.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I actually *worked* at this Barro's when I was 16.  That was 18 years ago.  From the current reviews I can see it hasn't changed much, down to the beige plates and 80's rec room decor.  I miss the pizza so so much.  It's chewy and crunchy and cheesy and saucy and perfect."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! have gone back a few times."}
{"text":"A large slice of pizza and a large drink till 4 pm fir $2.50. We eat here at least once a week before my daughter goes to dance across the parking lot. Can't beat feeding us for under $10. Great family place."}
{"text":"Decent inexpensive pizza in my neighborhood. $14.00 for a large pepperoni and they have a pretty tasty dough. Specials are like large 1 topping pizza with 24 wings for $22.00."}
{"text":"Just had a very horrible experience here with placing a delivery order here. Called in to place my order with an Ashley, she asks for my number which I give her two times to confirm and tell her to have the driver call me so I can come down stairs and open the door due to no doorbell at my location I was at. She tells me no problem I will have the driver call. Remind you I am ordering for 6 hungry men that have had a long day to begin with. So one hour goes by and I call to get an ETA on the order and Ashley tells me the driver had been to my location and he was knocking and calling but I must have been to busy to hear my phone or door knocks. I said that's weird I did not miss a call nor am I to busy right now so she said she will call the driver and have him come right back. I then asked her to make sure for the third time she had the right number and confirmed it again with her. I waited another 15 mins and nothing, so I call back a third time, and get a different employee. I tell her what happened and she places me on hold and puts me on with a manager, he tells me the same thing Ashley told me about the driver knocking and calling multiple times and he should be there any second. 10 mins later the driver shows up with me waiting outside at this point so I don't miss him and as soon as he pulls up I say I'm so sorry I didn't hear you knock, then the driver tells me he NEVER knocked he called the number printed on the ticket, I ask him what number it was, and it was a wrong number they printed. So my problem here is the simple fact two people lied to me and told me the driver knocked on my door, and they were confirming my number which they had the right one which they didn't. I am very upset that I was lied to and will never go here again as I go into the restaurant all the time. You just lost my business as well as the 6 other guys I was ordering for. Word of mouth spreads pretty fast."}
{"text":"We've been going to Barro's for years!  Best pizza EVER hands down.  Sausage, mushroom for us, cheese for the kids.  Great service, great location."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two weeks and have had no issues with their service even when there is a significant amount of customers. The food and the beer make this place worth any wait you incur."}
{"text":"I guess I should have taken the time to cook tonight as I decided to splurdge a little and buy a pizza and wings and boom backfire! First we ordered boneless wings and recieved bone in their place. They were slopped in sauce, not sure what happened there. Then super disappointed  with the  Pizza it was full of grease and doughy it was inedible. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"LOVE their salad bar & pizza.  Some other Barro's are too cheap to have a real salad bar like thus one with antipasto meats.  several Barron's I've been too in the East Valley serve a stingy bowl of pre-prepared lettuce which is often wilted with a couple of cucumber slices, a cherry tomatoes or two, and about 20 shreds of cheese...all worth about 25 cents.  Rumor has it that this Barro's is going to follow suit to save money. I would rather pay an extra dollar to keep their salad bar than to see them convert to the stingy tasteless unappetizing rabbit food the other Barron's offer.  I will no longer eat at this Barron's once they omit its wonderful self-serve antipasto salad bar."}
{"text":"Part Two to my previous review of this joint.  This particular store of Barry's remain we a major disappointment  one year after my previous visit.  I mentioned that the salad was pre-med with brown lettuce a very spongy  (soggy) croutons.  This restaurant is too cheap to have an actual salad bar like other Barro's.  Huge let down!!!  Quality of value of the salad was as poor as one can get.  After I returned my salad for a fresh salad, I asked for pepper and parmesan cheese..  The cashier tilts her head and said, \"Over there.\". I looked where her head had pointed to only to see nothing but an empty counter.  When she returned, I told her that nothing is where her head had pointed.  She said, \"On!  You'll have to walk around the restaurant to look for them.  One would like to  think that each table would at lease contain the parmesan, salt, pepper, red peppers, & napkins on each table  like the others."}
{"text":"I've been eating Barros Pizza for 25 years now and I wanted to make sure I did my part to show my support. I've never had a bad experience with any location I've ordered from. The pizza is always hot, fresh, and amazing! Thank you so much for providing such amazing food and service for all these years!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a medium pizza and wings to be delivered 1.5 miles to our home. The lady was polite and said your delivery time will be 45 minutes to one hour. After an hour and 15 minutes I called to ask about the new expected delivery time and the lady said the pizza was on its way. After another 15 minutes I called to check again and the lady was impolite and stated the delivery time had been delayed to 1.5 hours, the current time (would have been nice to know when I ordered the pizza). None-the-less the pizza was delivered an hour and forty minutes after it was ordered. The pizza was not hot/fresh. I won't be ordering here again! Very disappointing cause the Mesa, AZ Barros was great."}
{"text":"Consistency is key, and Barro's is hit or miss as a pizza joint, but I order it regularly for one reason: when it hits it is the best local pizza chain in the valley. When it misses? Oh boy. A few weeks back I had an OUTSTANDING pizza and wings that was worth every penny, tonight I ordered a sausage and onion pizza that was almost a joke. 2-3 average to small pieces of sausage per slice, and the pie was so undercooked it was incredible. The cheese was white, as in NO browning or golden rings at all, and you could still see the outline of the individual strands of cheese clumping together. Same for the onion, still clear and not browned at all. What's worse than super white cheese? White dough. The crust was white and almost chewy inside. You don't have to work at a pizza place to know that brown and gold means done not white. If you got it together Barro's, I'd order more often. Instead I'm left knowing I have a 50/50 shot on an epic pie or an instant regret, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Excellent! We just moved out to Higley & Queen Creek and found this place 2 months ago when trying to find a place to deliver.  We took a chance and even though our first delivery was delayed as the driver was lost the food was great! We now order every week.  Super friendly, quick deliver, excellent pizza - good price, great quality.  No need for us to look any further."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza. We love the Barros Special and have it delivered when we come here. Delivery service is always prompt and the pizza is hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"We live nearby, so we decided to try their pizza. Overall, it was just okay. The toppings we're minimal and the crust was doughy."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings for the money. Crust is on the medium thickness side which i really like, sauce is tasty and they are generous with the cheese and toppings.  Wings are large and the sauces are good (Especially the Honey Hot and Sweet Chile). Ranch and blue cheese are good as well.  If dining in they have good prices on beer as well."}
{"text":"My family always enjoys themselves here. Service is great, food is fantastic, and beer is cold. I am baffled by the bad reviews about this location. We've been coming every Friday since we moved here four months  and never had an issue."}
{"text":"Always an awesome experience ordering from this location.  Excellent food, prompt and helpful service but most of all the manager Todd is awesome!"}
{"text":"Always awesome service and excellent food.  Two thumbs up to management and the rest of the team.  Ashley helped me out tonight and she was incredibly pleasant, but then again everyone always is.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the quality and the helpfulness Anna F. gave. We ordered the Barro's special no mushrooms- I'm allergic- she made sure the chef knew NO Mushroom's and told us the if we want the crust a little more crunchy order extra done.  The staff was friendly and pleasant and the food when we got it home was exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"I frequent this Barro's almost once a week....yes I have a pizza addiction!  The pizza is always good and the wait staff is exceptional.  I normally call in my pizza order and then pick it up on the way home.  When I call they always know me by name and recognize that I'm a regular.  I rotate between three different pizza favors, BBQ Chicken (my favorite), Pepperoni/Sausage/Mushroom, and just a Cheese Pizza.  The pizza is consistently good.  The counter staff is always friendly and efficient.  You can tell this Barro's is very well managed.  I've never actually eaten in, so not sure about that experience.  The dining area is small and doesn't look appealing to me."}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience here! I generally go for the lunch special - face service and everyone is enthusiastic and kind! Our school orders from them from time to time as well and the pizza has always been delicious! Great value as well!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place around, we have eaten here several times, never had a bad experience. We've tried the pasta, subs, pizza, and wings love it all."}
{"text":"We like to grab pizza from here because they make them extra cheesy and they take pride in their pizza. We have never been disappointed in the service. They even have an area in the back that kids can kind of let loose. :-) The employees are helpful and don't mind our kiddo making a mess. (Sorry Barros) We will continue to come back for pizza and beer ;-)"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down. I only have 2 pizza joints in Mesa that I love and this is one of them! The staff at this location is amazing and they're always on top of their game. They also have some of the best wings out there. If you need a new pizza place to call home check this place out!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, I just ordered one last night and it was the bomb and it got to my house super fast as well! I don't often order from any other pizza place because barros is very worthy of being my favorite. Sometimes I have gotten a bit too much cheese on the pizza, but overall I highly recommend them. On a last note go to their lunch specials because they are cheap and you can get slices of pizzas, salads, and drinks for awesome prices 4-6$ if I remember correctly since they have different specials!"}
{"text":"Had pizza & wings delivered. The wings portion was great and they stayed hot for a long time after delivery.  We ordered bbq and a pepperoni pizza. The Bbq was very good. Barros crust, cheese. And sauce blend does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Driving down Borderline Road, looking for something to eat, went pass this place and was tempted, after going another two miles or so we made a U-Turn (Not sure if it was legal or not) so ended up here and we're very glade we decided on this place, the whole pizza is VERY good! (even at the crust part-which sometimes I don't) and I would come back here the next time we are in the Tempe area!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Very thick crust. Even the thin crust is more like normal crust. I recommend sausage + salami + meatballs + garlic on thin crust."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Not much variety for alcoholic beverages other than some beer, but that's okay. First time I have eaten in rather than taken it to go - much better this way! Needs to label on the fountain drink machine which is water and which is soda water - I had a big surprise, lol!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and nice little salad bar. Bring a fly swatter if you plan on eating in the restaurant...next time we'll take it to go so we can skip the obnoxious battle with the flies."}
{"text":"Prices continue to go up. Now they're charging more for bone in wings than boneless. Normally it the other way around. Pizza is great as are the pastas and sandwiches but charging me more for wings is pushing me to go across the street to get a lower quality pizza but way better wings and cheaper wings. I know a lot of it has to die with minimum wage increasing but there's no reason to increase the cost on traditional wings, unless they're getting a substandard boneless with a lot of fillers and byproduct."}
{"text":"Good local pizza place in Cave Creek. We took out, but they had a nice eat-in area. Pizzas are delish. Crust excellent. No skimping on the sauce and cheese. We had a meat lovers (an artery clogging delight), Haiwian (yummy), and a thin crust BBQ chicken (tangy). Can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"I'm From Upstate New York,  Love a good Pizza Pie and this is without a doubt one of the Best overall traditional Pizzas in Arizona - period!   Brought my family there when they were young and now I bring my Grandson"}
{"text":"There is pizza and then there is Barros.   I've been to NY, Chicago and still love Barros the most. Crust is just unreal, toppings are amazing & no shortage of cheese. Mega meat & chicken supreme are our favorites but never had a bad one...  Pizza is incredible but so are the breadsticks with cheese. Make sure to get 10 ranches as well, definitely our go to pizza."}
{"text":"really wasn't that great I had to add and oregano to give the pizza any flavor. Maybe It just was on an off day"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good pizza parlor, and now found one. Ordered take out pizza was ready on time. Next  time will bring friends and dine in. Was a very friendly place and liked the atmosphere. Keep up the great work and will see you when I need my fix."}
{"text":"Great food. We go about twice a month and are starting to notice that they have about a 2 1/2 to 3 inches of crust on the pizza.  Which means less cheese and pepperoni on the pizza. Did not notice that in the beginning."}
{"text":"This is really good pizza. Super hot and fresh. The sizes are huge too. We got their barros special extra large and a single topping pizza with bacon. And an order of cheesy bread with marinara. There is definitely going to be pizza taken home for mid night snacking.   Oh and dont forget the brewski sizes beers."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings my family loved it. They even bring your pizza and wings to your table. Even asked us how everything was."}
{"text":"This Barro's location has been a regular, Friday night outing for our family, for several years.  But, I'm not sure I'm going to be going to this location, in the future.  The employees are great, and I can't ever remember not getting great customer service, but lately the wings have been coming to the table, cold and to steal aquote from Peyton T., the Fresh Sewer Smell has been a little over the top.  This has been going on for months and they have attempted to aleviate the problem by using industrial deodorant, to the point of it wafting out to the eating area and making your food taste, just like it.  I've mentioned this to the management, but they just seem to want to put a bandaid over the problem.  I love supporting business's that are close to my house, but I'll probably start going to the location, near Moon Valley."}
{"text":"Great food. Pizza is delicious. The staff is great at making you feel welcome. Jarred helped us and was very friendly. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"The best pizza at a great price. Seriously the best place for lunch. I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to the pizza here. Today was my first time eating there & I can't believe how good the pizza is. I think I paid under $3 for a slice & a drink which is the perfect size lunch. $3 is a deal. The staff was friendly and super fast. I'm probably going to be there everyday for lunch from now on."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza and a decent beer selection and friendly staff. The regular crust tends to be too much for me but the thin crust is just right. The cookie pizza with vanilla ice cream is great for when I'm feeling a bit indulgent."}
{"text":"I've given this place a 3rd shot now and like good science, it's replicable. I've used them for delivery of pepperoni, mushroom and black olive.   The ordering process was fast and simple, the promised delivery time was on-time each time we ordered, and the pizza itself was excellent. Unlike the national brands, it actually had flavor and rather than being dry, it was nice and juicy. Prior to the last 6 months, I hadn't had a Barro's pizza since 1983 when I lived in Anaheim, CA and they were one of the only ones nearby.   The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, was because I have had two better pizzas in my life, both were from old, family run full-service Italian restaurants. Kudos to you....keep up the effort."}
{"text":"Left my table to use the restroom and take a call, but when I returned my table was cleared off and with it more than half my pizza & wings. The employee that cleared the table did apologize, but offered zero resolution to the fact that more than half my food was thrown away. I love Barro's pizza, but won't be coming back after that. Yes, it was a mistake, but the fact that they just tossed half my meal is extremely upsetting. I left to use the bathroom, not vacuum my car at the nearest car wash. Damn, I was really enjoying it all too. There was a baseball game on TV and the crust was perfect on the pizza.   (The angry face is from my stomach. The sad face is from my heart)"}
{"text":"The worst pizza place on the west coast of america, well I take that back the worst in the WORLD! it is ran by kids and they have no management."}
{"text":"Never had bad service or a bad slice. The staff is always on top of it and the nicest people. Great place for a beer and really good pizza. Crust is amazing for all you carb lovers."}
{"text":"We love this place we get delivery often! Pizza is always yummy! Always on time and the orders always right!!! I've never set down to eat but they have never let me down in the delivery department!!! Thanks for always yummy pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this location gets even 2 stars is that the pizza is good as always. However this is the worst location I've ever eaten at. Just about every empty table is filthy. The two lunch pizzas we wanted where gone and they said are already making more and it would only be 6 minutes. So 15 minutes later nothing and when I go to check they have them and appears they probably been handing out the new pizzas faster to new customers than to the ones who already paid. They don't seem to have a good system to make sure the first slices of a new pie go to customers who already paid and are waiting.  Avoid this location when they are busy they don't seem to be able to handle it well."}
{"text":"So impressed right now... Cannot wait to dig into this sausage onion pie and Honey BBQ & Honey Hot wings - they even give you celery and ranch"}
{"text":"we ordered cheese pizza slices and salads. My daughter brought our slices to the table while the salads had to be made. I wasn't impressed with the sight of the pizza to begin with since I could tell they were not very fresh or warm. While waiting for the salads they brought out a piping hot cheese pizza. I was bummed that I got the crappy old pizza slices while the guy right behind me got the fresh hot slice. I even said something to the gal about being bummed about it and she just laughed. No thanks Barros. Old pizza is crap pizza."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, especially for the price I paid $47 for two medium three topping pizzas.  The customer service was great and the delivery was fast. So I will definitely be ordering again, overall happy I'm with the service."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials. crust is a little thick for my taste though. Quality  of ingredients is top notch ans they off a decent salad bar for the more health minded among us."}
{"text":"When I travel to Tempe I always stop in for a pie. The new location is great! Ample seating which can accommodate large parties!   The pizza is always fresh and the crust is fantastic! We usually keep it simple and grab a large pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. If you are looking for a great local pizza joint you won't be disappointed.   I've heard the wings are great but we haven't tried them yet. Maybe that's what we should have for dinner :-) ..."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I love Barro's pizza. I've always loved it (Hawaiian is my favorite!) and I'd eat if every day if I could. But I can't.   Why?  Well besides the fact I'm trying to lower my carb and gluten intake and I'd probably gain 20 lbs if I ate it every day, this location is posted as a gun free zone.  It is unfortunate that companies think it's smart to take away their customer's rights while in their establishment, stripping them of the ability to protect themselves from the law breakers that will ignore the sign anyway.  So I notified the manager with a \"No guns = no money\" business card and have not returned.  Take the sign down and I will eat there often as it's very close to my office.  But until then, they will get none of my money.  I gave it 3 stars, 5 stars for the food, 1 star for the fact that I can't enter the building to actually buy any of it."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! Excellent  pizza reasonable price,I highly recommend.Very good food , Friendly service."}
{"text":"So disappointed.....  This location is the one closest to our house and it USED to be pretty decent. Lately, however, it is been kind of lackluster.  We ordered 2 small salads and 12 wings.  There was hardly any lettuce in the bins, and what was there was frozen. The other options were ok, but the whole bar was a disaster. But, eh, it happens...although the lettuce should always be restocked. This is the second time this exact scenario has happened.  Also, the wings......we ordered 12 and got 11. We were told 10 minutes and it was actually 25. This is also the second time this has happened.   I am forgiving gal, but I am not sure I will be back.   Also, why are there always several dirty tables every time I come in....on top of that there was a Wetzel's pretzels napkin on the floor the whole time I was there, kinda weird."}
{"text":"This Barro's location is very hit or miss. We have had great pizza from here and we have also had seriously underdone pizza (wet doughy crust) and once they put anchovies all over the pizza although I had not ordered it, nor said anything even close to \"anchovies\". The underdone pizza was delivery, and when we called to complain, they re-delivered another one. With the anchovy mistake, I had picked it up. I had to drive back to the store to get my remade pizza. When my husband had called, he was told that the manager would give us something extra for our inconvenience. When I arrived, the young woman behind the counter almost gave me the wrong pizza, and the manager never even came out to apologize, let alone comp us anything.   Now, having worked in the restaurant industry, neither my husband nor I are asshats who make a scene and demand things for free. But when the promise is made, and there's no delivery...  I NEVER had a single issue when I got our Barro's in North Phoenix on my way home from work. We were excited to have a branch nearer to us, but my confidence in this location is seriously shaken."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. I haven't tried their dine in experience yet. I've ordered pick up only. Every time  I call an order in, I get a friendly smile and the correct delicious pizza upon walking through the door. Love the thicker dough the make and they certainly \"cheese it up\". I tried their wings last time and the wings did not impress. Maybe I got a bad batch, but they were dried out like they had sat for a while and got reheated. I'll try some other items next time I go for sure, salads, pasta."}
{"text":"Not very good service asked for one thin crust and one thick crust and received both thin crust  and the delivery man was very rude about it will not bring my buisness there again."}
{"text":"This crew on estrella parkway, were kickass! We came in with a large group at dinner rush, 15 people.  After we were turned away from another pizza spot cause they wouldn't accommodate our large party.we will visit again!"}
{"text":"Pizza was reasonably priced and okay tasting.  It is nice to try somewhere exclusive to AZ.  The restaurant itself is nothing to look at but I'd likely go here again."}
{"text":"I am not big on Pizza but this place is definitely a winner!!!! The best Pizza place in Anthem!!!  I love the selection and the food tastes oh so fresh. From the pizza to the ravioli. The pizza is good, the pasta is good, the bread is good, and the chicken wings are also... you guessed it. GOOD!  Their delivery is quick and the people are nice. Prices are good for the quality of the food you get and I'd rather spend money at Barro's than waste it on Pizza Hut or Dominos any day.  Their meat pizza is really good and the italian sausage they put on the pizza sare these huge chunks of italian yumminess.  The chicken pizza is good too and I love how much green peppers and onions they put on it. It gives it a crunch and makes it taste very fresh.   Chicken wings have good flavor and HOT means hot... I even like the honey hot flavor which is not something I usually get.   The spagehtti comes with this giant meat ball that is cut in half. The meat tastes soooo good. Like it is home made. Ravioli has good flavor too but I am not a big pasta fan so I usually eat the meat ball and  move onto the pizza or wings.  The garlic bread that comes with the pizza.... SOOO GOOD! We always order extra because I will not share... hahahaha"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special and there was nothing special about it. They were out of the pizza I wanted and would not make more. They also stop making pizza for the lunch specials at 2:30pm. So, pizza isn't fresh after 2:30."}
{"text":"Was visiting family in Avondale & was referred by my brother in law to try the pizza & i must say that it is one of the best pizza's I've tried by far. The sauce & toppings were amazing along with the wings. The price was good as well for the amount of food we ordered & definitely plan to go eat there again next time I visit."}
{"text":"I previously compared Barros to Le Grand Orange and Pizzaria Bianco. I was wrong. Barros isn't even in the same league or even ballpark as LGO, Bianco or even Cibo!!   Like I said though, I like Barros. It's a great everyday pizza. Kinda like a nice middle of the road bottle of wine. But LGO and Cibo are hand-tossed, fire-oven baked, thin, crispy yet chewy NYC yumminess!    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This use to be our favorite place. Service wasn't so great yesterday for my family outing. We ordered. Went and sat down. Two of the three salads came out. Waited. Pizza came out. No 3rd salad. Went and asked for my salad and she went to \"check on it\". Minutes later my salad came. Family had already began eating. Husband returned his Caesar salad. He was disappointed in it's creation.... We were missing two wing sauce side orders. Daughter went and got those. Manager came out apologized. Didn't offer to remove salad off the bill. Later during the meal husband went and spoke with them. They refunded his money.  We had them come to our table with mozzarella sticks.. wrong table. Maybe 10 minutes later we had a server try and deliver 24 wings to our table... Again wrong table. Then another basket... Of something.  For as much money as we spent for salads, wings, and pizza... Service and organization of staff was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst Barron's I have ever been to and I love their pizza. The one in Laveen on baseline and 51st is terrible they will never get my money again."}
{"text":"2-3 Stars-- We visit this location often. Their GF pizza is not good and very expensive. I would not recommend the Gluten Free pizza. However, their regular pizzas are pretty good. Not our ideal pizza, not our favorite pizza but it's good enough for when on the run. The kids really like it.   Ps- I do wish the location was a bit cleaner. It seems to be run by teenagers."}
{"text":"I went to this location on New year's day weekend, I ordered the large Vegetarian Special with a 24 pieces spicy BBQ. The food was great, no complains about the food or the service, great environment overall."}
{"text":"My sister and I moved to Surprise a few months ago and were having a hard time finding a good pizza but then we tried Barros. The first time we just had a plain cheese pizza and it was excellent then last night we ordered the white pie and it was beyond fabulous.  We also ordered the antipasta which was fresh and loaded with meat ,cheese and fresh vegetables. Everyone there is friendly, the prices are excellent, the pizza was delivered in half an hour and we now have a favorite pizza and pizza place."}
{"text":"this location just keeps improving!!! every time I go in there there are new perks! Today I went in and they had replaced their menu with tvs! much easier to read for me! The food is amazing and my wings were a favorite. Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"keep in mind, i'm only rating this pizza in relation to fast food style, delivery pizza - i wouldn't even put them in the same category as Slices or Tesio's.  that being said, when i want greasy food deliverd to my door, i've always been a pizza hut fan - you know, if you're going gross, do it right, don't you think? and for years i lived with girls who were die hard barro's orderers. i didnt really mind because it seemed all the same to me anyway.   but, i just had barro's for the first time in probably a year and a half and that was some good damn pizza. they're ingredients are much better quality, you don't need several napkins to sop up the grease, their crust is better and their consistency kills it (the last tiem i ordered the Hut, i got no cheese, wrong crust and piles of burnt pepporoni -like did a person really take that out of the oven, put it into a box and think someone else would want to eat it?).  so, my faith in better-than-average delivery pizza has been restored, by Barro's. my hang over thanks you."}
{"text":"They use a hand shredded fresh mozzarella cheese that they prepare daily along with house mixed Hidden Valley ranch dressing,  and shelf ripened tomatoes for the salads.  The review can end right here with 5 stars as far as I'm concerned.  They also deliver at awesome prices."}
{"text":"Loved Barros old recipe. Sauce and crust is different. Staff very nice every time. Just so much crust."}
{"text":"Barro's was our go to pizza place. It was always delicious. We got many delicious kinds of pizza from there. I loved all the ingredients and the batbecue pizza was my favorite. Always great fresh and sometimes just as good or even better the next day."}
{"text":"Love the location, great environment, friendly gals Perfect menu, get it how you want it, made to order   fresh, hot. And cheesay"}
{"text":"PIzza was great along with the cheese sticks. Just the kind of pizza we try to make at home. Fresh ingredients and great crust. This one delivers to the Arizona Grand Hotel too!"}
{"text":"Wow... ordered a half n half pizza chicken supreme n bbq chicken. I was amazed at the loads of veg toppings huge chunks of chicken too. I will order this again if I am in the area. Great local business."}
{"text":"So Barro's inside...awesome! Pizza fresh out of the oven...pretty awesome as well. (They have a gluten-free option too, didn't know that). But the interior has sold me and I've been probably a dozen times with the kiddos. My daughter simply knows it as \"the pizza place\". They have a cool little play area for kids with an activity table, toys, and a couple smaller tables for them to eat if they'd like. They do have Nick blaring on the big screen TV (which plays Spongebob more than any of us care for) but other than that, the play area sold me.  There are plenty of TVs all over the place too, so catching some sports is never a problem, either. Pizza...still really good although not amazing...great value though. Chicken Strips are more like chicken nuggets, and they give you a few packs of ketchup and a bag of chips...soooo...ehh. Wings are decent at the place. Teeny weeny bit fatty (but enough to make em flavorful). Oh and PS...Shock Top on Draft. si.   All in all...I give them an A-. Awesome atmosphere, great setup...just minor details that would make it amazing. Given the fact I've never seen the actual place at even 60% full...I see why the focus is on their delivery and pies. Great Job Barros in the Tukes!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza, salad bad and bread sticks and it's very reasonably priced and tons left over. The salad bar was good and clean. The bread sticks were the best I've ever had hands down. The pizza was was good but I've had better. The cashier was super friendly and everyone working seemed happy and nice. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Everything a pizza parlor should be. Great pizza and wings, sports on the tele and clean, comfortable surroundings. Barro's is our #1 favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"So first of all, they stop taking delivery orders at 5 PM every night. FIVE PEE EM. Ridic. I begrudgingly went in to pick up my order instead and when I asked the very nice teen girl behind the counter what backwards reasoning was behind this managerial decision, she said the owner had tried to make a delivery once & he got lost for two hours in the dark. Rather than invest in GPS, which he insists is wrong in Cave Creek (I've lived here for 3 years and never had a problem with my GPS, weird) he gives up a crapload of money in business because he won't deliver at night. So I get home with this pizza and frankly it was gross. The whole purpose behind thin crust is that it's crunchy. This was a soggy mess from edge to edge. Nasty. I would have given this one star but I threw in an extra for the nice girl behind the counter."}
{"text":"UPDATE!!!!  I was contacted to discuss my review.  Sent a detailed account to them and nothing!!!!!!!!!! agree with other reviewer.  The food is good but management does not care to fix problems.  The manager Mike needs some people skills training.  They definitely lost our entire family's business solely because if mike.  We are shocked how little our business meant to.him."}
{"text":"Wings and service were horrible. Make the trip to Litchfield Park for better food and service."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and love the prices!  Can't ask for more. Never eaten at the restaurant but it looks cozy and somewhere I wouldn't mind dining in."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in the far west area. Staff is is ways friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Being from NY, eating pizza elsewhere is mostly a brutal experience.  For Arizona, Barro's is above average, but that leaves plenty of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Will never go back. Went there with car club, which usually goes there every Saturday and received the slowest service. 40 MINUTES to get a sandwich. Manager told us \"there were other restaurants to go to.\" when complaints were made. Did give money back when complained. Manager wasn't even on the floor. It wasn't even that busy. Poor management at its worst!"}
{"text":"This place is run by teenage girls who like to be rude because they don't care about their jobs. Cool, I'm impressed!  The pizza is great though."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years now.  I have been to other locations but for some reasons I think the pizza tastes better at this one.  I swear the slices are a little bigger.  They have a good service and I will continue to go to this location."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Barro's for decades. Pizza is great. Its more of a california style pizza but not the foo-fu cali style. Great crust with lots of tasty toppings. Nice to have some variety from the NY or Chicago style pizza around here. Wings.....not the best but better than most for baked wings. Price is fantastic and they deliver really fast when its not at some crazy peak time or something. One of my favorite pizza places ever."}
{"text":"Top of the line pizza it was by far the best pizza I've had in some time. The other reason why they get 5 stars is that I ordered online and must have miss clicked and didn't get it for delivery. So I called let them know what happen and got the pick up changed to delivery hands down thank you. Thank you for the speedy delivery also it took way less time than what the quoted me for. Good Job team !"}
{"text":"BEST*BEST*BEST pizza I have ever had in my life!!!!!!  The crust is so good, you could just eat crust and be happy!  Amazing actually.   I was blown away!! OHHHHHH MG, they are sooooooo nice here!!!!!!!! Excellent service and VERY reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a reasonable price. The staff was very nice as well. You can't beat 4.75 for pizza and unlimited drinks."}
{"text":"This was tasty pizza.  I hadn't visited before, so I went with the cashier's recommendation of the Barro's Special pizza.  It was tasty, but next time I would prefer less cheese and more veggies, so I will order my own.  Had I read earlier reviews carefully, I would have known about the cheese abundance.  No stars off for this - it's just a note about how they make their pizza and how I prefer mine.  We had the original crust - it had a good texture and taste, as did the sauce. A salad bar is available.  They have a back room that was configured for a larger group at a central table (booths remained along the walls) when I was there.  The majority of people sat in a front room."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the other Barros locations that I've been to in the valley, if probably NEVER go to a Barros ever again. This location hands down the WORST for a Saturday evening sit down with the family. Deserves negative stars. Manager on staff not helpful not apologetic for the fact that there are 8 families around me that have no food and have waited just as long as me for their food. It's been 45 mins and not even appetizers. If I called in an order 20 mins ago for pick up I'd probably have eaten my dinner by now. Horrible service and slow production by the kitchen."}
{"text":"Barro's has the best pizza. This is the second location I've been to, and their pizza is on point. They have some really great weekday lunch specials where you can get a couple of slices and a drink for less than $5, but I usually come here to pick up whole pizzas after work.   The BEST kind I've had is the Mega Meat (which is topped with pepperoni, bacon, ham, Italian sausage, and meatballs). You can definitely tell that it's not the most healthy option, but it is amazing. Their regular pepperoni pizzas are also a tasty and less heavy choice. I've had the wings here before too, which are pretty good, but the pizza is definitely the main star.  Also, Barro's doesn't offer table service, so you need to go up to the counter to order (not sure how that's not obvious when you see everyone else standing in line at the counter). They'll drop off the food to your table once it's done. :)"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza! We have never been to a Barro's pizza and we moved close to this location.   We went in and the girl working, I think her name was Jen maybe, told me all their specials and helped me decide.   The customer service here was great from every employee we talked to.  Then we got our pizza. We did a walk in order and it only took about 10 minutes to get it on a Friday afternoon.   Our pizza was so delicious! Thick crust, really tasty sauce and it was so fresh!  Great place!! Way better than chain pizza places and worth the extra money."}
{"text":"This place is so good is you like pizza and you haven't tried barros you're an idiot.   Everyday they have pizza by the slice for lunch special.  The white pizza is amazing, the supreme pizza is amazing and also their Hot wings are so hot I was hurting for a day.   I like eating there but the booths are so sagged in it's insane haha  It's like there's 600 pound people sitting in the booths.   Get the White Pizza and thank me later"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good. The best thing though I think is the prices, which probably makes the pizza taste better! I'm here just about once a week and get a large slice with a drink for $2.49-can't beat that! Pizza everything has been excellent. I normally eat in-that's prob the only area to not write home about. But there sports on TV so who really cares???"}
{"text":"I'm amazed at the reviews for this place. Just had a pizza delivered to my house from them and was confident it would be decent based on the reviews.  Pizza was very greasy and a notch below Domino's. If you enjoy pizza look elsewhere.  Grimaldi's and Spinato's are much better...as in, they should't even be compared to this place."}
{"text":"I came in just to have a small lunch after a busy morning. I didn't want a lot of food so I ordered two slices of cheese pizza. While one of the employees was getting the pizza from the hot box one of the slices ripped and she gave be both slices. She gave me 3 total which made up for the ripped but still edible pizza. I come here occasionally because it is close. Not my favorite pizza, but when Im in the mood for barros I'll always visit here for the friendly staff and good pizza."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza that I've had but it's the best I've had in Arizona.  The delivery times are usually 45 minutes and the drivers are always nice.  We usually order the pepperoni pizza with light sauce and medium wings.  We've also tried the subs which were pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered Barros tonight and after an hour got my pizza cold and the wings I ordered were not there the driver said he could go back and get them and be back in 15 min so I tipped him and agreed it's now been 40 min and he hasn't returned! Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Saw another roach in this place.  Do they not clean up good enough that now the last two times, a roach has been in tbe main walkway. I hope they aren't in the food, too.  Lost my appetite.  Maybe the exterminator/ pest service needs to be called more often.  And maybe the health inspector isn't catching what they ought to be.    Both times I told the gal at the register and the response is, \"oh, that's not good.\"  They said they'd tell the manager, but it doesn't seem to be doing much.   Don't think I want to return."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service!! Chicken wings are to die for!! And with a quick and speedy delivery this is my family's go to pizza and wings place.  Just wish they had better specials, it can get a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Ordered a large quantity of wings, cooked exact opposite of how we ordered them, chewy and not crispy, and bone dry and missing sauce. They offered to remake the order but it was super bowl Sunday and our party was already underway. Bad attitudes by every employee spoken to, as well as the delivery guy that dropped off the missing wing sauce.  we already switched pizza places from Barro's now we have to switch wing places too."}
{"text":"Close, convenient, local, and filled with memories from high school. Plus it's nice to have pizza that's not from a huge national company every once in awhile. :)"}
{"text":"Mannn listen! I've officially kicked DOMINOS to the curb, and I have a free med pizza left! My goodness their reg cheese pizza is soo delectable, so well prepared and seasoned- it reminds me of a NY Pizza slice, the small storefronts near the train station lmao. And this wasn't my order, I stole a piece from my wife cause it looked so good and I wasn't disappointed. Wow!  I ordered the Club Sandwich and the bread was fresh, sweet, moist and chewy, like a good sub should be. I liked the way they stacked the meats and cheese. It made for a well rounded bite where you got everything in every bite, all the way to the bottom. Just unbelievable.  We're moving to Buckhead, Atlanta Ga this year, and I sure as hell hope there's one near us. You Guys Rock Out!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza place in anthem. They have good deals on lunch. $5 for 2 slices and a drink great deal and great pizza"}
{"text":"Yes we can probably be there around every day if you we could I love it I go there all the time with my friends"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Barros Pizza, for going on 16 years now and in that time I have yet to have had a negative experience. I started going there when they opened one by my high school. The pizza is great, the wings are some of the best around and they have a great lunch special. I highly recommend Barros to anyone looking for a great pizza and or some wings."}
{"text":"Ordered the thin crust and it was soggy! Was so disappointed. The toppings were great but crust was un-eatable! Please work on making a crispy non greasy crust for your thin crust pizza. What we got was just a disgrace."}
{"text":"Every time my family and I have ordered from here it has been delivered fast and hot. We usually always order the teriyaki chicken pizza because it is our favorite, we love the sauce. The crust is fluffy and delicious. We have not been disappointed yet. This is our go to pizza place especially because of the price and flavor, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it took 55min. Didn't even tell me the wait time was before I even paid. After I paid I had no choice but to wait 55 damn min. RIDICULOUS! Girl on the phone had major attitude! Was about to go over there knock that attitude out of her !"}
{"text":"I had to give it one star because the bad service and saggy bread meatballs sandwich I received. I would not go there again!"}
{"text":"If you are a lover of pizza as much I am, you have got to try this place! Also, I'm not a huge fan of wings but theirs are to die for! They always come out super fresh and so finger lickin good! :)"}
{"text":"I love Barros pizza but this one has disappointed me both times I have ordered from this location. The pizza is unbelievably greasy. I thought I would give them a second chance but it was just as greasy as the first."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Stopped by for lunch, got their pizza and salad special. Got a slice of cheese along with the side salad. Super sucked that my cheese pizza was semi cold and not cheesy at all, like it would be at my other Barros locations. My fork for the salad that they gave me was dirty, gross!!!! To top it off I just went to the location on Ray Rd and 44th st and that one has their lunch specials cheaper then this place and that slice of pizza at the Ray rd location was heaven. Won't be stopping here again."}
{"text":"We've ordered from different Barro's locations and haven't been disappointed or resolved when something was wrong. We ordered a white pizza as described on their website. Received in so much grease (see photos of pizza and paper towels). So gross. Called to ask for the correct pizza and alert them to the grease, lack of correct topping, and PILES of garlic. Manager said that's not how their white pizza is made. So we read the ingredients to him from their website and he said he couldn't make that pizza because he doesn't carry those ingredients. My friend asked to be refunded and he said she'd have to take a credit or more pizzas. She persisted and he said that she'd have to come pick the money up (that's what we want to do after we were expecting delivered dinner). Finally she compromised and manager said that he would make another pizza personally and refund one pizza. Won't order from there again."}
{"text":"I mainly get food from this place out of convenience, but I'm to the point where I don't feel it's worth it anymore.   I order a thin crust , which was tolerable, but lacking in sauce. The last two times I've ordered, I received the regular crust. I specifically asked for extra sauce on the pizza, and that it be cooked well done. There wasn't any extra sauce nor was it cooked to well done.    One thing that has always bothered me about this location is how the sides are prepared well ahead of the pizza being done, and they sit in a styrofoam box for more than ten minutes. I have asked multiple times for the sides to come out at the same time as the pizza, but they haven't followed through with that.    The wings are sub-par in my opinion, and we stopped ordering wings from them months ago.   Based on my recent experiences at Barro's I can't see myself ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"They changed their sauce recipe and it's even better with the added spices.  One negative is sometimes when I call in an order I get a \"disconnected number\" message. Call back five minutes later and it goees right through."}
{"text":"YES great semi-local pizza spot...good real pizza, sandwiches are good, wings are outstanding, gluten-free options, great service, and fast delivery."}
{"text":"A little disappointed to find two hairs in our pizza and bring it to attention to the front counter.  It must've been the \"What do you want me to do about?\" that I received. Seriously. That is what was said to me.  Our pizza was also not fully cooked. But I am giving up and going home."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for pizza that's a step up from Costco and Pizza Hut, Barro's is definitely my go-to. I've only had their regular pepperoni pizza and their wings, and I have yet to be disappointed with the food. The sauce is delicious and the pizza has always been cooked to perfection. They can definitely get pretty busy, though, so if you're placing a to-go order on one of their busier nights, you might need to wait an extra 10-15 minutes on top of the estimated time that they give you when you place your order online or over the phone.   This place can also get super packed with kids since they have a game room in the back, so if you don't want to hear a bunch of screaming and yelling, you should probably get your food to go like me.  Their medium pepperoni pizza runs for about $10 and feeds two people. Definitely a safe bet!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't order pizza from Barros because of the reviews I read on here. I have always liked the pizza I have gotten from other locations so I decided to give them a go. When I called to place my order the gentleman who took my information was very friendly and polite. He told me the specials and I went with the two one topping pizzas for $17.99. I decided to pick up because we live close to the restaurant. Our pizzas were ready in 20 minutes, just like I was told. The girl who helped me at the counter was pleasant and she took care of me quickly. I ordered a large pepperoni and a large mushroom pizza. The pizza was nice and hot. The crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. There was lots of yummy melted cheese and entry of our chosen toppings. I have a household of two teen aged boys and a husband was a pretty good appetite and two pizzas was plenty for everyone. I think Barros makes a great pizza and is a great value too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"GLUTEN-FREE REVIEW: (i.e., this review specifically pertains to their gluten-free pizza)  Thin crust. It was burned. The dough and cheese and tomato sauce are really, really piled on. On a thin crust.  Life's too short for trial-and-error with GF items that might or might be good. I tried Barro's GF, big mistake, won't do it again.   My conclusion: \"GF Menu Item That Feeds Into Bad Celiac Stereotypes.\""}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. We have never had a bad pizza from here and all the toppings are cooked just right. The crust is fantastic whether you get it thin or regular. We like to get a thin crust with the toppings because it makes them shine a little bit more and it's still just as amazing as the traditional crust on a classic pizza. The wings medium are a normal buffalo and they pair so well with the ranch. We love to go again and again. The only downside is that the wait for delivery can be a little long. Other than that, it's our pizza joint."}
{"text":"What happen to the service ?  The staff at the old location was more friendly and responsive. I am always waiting to pick up my order. The pizza is a still great, but the service at the new location is poor. Management needs to get involved and improve the service."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for Arizona standards. I have had the meat lovers version in the past. A bit too greasy and mega calories per slice (450 cals) Today is mushroom and tomato pizza which should keep me from making several visits to the toilet. Atmosphere is nice here with plenty of TVs to watch wherever you look. Suggest getting here early on a Friday PM if you want to get a booth."}
{"text":"Always the best place for lunch or dinner. Fast and great customer service. Not to mention the best dough and sauce around!"}
{"text":"Barro's pizza is so amazing! This is my favorite pizza. Their lunch deals a great! You can get one to three slices with salad and a drink for a good price. Carry out deals are good as well. They have a simple menu. The pizza crust is so fluffy. You will find yourself eating the crust, which means the pizza is the best!  I have to mention that the last few times I have come to this location they only have one cashier when there are 10 people standing in line and you have to wait while to put your order in. Especially if you are coming during the time of the lunch specials. There usually isn't a problem with the pizza being ready to serve. I hope that they can get at least two people on the registers during their busy hours to help customers.  There are many shops in this area but the is no problem with parking.  This is hands down my favorite pizza and I literally force my friends to eat it (or at least try it out). I definitely recommend people to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Barro's is our favorite local pizza place. The food is really good & the prices are totally reasonable...it's a great place to grab dinner from during the work week, weekend lunch, or grubbing food for a day watching sports.   The pizzas are great. The crust is nice and thick with a very clean bread taste. The pizza sauce is very flavorful and the cheese is piled on plentifully. The pizza is just slightly salty and greasy (from the melted cheese), in a very pleasant and delicious way. Each bite into a slice is warm, cheesy, and oozy. This is exactly the kind of comforting pizza you want after a long day. The vegetarian pizza is awesome as well - tons of fresh veggie toppings and super thick.  The cheesy bread is really amazing - delightfully thick crust covered in a buttery garlic topping smothered in cheese served with pizza or marinara sauce (your choice) for dipping. The $3 price tag for what amounts to a medium-sized pizza can't be beat, either. The cinnamon bread is gigantic, a wonderful dessert, and it's nearly impossible to stop eating. It's basically pizza crust covered in butter and cinnamon sugar, served with sugar glaze dipping sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"Had a #4 lunch special with 2 slices and drink for $4.33 including tax. The slices were so hood I took my daughters back and got them their own specials also. Thumbs up from this family! I wish they had sweetened tea as a beverage though."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but they should have more staff to help out. Their lunch special is supposed to run through 12-3 and they always run out of pizza around 2:15 and they don't make anymore for the remaining 45 minutes of their lunch special. They also need more staff to clean, that place is always a mess and cleaning shouldn't be put on the same person who has to take all the orders and run the food out."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pizza. Nice thick crust. Even though I am a thin crust man, this pizza is very good for the area. I will be back again for pizza. Staff is friendly; manager is cool. All in all, great place. That's why they are getting 5 stars. Customer service"}
{"text":"My favorite traditional style pizza in the valley. Amazing large wings with a great sauce selection. Inexpensive lunch specials of various slices/salad/drink combos. Not only is the sauce tasty, the by the slice selection good, the crust delicious and the cheese to sauce ratio perfect, but the slices are huge. Gluten free crusts are available as well and although not thick they are consistent with the standard of pretty much every gluten free crust in the valley. If you haven't tried it, do. I don't know if they house make their ranch or not but I could buy it in gallons. Did I mention they serve beer and wine? I wish I could come here daily lunch. Also friendly, fast service. Never a complaint from me in years and of course I visit many of their locations. I only wish they were open later for my late night cravings ;-) . Thank you Barros"}
{"text":"02/09/2018 New location opened and it was fairly busy when we arrived. Our order was taken quickly and accurately. Food is taken to your table which is nice and unlimited drinks are available for self service. Plus the eating area is surrounded by TVs to watch sports.  Dinner for 3 was $48  Large Pizza 12 wings large salad  kids meal  drinks"}
{"text":"So we just got our pizza to the table. Sitting there watching the Bears game, when they change both tv's to the Yankee's/Indians game. Doesn't matter that people are watching football. When asked if they could put the football game back on just one t.v. all we get is a blank stare and a to go box. I guess we are going somewhere else to watch the game and have some grub."}
{"text":"I had really like there gluten free pizza but they just changed the crust that they use and now it's awful! I wish they would have left it alone. I will no longer be ordering pizza from them."}
{"text":"The pizza was not bad.  I've definitly had better.  The crust is just very heavy.  I'm sure I will have it again, just no go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Bomb. Bomb. Bomb. Bomb. Bomb. My girl and I moved here recently from out of state and were seeking the perfect pizza place. Found a lot of shitty spots and then we tried Barros. We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza cause I had a coupon. They delivered pretty far to get to us and got it here in a timely manner considering they had to get through the gates of the apartment complex and find our apartment tucked in the back of the complex (and it was still hot). And something as simple and boring as a pepperoni pizza couldn't have been made so perfectly. Cheese was bomb sauce was bomb crust was bomb and the pepperoni was cooked perfectly (not too crispy but not undercooked). The only thing that bummed me out is after I was done I wished I would have ordered something with more toppings. Go to spot for sure!"}
{"text":"This place landed me in the hospital with a serious case of food poisoning. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Great new location to replace the old location at Tatum & Dynamite. The inside is newer and much larger, and there is a nice outdoor patio with umbrellas and string lights. The pizza is as good as ever! Love the classic cheese on original crust, the breadsticks with cheese, and the dessert pizza. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time the pizza was excellent. The crust is the best I have ever had and the toppings taste fresh.  The pizzas are not overly greasy, even when re-heated.  The service is very friendly and inviting and the pizzas come out fast."}
{"text":"This pizza really satisfied! It was a good price for what you get. This is a great place to get pizza with a short wait. The flavors were all there. Great staff."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times, service is good along with the food. However, this past visit, I only had 2 slices of a medium cheese, and the crust tasted really weird to me. An hour later I'm throwing up, on the verge of passing out and spent about 5 hours in the bathroom. I'm thinking that dough was old and now I have food poisoning the day before Easter."}
{"text":"Empty restaurant. 35 + minutes waiting for an xl pizza I called in. They didn't even put it in until I got  here 20 minutes after ordering. Not a good representation of Barro's. This location is clearly mismanaged."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza and 12 wings. The price was $24 when I got there I asked them if they had any specials.. The very rude girl working the counselor told me they have a large pizza 24 wings special for $26, I told her when I placed the order they should have informed me for two dollars more I could've doubled my wings. Her response was yeah some people don't want 24 wings. I asked if they can make 12 more for me and give me the special and was told no they were already made she can't change it."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their pizza! So good. Oh, and their cheese bread. Yum. Staff is nice too!"}
{"text":"At about 12 o'clock this afternoon I was thinking to myself \"I want some pizza for lunch where should I go?\"  \"Barro's!\" I screamed outloud in reply to my own question. So I borrowed $5 from my old lady and off I went.  I got the lunch special. Two slices of pepperoni pizza and a drink. I threw down the extra cash to get a side of ranch for dipping. Best decision of the day.  This location is a little far away from where I stay but it's worth the drive. Super clean place. Friendly staff. The girl at front counter is always nice. I don't know her name but she has a tattoo on the back of her neck. Thanks, neck tattoo girl! I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for a group meeting. The pizza was a little on the salty side . We ordered their thin  pizza which was tasty but I think I like their deep dish better. Had their wings which were spicy but  they were sour from the Tabasco sauce and the skin was soggy. We also ordered their penned pasta  with marinara sauce. The pasta was firm and had a fair amount of cheese"}
{"text":"I just spent almost twenty bucks on a pizza and fountain drink, and after sitting down, realized I wanted a small cup of pizza sauce to dip my crust in. I asked a waitress for a cup, and was informed it would be .55 for basically a spoonful of the sauce. After letting her know I didn't have cash and didn't really want to put .55 on my debit card, I figured she would be kind and get me some just to be nice... Nope. After asking for a manager, I informed him that I eat there regularly, and was kinda put out that they couldn't get me a little bit of pizza sauce to enjoy my pizza without charging me. Assumed at this point that Shawn could override the \"dip policy\", and again I was let down that he wouldn't help me out with a little dip. So here's how it goes... Barros cares more about a .55 cup of dip, than keeping a customer happy, or receiving a poor review. Well, they got to keep their dip, but have lost me as a customer, and have gotten a poor review... Hope it was worth the 55 cents!"}
{"text":"Well I must say the food here was great and the service excellent however I felt like I was victim of false advertising. I ordered the large spaghetti priced 5.99 on the wall menu board, apparently the price went up to 9.99 which was updated on the menu itself but not on the wall board. After the cashier rang me up she had to get an override and I didn't have time to wait around so I reluctantly paid 9.99 for my spaghetti and left. Brownie points docked to whomever manages this restaurant. If your going to make a price change and you can't update it on the wall board right away at least take it down or something. This is very misleading and irritating."}
{"text":"Great ham, bacon and black olive pizza. Just what I needed for a late working lunch. Thanks Barro's team."}
{"text":"We are regulars here.  Love the convenience of having a Barro's near us!  Great pitcher deals and we love the wings."}
{"text":"Service here is horrible and so is Justine  below who is clearly defending her friend and making a whole lot of stuff up!!   I ordered my food, came 26 mins after I was told it would be ready and was told a few more mins when I got there, I then asked the girl behind the counter how much longer with a tad bit of frustration since I came later and had my 2 small kids w me, she came back and said it was being cut now but as she had walked away I stated that \"this was ridiculous\" and now her friend is trying to say I called her \"retarded\" and that bothers me bc I didn't yell or scream at the girl and didn't even blame her but then she comes back and clearly starts bitching about me in front of me to her friend Justine below!! My issue was w Barro and the wait time and now bc I ordered from them I'm having to talk with someone on getting this girl to remove my name and get accusations from yelp and a whole defamation thing!!! So yes Barros is the worst and I won't go there bc I have a bad experience and then not only deal with them but their friends"}
{"text":"Waited for your promised time of 45 minutes. It's now been over an hour. I have a classroom full of students waiting who were affected by your company's delay and lack of compassion.   Called to ask eta. They said if it wasn't here in 5 minutes, I should call back... I shouldn't have to keep checking on my order!   Waited another 10 minutes, and called for a second time. Your cashier was not empathetic when dealing with this. She said \"I really don't know what to tell you. Our drivers don't have gps.\"  The delay is not my main issue. It's the fact that every time I contacted you after waiting an hour on two pizzas, I was told to wait another ten minutes. And the driver still didn't show. I had to keep telling a room full of people \"pizzas on its way\" \"no it's not, but it will be\".   45 minutes for two pepperoni pizzas was excessive. An hour and twenty minutes with no real answer on eta? Ridiculous. If Pizza Hut can estimate an accurate time, why can't you?   I asked to speak to a manager on the phone to inform them of the phone operators lack of empathy. Waited 5 minutes and no on ever picked up.    Way to run a business. I'm so embarrassed and will strongly think against using you for my Corporate events again.  Way to run a business. I'm so embarrassed and will strongly think against using you for my Corporate events again."}
{"text":"I love it when you call a business and the person on the other end is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the product.  Her input for adding the jalepano's to the Meatza pie made our pizza *SiNg*.  Pizza arrived in the 45 min I was told, hot, and the driver was friendly and mindful not to let our dog out!!    If your looking for a slew of toppings, some tasty side's - like hot wings with and without the bones, at a reasonable price - this location is it!"}
{"text":"Pizza ain't so good I found myself eating the cheesy soft part off the top and leaving the hard flavorless crust in the box."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! My family and I just moved into the area and found this place. Great food, service, prices and especially great for families with children :) We definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Damn good wings. Best honey BBQ I've had.  Super friendly service. 5 stars! Pizza was good too."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The only odd thing was employee was fixing a salad and using latex gloves to scoop her salad fixins in her bowl why does she think that's ok??? Did she walk out there and not touch anything before hand??"}
{"text":"Love this place. Its always busy and a long wait, however worth it. The delivery staff is always nice!"}
{"text":"Good thick crust pizza. Also had wings and a salad. All is good. The wing sauce is a little different but tasty. Certainly worth a try. Yum."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time.  Crust is not too thick and not too thin, toppings were perfect."}
{"text":"Great pizza, Pasta and service. We love that they have fresh brewed tea available. This location is always clean. A big plus is the garlic powder available in the shakers!"}
{"text":"First and most likely the last time we go.  Maybe being from Chicago I am a bit picky when it comes to pizza.  Don't get me wrong with the 2 star rating.  The restaurant was clean, ordering was quick and easy, front counter lady was very polite and actually smiled, rare for the Phoenix area.  So why a 2 star ?  We ordered the Chicken Pizza, original crust was great, chicken, green peppers, etc., all good. It was the first time in my life that I had pizza sauce with NO FLAVOR AT ALL.  At first I thought it was just me, but then the other 3 at our table all made the same comment, \"SAUCE IS BLAND.\"  The sauce should have some type of flavor, but it had none, I do mean NONE.  This made me wonder if it was tomato based or some type of imitation red sauce.  We won't go back, maybe this was just a fluke experience, don't know, but don't want to give it another try. Would like to know if others had the same experience also. Oh well, lot of other pizza restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Barro's pizza is really good. Once a month we take the kids there and let them run around in the game room, so we can have a nice conversation.  It's great.  Kids have fun, stay out of our hair and we don't have to pick up toys afterwards."}
{"text":"This place has become an Arizona institution, and no trip to visit the folks would be complete without pizza from this place at some point...  There is something about their dough and sauce that makes the pizza so good.  And I like the way the onions are diced.  Good stuff...  The hot wings are awesome, too..."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious.. Crust was crispy on the out side soft inside. Meatball sandwich was also delicious. Salad bar was good but needs a little more options. Overall the place deserves a 5star.."}
{"text":"This entire place is dirty. There are napkins and trash all over the floor, the place is completely dead.... they have enough people on staff to do a quick lobby sweep. To top it all off the staff was not friendly, or accommodating. Every question I asked she gave me a firm yes or no it was not nice or even a conversation. I feel stupid coming here."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. A little bit on the greasy side but that is pizza! I was able to get two large pizzas with 1 topping delivered in about half an hour. The was impressive. The lady that took my call was super kind and courteous and took down my order with ease. The delivery guy was really nice too. I would def. order from them again to try out their other non-pizza products."}

{"text":"Two pizzas two different hairs - first Pizza had a long brown hair in it and second one had this short gray or blond hair - used to be our favorite pizza"}
{"text":"I don't like to trash restaurants but I only gave this Barro's one star because I had too. Very disappointed in the pizza & pizza bread with pizza sauce I ordered but never got. We did the Barro's on Brown Rd & even though it took awhile, it was good pizza, we ate in. Don't know what happened at this place.?? We ordered take out & never saw how bad it was till we got home. The pizza was soggy & limp with thick, too thick outer rim crust!! The pizza bread was what?? Maybe some kind of garlic toast?? & definitely no sauce. We ordered late because we were starved & I never ate any & my husband who is a 3 slice guy, had 1 unenjoyable piece. When we phoned to complain , we got no answer. We trashed $20 & ended up having grilled cheese sandwiches. Sorry Barro's on S Power Rd, a big thumbs down!! Makes me wonder about any Barro's now."}
{"text":"This is the best Barros in the valley. We always order a large extra cheese pepperoni and pineapple and its always fast hot and delicious. The wings are also very good and so us the small side salad. Its a great pizza place"}
{"text":"We ordered this pizza and had it delivered to our hotel. It was fast service. They were very nice over the phone and helped me out with number of ranch to get for my order. Chicken wings and pizza were very yummy."}
{"text":"Hit or miss kinda pizza place. We've had some really good tasting pizza and wings from barros, but sad to say we've had some semi burnt pizza and cold soggy wings too. When we order we like to get the BBQ chicken pizza. Highly recommend going in to eat lunch, that pizza always seems hot and fresh with a great salad bar."}
{"text":"They're in the neighborhood, and we finally gave them a try for takeout.  Pizza, wings, and salad.  All of it was very good, and ready promptly.  My girlfriend found the Italian dressing a little on the sweet side (me too, but I'm not picky), but really, everything else was great.  It's in a quieter part of south Chandler, and it's a good sit down place if it's getting late (we actually got our takeout here because a similar competitor that will remain unnamed was about to close, but Barro's was still open)."}
{"text":"Barros! I love your pizza! However I had some used tea (mango) and their was mold on the spout. Please clean your tea bins daily!  I opened my cup and a slimy film was all over my tea and ice!  Makes me think,  what else dont you clean daily?"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great, always come warm and fresh, wings are good too but sometimes they are not cooked enough, I usually ask for well done. Delivery time is speedy and efficient. This is our go to pizza place here in Anthem!"}
{"text":"My experience here on Friday night was bad enough to prompt me to start a Yelp account to alert anyone considering eating here.  First the positives,  The TVs were positioned in a way that you could see the from from any seat, they seemed to have a decent selection of beers, video games for the kids, the price for 24 hot wings and a small pizza and 2 sodas was $27, I think that would have been a good deal had the food been better.  The wings were typical freezer to fryer cooked too long to the point of dry and tough.  They were cooked hot but the sauce was cold and thick on the wings.  For 24 wings we got four thinner than pencil sticks of celery and three giant containers of shelf stable ranch.  I ordered thin crust pizza, the cheese was good but the edges of the crust were cooked dark brown and cracker crisp.  I asked the girl at the counter, after I tried to eat it and couldn't, if that is how it is always served, after affirming this unusual practice I decided to review them on Yelp.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be.  Just not for me."}
{"text":"We are disappointed in the particular location. The food is good but the service not so much. I get Friday nights are crazy no matter where you go BUT that doesn't excuse bringing individual meals out. We had to ask twice to get the last meal in our order. Unfortunately, the rest of the table was finished eating before it came out. Very unapologetic. Disappointing. I have been to other locations that prioritize the costumer service."}
{"text":"This review is just on the food as I did not go to the actual restaurant. I have always heard nothing but good things and they were right! The pizza I had did not disappoint one bit. Thick and chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and lots of toppings this pizza was made with care and left me wanting more.   The overall flavor kind of reminded me of this place we used to have here in the valley called showbiz pizza. It was the place to go before chuck e cheese moved in (the same company just different mascots). While the price is a little more than I normally put out for pizza it does sometimes pay to fork out a little more dough in order to get something great. The overall look of places like these mean very little given they are all part of a chain of restaurants. They usually have the same table, chair, lighting set up with the only real difference being the people who work there. So I will leave that to be discussed by others but if you have never tried this place or it has been a while I suggest giving them another try tonight!"}
{"text":"Was lied to my face by the manager about a specialty order I requested to make. I've been coming to this location since they've opened and their old location on Ray and Val Vista since 2005. Extremely disappointed that the management staff would lie to a customer. Will not be coming back to this location nor any others."}
{"text":"This pizza seems to be memorable for many Arizonians who live away from home.    Jocelyn gave us great service!   Cheese bread - basically cheese pizza without sauce Vegetable pizza - love the thick dough. Everything about it tastes great and is also quite filling.  Ranch - perfect   One half of the table tops were not clean when we were looking for a seat."}
{"text":"Saucy cheesy goodness ham,peppers olives mushrooms onions is the barros special!My Favorite"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to post a review about this place, I have tried this place a few times. I only get to try it when I go to Arizona, from Cali to visit my friend attending ASU. Really enjoy the pizza here, great taste, sauce, cheese, toppings in general! I am really sad now that my friend has moved back to Cali, for work! Don't know when I will go back to Arizona."}
{"text":"Thank god you guys arrived to Biltmore Arcadia area! Between red devils and Barro's its gonna be a tough decision! Great pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this Barros!!!! Even better than the pasta and the pizza and the salad though is our cashier, Emily. LOVE HER!!!! So kind, so sweet, so charismatic. Give that girl a RAISE!!!!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great wings, and quick service for a Friday night pick-up dinner. Prices are great for the quality/size pizza you get. Wings are flavorfull and the hot wings have a nice kick to them. Nice atmosphere as well with friendly staff. Can't speak to any of the other meals they offer like sandwiches and salads...but I dun go to a pizza place for a sammich. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the better pizza places in the area (good pizza is tough to find in PHX!).  Being from Chicago, I will say this is not true Chicago pizza, but flavor wise it is the closest I have found here.  Good pizza, good garlic bread.  Didn't care for the items on the menu that were anything but pizza though. The sandwiches were greasy to me, and the pasta sauce was bland... Stick with the pizza it's good!"}
{"text":"Read all the bad reviews. My family has eaten there ever since they opened and never had a bad thing to say. Good pizza at a fair price."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  Had the mega meat it was delicious! Staff was extremely friendly and greeted you with a smile as soon as you walked into the restaurant!  Definitely a must try if you're in the Goodyear area!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location since they opened.  Unfortunately, over the past several months (perhaps a newer manager) this location has gone down hill.  I took my family last week and the place was filthy.  There was garbage from previous customers all over the floor.  We were there during a slow time and rather than sweeping the floor or wiping the tables, the girls at the front counter chatted with each other.  There were open booths yet none of them were cleaned.  I asked a worker (every person who works the front counter is a young female who seems to be more interested in their social life than customer service) to wipe down the table.  She went into the kitchen to get a rag.  When she started wiping the table, the stench from the filthy rag almost made me have to leave.  I could not believe she wiped my table with such a soiled rag without noticing the stench.  Unbelievable.  I will not go back until the manager decides to start managing the place.  If Barro's actually reads these reviews, I hope they find a manager that puts customers ahead of his desire to hire cute \"help\"."}
{"text":"I will just start by saying I really like this place. I have no reservations going here for lunch or taking my family out to eat. I have been here by myself and with extended family on several occasions and the quality of food and the staff is consistent.  Barro's pizza is second to none. At least for me that is. It isn't my wife's favorite but she knows I like it so much that she takes one for the team for my sake. All of the pizzas I have had from pepperoni to the works type are very good. Fresh, good ingredients, a little more sauce than other pizza joints make for an awesome pie. Please don't go here and buy a salad. That would completely negate the awesome which is waiting to be made for you.  The other options are also rather good as well. The wings are not my favorite but they are still very good. They are bigger than most wings in the area and the sauce is thicker and stickier than comparable wings as well. They aren't the style I usually prefer but they are big and meaty nonetheless. The flavor is good and the heat is predictable depending on the grade you select. The salad bar always has fresh ingredients if that is your persuasion. I have had one before and they have some good dressings as well. Thankfully, my wife really likes to eat the salad while I devour the pizza she doesn't care for very much.  It's a great little pizza place. Good service, good food, good location and ambiance. Booths and large tables for lots of people or little tables for a quick lunch. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We used to always come for just a pizza, but discovered how good the slices and salad bar is, so we now have decided it's quicker and just as good. Our slices have always been at least warm, salad bar kept clean and stocked. Not many places have a salad bar which I really enjoy!  Surprising to me they have horchata, which I love, since I can't drink soda or very much tea. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and will even bring your slice to the table if they are making more! A very sweet older lady has been there a lot when we visit, she keeps all the tables clean, takes your plates if you are finished. It has always been a nice experience every time we visit."}
{"text":"I love their thin crust pizza.  I order the same damn thing everytime.  The food is good but it's not consistant.    I ask for thin crust, med pep pizza cut in square.  Everytime the crust is a different consistancy.  I don't know what to tell them to keep it the same.   The pizza is still good, I just wish it would be a bit more consistant."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Barros so it sucks that i have to give this particular Barros such low marks. We went in and wow the place was just so asteticly unpleasing... The Barros in Maricopa is 10x more comfortable.   The quality of the pizza was sub par. All the pizzas were slightly burned and covered in grease. Lastly there were flies buzzing about. When my friend pointed it out to the waitress she seemed very smug as she asked him, \"what should we do about it?\" Put up some fly paper, clean the place out. Very unprofessional. Big dissapointed compared to the other locations around the valley."}
{"text":"I like their pizza. However this location is not so great. I work in the same plaza and was given a 45-60 minute wait time for delivery. At 10 minutes after the estimated hour I was about to call when they showed up. Our pizza was not even hot. We had to re heat the pizza we had just got! I understand being busy but I was told at most an hour and when we're I  the same plaza I would expect my pizza to arrive hot. We won't be getting delivery from them again."}
{"text":"Barro's is great.  If you're looking for some standard takeout pizza, this is the place.  Great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  And you might as well ignore that reviewer who gave this restaurant two stars because it's not better than something that is not the same thing at all.  Well, no pizza is good as caviar, so I guess all pizza places should be three stars or lower..."}
{"text":"Barrows is the best! I'm from out of town and my buddy took me here for my first night and made the start of my AZ experience just great!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, they moved closer to my house but doubled the time it takes for a pizza to be delivered.  And, I don't think they care a whole lot..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and hot upon delivery prompt. Very courteous while taking order. I eat here once or twice a month"}
{"text":"Not bad pizza.  the place was very buy with takeout and eat ins.  We always try the woks first,  th staff was helpful being our first time that was good. They gave us a menu and a magnet as first timers.  It took awile to get the pizza but it had lots of toppings.   The manager or owner not sure which came bye to ask if all was okay. We will probably go back because we have yet to find anything a whole lot better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. Yes, it's pricey, but worth it. There's just something about Barro's Pizza crust, it's too good! Regular crust is pretty thick, so I always order well done, that way it stays crispy & isn't all flimsy. Staff is always polite & pretty cheery. Delivery was estimated at 45 minutes & it was here when promised. Delivery driver was super friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Love the anti pasta salad so yummy.. Pizza is always great, fast delivery. Great employees.."}
{"text":"My mozzarella sticks were store bought and cold :( Pizza was lovely though! And they came sooner than they quoted me so good for them!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. We love that their crust is a bit thicker.   Anytime we have ordered a full pizza it has been fantastic. My only criticism is that sometimes the slices you get for the lunch special are not fresh. l got cheese slice was fine but my husband's got the daily special & he said it was the worst pozza he has ever had there. I took a bite & it was crusty/stale tasting.   It would be better if they got rid of the pizza after a certain amount of time. Or we wouldn't mind waiting a couple minutes for them to make a fresh one."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Barros.  A little wait sometimes but well worth it.  Customer service is always on point, even with a younger crowd working there.  Good value.  Food is always hot and a hit with everyone in the family.  It's definitely a favorite pizza spot in Surprise."}
{"text":"We have ordered carry out from here a few times and have had a good experience each time. They are friendly, professional and courteous. Prices are reasonable and they have a nice selection of food to choose from. Food is pretty tasty as well! We will continue to utilize Barro's for our pizza needs!"}
{"text":"I can't help but have a place in my heart for this Barro's. This place was built when I was about a sophomore in High School and was right across the street so we went there at least once a week. Now that my brother is going to the same school, him and his friends do the same thing. But even if there wasn't that... I just really love Barro's Pizza. I crave that soft, bubbly and buttery crust with that stringy perfect Mozzarella topped with crispy Italian sausage!! Uhhhh... I just drooled a little writing that. They also have a great little salad bar where everything is super fresh and cold. I would -1/2 a star because they really do need an update. I was in high school over 10 years ago and they haven't done one thing. Besides that its allll great!!"}
{"text":"They have one delicious mega meat pizza. I ordered it with the super thick crust and it was the most filling pizza I've had in a long time. Their cheese pizza with chicken on top was pretty decent too. We've come back a few times and it's turning into one of our preferred pizza places. Keep up the yum work!"}
{"text":"My family and I have dinner here at least 4 times a month.  They have excellent pizza and terrific wings.  Sometimes, I'll stop and order from their lunch menu which includes an assortment of pizza and a salad bar. I recommend if you're looking for great chicago style pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of pizza but Barro's pizza is great! The staff is super friendly and restaurant is very clean. My boyfriend and I got the breadsticks with cheese for an appetizer because we heard they were great and they were VERY GOOD. For pizza we just got the basic pepperoni with original crust which was also great! Great experience and overall great food!"}
{"text":"Love the food, but when I ask for delivery the girl had no idea about where my cross streets were (Chapperal and Scottsdale road); that isn't a big deal. When I gave my address which is only 9 mins away (4miles) she said I was too far. That is pretty dumb. Way to lose a customer"}
{"text":"I cant remember the last time I had anything other than the lunch special here.  Today, like dozens of other days before, I waited in a small line of dudes, all on lunch break from whatever drywall contracting or landscape company they work for, to get my two slices and a drink for $4.50. A pretty damn good deal for what you get! Not Costco good, but still a great value.   The pizza is solid; crispy, chewy crust, mildly flavorful sauce, tasty sausage, generous, quality cheese, etc. It's possibly a bit doughy at times and for some peoples taste, but overall a decent slice. You could do worse. I usually wait until after they've rung me up to ask for a side of wing sauce to dip my crust in, they'll usually not bother charging you that way.  The place looks like it was decorated by guy who sustained a brain injury as an adolescent boy and has been stuck as an emotional man child since. Trophies, sports paraphernalia, etc.. adorns the the otherwise blank walls.Faux wood, dingy carpet, and catalog stock furniture round out the ambiance. Its oddly too nice to be a charming \"hole in the wall\", and too corny to be nice.   Overall...Barro's is hearty, serviceable, and  non-fancy....just like the workin' stiffs it attracts."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Valley!   We had their BBQ Chicken pizza, which is just phenomenal, and also a thin crust pepperoni pizza.  Barro's has the best wings for a pizza joint for sure.  And they should"}
{"text":"Great food quick service a little over priced normally get delivery always quick to my house"}
{"text":"Barro's  pizza is always good. Whenever, whatever toppings omg just delicious, at least at this location. Recently I ordered a Hawaiian pizza(don't remember name) but it had a light teriyaki sauce instead of pizza sauce and pineapple and teriyaki chicken on top. This was at a Maricopa Barros btw.  The only pizza I have ever been grossed out by omg it tasted like they put waaaay too much teriyaki sauce on the bread, maybe on accident but it was so disgusting, the sauce was literally dripping off of the pizza everytime I picked it up. I don't think I'll ever order that pizza again but I will definitely not go to the maricopa location ever again.  Tempe locations have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Barro's in Anthem is the best in this neighborhood. While I prefer a thin crust Chicago style pizza, the reality is you cannot get a good one around here--so, Barro's is the \"go to\" for a number of reasons. Whether you have delivery, take away or eat in, the food is great--and consistent! Friendly service on the phone and in person always start the experience on the right foot. The establishment is clean as a whistle (at least in the FOH, as I haven't been in the back). The pizza is hot, fresh and overflowing with toppings--high quality toppings, at that. Bravo, Barro's of Anthem, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"picked up an order to go.  The manager at the register was very charismatic and helpful.  He said give about 15 mins and it will be up.  25 mins later I went back to the counter and he saw me and went back and got order right out.  The conversation going on from the kitchen area was not very appropriate, especially when people are easily within earshot.  I watched a couple orders be made and did not see anyone wash their hands moving from one order to the next.    A girl working the counter made a salad and took it in back to eat it.  As people came in she would come out to greet them, but was still chewing food while she did so.   The food was good, but the customer service was not that good.  They need a leader in there, and better food handling skills."}
{"text":"We eat pizza more than I'd like to admit... We've tried pretty much every place within a reasonable distance to our house and so far, Barros has been the most consistent.   I won't say that it's the best pizza, because it's not. It will satisfy your pizza craving, but it's not GREAT pizza. It is however, reasonably priced and always delivered within 45 minutes. Additionally, the people answering the phone will always be pleasant and fast. That's why we continue coming here.   I do recommend the garlic cheesy bread though, I would say it's better than the pizza."}
{"text":"Went last night, Sunday at about 7-8pm, with about 6 other people, and the kid behind the counter was super nice and friendly, food came out hot and fast."}
{"text":"I have had Barros at 2 other locations and loved the pizza and the service. However, I will not be returning to this location. I called in my order for take out and arrived @ time it was supposed to be ready for pick up. I was told it would be a few more min and took a seat. After waiting 25 more minutes (seated in front of a grip of staff working the front), a manager came from the back and asked what I was waiting on. He then pulled it from the warmer beside all the front desk staff. Yes, my order had been ready this whole time! All the staff knew I was waiting for my take out order and didn't bother to check this or follow up? What is worse is that they sent me on my way with that food that had been sitting there the whole time and no, I was not offered fresh food nor a refund. I was too tired of being there in the less than inviting restaurant listening to less than professional convos amongst the staff to do anything about it. Needless to say, the food wasn't fresh or tasty and the experience was all so ridiculous, I could only laugh about it and say...that just happened! I give 2 stars because no staff was rude or anything. They seemed to truly not know better."}
{"text":"Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"I always feel like I over pay for my pizza... Barro's should have a loyalty program. Make me feel like I'm getting appreciated for buying a $20 Lg pizza."}
{"text":"This is my first choice in pizza, both in taste and in value.  I love their lunch specials - best value around.  Their sausage is so awesome - the best ever.  All of their ingredients are very high quality and I have never had a badly done pizza, and I have been a customer there since they opened over ten years ago.  I like ordering at the counter because I don't feel guilty if I don't have much or anything for a tip.  They are always very friendly.  I have had a couple of minor issues with their delivery, but they always make up for it and make it right for the customer.  I think they bend over backwards to make the customer happy.  It's really my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and they have a great little salad bar. Consistently one of the best pizza places in Goodyear area. Never had bad service or a bad order. Boneless chicken wings pretty damn tasty too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their pizza but they have no Gun sign on the front door which causes me to drop my review from a five star down to a four star. I shouldn't be forced to unarm myself creating a victim zone for my family and friends. Their pizza is just good enough that I will disarm myself."}
{"text":"Lunch special is a great price. For dinner I love to get there Kona pizza."}
{"text":"Barros is my favorite pizza joint in town. We frequent this location for lunch. $4 for two slices and a drink. C'mon, you can't beat that.  Their crust is delicious, generous toppings and it just tastes damn good everytime. Go there and get the meat trio and kick back watching ESPN.  The slam and negative comments below from Brett B crack me up. That dude is way off. Why does he have 59 check-ins here if he only gave the place one star?"}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza joint. I've been here numerous times and the pizza is always delicious. My favorite is the Barro's Special (Pepperoni, ham, onions, green pepper and mushrooms). It's a nice thick and hearty style pizza with a great tasting crust. They have a play area with a little kitchen, legos and TV playing Nickelodean for the kids which is great. They also have ESPN on so I can chill and watch some sports while the kids play."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have a local pizza place like Barros. I am writing because of the service and friendliness of the staff and management. I visited last night to pick up my pizza and wings, which were great!!! In chatting with Tim the manager, I asked why they would no longer to deliver to my house which is about two blocks out of their delivery area. He went and got a map, highlighted where I live and said that they would start delivery to my area and home. Talk about going above and beyond. Thanks Tim and thanks Barros for having employees that truly care about their customers!!"}
{"text":"Holly cow once you try this pizza it will be your families new pizza place!! If you're a thin crust person the thin crust pizza is good, but their original crust tops the charts. The prices are reasonable and the pizza is phenomenal. I have been going to Barros since it was new to the valley and the quality has been great since the beginning. The best part about Barros is that not only is their pizza phenomenal, but their wings will make your mouth water also.   I frequent this location so much that I have become more adventurous since I am seldom disappointed in their food. If you're looking for something a little different I highly recommend their BBQ chicken pizza it actually has BBQ sauce as opposed to to red sauce. Also their Honey Hot wings have a great taste as well!   If it is your first time try the basics (pepperoni pizza and hot wings) I assure you, you have not had rising crust as good as theirs! Furthermore, my goodness... that cheese on the pizza. Your pizza for the first time will actually look like what they promise in the pictures, the cheese will stretch as you pull each piece!  ****Tips:  get the hot wings well done, adds a crunch to your bite and their sooooo darn good.  they are always willing to do certain toppings on only portions of the pizza so sharing is simple."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Barro's pizza today for lunch. I had never been and when we walked in we waited to be seated. Even though we were the only people in the restaurant we were not greeted or helped for about 5 minutes until I walked to the counter and was very rudely told that I need to order up at the counter. Their pizza is good, but try being more friendly to first timers. Especially when there is no sign indicating what to do."}
{"text":"Our first Barro's delivery experience was a decent one. After reading other reviews, it looks like Barro's must be reading them and changing things up because we didn't have ANY of the same issues others have had. Honestly, I think it's all about customer preference with this place. We ordered the \"large 1 topping pizza & 24 wings\" special. We chose the regular crust (after reading poor reviews on their thin crust) pepperoni pizza and 12 hot wings & 12 garlic parm wings. They quoted us a 55-65 minute delivery time on a Saturday, but got here in 40 mins! We've been eating a lot of NY style pizza lately, and so we chose Barro's to try something different. First of all, the pizza is INSANELY cheesy (like the kind in commercials where the cheese strings out when you pull it away from the box!), so if you like cheesy pizza, you'll love Barro's! The sauce isn't as sweet as Papa John's (thank goodness! ), but there is definitely a hint of sweetness in their sauce. I don't like sweet sauce at all, but Barro's pizza sauce didn't bother me. We got the original style crust and it's just that - very traditional and doughy, but not chewy (another plus). Now on to the wings - this is where preference really comes in. Wing Stop is my fave wing place, and my hubs really likes BWW, so we can't help but compare all wings to those. That being said, Barro's is really nothing like either of those. One plus, Barro's wings are quite large - lots of meat! Our wings were drowned in sauce, so no need to order \"extra sauce\" as I later read others recommended. We now realize we prefer dry rub garlic parm, over the garlic parm sauced wings that Barro's serves. Again, preference. The garlic parm wings are very very garlicky, so yay for garlic lovers.  The hot wings were sauced perfectly, and were okay on flavor - not super buffalo flavored, which for me was a tad disappointing, but overall good. I most appreciated that the wings still had a bit of a crispiness to the skin, even though they were sauced. I cannot stand soggy-skinned wings, which thankfully Barro's aren't! The ranch dip is great - we ordered one extra for our 24 wings and ended up with 3 single serving sauces - perfect!   So overall, Barro's was good - we will most likely order from them again, but because we prefer NY style, they most likely won't be our go-to place. Great place for a change up though!"}
{"text":"For those evenings when you don't feel like cooking, I'm willing to bet you consider pizza.     Barro's pizza is one of my family's guilty pleasures.  It's great on those nights when you really don't feel like moving from the couch.    These guys pour on the toppings at your request -- so their 'everything' pizza is REALLY thick.  It really is Chicago style pizza.  Not deep-dish, but thick.  If you decide to eat at their location, be prepared to visit a typical no-frills, booths-n-tables, old-opaque-style-plastic-cups-and-plastic-pitchers-of-soda style pizza joint.  It's reasonable (but not that entertaining) for families with kids.    It's much nicer in my opinion if you order out.    If you like Parmesan cheese or red-pepper packets, be sure to ask for some when you order.  Normally, the drivers don't have any on hand.  In my opinion, this place is good low brow pizza.  Better than big chains like Papa Johns or Pizza Hut, but not as nice as places like Uno's, Oreganos, or California Pizza Kitchen."}
{"text":"The staff here are absolutely awesome friendly. Purchased the pepperoni and white pizza with the cheese garlic sticks. I'm from. Another state, new resident and were still going to have to search for that perfect pizza/crust. This was good but it wasn't it for us. The staff would be the reason I'd return and that's more than I can say from where I came from."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice, a salad bar, bottled beer, clean dining room and take out :)  Thumbs up Barro's, I've always been a fan of your pizza pie!  You can trust me, I'm in the business ;D"}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the pizza but my kids loved the pizza and garlic bread. The price was great and the staff was friendly over the phone and at pick up."}
{"text":"First time I sat down in a Barros. I've done takeout several times for my celiac daughter.   We arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night and there were still 5 full tables. Pretty cool that they stay open until 11.   We ordered a gluten free pizza and some wings. The pizza is always special because we know it is safe from glutens, which always take out my daughter. The pizza was hot, with a chewy crust and plenty of fresh toppings.   The wings were exceptional. I had never had them here before but I won't make that mistake again. We ordered a dozen bone in wings with hot sauce. They arrived in about 10 mins piping hot, plenty of spicy sauce and good, meaty wings.   Our service, even tho they wanted to close the restaurant, was pleasant and accommodating.  I recommend this Barros for a solid late meal with good service."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here.  Frequent this place a few times per month."}
{"text":"Thatpizza is great the problem is the service there's no smile there's no communication while you order then they bring out your food and don't speak either. Just for info they do not card under age kids that order beer"}
{"text":"Please note this location has moved to 48th St and Ray.  It's in the strip center by The Roomstore.  I think their pizza and wings are good.   The food is reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Pepperoni, Sausage and Black Olive rocks!!!! these folks can go head to head against any other pizza in town. Their regular crust is the bomb and this combination is my favorite. The wife loves the ham and pineapple but she eats one of her slices hen shares the rest of my fave. This place is great for celebrations with plenty of seating, has a an outdoor patio and has a good beer selection and wine list is typical small assortment. He service has always been great and the ingredients fresh. I would like to try the pan style pizza one day with the whole kitchen sink in it!"}
{"text":"I finally tried the Pepperoni Last week. This was fantastic! Original crust, crunchy Pep. all the right stuff!"}
{"text":"It's great they have gluten free pizza...too bad our order kept getting pushed to the side.  We waited over an hour.  The girls at the counter were really sweet.  Someone needs to kick the cook."}
{"text":"If there was an option for no star I would choose that. Ordered delivery last night and when we got it it was cold which is ok because of it being delivery. Our pizza was not cooked all the way through and we were chewing on raw dough. We ordered boneless wings and besides being freezing cold they looked as though they had the batter pulled off and when I bit into a wing, there was a small but very hard plastic like piece that I bit down on. We ended up throwing the food away. I paid approx. $26 plus a tip for the delivery guy. I really should have called and asked for my money back...$30 for pizza is crazy. Usually go pick up but I am recovering from surgery at the moment. We were really upset. No more barros for me"}
{"text":"The Pizza took a little longer to get to us then the 45 minutes promised. We order wings and the white pizza. Though the pizza was ok it was cold so we're the too spicy ( mild) runny sauce wings. To be fair when I called and complained the manager Amanda was apologetic and kind. Though she could not credit my card back she offered a re delivery right away. When I turned that down she put a full credit on record.so hopefully the next time we call the meal will be warmer. Thanks Amanda"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. Original crust was just right! Sausage pineapple and black olives yummy"}
{"text":"Accomodated special diet request, grilled chicken on shredded cabbage topped with avocado slices. Thumbs up Rubios"}
{"text":"Great pizza and surprisingly fast delivery (arrived in 25 minutes when I was initially told an hour.) Got the meat lover's, hot wings, and meatballs covered with cheese and marinara all which were good.   Presentation wise, food all looked superb, especially for your standard Pizza franchise. Everything looked appetizing and didn't disappoint.  Overall I'd be willing to try Barro's again."}
{"text":"Ordered a 10\" pizza (half cheese, half mushroom), 6 mozzarella sticks, and two drinks. Came out to about $15 and that was definitely a great price for the quality. The pizza's a bit thick, but it doesn't take away from the flavor. Staff was super friendly, I'm definitely having lunch here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza places in the valley. Try the Kona. You won't be disappointed. Fast, super friendly service/delivery. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a gluten free pizza and salad, wanted to try it out.  The pizza was not that great, crust was ok but topping included way too many raw onions and inconsistent vegetable sizes. Also because there were too many large watery veggies it made it extremely difficult to eat. Way too heavy of a pizza.  The antipasta salad included mushrooms even though it didn't say so online. Again with all the raw onions yuck. The lettuce tasted horrible too..   I made it somehow through half of the pizza and a quarter of the salad before giving up on them.   Glad I didn't pay much for it otherwise I wouldn't be a happy camper!  The staff there are a little odd too.."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad visit yet! Friendly staff and pretty tasty pizza. I do enjoy it more at the restaurant versus take out though the delivery isn't too shabby. I guess there is something to be said about it being brought to you versus schlubbing around town to get it yourself. They even deliver all the way over to me in El Mirage.   I prefer crispy thin crust (NY style) pizza and they are able to accommodate easily and happily. The toppings are fresh and not greasy. And they are great community partners by offering restaurant night fundraisers as well. Gotta love that! Looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Made my original order, which came in 45 mins. Turns out my pizza was incorrect. ONIONS were on my pizza when I specifically asked for no onions. My husband called and said we were not happy. The manager assured they could rush a pizza out in 15-20 mins. 47 MINUTES later our correct pizza arrived. So in total, it took over an hour and a half to get a correct pizza delivered to our house( less than 1 mile away). Very poor customer service and a manager that just tells you what you want to hear. Thank you for ruining our dinner. And my 1 year old was asleep before the pizza got there....not acceptable."}
{"text":"Let me start by making it clear that I'm a bit weird when it comes to food. The only pizza I can eat is gluten-free pizza, usually. So finding one that's A) Good, and B) reasonably priced, is pretty special to me. Barro's gluten-free pizzas are not as good as Picazzo's, IMO, but they're definitely good, and you can get out of there for under $20, and often for under $15 (usually it's $20-25 or more at Picazzo's). Service is fine, the place is clean. A nice place to hang out and enjoy a meal with a friend or a book."}
{"text":"While I absolutely LOOOVE Barros pizza, I prefer to drive to the one on Alma School, my kids love playing there. I have to order delivery from the one on Baseline in Tempe, which is why I'm writing this review. I understand the employees that work there can be young and maybe this is their first job, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE train your employees NOT to repeat your card # back to you over the telephone! Even though I have a chip in my card that made me super uncomfortable! Delivery tends to take awhile, but this is my favorite pizza place in AZ because you CANNOT beat the taste!"}
{"text":"I really love the thin crust pizza they offer. I loved it so much I ordered it again the next night. The wings are also pretty good. The delivery time was average but the drivers were both very nice. If haven't tried this place you really should. I have my favorite place for pizza but this one is next in line. :)"}
{"text":"I have long heard that Barros has great pizza but disregarded the compliments for years for reasons my wee little brain can't fathom.  Maybe some built in prejudice because it looked like a place my family went when I was a child??  Who knows where the silly notion began...but my distrust has been rendered foolhardy.   Recently we had a scary movie night at home, which called for pizza. We decided to try Barros because they deliver and we don't like the Dominos types of delivery pizza.   Short story...the service on the phone was friendly and prompt, the delivery was as well, plus the pizza was delivered piping hot. Then... I bit into this pizza that I was so hesitant to try for the last 4 years...  YUM!!  What a waste of 4 years driving to distant locations for a good pizza when it was only a couple miles away AND has free delivery!!  This is very dangerous. I may need to up my workouts to accommodate this newly found nearby deliciousness on a crust.  I ate an entire small pizza in 24 hours!!  The. Entire. Pizza!! ?   The husband had to get his own pizza.   PS: they have yummy green olives as a topping choice. I love green olives!!  I'm so glad you e finally tried it (glad and worried it's too yummy and close)"}
{"text":"Went here the other night with a group of people. Food was good. Price was fine and the place was clean. What we enjoyed  most was the patio is not pet friendly. It was fun to spend a nice evening outside on the patio and not have people forcing their animals on us. No barking, no going to the bathroom in front of us when we are eating. We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday 25th of march.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service.  Teenagers behind counter on phones, and just laughing and screwing around, all tables hadn't been wiped down, trash all over the floor. They forgot to put our order in to the back so we sat for 30 minutes while they all stared at us and couldn't figure out why we had no food.  Went in bathroom,  GROSS GROSS.  I'll leave it at that.  Finally someone came over and figured out they messed up bad.  Half ass apology.  Very very disappointing.  Someone needs to get this staff in order quickly."}
{"text":"Their thin crust pizza is really good.  The crust is a little thicker and \"doughier\" than most, and the sauce is very tasty.   If you like hot wings, try their hot wing pizza...it's pretty good!  I also thought their hot wings were pretty good for a pizza joint.  Their boneless wings were so-so.  Overall, it's one of the better pizza places in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special with a salad. Was told it would be brought out. Girl behind the counter was too busy talking and flirting with another coworker. We left after the people behind us got their order and we got no salad. First time at this barros and first bad experience at any barros.   Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza in the valley, but you will pay for it. More expensive than your dominoes or Pizza Hut. But much better quality. Great selection, their wings are amazing particularly the sweet chili and the garlic butter, I like the pepperoni pineapple and jalapeño pizza! Delish!"}
{"text":"Delivery took forever and pizza was doughy - almost raw. Ended up cooking mac n cheese at home!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service.   The honey hot wings are the best around.  Restaurant is always clean.  Staff is always quick and nice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get pizza and wings. Customer service is always top notch. The delivery man accidentally forgot our wings which was no big deal as he told us that they are in the way! The manager delivered them himself and apologized."}
{"text":"Delicious white pizza with added veggies on a crispy thin gluten free crust. Service was friendly and prompt. We had just arrived from a long hard trip up north. Barro's hit a home run. Thanks. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Barro's and is my go-to spot for delivery. Barro's pizza has the best crusts, sauces, and pizza overall. Service is always on point and delivery times are always reasonable."}
{"text":"Friends from Washington State eat here whenever they are in town and brought us along. My wifes simple pizza was nice and fresh and very good. I had the wings which were very tasty with just the right heat. I liked them enough to return for more within a week."}
{"text":"Usually barros is very consistent with their taste and quality, this last time we went it wasn't as good. They need to change their honey bbq sauce back to the original, this time is tasted very orangey. The pizza wasn't cut very well and the lack of the toppings were all put towards the middle"}
{"text":"Food is always good! If you order wings for deliver or takeout be smart and get the sauce on the side (Toss them at home in a tupperware with a lid). Good service and food was ready on time!"}
{"text":"Almost every Friday night, my husband and I order from this Barros location. We typically purchase an extra large pepperoni pizza, which is more than enough. We order the extra large so that we can have left overs for the rest of the week. We love Barros pizza because of its great quality of ingredients. Not only do they provide delicious pizza, it is all at an  affordable price. Tasty AND affordable? I'M THERE!"}
{"text":"When I placed my order over the  I was quoted approximately $75.00 for 2 extra large pizzas and 48 wings and I honestly thought they had added wrong, when I got there the lady said it was $72.00 when I asked why so much she said that they always charge $3.00 more for traditional wings, in all the years I'd been going I had never been told or charged that much, the cashier asked me if wanted the manager to explain it to me again, I'm not stupid, I don't need someone else to explain it to me, needless to say, we're not going back and I'll gladly go out of my way to detour others from going."}

{"text":"The food was really good. This particular location has too many staff working. All the employees were very loud including the manager. Was not properly greeted coming in or extending the restaurant. Would definitely recommend Barro's but would highly recommend Barro's training their stuff better and being more professional."}
{"text":"So glad to finally have a Barro's in this part of town.  Love their slice deals at lunch, what a steal.  Delivery is timely and friendly as well.  This location is probably the most attractive I've seen."}
{"text":"The pizza is one of my favorites.  They have the best ranch in Arizona.  I would come here more often if the staff was nicer."}
{"text":"Pizza is just okay.  Nice that hey deliver.  Quite expensive in my opinion.  Ordered thin crust and did not get it."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and wings. I go here all the time. Always fast and staff is very friendly! My only complaint is when I call in to order, Sarah isn't always the friendliest on the phone. I'm sure they get busy handling phones and customers, but you at least need to fake it. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"If you want good service wonderful excellent pizza and wings and beer this is a place to go"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza restaurant. I really like the marinara sauce they use on the pizza and the cheese is the best too! There is no need to drive across town to another restaurant for great pizza. And the service is fantastic! Thank you Barro's Pizza!"}
{"text":"We normally order to go at another location, but we were close to this one. It was a to go order but we walked in to order.  The service was friendly. Our thin crust pizza seemed thick and our mozzarella sticks were cold. I was genuinely disappointed. I ended up eating the top of the pizza and throwing the rest away. Oddly the food was colder when ordering in store than waiting for the food to arrive by delivery.  Unfortunately it was a one and done experience for us."}
{"text":"So salty. We ordered an XL pizza and it was so salty even the kids wouldn't eat it. The salad was full of white iceberg lettuce. Not impressed. Last time I try it here :("}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The first time we visited because they'd sent us a coupon for a free large pizza for being new to Litchfield Park. Awesome! We didn't mean to be \"those people,\"- the ones who show up within the last 20-30 minutes a restaurant is open, but we were. They were more than happy to get us our pizza, even though they weren't making any money (aside from the tip we left at the register) from us getting a free pizza to go. It was good pizza and so we went back.  Again, we didn't mean to be the kind of people to show up late, but we aren't ones for great timing. This time though, they'd be making money and we ordered two medium pizzas to go. Just as delicious! We got a White Pizza (the fiance says it isn't as good as Sal's Tuscan Grill, but he liked it) and a mushroom pizza.   We plan on going back during lunch time hours next time since ordering whole pizzas is a bit much for us."}
{"text":"This is exactly the type of neighborhood carryout type pizza I was looking for.  You order at the counter and get a number on a stick so they can find you when they deliver your food.  We had to catch a movie so we asked for our pizza in a box.  Their time estimation was on point and they didn't forget about the box.  We tried the Barro's special(?) which is basically like a supreme.  The crust was chewy yet crisp and the veggies didn't make the top part too watery.  I think it was pretty well executed overall.  I really was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to try some other items on the menu.  Their beer selection is decent and the prices are pretty good.  Lots of TVs there too, though I'm not sure they have the NFL package or anything.  It would be a great place to catch a game or go before/after a movie for sure."}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at Barro's in years but did last night.  Great surprise, can't remember why I didn't go back.  Good pizza and wings.  Will go again.  Try it, I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Good place for a cheap lunch that hits the spot, you can buy by the slice, or get 2 slices and a drink, a slice/salad/drink and so on.  They have a daily specialty pizza that you can get as well for a few cents extra.  I always seem to forget which slice goes with each day, but the buffalo chicken pizza rocks!"}
{"text":"The best takeout/delivery pizza in Phoenix. Forget Papa Johns or Pizza hut. If you are in delivery range or pick up distance to a Barro's you will not be disappointed. The quality of their meat and veggie's is fantastic. Feeling the pizza craving? This is your best bet.   The crust is not too thick, not too thin, soft but crunchy, (is that possible?) YES. They are not heavy handed on the sauce, but combine a perfect blend of topping, cheese and tomato sauce goodness. The true test of a good pizza is either plain cheese or good ole pepperoni. Both from Barro's are excellent. They are a family joint, local and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always like Barro's pizza n wings but this location is new to us. (We recently moved from Litchfield Park.) I know they're busy. It's a Saturday night. But looking around and counting all the dirty tables and booths (including ours!), there are 5 others that need attention. Probably won't be regulars here like we were at the Dysart/Camelback Barro's."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza.  Decent Prices.  Great place for kids.  They even offer a Gluten Free Pizza and a Gluten Free Beer!"}
{"text":"So, Arizona's Barro's has good pizza. And...like any good chain, it's consistently good. The best part about Barro's though is that it's a local chain. I love knowing that this is pizza one gets in AZ only.  I'm only out at Barro's during lunch breaks, but man am I grateful that this location is so close to the office. Their lunch special is one of the best around. For less than $5 I get a decently sized salad, a slice and a drink. Oh, and the sausage really tastes like the sausage that I'm used to from Chicago.  The reason I'm writing this review though is because of the service. At this particular location I always feel taken care of. The staff is super friendly and always pretty cheerful (not creepy cheerful like the Twilight Zone or anything). If you work or live around North Scottsdale, give this Barro's your business."}
{"text":"The line at Grimaldi's was too long so we headed for Barro's.  It's no Grimaldi's but the pizza sure was good, especially for the price and the fast and friendly service.  We ordered the thin crust pizza, extra crispy.  The crust was good and crispy.  We're from New York and this pizza was more than satisfactory.  The wings, served piping hot, were pretty good, too."}
{"text":"We've only ordered delivery,  never actually went to the restaurant. Service is quick, friendly and accurate. The white pizza is amazing! We'll continue to order their food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza around. We have ordered here a few times and each time it's good. The staff is friendly and my order is always correct. Can't really ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a meal here with my family.  Workers are always amazing and helpful.  One actually came out and assisted me when I dropped my phone under someone else's car!  Food is fantastic too"}
{"text":"I like the kids section.  The white pizza is good.  The wine and beer are super cheap.    Last time we ate there we saw a huge scorpion hiding on a rolled up rug behind a booth in the kids section.  Freaked me out.  The employee came over to take care of it with a handful of napkins!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wasn't even able to try the pizza due to the rude, condescending, tone of the woman to take my order. Being new to the area I googled the establishment and saw they had a coupon. When asking for the deal the lady rudely said \"we don't do that\" after explaining the coupon was online she said \"well like I just said we don't do that. It's not our coupon\" with hopes of getting at least an explanation I asked to speak with the manager. No better luck. Customer service just killed any chance of me ordering from here."}
{"text":"This pizza is packed with flavor. From the robust tomato sauce to the richness of the cheese and quality of the toppings, it's our family favorite. The pepperoni is always a hit and we also love the chicken hot wing pizza."}
{"text":"They have solid food specials; we got an extra large pizza and 24 wings for $20. The food is great too! The only problem I had there was that one of the wings (we ordered boneless) was raw. I don't mean undercooked, I mean crunchy raw. I know that this is probably just a one-off, but I can't overlook it; not with chicken.  Hopefully next time I go back they'll earn  a higher rating. Ultimately though, I would definitely recommend this place for pizza!"}
{"text":"Always great food but kind of a limited menu like no grinders.  The spaghetti and meatballs are new and very good, and the newest store on Cave Creek Rd is really nice."}
{"text":"Good location, lots of parking and lots of space.  Even a little play area for the kiddos.    I much prefer eating in because there is nothing better than a cheese pizza fresh out of the oven.  WOW.  Having to wait to eat it at home any pizza will lose that oven fresh perfection.  The wings are great and the pizza is pretty darn good, too.  They go a little heavy on the pizza sauce for my taste, but I will just remember to ask for light sauce next time.  The place is always busy on the weekends.  And expect to run into teams celebrating a win or licking their wounds for a loss.  But it is still a great atmosphere. And one I am hesitant to take my kid into."}
{"text":"Stopped in here several time to hang out with friends. Good for kids, decent service, decent atmosphere, reasonably priced beer($9 for a pitcher), The pizza is just ok in my opinion, I don't really care for new york style pizza, I prefer Chicago style pizza but it's not bad. Four Stars."}
{"text":"My family frequented this Barro's back when they were located off of 67th and Peoria. I remember when they were forced to move because the Peter Piper moved in right next door. Now, there are closer pizza joints, even another Barro's closer than this one to me, but this is the only one I will go to. My wife's family is large, and we choose to celebrate most birthdays here. They take reservations and set up the back area nicely so that we have room to celebrate, they even allow us to store ice cream in their freezer until we need it. Customer service is fantastic but I would still come if that was not the case, the strong point with them is the food. The pizza is great and the wings are the best in town. It should come as no surprise that my favorite pizza is the hot wing pizza, with the barbecue chicken pizza a close second. My wife loves the ham and pineapple and that is a great option also, but be sure to not skip on the wings (we usually ask for extra sauce so that I can dip the pizza in the excess)."}
{"text":"As a chain, this pizza joint has never disappointed me. The pizza is always good. The staff at every store I've been to has been courteous and attentive. The stores are always clean and well lit. One thing I have realized about ALL Barro's stores including this one is that, if you want it delivered, be prepared to wait. my place of employment is a mile and a half away and it is consistently a 45 minute delivery time. The store closest to my house is less than a mile down the road with the delivery times ranging from 45 minutes to an hour and a half...other than that, everything's great."}
{"text":"This pizza was so good!! The cheese breadsticks were huge and super cheesy. The original crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Had the Spicy Southwestern Barbecue Chicken and the all meat pizza. Both were super yummy!  You get a ton of food for the price!"}
{"text":"If you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, I highly recommend Barro's. Usually if a restaurant offers gluten free pizza crust, it is just that - the crust and only the crust is gluten free. It is still prepared on same equipment, cross-contamination, etc. not the case St Barro's! I've eaten their GF pizza MANY times, and have never once had an issue with gluten contamination. I'm unfortunately quite sensitive to even a little bit of cross contamination (which is extremely inconvenient), but Barro's has never been an issue for me at all. I don't know if they have a truly separate prep area or what, but whatever they are doing works.   Single bit of criticism - Barro's seriously needs to get on the online ordering bandwagon! Most of the other pizza places now offer that, which is very nice for people who don't want their order misunderstood. GF requests sometimes just don't always come across correctly via phone, and I really don't want to sit and wait for an order if I have to go in and order in person.   Overall though, keep up the good work Barros!"}
{"text":"Called in tonight to order a pizza and wings. Spoked to a young woman who was not paying attention the entire time. I had to repeat my order three times in order to place it. I went to pick up my food and the order was repeated back to me again correctly, I grabbed my food and went home. Once I got home I had found that that my order was completely wrong on the pizza portion. We are usually very pleased with Barro's and tonight was below our standards. I hope they get a new girl to take orders as the one that took mine tonight is not in the right position in my opinion within their organization.   The wings were correct and delicious as I've come to expect. Hopefully the service and attention to detail improves on our next visit."}
{"text":"I love Barros but this location is horrible. I placed an order over the phone for 12 wings and garlic bread. They told me 15 minutes. I arrived, paid, and they said it would be a few more minutes. 45 minutes later the gal asked what the name was again and realized my food had been sitting there the entire time. Her response.. \"Oops.\" My food was cold & disgusting. I didn't eat it. Will never be back."}
{"text":"I made my order through postmates and after some research the issue was with the app. The issue however is with the store manager and the reason for the poor rating for terrible customer service.   I called the store immediately after receiving the order as the cheese pizza had anchovies (which I have an allergy) and was transferred immediately to the manager. I had barely began to explain the issue and he said \"the issue isn't our problem, it's postmates. Call them.\" I tried to explain to him that I ordered a cheese pizza and he was brash, rude and incredibly dismissive. While the other edible pizza is good, I will NEVER order from here again as I expect better customer service especially from the manager. So ridiculously rude."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots of lunch. It's always very busy for lunch but still very quick. The lunch special is super cheap and the pizza is really great. They have tv's if you are into sports and also an area for kids to play games and stuff."}
{"text":"I pretty much grew up at this Barro's Pizza, so this rating carries a bit of misty-eyed nostalgia for my days in Moon Valley, the best neighborhood in Phoenix. I have so many memories of going here on a Friday or Saturday night with the fam, playing its pathetic little play area and arcade, and watching the Suns. Or from getting a two slice lunch special while hanging out at the now defunct card shop that used to be in this strip mall.   But at the same time, Barro's makes some amazing non-deep-dish Chicago pizza at some of the cheapest prices in the city. Even grown up, there isn't much more satisfying meals then getting a Large mushroom and black olive for 10 bux with some beer and going to town. The wings and bread sticks are also always a good call as well as the white pizza that some Barro's locations serve.  Now I almost go into withdrawals on Friday nights with local sports and I don't get my Barro's, which is often because for some reason they never decided to open a location downtown. What gives??? How does a Phoenix OG like Barro's never open a location in the city center? They need to rectify that as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This place drives me nuts.  The staff is so blase about their job and service.  Twice the have not honored the prices advertised on their menu.  First time was for specials on a separate board.  I was told it was passed time.  Okay, fine even though nothing states that.  Next time they charged me almost double what the menu listed as the price for beer.  When I questioned it I was told the prices had changed.  Um, don't you have to change the menu on the wall then to reflect that?    Have had the pizza, gluten free pizza, wings and ravioli.  They are all fine.  The cheese garlic bread and cookie dessert are my favorite menu items though.  I do like that they let any age order off the kids menu if you want a smaller meal with a drink."}
{"text":"I like to order the cheesy bread with toppings.  Huge and cheaper then a pizza plus I like the flavor better.  Love that it is large and has a place for the kids to play.  They offer gluten free pizza and beer for my husband so that is a huge bonus.  $2.50 for a glass of wine!  We drive around the mountain to get here."}
{"text":"Since our move to the valley from Nevada we have been on a search to find pizza and wings as good as our favorite location in Reno ( pizza plus ) this is definitely it. The pizza is so cheesy and the sauce is great. It is has a bit more crust than we like but the crust here is great too. They are always busy, even on week nights . So if you order for delivery it's usually about an hour. They also have great spaghetti and meatballs and ravioli if you want something other than pizza. The wings and the huge number of sauce choices are sooo good. Crispy on the outside while remaining extra juicy on the inside. We always order for delivery so I don't know anything about the dine in experience . The people who work there are always super polite and have never messed up our order."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with some coworkers. We all ordered a lunch special.  During lunch they sell pizza by the slice. I ordered a slice of pizza, a salad, and a fountain drink. The pizza is extremely good, the salad is pretty decent (considering this is a pizza place), and the fountain drink selection is pretty common. Next time I will skip the salad and get two slices of pizza instead. They keep the pizza in a heated rack, which is very fast and convenient.   Everyone seemed to have the same conclusion about this place. The price is very good considering the quality and quantity of food you receive.   I will be back, this is a great place to grab some lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ. Been to this location a lot of times and never disappointed.   We called for a delivery for the first time the other day, and 40 minutes after placing the order we still did not have it. Not sure where the communication break down occurred, but when we called back to see what the delay was, they told us they had it listed as a pick up and it would be another 40 minutes for the delivery. It was a monday and right around prime dinner time hours, so I understand the delay. But given the circumstances, I wish they would have been more accommodating. Like I said, I've been here enough times that the lunch lady knows me by name and this was the first bad experience. Food is always amazing and delicious, which is why I'm still giving a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Called the second they opened to place a very large order for same day delivery, and was skeptical it would be accepted. They were able to accommodate and even delivered 10-15 minutes earlier than they promised.   The guy who took the order, John, was so easy to talk to and it was probably the easiest order I've ever made. He didn't sound like a robot or annoyed.   The delivery guy, Italian, didn't get his name, was just as pleasant. Even while unloading his car of 14 pizzas and 6 boxes of wings in 105 degree heat, he was still pretty nice and made sure I had a copy of my receipt.   The food was delicious as always! Never disappointed with Barro's."}
{"text":"Moon Valley.. I love you since moving out of the Biltmore area and heading North with my one and only:-) I have found some really great pizza places since moving here.. BUT Barros is by far.. the best.. The service at this particular Barros was awesome.. I had mistakenly called the wrong Barros for pick up.. My friend gets here and gives me that, 'wth look'.. well.. I wasnt sure of the addy, thats my excuse and Im sticking to it.. The cashier was awesome.. she said basically not to worry.. smiling.. and called in our order.. called the wrong Barros and canceled the other.. 8 minutes later.. we had a fresh, piping hot bomb pizza and a dozen wings.. life is good..now I know my friends addy and location to order from too."}
{"text":"Not only do they have good pizza they have good gluten free pizza which is hard to find, makes going out much easier for families who need to have that gluten free menu."}
{"text":"We had a cancelled flight so had stay the night at a relatives.  Saw good yelp reviews about this place decided to order large Barro special and dozen hot honey wings.  After almost an hour we called and asked what was taking our delivery order so long.  About 5 min later food arrived.    Food was worth the wait.  Pizza had plenty fresh toppings and wings were awesome.  Sauce could have spicier but other than that it was perfect. Definitely will order again if we ever in town that is."}
{"text":"Just experienced the worse customer service I have ever had here. It's a shame because I live in moon Valley and have never had a bad experience. Really too bad."}
{"text":"Cheap wine- $2.50 a glass.  Good as long as the bottle they pour from hasn't been sitting open to long.  The pizza is edible.  I like the white pizza.  Also, I recommend a thin crust.  Good, easy, reasonably priced family restaurant."}
{"text":"I love barros! I have been ordering delivery from the location on coral gables for years and I'm never disappointed! The pizza is awesome as well as the salad and wings. The staff is always super nice and get my order quickly! I've heard they have great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh. We always do delivery and most of the time it's hot but there has been a few where it's only warm. The salad is good also just a bit pricey. But overall would recommend to others"}
{"text":"we really like Barro's.  This one was initially hard to tie down because of a wrong phone number, but the one listed here is correct.   Reliably good, pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I love barro's! I usually take out but today my family ate in and the pizza was SO delicious omg I want some now just thinking about it. The only thing I would say is it took a while to get it and it wasn't that busy. Two families got their large pizzas before ours even though they came after us. I love barro's though."}
{"text":"Short and easy review. Place is clean, service is friendly, environment is relaxed and cool. They have a decent build your own salad bar. Fountian machine for soda.  Short wait times for pizza/wings. I order their hot wing pizza, and have heard their white pizza is amazing. Boom. On my way right now to meet my family here for lunch."}
{"text":"Pizza it about the same price as pizza hut, but you get a larger pizza and better taste. I get the special the x-large pizza and 24 wings for 23 bucks."}
{"text":"Every Saturday is Pizza night, our choice is Barro's without a doubt. They answer phone very politely and they are efficient. I usually order for pick up and I have had nothing but excellent customer service from them from the phone to the store. Their pizza is so good and I love the antipasto salad.  I am glad they moved closer to our house! I highly recommend Barro's,"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Barro's! We had a very large order for them first thing in the morning. 20+ pizzas, 10+ cinnamon bread sticks, 7+ dozen wings. Ordering was easy and smooth. They followed up with me the next day and weren't frustrated at all when I had to add some more to the order an hour before the delivery. Michael, the delivery guy, was pleasant and patient while I was running around trying to get things set up. Jade and Erin were easy to talk to on the phone and made sure the order was correct. We're definitely calling them again for future orders."}
{"text":"Third time ordering delivery; kids pasta portion is huge! However, they must've been super busy as they forgot the ranch/blue cheese & celery that is supposed to come with the wings :/"}
{"text":"Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places."}
{"text":"I'm a little bias, being from the north east. But, this is normal local chain pizza. Nothing exciting about. It's good. Most pizza is. It's rear to find horrible pizza. Phoenix has a ton of pizza places to choose from. All mimicking east coast pizza. This is a good place, but you socks won't be knocked off."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2 because it's really my 1st bad experience with Barro's. I've been going to a Barro's for almost 15 years. My high school had it delivered at lunchtime. Use to go to one in Mesa when I lived there. When we moved to Gilbert was happy they where down the street. Anyways last night we ordered Chicken wings a cheese pizza, a mushroom,black olives, bell pepper pizza. The mushroom pizza was under cook. But both pizza gave my whole family diarhea. My husband was the only one to eat the chicken wings and he was throwing up about 2 hrs after he ate the. I've never had a problem with their food before so hopefully it's a one time thing."}
{"text":"I love Barro's. Great pizza. Great wings. Great prices. But today is the 3rd time I've been here that they have had nasty lettuce at the salad bar. Nobody cares that it comes packaged ready to use. Take a minute to pull that nasty stuff out! The staff is great but they need to learn that you can't use the same mildewy rag on the table that you use on the chairs. Straighten up guys. You're getting sloppy."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza delivered on time, fresh, hot and way delicious!!! Thank you Barro's team for helping us make  my grandma's 94th birthday the best she has ever had. All our guests loved your pizza!"}
{"text":"The all meat pizza was loaded with toppings, the cheese was so plentiful it was stretchy as we pulled apart slices, and the crust was a great texture. Added a bit of crushed red pepper to give it the kick I like. 3 slices was more than enough to fill, but I had to go in for the third!"}
{"text":"We generally love Barro's but tonight was the last time we will ever eat there. The club sandwich we had was fair with dry meats and wilted lettuce. The chicken pizza was flavorless. On top of it all, there was a controversial political sign on the counter. Huge turn off! Why do businesses feel they must pick a political side and push it on their patrons??? Bye Barro's!"}
{"text":"We called in a phone order and was told the order would be ready in 30 mins. When I arrived to pick up the order, they had only made half of what we ordered. They said they would male what was left right away and only charge me for one  Of the 2 pizzas for my inconvenience.  I paid in sat in the waiting area for my food to be done and was then told that painting me to pay for all of my order before they would make the pizza that they had neglected to make at this point.  I'm not mind paying for all of my food but it was very unprofessional for them to say they were going to come me one of the pizzas for my inconvenience and then tell me in order for them to make my food I had to pay for it additionally all of the wait staff work Louis unfriendly and did not seem to know what they were doing I have ate at affiliated restaurants throughout the years and after tonight's experience I will likely find a new place for pizza and wings"}
{"text":"My husband have eaten here once a week for about 3 months. They have only got our order wrong once and kindly corrected their mistakes. The staff is very friendly over the phone and in person. The pizza is delicious and my husband loves the wings."}
{"text":"Honestly worst customer service. Waited outside for them to open the doors this morning and order a pizza for my pregnant wife. When 1105 comes around in getting impatient. But I can wait a bit longer. 1115 ok this is not ok now, called the store asked if they were open the girl on the phone said of course they are. I hang up and go inside and ask why they didn't let me know if they could see me waiting outside that the doors were open. She said, they're always open and it says right on the door we open at 11... Giving me a look like I was stupid. So I asked her, wouldn't it be courteous to let your guest know they can come inside? She said I guess so. Point being I love the pizza here, but bad customer service can KILL your customers experience quicker than almost anything. I am a restaurant owner myself and I would be coaching these school girls on how to speak to guests politely and apologetically. Even though it's not their fault, the customer should come first in any business. I paid full price for my meal 2 pizzas and took it home to my starving wife with morning sickness, and Ho was less than thrilled that it took me an hour and a half to go grab food. Better training methods are definitely needed in this location or more mature cashiers."}
{"text":"I just love Barro's Pizza, and I am not just talking about this location. I have been to about 6 different locations and they stay constant which is not always the case with other places.   The food is always fresh and I have never had a pizza or wings that I would have sent back to the kitchen. The breadsticks are soft and taste really good with the cheese and garlic on top of it. The pizza sauce taste great on everything including the breadsticks. The hot wings come in bone in and boneless fashion and both are just as good as the other.  The Environment differs a little from location to location as far as the number for Tvs for the adults but there is always sports playing so go here to watch the game. I also love that each location has a play area for the kids and their own Tv playing cartoons or movies. It includes a play kitchen and legos. It also has a few games for them to play and pass time while the adults finish their meal.   There is often specials that are sent in the mail where you can get an X-Large pizza and 24 hot wings for about 23 dollars. If you dont get the coupon just ask for the special and say you read about it on Yelp :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a long standing debate over this place. She has held for years that it's the best of the non-gourmet, non-specialty pizza joints. I think I'm finally ready to admit that she was right.  Barro's offers your standard pizza options for the standard prices, the difference is really in the quality. Every aspect of the pizza is done exceptionally well here. The crust is thin, but not too thin, delicious, crispy, hearty,  just a little chewy. They don't skimp on the toppings either, giving you plenty of cheese and loading it up with goodies. The sauce is tomatoey, sweet, and savory with spices. Despite all the cheese, the slices are never greasy and even the pepperoni gets crisped up nicely in the oven. For a standard pepperoni pizza, Barro's really is the best. Their toppings are always fresh and generously doled out, especially when it comes to the veggies. No paper-thin mushrooms or tiny dried out olives here.  The wings here, which are usually forgettable at other pizzerias, are actually damn good. The chicken is real, juicy, and tender, not overly breaded, and absolutely drowning in buffalo sauce. Plus, they usually way over-deliver on the quantity. Last time I ordered 24 boneless wings, I got closer to 40. The only downside is that they don't really have a hot flavor that is actually hot.   I've been eating here since about 1996, and it's only gotten better over time."}
{"text":"Been here twice since moving to Surprise. Pizza and ravioli were great. Can't wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night. First of all, the staff was GREAT! The cooks behind the counter greeted me first, and the cashier arrived right after. The pizza itself was excellent, although my one complaint would be that it is not the \"Chicago style\" that I was thinking (3 inches thick with the sauce on top). What they had was more of a pan style. Still, it was really good. A large was plenty for two of us and leftovers for lunch the next day. It was blessedly quiet on a Tuesday night, which was nice after a stressful day."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and their pies are consistently consistent and tasty, especially if you like pizza with a thicker crust. I moved out of state, but when I come home to visit I always stop by for lunch special by-the-slice if my family doesn't order Barro's on the weekend!"}
{"text":"We come to Barro's Pizza in Surprise at least 2 times a month. The pizza is great and extremely consistent. Their dough, cheese, and sauce is definitely primo! It is a very family friendly place although it is a bit pricier than other pizza places...but it is worth it. I would definitely suggest the original crust cheese pizza and the medium boneless wings. The wing sauce is awesome!  If you are looking for a great lunch spot as well, Barro's is great. Everyday until 4pm they have slices of pizza for $1.75. As well as a speciality pizza of the day. Saturdays is Kona and that is hands down my favorite pizza they make! Today my husband and I got 3 slices of pizza, a salad, and a large drink for $9.00. That is a great deal for 2 people.  I didn't give Barro's five stars because their delivery times and service needs some work. Their delivery times are never under an hour and the couple of times we did order delivery our order was wrong and cold. So if you want hot pizza and hot wings I would definitely suggest dining in."}
{"text":"We have been frequent diners for years never \"complained\"... until today. Hannah, after multiple times correcting her while placing our (very simple) to-go order. We ended up with alas the wrong items. When I called in to let them know, she rudely questioned me and attempted to blame me for her mistakes. When transferring phone to manager she must not have put the phone on hold so I was able to hear her conversation with the manager Dale. Both were unprofessional and rude. Zero attempt was made to fix our order. They just said they'd have to come  back and pick up our food so the meal was ruined, with zero attempt at fixing. Just condescending behavior. Never experienced this level of unprofessionalism or disregard for a (former) loyal and frequent customer."}
{"text":"Always love a pizza and salad from Barros. The food quality has always been great but the service provided by their younger staff members could be better.. Some of the employees look straight out of high school and need to work on their attitudes.  Ordered food from the wrong location last night, and the manager took care of rushing the order as well as canceling the order with the other store. Props to him!"}
{"text":"I Seriously love all their specialty pizzas here!  I would love to give this place 5 stars but the biggest issue with this location is how swamped it is. We went on a Wednesday and the place was overrun with children everywhere. There is a play area to the side but it is so loud that we took our pizza to go.   The staff seemed disinterested in being there but the food was perfect. I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and the toppings were perfect. The sauce didn't overwhelm the pizza and the cheese they use is delightful. Plus the chicken was still moist, not dry like a lot of places.   I'll keep getting pizza here but it will always be to go."}
{"text":"This location falls a little short of the 51st ave Barros.  Pizza is good and service is nice with the ladies who work the front register.  For some reason, cannot pinpoint the pizza just isn't as good as the 51st ave location."}
{"text":"I love their gluten free pizza crust! They also have really yummy hot wings. I wish their prices were a little bit less, but I guess it is worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great prices, cold beer and a really nice group room in the back where large groups can hang out, watch sports on the big screens, and let the kids run around. Love this place."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza for me!!! Yay! We order from Barro's pretty frequently now that we know they have gluten free pizza and you can basically build your pizza to your liking. The caveat is that with gluten free, as with alot of places, its more expensive. So much for having an allergy and not going broke! However, I have learned that gluten free pizzas have to be cooked seperately. Hence the reason you get only a 10in pizza instead of being able to order the fat butt American large marge size. I love the crispy crust, also. However, Barro's has been soggy on the crust at times, and we have since found another source for gluten free splurges. And don't expect any coupons or deals on gluten free pizza here.."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled to see Barro's Pizza opening in my area! First i have to say I grew up eating Red Devil Pizza on 30th str McDowell and my all time favorite BUT this is & always has been my 2nd favorite place for pizza & salads! Great deals on lunch specials! Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of you traditional American style pizza but the kids are. That being said, I don't expect much more than a lot of bread, cheese and bland, jarred sauce from most chain pizza joints. Barros delivered on that aspect, bleh. Our last visit however left me nauseous & annoyed.   As I waited in the car, my husband ran inside to pick up our pizzas to bring home. An employee, still w his dirty apron on walked out of the establishment coughing & gagging. A delivery kid passed him on the sidewalk in fro t of our car. During their quick exchange the gagging employee stated loud enough for me to hear through my closed windows that he \"had just gotten through throwing up 5 times & felt like shit.\" Then he proceeded to cough, gag & spit right in front of my car.   Wow. Attempting to understand the facts that a. Everyone gets sick & b. We're talking about minimum wage workers here I went into confront the management and check on the state of the food we were bringing home to our children. The manager acknowledged the sick employee & assured us he had not prepared our pizza. I doubt he had not had any contact w food or food prep items in the closet spaced area.   I will not be ordering from Barros again. Or eating anything at all any time soon."}
{"text":"This barros is terrible compared to 40th st and greenway, and the 51st ave and union locations. There was pretty much nobody there and my pizza wasn't ready until 10 later than the quoted pick up time. Also, my pizza had no sauce. Ok, there was enough sauce to give the dough under the cheese a slight orange tint. You couldn't taste it though. Dry pizza. And I actually hate sauce, and tomatoes, and end up scraping off a little sauce when I eat regular pizzas. So that says a lot coming from me. Also, the crust was not typical barros  wonderful and fluffy. It tasted and looked like  Digorno frozen pizza crust. Dissapointing all around. I will drive to a different location next time"}
{"text":"My paper napkins were falling apart in my hands because of how much grease was coming off of the pizza."}
{"text":"My wallet was found outside the restaurant which was wonderful news. It fell out when packing up my stroller with my two kids. I called to see if it was found. Then the time it took me to drive over there $20 cash was taken out by an employee and no one seemed to care when I talked to a manager. I probably would have given the $20 as a finders fee."}
{"text":"Saturday night after a long day of being in the sun we ordered pizza, I had a quick errand to run so I chose pickup instead of delivery. I've never been to Barro's before and was just hoping it would taste better than Papa Johns and somewhat close to Spinato's because that's our go-to place in the area.   When I went to pick up the pizzas there was an issue but it was 100% my fault in my opinion, I didn't clarify my order when I placed it. The girl behind the counter politely disagreed, stated if the person who took the order had followed up with questions it would have been made correctly. I thought that was awesome and she even offered to remake them. No need, I have hungry folks at my house and need to get home. But, she did discount my pizzas to apologize for the error and I thought that was more than generous.   I also took a large salad to go. I LOVE THAT I CAN MAKE MY OWN SALAD. I like 5 pounds of mushrooms on a salad and I was able to do that. I would have been in a long time ago if I knew about this DIY side salad.   The customer service alone deserves 5 stars. I walked in the house and made the statement, even if the pizza is gross, I'm still going back!! But, it wasn't gross at all. It was fantastic!! If I had ordered it correctly it would have been a thin crust, so I can't be mad at all the extra dough. But, spot on.   I am certain the next time we need a pizza to do, we will be calling this place first. The prices are fair, the customer service is good and it's pretty darn tasty!!"}
{"text":"For the second time,  this place made mistakes in taking orders and giving the correct foods in timely manner. Even worse,  when the mistakes are made, the workers don't know how to apology and fix the problem unless the manager is involved. I'm not going back there again."}
{"text":"I hear the pizzas are good. Too bad the person answering the phone couldn't take down my address correctly. After the third time spelling the address, telling her the cross streets and the name of the development (plus 4 holds) I just gave up.  Easier to call Amalfi and drive over and pick up a pizza, than get frustrated on the phone. Might try again when I have lots of time for a phone call or if someone answers the phone that can take an order."}
{"text":"Food is good but I tried to call ahead for two antipasti salads.  They put me on hold I waited about 6 mins decided it would be quicker to just go in.   Boy was I wrong. waited in line forever only 2 cashiers for lunch & they are crazy busy. Finally ordered then waited about 30 mins for SALAD.. everyone getting slices and moving on.. don't go there for lunch if your in a hurry.. They have 4 or 5 registers but only two people.. then on top of that I'm gluten free told them no croutons but found 3 in my salad.."}
{"text":"Barros megameats is our go to pizza. They do a good job of loading up the pizza. They do a good job on the wings too (be sure to have them run the through twice). Service is always slow & they need to work on the customer service training for the girls that answer the phones. They seem to not give a $#it about the customer."}
{"text":"I call and the order is normally ready in 20 minutes. Normally, I order a large Barrows special thin crust and it is a great pizza...Sometimes my wife and I will eat at Barro's and we will have a pitcher of beer. The service and quality are normally excellent..."}
{"text":"I normally love barros but this location sucks. We ordered a large pizza and it took over an hour and it was cold. When I emailed to tell them, they offered to replace it. So I placed a to go order along with 24 wings and a large salad and get there to find out I was supposed to print the email and they wanted me to pay full price! I would go to another location then this one."}
{"text":"Ordered 20min to closing and guy on the line was very polite. Even delivered to the Cibola Vista resort where we were staying and even knew to ask for what building we were at.  Pizza was great! Glad i made the decision over domino's and pizza hut. Dough tasted fresh and ingredients were awesome. I didn't have menu in front of me and person the phone recommended mega meat because i asked for something meaty."}
{"text":"Frequently order pizza here and occasionally go in to dine. Pizza is always great and I absolutely love their lunch specials! They are one of the few places you can go in to get just a slice of pizza at a super low price. I am kot a fan of their original crust but love their thin crust! Wish they would inclide that in lunch specials.  Customer service is a hit or miss. They typically have young girls some whom are gery sweet and others who have an attitude. I had just called to order pizza for lunch and felt as though I had some how interrupted the girl who took my order.  Good thing I love the pizza here or I probably would have hung up and ordered from somewhere else. Their delivery times tend to be a bit slower than some of the other pizza places. 45 minutes to an hour even though they just opened. I expect that during friday and Saturday nights but seems a big long for Friday right when they open."}
{"text":"This is my top 5 pizza places in all of Phoenix. It's just my kind of pizza. The ingredients and always top notch. It's nice inside and the staff is always nice. I get meat lovers pizza and it's great!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. It's one of my top pizza places in AZ. I got the lunch special today and the pizza isn't quite as good as when it's made fresh but still top notch. It's nice inside as well with comfy seats and lots of TVs. The only bad thing is it's got coke instead of Pepsi but I don't drink much soda anyway."}
{"text":"We have had multiple order errors from this barros and tonight was the last. Ordered delivery over two hours ago and the food was a no show. There are too many good pizza joints in the area to continue ordering from here"}
{"text":"I travel all over the US and have had all of the top pizza joints around. You can't compare this to pizzeria bianco because this is accesible to everyone In The valley and they deliver. It is the best pizza for the price bar none. I have had all the newyork and Chicago greats and this is right up there with them."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  They shorted out order.  Mistakes happen, but they weren't even apologetic. Very disappointing. We will not come back."}
{"text":"Great service here.  Staff is always smiling and very helpful.  I think their pizza is one of the best around.  Always consistently made well with lots of toppings on my pie.  Place is clean and parking is not too bad.  Their wings are good too; ask for extra crispy.  Hate soggy wings!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Barros!! Been coming here for years, dine in, pick up or delivery. It has always been fast and delicious! The staff is always polite and credit and make sure I have all that I need. It is a little bit more pricey than others but I know here everything is fresh and taste better. Recommended by me 100%!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel nearby, placed it to go order. They got almost every single detail of the order wrong, it's just pizza and wings I don't see how difficult it could be. They closed early due to the holidays so we were stuck with what they brought. May not be a big deal, but when you have three small kids that care about every detail it is a big deal. They completely failed at a simple job, won't order from here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the lunch specials that Barro's offers!! A few negatives....don't put my order on a dirty tray....2:13pm 12 dirty tables...hire more people or train staff to clean tables in between customers...lastly please don't reach on the inside of the cup with your fingers....common sense food handling skills...hope the Mgr takes note and makes changes...this will not prevent me from coming back but will note changes. Pizza, salad and drink were good!"}
{"text":"My bf and I ordered a veggie pizza with hot wings. We were told it was going to take 45 minutes to an hour for delivery. Our food arrived in about 30 minutes. Quite surprise but it was better for us of course! The pizza was very delicious and filling! The hot wings were cooked well and had a nice hint of spice. Peep the photo :)"}
{"text":"Great location and excellent food every time. We had the Barros special, spaghetti and meatballs, wings and a salad! Ate every morsel of this wonderful feast. Will be back for more in March."}
{"text":"A friend suggested Barros for lunch and decided to try it. They have plenty of lunch specials and I opted for #7 which was 3 slices of pizza and a drink. I added a small salad and paid $9 ish bucks not bad for a lunch meal for myself and two toddlers. The slices are huge! They were busy for lunch that day and was surprised as to how small the dinning area is. But then as we looked for the bathroom to wash hands I was escorted to the left of entrance door and there was a hidden dinning area on that side. Neat! My only complaint about my experience is that when I walked through their small salad bar most of the bins were empty. I went back to check on some of the toppings and they hadn't gotten refilled. Other than that I was very happy about the value, good quality food, customer service-everyone of their employees smiled! We will definitely be back for lunch service."}
{"text":"I'm visiting AZ and I came to this pizza place. The Pizza and the hot wings were  amazing. Very delicious.  I enjoyed every  bite. And they also have daily specials"}
{"text":"The pizza is great, menu says Chicago style.  They use plenty of cheese and the crust is perfectly thick and fluffy.  The italian sausage is chunky and flavorful.  The chicken wings are also great, they use Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Lunch is a great deal with two slices and a drink for $5, they also offer salads for lunch, although I've never partaken.  The only drawback is is the cramped strip mall feel of the restaurant.  However, I love eating their pizza, when I'm not on a health kick."}
{"text":"Second best place to grab a slice of pizza, if the first was Chicago. Great place, always with a friendly staff, wings, beer, wings.. Lots of sauce and cheese. They could use better ranch, I don't think they understand our southwest passion for ranch yet. Sometimes it can be very watery.."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong I love the food at Barros pizza. I've been going here since back in high school. But I just can't get over the fact that when I ordered delivery the driver forgot my 2 liter. Not a big deal when I was told that they would go get it and bring it back. The problem was they never brought it back and when I called I was told they had just left and would be there to drop it off soon. Again they never showed. Even though I was offered a free 2 liter by the manager, I'm still super mad about the fact that I paid for something and they didn't even give it too me then lied to me about it. I won't be calling for delivery ever again. I've never had an issue with any other pizza place not delivering what I've paid for."}
{"text":"Worst Barros I have ever been to.  Water all over the bathroom floor from a leaking toilet.  The employees were not prompt about its cleanup or even putting a sign up to prevent someone from slipping.  Fountain drink machine was out of ice for an extended period of time.  Ordered two flavors of wings and the waitress did not tell us which flavor was hot or mild.  Come to think of it, the waitress didn't say anything at all.  The pizza was as sloppy as this establishment.  Overall terrible experience at this location.  There were a ton of employees and the restaurant was empty.  Not sure what the issue was here."}
{"text":"Barros special pizza is the best. Crust is delicious. The Wings are big and meaty. I never liked wings before but these wings are fully cooked and not dried. I would highly recommend. The seating is kinda weird like a maze lol"}
{"text":"Barron's has been our pizza joint for years!!  The pizza has not changed in the last 15 years & is great. The boneless wings are mouthwatering, we always order both & they show up within the allotted amount of time. Support your local pizza joint & order from them!"}
{"text":"The best pizza ever!  This has been the place to go since high school (long time ago) and still my favorite! I love there lunch specials, great value. I love that they are expanding there locations. The service is great."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night, the 30th of January with the hubby.   We were in the mood for wings and found this place on Yelp.   Tucked into a little shopping center we arrived and went in. Very busy place. We order a Large Barro's special and a dozen fire wings and a dozen Honey Bbq wings...  The wings were delish!!! I love when they are fried and then sauced. Makes them so crunchy and sticky. I will give them two thumbs up on the wings!   Our pizza was good, nothing to write home to mom about but it did have thick crust and was yummy.   If you can put up with this place being kind of dirty and the fact that it is young kids running this place and goofing off in front of you. I would for sure give it a try..."}
{"text":"Being from Boston its tough to find good pizza.Funny , me and the rugrats went to the Surprise pool and and the kids said dad can we get something to eat and we were antiicipatng the worst at the snack shop and to our disbelief it was delicious, I asked did u make this and the kid said no its Barros!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place has good pizza, they seem to always deliver fast and their food is consistently good. They are my local pizza place (now a local chain), and I started going there like 30 years ago, and I'm still happy to eat their pizza! Way better than like any big corporate pizza. Good crust, classic American pizza. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I like the thin crust pizza and salad bar. Good prices for food."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! I usually get just a cheese pizza from here but my husband likes to get the wings (extra crispy!!). I think we are regulars at Barro's now because we keep going back lol. The pizza isn't too thin and it's not deep dish but the doughy-ness is perfect!"}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free option! The staff was very friendly - I was greeted when I walked in and others were thanked as they left. No complaints, delicious food and friendly staff... this is why I go out to eat!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza everytime I come.  Cheaper than Papa John's and Pizza Hut.  Plus they support the local schools."}
{"text":"After trying a local competitor we found Barro's to be the best.  Flavorful wings and delicious pizza.  And, delivers on time !!!!"}
{"text":"Cut my leg on a table piece that was absolutely out of sight (nobodys fault) and notified the manager. He was quick to be very concerned about my leg and fixed the table while ensuring that the remainder of our experience was exceptional. We were very pleased with his customer service and ability to turn our perception around. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great here.  Always run into someone we know - glad to finally have a dinner place at Pavilions.  Prices are reasonable, and staff is mostly friendly.  Definitely a place that we frequent now."}
{"text":"So, I like Barro's and order from the on a semi-regular basis.  I like their spaghetti.  It's simple and good, and the portions are large enough for two meals.  I've packed up my silverware or, donated it all for reasons I won't trouble anybody with.  Suffice it to say, i have none and so, on two separate occasions, called and specifically asked that they please, please, please send silverware with the spaghetti I'd ordered.  Both times, I was assured that they would throw the silverware in the bag.  Neither time, was there silverware in the bag.  They'd simply blown my calls off.  Both times I called back and spoke with the manager and all I got was an apology.  No, \"What can I do to make it right?\"  No, \"what can we do to make sure you order again and keep your business?\"  Nothing.  He never seemed genuinely sorry that they'd screwed up.  Is it practice at Barro's to send delivery orders out without silverware?  Guess so.  How in the hell, though, is anybody supposed to eat spaghetti and a salad, without silverware?  What if I'd had this delivered to a place of business, that didn't have silverware on hand.  So, Baro's will never get another order from me.  I won't set foot in another one of your restaurants ever again, and I will tell my friends about your horrible customer service, about how your delivery boy tried to skate out on me before I could check to make sure there was silverware in the bag, about how, when said delivery boy got here, he didn't want to come to my door and so, I had to come out to him to get my food which, I might add, he'd been transporting in his damn TRUNK!  No more. I won't pay for this anymore.  I'm learning that, in this day and age, customer service means nothing.  Don't worry, Barro's.  You're not the only ones doing it wrong..."}
{"text":"Multiple Cockroaches found at my booth.... The small German Brown kind. Never again."}
{"text":"Just moved to Laveen and was looking for just salad and wings. I was reading reviews about Native New Yorker ( which weren't very good) so we tried this place. It wasn't busy so we ordered right away, was very spacious and tables were nice. We ordered salad and came out within 5 minutes, the wings came out just as we finished salad. Everything was very tasty. Will be back again"}
{"text":"I like the prices of the Lunch menu, perfect for the days you don't have much time but need some food. $6 for 2 Slices, a salad, and a drink.   I've ordered Barro's many times throughout my life and am always happy with the flavors of the dough, sauce, and toppings."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this pizza! I have never had a problem with takeout or delivery. Each time the pizza was ready as promised, even delivered earlier than quoted. I usually get a regular pep and cheese, but have tried the gluten free as well. Never had a bad pizza or problems with customer service. They are very busy on the weekends, you just need to plan ahead. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh how we've missed good pizza. We lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and good pizza was hard to come by. We always order from this Barros and we've always had excellent service, pizza has always been fresh and hot. We're not a fan of their wings but we love their pizza. The cheese bread is a hit in our house as well."}
{"text":"Took a chance and stopped at this Barros my original place is on thunderbird I regret it!! Cashier was rude asf once you get that nasty attitude walking in and having them take your order in a rude matter you can't enjoy your stay there and can't help NOT coming back to this location. (No name tag on the cashier)"}
{"text":"Pizza with sauce on the side does not quite have the ring that cheesy bread has to it.   We were hanging out by the pool in N Scottsdale and we needed some gluttonous food to go with beer at the swim up bar. Google suggested we call Barro's and that is just what we did.  2 orders of cheesy bread and one pizza. The cheese bread went fast too. It is essentially a pizza with the sauce on the side and cut into handy strips. Yes it was greasy, garlicky and doughy, that is what made it so good.  Delivery was fast and the food was hot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Barro's location.  The pizzas are always good, and the breadsticks with cheese are amazing.  Unlike the Barro's location on 67th, this location always has the food ready when promised.  I don't recommend the garlic bread, but everything else I've ever tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my review, unfortunately I am changing my 4 star review to 2 stars.  I would still rate their pizza and customer service at 5 out of 5, but they ALWAYS make me wait longer than they say.  Every time they say 15, it's 20+.  If they say 20, it's 30+ minutes.  I love their food, but if it's going to take 35 minutes(my current wait time), don't tell me 20. Luckily I'm moving, so now I can go to a new Barro's.    Last Review From 10/27/15 Best pizza in town.  Great customer service, with one exception.  Whenever we order to pick up, it always takes longer than they say it will so we end up waiting for our pizza.  The pizza and customer service are so good it's always worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch here with my son.  Sell pizza by the slice so there was no real wait time.  They have slice combos which are pretty cheap.    We also ordered a dozen wings.  This was plenty for both of us.  The wings were good and big."}
{"text":"Great Pizza,Best Meatball Sandwich,Good Prices. Staff Super friendly,Aaron the manager was great very helpful and kind,Also the girl that took our order on Sunday beautiful smile.Most definitely coming back to this Location!"}
{"text":"The best pizza!!!!  They have consistent quality and a great tasting product!"}
{"text":"We have eaten pizza from here many times before & it was always good, But last Saturday night after eating the Veggie pizza 6 hrs. later we came down with severe food poisoning !!  just now 3 days later we are getting back to normal, no I did not call & complain because I'm sure the reply would be we didn't get any other complaints, why would they open themselves up to liability. We won't be eating there any longer too bad because their food always tasted good but I'm not going to chance it ."}
{"text":"i don't order here very often because of the price/my paycheck, but these guys are awesome! if you want an extremely great pizza, and can afford it, this is the best pizza that you can buy! i always buy their \"barros special\" and its always - exactly the same  as it was the time it was ordered before!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch deals. Love that they have a salad bar and I don't have to have pizza on days when I am trying to eat a little healthier."}
{"text":"Called store for delivery and was placed on hold for a good 5+ minutes. The girl came on and apologize a few times for the long wait. She said \"I'm not trying to make up in excuse but we were having issues with are computer. I am so sorry she was very friendly and helpful as a matter of fact she saved me money by letting me know about there special they had. As she was taking my order the computer went down again she was very embarrassed and had to start all over again after entering my order she asked me if she could please put me on hold. She came back in a few minutes and asked if we like bread sticks I told her we had not had them from there that I just needed the pizzas she said for all the trouble and the long wait we would like to send you out an order on us. I told her it was not her fault and it was okay. She then said joking well I put it in the computer already and I for get how to take it out laughing..I thanked her and she gave me my total and the delivery time of 45 minutes. I asked if I pick it up would it be any faster and she said yes I debated about just going there since it was only a 3 miles away. Once again she said let me check something hold on she came back and said well it should only be about 25-30 minutes we have another delivery on your street so we can send them out together. When my pizzas arrived in about 30 minutes they were nice and hot the driver was very out going and friendly. I got in side and the manager wrote on the ticket that he was very sorry about the computer issues and hopes everything is good that was nice I open the bag and they sent 2 orders of bread sticks with ranch. This is great service and we will be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Been going here over 20 years.  Very good pizza that won't break the bank.  Wings are very good too.  Always get good service too.  And when I do take out the pizza is always ready when they say."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say, I have been eating at Barros for a long time now and this location is probably my favorite. It became a weekly Thursday tradition for my family to come here - they could take my order before I even spoke it.  The pizza is very good. Honestly, there is not anything that overwhelmingly special about it. It's just a great tasting and simple pie. And the consistency is exactly the same each visit.  Unfortunately, it's been a little while since my last visit, but the service was absolutely top-notch considering it's a pizza joint and they simply bring your order to your table when ready. And considering the staff was very young overall, they still managed to come around and ask us how the food was and how we were doing, but it wasn't forced, it seemed very genuine.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back... tomorrow methinks!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry,  but the fact is that the smell of sewer permeating the dining area is just to much to say we had a pleasant first experience here.   The pizza may be good but the smell put a damper of the excellent pizza & wings we ordered.  The wings were your standard hot wing and the meat was a bit tough; and I'm not sure why that is.  I guess I'd order them again and see if it was just that particular batch.  I would order to-go till they have that whole hellishous fragrance problem under control.  The young lady taking our order must have taken offense when asked about it and replied with slight attitude,  I can overlook that slip since she must hear it a million times a day, and the fact she herself has to work in it.  But a simple \"the owner is in the process of fixing it, and this is not normally the case\"; goes a long way.  In her defense, she warmed up once the subject was dropped.  We'll be back and try again in a few weeks perhaps.  Our order consisted of a small double pepperoni pizza,  a medium Barro's special, 24-wings, and a few beers.  Both pizza's had a wonderful crust and plenty of toppings.  I don't know how a feel about the Pizza Hut like diced onions and I'd frankly rather they'd been slices, but I guess different can be good sometimes, and that's minor.  I look forward to trying some of the other pizza combinations once a more appetizing scent exists.  They would be probably earn 4 solid stars at that point in my opinion."}
{"text":"Over the past three years or so we have gone to Barros 2 to 3 times per month. Over that last few months the quality of food and service has dropped a lot. Tonight we were there and ordered a pizza with double sausage. The average slice had 2-3 pieces of sausage and some only had one piece. When we asked the clerk what the standards were for our order she responded ,\"I don't have a clue\". She then asked what she should do and we responded that she should make it known that we were not happy. That was the last we saw or heard from her or anyone there. There are too many places to eat pizza. No one should have to put up with poor service and not getting what you pay for. I recommend that you go to a parlor that cares about your business."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza, eat in or take out. My first time last night. The wait was a bit longer than usual for take out but it was a Friday night. We had two medium pizzas..half pepperoni, half meatball and a meat lovers. The meatball was the favorite. The other two a bit salty for me but still very good. The place is fairly large and nicely decorated.   The college aged women they have working, about 10 of them have obviously been trained and do a great job. They are organized and it runs like clockwork. They are also friendly and seem confident."}
{"text":"I'm cranky. (I'm on weight watchers and saved all my points for pizza) Long story short my order got screwed up. I was ready to cancel my order and give up. The manager fixed it in a professional way and I respect the customer service. Now excuse me while I eat my favorite comfort food from my favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"we were quite disappointed when a sign was put on the door that they do not allow firearms.  Because our constitutional rights aren't supported we will not support this establishment any longer."}
{"text":"Horrible service...got home with the wrong order & I have to go pick it up unless I want to wait 45 minutes for them to deliver the correct order. Annoyed!"}
{"text":"Pizza was like I remember it, Wings? ehhh not as good as I remember from years ago."}
{"text":"Great service, great quality FRESH dough and ingredients.  My family always loves coming here to this great neighborhood pizzeria.  Everyone always seems to have a smile at this place.  All that, wrapped into what I consider to be the best quality for the price of any pizza joint around, keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Can't beat Barro's lunch specials!  Saturday Kona pizza is my favorite cheat meal!  (add a little salad and at least I feel a little healthy!)"}
{"text":"Love.  This.  Pizza.  I'm a fat kid, trust me.  Haven't had the wings though so your on your own there"}
{"text":"We arrived to our hotel a bit late, starving and luckily Barro's delivered to our hotel. That being said I am not sure it is a good thing. Maybe the pizza is better in the restaurant but I was SO disappointed in the cheese sticks as well as the pizza especially after reading other reviews.  The pizza and cheese sticks were greasy (and not in a good way). The sauce and pizza lacked flavor. On a positive note the crust was good and not soggy.   Next time I will ask what other options for pizza delivery the hotel recommends."}
{"text":"In a huge world of pizza options, you can pretty much go anywhere and we do.  But sometimes you just want what you want and I love to go to Barro's.  They do a decent job on their pizza and wings - but my favorite is the Sicilian salad.  Primo.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Our favorite local pizza and boneless wings.  Always do pickup and it's ready when we get there. We get the white pizza or BBQ chicken regularly. They are always friendly.  Wish we weren't put in hold EVERY time we call, but it's just a couple minutes.  With all the pizza choices we have in town we always go to Barro's."}
{"text":"I finally broke down and ordered the white pizza. All I can say is EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Original crust is substantial and always cooked to perfection, fresh large toppings, and good service. Also like the wings."}
{"text":"We ordered a 10 inch pizza and barbecue wings. The wings were good, they had a lot of flavor and a lot of meat. I have had better, but they were still good and for the price you can't beat it. No to the pizza, the pizza was so good we loved it. We have sausage and bacon 10 inch piece of me and my daughter shared and we ate two slices and couldn't finish The rest of it. It came with six slices."}
{"text":"Bad customer service there's a lady with black hair that's really rude! I went for lunch and she was very unwelcoming and acting annoyed that I was ordering. I asked her if there was a problem and another customer came up to me and told me she has a nasty attitude and gave her problems as well! So I ended up walking out! Will not come back! Crazy thing is my job orders here all the time will definitely pass this along"}
{"text":"We come here a lot. Really like the pizza and the staff is friendly. That's the good. The bad: dirty, dirty, dirty. High chairs are sticky and filthy. It's seems that they wipe down the tables only at closing time. The children play area is dirty. Every thing that can be filthy is filthy. When we walked in there were dirty tables outside with trash all over them. We left an hour later they hadn't  been touched, except by the flies. All the chairs are greasy and sticky. I don't understand how you can run a business that serves food and be so disgusting and unsanitary. They probably don't wash there hands after using the restroom. Won't go back.  I'm going to call the health department tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love this location. The service is always good and the pizza is always delicious. We usually get the pizza and cheese bread sticks. Sometimes the wings. It's always good."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered from Barros religiously since we moved to Arizona. When we moved to the Foothills we were thrilled to see a Barros just down the road.  The delivery times are way better than pretty much any other chain and we've pretty much never had an issue with the food.  Well that stops today.  I decided to try something different since I was home alone and I've always been curious about the \"White with Ricotta & Tomato Pizza\".  I call and get some smart-alec teenager on the phone who proceeds to tell me there is no such thing on their menu, he doesn't know what Ricotta cheese is and I must not be on the right website.  That's right, of course it's me because I only had to go through like 3 people saying Barros before I could try to place my order. I gave up and placed an order through someone else and called back for a manager. Some dipstick picks up the phone and again proceeds to tell me there is no such thing, they've never had anything like this on the menu.  So I say \"humor me pull up your website menu.\"  Ta-da there it is, then I find out I'm not even talking to a manager because he conveniently isn't there and it sounds pretty close to the moron who told me he didn't know what ricotta cheese was.  Bottom line, like I just told these kids, bad customer service will screw you every time. Good thing I'm not that big on pizza but the good news is I can get it elsewhere and it is better."}
{"text":"Fair and fast service. The pizza was great. Will definitely order again. Unlike dominoes, the delivery drivers at Barros can actually find your house! They'll even call you, if they can not. A concept so crazy that it works!"}
{"text":"I'm big on pizza an their sauce, this one top rated pizza as first time at Barro's. Went with original crust, that was great if you like thick crust.overall, I definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't rate zero or negative stars. What a horribly run store. Ordered 5 pizzas and wings at 11:20 and were quoted 25-30 minutes. Showed up 45 minutes after call and waited 5-10 before asking for an update. \"Manager guy\" comes out and tells up the order was just going in the over. Asked for a refund and went back to the office empty handed. Thank you Barro's for ruining lunch time on behalf of 14 people that work less than a mile away and will take this place off their lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Our favorite Pizza place.... Great price too! Tastes real. The only problem is sometimes they get our order wrong for delivery. But they did deliver a free pizza when it was totally wrong. We order them once a week!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Barro's after seeing it rated the best pizza on ABC15's poll. Literally the worst pizza I've ever had. Sauce was bad. Crust was bad. Cheese was bad (not even sure how that happens). Plus it was really inconsistent. One half of the pizza would have tons of sauce and the other half would be practically dry. If you're thinking about trying Barro's - DON'T! There are plenty of better pizza places around the valley that are better. Hell, I've had frozen pizza better than this."}
{"text":"I love Barro's Pizza although I had never been to this location before. A previous reviewer commented on the bad smell and, unfortunately, the intensity of that smell was understated. It was so bad that I found myself gagging after we walked in and we had to leave. There is clearly a mold or sewer problem that needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Tasty boneless wings, and cheesy pizza. Love the thick fluffy crust. Must order the pazzookie! Great for large family, get together. Kids friendly, kiddie tables, play food, video games,  and play food..."}
{"text":"For Phoenix it's really good pizza. It is far better than the national chains.   Tonight I had an especially good experience. I placed an order online for pick up. I ordered one of their specials, two large one topping pizzas for $17.99. I requested extra sauce on each pizza. When the girl taking my order gave me the total she had charged me for the extra sauce. I wasn't upset because I had ordered it, even though I thought it was odd as I had never had to pay for extra sauce at ANY pizza place I have ever been to.  When I went to pick up my order the girl ringing up the order (TLC is the name of cashier listed on the receipt) was nice enough (without me asking) to take off the extra charge for the extra sauce. It's a small thing but it speaks loud about good customer service.   To be honest I would have ordered from Barro's Pizza again in the future if \"TLC\" had not removed the extra charge, but now I'm more than happy to recommend them to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Love love love Barros pizza!!!! Every time my wife and I order pizza they are friendly and courteous and our order always arrive ahead of time and the delivery drivers are also just as courteous and friendly. Barros is our absolute FAVORITE!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!!!! YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Barros Maricopa food quality could be better floors and tables are filthy I half of the is old radio shack building very hot the other side is both side building needs major cleaning."}
{"text":"My Favorite, take out pizza place.  That is all i have to say......Oh yeah, get the thin crust!!"}
{"text":"Barro's has the best thick-crusted pizza known to the state of Arizona in my opinion. I have been to so many of their locations at so many different times, and I have never had anything to complain about. I love this business and their food. It disturbs me a little to find places like Geno's getting equal to higher scores. There is a huge difference from cheap pizza made on the fly to a place like Barro's. Just saying, America.   Great place to watch sports and bring kids. If you want good pizza, try Barro's. It's the best."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Anthem! We eat here every Friday night.  Love the XL pizza."}
{"text":"Today I had the most amazing pizza ever! I am allergic to the red sauce and so I asked for a white pizza thin crust instead. It was so delicious and fresh. Definitely recommend this location and definitely will come back. Superior customs service too!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas 1 regular crust cheese, one thin crust pepperoni. Loved it!! Ordered online. The pizza where hot when we got them. Great service/delivery. I think we found our pizza place. Way better than dominos or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"A little inconsistent with forgetting items but seems to be getting better!"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Barros before and the pizza was 3.5 stars.... They dropped to 2 stars cause there was literally NO sauce on my pizza.... Please don't skimp on the sauce!"}
{"text":"Normally Barro's is quite delicious, tonight, not so much. Wings were dry and soggy, ordered a large sub and got a small. One of the other sandwiches we got was just a joke entirely. We called and spoke to a manager, and we're informed that a 12\" meatball sub gets a WHOPPING 2 meatballs, cut up and split between the two halves.   This used to be one of our favorite places to order from but, sadly, we won't be anymore."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza was so salty it was inedible. I have to think something has changed or the accidentally dropped the salt shaker on this one. Please check the sodium content on your ingredients Barro's.   I hope your reading your reviews and taking this stuff to heart. We have loved supporting this business for the last 10 years+."}
{"text":"Barro's has been our Go-To take-out for years. Last night we got a large cheese and noticed the crust has changed and not for the better. I hope it was a fluke, maybe someone forgot a key ingredient."}
{"text":"Customer service is fantastic! I called in an order for pickup(24 wings & XL pizza), I ordered them extra crispy/well done. Got home & the bleu cheese & ranch had spilled in the bag & the wings were soggy. I called to let them know & Ashlyn the manager was so nice! She let us keep the wings & replaced them with new ones that were crispy & included lots of extra sauces at no charge! Super impressed & greatly satisfied with the service I received. Will definitely continue ordering from this location :)"}
{"text":"I have loved Barros since I have moved to Arizona.  We have ordered weekly.  But I have to slam the Barros in Glendale at 59th Ave and Thunderbird.  I am unsure why the last 5-10 times I have ordered the same items...why it is so difficult for them to get it right. I order delivery and they get it wrong every time.  I am surprised that the manager doesn't know me by name at this point... Guess it is time to find a new pizza delivery place.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best Pizza N. Phx hands down. Yes, some places make a good pie like Grimaldis but going there is such a pain. Barros is always good, service is fast, Salad bar is good and it's nice to support a local company/family in the N Phx / Cave Creek community."}
{"text":"A friend told me yo check them out and I'm glad he did!!!! This place is Super yummy and the antipasto was fabulous!!!!! I'll definite go back!!!"}
{"text":"Normally a 5 star spot on account of the pizza alone, the affordable and filling lunch special is awesome, and the people who work there are usually very friendly. My recent visit left a bit to be desired, though. The cashier took a while to get to us, and there was no line to speak of, only one person in front of us. My friend got his order in, and then when it was my turn they ran out of sausage pizza, so I had to have it run out to my table. Not the end of the world, this has happened before and they usually have my second slice to me before I've finished the first. This time, it took quite a bit longer. It seemed like they were unprepared for the large groups of kids' soccer teams, but that's probably the same crowd they get every Saturday. All that aside, it's still a delicious slice of pizza, so I'd strongly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Tasty Chicago-style pizza, great and affordable lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars.  My issue  is lack of consistency. Sometimes my pizza is delicious other times it's so bad it's inedible. The only other? thing I have  ordered is a side salad,  and 80% was wilted and turning...also it was a  salad without tomatoes.   it sucks because the times that it was good it was really good,  but there's been just too many times it was inedible.   I don't know if it's just this location ,  I just recently moved here."}
{"text":"Staff was too busy gossiping with one another and talking badley about other employees to bring me my pizza when it was done."}
{"text":"Love the food. However, if it's Friday or Saturday night you need to be willing to wait because it's made fresh and takes time. The only reason why I'm giving a four versus five star is because twice on my take out they messed up on my salad. But other than that, love it."}
{"text":"I love this pizza, thick crust especially.  Not the wings, I went to wing stop it is right across the street and they had more options.  But for pizza, Barros is it!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this Barros probably once a week and we have noticed that it has gotten a bit busier which is a good thing!The place is always clean and the food is phenomenal. I would like to give praise to the all the staff and management on 2/23/2017 for keeping up with the crowd and still managing in providing great customer service.I spoke with the manager (Joey) and let him know that his staff is always amazing. Thank You for being part of the Chandler community!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and wings! So delicious and a great value as well. We order a lot of pizza, and this is our current favorite in Tempe."}
{"text":"Barrows is my favorite place for pizza in anthem. I call 20 minutes ahead and the pizza is ready.  Good consistent quality. One can also dine in. They usually have some kind of special pricing running. Ask for the specials when you call in."}
{"text":"Only get carry out from this location. Food always is awesome ,but several times I have wanted certain salads and they are out of the ingredients to make it. Other then that small set back...I believe that they even have a gluten free crust."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here.  I used to come to Barro's all the time when I worked from home for lunch.  They have a great lunch special!  You can get a drink and a slice for $2.50!  Who can complain about that??  The pizza is really good, too.   I took my family there for dinner the other night and the whole family had pizza and a drink for about $20,  and we had leftovers!"}
{"text":"Had the mega meat pizza... It was pretty good. Usually take my kids here as it has a play area."}
{"text":"All around good pizza, reasonably priced, and flexible if you have two people that want different types of pizzas or toppings. We will be back, but I wish they had basil and spinach.   On the other hand, my boyfriend and his colleagues crave this place all the time! So if you're not picking and love pizza.... it's right up your alley!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Girls up front are always nice and polite. For lunch, we like to order the small meatball sandwich. It's only $3.49 and it comes with chips. Can't get a deal like that elsewhere! I like the two separate dining areas. The smaller side is much more quiet. Great family spot for grub."}
{"text":"Not sure if I should even write a review, since I've never actually been IN this one! BUT, very good Gluten Free pizza! Had it delivered one night after a hellish work shift, and even though it was pricy, definitely hit the spot. Will have to update this when I dine in the specific location sometime."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza and AMAZING mozzarella sticks. My mouth is watering just thinking about them... I can't wait to go back to Arizona. Definitely make a stop here if you're a pizza lover.  The entire restaurant is doused in sports memorabilia and every TV is on a different sporting event. I think there is even some arcade games in the back!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and I have not yet been that impressed! Friends continue to tell me how great this place is? I don't get it!!! Pizza is pretty much plain. Nothing special about sauce, dough, or anything! Maybe we should dine in and see how it is right out of the oven? I'll let you know how that goes? In the mean time, place is just OK!"}
{"text":"Consistently get good customer service whether ordering for dine-in or carry out. Tasty American style pizza.  Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place when we can't decide what's for dinner. It never disappoints! Pizza's great, sports on multiple tv's and a play area for the kids. Service is always good and the price is right!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their vegetarian pizza.  Is it the absolutely, positively, BEST veggie pizza I've ever had? No...not even close. BUT I will say its the best veggie pizza I've found on an order out menu in YEARS.   The only thing that perplexes me is that there are NO tomatoes on it! I still don't understand why tomatoes, fresh OR cooked aren't part of a veggie pizza. Perhaps it is because a tomato is actually a FRUIT?!   My hubby says the other pizzas (think meat lovers, peperoni) are equally as delicious as my vegetarian. I'll just have to take his word on that."}
{"text":"Love barros. However this location needs improvements. 50-70% of the time the pizza is messed up.. too much cheese (i didnt know this was even possible but it is) toppings that i didnt order etc..   Pinapple can ruin a pizza :( I ordered a specialty pizza from their menu with NO changes and they added a bunch of pineapple?!? Gross   Emailed complaining and they never emailed back when i receieved a pizza badly damaged on delivery. This was the final straw. All the toppings were on one side of the pizza and it was not edible.   I love barros but ive given up on this location."}
{"text":"Service is great!! The twin sisters that work here are very professional and friendly always. Actually all the kids are fantastic. As usual the lunch specials are a pretty good deal. I generally always get a few slices but again its all about the great service by the two sisters! We need more great customer service like this :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza, great lunch specials everyday. It's close to everything and always have had a smile at the counter. They have a small play area for kids with a tv with kids stuff on it while the rest have sports"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, rivaled only by Venezia's pizza. This is however Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"This place is just average. The crust is not crispy but also not crisp. Pretty slow service too."}
{"text":"Made an order and one of the pizzas was delivered incorrect. Made a call and they delivered a new one with very few questions. Unfortunately it was the GFCF for my daughter and Brother. Thank you Borrows for making it again and delivering it. 4 stars for customer service!"}
{"text":"So funny thing, I used to hate pizza. People said it was an anomaly...its not possible for someone to not like pizza. Every time I ate pizza I found myself thinking of Anchorman... \"Milk was a bad choice\".. and yes pizza always felt like a bad choice. Then when I realized I was sensitive to gluten it all made sense.  Barro's is one of the first gluten free pizza I've had and I'm finally starting to see what everyone's raving about with pizza in general. Their gluten free pizza is really good and I haven't been gluten free for long so I still remember what regular pizza tastes like and this isn't far off, plus I don't feel terrible afterward. The Gluten free pizza isn't very big (10\") and it costs extra but that is just the gluten free world.   My boyfriend usually gets a regular pizza, sometimes he gets wings too and loves it. Nothing every goes to waste, we eat it all!  They also deliver in a certain mile radius which makes it convenient for us to have delicious gluten free cheesy pizza noms delivered to our door.   We've never been in the actual establishment to eat but we've heard from friends its a great place to go have a beer, some pizza and wings and chill.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good gluten free pizza or just good pizza in general"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. We called in an order for delivery and they told us they didn't deliver to our area yet we live a mile away. When we came in the manager said \"we deliver, the girls just don't know the area\" I'll be sticking to other pizza options from now on."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff ready to greet customers & place their orders. I stick to the classic pepperoni pizza and it's always made to taste buds' heaven. I've gone in during a lunch hour work & high school early release rush and I still was able to enjoy a decent amount of time for lunch i.e. they were quick to serve. So far, no complaints on my end."}
{"text":"Usually we love this place, but have discovered that when they are busy just don't go there. We got a large thin crust and some cheese bread to go. Took over an hour for it to be ready and when we got it home it was a disgusting greasy mess. I could barely finish one piece. Called to complain and were left on hold, no one ever bothered to get back to us. Needless to say, we will never be returning."}
{"text":"After trying Barro's for the first time 3 years ago I cant seem to go back to any of those plain places like domino's, pizza hut and etc. Absolutely love this place! The food, employees etc,"}
{"text":"Yum! Never disappoints! If you live in Anthem and want good pizza, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I LOVE Barro's.  They have my favorite delivery pizza around.  Their thin crust is my favorite. Just the right amount of crunchiness to it. And good balance of sauce with cheese.  They opened a location on Thompson Peak closer to me as well so I use them there now too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small pepperoni pizza to-go and was told it would be about 10 minutes. It was almost twice that long and the edges of the crust were burnt. The toppings and sauce were average and the crust had a nice chew. The flavor was good. A small single item pizza was $6.50. The dining area is well-worn, but spacious. Parking is close to the door. The employee taking my order was pleasant. Overall, a 3.5 star experience."}
{"text":"Glad this place opens in my hood. Since it's new, they should have brought more trained people to work here. The floors were dirty and somethings needed to be wiped down. Staff was friendly and fun and as always we adore Barros pizza."}
{"text":"If you want a 5 dollar gross pizza! You won't find it here!!! Great pizza at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza and a Sunday afternoon watching football is like mashed potatoes and gravy, they just go together.   If you're like me, Sunday is a day to break from my daily regimen of violating each of the seven deadly sins, but it's hard Ringo, it's real hard.   Sloth, couch. Lust, cheerleaders. Anger, losing team is my team. Greed, medium sized bet hoping to parlay truck payment into house payment. Envy, I wish I was an NFL player. Pride, gloating over win.  And then there's gluttony...  Gluttony happens when I'm out of beer,  need food, and, (refer to sloth) refuse to cook. Tortilla chips and bean dip won't cut it. I need something substantial. Enter Barro's.  Barro's makes a fine pie, both thin and thick crust. They deliver within an hour, and, I don't even have to move from the couch.  Their wings are good too. With a medium pie, dozen wings and tip, I'm all in at 25 bucks.  I love Barro's, even though they are a sinful enabler."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I know employees want to have fun at work but the noise racket by their conversation and personal relationship issues were so annoying that I packed up what was left of my food and took it home"}
{"text":"This used to be a good pizza place, but over the past year, this location at 83rd and Cactus has gone downhill. Not going back as was not happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Barro's is a great pizza place and I really recommend it for people who are into thick crust, great sauce and very good cheese! Their BBQ chicken pizza is also amazing, try it!"}
{"text":"They always do a great job for us. Great pizza and an attentive staff. Their options are great too. This app says my review is too short, so I'm making it a little bit longer. It's just pizza, but sooooooooooo good."}
{"text":"This location needs help. The pizza is good but you will wait a long time for your food. The interior of the restaurant is very dark, drab, and depressing. As I look around, I see trash under tables, burnt out Budweiser signs, and a nasty looking ceiling. In the middle of lunch service a man came through with a cart and was replacing the rugs through out the restaurant. I've never seen that before in any restaurant."}
{"text":"food is good but horrible service and wait time . we are the only customers here and it's been over 30 min and still waiting for food. wow."}
{"text":"we ordered a whole combo pie. They do not skimp on the toppings, but you pay for it.  So it was a filing slice or two.  The crust was thin and crispy."}
{"text":"Pizza good and quick but service to be desired. Maybe don't know the concept they don't care about their customers only up to the point of delivering the food. Then it's you. May I get to go boxes?"}
{"text":"I ordered two kids meals online and was told 25 minutes for pick up. I show up 25 minutes later and I am told my order is not ready and it would be another 10 minutes because it is in the oven. No problem, I can understand an extra 10 minutes. After 20 minutes I ask about my order again and get told it will be another two minutes in the oven. So if it's been 20 minutes already that my order is supposedly in the oven, I'm pretty sure it is burnt by this point if that is the truth of the status of my order. This was for a kids spaghetti and meatballs and a kids pepperoni garlic bread. They did offer to give me a free 2 L of soda, that was ridiculous. I waited for five more minutes and then requested my money back and as soon as I did, magically my order was ready. I took the refund and the food, but I will never return. Not once did the manager talk to me. This was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"What a great place to take a bunch of hard working production staff who love pizza for lunch. Their usual lunch special which includes a large pizza, pepperoni of course, and a dozen wings for $22, I think those are the details!?!?  We order 2 specials and it is enough food to feed 5 to 7 hungry workers.  The pizza is very good! It is the perfect everyday, really cheesy, nice and greasy pizza you would expect for a good pizza joint. Their wings are cook just how they should and are nice and spicy.  The fact that it is close to my work and the guys like it makes it a great lunch spot a few times a month.   Well done Barros!"}
{"text":"For my reference an x-lg pizza is 12 slices. The $26 deal of a 1 topping xl pizza and 24 wings is all for the wings. 24 wings alone is $16.99. The xl pizza is $11.99. Ill stick to the 2 lg pizza deal next time."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location .  We always go to the baseline and gilbert location. The customer service here sucks!! The teenager girl that took our order was rude. Even though we live far out east I think I will keep going to Baseline and Gilbert location.. The food was great."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! This was my 2nd time having it (1st at this location), and it was just as good as the first.  We live down the road so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous gooey, cheesy, melted goodness. Barro's pizza is the best I've had in town. The marinara sauce is so flavorful. I usually order a cheese pizza, boneless wings (hot sauce is perfect) and mozzarella sticks. They never disappoint! Even their ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces are unexpectedly good.   I've ordered half a dozen times from this location and even on a busy Saturday I never wait more than 30mins for delivery even though I'm quoted a little longer. Everything always arrives hot and fresh. This place is my pizza craving fix."}
{"text":"Barros used to be our go to pizza place. But due to long delivery times and decrease in customer service we began ordering from a different place.  So tonight we decided to give Barros a second chance. We were pleasantly surprised. We were told it would take nearly an hour to receive our order but it arrived just slightly over 40 minutes. The pizza was delicious! It appears the issues we experienced before have been corrected."}
{"text":"Great pizza that has not changed since I worked at throne in Rolling Meadows 39 years ago. Great Pizza, great Football Coach, great family. Hello to Mike, Ken and Coach."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Just moved here made sure this location delivers to our area. They do. After that it's all down hill. I had to spell out my address twice. I had to repeat my order 3 times. I was hung up on 3 times. I called from my sister phone same thing. We called from our other phone same thing and they were rude to us. Here's the thing zellas Pizza could hear me just fine! Guess you didn't want our business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chicago style pizza in the area. If you get one of their two pizza deals, it doesn't kill the wallet and it is decent food."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, I ordered a large pepperoni pizza with wings and cheese bread.  Everything had good flavor and was a nice change from some of the chain pizza places.  The pizza crust and cheese bread were  thicker than I like, but other than that the flavor was good.  I will be ordering from here again, my family enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"the lunch menu for weekday is great. they get you in quickly and for about 5 bucks a slice, drink and a sallad.."}
{"text":"This location is a few doors down in the complex where my work is so it's easy to get in and out of. The ONLY drawback is lunchtime is very busy and crowded there, being that Dobson High School is just down the street and many of the students frequent this place for lunch.   The customer service is good and the food is delicious. Just waiting for your food, especially pasta, when you order it to go, sucks. That seems to be the only knock I have against this restaurant. The restaurant is always clean and presentable. It's open and roomy and has lots of tables and booths to sit at when dining in. There are also a few video games to play while waiting for orders to be brought to the table or to pick up and go.   My co-workers go there a lot since it's just a few doors down from work and since they have GREAT pizza, pasta, wings, and salads, why go anywhere else, right? Can't go wrong with their food."}
{"text":"Love me some Barro's! Great service, delicious food, & a nice, clean, accessible restaurant are what this place offers & delivers!"}
{"text":"Consistently Delicious  There are those times when you just want a quick and easy pizza because there isn't time for dinner. Then there are those  nights when you want a good pizza and a nice place to sit down relax, enjoy, and eat. Barro's is that option.  Barro's is home town, home made pizza, wings, salad and more place.  I have been going to Barros for years and have never been disappointed.  Barros is wallet friendly compared with other  high price pizza joints in the community.  The staff at Barros is very friendly, pizza is great every time and the restaurant always provides  a clean and welcoming dining experience."}

{"text":"Best Pizza place in town!  Very pretty dark-haired cashier (sounds like she is from the Empire State or maybe even Jersey)."}
{"text":"I waited for some time to write this review I needed to have all of my facts in order.   A while ago I ordered a pizza for delivery - I used my debit card and they took my order and information over the phone. With in 24 hours of that order - my account information was used for a $1400 online purchase. We resolved the issue with our bank immediately and got the police involved. We did suspect that the the person who took our order as Barros used it to make the purchase. After some time and a lack of information the investigation ended with no arrests. However, we did more digging. We learned that the management of this particular restaurant stoned walled the investigation - they did everything to protect the employee and their reputation. If they had nothing to hide then why block the police?    Fact - a Barros employee stole my banking information at the time of purchase Fact - they used the information Fact - the police and myself both agreed that the suspect was a Barros employee Fact - Barros management stonewalled the investigation Fact - Barros avoided/covered up the crime.   Do yourself a favor - do not do business with Barros   Sadly, because the evidence is all circumstantial I cannot take personal legal action action Barros - believe me if I could I would."}
{"text":"Quality pies, quality ingredients, and good service! So much better then those box store pies. Priced well and quick service. Next time you need a pie try Barros!"}
{"text":"Great food & wonderful people!  I just love the breadsticks with cheese.  It is the best!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place... normally it's awesome! Not sure what happened with our pizza tonight... so greasy it leaked through the box and when we got it home all the cheese and toppings had basically slid off. Like I said, normally it's great. Something was off tonight for sure."}
{"text":"Approx two weeks ago I was in this Barros for the first time. I ordered a dozen wings as well as a salad, I was not happy with either one. I posted on Yelp my dissatisfaction. Having owned my own businesses I know that it's like to have an employee make a customer mad and that customer quit doing business with me. When I would talk with them my standard statement was I can't fix what's broken if I don't know. I didn't do that to the mgr of Barros, instead I post on Yelp. Tonight I received a call from Amy Barro, she and her husband own this one. She said she saw my post and wanted to apologize for my experience and that this was not the way she wanted her customers taken care of. She offered me a credit which I accepted. I didn't not expect a call, I didn't expect anything, for the owner of the company to call was extremely impressive and showed me that Barro's really cares about their customers. For no other reason than this phone call I'll go back to Barro's and try them again. More owners need to do what Mrs Barro did, contact the customer and do your best to make it right. I applaud Barro's Pizza. Thank you."}
{"text":"Their pizza is awesome, their hot wings are so deadly but so good (prepare to use the bathroom), they charge 55c per ranch???? Tf. But their food overall is good.   Service is ok"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE barros pizza and I used to ALWAYS order from there. I now live in a \"non-delivery\" area which sucks because I end up order from their competitors when I don't feel like driving to pick it up.   This location was solid. Order Large pepperoni and sausage with wings for the family. Wings were great, pizza was excellent - solid place for a great pie."}
{"text":"Let me cut to the chase.  This place sucks!  When they closed the Power and Queen Creek location figured this location would be the same.  It's just down the street.  Not at all.  We ordered a number of times and it's just well below average.  Last night ordered two pizzas and one had no cheese.  We get the delivery and no cheese and also no freakin sauce.  Basically, cardboard with toppings.  Called and they connected me to manager and he said he'd get another one out. Get that and at the door looked in the box to find the exact same thing.  No sauce.  Seriously, who's in the kitchen the three stooges.  Told the guy to take it back and tell the manager.  Never heard anything, no call and so no reason to ever spend another dollar at Barros at any location."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I was in the area and the service/food was disappointing . I ordered a small half kona without chicken and half vegan gluten free pizza for pick up , then at pick up they told me they didn't make it BC the kona ingredients have gluten ect and didn't bother to call me to tell me this . On their menu it says U can make any pizza gluten free dough for $3 more so why is it a issue now ? They said it would only 6 minutes but made me wait 20 minutes ! Additionally , I paid for the half and half priced at 13$ , THEN told me they didn't make it . Once I got my pizza I asked the cashier how much just a small kona pizza was which was 10$.. And reminded her I was charged for the $13 pie  and asked for the difference . Lost my appetite . Then the pizza was soggy and only had pineapple on it no teriyaki sauce !! Thumbs down . And I love pizza that's pretty pathetic ."}
{"text":"Usually love Barro's but super disappointed in this one. Just a big salty greasy mess. A good portion of the pizza has nothing and the rest has too much. I'd like my $20 back please.  Update: I was contacted by Barro's and offered my money back but I chose to take a credit which we used tonight. I was happy with the customer service. And this pizza did look better than the last one. Still not up to normal Barro's standards which I would normally give 5 stars. We also ordered wings for my husband and he said they were bland. Bland hot wings. He normally loves their wings. Is it just this location? Never had issue before."}
{"text":"I used to travel often to this area for work and ate at Barro's pizza locations regularly so when we went on vacation to Phoenix over Christmas, I was excited to visit Barro's again.  Unfortunately I was disappointed in this location. We arrived about 15 or 20 minutes after they opened for the day and at least 3/4 of the tables were dirty. I couldn't understand why so many tables were dirty when they just opened unless the crew from the night before didn't clean before closing the restaurant.  The food was good and tasted just as I remembered, but I was completely unimpressed with the dirtiness of the location. Some of the tables were sticky also, even after being wiped down, as if the finish was damaged. There were still ring marks from glasses after the table was cleaned right in front of us so I'd say these tables need a good clean and maybe a refinishing.  I do think maybe Barro's management should find out why a dirty restaurant was what some of the first customers of the day saw."}
{"text":"We were moving in Cave Creek and called a number of pizza delivery places. For some reason few deliver to our new home. I call Barros and they say they dont deliver to our area yet. I 2as exhausted. I didn't even ask but gal asked me to hold and came back and said they would deliver to us! God send when I was moving! Love the pizza but also the customer service! I would give them 10 stars. Over and beyond!"}
{"text":"The pizza is truly great. But delivery times are now routinely over an hour which is way too long. I hope they can hire the appropriate amount of drivers because I've started ordering from other places that deliver much much faster."}
{"text":"We like Barro's pizza normally.  This was my first time to this location.   I ordered online...  Extra large pizza with pepperoni and green pepper and half of it with extra mushrooms. I also ordered some extra crispy wings.   I picked the food up and luckily I checked before getting home...had to go back.  The pizza was more like... pepperoni with about 5 or 6 pieces with green peppers (the pieces aren't touching each other though so more like they tried to put them on the whole thing but missed most of the pieces? There were extra mushrooms on about 4 pieces too... And light mushrooms on EVERY SINGLE OTHER PIECE. The girl told me maybe it was bell peppers. Even if it was... They were teeny tiny burnt pieces that looked like mushroom flakes. Why do some of your bell peppers look green and normal while most of them look like mushrooms or burnt flakes then? Either way it's a issue.  My boyfriend HATES mushrooms. I literally couldn't find a single piece of pizza without what looked like mushrooms on it. Ugh... I couldn't bring this home. And for my $40 I shouldn't have to!  Also...my extra crispy wings are absolutely not crispy. They're super soggy and got even more soggy while they sat in the car while waited for my new pizza.  I can't imagine what the non-extra crispy wings must be like.  I really can't imagine these being any more soggy.   I ordered 6 boneless wings for my doggies to share. There were 4 decent boneless wings, then some other pieces... They appeared to be like remnants of a chicken strip maybe? Hardly any meat and broken into little pieces. Maybe they ran out of boneless wings? I dunno. The dogs ate it just the same.   The girl who dealt with my issue asked if I want to keep the first pizza. I told her I'd eat it but my bf wouldn't. I told her I don't want her to think I'm trying to scam her out of a pizza. She opted to keep it.  OK. That kind of makes me think she believes I'm trying to scam her. But whatever...  So I sat down, waiting for my new pizza. Wings in the car.  No offer of a water or anything while I wait. It's 101 degrees outside today.   Just watching other customers... One guy who asked for 3 ranch cups and was told they would be 50 cents each. He insisted that he wouldn't have to pay for them bc he knows... Erica I believe he said? I don't know who Erica is, but if you want free ranch cups at Barro's, just say you know her, bc it worked for him and he wasn't charged the $1.50  Haha.   So after the extra 20 minutes for a new pizza, I took everything home and guess what? My boyfriend commented about how he usually likes Barro's but this isn't good at all.    Between three people and 2 dogs... We only ate half a pizza and 4 wings. I pretty sure I ate all 4 wings. I didn't enjoy them at all. I just forced them down bc I felt bad throwing them out.   Needless to say we won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Have ordered from this location too many times to count and honestly have never had an issue until today. Driver claims can't find my address in his GPS - confirmed the address driver rudely interrupted me and said \"can't find it.\"   My response was cancel the order and in the middle of asking him about my refund he hung up on me.  Complained to manager of the store and got no resolution or explanation regarding the ineptitude of his driver. Not even an offer to make it right.  Don't bother responding Barros -  you've officially lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst serviced establishments I have visited in my life. Upon arrival we were greeted and had our order taken. The register attendant didn't even seem to know the menu, even though the display is right behind him as well, but possibly was new so that I overlook.  Our order was taken and we waited 40 minutes just for 12 chicken wings (that came out cold). Note, we are the ONLY people sitting in the establishment. As another 25 minutes pass we still do not have our ONE SINGLE pizza pie that we ordered. Both were ordered at the same time. Employees began to walk by and clean and none cared to ask if we were waiting for something or anything (instead one tried to small talk after we told him we were waiting for our pizza and instead decided to tell us \"Well I hope it comes out\" as if the staff forgetting is an everyday thing).  Finally we had to finally approach the register, just to find out our pizza wasn't started and was forgotten about. We were then fed some excuse that the \"machine was out of printing paper, and they didn't think to refill it\". So our order was forgotten about due to pure laziness it seems. As we were sitting other online or call ahead orders came in and out in minutes or even seconds, so leads me to believe the paper must've been filled otherwise how are these customers orders coming in? Even if it's called in, it goes into an electronic system that sends and prints the order in the back.  Lastly we were given a full refund, no pizza and had to go up the road to another Barro's where they were shocked at this experience and took care of us to an extraordinarily kind amount.  Wish I could give zero stars, but yelp is too kind and only lets me do one."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Comes out piping hot and very fresh. Staff is very friendly and up beat. Atmosphere is nice and kept clean and well organized. Pizza was quick to come out and tastes very good. Has awesome kona pizza which is my favorite but their pepperoni was good too."}
{"text":"While I am waiting for Pizza Hut to deliver, I have time to write this review. On 07/10/2015 at about 1216 hours, I ordered  carry out Borrow's Pizza for the kids here in Mesa, Arizona. I was told that it would take 15 minutes. At about 1258 hours while the family waited in the car, the pizza was finally presented...burnt. I requested a manager who argued that only a portion of the pizza was burnt. Its not that it wasn't ready on time, or the fact that \"only half\" (I guess) the pizza was burnt or even that we have been ordering from this business for years. But the managers shoulder shrug \"I don't care attitude\" burned me enough to waste my time writing this. That's okay, Pizza Hut delivery just arrived."}
{"text":"There are several different places within the Scottsdale Pavilions we frequent. Whenever we leave, we always say, \"We should check out Barro's Pizza before we  go.\" Somehow, we never follow through.  Well, as fate would have it, my daughter and I ended up at the Pavilions on Black Friday, and we weren't going to pass on the opportunity this time.  As we approached the place, we were quite hopeful. The outdoor seating area was really nice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barros-pizza-scottsdale-2?select=8W27QfIPdP2p0wU6aN1N0Q#HrZNO76vToSoefR45IvLxg. There were four separate tables, completely shaded by a permanent awning. Even during the grueling summer months, this place would still make for a nice place to enjoy a beer and a slice.  Upon walking in, we were shocked at how empty the place was! I mean, it was lunch time on Black Friday...and my daughter doubled the clientele when we walked through the door. Not to mention the fact that the restaurant was quite nice.   The left side of the dining area appears to be the party section. There are several tables intermingled with banks of booth seating, all surrounded by multiple televisions. When we were there, each television was tuned in to a different sports channel, making it seem to be a fairly decent place to catch a game.  For a more intimate setting, there's a section of secluded booths. The backs of each booth are exceptionally high, making for a nice shelter from the inevitable cheering emanating from the aforementioned \"party section\" of the dining room. There were only a few of these seats available, so plan accordingly if you want to bring a date.  The far right portion of the dining area is devoted to families with kids. There are a few arcade games to entertain the older kids. There is one television, typically airing some sort of children's programming (Nickelodeon, in our case). There is also a \"make-believe\" section, where your children can play with Legos, or play make-believe while you drink away the sounds of other people's kids screaming http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barros-pizza-scottsdale-2?select=8W27QfIPdP2p0wU6aN1N0Q#kihDQjTywZ_YpLshpBCoJQ.  They have several different specials from which to choose that are very cost effective. In our case, we ordered a two slice combo for right around $5.00. The pizza itself was underwhelming. It was very obvious that the pizza had been sitting under the food warmer for quite some time. It was edible, but barely. That's not to say that all of their pizzas are bad. We noticed a pizza that was coming fresh out of the oven, and it looked amazing. I'm sure that if you order your own pizza instead of picking one off of the warmer, you'll fare better than we did.  I won't say that we're in a huge hurry to go back. But, I'll also say that I haven't completely written this place off. Given the different variables that led to our lackluster experience, I think that it would only be fair to give it another go one day. After all, if you mix in some of their fantastic beer prices, you probably won't taste the food anyway.  Quick side note about Barro's. The dining room closes 30 minutes early every night. So, if you're planning on coming in right before close, you'll end up leaving hungry, sober, and most likely angry. Consider this your warning about the dining room http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barros-pizza-scottsdale-2?select=8W27QfIPdP2p0wU6aN1N0Q#-PmxLOfucVkI_LwIbNT4bA."}
{"text":"Really liked this pizza!  Very reasonably priced!  We also ordered the mozzarella sticks.  Would definitely order here again."}
{"text":"I used to go to Barro's in Tempe all the time 15 years ago.  I moved away from the valley for over 10 years and have been back for 3. Just decided to try this location for the first time since I've been back,  and it was better than I even remembered.  Food was delicious, service was awesome.  It's definitely a family oriented place with lots of kids,  but it's really good quality pizza and wings.  It tastes great and you don't feel gross after eating it like you do at a lot of other pizza places that are super greasy and use low quality ingredients.  My husband and daughter loved it too.  I'm so glad we came back to Barro's and we will definitely be back to this location.  I can't say enough about how nice and pleasant the staff was."}
{"text":"The garlic parmasian wings are my favorite. I'm allergic to certain spicy foods, so being able to order wings that taste good with options other than hot sauce is awesome. Take out is always quick and correctly done. Will continue to order in from there."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza...I got the thin crust with bacon and CRUSHED a medium pizza by myself!! Now looking back I think they are known for their deep dish Chicago sytle pizza, so probably should have tried that...but theres always a NEXT TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Years back I loved Barros. Last couple years I have not even fond of it at all. I still will get it once in while after a long long work week and bc it's only thing close that I know of. Miss the old Barro's Pizza."}
{"text":"I guess I must have gone here on a bad day.  I saw so many good reviews of this place so I just had to give it a try.  We ordered a large Barro's Special (basically everything minus the green peppers) and the pizza was large and full of toppings.  The sausage, ham and pepperoni were all very tasty.  The sauce average and the cheese very minimal with little flavor.  The pizza itself was over-greasy.  Now I know good pizza should be a little greasy, but this was soggy-greasy.  So wet and oily you couldn't even pick up a slice.  It was just limp with wetness.  I did see the lunch specials and they seemed to be a good value, but I'm not sure how soon we'll be going back after this experience."}
{"text":"First visit was dinner.  I loved the chewy crust and there was just the right amount of char on the toppings.  Sauce was a little sweet for me, but still a great pizza.  Second visit was at lunch.  The gal working the counter was super efficient, and I appreciated there was no wait, but the slices weren't hot, just barely warm.  A slice with a drink was only $2.50 though so hard to complain about that!"}
{"text":"VERY unfortunate that I can't give zero stars. This is probably the worst service I have received. Waited 45+ minutes for my order of pizza, wings, and spaghetti to get here. When the driver gets here, he drops the spaghetti and the proceeds to tell me that I have to call the store and order a new one as he walks away. Um, excuse me? FINE. Called the store. Well, should have known that by the attitude of the driver I should have expected to receive the same attitude by the staff. Talked with the manager, and wish I caught her name, because she was rude. Seriously, you shouldn't be a manager. I have a 2 year old who wanted to have spaghetti, and you think I would wait another 45 minutes for a new one to come? Yeah, no. I asked for a refund because I can't wait even longer to feed my family. Instead of listening to what I had to say, this manager was trying to get me off the phone and say no problem we will send another out. I guess no doesn't mean no. It's pretty disrespectful that I have to continuously ask for some as YOUR customer, and hope that I don't get hung up on while making the request. The icing on this review is now I have to wait for a phone call back from this rude manager because clearly they don't have the time to process a refund now, and me as the customer has to wait until they have the time to do it. Wait, what? So unprofessional. Why do I have to wait for a call? I guess that's how 1 Star restaurants do it. I will never order from Barro's EVER again. You shall see this pasted on every social media site out there. Learn some customer service soft skills, learn how to listen, how to show empathy, and own up when you guys mess up. It's pretty basic. I'll probably end up disputing the charge as I have ZERO confidence that this so called manager will call me back to confirm she could take the time to process a refund. Hmmm, shady business practices?"}
{"text":"Great pizza, my first time here getting ready for my daughters wedding!  Ran pizza parlors when I was young, this is a traditional place. Food is what you expect and well done. Not sure if they have a thin crust. Cole establishment, someone ordered wings and they were good too."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for the group to grab a pizza and a pitcher! It certainly is not the best pie in town, but Barro's is, by far and away, the best dollar for value around.   You can get a lousy $5 pizza at all too many places. You can also pay upwards of $30 for a signature pizza. At Barro's,we get a very quality and appetizing pizza for $10-$12.   The establishment is super clean. The staff is amazingly friendly. Barro's also supports several youth programs in the area.   Job well done!"}
{"text":"Pizza today was really good. Service today was horrible just like my last visit.  The girl behind the counter was very rude. Mo social skills what so ever"}
{"text":"Poor Service at this location girls like to talk about boy friends pre ordered by phone to have ready and still had to wait on a small pizza for my granddaughter :( Manger was ask for and the little girl didn't say a word to him that we'd like to speak to him can't say that I'll be back any time soon"}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza is some of the best pizza I have had in a while! I just moved here from Chicago, so I know pizza and Barro's does it right. Also, the ranch dressing they have is phenomenal as well. Barro's is definitely my go-to place for pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Looking for an A-MAZING vegan pizza (sans cheese)?   Follow our formula at Barro's: Order a veggie special pizza with no sauce and no cheese Ask them to use the white pizza mix as the sauce (oil, herbs and garlic) Add a side of marinara sauce for crust dippin if desired  Result = Stupidly awesome vegan pizza. We loved it.  WARNING: It seems the \"white pizza mix\" may have Parmesan cheese in it. Not sure if it varies by location or not, but we've been given different answers at different locations. I suggest speaking with a Manager at the location you are ordering from to confirm this. We've had to ask for just olive oil, garlic and herbs as the base on a few occasions (rather than the \"white pizza mix\")."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised by the prior low star reviews of Barro's.  Barro's makes some damn good deep dish pizza. With lots of cheese, tasty sauce and a satisfying crust.  Awesome lunch specials keep the place filled mid-day. You can get a slice & a drink, a slice, a drink & a salad, 2 slices & a drink or other combos, all for around $4.  Pretty tough to beat, especially since their pizza is super tasty. Another pro includes some good house-made dressings (including ranch)."}
{"text":"I have no Idea what happened to this place,  I stopped using their delivery services months ago because the orders never arrived correctly, today is the last straw I went into the establishment and ordered a Medium Pizza to go, the wait time was not bad at all but when I got the pie home I understood why....the Pizza was so undercooked it was disgusting the Veggies to the Crust was all under cooked this has to be the worst Pizza that I  have ever had they should be ashamed to even serve something this terrible.  What make this so bad is I have gotten some pretty good pies from this establishment and I consider my a Pizza Connoisseur being originally from Chicago....unfortunately I will try Domino's before I return to Barro's.  Very Disappointed"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by those reviews stating this is \"the best pizza around.\"  If that is the case, we're all in trouble.  Having just arrived in the area, we took to Yelp to help us find a good local pizza place.  Sadly, the reviews narrowed it down to this and another option.  Apparently we chose the wrong one.  We ordered take out and upon arrival to pick up our order, we were greeted with inferior customer service the moment we stepped in the door.  As the employee went to grab our pizza to bring out to us, she noticed a glob of sauce on the bottom of the box and wiped it off with a napkin.  How sweet of her.  What she didn't bother to do is assess her performance as there was still a good amount of sauce on the box.  When asking for additional napkins so that we could finish cleaning up their mess, we were again treated as if we were bothering them.  Got the bottom of the box clean, now it's time to go! As we walking to the car, I switched the box from one hand to the other when I noticed this fine establishment also had slopped sauce all over the side of the box as well.  My sweatshirt was very thankful for this as it was now no longer hungry, having received a copious amount of pizza sauce.  Ok, now this place isn't looking too good. Finally, we arrive home hoping that the product can help alleviate the negative experience we've had thus far.  Unfortunately, things only got worse from here.  Checking out the breadsticks with cheese, at first glance they don't seem too bad.  However upon further review, it is quite apparent they are swimming in an Olympic pool sized amount of grease.  I probably would have been better off going to McDonald's kitchen and taking a straw to their fryer.  Alright, onto the pizza! Something has to be good, right? Wrong again, sucka!!! Once we opened the pizza box, it was quite apparent where my shirt received its serving size of sauce.  As far as taste, this pizza must be the best if you're into Pizza Hut or some other crap.  Heed this advice and HEAD ELSEWHERE!"}
{"text":"Great service and have always delivered in the time frame and the right order.  Can't go wrong with Barros.  This is some of the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend as it is close to the office. I believe this was their first business day. This is the spot where the Souper Salad, and a Gyros place used to be.  Service was good, the cashier was being trained but we were not in a hurry and we were cool with that. That is how we learn, right? We had the pizza combo lunch special, my friend had 2 cheese pizza slices, and I had a pepperoni and a day special or something like that slice. FYI, there is a 50 cents charge for the day special pizza. Mhmm... I don't remember the ingredients, but it had like a lot of finely chopped vegetables... it was good.  We also had mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce.  Portions were very generous and the prices are reasonable. It was cool to be here on their first day, everyone was very excited. They stopped by our table like 5 times to make sure everything was OK, I asked if they had jalapeños an they brought some to our table.  As we were getting seated, a patron was talking to one of the employees, he could be the manager, I guess. The patron said something like: I don't particularly care for pizza bread, but this one tastes really good. And I agree, the pizza crust was very tasty and I liked the texture too.  Overall it was very good, and I wish them the best of luck."}
{"text":"Ok guys:) food is great but make sure u know how big is extra large!!!! Their portion are really really big so for newbies look at the people eating around hehe iam going home with 3 boxes:)"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here but every time I come here I have a problem... The girls in the front are rude, my order is wrong or it takes 30 minutes for a small pizza when I'm one of two tables in the building...  UPDATE- the manager has gone out of his way to make a number of issues right... Unsuccessfully... But at least he tried."}
{"text":"I like this Barro's. I give them 4/5 because that's the number of pizzas that are delivered hot, fresh and tasty. About 20% taste like they are from the day before. I don't mind those odds. The girls who take the orders are nice. I once got a little douche nozzle delivery guy but again, this happens infrequently."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in the valley yet, plenty of cheese sauce and toppings. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Poor service, the kid  at the counter couldn't take an order from the customer in front of me, The customer wanted  triple chicken on his pizza, and the kid couldn't figure out how to ring it up, five minutes later he got the manager, by this time there was a huge line, it was really mind blowing to watch such untrained  person, any way they lost my business that night and for the future, I walked right out the door,and went to papa johns, Hate stupidity , !!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I called to place a take-out order and was asked to be put on hold. I held for only a moment, something I can understand through working in the restaurant business. I was told my food (wings) would be ready in about 20 minutes. I showed up and was told by two people behind the counter that they would be right with me. I paid for my meal and got to my car 15 minutes after placing my order over the phone. I really appreciate the service provided and the attention the busy employees provided. I also liked the fact that my food was ready even though the time they quoted was longer. Got my food home and it was great as usual (6 boneless honey BBQ wings and 6 boneless teriyaki wings). Food was great and service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"The interactions of office workers are a model for society at large; well-meaning, well-mannered individuals combine to form mindless, tactless mobs. This goes double for the IT business, where college-educated scholars emerge from their offices to congregate in basement computer labs to reclaim their primal triviality.   Passive aggressive intellectuals become territorial Luddites; arguments erupt over whose iPod is played over the speakers, whether to lift tables or drag them across the carpet, and whether or not making fun of my toe nail polish counted as gender discrimination.  When it came time for lunch, a caucus of Neanderthal-like rumbling came from our throats. Moments ago, we had all been connoisseurs of fine cuisine. But suddenly we clamored for culture-less layman food. Burgers. Subs. No. Pizza. PIZZA! PIZZA! WE WANT PIZZA! ORDER THE PIZZA GODDAMIT!  \"Well, what pizza should we get?\"  Pizza by Napoli. No, I don't like their crusts. Well, how about Pullano's? No. Too greasy. My sensitive tummy can't handle it.   \"How about Barro's?\"  What is this 'Barro's\"? Is it deep dish? Is it New York Style?   \"I really like it.\"  Well fine. But what should we put on it? Sausage. No. Extra cheese, I'm a vegetarian. No. Pineapple. Nobody likes pineapple, shut up. Pepperoni. Yes. Pepperoni. PEPPERONI!  A half hour later...  I like this Barro's, don't you? Yes. It's deep dish, but it's crispy. The crust is just the right amount of thickness. The toppings are generous, and there is plenty of cheese. Just good and bland enough to reach the status quo. We all approve. Hooray Barro's! This was a good lunch! Good job, whoever suggested this?  As soon as lunch was over, someone was hit in the face with a chair.   Your tax dollars at work."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas from here last night for carryout. Great phone service - very professional! We did the Mega meat & a pepperoni. Celeste was very friendly and appears to enjoy her job! Great staff here...always busy and working hard. Keep up the great work, we love our Surprise Barro's!"}
{"text":"Great affordable lunch specials! Nice saks bar and they actually ensure its stocked and clean."}
{"text":"I barely yelp as you see but pizza is always perfect my shout ..... I order pizza 3 times a year ..... maybe but I'm this idiot who has to have blue cheese when I do...... I order my pizza they forgot I'm that asshole that calls and says can I please have my blue cheese and you no what after call after hours they brought it!!!!!! Omg love this place hope I'm not sounding to needy but I love this place kids that work there management all!!!!"}
{"text":"Put in a Togo order and left for 15 min to grab some drinks at Safeway, was getting pizza and wings for the grandkids, got back to watch my order go out with someone else manger went to go after them, really after sending your food out the door with wrong person they would take it back and give to another ???? Health code violation big time, the manger said she was really really really sorry, had to wait another 15 min to re make manager promises 5 min but it was 15 also offered a free drink (that I just got) no discount on my order no offer to come back and have them try again? Crazy there's a lot of competition for pizza and wings don't think next time the grandkids come over for pizza and wings it will be from this place. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Visited last week The +'s - friendly staff, cool historic decor The -'a - prices have become out of line with the quality of food, not a true Chicago style pizza (either deep dish OR ultra thin)  I'd get them again but my family still prefers floridinos."}
{"text":"If your digestive system can't handle a lot of grease, Barro's is not for you.  Pizza was so-so....service was great."}
{"text":"This new location is true to the Barros pizza tradition! Super clean and same decor as other locations in the valley. I've been a fan of their doughy crust and zesty sauce for years now and finally one opened in my neighborhood. The staff is friendly too. I stopped by for a slice at lunchtime and it was quick and ready. Since it just opened, it wasn't busy at all. My only complaint is that the pizza seemed it maybe was sitting there for a while...because it wasn't that busy. Oh would be better if they had coke products. Overall a good experience and they'll probably get better with time. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"3 stars because this pizza is THE BEST and the employees are friendly.    Not 5 stars because the restaurant was a mess. They seemed understaffed. The salad was HORRIBLE (stick to pizza). And they had a major downgrade recently from coke to Pepsi. Which is so disappointing because most people prefer coke.   Overall I'd stick to take out rather than dine in."}
{"text":"I have come here many times since I moved here from Arkansas two years ago. It's my go to place for pizza. I will put more later"}
{"text":"This have to be my top favorite pizza joint in Arizona. The ingredients are top shelf unlike any other fast food pizza joint. I love there bread I even eat the crust! They have this awesome deal during lunch hours from 10:30 am to 2 or 3. You can order slices of pizza and a drink and these are pizzas that's been made 5-10 min ago sitting in a pizza warmer so it'll always be nice and hot. I normally get 3 slices of pizza and a drink for $6. Which is great compared to what my work place cafeteria is charging and for the quality of the pizza it's terrific.   You want something fast affordable and most of all good come to barros pizza for lunch or even take out."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised! The pizza and wings are amazing, probably some of the best I've had. The prices are decent, not too expensive. The service was good and we got our food fast. I would definetly come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and ended up massively disappointed after waiting over an hour for our sandwiches and wings. We ordered two Italian subs, both had an inexplicable amount of dressing on them... as in, the entire wrapper was filled with dressing and the bread was soaked, too to bottom, like it had been dunked the stuff. My sub also had several brown, slimy pieces of lettuce to top it all off. Gross."}
{"text":"Best lunch deals in the area! Amanda is an extremely hard worker and she remembers the orders of the regulars! :) Barros always made Fridays better!"}
{"text":"When in Rome, do as the Romans do, right? Out in Surprise, AZ there aren't to many independents to chose from but just about every chain you can think of. Including a new Barro's at the corner of Greenway and Reems which is just a mile from my bff's house.   They not only have a decent pizza but some of the meatiest wings Ive had in ages! We ordered the daily special which is a 1 topping, XL pizza and 24 wings, bone in or boneless for 23 bucks! We got a pepperoni and 24 honey bbq wings, bone in.. I love a good bone! Anyhoo..  Pizza is ample topped with thin slices of slightly oily pepperoni and has a chewy and slightly crispy crust. The wings are tender and the thick rich honey bbq taste was memorable. For 23 bucks and with the amount of leftovers, probably 2 meals, a real bargain. Plus the quality really seems to be there in both the ingredients and the friendliness of the staff.   I suppose I can consider myself a Roman now, wuff!"}
{"text":"The pizza is chewy and thick.. the toppings fresh and tasty.. the beer is ice cold and they have a few on tap from SanTan Brewery.. what better place to hang out after a shopping trip to Target?!   Short, sweet and to the point! Hows that for a Yelp review?"}
{"text":"Have had really good food and pretty bad food from here. Things like ordering side sauces and being wrong, messing up the sub order and even forgetting the 2L. Fast delivery and great food when it's right."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza I have ever eaten and at age 59 believe me I've had pizza. I got the bbq chicken pizza and added pepperoncini   and onions. My hubby  got pepporoni,sausage and mushroom. Both pizza's were hot and awesome. We added a dozen hot wings that were meaty and very good. If you want pizza and wings this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever eaten. We have done delivery and dined in. All the staff were very friendly and the place is very clean. Pizza Is delicious. You must have this pizza!!!! I love the bbq chicken with added onions and pepperoncini"}
{"text":"yum!!! seconding it reminding me of Jet's pizza from back home in Mich. really really good - and such a difference from the crap pizza we got used to in Boston."}
{"text":"The Pizza was great and the the pick up service was polite.  I look forward to going back there many times in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered out there for the first time. Great pizza. Chewy crust. Tangy sauce and perfect amount of ingredients.  Employees friendly, helpful, attentive and made a busy Saturday night enjoyable."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. I went there this evening and after waiting 30 minutes later than they told me my pizza would be ready, they gave my pizza to someone else on accident. Rather than apologizing, they were extremely rude. Would not recommend going here!!!"}
{"text":"Very average pizza.  Sorry.  Wanted to like it.  Just didn't care for it too much.  If you're dying for pizza, it'll do...it's just...very average.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"So, a bunch of guys from work and I went to go check this place out for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was good and the lady at the counter was friendly.   I had the Italian Sub and a drink, which was about average price ($8 and change). The sub was above average but I regretted  not getting the 2 slices of pizza and salad. Their salad bar looked good and for $6 and change, they got that deal with a drink. If you are going here for lunch, I would have to recommend going that route.   No one in our group had any real complaints and the meet lovers pizza looked fantastic. I know I will go back just to give that a try."}
{"text":"This Barro's  location is brand new and after talking to the manager for a little, I think it will be around for a long time. The staff is motivated, friendly, and wanting to succeed.   I had one of there many lunch specials, 2 pieces of pizza and a drink for $4! Hard to beat that deal anywhere. The pizza was fresh out of the oven, and were a decent size.   Like all other Barro's they do have a salad bar with is included with some of their specials if you would rather have a fresh salad. I enjoyed it and will be there for lunch again."}
{"text":"While our family enjoys and loves Barro's pizza, this location (our designated location/store) has been over 45 minutes late in delivering our order (2 pizzas and wings typically) on two separate occasions. Now, they have provided amazing customer service by refunding our order and then re-making our order, but they need to get more reliable delivery drivers. Otherwise, we love their food!!"}
{"text":"Took the kids here to show them that pizza from little Ceasar's or Pizza Hut doesn't compare to Barros at all. Got the XL pizza with breadsticks also. The pizza was hot as expected an tasted great. Not to mention the cheese was perfectly melted. And the breadsticks where great on the side as well. Can't say anything bad about the service or the food. I would highly recommend going to this place of business. Great food and service are always a plus as many places can't get the two together most of the time so 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"First time ordering.  Called in our order and it was ready as promised.  One of the BEST take out pizzas ever!!  Ordered Barros Specialty and it was loaded, I mean loaded with toppings and soooo cheesy!!  I saved the best for last, the crust.  Crisp and not soggy.  That is usually a make or break for us.  Perfection!  We'll be back....."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza,but good wings. So sad to see Barros losing the reputation of good pizza at an affordable price."}
{"text":"After living in Arizona for 40 years we decided to try Barro's a little over a week ago.   The food is so delicious we have been back four times now.  The first time we went three of us tried the pasta and the other two had the pizza.   Oh how delicious was our food.   I am Sicilian and have always made my own sauce but I have to say their sauce on the pasta was better than mine and mine is quite delicious too.  It was nice and thick and so tasty.  Their meatballs are scrumptous.    The pizzas are large and just perfect.   Our favorite so far is the Hot Wing pizza and also the Mega meat pizza.  It has bacon, ham, meatballs, pepperoni, and sausage.  The other night we also tried their salads.   I had a small and it was huge and tasty.  Love their garlic bread that comes with the pasta too.   So glad we finally tried this place.  It has a very comfortable and pleasant dining room too.  Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Always good here. Take the kids on early release from school Wednesday, and the pizza by the slice is always fresh and loaded. Best pizza chain in the area."}
{"text":"Overall good pizza and very good subs. The white pizza was underwhelming but everything else - yum!"}
{"text":"New to AZ and wanted to take a little trip from north scottsdale to cave creek. So half way into town I stopped for lunch at this little pizza joint and wow! This place is awesome! The manager was really nice and even showed me some off road trails near town. The pizza is super thick and cheesy the way it should I'm sick of all this health nut gym rat pizza  crap lol. Pizza is not a diet food so I want it good and cheesy and this place delivers just that! I can't wait to try it again! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings ever, been there about six times this month. Can't get my kids off the tasty wings,  Pizza is great not oily at all, over all it's just delicious and good on prices"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  We ordered a large green pepper and meatball thin crust pizza cooked well done and got a thick crust pepperoni undercooked pizza with burnt crumbles of meatballs.  We ordered traditional wings extra crispy. Fire sauce on side. Got undercooked wings smothered in sauce.   We ordered crispy boneless wings with garlic parmesan and got No sauce.  I called when I got home the girl was not concerned and said yeah your order wasnt right come back down.  I said it is raining I am I black canyon city and can't drive back down.  She said I will give you 12 free wings next time.  I said I am sorry but I just paid 40.00 for food that is not what we ordered. May I please speak to the owner.  Her reply. I am the manager.  The owner is never around.  I said could you leave a message for him to call me. She said I told you the owner is never around here.  She gave me a credit for large pizza and 24 wings for a future order after going back and forth.  The point was that We ordered to watch football and she was not apologetic.  I am hoping the owner will see this because we were regular customers who probably won't go back.wasted 40.00 to have to now cook instead of relaxing.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I feel kinda silly writing a review for Barro's, but I actually liked it.  Good selection of fresh toppings and ice cold beer.  Oh, and lot's of sports on TV's around the restaurant.  Great for kids and groups too."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I go for lunch here at least three times a week.  They have great pizza and big side salads that are quick and ready to go when you order.  Great meal prices and plenty of room to sit down and relax while you eat.  The staff is really nice too, remembering me and always cleaning up the tables promptly.  I'm a permanent happy customer!"}
{"text":"Barro's pizza will always be my favorite pizza for the great price it is. Highly recommend whether eating in or taking out. Try Barro's at least once."}
{"text":"The Laveen Barro's is definitely one of my favorite pizza places. The staff and servers are friendly and greet me as soon as they see me. I usually go with my friend but there are always several other patrons; families, groups, couples. It's pretty chill. The food is great! My order on demand is the veggie special with a side of honey hot wings. The cheese ravioli with meatballs is also amazing!  No negative words for Barro's"}
{"text":"This is a local Chicago pizza joint. We have gone here ever since we moved to Arizona, but service has gone down the past few years. The place has a high turnover rate and it is mostly run by kids, who don't really care all too much about the job.  Most of the cashiers seemed bothered by the customer's presence, or give you an attitude. However, the managers do care and make an effort when things go wrong. For example, we order a pizza, and It is missing a topping. So they offer the next pizza at a discount. Regardless, the same mistakes keep occurring which is frustrating. Also, the prices are average for this kind of restaurant. But we always order the same item, but each time we are charged a different price! How does that happen? We keep coming back because we hope that it will improve to the way it was a few years ago. We still enjoy the pizza itself, and the atmosphere is nice for a quick-serve. Also, the location is convenient and we enjoy supporting a local place."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has the best pizza, sub sandwiches and meatball spaghetti!!! This Barros Pizza in Laveen is also the most family friendly establishment!! Have visited other Barros, but this one is the best for family pizza night any night of the week. The staff is super friendly, the place is always clean and the food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with very good crust. I think they're wings are the reason I keep coming back though. Best pizza in Anthem"}
{"text":"This staff here are great! You can't go wrong with the Barros lunch specials! I usually get a slice, a fountain drink, along with the salad bar all for under 5 dollars! If that's not a good lunch deal, then I don't know what is.   This place is conveniently located on the south east corner of reems and greenway rd    In the bribing pod Walmart parking lot. Parking is never an issue here. Like it is at most other Barros around lunch time. I really like how big it is inside also.   I finally found the courage to try their buffalo chicken pizza.. And man I need to tell you it was absolutely amazing! I am definitely get it again over my usual pepperoni slice! The salad bar here is also very good. They have a nice selection that is always well maintained and kept fresh. Like I said you get a good meal for under $5 I think that's pretty epic!   Keep up the great work guys and girls of Barros on reems and greenway!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Barros in the valley.. This location has their stuff together!   They also seem to keep up with the busy lunch rush, I have never had to wait for a pie to come out of the oven. I can usually get in and get a couple slices no hassle! No waiting!  The staff here are very upbeat and friendly. They greet you as a guest as if they were welcoming you into their personal home. It's a great thing to see and experience when it seems as if every staff member appreciates their position here.   PLENTY OF SEATING! Another frustrating down fall of other locations is either small location, and or not enough seating. Here that is not the case! This please is well put together and designed!  I am very happy this location is just Dow. The road from my work, and should like to see someone challenge my Dukedom here!!"}
{"text":"Their food is always good, but they need help with service. They always get orders wrong and they are never friendly. You walk in there and they treat you like you are an inconvenience.  I've tried numerous times and it never ends well. I just ordered $75.00 worth of pizza and wings, get there to pick up and the order is wrong. The manager gives me a discount, but that doesn't help when I have people at my house waiting. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Always fresh and delicious :) great service as well. Only pizza place my husband will eat at. Eating it at the restaurant is a lot better than getting it to go. Taste so much better right when it comes out of the oven. Definitely recommend Barros Pizza!"}
{"text":"Although I would actually like to give it zero stars, Aaron (I'm assuming the manager) was very nice so he alone allowed the one star to be given. We ordered at 5:07 (24 wings) and it said it wld take 55 minutes to receive our order via delivery. I sit here at 7:23 still waiting for wings - and that is after I called twice and the manager called me once. So after THREE calls to and from Barro's, I am still wingless. This last time I talked to him, he stated they would be making us new fresh wings and will be sending them out so cross your fingers for me that sometime in the next half hour, we have edible wings that we approve of.  When I spoke to the manager at 6:32, he decided to refund us for the wings and said they would be here as they were en route at that time. When I called back again at 7:08, he apologized again and said they would make fresh new wings and send them straight over. We shall see!"}
{"text":"My first impression wasn't great. We could barely get in the door due to all the people waiting to order and pick up. You order at the front and then seat yourself. Our second issue arose when the drink dispenser was out of ice. It took them a good 20 minutes before they got ice into the machine. The food was good but not great."}
{"text":"Never again coming back to this Barro's Pizza. Horrible customer service again - the girls in the from are more interested in gossiping between each other than assisting customers.  We came here a few weeks ago and ordered a pizza took almost an hour to get after I went up and asked THREE times about it. There was one other family in the building.  We came back today to give it another go, again one other family to order that came in AFTER us and 1 other man ordered a pizza and a side. We ordered the slices of pizza so we didn't have to wait an hour for Pizza. I also ordered an Sicilian Salad with chicken, thinking it's a salad it won't take long... it's been 24 mins as I type this....guess what still no Salad.   Both times we have came with a little one just under two. Last time we had to ask for our pizza Togo, this time he is done eating and I still haven't gotten to eat, again now taking my food Togo.   Also the guy that order a pizza and a side TWO people after me, just got his items and left.   Fantastic!   Its just a Salad....with already made meats!  Edit. Asked for an update on my salad after 27 mins, it finally had been brought out while I was talking to the girl. Asked them to box it up because now we had a little one that needed nap time. Took another 7 mins to get boxed up.  34 mins for a basic salad..."}
{"text":"The place is practically run by teenagers. So-so service, and food is okay.  You order at the cashier, they give you a number, and then they deliver the food to you. Problem is, they bring it as it's done, not as you'll want it. Ordered Wings and Pizza with another couple. They got their wings we got nothing so we got to watch them eat. We then got our wings... they got to watch us, then they got their pizza, and we got our pizza. Woulda been nice to get them all at the same time.  Great place if you're dropping off a bunch a kids after a baseball game for just some pizza. other than that... I'd stay away."}
{"text":"Not too happy with the take out. After spending $45. We ordered thin crust mega meat pizza, large salad and boneless chicken. When they were delivered, the pizza was thick doughy and extremely salty.  The chicken were wet and soggy!!! salad was like week old!!!"}
{"text":"The service at this Barros is great. We have always gotten our food real fast and it is always fresh. The Barros special pizza is the best. The wings are always great. They have TVs going to keep you entertained. I also like how they have a separate kids area so there are not tons of rugrats running around. They also have awesome lunch specials where you can get pizza by the slice and a drink for super cheap."}
{"text":"Ordered 24 wings and all of them came in one box......When I say they came in one box all of the wings were wet and falling apart. You basically needed a fork to eat these things. I called the MOD (manager on duty) and he wanted to send a fresh delivery of wings out to me. I thought that was awesome however after seeing their first attempt I had to pass. To many restaurants out here to wait for you to get your specs right. Wings ....Horrible.....Customer service....Top notch...."}
{"text":"Love Barros pizza.  I've eaten at a couple of different locations and it was really good."}
{"text":"So first off I am extremely picky about my pizza, and this place nailed it. I was up in mesa for a motorcycle meet up, and the locals recommend this place, so we took off down the road. We got here and it was almost like a bar vibe, with the self seating and walking up to order. I told my local friend to get what she thought was good. She got some kind of meat pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ham and something else I believe. All I can say is it was amazing. I had to stop myself from eating more, but its hell to ride a bike so full. The service took a while even though they were not busy, but worth the wait. All in all, I recommend this place if your in town, so good!"}
{"text":"Two strikes and this place is out!   Strike one: the piece of meat on each of their sandwiches is insultingly minuscule.   Strike two: Management has failed to train their employees adequately.  Their customer service stinks!   It's no wonder the place is routinely conspicuously empty."}
{"text":"This place gets (5) stars from me because they are kid friendly and the pizza is delish. I had my sons 3rd birthday there and the employees were so nice and accomodating. They let me keep my sons cake in there refrigerator until it was that time. I also love the wings. Still crunchy but saucey as well. Yum."}
{"text":"This pizza was absolutely delicious ! I order a Medium vegetarian pizza , holy smokes it was huge! Total deal for the price you pay."}
{"text":"This pizza is great! Thin crust is the way to go! I could eat so much of this pizza. The cheese is excellent! The crust is good. The sauce is very flavorful! Try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this Barro's Pizza, but we order delivery from there all the time. I'm very happy with the delivery time frame and the quality of food when we order. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The manager Colton is great at customer service! We ordered 24 boneless wings for pickup and when we came home we found they were bone in. We called and Colton apologized then offered to remake our order AND get it delivered. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"We love thick crust pizzas & Barro's has the best!  We have been getting take-out from them for 3 years & have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Well you know it is really funny that there is a Barro's Pizza very close to where I live and I have NEVER been to it. However this location is right across the street from where I work....so I decided to give it a try one day for lunch. I had the Mozzarella Sticks and a slice of Cheese pizza. The prices are not to bad I paid a 1.75 for the slice and 3.25 for the Mozzarella Sticks. The Pizza is good as long as you eat it while it's hot.....as for the Sticks well they were just okay.....Sonic has much better tasting Sticks. This is not a bad location at all for lunch and it is affordable....so I would recommend at least trying it once and see how you like it. Now as for myself I probably won't be back unless I try a specialty pizza or if I decided to buy one for my staff. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Really a 3 and half.  It's pizza, it's Phoenix.  And they deliver.  Still, the best pizza I've had in Arizona.  Coming from NY, I had to force myself to give it this rating.  Back east, it would get 2 stars at best."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  Had a large Kona pizza. Even though my Hawaiian friend didn't approve of the toppings, I thought it was delicious. The dough is what makes it, IMO. Also had some cheese bread sticks which were awesome.  Thanks for changing my mind about Chicago style pizza, Barro's!"}
{"text":"I gave the 3 stars only because the girl who took our order for \"dine in\" was knowledgeable and courteous. There was definitely something wrong with the pizza. I think it was the crust. I didn't even finish my first piece. I just pulled the topping off. My son was starving so he ate his fill complaining that crust tasted weird. He suffered later tho'. He was up all night with severe stomach cramps going to the restroom repeatedly. No good."}
{"text":"I eat at Barros all the time all over the valley and this has to be the worst location. For lunch the lunch specials are .50 cents more than the west valley. I know it's two brothers I guess one is greedy over the other. Every time I get slices here they are always over cooked and cold. There is no quality assurance at all the other ones I goto the manager always comes by and asks how everything is this one just has some flirty girls to take your order and stand around and talk to each other instead of making sure the tables are clean in the dinning area. Eat here if you may but I wouldn't recommend it and I have tried over 10 times to get good pizza here."}
{"text":"Location close to my job always a go to for lunch. Husband and I had the basic some pizza and wings nothing too exciting calm location not a lot of people which was good because the wait was short . The bathrooms could use some more TLC. Staff was nice and courteous. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place! Pizza is on point and try the cheesy breadsticks! The pizza has a perfect proportion of every ingredient cheese, sauce, and bread! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sad example of a Hawaiian pizza !  Way too much cheese. hardly any ham  hardly any pineapple $21 think it's time to start ordering somewhere else Barro's  used to be good. used to be !"}
{"text":"We used to order sausage parm sandwiches which were to die for.. Then out of the blue Barro's said they no longer offer sausage and that it was a 'Corporate decision'..This is an Italian restaurant, how idiotic is this!  In terms of other food at Barro's it's terrible, greasy, tasteless pizza, dirty/scummy salad bar, limited menu. We won't be back! Ick!!!"}
{"text":"Our family quickly fell in love with Barro's upon moving to Arizona about a year ago. This particular location - although beautiful, spacious, and clean - often disappoints. In addition to long waits, they do not have an open salad bar. This location does a solid job on delivery with every delivery order having been 100% correct and timely."}
{"text":"I moved to mesa from northern California a year and a half ago. My favorite pizza place in California was roundtable and I've been searching for something comparable since I moved here but have had zero luck. I finally found it at barros! I've drove by 100 time but finally tried it this weekend. The sauce is a sweeter sauce but the crust and pepperoni comparable. It was very cheesy and cooked just right. The restaurant was nice and clean inside. We got our pizza to go and were offered a glass of water while we waited which was nice. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza restaurants in town. Great tasting pizza, sandwiches and wings.  It's clean and friendly and a great value.  Great place for team parties group meetings.  Our go to pizza joint for sure"}
{"text":"I love Barro's.  Always clean and the food is fantastic.  The price is as good as the food.  The Manger Mike is great guy and wants to make sure everything is done just how you like it. We recently went over 250 pizzas ordered!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this place nearby!  We love the boneless wings!  Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Super consistent and reasonable prices.  The pizza is pretty good and the wings are slightly better than average.  I like that they don't skimp on the pizza toppings.  This has become our local pizza place.  Just make sure u ask for extra sauce on the wings."}
{"text":"Barros Pizza is excellent.  This is the first time at this location.  It's very clean,  friendly staff,  and consistently awesome thin crust pizza.  Service was great as they continued to check on our table. Will be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Love Barros pizza  and all they do for the community as a local family business.  But today's 4th of July  pizza for the family was inedible. Ordered thin crust pepperoni with extra sauce. Didn't inspect it at pick up and got home for disappointment. Wow!  The staff was friendly and phone order was easy, just disappointed with the pizza and with quality check failed today."}
{"text":"\"We don't do that.\" - Barro's counter helper when asked on a Sunday evening when we were the only patrons sitting down to eat if she would turn up the TV and turn off the closed captions on the football game. This is a place that serves pizza, wings and beer and could be begging for a huge crowd on a Sunday. But nope, we can't accommodate your request. Although she did at least turn it from the weather to the game for us. We changed our order from dine in to 'to go' and left. The pizza had a wonderful amount of toppings but didn't appear to be the thin crust that we had ordered and we asked for the wings to be half medium and half hot but although they were boxed separately they seem to be the same. We should have asked for a manager when we were told 'no' but we just decided to write a sad review instead. The restaurant was empty, by the way. Except for people picking up orders to go. I wonder why people don't stay?"}
{"text":"I've always loved their pizza and wings! I've never been disappointed it is my go to for sure :)  Today it was different a GOOD different. I needed a receipt that was misplaced by our dental office and I needed to submit it to my accounting team. So I called Barros and first talked to a very nice girl on the phone (wish I remembered her name) then she said let me get my manager he will be able to find that receipt a lot quicker. I was on hold for a few seconds and I spoke to the manager (wish I remembered his name too). He immediately found the receipt and I had it in my email within minutes! They were so fast and happy to help me. They have a great team, and most importantly they delivered GREAT customer service. THANKS :)"}
{"text":"Completely unorganized staff who are not trained in customer service. I arrived to pick up my takeout order and had to wait 20 minutes before they told me they didn't have the sauce I ordered for my wings. I sat  and listened to them argue about who was going to call me to tell me about the sauce not being available. When they finally asked who I was they scrambled to figure out what to do. I was given a portion of my money back but ended up having my pizza held warm as I waited for the wing situation to be resolved. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time this has happened. We used to order pizza from this location every Friday but I think we will be looking for a new \"go to\" pizza place."}
{"text":"Well I just got home with another screwed up order from the worst Barros pizza in the state AGAIN.  This place is dirty filthy every time we go. If you order ANYTHING to go check it BEFORE you leave because you probably don't have what you ordered. Nothing like bringing home the wrong dinner to your hungry family. This would be a great location to open a pizza/wings/salad place. Zero stars if possible"}
{"text":"Movie night and Barro's go hand in hand at my house.  It's a much better option to the three evils - Papa Johns, Domino's and Pizza Hut.  Great service, fast delivery, good pizza, delicious wings AND they give you plenty of ranch without asking you to pay extra.  I wish they would change their specials once in a while though."}
{"text":"We use Barros for the go to when it comes time for catering our work meetings and trainings. Management is easy to work with. Plus I love their delivery service for lunch. It's wonderful. Thanks for great service and we look forward to using you again soon."}
{"text":"Always consistent pizza and wings.  The management is great!  One night after work I was headed home and called 10 minutes before they closed.  The manager made my order of naked well done wings and was very delightful that I gave them business.  I have ordered from this location several times and always had great food and service.  I have not dinned in only done take-out and the customer sercive again is great!  This is one of the only places that I know you can have a great meal close to closing time."}
{"text":"Makers of my favorite pizza in town, with delicious thick crust, tasty sauce and fresh mozzarella.  I often stop by this location to grab a pizza on my way back from work for an awesome way to finish a busy day.  I'm a bread lover and the dough at all Barro's locations is fabulous.  I particularly like the mushroom toping, it's a treat.  I don't often eat in, so can't say much about their service beyond their typical 15-minute handling time from call to pickup."}
{"text":"This might be my least favorite for the lunch pizza. Maybe they are not as busy as others, but the pizza is just not as fresh.   I have been here a couple of times and both times I thought the same thing.   Secondary the staff at lunch is lazy. There was no one cleaning at all. In fact a customer spilled her drink and she cleaned it herself. (they were not busy)"}
{"text":"The last 2 times I've come in between 12 and 130 in the afternoon. They had no pizza. I ordered they said they world bring it out. They never do.  It was 12 min later I walked back up and they're checking the cell phones,  while my pizza was Chillin on the Warmer. The time before I never got it.  Had to take it to go.    Like I said this has been 2 times in a couple months.   Management is always hiding in back.  Perhaps making pizza who knows.    No impressed by the staff here."}
{"text":"Bigger and cleaner then I remembered. They must have expanded.   The lunch special was perfect 2 slices and a drink for 5 bucks or so.   The staff was nice and quick too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. I ordered a pizza, showed up when I was told. After I paid, I was informed that the pizza was not there. Problem could of been solved pretty easy but no the cashier took 5 minutes trying to figure out where the pizza went. Hello that is not the customers problem. So after waiting twenty more minutes during the afc championship game...pizza finally comes. Do I get an apology?...no. did they offer me a even a glass of water while I waited?...no. so I confront the manager on duty and he said she (one of 4 teenager girls working) should of given me 20% off next time. Why does he think there will be a next time! It sucks because I like Barros but I am laying off this one for a while. Worst thing is when I get home, my pizza is lacking cheese and toppings on one whole slice & another slice also has slightly to no toppings. Wtf! Here I come Nello's."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch pizzas I have ever had. The crust was slightly less cooked then other Barros. I loved it. Everything else was n par. The staff the building the booths ALL good."}
{"text":"Barros..  I cannot find a better pizza.   This branch seems to be a little \"cheaper\" perhaps on the ingredients. Other places like 59th or Lk Pleasent seems to serve bigger, better slices for lunch."}
{"text":"Have been to this Barro's Pizza many times and have been a customer for years......and yet today.....treated extremely rude by manager! Lost a customer ....won't be back! Telling all my friends to go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing every time I go. Everyone that works there is always very nice.   The manager John always remembers my kids names. Any time we go out to eat pizza we always go to Barros. Last year my family came out from Chicago and they said that this was the closest they've had to the pie back home.   We will continue to come to Barros because it is by far the best!"}
{"text":"I was craving garlic bread the other day and hit up my Yelp app to find a place close to my job. I'd seen signs for Barros before but had never tried so I threw it into my GPS and headed out. Unfortunately, the address found on Google and on Yelp directs you to the middle of the road, a place from where you cannot actually see the business. Fortunately (unfortunately?) this is a common occurrence if you've never been, but anyone you ask in the area (Shell Station) can get you to the right location. When you first walk into this location, it looks very nice and has the feel of a nice bar or pub, except it's a pizza joint. The smell of the freshly cooked pizza is wafting through the air and smells absolutely incredible. After we joke about the misadventures of people trying to find the place and I order some cheese garlic bread, I give in to the aroma and order a slice of pepperoni. Waiting for the garlic bread to be made, I had to try a slice of the pizza, mostly cuz I was so very hungry at that point and also because I wanted to try it at its freshest instead of waiting for when I returned to work. I have to say, hands down, this was the best slice of pizza I've ever had. The ratio of cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and bread were on point, cooked to perfection. The crust itself is also amazing. Fantastic job, standing ovation! I finally got my garlic bread, thanked everyone, and headed back to work. Once inside the car, the smell emanating from the to go bag was nearly intoxicating. I've never smelt such divine garlic bread. I may have rushed a little back to work so I could immediately take a bite. I popped open the lid once I got back to my desk and it looked like normal garlic bread but, when I took a bite, it was anything but normal. Again, hands down, the best garlic bread I have ever had. I've been so disappointed lately in the garlic bread around town but Barros has renewed my hope that someone out their knows how to great fantastic garlic bread. I will be going here from now own for all my pizza and garlic bread needs. Thank you."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and fast. Plus I love the pizza by the slice option for lunch. $4 for two pieces and a drink? Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Okay pizza for the price and service is usually good.  place is very clean and the area for kids is very nicely set up. The only reason for three stars is 1)when taking pizza home for a party I found the pizza to be a total soggy puddle of cheese and sauce in the middle - it's not usual here but it wasn't edible except around the outside- they should have never let this leave their kitchen and 2) the lunch salad portion was less than half a bowl full of lettuce. It needed less than a quarter of the dressing provided it was so tiny. But, it's cheap pizza near our house and we do still plan to eat it when we have good coupons. I'll just not forget to check the box before leaving ever again!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Been so many times. Always great. Love the boneless wings and original crust!"}
{"text":"Love Barros pizza- so for that I give them 4 stars. Everything we've ever ordered here is always very good and tasty. the only reason I give 4 and not 5 is service is always the least friendliest and at most time rude every time I call to order for delivery or pick up- always rude. Barros quality keeps us coming back though :)"}
{"text":"The people working there are ridiculously on able to deal with Society little loan people there is only 3 things for kids to play and they each cost a dollar and if you get them to deliver it's always cold save your money go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Barro's pizza looks like a chain, smells like a chain and may even feel like a chain (ahem - I didn't \"feel up\" anyone, I am talking about the ambiance) BUT THEY ARE NOT A CHAIN!!  Their pizza taste way better than any chain pizza joints!!  This particular Barro's is very good! Fantastic service ~ friendly, fast and eager to please.  They are also consistent from visit to visit.  They have a good selection of pizza's to choose from but don't let stop you from getting creative with your order.  They will accommodate even the most finicky pizza peeps and will make what ever type of pizza your craving.      Some of favorite pizza's that Barro's cooked very well: Cheese pizza ~ extra cheesy goodness, my son loves it!  Their meaty pizza is also a fav of ours.   If your wanting a pizza and your in Anthem, this is the place to go!!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Prestige service- they were SUPER jammed- understandable, all three girls were on the phone taking orders, but everyone who came from the back completely ignored us.. ok but the lil dark haired chick was a boss and got one of them to take our order, gave us free drinks and we just opened our bag to an extra meatball sub!! That's service! This goes out to the lil dark haired chick!"}
{"text":"For your lunch special needs, Barros is a pretty good option. Coming in at $2 a slice between a few different pizza slice options, and very decent pizza.   I've tried their cheese, pepperoni, and bbq chicken, and all were good. A 25 cent drink is a great additional deal as well. I feel much better dropping $4.25 here for a quick lunch as opposed to any fast food (for the same amount or more) that comes to mind. Taste-wise, better than most pizza places in it's weightclass."}
{"text":"We waited 4 HOURS!  Worst service ever!  They continued to tell us it would be coming, once it will be here in 20 min after we waited an hour and a half.  Another hour goes by and we are told 10 min.  Then another hour goes by and they said 2 hours ago they had already came by and no one was here?  WHAT?  Are you kidding me?  We continued to ask to speak to a manager and they wouldn't put one the phone.  Awful service.  In the past they were late a lot, but this tops it, especially when they continued to tell us it was on its way.  We will NEVER ORDER FROM THEM again, and we will make sure WE LET EVERYONE KNOW HOW AWFUL THEIR SERVICE IS!!"}
{"text":"Good daily specials and lunch/express menu.  Family friendly.  You order at the counter.  If you order off of the regular menu, they bring food to the table.  Food comes out fresh and hot.  Drinks are self-serve.  Salad bar available.  They also have pasta, wings, and sandwiches.  The atmosphere is great casual pizzeria atmosphere IMO...just dark enough without being too dark, a TV with sports on that makes it just loud enough, especially if you have young children, and comfy booths available.  To be honest it's not our favorite pizza, but it's one of our favorite \"sit-down\" pizza joints because of the atmosphere, value, variety, and service."}
{"text":"My family loves dining here. Our kids can play while we can enjoy lunch or dinner. The pizza is wonderfully hot & cheesy. We love the honey hot wings,  although they have switched wings because they used to be much meatier. That is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Had a few challenges with my order however they are normally very reliable.  I heard from the owner and there were a few minor training issues.  Overall, we really like Barro's and will definitely remain loyal customers."}
{"text":"Barro's it's probably one of the best pizzas around also the hot wings are great not as good at Buffalo wild wings but close.I find Barro's  thin pizza is probably the best choice because of the quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I've lived in Glendale for 17 years now and finally ordered a delivery pizza from this location, I think it was the best pizza I ever had delivered to me!  The wings were thick and juicy and the Buffalo wing medium sauce was perfect.  I had a large hand-tossed Barro's special with anchovies.  Yes anchovies, everyone pretty much hates them but me I guess but this pizza place has them AND green olives topping too, all hard to find toppings with the usual pizza places.  I give this place 5 stars and will definitely order again.  Great pizza, great wings."}
{"text":"Been here many times and never disappointed in their pies. Tonight we had their original crust pepperoni with extra cheese and also their original crust kona pizza that comes with their sweet sauce, chicken and cheese. Both as usual were very good and flavorful. In addition to pies, we ordered their honey hot and medium wings. I absolutely love their honey hots. The mediums were fine but not hot at all and would definitely go with hot in the future. Also, as mentioned, we did boneless tonight for the first time and I would recommend their bone in in the future. All in all though, it is currently my favorite pizza and wing joint in the far west valley."}
{"text":"Love this place hands down some of the best pizza ever !!! Great deals and amazing pizza - I always order to go"}
{"text":"This is yummy pizza loaded with toppings. The crust is thick and tasty. Service was fast. The red-haired fellow at the counter was cool and helpful. Everyone here was friendly. We got the extra large and they gave me a Veteran's discount."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Location is nice and looks like it would be a fun place to dine in. Quick service and friendly staff. Your basic Barro's pizza not much different from all the other ones!"}
{"text":"The pizza was loaded with toppings and I was impressed with the taste. Usually, I'm into the really fancy pizza, but the taste of Barro's  is a good competition to them given their price point and size. :)  I may just skip Papa John's from now on."}
{"text":"The service was decent. We ordered quite a lot of pizzas so it got here in a little over an hour. Although the girl on the phone kept messing up the order or spelling things wrong and kept asking to repeat things.  The pizzas were $12.75 for two toppings. I think it's moderately prices although it was $2.75 per topping added. Not thrilled about that.  We needed pizzas and we got them. So it's A-OK with us since we needed them delivered while in downtown Mesa. We were not going to call Domino's or Pizza Hut. Although, I think Papa John's might have been cheaper and taste a little better."}
{"text":"There used to be a time when neighborhood pizza shops outnumbered the chains, but it seems that's reversed. So last night, when my four-year-old said he wanted pizza at a place where we ate there (as opposed to take-out), I was stumped. Then, while driving near our house, we passed Barro's. From the outside, it barely looked open due to the poor lighting, and it definitely looked like a neighborhood \"dive,\" so I was hoping for something yummy.  This is a no-frills pizza joint, to be sure. When we walked in and were greeted by high school/college gals, I told them we wanted to eat there. I was educated on their process: order at the counter, sit down, and your pizza is brought over. Okay, no problem.  Barro's has pizza sizes ranging from mini to extra-large, which immediately made me happy. My son likes cheese only (he's four), and I like a little more variety, so I ordered a mini cheese for him, a small for me with tomatoes, olives, and mushrooms, and a couple of drinks. We then sat down to await the yumminess.  I could tell that many of the patrons were regulars. For a Saturday night, it was pretty dead, and most of the folks eating in were either families or couples. Mostly old-style booths with serve-yourself everything, the love here goes into the food and service. Our pizza arrived pretty quickly, and while my son waited for his to cool, I dug in.  I have one word: delicious! Doughy, soft crust, just the right amount of toppings, and a wonderful taste greeted me. Topped with some Parmesan and chili flakes, it was amazing. My son ate a whole piece as well, which is rare for him. For my part, I polished off half of my six-piece pie.  After the meal, we visited the ice cream machine, where my son picked a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich, which we enjoyed there before heading home.  I will be visiting Barro's more often. It's now my neighborhood go-to pizza joint."}
{"text":"The brand has gone down hill.  Crispy wings come soggy, the salads have less to offer than a drive thru at McDonalds.   The pizzas aren't often cooked evenly, and thoroughly.     I don't know if the family doesn't care anymore, or if in their quest for building a chain, they  lost track, but the feeling is simply no one cares there.     The Gold Standard in the valley is Nello's pizza.   If you go there, you get an incredible meal every time.   After that is Venizia's pizza, they care and try hard to make a great meal.   Barro's has become an expensive version of Pizza Hutt."}
{"text":"Every location I've been to has amazing pizza! The lunch deals are great and wait times are short. I wish they didn't charge for their ranch."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are pretty good for a chain. They also have a large amount of gluten free options. We carried out pizza from here on my visit to Arizona, so I can't speak to dining in the restaurant. The interior is nice, with classic elements of a bar/pizza place.  I had the pan crust meat lovers. The crust was cooked excellently, with a little bit of char to it. The amount of toppings was generous for a chain. The toppings were fairly fresh, not canned like a lot of places.   They had our order ready right on time and were very friendly. Overall, much better than Pizza Hut or Dominos."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's mom ordered some Barro's Pizza for us one time, and I ordered again at our place. It pretty much tastes like Jet's Pizza from back home, and I love it. Lots of cheese and the crust is nice and soft. The prices are very reasonable too--there is always specials and coupons floating around."}
{"text":"This Barros used to be on the corner of Hardy and Baseline just up the road in a less attractive shopping center. It's now in a more luxurious place but food and service seem to be as good as it was.   Barros uses real chicken breast, doesn't skimp on toppings and offers a good variety of specialty pies.  Bbq chicken pizza, hot wing pizza and a southwest style pizza are among its offerings. It also serves beer (at least in in its last location).   Barros is a place better served to eat in than take out. The place doesn't have many tvs, but there always seem to be a game on during weekends and salad bar prices are fair.   Food usually comes out fairly quickly and it's consistent from one time to the next. It never seems to be too crowded either because so many people order their pies to go.   Just a good place to relax and eat Chicago-style pizza with fresh ingredients and watch a game."}
{"text":"What can I say...I love pizza and especially Barro's pizza. The delivery time was outstanding, it only took 10 minutes for its arrival. The only thing better than the delivery time was the pizza itself. I've been called a purist because I enjoy a good only fashion pepperoni pizza, plain and simple. Barro's came through as usual and provided a slice of heaven. The pizza was fresh and hot, which meant that it didn't last long.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the prices are a little above the average price for similar pizza, but the pizza was definitely worth it.   This isn't my first Barro's pizza and it definitely won't be the last."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap prices, decent delivery time. We will order again."}
{"text":"My father is in a nursing home and asked if he could get a pizza delivered.  I called the Barro's closest to him but their phones weren't working.  I called this location and Rachel put me on hold and tried the number herself.  She said it was indeed not working.  She said she had the cell phone # of the mgr. at that location and she would take my order and then call and make sure my father was taken care of.  In less than a 1/2 hour my father had his med. barro's special plus anchovies.  My father hadn't had his favorite pizza in years.  He called and was so happy with everything.  It's nice to know that there are still employees out there that go above and beyond for their customers.  Thanks Rachel for making my Dad's day."}
{"text":"We are renovating a house nearby, so we have dinner here about once a week because it's quick, tasty, reasonably priced, and my 4 year old loves the cheese bread. What more could you want?  The dining area is huge, so we've always been able to find a table. They have a lot of TVs on the walls, so it's easy to find something to watch. If the staff isn't busy, they have no problem changing the channel or turning on captioning on a nearby TV.  The only thing I wish this location had is a salad bar like the one by Luke AFB. The salads on the menu are good, but sometimes it's nice to dish up your own."}
{"text":"We love barrows pizza. The crust is perfect and it's very consistent. Always fast and they put lots of toppings. The mushrooms are super tiny so they could improve on that but otherwise I love the pizza."}
{"text":"terrible customer service...never got to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Delivery review:  Thursday night at 9pm.  Pizza came average time. Not too fast, not too slow.  Pizza is good. Has thick crust.  Boneless Wings were the size of quarters!??  Kids ate it the next day ? ( I don't actually know if that's a compliment or not?! Haha!)"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are always a great thing here. The pizza always hits the spot and of course, the price is just right! I've only had one unpleasant experience but they listened to me, implemented my feedback and I was right back to enjoying my pizza pie!"}
{"text":"We go to Barro's every few weeks.  This is the first time we went to this location.  We asked for light sauce on one side, and normal sauce on the other.  We got no sauce on one side, and very light sauce on the other.  When I mentioned it to a young woman who works there, she just said, \"sorry about that.\".  She said it sincerely, but we had to then ask for some sauce, which she didn't offer.  We got some cold sauce in little to go containers.  There were also less mushrooms than we are used to.  Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"We have always had Barro's pizza delivered so don't have any input on the restaurant itself.  However, their pizza is always great and delivered on time.  My son always requests it on pizza night!"}
{"text":"Come here often with family.  Great pizza.  Great service.  2-3 TV's on normally with sports."}
{"text":"My family and I love Barros pizza!  All of the pizza is delicious but our favorite is the sausage and mushroom pizza. When I call in to place an order I never have to wait on hold, they take my order quickly and are always polite and helpful.  I find it just as easy when we go there to eat. The atmosphere is family friendly and comfortable.  There are TV's with sports on for the adults and one with a show for the children. There is even a play kitchen to keep them occupied and small tables and chairs for them to eat at with friends. It's a great place to go as a family or with a group of other moms to have lunch and where kids can eat and play!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best regular old fashioned American style pizza place anywhere.   No; goat cheese, truffle, arugula pesto,  free range, heirloom, organic, farm to table shtick  just regular old pizza done well. There will be no James Baird nominations here, but there will be happy kids, softball teams etc.  This is what happens when a classic pizza place sticks to the basics and doesn't change because it's fashionable.  This place has been around since the 80's and I'm happy to say still going strong.   Don't get me wrong I do appreciate other styles of pizza places, but if you just want some slices without any gimmicks this is the place.  If they ever think of franchising out to Seattle, I will quit my job and open one in a heartbeat, so I can bring their pizza to the PNW."}
{"text":"Good Pizza! We've been long time customers and the service and pizza is always constant. We've done carry out and have eaten it there. If you want yummy pizza you've found your place."}
{"text":"Never have we had this problem. When we got our pizza tonight it wasn't cut. Frustrated. ?"}
{"text":"Great having another pizza option in the neighborhood. I can't say this was something to rave about but it was satisfying enough. New location, means new staff, and some kinks to work out."}
{"text":"I've searched the world for the perfect pepperoni pizza.  I've searched it over and over again.  Damn it man!  I've wasted my life searching and searching to the farthest corners of the earth to find that saucy cheesy meaty delite!  Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barro's,  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up.  I loathe you, you tasty cheesy bastards...oh, and can I have a large pepperoni to go?"}
{"text":"Good pizza! However, if you enjoy lukewarm pizza than have it delivered. I recommend picking it up if you like it hot."}
{"text":"Best.pizza.ever. I am in love with Barros, their food is always fresh and delicious, way better in flavor than other chains and probably better than most mom and pops. i will never eat pizza from another place, it doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. I think they are a little chintzy on the toppings. But still tastes good. The staff is very friendly. It gets a little busy at lunchtime. I've found my new pizza place."}
{"text":"Went to a party at this Barro's. Pizza was fine. Salad bar was nothing to write home about. Service was pretty good. It's alright!"}
{"text":"We were given a 1.75 hour delivery wait and we're about a mile away. So, decided to go pick it up. Not what you want to do on a hot day when you just arrived from driving a moving truck across the county, but that's another saga. Other than that, the food was fine. Nothing spectacular. It'll do. The only reason we chose it was for delivery and that didn't work out."}
{"text":"I just got off the phone with Erin at your Williams Field location. I am not sure how you train your managers, but I would assume you do not train them to argue with your customers. We called in and ordered an extra large pizza, and they brought us a large. We refused the order and called to requests our proper order. When I called I spoke with a polite female who I explained my issue to, and she placed me on hold. After 5 mins Erin came to the phone and asked how he could help me. Frustrating to be passed on to someone else after I explained my issue. Erin then proceeded to explain to me that I ordered a large and asked me why I did not correct them when they read the order back to me. I was astonished, all I wanted was my extra large pizza, not for free, I wanted to pay for it. I just wanted the correct order. The conversation ended with him asking, \"what can I do for you?\", which I had already explained that I just wanted what I ordered. He then told me I could email Bruce Barro if I had an issue. We order pizza from Barros regularly, and we love your pizza. I have never had an issue, and your company always offers great service. I am shocked by how we were treated this evening, and it will be hard for me to order a pizza from Barros again."}
{"text":"I came in with a few friends yesterday and the store was a complete disaster. We probably stayed for two hours eating and talking and I never once saw one of the workers come out and pick up trash. Over half of the tables in the restaurant were dirty and the ground had food and trash everywhere. We were never once checked on and constantly had to walk to the counter to ask for more plates, napkins, silverware etc. The pizza was delicious but the wings not so much. We ordered boneless wings which were not hot and tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile. Considering how sick I felt the rest of the afternoon I am probably right. Overall the pizza was great, but totally not worth returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat pizza. The best Chicago pizza place. The wings and pizza is good.  the buffet is always stocked. This is the best overall."}
{"text":"I've always had pretty good luck with the Pizza and wings here. Never an issue with undercooked food or being shorted wings, flavor and quality have been consistently good. Why 4 stars? Prices are pretty high, so I rarely go. A couple dozen wings and a Pizza and you're somewhere between $35 and $40, a little extreme, but decent food, so what is your price point? Service has always been good too, nice employees. Give it a try, you'll like....."}
{"text":"Barro's is the best pizza joint around! Great food and good customer service!! You can't beat the lunch specials either."}
{"text":"This pizza is much tastier than I was expecting. My husband was craving a slice of pizza but we were at my Dad's house and didn't know of any New York pizza places in the area. He ordered a small pepperoni pizza, which was only $7. It was definitely not thin crust, but it tasted pretty good. I would definitely order from here again when I'm in the mood for pizza. The only negatives were the touch of heartburn I got after eating it, and my husband's stomach got a little upset but was fine after a run to the bathroom :("}
{"text":"So so, I visited this pizzeria on Super Bowl Sunday. They were quite busy as everyone had the same idea to order pizza and wings for pickup. The staff seemed to be doing a million things at once and we're getting confused about which order was mine. The wings were delightful however I thought the pozza was just average. I will have to try back again on another day when I have access to red pepper. I believe the red pepper would have made that pizza much better."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood pizzeria with great lunch specials. The cashiers need work. They are mostly teenagers with lackadaisical attitudes.   The restaurant cleanliness needs a little improvement too. I live right down the street on 45th Street and there has NEVER been a time that I didn't have to clean my own table and booth. Additionally, I've never been there at a busy time that would somewhat excuse the untidiness.   So, I recommend getting your pie to   Additional, they have a great lunch menu with very reasonable prices. I ALWAYS get the 2 slices, Sal's and a drink. I believe it's the number 8 combo lunch meal. You can go in there, during lunch, with literally change you find in couch cushions or wallet and find something within your budget.  Now, the wings, in my opinion, are overpriced. They also have a craft soda called Agave Vanilla (or something like that) and it was delicious.  Go for the pies, but don't have any expectations of receiving more than mediocre wait staff and cashiers. There is one cashier that I'm pretty sure has no teeth because she never smiles unless she's talking to her coworkers."}
{"text":"Gluten free bbq chicken pizza is awesome!  It's almost always perfect!  A time or so my crust was not crisp.  They have a nice terriyaki chicken gf pizza too.  My kids can get pepperoni regular pizza so everyone is happy"}
{"text":"We order delivery A LOT and we have NEVER been disappointed! The pizza is always perfect, crunch, perfect crust! The wings are always delicious, never have had a bad experience. Their delivery drivers are all so nice and polite! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Delivery on Halloween as we sat outside on a great night.  Had their meat lover version and it was fantastic.  Great pie.  It beats all the Desert ridge/north Scottsdale competitors!  All!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. We used to go to the Barros on Higley and Queen Creek but have since moved. We tried this location out last week and wow!! There was a slight increase in quality!! The wings here are freaking amazing! Well done guys!"}
{"text":"It's a little pricey but they definitely sell the most delishhhhh pies in town. We got the meat lovers! Their crust is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, not spectacular.  I do like that they have the buffalo wing pizza, which I think is great.    Basic salad bar with your traditional toppings, most if which can be found on one of their pizza offerings.  Sometimes the lettuce has seen better days so I pick around it.    They have ample space to accommodate a larger party which is nice.  The girls working the counter are always friendly and energetic.    I've mostly been here during lunch hours and I have to  say that they have the system down because this place can get really busy.  They have great luch specials which is what seems to draw the crowd.    The place always seems clean and they do a standard job when it comes to keeping the salad bar stocked and clean.  Sometimes there is a bottleneck to get drink re-fills because the fountain is next to the silverware, napkins and salad bar but this is a minor inconvinience.    I have had their italian sub which I wouldn't order again, it just wasn't that great.    I would recommend the pizza to a friend and return to eat again."}
{"text":"I FUCKING LOVE barros and the foods not very expensive either. My friends and family always want pizza hut but I tell them \" naw man lets get some FUCKING barros\" thank you for your time"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  The crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside - the way it should be.  The pepperoni was perfectly crispy on the edges and oily in the middle - the way it should be.    Cheap, clean, friendly, and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This location made 30 amazing pizzas for an event I hosted and everyone was thrilled. The breadsticks and salads were also delicious. They provided great service and a great product. Thank you everyone there!"}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch. Their specials are priced great and filling. Their salad bar is always fresh and delicious. Probably the best place in anthem to take you family for good food at a budget friendly price."}
{"text":"For a pizza joint, this place is very good. I've ordered a few times (pizza and sometimes wings) and am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Its pizza yo check out their lunch specials will you get a pizza slice and a drink for a couple bucks and your hot wings were the bomb you got a try them.  Also, they have a special at lunchtime for the ice cold beer in the pitcher I tried drinking by myself be careful. Twisted....."}
{"text":"Update on review: Ordered pizza & wings for delivery tonight. I was skeptical at first since my last  experience wasn't good. The manager did reach out to me by telephone and email apologizing for the bad food I got. I always appreciate when a business as big as barros actually take the time and reading/addressing the reviews.   Delivery took about an hour which was what they quoted me on the phone. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and honey hot wings. Everything was good. Wings were hot and tasted very fresh with a lot of meat. The honey hot flavor was very good as well. Sweet with a little kick. The pizza I wish had a little more sauce as there was almost done but it had tons of cheese and cooked perfect.  Overall I was glad I gave them a second chance and  food was hot and tasty. Good Saturday night cheat meal."}
{"text":"What great service! We came in on rather sad circumstances and were looking for pizza for a gathering following a service. We received totally awesome service! The manager was very helpful and got us set with a whole stack of pizzas in a pretty amazing amount of time.   We were able to place our order and grab a seat for a little while, drink a few beers and take the order over to the wake. It was very nice that we were able to receive the customer service we received because it made what was already a tough day much easier.   I was definitely surprise and satisfied with our experience and will consider Barro's Pizza for family dinner night as well as possible events moving forward."}
{"text":"I came during lunch so I could enjoy one of their lunch specials.  Multiple locations in north Phoenix have BBQ chicken pizza on Fridays however this location did not.  I thought this was a Barro's thing, I guess not. Bummer.  I ordered a #2 - two slices and a drink, both sausage.  They was tasty, but not as fresh as I typically have had during lunch.  It was 2:30 and lunch stops at 3, so I'll give them a pass.  Overall, a good lunch deal for slices of pizza."}
{"text":"I have only been to Barro's for lunch, but I have always had a good meal.  I usually get a sausage & slice of the day (BBQ chicken) and they are both terrific.  Two slices of pizza & a soda for about $5 is a great deal. And the BBQ chicken pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in the lack of Customer Service that I received today. Specifically because their Military discount is only applied to take out orders.    I asked to speak with a manager in case the person taking the order wasn't sure of the company policy.   However, this wasn't the case. I was again told no, a military discount could not be added to my order today because the driver delivering the food would have to make sure \"everything was correct\" & that was somehow impossible.   I'm even more confused because we've ordered take out pizza and dine in pizza and received the discount from this same location.   Plus, other pizza places offer a military discount on delivery with proof of a military ID.   There's only one way I can explain this type of business relationship. NOT. COOL.  Here's your one star review! Hope you enjoy your extra 10-15% for the last order I'll make from this company, instead of keeping a lifelong customer happy you'll save your company 2 bucks & some change."}
{"text":"I've been craving Barro's for awhile. Today, since I had a few errands to run in the Pavilions at lunchtime, I decided to drop in for some takeout. This review runs between a 2 and 3 star. 3 star for pizza, 2 star for service.  I went with a 2 slice combo lunch special (forgetting that they actually have giant slices). The salad was fresh, crisp and tasty. The lunch specials are a GREAT value. My pizza seems to have been sitting out for awhile (although the sausage is tasty), so I wasn't terribly impressed this time.   When I walked in, there were maybe 3 patrons. As I walked up to stand at the counter, 3 more people piled in behind me. I'm not sure if the sudden appearance of customers made the lady at the counter nervous and suddenly forget her manners/training, but she took my money, tossed my container of pizza and salad on the counter (along with my pizza sauce smudged to-go drink cup), put a plastic bag ON TOP of them and said \"NEXT CUSTOMER\".    No \"thank you\" nor \"have a nice day\" offered, no effort to put my to-go order in a bag, just an abrupt dismissal. Maybe next time I'll try to scrape up enough time to actually dine-in, if there is a next time, but I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza option in the valley. They have great lunch options and are great for dine in and carry out. Sign up online and get 25% off of your first order. Love the pizza here.  Customer service is not bad either. Great little place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob...I had stuft pizza while growing up and the original Round Table Pizza as well - you have to love the Bay Area.  I never found pizza that was comparable to Stuft Pizza in all the places that I lived - okay, aside from Vegas -- there was North Side Nathan's.  The crust here at Barro's is very close to Stuft Pizza and that is why hubby and I love it so much. It doesn't taste over processed and from a mix. It tastes like it's made there every day - a bonus!  Their wings are pretty tasty and a bit bigger than we expected, which is a good thing.  :)  We prefer having them deliver or going to pick up the pizza ourselves. It's clear that it's a very loud place...and I don't do loud places too well. ;) Well, that and I dislike little children running around me trying to beg for food off me.  Definitely a thumbs up from hubby and myself!  Now if they only had pesto pizza on the menu..."}
{"text":"Watch out if you order a white pizza as it is not your typical white pizza. The manager informed me that the counter worker should have informed me about there different style of white pizza and upon telling him I was not informed he did nothing to correct my issue."}
{"text":"My Lady & I were looking for a good place to grab some pizza. We stopped in to Barros & were amazed by the service. The building is very nice & atmosphere was great! Ordered the all meat pizza, switched out the bacon for chicken & let me tell you it was awesome, we ate till our hearts where content. Woke the next morning n ate cold pizza straight out the fridge, now that is when you know you got some good pizza! Keep up the good work Barros!"}
{"text":"This Barro's is great.  Pizza is always awesome and so are the wings."}
{"text":"Just took our family here for lunch. The food was great and it was ready quickly . The manager was very courteous and attentive. We couldn't be happier with our experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised last night with their delivery pizza. They told me it would be an hour, which I understood being a Friday at 6 PM. However it got here in less than 30 minutes, piping hot, and with the most fresh and delicious mozzarella cheese. Would recommend them and order again. The regular pizza is quite thick, so would mabey try it thin crust in the future"}
{"text":"still have not heard from anyone again what a shame they are letting their business go down the drain"}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza is a decent place to grab a pizza if you are looking for a last minute pizza fix. If you have the time to eat in, I would recommend it as the pizza always tends to be better. We ordered an extra large pepperoni pizza and by the time I got it home it wasn't really hot anymore. The only thing saving this review from lower star rating is their sweet red chili wings. They are some of my favorite wings to get. If it wasn't for them this place would definitely not be my first go to for pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped impromptu saw they sell slices until 4PM. Came in ordered two slice and a beer great service friendly staff. Pizza was good, and less than $10."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza for the first time. After working a busy shift I stopped by to pick up a large pizza. It was good with plenty of toppings. It's not to pricey either. A large pizza with a side of mozzarella sticks came out to about $21. Niiiice! I'll have to stop by again....their salads looked bomb! And maybe a pepperoni only pizza next time."}
{"text":"Service is good and Friday lunch special BBQ chicken pizza ...yum! Not a big fan of their Italian menu though."}
{"text":"Always fast, always good, and the Manager Cyle goes out of his way to ensure a great visit! He fixed a mistake we made when we ordered pizza from the wrong location; canceled my other order and made my order on the fly so I didn't have to wait longer than necessary, Thank you Cyle! You made my double on a Friday so much better!"}
{"text":"Food: Pizza is always delicious, piping hot and well cooked. I've been here twice (but at different locations) and both times we ordered XL pizzas. They're colossal! Had their version of a meat lovers pizza and their Barro's Special, which had bell peppers, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, olives, and onions. They never skimp on cheese or toppings and the dough has a nice base/taste. As far as alcoholic beverages they offer beer and wine.   Prices: Appropriate. Beer and wine are priced pretty well too. A big ole pitcher of beer is about $10.  Atmosphere: It's okay.  Service: Good and kind."}
{"text":"Just flew into Phoenix after traveling over 24 hours - drove straight to our amazing rental house in chandler - found this Fantastic pizza place that delivers here on Yelp! Sweet lady with a name that began w A answered / very cheerful, accommodating & polite. Our order arrived exactly when promised and delicious!!!!!!! Pizzas, salad & all utensils, plates etc - highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza for the price! Very cheese and the sauce is yummy too! Order at the counter then wait for the pizza to arrive, very gags and easy! Great place to eat before a movie at ultra star."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't written a review for Barro's Pizza yet when its been a fast lunch time favorite for years now.  Barros has great lunch specials that do not break the bank, I always go for the 2 slices and a small drink for 4 bucks, and with tax it's still under 5 bucks, and they don't skimp out on the size of the slices.  They have different daily specials, when I went it was the Hawaiian, so I ordered a slice of Hawaiian and a veggie. Both where delish! Great crust, good sauce, decent amount of toppings, all that makes for a great lunch time stop!  Service is friendly, food is great, glad to have them on my fast lunch time eats list!"}
{"text":"Whenever we have a really crazy work day at work, our boss heads on down to Barro's to get us some pizza! I have to say I like Barros! The crust is great and the pizza isn't too saucy and it's loaded with toppings, my fav by far is the Barro's Special! Barro's also has great lunch specials to 2 slices of pizza & a soda 4 bucks!  I hate really busy days at work, but love the pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST kids meals in South Chandler.  It's cheap, fresh, and yummy"}
{"text":"I was very reluctant to order a take-out pizza from Barro's... had gotten a pretty lousy pizza from another location in Phoenix recently. But I'm glad I took a chance on it... the pizza was absolutely delicious!  Ordered two medium thin-crust pizzas, the mega meat, and the Kona. The mega meat was out of this world! Lots of yummy topings (bacon bits were my favorites). And the Kona was sweet and glazed over with lots of teriyaki sauce. Satisfied my sweet tooth!  Both were baked just right... uniform, not gooey. And the crust was just the right thin-ness. I've had thin-crust pizzas from other places that were like crackers. Barro's crust was still soft. Nice!  Anyway, great place to take out pizza from. I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! PLEASE READ AFTER READING NAZARAS REVIEW.   I want to address the review from Nazara,  i was the \"friend\" and I was ordering food.. as you can see in the picture no one else was complaining and like she said it her post there was a huge line so...don't you think your food would take a little longer than normal??  Also,I personally work with autistic kids and shr cleary said right in front of me \" she is retarded\" and I don't think she knows the definition correctly to be able to use this word- the definition is \" less advanced and mental,physical, or social development than is usual for one age\" for a child to be, in her words \"retarded \" you must be diagnosed by a psychologist. I have know this person for years and let me tell you she is not any of what that definition says. So if she could get your facts straight before blurting a word like that out that would be better than her yelp review."}
{"text":"Darren the manager, extremely rude to employees.. I heard him yelling from the dining room of barros and he was located in the kitchen. I asked the counter girls how they liked working there and they relayed with \"the manager plays favorites and harasses us but there isn't much we can do about it because he is our general manager\".. Made me so sad to hear that employees are being treated this way.. the food is always good. However, I will not be going to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby had this a few weeks ago at a friend's house party and had to order it for ourselves which we did last night. We chose carryout due to delivery being an hour a day half wait! I ordered small pepperoni, bacon and Italian sausage, omgeeeeee freaking amazing. They are so much more affordable and better that NYPD pizza. The crust is great, the sauce, everything. Some of the best pizza we've had!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Barros and it never fails to hit the spot! The sauce and dough are just so tasty to me, it's simplistically classic and flavorful. Their customer service is wonderful all around. We even received candy canes from our delivery driver around Christmas as an added treat. Feels like family."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here once a week for month now. Fast delivery, good pizza for a great price. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place an order for pickup for pizza and wings. They did have the order ready as when they said they were. Got the pizza home and it still tasted very delicious. The toppings you can tell are fresh and at pretty good quality. The crust was done nicely and the cooked but still thin.  Wings were nice and crispy with mild sauce."}
{"text":"Their Pizza is very awesome. You walk in you go to the counter order your pizza and wings and find its clean table and sit down. Grab your drinks from the drink fountain. Then wait for your deliciousness to come out of the oven. We got pizza and wings and got to say they're fantastic very good."}
{"text":"Great place to stop on by if you are shopping nearby or are in the strip mall where it is located. The pizza was pretty decent, I have been here before and it is pretty much the same. The crust is traditional on the medium thick side, unless you order something else. I wish the hot wing sauce had a little more kick to it but it had good flavor. The wings themselves are pretty big and crispy. The service was friendly and it is an overall quiet, dark place to come hang out, eat pizza, and watch the game on the many tv's they have in this place."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza that microwaves well the next day. Try the Mega Meat pizza, you'll thank me later. Bacon, Pepperoni, ham, sausage, and meatball. The wings were okay, standard wing fare so it is acceptable, just don't expect wing explosion in your mouth."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!! We were new to the area and gave this place a try. We ordered pepperoni pizza, medium wings and cinnamon bread. All were great. We have become regulars. Their prices are wonderful as well. The place is super comfortable,clean and service always friendly."}
{"text":"Always delicious and the lunch combo specials are so convenient and affordable!!   Love love love Barros!!!"}
{"text":"We have visited Barro's 4 times in the last 6 weeks and find the pizza consistently great. Barro's is much better than any other option around Laveen. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. We are thrilled to have a quality option for pizza in our area....finally!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Refreshing to finally taste great pizza. It will be a regular when ever I come to PHX. I'm happy I didn't listen to some of the reviews.... They are so off! Really!!!! One of the comments was he was going to vomit. My pizza tonight was so fresh, hot and full of fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I loved be this pizza! Mmm, just the thought of it makes me hungry. Nice order taker, good driver, it was here in a reasonable time. I will be back once again!!"}
{"text":"I give this location one star. Not only was my salad old. But My fiance wings were not cooked. After a $40 bill the manager only gave us $18 back. Should of been free! Its called customer service especially if raw food (chicken) went out their door. Some people still do like and deserve good customer service.  we will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate dinner here on Sunday, September 11th. We ordered a large, one topping pizza, and 24 medium chicken wings that were advertised as one of their specials. In addition, we ordered a small salad and 5 fountain drinks. One of my daughter's ordered a small, gluten free pizza.  The restaurant wasn't that busy for a Sunday evening. There was a football game on the t.v. featuring the Arizona Cardinals. We sat down at a large booth in the corner and waited patiently for our food to be brought out. Our pizza's arrived first. I inquired about the chicken wings was told those would be coming by the young lady that brought out our pizza's. After more than enough time had passed, our wings still had not arrived. My husband went up to the front and inquired about our chicken wings. He was told they were sorry that somehow things were mixed up and they would get them right out.  Shortly one of the managers brought out $18 in cash and refunded some of the money I paid to eat. He apologized profusely and added our wings would be out soon. Not long after, our chicken wings arrived fresh and piping hot.  I really like this location of Barros. The management here is outstanding, the food is always really good, the ingredients are fresh and the restaurant is clean. The employees are friendly and welcoming. We will return to this location. They really take care of their customers here."}
{"text":"It was good......not WOW, but good.   Like the fact that you can make your own 'to go' salad.....that scored points with me. Hubby loved the sauce on the pizza.....we called ahead and still waited about 10 minutes.....on a Sunday night......but overall not too bad.    Staff was friendly and that went a long ways.  :)"}
{"text":"We requested the TV channel to be switched to watch the 24 hours of Le Mans race and after 13.6571 minutes of searching he found it for us. Thank you for not giving up on us, Steve."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places on this side of town. traditional barros special with extra cheese is the way to go!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here for a while and it's true, it's all about the service, especially after a mistake.  We ordered an xl thin crust and 6 wings.  The pizza wasn't thin, it was burned and the wings were lukewarm.    Called the store, spoke to Shawn the manager, he had a new pizza sent over to us and a dozen wing free within a half an hour and it was perfect.  Will continue to order from them."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Anthem by far! Actually the best pizza I have found in phoenix so far.  This particular Barros has way better pizza than some of the other Barros in the valley. ..not sure why but it is worth driving to this one if you want a great pizza.  The prices are awesome too.  Great value! Large 2 topping for under $10 it's a steal.  Way better than a $20 pizza at a major chain."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with the family, great pizza that's always fresh and piping hot. Wings are also awesome! The service is friendly and courteous. Prices are good and also have a salad bar. If I'm having pizza with the family, my first choice is Barros."}
{"text":"I'm going to give it a one-star and the caveat is that I didn't get to taste the pizza but was rudely talked to by the cashier.  If you walk into a pizza place that serves slices at 12:20 in the afternoon on any given day of a work week with co-workers, there should be pizza ready to serve. There was one pizza ready to serve it was ham and pineapple. Yeah everybody likes that one right?! So I asked, \"Excuse me, how long is it going to be before the other pizzas come out?\" She (brown hair in ponytail) says to me, \"Oh its going to be a while.\" And swishes off, without a beat.  Wow, lunch time during the week there should be pizza galore waiting, right?! If nothing else, the little idiot running around treating customers rudely, should find out a time frame.  Called and spoke with Chase (said he was the manager) told him, yeah...guess not too concerned.  If you are a looking for a wait for lunch and rude cashier, hit this Barro's up. Better yet, go down the road to Frankie's Famous on Baseline and Stapley (Cooper). Love they're vegetarian with green olives and garlic crust. Please don't forget the garlic knots at Frankie's either."}
{"text":"Wow what a place to eat!  Stopped by here while waiting for my haircut across the parking lot at Sports Clips and what an exuberant choice it was to swing by!    I walked just in time to get something from the lunch special and the deals here are unreal! 3 pieces of pizza and a small drink for $6... with no wait!!   Now, not only is this place great for a quick lunch stop, but their pizzas on the menu are spectacular. Great place to watch a sports game or bring a group of people!  The pizza itself was pretty decent but the deals definitely play a gargantuan roll in the quality of this eatery."}
{"text":"This Barro's moved to its current location from an old, dingy spot further south on Power Rd. The new location is a huge improvement. It's airy and spacious with lots of windows. There are just two design choices that baffle me. They put a long row of benches right in front of the cashiers. When you place a to go order, you get to sit down and stare at the butts of all incoming patrons. Awkward. The other odd choice is to make it so if you're sitting near the video games or the whole north side section, there is no shortcut to the restrooms and soda machines. You have to go back to the front of the restaurant. Other than that, the pizza and service are good, so I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Barro's has got to have my favorite pepperoni pizza, and I have been enjoying it from different locations since I was a kid. It has been a tradition for me to get pepperoni pizza, wing sauce and ranch dressing. This is the only place I do that- but I crave it every once in a while. This location has not disappointed me- and I still go here even since I moved past delivery distance. I have to be honest- I love the way the pepperoni has crispy edges, and I do not notice that at any other pizza place.  The slice of the day options are great and I like the spaghetti as well. I do mix it up on occasion."}
{"text":"I should take a picture of these wings. Disgusting. I got the ones without the sauce. They looked like little rawhide doggie chews. I'm not even exaggerating. The cheese was weird and the BBQ chicken pizza was horrible. What is worse is that I had too wait what seemed like a long time. It looked like it was all high school kids working there.   I like the Barro's on 7th St and T-Bird. Completely different. Way better. This one is nicer inside but the food is bad. I'm sure they can fix all this. It's just too nice a place.  Message me if you want to see those nasty wings."}
{"text":"The pizza's very good! Unusual in that you have to order and pay first but they different combo pizzas are good. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Pluses: Cheap lunch specials. Quick service.   Minuses: Pizza is ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Very good pizza fast delivery. But they don't have a lot of selection to put on the pizza. They never change specials or have coupons."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have found in Phoenix area so far.  Delicious sweet sauce and nice thick Chicago crust.  Wings are good, not great.  Staff is always helpful!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza. We order monthly and recommend their garlic sauce for dipping. Good prices and always friendly staff"}
{"text":"I used to love Barros when I lived in Phx, didn't realize they were still around until I saw one open near me. Thought Id give it a try.  Great lunch special - one slice with salad and drink! It was a cheese, and it was a bit dry and not very good.  Decided to try again today.  Wanted the Hawaiin. They said they were out presently and said it would be about 7 minutes. Ok fine I ate my salad and 10 minutes later asked about it, another five minutes. Ok got it, to find that the slice was a mess, cheese everywhere.  I ate it but honestly all I could taste was the tomato sauce and it wasn't very good.  Too bad, I had fond memories of that place.  There are plenty of other pizza places around there. I'll spend a bit more and get good food."}
{"text":"So it's starting to get pretty old. Always something with these people. A few times in the past our delivery has been cold and late. Today I come to pick up my order and they tell me they dropped my pizza and I have to wait for a new one to come out the oven. They need to get it together."}
{"text":"Barrows is so good. I feel its the best chain pizza joint in town. Lunch specials kick ass. Two huge slices and a drink $4 out the door. Great salad and sandwiches for $5 as well. The pizza sauce is so good. I did work here when I was a teenager so I know they make the dough and the sauce in house everyday. I hope Barros takes over all those other horrible pizza places ( dominos, papa johns, pizza hut). I still have know idea how those places are open. I dont know anyone who eat that crap. They have crap pizza and high prices, but not Barros. This place rocks. If you like cheese then get the extra large, it has over a pound of cheese, im more of a sauce person. Oh yeah they have wings to. UM UM"}
{"text":"As for delivery pizza, this is as good as it gets in AZ.  Forget all those big pizza chains.  You can't get the flavor from them like you can from Barro's.  I absolutely love the tomato sauce on their pizzas and the crust is doughy but not too soft nor too crispy.    As for their salads and their salad bar in the restaurant portion, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Iceberg lettuce?  Seriously?  At least throw me a bone and throw in some spinach or lettuce with a little color to it.  The toppings for the salad are not the best either.  If you stick to delivery with Barro's, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We love Barro's pizza for delivery or pickup.  I wouldn't reccommend a salad there because it's only made of iceberg lettuce which seems pointless to me, but the pizza is always wsaucy and always has a ton of toppings."}
{"text":"Still the same Barro's I loved in Mesa.  This one was big, and had a lot of tables.  It was very busy, which is not a surprise.  The only flaw I saw in the whole place is that the soda machine is past the cash registers.  So people paying/picking up and people going to refill drinks keep crossing paths.  A place that busy, it was kind of annoying.  Pizza was as good as I expected."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  LOVE this pizza!  Positives: We eat this pizza all the time and we always love it.  This pizza is loaded with cheese! They certainly do not skimp on cheese, sauce or toppings!  The crust is so yummy too! We get the boneless wings too which are pretty good (not amazing though but we still like them)  Negatives: I have no complaints"}
{"text":"We eat from this location regularly. Always on point. LOVE this place! Great pizza. Great wings. Great service. We get the fire wings. Perfect spiciness."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, been coming here for years. I went to the 7th street location up until now. Can't lose on the lunch special."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! The staff is friendly and fun and the pizza is amazing! Tried their ravioli a couple of times and holy wow!! Lunch specials are affordable priced and always hot and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza for the win. I'm a fan of this places Pizza for sure and would happily come back. Their regular Pizza is good too and I have great appreciation for their fresh toppings."}
{"text":"Best pizza EVER. I'm from Detroit and was looking for some good pizza. I promise you, you will not be dissatisfied disappointed or upset. The staff is nice very friendly, nice and clean inside. I wish they had deep dish pizza . However, I'm very satisfied with the pizza."}
{"text":"Now this is a pizza place!!! Very good and very well priced. Wings aren't \"the best\" out there, but they are the best wings I have tried at a pizza joint. Very good spot or pizza"}
{"text":"Sadly I've lived in Chandler for almost 10 years and had yet to give Barro's a try. Ended up grabbing some dinner for my family yesterday. We ordered the 6 honey bbq wings, medium pizza (ham and pineapple), and the garlic bread. The pizza was delicious and cooked really well. There was a good amount of toppings (unlike other places where they skimp on the toppings), and the crust we all loved (especially my son who just kept asking for the crust haha). The wings sauce was good and the fry was also good however we did have a piece that seemed like it was over fried (almost too crispy and a bit dry) but 5/6 is still good in my book. Lastly, the garlic bread was probably the lowlight of the meal. The garlic sauce was good, but the bread itself seemed like it was old and dry.  Overall, I'll give Barro's a try again but will try and pray the garlic bread is fresh :)."}
{"text":"The service here is incredible! Alisa, was top notch and needs to be noticed for her amazing customer service!!! GREAT pizz, wings, and salad bar!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Barro's is really good. Quick pick up and hit and ready to go. We loved it."}
{"text":"Rude staff! Great pizza. Just had an even more annoying staff member run in than usual! We are very regular customers we typically get pizza once a week but typically delivered. When we go in to pick up we never seem to have the best customer service, this time was no different except much worse! The little blonde teen was very hesitant when I asked if they could double cut my pizza. She said \"well it might already be done\". Honestly I'm not sure what that has to do with double cutting. I would hope the pizza is done when it's being cut! She brings pizza out and says \"ya it was already done\" I asked why that was a problem to double cut it and she said \"well, we are kinda busy!\" I was a little shocked but just said fine just leave it there (had to take my daughter to restroom). I come back out and she's telling another teen girl about the annoying customer she just had (me!) wow! I guess Danny (manager) was working tonight. But considering the typical teenage staff who never seem to get any customer service training, I figured why bother! I do love the pizza so I can't give it 1 star..but man I need to stick to delivery. The drivers seem to be the only employees who are kind and considerate!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and the pizza and wings are always on point,the lunch deals are the best and no wait..!!"}
{"text":"We get Barro's about once a month in Queen Creek but today my office placed an order and picked it up from this Mesa location. The pizza and wings were good, my only complaint is that the wings needed more sauce on them. We tried a couple new kinds: meat lovers and some chicken pineapple one. Everyone said they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Exceptional pizza!   This little place was jam packed on a Saturday night for carry out.  It took an hour for the pizza to be ready but SO worth it.    The group got the sweet chili Asian boneless wings, garlic bread with cheese and an extra large pepperoni pizza.  What can I say...the wings were spicy and hit the spot, the bread was perfectly salty and crispy, and the pizza was so gooey and crust was perfect to dip in a side of marinara.    The sauce was balanced nicely with a hint of sweet and acidic and the cheese had a great melting factor.    This place did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Not to be a jerk but when you order food to go you do NOT expect it to sit on the counter getting cold. Seriously there are 3 to go orders sitting on the counter getti g cold. Shame on management for allowing this and not following health dept regulations. Prepared food is to be kept under warmers. We wont be ordering over the phone again for sure. *update*  Manager really needs to put a gag on the mouthy broad at the counter. Because I brought this to the managers attention she had the audacity to call my son a prick. How ugly and disrespectful this staff is."}
{"text":"It's extremely unfortunate that I'm giving Barro's pizza one star. I LOVE the pizza here. In the past year, I moved to this area and this is the closest location to me. I have tried multiple times at this particular store. The manager is rude and will talk over me when I'm explaining my side of what happened. It's a hit or miss with team members, some are very friendly and others are very short and rude with their words. I order my pizza with PLAIN olive oil in lieu of pizza sauce and every single time I get the white pizza sauce. This has seasoning and garlic in it, nothing against that but I do not order something plain and expect multiple flavors. Same problem on multiple occasions has officially steered me away from this store. I will drive the couple extra miles to go to a friendly Barro's that can get an order right."}
{"text":"We get the pizza and wing deal a couple times a months.  It is always our go to for delivery. But we do always have to request extra sauce on the wings so they come covered properly.  It is our favorite pizza and wings, we have been customers for over 4 years."}
{"text":"Barros is #1 always!! So pumped that it's near my house finally!! An Arizona staple of great pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been a Barro's consumer since 1990 in high school and have visited and become loyal to many locations throughout the valley since then.  I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this location, its management and staff.  I have ordered from here 4-5 times since they have opened.  Every time I request verbally over the phone for parmesan cheese and red peppers and guess what never arrives or I have to ask for again at in store pickup, yep cheese and peppers.  I understand that this is a small complaint as the food is always good but it is the small stuff that even when confronted to a manager they shrug off and say we will add to your account and blame the staff, this is not acceptable.  Again I can raddle off about 7 locations off the top of my head I eat or have eaten at for years and this is the only location that I can guarantee 100% before we order and request verbally we will never receive. There comes a point that where I either go back to make sure I go to a location I can get on the way home or drive back to or cut my ties in general.  I prefer none of the above and hope this location reads this, learns from it, and moves forward to make sure this does not continue to happen."}
{"text":"Just ordered a side salad to go and came home to eat it and found an extremely brown piece of lettuce (see my photo). 90% of the lettuce is browned/ looks like it has been sitting for weeks. I thought Barros typically had good health/freshness standards but I guess not..."}
{"text":"I recently had a customer service issue at this Barros location.  However, Amy Barro reached out to me promptly to address the concern.  She was very reasonable and showed great customer appreciation.  I have been a customer of Barros for 10 years and with leadership and customer service like Amy provided I'll be a customer for life.  I always say it's easy to look good when nothing goes wrong but you see who stands out when something does go wrong and I received an all star reaction.   This is my favorite pizza place in all of Phoenix and was mostly due to awesome pizza but now I'm more invested because of the passion the Barros put into their pizza and costumers.  Thank you Amy for being resistive and awesome!  Carlos"}
{"text":"Perty good pizza. My boyfriend's family says it's their favorite pizza in the area - easy to see why!"}
{"text":"Service always great neighborhood kids... pizza always great... salad bar is clean ... they have diet dr.pepper most places don't carry this... the boot he's have been great for me since I was in Jr high and high school for after games and or events... the lunch specials have worked for me for years.... I love this place... I come visit Arizona for a visit and come here for my #4... forever #barrows"}
{"text":"Barros always has amazing customer service. Not to mention they have great pizza I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Alright, alright, if you are a true Cave Creekerrr than you know that this is everyone's go to--  First off, the pizza specials are such a great deal, and if they have the Kona on special GET IT!  Also, you can't have the pizza without their signature ranch I swear you can't find a more perfect ranch anywhere else (sounds weird but I'm completely serious). If your not in the mood for pizza don't worry get the wings! I usually get the BBQ medium boneless wings. Such a great casual sit down, family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we continue to order from them.  I clearly state I'd like my wings extra crispy and extra sloppy, yet they are always dry and slimy."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza!  And although I do enjoy the toppings (such as hot wing, kona, Barros special & mega meat), I would say it is greatly because of the delicious crust :D I've read others reviews where they say there's nothing special about it, but I would beg to differ. It is crusty on the outside, soft on the inside & it doesn't give me an upset tummy after eating it, lol. They also have gluten free crust for those who prefer it.   This is also the only pizza place I know that sells it's pizza dough! You have to call ahead of time so they'll have it packed for you, but isn't that cool?    For lunch they sell pizza by the slice & have different pizza's available on different days of the week.   The only thing I don't like is that they have such a great relationship with all the local schools (which is good) that during the school year they sometimes reserve the entire restaurant (which is bad), leaving no seating room for any walk in guests. That doesn't quite seem fair. I love kids, but I love to eat my pizza sitting down too, lol! I'm terrible that way ;)"}
{"text":"Parking is plentiful with easy access from Riggs or McQueen avenues.  The establishment was very clean and inviting with plenty of booths or tables for seating.  Service was excellent with employees quickly taking your orders and being responsive and polite.  Our order was filled and on our table in a very short period of time.  We ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and it was very good.  In addition, we also ordered a pizza for later on.  By the way, their pizza is fantastic!  We would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"3 times is a charm this place has gone downhill if you plan to eat there make sure you opt to sit down and not do take out, Cold wings, limp pizza. Every time we have an issue they will apologize but it would appear they do not train the staff to do anything different. If you want to experience great Barros Pizza try the one off Peoria and 75th Ave.  (Update) 3/28   Lol make that 4xs WTH  1 star And they were not that busy....."}
{"text":"This is an old stand by. If you're achin' for thick cheesy dependability this is it.  We tend to go for a half Megameats half Pepperoni. I always ask for the ingredients on top of the cheese (it's my thing, to me there's a significant difference in the taste of ingredients baked on top vs boiled underneath the cheese).  Their wings are also quite good. It's a rough thing to deliver extra crispy hot wings... but they do arrive crispy from time to time, and I find that amazing.  I have always had excellent service dining in or delivery.   They do a good job at this location. Give 'em a go."}
{"text":"We've been to this Barro's countless times as it is in the neighborhood. Only once did I have a pizza that didn't come out perfect, it was just undercooked once, but other than that excellent pizzas. A little on the pricy side compared to what else is out there but love their toppings and flavor. I'd recommend the thin crust."}
{"text":"Best wings around.  Always crispy and cooked perfect.  I always have fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been here in AZ for about 6 months and Barro's is the best, most consistent pizza I've had. The staff is friendly and the pizza is delicious. 5 stars because I can't think of anything bad about this place.  The sauce is perfect and exactly what pizza sauce should be (none of that stuff that tastes like tomato paste here!). The crust is delicious all on its own and it always crusty but still moist and fresh. The cheese is obviously of good quality as well as are their veggies and meats they use for toppings. All this combines to make a great pizza. It is a little pricier than some other pizza places, buts it is also a lot better than cheap pizza, so it's worth it to spend a few extra bucks. Your wallet might not thank you, but your taste buds will."}
{"text":"been coming here quite a bit for lunch, its close to work and in shopping center. the place smells a little weird when you first walk in but i always take my pizza slices to go. two slices is pretty filling and if its just out of the oven its even better. always get a side of ranch on the side. Staff is friendly and its quick when ordering just a few slices for lunch."}
{"text":"My parents worked at the original Barros in California and it vanished when I was a baby. I was stoked to find out that it was because the moved to Arizona! The pizza is awesome and I really like eating there as opposed to delivery. However, the pizza by the slice isn't anywhere as fresh as the whole pizzas!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim to order a pizza and dine at Barro's and I stick by my original review.  Still great service, super friendly staff and prices are still very reasonable."}
{"text":"Just had weird experience in  Barros cashier unable to make change twice from a $1.00. Gave exact change she gave change back along with $.02. Are the schools  failing that much or is the next generation  to reliant  on computers to do simple math. The worst part of the experience is that I asked her when my 1st daughter's order was rung up. I'm trying to teach children about money by  paying for their lunch and the cashier can't even  count.  She was irritated by my inquiry  and the whole experience was bad. Won't be patronizing this establishment again in the future."}
{"text":"Order their special(1L pizza +24wings) like I usually do-- got 24 boneless wings instead of traditional. Really disappointed since it's 30+ dollars."}
{"text":"I have been going to Barro's since I was 10 years old. So 34 years.   It is hands down my favorite place to get pizza.  Well I will no longer being going to Barro's unless it is to any other one than this location.  My last delivery they were late getting to us. The pizza cold.  The crust just isn't the same anymore.  Is it that you are getting to big that the quality has to suffer? The quality has suffered from this location more than just this last time. Just isn't the same I'm sad to say."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Barro's since I was a kid...better than most national chains, great place specials for lunch, delicious wings, a pretty decent gluten free pizza for a decent price. Service is always friendly; Been a fan for 20 plus years and plan to be a fan for 20 plus more."}
{"text":"Quality time with my kiddo. Delicious pizza as usual. Ambiance is sporty. The pizza? Delicious. I do wish there was one closer, however a I suppose it's a good thing there isn't one"}
{"text":"Yum! Their hawaiianesque pizza was delicious (it had pineapple, chicken, hot wing sauce and teriyaki). We also got a pepperoni pizza with pineapple (can you tell we like pineapple?). We got breadsticks and garlic bread, which were kind of similar (but the garlic bread looked like it had fresher cheese). Very good. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Popped in for pasta last night. The pizza is always good but I wanted to try something else. The penne with meatballs was huge and very reasonably priced. The cheesy garlic bread at 1.49 was also a deal! Fast service, huge portions and good prices. Nice neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Rotten celery served with hot wings, dirty plates, freezer burnt pasta, bread hard as a rock. Thought this was a popular family place? Yuck! Never again!"}
{"text":"Order out or dine in Barro's at least 3xs a month. At my home place close to Lake Pleasant or across the valley when traveling and doing business. I've always been satisfied with their great customer service and high quality food. My favorite is there honey hot wings and personal size pizza with everything on it."}
{"text":"we got a \"welcome to the neighborhood\" coupon in the mail for a free large pizza and just had lunch there. EXCELLENT thin crust pizza!  best flavor we've found in a long time.   service was quick and cheerful and salad bar was good ! we'll be back thanks! Richard and Janet"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a pizza snob.  Having worked @ one for several years.  I know what I like. Having been here for a dozen years I missed Barro's back home.   We like Barro's.  We like them a lot.  We were so excited when we saw they were opening a store closer to us.  They have yet to let us down.  To quote the hubs \"it just a quality pizza\"  It is.  We've taken out and we've eaten inside.  It's always super clean and very relaxed.  Multiple televisions and the back area is super nice.  A little more quiet but not much.    Staff is the best @ multi-tasking.  It can get super busy.  Always willing to work with us.  Can we have half of this and on the other half this?  Can we have extra sauce?  No eye rolling or exasperation here.    We recently started ordering their garlic cheese bread sticks.  Off the chain.  In our house they are G A S.  Good as shit.  We love them.  They are great the next day.    We will continue to be patrons Barro's.  Don't ever change!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. We had ravioli w/ meatballs and I'd definitely order again. For appetizers we had wings that passed my girl's infamous tough standards. Salads were \"so-so\", although my girl gave them a failing grade. I give this place low scores for atmosphere, very young crowd and having to go back up to the line to order more beer. Enjoy."}
{"text":"this location is kinda dumpy and seems dirty. it really isn't dirty per-se, just outdated, run down, and therefore gives a dirty vibe. the pizza is always good, but generally the lunch pizza could be warmer. wings are good too. salad bar is low quality. the 3 stars i awarded are really for the pizza, because if you only order that you'll probably be satisfied. and $4 even for 2 slices and a drink (including tax!) should i really have a right to complain about the outdated facility? probably not."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever customer service is very friendly I would highly recommend coming here and try the wings mmmm"}
{"text":"Ben and staff are very curious pizza is great love the crust. The salad bar is a good choice too.  Giving back to the community is a BIG PLUS too.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim after a baseball game. When we got there, the restaurant wasn't too busy, but a decent amount of people were there. The lady that place our order wasn't the friendliest and a little cold.  While we weren't fans of the customer service, the pizza made up for it because it was delicious! I felt that the pizza deserved the 4 stars. The mozzarella sticks were also a home run!  Highly recommend for some delicious 'za!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza (original crust) and an order of breadsticks.  The pizza was delicious, and was just as delicious as leftovers the next morning. Even the crust stood up to nuking without getting all chewy and tough.  The breadsticks, however, left a lot to be desired.  They tasted like chewy, burnt garlic salt.  All in all, it was a pleasant experience, and the price was reasonable.  We will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Would be nice if a pizza place actually had cheese pizza.  I purchased the last cheese slice and they did not have any more in the oven.  They had everything other kind except plain cheese pizza.   Nice."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with this location (Lake Pleasant is better all the way around). First time at this one and probably won't be back.  The girl at the counter was friendly enough. I put in an order for a medium pizza and boneless wings, the wings came out pretty quickly but weren't all that tasty. While I was eating a few of the wings I heard the kitchen bell ring but didn't pay much attention figuring it was someone else's order as there was one other family in the dining room.  I noticed there were no staff going to the pickup window and there was a pizza sitting there.  Mind you, there were at least four staff members working that I could see. After about 10 minutes, the pizza was still sitting in the window. I decided to go up to the window and ask if it was mine but, I didn't see anyone there to ask. Looking at the pizza, I knew it was mine because it was a 1/2 & 1/2 pizza so I grabbed it myself. Needless to say, it wasn't piping hot. :(  None of the staff even seemed to notice that I had to pick my own dinner up from the kitchen window.  Also, there was almost NO sauce on our pizza, big disappointment.  Glad I only put a quarter in the tip jar."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place.  Consistent quality.  Great price.  Quick service dine in or take out!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Wednesday night pizza fix place. The staff is amazing and the food is great! We love going here for pizza and a beer. Bailey and Hannah are our favorite girls because they are always smiling and take great care of us! Thank you Barros for putting a location back in the Tempe/Chandler neighborhood. Mike the manager is incredibly helpful, too."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The flavor of the sauce, the texture of the crust and the quality of the toppings are all great. The wings are also tender and tasty - fire sauce really is hot too. I've tried a bunch of pizza places in this area, and Barro's is the best. They even have delivery!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! We ordered this last week I forgot to post review but.... wow I ordered slices from here before but this time we found out they deliver!!!!!! The fresh made pizza brought to our door was top notch! I only hope they continue this experience in future deliveries. Even our delivery person was kind. I am a New Yorker so pizza is my thing I am a tough critic and I can say I  am a fan here truly great and they do accept military discount NICE JOB !"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!!!  they have great priced lunch specials for work lunch or just a quick on the go lunch. The slices are very big. One of my favorites is the bbq chicken, BOMB!!!  The salad bar has a pretty decent selection. And the girls that work there are very friendly!"}
{"text":"Oooh!  A shiny new pizza spot!  I have been told time and time again to try Barro's, so the opening of this location was the perfect opportunity to put it to my pepperoni and mushroom test.  All I can say is What Took Me So Long!?  This pizza is GOOD!  Zesty sauce, ample topping coverage and a puffy pillow-like outer crust.  It looks like it would be chewy, but it is not.  How do they do that?  Some sort of pizza alchemy, I am sure.  This location is brand new.  The dark wood floors and high-backed booths (that don't yet have butt-indentations from previous guests) are not the typical plastic red/green/white decor what you would expect from a casual pizza restaurant.  The staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person, which is nice.    In addition to fantastic whole pies, they also have inexpensive lunch specials (2 slices and a soda for $4 is my favorite!) until 4pm every day.  My only small sadness is that this location does not deliver to my house (even though it is closer than the Barro's that does cover my delivery area).  Oh well, I like this one and will probably visit more than is good for me!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want a slice (or two!) of pizza.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing wood-fired or artisan.  No three hour wait.  No ingredients I can't pronounce.  Just pizza.  Pizza with puffy crust, red sauce and gooey cheese.  That's it.  That said, I was looking forward to the opening of this Barro's location, as it is within lunchtime range of my office.  Thanks to Alexander C's review, I knew that the 'Coming Soon' sign finally changed to 'Now Open'.  Yay!    To be sure this new location was just as good as the other Barro's that I have grown to love, I had to try out a couple of pepperoni slices.  After all, quality control is important, right?  I am happy to say the 'za was warm, soft and cheesy - just what I wanted."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and cheese bread last night and it was subpar. I called my order ahead of time and when I arrived, they lost my ticket and had to wait for the food to be made. When I got home, the pizza was extremely greasy and some of the cheese bread didn't even have melted cheese on it. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a review on the food but I'm still waiting to get my order and it's been an hour. Several employees have told me \"it'll be out in 1 min\" and that was so long ago. Disappointed and starving."}
{"text":"I ordered by phone for pickup. I was greeted properly and the young lady was patient since I didn't know what I wanted. I ordered a daily special of 1 XL 1 topping pizza and 24 wings. When we arrived for pickup, they were very busy (Sunday evening) our food was just like we ordered. The wings were a good size with a flavorful medium buffalo sauce. The pepperoni pizza was good, the crust was thick, but soft. Overall a good pizza. My only dislike was that they put my celery sticks in the bag with the ranch. I expected it to be in with the wings. But I still ate them  it's good food for a decent price. Only afterwards did I notice how greasy the pizza box was"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I come here all the times. The lunch specials are amazing! It's 6 dollars 6 wings a slice of pics and a drink! Very nice place and always clean. When I come here I bring friends and they always love it! Definitely my favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"Unless you want kids screaming in your ears and like watch parents who are too busy getting loaded and not giving a shit about how unruly their brats are being, then don't wast your time trying to have some decent pizza at a place the manager let's the animals run wild! I will NEVER dine in again at this place!!! I wish I could give negative stars!!!"}
{"text":"This location used to be the Amazing Grace bookstore, in the Home Depot plaza corner of Kyrene and Rural. It's much bigger than their former location at Warner and Rural, I believe it was. And lighting is much better.  And the kids' section is much better.  Haven't had Barros? The pizzas have generous chunks and slices of toppings, rather than eeny weeny looks-like-you-used-a-Chopper-machine- sized toppings.  If you are getting your order to go at this location, they do a great job. However, we are here on  a Monday night eating in, hardly anyone here,  we finished quite a while ago (15 or 20 min) and none of the workers has come by to see if we need boxes (or anything). I asked for extra napkins when she brought the pizza,  as we ordered wings (honey bbq are really good), and she only gave us like 5 more for a family of 4. It makes me sorry that I pre-tipped when I paid on the card, as I had no cash on me for a tip afterwards.  This service deserves no tip. :/  Sadly, the location at Alma School and Germann has the same bad service. We thought we would try this Warner location for dine-in since they do a good job for carry-out. Guess not.   If you choose to eat here, just know that the service will be bad and so if you happen to get good service,  you will be pleasantly surprised, rather than having your high hopes dashed like we did."}
{"text":"Food is edible but mediocre. Got the wings, which had little meat on them, we're not crispy at all, and were smothered in a weirdly gelatinous sauce (honey hot). The pizza was alright, nothing special but not bad. The breadsticks with cheese were also okay.   We ordered delivery, which was to come \"within an hour\", but didn't arrive for nearly an hour and a half. When I called to get the status, there was no apology for delay, just \"he's on his way so...\" When delivery did arrive, again, no apology for being late. Service could definitely be improved."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the west valley so far!! I have had their pizza 3 times and it is always delicious.  I have only had delivery & pick-up."}
{"text":"Used to like Barro's but this location has turned me off.  The pizza is just okay, service has been consistently bad, and good luck finding a napkin or condiment."}
{"text":"Had for my first visit to Barro's at least at this location - maybe any (?). Had  the \"white pizza\", and it was very  good.  Good crust - not burnt, good texture.  Mozzarella, and parmesan, and lovely lumps of ricotta on every slice, basted with Olive oil, had a light garlic flavor and thin slices of tomato imparting just a nice hint of tomato flavor to the marinara-less white pizza. Not overly salty either.  Only crossed the $10 barrier by virtue of adding a side of garlic bread. Was well-filled and had 1/2 generous sized \"small\" pizza to take home.  Hit them after 9pm on Friday night. You could tell the place had been jammed and though had quietened down, a steady stream of customers continued through the doors for both dine in and take out.  Very informal - polished concrete floors.  Noted none of the foul smells others noted below.  Basically slightly spartan with the polished concrete floors and came across as clean, but  as the rush appeared to have been over for a while, I'm not sure there is excuse for the crumpled paper napkins left on the floor here and there throughout the dining area.   It's basic, a walk-up ordering counter, slightly low padded booths, bare tables, but staff was friendly, food served reasonably promptly, and it was really good.  Is there better pizza in the valley? Sure, but this was very good, quick, convenient, and $10 for a meal fit for two - if you want ambiance you can go pay for that elsewhere. Barro's is a just a good, maybe in its context, even \"great\" neighborhood pizza parlor  (with pasta & subs too).  Granted I'm waxing effusive for a 1-meal based review, but it was more than satisfying and I'll go back for more,"}
{"text":"Yummy who doesn't love pizza?!? This local was perfect right by my husbands work that night. We both wanted something fast and amazing We ordered the meat lovers which was amazing and taste!!! I love a good pizza pie! I would totally love to try other types of pizza and other things on the menu at some point But it was pretty tasty"}
{"text":"The pizza is consistently good but the service is extremely slow! Could also do without the fly service TOO!! I get that every once in awhile a fly may slip into your restaurant, but we've been there 4 times now and with each visit, fly service. So order out from now should you choose to eat here."}
{"text":"So so so amazing. Staff was extremely friendly. Clean restaurant and it was the best pizza I have ever tasted. I HIGHLY recommend the cheesy bread as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The only pizza place I order from. The pizza is well prepared, soft crust and fresh toppings! Tried venturing out and order sandwiches but was not as impressed as I was with the pizza. The pizza never disappoints. Delivery time is always reasonable and the staff is friendly. Recently started ordering the cheese breadsticks an those are great sides to have with the pizza! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Cheap lunch for sure, but a very fatty, greasy pizza. The place was also not very inviting and seemed a bit dirty. An obvious hangout for high schools kids so plan on dealing with loud and obnoxious noisemakers."}
{"text":"The pizza really tasted pretty good, especially the thin crust. But the wings... yucko. I had a pizza and some wings delivered tonight, but should have skipped the wings. At least half of them were so dry I think maybe they were cooked yesterday and warmed up just for me. They were completely dry all the way through. I like a little crunch, but come on, not the meat! They were quite disgusting. I threw most of them into the garbage.   But here's the thing. While I actually liked their pizza, I may not go back simply because if they care so little about their product's quality, the pizza may be bad next time, or worse, may not contain fresh ingredients, or contain who knows what. Sorry Barro's, you blew it tonight."}
{"text":"We have to eat gluten free due to allergies and this was really good pizza.  It is prepared in the walk-in where there are no gluten containing ingredients.  I would give them 5 stars but it took 35 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon for them to make it.  If you don't need to be GF, then there is quick pizza by the slice that the other people in our party really enjoyed"}
{"text":"Pizza place on a Friday night, not that busy, but it is Valentines Day. So tonight we tried a different Barro's, well because quite frankly We were tired of the bad service at Power and Queen Creek. Seems like the Val vista and Williamsfield location lies in the same bed when it comes to customer service.  Ill Hand it to this location, the food was better then out last experience at QC & P, but geez people, slap a smile on your face, earn some tips, have fun at your job! So out to San Tan we go, where while I've been there once, we were treated amazingly and the food was great."}
{"text":"This is wack. Smh ? I can't believe I ate this bro. There pizza is good but I don't recommend there wings  who gonna eat wings that aren't cooked all the way?? No one. My names albert and I approve this message!!"}
{"text":"Barro's pizza uses top quality ingredients and the pizza is always cooked to perfection. I would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Came in last night thinking they closed at 9, but the cashier let me know that they closed in 10 and we had plenty of time. I ordered a mini pizza and my friend ordered an Italian sub. Our food came out in a timely manner. The girl who brought us the food was very friendly and asked if we needed anything else, but we had everything we needed. The drinks are refillable which is great. The passion fruit tea was so delicious, I refilled my drink to go. The food was great. My friend and I were very happy. Great customer service, great food. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Barro's Pepperoni Pizza is the saltiest pizza I have ever tasted!  The Hot Wing Pizza was very dry.  There were only a few little flecks of chicken here and there.  Not really enough to even taste like chicken.  There are so many pizza places around here, I will probably try those out first before ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The pizza is good... Thick crust, lots of flavor...  Avoid the wings & salad... Pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"Ordered a Barro's special!! Had the put salami instead of pepperoni, MUST HAVE BEEN 4 pieces of salami cut in half on that whole pizza!!!! WHAT A RIP OFF, Never go there again!! Too many orther pizza places to go to not get ripped off in the ingredients!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I wasn't really even in the mood for pizza but my date was and he suggested Barro's. I'm so glad I went!!  The food is unbelievable. I ordered a medium Kona Pizza (Teriyaki sauce, chicken, pineapple). With 8 slices, it was more then enough for me alone and I was happy I got to take some home. YUM.   The atmosphere is a typical pizza joint: clean, friendly, and welcoming. Wait time is average but worth it for these pizzas!  Prices are a little higher then you'd spend at Pizza Hut but only by about $10. Indulge! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pizza here at Barros is very tasty, and the wings are crisp and saucy, i got the wings medium this time, but the hot ones are very good too...we usually get the salad bar as well.. We haven't really tried any of their pastas or other items, but, we have eaten at many of the Barros locations over the past 20 years. And they've always been good."}
{"text":"decent spagehetti decent pizza  wrong address"}
{"text":"I have always loved barrows, and sadly I will probably keep coming, but until they don't change where they get their cheese, people are going to keep getting sick. Idk what it is about the cheese but my family and I always get sick from it, too heavy maybe."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for pizza and wings. Occasionally it can be a little too greasy which is why I have it 4 stars, but still better than Pizza Hut or dominos!"}
{"text":"i've eaten at barro's locations in the east valley.  it's nice to have one in our neighborhood.  we ordered a pepperoni and ham & pineapple large pizzas.  they tasted so good.  they blew, LC, PH, and NNY pizza out of the water.  we loved it!  the wings had a lot of meat and sauce on them.  the cheesy bread sticks were great too.  we walked into the restaurant to have our orders to-go and there were 4 registers taking orders!  i thought that was cool.  we had our orders done in 20 minutes max and we were out the door.  BARRO'S MY STOMACH THANKS YOU!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot wing pizza, and cheesy bread sticks (yes I feel fat). The hot wing usually comes with ranch, but it doesn't anymore I suppose. I had to pay extra for ranch.   Yes this sounds like a rant, but hear me out.   It was pickup. Went and picked it up. Should've checked inside the box, but no ranch as I find out. And we're already home. The games starting. Eh. The thing that bothered me, is that they weren't even busy! Restaurant was about 20% full. They had no realistic excuse.  The other on going issue, is that the pizza is never cut! The managers usually cut the pizzas, and for some odd reason, it's me always tearing apart pizzas lol. The slices are no where near even. One could be 2.5 slices wide, and the other could be a quarter size slice.   Pictures don't do it's justice.   Called and spoke to a girl, which led to speaking to another girl...explaining the issue again, and the 2nd one chuckled before she yet again put us on hold to speak with a manager.   After meeting and knowing about 5 members of the Barros family...I'd expect them to eventually raise their standards of their staffing."}
{"text":"Just found a new position off of Germann and Dobson, so I'm always on the lookout for a good lunch deal. This place probably beats any other place within miles (until another Barros pops up). Best lunch deal around hands down. 2 slices and a drink is literally under $5.  When you're a cheap guy like me, this is the way to go. The price doesn't say much about the quality though. The pizza always tastes great. I order delivery sometimes, and always request Mike. He is hilarious. The staff in general are always friendly. I am happily moving to this area soon, and will be visiting this location many more times.   I also want to take a moment to brag that I am the Duke for this Barros on Yelp:)"}
{"text":"Went to Barros for the first time in a long time. We were very pleased. Got both a regular and a gluten free pizza as well as wings. Other then the employee at the register seeming new the service was good as well as the food."}
{"text":"Great pizza, smiling faces at the counter and fresh ingredients!  I have only dined from delivery or take out, however the excellent customer service was very evident.  Thanks Barro's!"}
{"text":"This is got to be the worst pizza around!  The people who liked this place do not know pizza.  I am Italian and this pizza is no where close to being the true traditional pizza!  Even my 12 year old know this place sucks because they served their day old pizza at his school."}
{"text":"I live in LA and have family in Mesa, but every time we are in town Barros Pizza is a must! I've been to a few Barros but this weekend was my second time going to the one on Power. It's small and quiet, but can't complain about the pizza. Pizza and wings are always warm, crispy and amazing. Authentic Chicago style pizza, I recommend Barros to all pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"This was delicious pizza! My family devoured it.   I can't decide if I like the crust or the sauce more.  Their crust is a perfect thickness.  Not so thick it's greasy but not so thin it feels like you're counting carbs type of crust.  The sauce has a nice blend of seasonings - not too sweet and even a tiny hint of heat.  I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER.  Twice they've delivered the best pizza I can remember in YEARS. I'd have to make it myself for it to be any better (and I used to manage a pizzaria).  Their thick crust with extra mushrooms, light olives and italian sausage was AMAZING. Their kind and friendly staff also put on PERFECT portions for my super picky order. I even got a half and half pizza the second time and they did it perfect!"}
{"text":"Really pleased that Barros has moved into my neighborhood. They closed down the other one on Alma School and moved here. I've dined inside and ordered take-out from them. The place is super nice and they even have a kids corner off to the side. We typically order large pizzas and wings from them. The crust is a bit bready for my taste. I've even ordered thin crust and felt it was still a bit bready as well. We usually order from them when we throw large parties and they are usually right on time as far as my take out orders. I don't really have anything negative to say about them. Their customer service is great."}
{"text":"I always have a good a good experience here. The food is great, the service is average, the store is spacious and clean. Yes wait times are long but I personally feel it is worth the wait. Plus they are obviously busy because of high volumes of business."}
{"text":"Ok just moved to Az trying to find a good pizza has been so hard I heard great things about Barros and this is what I get... The whole pizza has slid to the side all topping in the corner of the box..."}
{"text":"I can always enjoy some Barros pizza. Especially when it's $4 for two slices of pizza and a drink. I went to this location for the first time and had 3 separate orders to make. The guy working was SO nice and patient with me. One of the totals came out to be $7.04... I handed him 7 and was about to grab some change, and he said, don't worry, I have the 4 cents. Wow. Yeah it's only 4 cents, but honestly how many people will say that to save someone's time finding change and just even consider helping someone out? I still gave him the change but still, that was so kind.  They ran out of pepperoni pizza so I had to wait a little. The rest of my food was sitting on the side while I grabbed some drinks and salads. Though it got very busy and he was helping other customers, he came back and told me the food was almost ready, and then packed everything up for me. Wow, I'm so impressed!"}
{"text":"(This is the correct location for this barro's, I'm not sure why there aren't more reviews? )  Excellent pizza. So good. Good service. I guess the review about the crust not having flavor could be true, but i don't find it to taste bland, really. And the toppings are plentiful, not like some other places. Plenty of cheese, too, no skimpy at all! I've ordered from the Barro's on power, and now this location. Same quality pizza, great crust, nice and thick and chewy. Cheese, delicious. Today i ordered an Italian sub, toasted with the dressing on the side so it wouldn't be soggy by the time it got here. To be honest I've had better Italian subs, but to be fair this one was pretty damn good. I'd order it again for sure. I think I'm just spoiled by Luke's Italian subs (in Tucson) and also spoiled by Eegee's Italian dressing and subs (also Tucson). Service is usually great, never had any problems. We order from them pretty often, they're consistent in quality of food and service. And I've never waited the full length of delivery time quoted to me. I love Barro's. (more than a person should love a pizza place.....)"}
{"text":"I have to award Barro's a 5 star review because everything about their pizza is delish!  Love the crust, sauce, gobs of mozzarella and the pepperoni.  My only comment for improvement would be to throw black olives on the pizza like there's no tomorrow!  I love Barro's and will return again and again."}
{"text":"Most Barros locations I have been too, are good.  This one was terrible.  We ordered some garlic bread to go with our pizza and what we got was burnt to a crisp on both sides.  When we asked for some ranch to dip it in, and help moisten it up, the answer was yes for an additional charge.  I would have asked for a refund, but we thought what's the point.  All the teenage girls working had an attitude as if they could care less."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Barro's pizza and usually visit at least once per week. But this particular location is usually a disappointment when it comes to the staff and operation. The pizza is always great but they are NEVER fully stocked in the lunch special and every time I go there I have to wait 10 to 20 minutes for another pizza to be made and put into the lunch rack. The staff is nice enough but it seems like the entire joint is run by high school kids. I have to usually keep any eye on the lunch rack and notify the staff that my slices are ready b/c they are never paying attention. Other Barro's locations have great service but this one seems to be in desperate need of an experienced manager to oversee the dining area and general operation. C'mon guys, pick up your game."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite pizza place in Scottsdale / Cave Creek."}
{"text":"What a great value for some excellent food!  Fast friendly service. Delicious food. I had a slice and a salad. . Pleasant atmosphere. Clean and bright.  Thanks. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has poor customer service. The two counter girls carry these hard ass attitudes. The girl that helped me wasn't friendly and didn't bother to say hi. She was also very short and when I was handed my food, which I could barely carry on my own, I wasn't offered any help. She actually didn't say a word when finishing my order. Customer service is something this place should work on."}
{"text":"Had the gluten free white pizza and added veggies.  Wonderful flavor and perfectly cooked.  Tasted great! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. However I can't give the establishment a 5 Star because I had my 5 month old daughter with me and there is nowhere to change a diaper in the bathroom. I had to hide out to change her diaper on one of the booths. That was a huge bummer."}
{"text":"Barros pizza is delicious!  They are my go to pizza place when I look for delivery.  I definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"I always call in my order & when I arrive I tell the girls that I'm picking up an order for 100 wings & 10 XL pizzas! I love to see them scramble looking for the non existing order. Finally I break & give them my real name & order & they crack up! This pizza is amazing! Wings are great & so is the salad bar!  Customer since 2008!  The dough is like no other in the 602!"}
{"text":"OK...I totally love Barros pizza and other menu items but this location is ridiculous. Forget about enjoying a nice cheat/pizza meal cause you'll feel like your at a Mormon circus with the 900 kids swarming everywhere! I just order it to go now but recognize its a gathering beacon for these folks. Have nothing against Mormons at all but its just a bit overwhelming being in this Barrows location because is loud, noisey and packed full of kids."}
{"text":"Love the veggie pizza from here! New soda machine gives a great selection. Service is always nice and polite."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings :) they have the best lunch deal and your order arrives on time not too long nor too fast."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Barro's Pizza -- didn't realize it was a chain so I was pleasantly surprised to find it near my current location.  The food was very good, the service sharp and the restaurant was fairly clean considering everyone we saw was probably under 20.    Toppings were generous, crust was above average and the flavors were full and fresh.  I'll probably return to this location as long as I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We love Barros and eat there or carry out all the time! Great boneless honey hot wings! I love their white pizza and the kids love their buffalo chicken pizza. Haven't had anything we don't like and the staff is always super friendly!!"}
{"text":"They refused service from a mountain point high swim and dive sponsor because all he had to pay for pizza ordered was a $100 bill. We have ordered from this Barro's for the last four years and paid cash. Sometimes with a large dollar bill sometimes with a smaller. The manager insulted by accusing him of it being a counterfeit bill.  Manager refused service. Also want to note that there is NOTHING posted regarding dollar bill size that they do or do not accept. We have many times in the past paid with a large bill.  Never been so insulted by a local restaurant that I have been going to for the last four plus years!"}
{"text":"I am in this Barro's ALOT.  The food is good, the prices are fantastic, but I can't say enough great things about their staff.  Alyssa, Tiffany and Hanna are very friendly and do a great job.  If they aren't helping someone, they are cleaning or prepping, etc.  There are others as well, but I don't know their names.  Their dining room is huge and can fit a lot of large groups too.  They recently upgraded their salad bar which has a lot more options."}
{"text":"We got a pizza and wings.  It was all really good and the ranch is amazing!!   but the place was a little dirty."}
{"text":"It's not my fault your order takers don't understand your delivery area and for you to send me back the same cold pizza and warm salad shows how fucked up your organization is. And then after being two hours late being asked to sign off on the charge? Really your organization can go to hell and I am contesting the charge with AMEX! RI DAMN DI CULOUS!"}
{"text":"We've come to this barros for a long time. We had a mishap with some undercooked wings and I sent an email just so they would know and hopefully no one else got sick but the manager credit our account $25 which I honestly wasn't even expecting I genuinely just wanted to let them know. Even with the credit we didn't end up eating here again until about 4 months later. We still got the credit even though it had been awhile and everyone is always so nice. Bomb pizza. Bomb ranch"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings! I really enjoyed the staff working there tonight plus the blonde manager... cashier girl messed up on our pizza (she was very apologetic which was nice) and they quickly made us a new one even though we said the messed up pizza is fine to us. first time at this location and we WILL be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"The meatball subs are phenomenal. I've eaten their lunch special pizza almost every day for the last year, and it's well worth the wait to have a fresh-out-the-oven slice. The staff are super accommodating, and very charismatic. Try a bazookie for a nice treat, I've never had a cookie from here that was even too crispy, let alone burnt."}
{"text":"This is definitely just the fast food, delivery style pizza that Lauren V. spoke of.   And she is correct, it is \"some good damn pizza\".  The ingredients seemed fresh, the crust is terrific.  There is some substance to it.   I enjoyed the fact that is wasn't a sloppy greasy mess where all the toppings fall off when you pick it up.  I didn't have it delivered so I can't rate that aspect of the place.  But for take out pizza, if this place is close to you then you're pretty lucky and should try some."}
{"text":"I thought pizza was okay ir tasted salty i probably wont order again so the price was fair felt dissatisfied and thats that"}
{"text":"Great place fora  large group. We had 40 people for a team dinner. They reserved an area that was set aside which was the perfect size for everyone. Service was wonderful. We didn't have to wait long for pizza. Pizza was amazing as always."}
{"text":"Good service, and delicious food, everything is always fresh and tasty. The beer, pizza, and wings are a great combo to get when dining here. The delivery service is also a great perk when you don't feel like driving."}
{"text":"I really love Barros pizza and have become a weekly orderer. I usually order from various other locations and my last order was from this one.  I love how cheesy the pizza is and it's a bit on the salty side which I like. While I was waiting for my delivery to arrive I saw recent poor reviews about customer service, product, and rude delivery drivers (different review site) so I was a bit nervous how my experience would be. We got our pizza timely and the delivery guy was great, very personable. Half of the pizza was wet soggy dough. We did get mushroom and black olives which are wet items so maybe the preparer didn't let the juices run off before putting them on the pizza? Not sure. We called to let them know we weren't able to eat it in this condition (first time I've had to call with a complaint). The manager was extremely curteous, apologized, and even though it was 20 minutes before their closing time they promptly sent us a replacement pizza. We received zero rudeness.  I was very satisfied with my experience here,  kudos! The only reason I've given 4 stars is because I've had 5 star pizzas, simple explanation. Way to go Barros, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Under new management - mid-February 2015!!!  Awesome and consistent food... good service, GREAT lunch special pricing AND everyday specials!!!  I love to dip my pizza in their ranch!  AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!!!  I've been eating at Barro's since high school!!!  (25 years - and so glad they have one out by me now!!)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Called in a pick up order and when I arrived there was already a line formed all the way outside the entrance. Wondering why it was so crowded but after eating thier food I can see why. Regardless, staff was friendly and attentive to any needs you may have with your order. Will be sure to come again for my pizza cravings"}
{"text":"We love Barros, and this place holds up to the same standard everywhere else we have gone"}
{"text":"Went in because they have gluten free pizza and those that needed it were impressed. I on the other hand prefer my pizza with extra gluten and I really enjoyed it. The crust is nice and crisp and the toppings are plentiful.   They have an area where the kids congregate so I would stay away from there unless you have kids with you or like watching parents let their kids roam free.   The pizza is good though so stay away from the kids area and you are good."}
{"text":"Not sure why such high reviews.  Other than the friendly girl at the front counter this was pretty mediocre.  There was a kind-of dirty-plus-cleaning products odor to the place, there was a bussing tray sitting right next to the ordering counter the whole time.  The seats still had crumbs on them and the table some grease spots.  There's no ambiance and are no amenities - pizza delivered on a plastic tray, cheap plastic dishes for eating it, paper or styrofoam cups for the serve-yourself drinks.  This isn't an imaginative Italian restaurant with good food, table service,and nice tables and chairs.  It's a cheap pizza place with vinyl booths, windows with hand prints, and get-it-yourself silverware.  The food - well, it was fine for the price, but there are tons of places that serve decent pizza these days.  Granted this was better pizza than, say, Domino's, but that doesn't say too much.  There was a decent amount of cheese, but it's not like the quality of ingredients particularly stood out.  Pale tasteless tomato chunks, for example.  I didn't see that this Barro's, at least, had much to recommend it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat (too much pizza) here at least once a week. Their lunch deals are just unbeatable. Huge amounts of great food for very little money. Personally, I think this location has the best pizza, since the taste does vary a bit from location to location."}
{"text":"After trying lots of other pizzas in Surprise I was picking up a package at the Walmart Neighborhood Store and saw lots of people going into Barro's. I had not yet tried Barro's and it was close to dinner so I gave it a try. Ordered an original crust pepperoni and a antipasto salad. Whoa it was totally great. The sauce was thick and flavorful while the crust was perfect and too tasty. The salad was also really a treat and enough for two meals. After having a great pizza I checked Yelp and also found good reviews. Good to see others agree. My wife and now get a Barro's pizza at least twice a month. Also a good place to pick up a pizza for any Sunday game."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza has been around for years in Cave Creek. Their pizza is always made consistently and while the crust resembles a frozen pizza crust, it has a thick chewy almost bread like consistency. Perhaps the best feature is their salad bar, it is always good,and they offer nice cold beer. What is never good is the incredibly inconsistent service, ranging from pleasant to downright rude. The staff is poorly managed, clearly, and has been for the years we have been going here. Because the kitchen is usually very busy, and there is a sense of hustle going on, the customers are treated more like cattle moving through the restaurant, than important guests. Still, it is difficult to complain about their pizza. While Rays pizza is a much better product all around, and the service is much better, they do not have a salad bar. For this area of town, these are really the only two decent pizza places for a good price."}
{"text":"I love there pizza and wings . I just think they need a lil renovation and fix the smell that might be coming from the restroom ."}
{"text":"So I really wanted some pasta and my son hot wings. I orders spaghetti plain with meat balls and the food for my son. Everything comes out separately so I get that all the food will not be at your table at one time...I get it!! So a while goes by and no pasta!! Ask the waitress and they lost my damn ticket...hence no pasta. Then they say I will get a refund but the manager does not show up to my table! So guess I will go make an ass of my self at the order counter...to be continued! Hot wings are hella good though!"}
{"text":"I love this place...pretty good pizza for Az...being a Chicago girl it's hard to expect much but I am pleasantly surprised by this place...we eat here a lot : )"}
{"text":"Barros is Barros.  Always great pizza.  Definitely top five in the valley.  Been eating Barros since they only had one store on 7th Street.....yeah, I'm old, so what?"}
{"text":"I work at a pizza shop, so I know good pizza. This place is bomb. The workers are good people too. Their lunch special is good, but if they offered wings with it like some other Barros then they'd get five stars.  Oh, and their slices are slightly smaller than other Barros. But hey, who's perfect? This is a solid location."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the valley! !   Great atmosphere  one of the few pizza shops with a sit down style restaurant.  Service can be slow sometimes so we call and order to dine in over the phone."}
{"text":"Barros has great pizza, (however I consider almost all pizza great pizza), however I was a bit disappointed when I called tonight and my pizza was going to take two hours for delivery. I called Taste of Italy down the road and got the same pizza with a 30-45 minute delivery time and much cheaper...  Fast forward 30 minutes: Taste of Italy delivers my pizza and it is officially my new favorite. The medium is about the size of barros large (maybe that's just my perception because I'm starving) but it's amazing. My tip is hit up taste of Italy if barros wait is long.. Or Just in general since they are a great family company with amazing pizza and even more Italian entrees than barros."}
{"text":"Their buffalo chicken pizza is the best! We get it thin crust & burned (They code it \"well done\") $17.99 for an extra large which feeds this family of 5 - the bottom of the pizza box is wicked greasy , but well worth the impending heart attack  . we have tried a few other variations of their pizza , but I have to be fair and say that streets of New York has better cheese pizza"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Wings, and  Beer.  Had the sweet red chilli wings . Great  sauce and very meaty. We like the Barro  special pizza, especially  the thin sliced  veggies. Great service by staff, you order at the counter and they  bring your order to your table.  Staff even checked in with the table midway and brought wet wipes.   Best thing. ....best prices in town for craft  beer. $3 dollar pints, $4.50 mugs and $9 pitchers. You might be walking home!"}
{"text":"We had Barro's last night for the first time at this location. We dined in and had a good experience. The restaurant dining area is pretty big and was really full on a Friday night. You place your order at the front before seating yourself. The young lady helping us at the cash register was so young but she definitely knew what she was doing. I had a coupon for 25% off that was happily accepted.  We ordered six hot boneless buffalo wings and a medium pizza with pepperoni, green peppers and jalapenos. The wings came out first and were really good. Crispy on the outside and the hot sauce had a great flavor. The pizza was cooked perfectly and had a nice crispy crust and soft and fluffy texture. Being from Michigan, I love Chicago style pizza and I think I have found one of my new go to's.   Did not order beer or wine on this visit but did notice that they have great prices on both. I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Definite favorite for our family, both delivery and dine-in.  Dine in is great for families with younger kids.  Seating in the back has small kid tables and play kitchen for them to have fun.  TV is also typically turned into kid's channel.  Food is awesome, and price is worth it."}
{"text":"I can only give this venue \"5\" fabulous stars. I grew up on Barro's Pizza and this particular location was one of my regularly top spots. It is amazing how the quality of this pizza after so many years has NEVER changed. It is amazing watching this company grow throughout the valley. Locations all over.  You want thick pizza with a special sweet sauce that treats the taste buds. This is the place. I had a late night craving and brought a friend of mine from Boston to give it a try. Now as I mentioned she is from Boston and knows great pizza. Since you can find pizza joints at almost any corner. We split a medium pizza and 12 Honey Hot Wings. She was in love. Barro's cooks their food fresh. You can tell only fresh ingredients are used because the quality of the pizza is amazing. The level of customer service is top notch as well. One of the managers who has worked there for years is very friendly not only to his patrons but his staff.  Barro's has daily specials. You can go in for lunch and grab a slice with a drink. They also have a salad bar. This is a great location to take a team after a sporting game because it is inexpensive and taste great."}
{"text":"My Family and I went to Barros this last weeken, the pizza was great and the service as well, my grandchildren love the idea of unlimted drinks. we"}
{"text":"Barros is definitely a solid pizza spot. This one right here is right by my house and I have always had good experiences with them. Tonight I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and they accidentally made me a medium hot wing pizza. I wasn't too upset about it but the guy behind the counter who appeared to be the manager, told me that he was making me my pepperoni and it would be ready in five minutes and also that I can take the hot wing pizza home also. He then proceeded to give me a free found soda while I waited. Great service and great Za! I'm actually pretty hyped about it because I've never tried the hot wing pizza so it all worked out. Five stars for you my good man!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent the 7th Street and Coral Gables location because this Thunderbird location never seems to get my order right.  This last order they forgot to include a small side order and hung up on me after about a 10 minute hold.  They obviously had my phone number since I had just ordered 15 minutes before, but no call back.  Oh well....I guess I will stick with the other location."}
{"text":"I come here a few times a month and it's great every time. The BBQ chicken pizza is fantastic. The staff is always super friendly. The prices are pretty standard for this area."}
{"text":"I used to love their pizza. Been eating it since I was 10. And now they switch to Pepsi. As Mark Cuban says, for that reason, I'm out."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering from Barro's for years it's probably our favorite pizza place in town! We order from this location pretty regularly (about once every two weeks) and never have issues and the pizza is always great! Last night we put in an order for pickup for a few pizzas and wings, after getting home I realized the didn't give me one of our pizzas. It was partially my fault too I should've noticed before I left but the box that the breadsticks came in threw me off for being another pizza. Anyways, I called in to let them know I didn't get one of my pizzas and was transferred to a manager, I believe her name was Sunny, and she was just great! She was so friendly and apologetic and offered to have a new one delivered to me in 20 minutes. I only live about 5 minutes away thought so I told her I didn't mind coming back to pick it up and she said leave now it will be done in 5 minutes and ready when you get here- and it was! Once I got there she also threw in a free salad and 2 liter of soda without me even asking for anything extra. We were satisfied with the pizza like always and even more satisfied with the customer service from this place! We are customers for life"}
{"text":"I've always loved the massive amounts of cheese with an awesome crust. I always het sausage & mushroom. Management is always very attentive & fair uike other pizza places in this area. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Barros is one of my favorite pizza places. Takeout large pizza and wings deal is awesome."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here since they opened!   We loved in it Phoenix and it's just as good here!  Tonight we picked up our to-go order as always and they sent us home with the wrong pizza.  The receipt was right,  pizza was wrong.  We ordered a large hot wing but received a large pepperoni.  We also ordered breadsticks with ranch but they gave us marinara.  I can say that in the 10 or more years we've been eating here and ordering from here that I cannot remember another time when our order was wrong so for that I can't be too upset!  Also when I called I was given to the manager John.  My only request was that they send a driver to deliver the correct order and trade.  Not only was he quick to agree to that but he was also going to have the order remade,  which was not necessary so I simply requested a trade for mine that I knew was still fresh.  The correct order was delivered fairly prompt and still hot and for that they get my 4 star review!   Everyone makes mistakes. .. Its how you resolve them that you earn respect, at least from me!   Thank you Barros for our delicious dinner and kudos to John for your professionalism!   As always. .. we'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered 12 wings, hot and crispy. These were wings! Actually wings!! I'm a recent transfer from Buffalo, NY we call \"Buffalo wings\" and \"Hot wings\"... wings. These are authentic. They'd be good wings in Buffalo. Extremely fast delivery. Very friendly driver. Pizza was good. Ordered large with pepperoni and green olives. Quite a bit of pepperoni, very thinly sliced, and lots of olives.   Get the wings!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything less than a great experience with Barro's! The location closest to my current home has always been perfect; there is nothing I could complain about! Food, service, and delivery drivers are exceptional and I recommend this place to everyone! My most recent experience was 10 minutes prior to closing and 'Lauren' took my order at the Scottsdale/Greyhawk location and she was friendly, knowledgeable, and kind. I appreciate good, friendly service and places like my Barro's deserve more positive reviews! Yelp reviewers who use foul language and choose to personally attack employees should not ever be listened to. Thank you again for the prompt and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but the place is dirty. Hardly any customers but nobody picks up the tables after customers leave. Even the floor is pretty dirty  we got our pizza still no staff doing anything but gossiping. What a shame drank our beer took pizza home."}
{"text":"Love this place but wish they had slices throughout the day. They so them at 3:00. Not a huge deal breaker, but what makes this place a 4 star, not 5. The subs are great too"}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza from here. It was delicious but the mango habanero wings were AMAZING!!! I am so happy to have fantastic wings so close."}
{"text":"Always a good choice. Love there boneless BBQ wings! We eat here at least once a month."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Barros and got an XL pepperoni and 24 wings. The pizza here is AMAZING! It's hard to go anywhere else, get pizza, and say it's good after eating Barro's. The whole pizza, cheese, sauce, crust, pepperoni, and spices make this pizza extremely tasty. Again, I cannot reiterate how good it tastes. The wings, were meh, and a little soggier than what I prefer. The buffalo sauce tasted good, but I think the wings would be better if the either fried them or baked them a little longer. I wanted to give them 5 stars overall but feel all items should be up to par to earn this rating. The wings need a little work but were not bad. The pizza is for sure 5 stars. The price is decent too."}
{"text":"Honestly, horrible customer service and overall experience. The smallest order of wings includes TWELVE of them and they don't offer half and half wing flavors. Step up your game, Barro's."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas online for carryout since this was one of the closest pizza spots nearby. I was surprised at how long the line was to order but I did come around noon which is a busy lunch time. I was able to go right to the cashier to pick up my order since I had already paid online.   Loved how quick and easy it was and the pizzas were tasty. I'd be back to try their lunch specials, they've got some good deals!"}
{"text":"I'm Jessica's fiancee. But still, our experience last night compelled me to write this review.  Anywho, I'm relatively new to Arizona, just moved here about 2 months ago. The food here, especially the pizza, is of a much higher quality than what I'm used to from most places back in Columbus, Ohio. That being said, I have run into a disaster of a pizza place already (Jamie's Pizza and Pitas.) So, we immediately set out the next night to make amends.  The interior of the shop has a very laid back vibe, mostly clean; but still some icky tables here and there.   She ordered a white pizza, I ordered a plain cheese, 6 medium wings, and 2 draft beers (don't worry, one was for Jess!)  Our first sign that we could tell this place was going to be a hit was when the cashier forgot to ring up 2 beers on the order, so she gave us one of our pints for free; even upgraded it to a Devil's Ale instead of a Coors. I went to San Tan Brewery within my first week here, so I was extremely happy this was on tap somewhere else.  Onto the Food: The wings were extremely fresh, although they were on the dry side. Decent flavor to the sauce for only ordering Medium, but it's something I wouldn't get in the future.   The pizza's were great, although i think the crust could've used a minute less in the oven. Still, there was a nice, fresh chew to it; very hearth-y. The cheese was the star of the show, especially on the white pizza. Melted to perfection, and extremely generous on both pies. The sauce, however, seemed to be the only flaw. That paste-like texture is never really a good thing, although, it was nowhere near the worst sauce a pizza has seen. The white pizza had a nice garlic infusion, but wasn't overpowering in the least. The first white pizza I've had that I can truly say I've liked.  TL;DR: 5 stars for the excellent customer service, comped craft beer, and extremely cheesy pizzas. This place has become my go-to joint, along with Venezia's."}
{"text":"Food was great. We had a large pie, Cesar salad and wings. Pizza was very good deep fried wings were on the money. Trouble was kitchen was behind. Timing was terrible. Beers then pizza then salad. No wings came out until I reminded them. The wait staff was good but over shadowed by something beyond their control. It was a Friday so I will give them the benefit of doubt, and would probably return but next time there can't be a miss.  3 reflects the kitchen timing."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza with a great taste and crust. We received excellent service and enjoyed the sports/family atmosphere. Visiting from out of the area and we definitely will be back. Our kids devoured the pizza and breadsticks."}
{"text":"We really love Barro's  and when we aren't in Phoenix in the summer that is all we want! Al other pizzas pale in comparison. Love their original crust but their thin crust is good too. The daisy is yummy and they don't skimp on the toppings."}
{"text":"Ordered the wings...boneless honey BBQ. My friend ordered the Italian sub, heated. We shared the food and it was very yummy. However, the wings came out way before the sub. The sub came out almost towards the end of us finishing off the wings.  All in all, it was good food."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I asked well done pizza & wings, it wasn't even a little done. The cheese was a sloppy, the pepperoni were literally thrown on there. The owner or manager was really rude. Horrible experience! Very disappointed because I had heard plenty of good things about barros."}
{"text":"I ordered a X- Large pizza, The toppings were great but the pizza was uncooked and doughy. 30 Dollars later not happy...."}
{"text":"I order pizza and wings here normally on Mondays. It's just my Monday thing. I really should start cooking more, but you know how it goes. You get home from work, you suffered all day from the Mondays. The last thing you want to do is cook. I always call in our order and just swing by and pick it up. The Barro's Special is really really good. I'd say that's my favorite, but my kids don't like all that extra jazz, so for them, I just order the pepperoni. Do yourself a favor and not cook. Just call them and pick up a pizza. If that's too much, they deliver too!"}
{"text":"It was a mess from the get go. i told the woman (who spoke WAY to fast) what I wanted. She repeated the order I made last time (which was NOT what I wanted) but knew I wanted a large. showed up to get it and they made what I ordered last time. i will give them credit for making the correct size pizza ASAP but will probably go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"After ordering here for 2 years I thought it was time to leave a review. We love the pizza it is always hot and full of flavor. The breadsticks with cheese are very tasty and the marina you can get with it, oh so good. I wish they sold big containers of the marina!  The boneless wings are really good just the right amount of sauce. The staff is always friendly and smiling and they have never messed up an order."}
{"text":"This pizza was a pleasant surprise!  I was staying in Phoenix, and wanted a pizza delivery.  I saw that Barro's delivered, and decided that was good enough for me.  They had the pizza to me in 45 minutes, which was great for a Friday night, and it was delicious! I wanted a gluten free crust, and you never know how that might turn out, but this crust was amazingly good!  I definitely recommend Barro's when you're visiting Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Barros is my favorite go to! But this location has the worst customer service. I do not recommend this place to anyone, I prefer going to the one on Brown."}
{"text":"Always a great place for pizza and wings . We always come here but this recent time we went we were just about done eating when I saw a cockroach crawling from beneath the table . I was so grossed out .. Will not be returning back to this one . Staff is always friendly but there's no better way to ruin your meal then by noticing a creepy crawler .."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza!  The wings will be the true test lol unfortunately they have suckers  at the door when we walked in and that created a monster aka my 2 year went NUTZ and flipped out because I wouldn't  allow it before the meal then I couldn't  get one after cuz that behavior  was insain!  Needless to say we cleared the place out with that tantrum.  NOT anyone's fault but maybe that urged them to move em lol.  My daughter  LITERLALLY cleared the place out."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. The service was friendly and fast. The lunch deals,are deals. I got two pieces and a drink. The pizza was really good. I will stop here again."}
{"text":"Meat Lovers pizza:  They must use some sort of meat that is loaded with salt...wow!  Really bad.  Reallllly salty.  Never again. And I heard so many rave about Barro's...what happened?  Update: Ate there a second time and the pizza was okay--not great but good.  Ate there a third time last night and the pizza I had and my friend had was SOGGY!  Yes, soggy!  We are guessing they froze the cheese, used it while it was still frozen as there was such a rush of a crowd and it made the pizza literally drip--yes, you read that right--with a watery substance.  NEVER AGAIN...and this time I mean it...NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Always fairly clean and staff is friendly. Great lunch specials when you're in the area. Plus barros pizza is always great."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss with these guys. Their pizza is excellent. Occasionally their wait time is atrocious. I think it depends which crew is on duty. Have had pizza prepared and ready in 15 minutes, and other times where even though the order was phoned in, and was given a 15 minute completion time, the pizza didn't appear for 45 minutes. Actually they hadn't even begun the order when I arrived 20 minutes after the call.  Girls on duty just shrugged....no reason or apologies given."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and great prices! My husband wanted a buffalo wing pizza and I only wanted a little bit of pizza but don't like buffalo sauce so they did a quarter of the pizza pepperoni for me and the man I spoke with on the phone was very polite and kind. I would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"asked the employee Alexis if there were any specials and she replied \"just the ones we have everyday\". sorry if i'm not in the know of the special they have everyday, but i felt she was perturbed that i asked about it. Are you that tired of telling paying customers what your daily special is? a person shouldn't be made to feel like they're wasting the employees time asking questions. i like the pizza there but that's about it. from now on i'll see about going to a different place."}
{"text":"It seems that practically everyone who lives in Phoenix has been to Barro's except me. Despite living here for over a decade, I've just never had the urge to try them. And it seems that most people that are reviewing Barro's are reviewing the location itself rather than the food. Me? I'll stick with the food.  I ordered a mini 8\" pizza, which is pretty dirt cheap at five bucks. A dollar added per topping. Hell, I even got a little wild and reckless and decided to order a small spaghetti as well. For the price, it's quite a lot of food. Far more than I expected, which is probably why this place seems to be a go-to alternative to big-time chains for people hosting parties or events where massive amounts of food are required.  As for the mini 8 incher, it was sort of what I expected. Overwhelmingly cheesy, minimal flavor depth, and a crispy crust that is a step above what you'd obtain at your national chains. And if that's what you're using for comparison, then yeah, I'm sure it's amazing. But I assure you, this isn't the end-be-all pizza that some are describing it as. It's a step above Little Caesars, Dominos, or Papa John's, but we all know that the bar is already set pretty low with those joints.  The spaghetti and a single meatball was standard stuff, comparable to what most of these places pass off as pasta. It's nothing horrific, but it's not particularly great either. I found it to be quite heavy on the stomach. The garlic bread, which I wasn't really expecting, just tasted like it was old.  I'm glad to say that I've finally crossed Barro's off my list, but it's a \"one and done\" deal for me. There are too many other pizza joints I'd rather dine at. But maybe one day if I don't feel like leaving the house and in the mood for delivery, I'll give them a call."}
{"text":"My husband really loves the pizza and salad combos. I've only had the antipasto salad which wasn't very good and the club sandwich (turkey, ham & roast beef) that was disgusting. Nasty meat, lots of mayo and just poor poor quality in every way. Go for the cheap pizza lunch combos and I wouldn't get anything else."}
{"text":"There's been a BOOM of pizza joints in the last couple of years.  Some good, some exceptional and some lack luster.  All of them trying to earn our business and our hard earned bucks. Barros is consistent.  I like that. They continue to provide exceptional customer service.  The beer selection is still better than some nearby bars.  Atmosphere is keeping with a family theme without the excessive arcade games, tickets earned, Made in China trinkets, cartoon characters or the organ music. And pizza is solid good.  Gimme thin crust and nobody gets hurt. Hey, I'm thoroughly enjoying all the best pizza options around the Valley, but Barros is the real winner for consistency and good taste."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza.  Fair beer selection.  Blah wings.  Clean place.  Super friendly staff. This is my favorite pizza here in the Valley. Dump the chains and support a GREAT local business. It isn't what I think of when you say Chicago style (crust) but we keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Got there about 6  and went to the counter to order. Two female employees, one helping a customer the other on the phone with a customer. She hung up and said something very derogatory. When you do something like that when all the customers in front of you can hear we then all know how you feel about us.  Customers are the reason you have a job. It didn't stop there however because people are allowed to have emotions. That attitude carried over to the staff. No follow up at all the entire time we were there.  This is my 4th Barrows to go to and he first three were amazing in customer service, quality and cleanliness. If this had been the first one I went to I would consider some other mediocre pizza joint.  Managers set the tempo for attitude and work ethic. This manager needs an evaluation or a vacation."}
{"text":"We're regulars and have been coming here for years! Owner and staff are very friendly! They not only serve the best pizza and wings in the valley, but also care about the community!"}
{"text":"This place has solid pizza and the wings are above average.  Get the breadsticks with cheese on them.  It's pretty amazing.   iOS the best pizza place in Surprise and it blows away the others here."}
{"text":"I love Barro's Pizza. It is probably my favorite \"delivery\" pizza. Although it is more expensive then the other guys, IMO, it is worth it. At the end of the day, you do get what you pay for with the quality of their ingredients."}
{"text":"The family and I have been to this location numerous times since it has opened. The pizza (Barro's Special) has always been good and the beer cold. The service is sometimes spotty, but not terrible. It has recently improved. We always dine-in and have enjoyed ourselves. We do recommend to others to visit."}
{"text":"Thought the pizza here was OK. I was hungry at the time and it was a work sponsored function, which helps.   I had a slice of cheese, pepperoni and a meats option. The sauce was fine, the crust was pretty good, everything about the experience was just decent. It's a big place, so it's good for groups or an event. We were there right before a spring training game, and it was a convenient location to where we ended up.   Service was good, very attentive. Our waitress was always coming along, making sure drinks were filled, etc. No small feat for someone handling 30+ people.   One note: Their wings were actually really good. I tried a honey BBQ and a buffalo wing and was impressed. Those alone made up for the so-so pizza."}
{"text":"Spectacular Pies, wings & salads outta this spot. Barro's saved the day with their food to satiate fam flying in from Chicago, LA, San Francisco all arriving to the Tempe HQ HUNGRY! All mouths were fed & people happy. White pizza was the favorite. Gluten free pizza was good. Salads crispy & generous with the dressing. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Fresh pizza is usually better than the by-the-slice. Affordable and quick, staff is young and fun\nice. Great neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times since my last review and the pizza has never been excessively salty.  Also discovered honey hot boneless wings and me likey-likey!!"}
{"text":"Best traditional pizza in the area. I like the thin crust. Consistently cooked the way I like it, with the cheese slightly brown. Well priced."}
{"text":"Good pizza work right down the road enjoy them once or twice a week. Great lunch price"}
{"text":"We are big fans of this Barro's location! We usually grab a pizza to go. Good quality, great price, and fresh hot. The staff here is SUPER friendly, and very accommodating. Always nice and clean, and cool in the seating area.  You can tell this particular Barro's is well managed. In fact, you see the managers working just as hard as the employees. We live farther north, but prefer this location because of the AWESOME service."}
{"text":"I eat at this location pretty regular. I have never had bad service, never had bad food. But tonight especially was awesome we called for a large pizza i went to pick it up and the manager tells me he has an extra large prepped so we got upgraded for no extra charge. Me and my family really enjoy this location."}
{"text":"Have fun and Enjoy your possible hospital visit!!!!! Barro's Pizza Boneless chicken wings put me in a bed for 37 days and I lost 46 lbs because there careless attitude and not fully cooking chicken properly. When I could stand up My wife and I went back and just wanted an Apology nothing more the Freaking Mgr at 25th and Thunderbird laughed about it and said that was what happens when you eat out you take chances :Screw Barro's Pizza\" I have pissed on there name for 4 yrs now. I will never say 1 positive word or ever walk into that dump ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just wanted to let you know who and what jerks hands your putting your health into"}
{"text":"SUCH AMAZING PIZZA!! they make real pizza here, fresh and hearty. takes about 30 minutes per order, but well worth the wait. lots of wait staff, huge seating area inside w/ tons of TVs. great atmosphere, but you should really just come here for the PIZZA. I've never tried anything else. They sell pizza by the slice at Lunch Time too :)"}
{"text":"not much to say about there pizza. its just ok. There is way to many places making pizza like this and i dont understand how they are still in business. cheap? i guess"}
{"text":"Love the food..... Never an issue. I have however had issues with timing and getting my order right. Continue to return because the pizza is great and the kids love it."}
{"text":"Just call into the Anthem Barros and they won't deliver 2.1 miles South of their location. The lady told me to call the Scottsdale location because I don't live in Anthem.  LOST ALL MY BUSINESS AND WELL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW THAT LIVES OUT HERE. It's sad but Anthem Streets of NY will. That's a pretty DUMB manager to turn away ANY business!!!! I wouldn't even give them 1 star!!"}
{"text":"Great service and quick delivery. This location is one of the best in the valley. Wings and pizza are always hot when they show up."}
{"text":"I received a 25% coupon (expires 3/15/15) in a mailer that is valid at all east valley location and they won't honor it. They said they stopped taking the coupons? I just received it a few days ago. LAME!!!  This is not the first time they pulled this crap on me. Never buying from them again. Hope they looose lots of customers for these kind of tactics. Luckily I called the store first to make sure they would honor it before placing an order. Don't waste your money...go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza fan, and I will always be up for an order from Barros. That's how amazing it is.  First off, ordering on the phone is so simple.  Usually I'm already in the system and I don't need to give them all the crazy address and direction information that I hate repeating every time I call somewhere.  Secondly, their delivery is speedy gonzales quick. I don't know how they do it, but it arrives well before I think it will and is piping hot and fresh.  Third, the prices are reasonable and they aren't afraid to give me food without tomatoes. The dough is fantastic, and it's easily become one of the favorite delivery spots for the crew in my hood!"}
{"text":"They pizza is good but there chicken wings are not so good they never really have any sauce on them even when I ask for extra they suck in the chicken wing department!!"}
{"text":"Always order here! Staff is always upbeat and nice even when it is chaotic inside most of the time!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Phoenix!! Can eat here every night! Been here close to 20 times an never been bad! Always good food and the cashiers are always friendly an the manager really cares about the customer an makes sure your experience is a good one!!"}
{"text":"Be careful they serve up Raw chicken wings!!!!!!! Then customer satisfaction means nothing to these people. Jamie the ASS. Manager. Very rude.  I use yelp a lot but have never written a review.  First time. Just thought everyone should now be careful!"}
{"text":"We order from here a lot !! Their pizza is great and if you like salads they have a killer one called the Anti pasta it's covered in deli meat !! Love barros !!"}
{"text":"I am increasing the rating because management did reach out about the issue. I have not returned, but will. I'm encouraged that they at least do care!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in Surprise,  for dine in, delivery or carryout. The dining room is very nice. We love to get a few slices for lunch. The wings are so good. We usually eat at barros once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I've always loved Barro's pizza but I hardly ever order it because I know if I did I would eat all of it in one sitting (one of the downsides/perks to living alone).  Then one day one of my coworkers brought in a little box and said they have lunch specials where you can get just a slice!  I decided to check it out on my lunch a few days later.  Unfortunately they stop serving the pizza by the slice at 3:00 and I got there around 4 so I decided since I was there I might as well just get a small pizza and then share with my coworkers.  The wait for it wasn't too long, about 10-15 minutes and I think it was only around $7 or so.  About the same as you'd pay for a lunch anywhere else.  It was hot, cheesy, melty, gooey, and delicious.  I still want to try to get there for a slice one of these days but I mean really any form Barro's pizza comes in you know it's going to be delicious."}
{"text":"I feel like Barro's is so good it barely even needs a review so I'll keep it brief. I put in an order for pickup, showed up a little early but it was ready to go so I didn't have to wait.  The girl at the counter was friendly and of course the pizza itself (a mini White pizza, perfect for 1 person!) was delicious.  I'm obviously going to be coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered a dozen hot wings to go.    Waited about 15 minutes for them,  but considering I didn't call ahead,  that's not bad for a Friday. They were cooked perfectly,  deep fried and tossed in their tangy, tasty sauce.  Their \"hot\" wasn't as spicy as I'd expect \"hot\"  to be,  so next time I'll order \"fire\".   My biggest complaint was the dirty carpets.   They may want to go all tile or wood floors if they ever do a remodel.  Ottherwise the place looked clean and well thought out.  Since I didn't eat in,  it didn't really bother me that much.   Overall, a good experience,  I was in and out fairly quickly for a Friday night,  I had some good wings,  so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came to this Barros after a football game with my son's team. I had never really been to a Barros before. In fact, I've only had a slice of pizza from another party in the past. But we've ordered 25 pizzas at a time from a different location and experienced bad service. So trying this one out, I was a bit hesitant.   But this location set a different tone. From the time we got here to the time our entire group left, the manager and other employees made sure our party was ok. Which I thought was great because honestly at places like this, they could care less.   We ordered a few pizzas... cheese, pepperoni and combo, along with their salads. Was surprised that the Sicilian salad even without dressing was really refreshing with plenty of meat! But don't go without their ranch! It's soooooo good!"}
{"text":"been going here for years, there is something spacial about Barros. just taste so good and different the other pies"}
{"text":"Good food, but if you go to pick up your order when they tell you 25 minutes just figure 45. It happens every single time. Then I'm stuck just sitting waiting for 20 minutes when I have things I need to get done."}
{"text":"SOOOO me being the creepy 21 year old haha. The Hostess or front desk girls.. are alsways really pretty. Everyone there seems to be really nice also. ALaways deals sent out for their pretty good pizza. And I even use to work at  a pizza place back in Ohio. I even liked their wings i got on superbowl."}
{"text":"I've only ever had delivery from this location, but it's always been stellar. Once, the delivery guy asked if we wanted a free pizza, since the previous order decided they didn't want it. It was chicken with pineapple, which I had never had and I figured \"why not\"? Well, that became my favorite pizza after that! Sooo good!  But, we order mostly wings. Wings, wings, wings oh how I love you. We (almost) never have a problem and the literal one time that we did, it was fixed immediately. The one and only negative that I can say was that I tried to order on Halloween a few years ago an hour and a half before closing and the guy who picked up the phone told me the manager wanted to leave so they closed early. But, that would make this 4.9 out of 5 stars... so I round up :)"}
{"text":"We were out riding around and stopped for lunch. Pleasantly surprised that the food was so good. Modest prices. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Barros has been everyone's favorite since I can remember! Fresh ingredients, yummy combinations, and great prices. This new location, or perhaps over the years, however has not met the standards (the standards it's set for itself and others). The pizza bread could use 5 more minutes baking, and the cheese just doesn't have the freshness it use to. The prices have continued to trend up little by little despite its quality diminishing. Hoping it'll return to its roots one day."}
{"text":"We ordered a specialty pizza (chicken wing) to try Barro's for the first time.  The pizza overall was ok.  The cheese and chicken tasted the best and of good quality.  The wing sauce tasted a bit on the greasy side, and the crust will thick, somewhat tasted of frozen quality.  The price for this large specialty pie came to $18.  I generously gave this place and this pizza a 3, but the with the high price and crust quality could easy have dropped to a 2.  This wasn't what I expected, but would consider giving them another chance."}
{"text":"Good pizza but.... a 40 minute wait on 2 take out pizzas turned into a one hour wait.  There were about  10 others waiting as long or longer than me for pickup orders when they quoted  40 minutes for pickup.  I arrived about 35 minutes into my quoted time then spent a hour waiting.   :o)"}
{"text":"Always reliable for stellar pizza.  The bbq chicken has some kick to it which i love as well!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Barros since their old location on Kyrene and Warner (it's moved since then) sponsored my softball games in middle school. Yeah, so you can say I'm a loyalist.  Here's the thing about pizza: it's pizza. It's always going to be decent, even when it's terrible. So you got your tiers of pizza, right? For cheap pizza, I don't think that Costco can be beaten. If you want to impress a date and rub elbows with the trendy and famous, Pizzeria Bianco is where it's at.  But if you want good, solid, middle-of-the-road pizza, Barros cannot be beat. Their cheese is always plentiful, buttery, and properly stringy. Their sauce is hearty -- not too sweet, and not too spicy -- with a \"real\" tomato flavor you're not going to get from Digiorno or Pizza Hut. They're always super generous with their toppings as well, and I've never had a compliant about the quality. The green peppers are always crisp, the mushrooms meaty, the Italian sausage just the right balance of spicy and savory.  Plus, they deliver. Oh, and they're local and definitely into supporting the community. I grew up with basically all of my middle school and high school functions being sponsored by Barros, eating their pizza at student council, in softball, at summer camp, and so many other places. I also used to walk to their old location after school and buy a slice or two a la carte (they do that for lunch for such a reasonable price!) and throw away so many quarters on the Bubble Bobble arcade game.  They're really a crowd pleaser, everyone I know from the Valley like myself loves them and makes a point to order them above all other pizza joints. I really don't stoop to eating \"junk\" food very often, so when I do, I want to make sure I get the very best. Barros has always hit the spot for me, and was a huge part of my childhood."}
{"text":"I love Barro's, but something is up with this location. We ordered delivery a couple weeks back and it arrived cold and unbelievably greasy. We live less than two miles from the location, it should have been hot.  We decided to give it another shot, and tried calling in a take out order. The phone rang and rang and rang and rang and rang and rang... nobody picked up. They're open, or so says the website.  Really disappointed. Barro's is my favorite local pizza chain. Unfortunately, something's just up with this location."}
{"text":"Food came out quickly and customer service was nice. I was going to dine in but decided to make it a carry out at last minute. No complaint here."}
{"text":"They have some great pizza and it's perfect for pick up or dine in. The crust is a little thicker and full of flavor... the wings are great too.   Call in ahead of time and it'll be ready 20-30 minutes later."}
{"text":"Service was good, pizza arrived to the table in a reasonable amount of time considering they were busy. The pizza on the other hand (medium special) was extremely soggy. Disappointing and will probably not return."}
{"text":"Order a pie and wings last night they said pick it up in 30 min, i git there about 25 min later  paid and the girl said we will call  you when it is ready, i took a seat and waited.  About 20 min later i went back up to the register and i   ask if its ready yet. Well it was.  It was sitting in the back  with a bunck of other peoples orders  getting cold while  we all sat there waiting.  They gave me my order and starting passing out the other peoples orders who were waiting for them.  I will not be back.  I could have gone  to little ceasers  and finished eating befor i even got my food here.  And the quality is about the same.   Pizza here very doughy.     Wings were good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"For a great lunch deal and pretty good salad bar we enjoy the food. I think the lunch special is the best thing going for them! Great price"}
{"text":"I used to order here a lot.  Usually they get 80% of my order correct either forgetting a 2 liter or extra sauce etc. Just paid $50.00 for 2 pizzas and 2 dozen wings, one boneless.  The \"extra crispy\" bone in I ordered are barely cooked. Not sure how you confuse that.  The boneless were just crumbs, paid for a dozen and maybe got 4 or 5 which are stale anyway. I was going to have them cater a large party for me in the next 2 weeks however they just lost my business with their incompetence. The 2 stars are for the pizza but they barely deserve that."}
{"text":"We decided late tonight to get pizza. We settled on Barro's Pizza. Two pizzas. Anti pasto salads and mozzarella sticks later, we decided that the BBQ chicken pizza was the winner. The soda machine was out of Dr. Pepper and informing the staff to rectify the situation took nearly five minutes. The anti pasto salads were served sans cold cuts, which arrived as garden salads. After informing the cashier, she arrived at our table soon after with the cold cuts, finally completing our anti pasto salad experience. I was disappointed by the excessive onions and slightly sour balsamic vinaigrette which were overpowering.  If you like BBQ Chicken pizza with jalapeños, this is THE place. The rest was very average."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to try barros at least once in their lifetime! Awesome pizza and flavor. been loving it for over 20 years since I've taken my first bite!"}
{"text":"I am beyond disappointed in the professionalism of this place . I ordered delivery and right after I got the pizza delivered I started to get inappropriate text messages from the delivery person . I found out it was that individual due to caller id and called barrows asking if that individual worked there . They stated yes . So if you want creepy text messages order delivery from this place ."}
{"text":"All cheese, no sauce. Yuck. Very salty, which is disgusting to me. Also, the staff isn't that great, no wifi, and shit wings.   It coulda been feta."}
{"text":"we have just moved here recently and this is the best pizza at great prices and their wings are absolutely delicious.  they are quick in delivery and also for carry out.  sooo good.  we have never been disappointed with the food.  being from illinois, we love the chicago style pizza.  i recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Iam revising my review. Over the past 2 weeks I have had 2 very good consistent think crust pizza. Both times the young lady on the phone has been very pleasant. Its great to see you guys are back on track. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I went to Barro's for a small Italian sausage pizza to go. The staff was very pleasant and efficient.  I ordered over the counter.  I really didn't have to wait very long.  When I got home, I opened the box to find a pizza full of cheese, and large chunks of meat. The pizza was hot, and flavorful. The deep dish crust was crisp, and buttery.  Over all, a nice experience. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have you noticed that a few years ago, when you wanted a thin-crust pizza they were nowhere to be found, but now thin crust is everywhere so you have to hunt for the thick crust?  Well, if you want a traditional thick-crust, Barro's is a good place to get it.  We've been there twice and the pizza is just as we remembered it from before all the artisanal pizzas showed up.  The sausage is great.  So is the crust.  You can't go wrong with a pepperoni.  Unfortunately, our tastes have broadened a bit over the years, so now I look at the toppings list and wonder, where is the artichoke?  the gorgonzola?  the carmelized onions? the walnuts? the arugula? the melon? the capers? the coconut? the mandarin oranges?    Barro's is a great place to go after the movie, for nostalgia, but with Crust, Cove Trattoria, and Humble Pie all in the neighborhood, and not really caring whether my crust is thick or thin, it won't usually be my first choice."}
{"text":"Barro's is our go to date night place when we go out with other couples.  Great Pizza no matter what you choose, and the \"Honey Hot Bone-In\" chicken wings are lights out good.  Not to mention they have a glassed of area with toys and children size tables and chairs for families.  Service is consistently good and we always have a good time."}
{"text":"Ordered an extra large pizza the other night to watch the finale of the bachelor and figured out that you can split the pizza into four different types of flavors!  I've also been requesting light cheese all over the whole pizza which makes it less greasy. They quote their times accurately for when the pizza will be ready and are quick to answer the phone. Will always be my favorite pizza place, forever!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Litchfield Park and ordered from Barro's the night we moved in to feed our crew.  I was immediately impressed by the prices and the customer service, and quickly wowed by the pizza that followed!  I am more of a thin crust pizza gal but I throughly enjoyed trying out a new style and it didn't disappoint.    We have since ordered take out 2 more times and every time we've been delighted with our meal. Their hot wings are good as are the breadsticks with ranch.  Actually those are more than good.  YUM!  So glad we found a new pizza place SO close to our new home."}
{"text":"Good food but man takes forever to get a order in by phone how does a pizza place only have one line come on man more lines means more business. I like the thin crust pizza with meatballs and wings are good too as well as the anti pasta salad is good also. Only reason for the two stars is they need more lines for phone orders."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best pizza AND the best sub sandwiches! Sometimes I'll have them make me a club sandwich and only toast one half of it so I can eat the cold half the following day for lunch  BTW Kim is the nicest server/worker/helper/hostess ever! She always has a smile on her face and just like the classic tv show \"Cheers\" she'll remember your name! Big thanks to her and her co-workers! You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"We haven't dined in before, mostly just delivery or pick up but we love the Hot Wing pizza! It has the perfect amount of toppings and just taste delicious! The wings have always been pretty good too. Great place for pizza, wings and subs."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! This is my go to pizza place since moving to this area. I love how they have spaghetti and several other things on the menu other than pizza. The breadsticks with cheese are delicious!! I order ahead and my food is ready when they say it will be."}
{"text":"Loove the lunch menu! Inexpensive and filling. Cheaper than most fast food places with a home flavor. I love when I get to have lunch here"}
{"text":"I love the taste of their pizza. It's a nice change from the traditional pizza hut, domino's, and papa john's flavors. They also deliver and have a pretty good lunch special if you're in a hurry and want something different."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this place. Their pizza is probably one of the best I've had in Arizona. the wings and the pizza are always very consistent, never short on the sauce, and plenty of seating. My entire family came with me, it was their first time, let's just say we all had food coma afterwards. happy 1st timers for sure!"}
{"text":"The counter people are great. The pizza is awesome.  But the owner/manager needs to run the business better.  They open at 10:30 and always have a crowd of people pretty much instantly.  And yet they refuse to cook more than 1 of each type of pizza at a time.  News flash..  if you ALWAYS have a crowd, and the pizzas are gone within 3 minutes, you should be cooking 3 times as many.  They aren't going to get cold !!!!! I've been waiting 15 minutes, now my lunch almost over! Get with the program Barros!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, the manager, not so much. I've been ordering for delivery for over two years at our new house, and one day the manager says its out of the delivery area.  I asked to speak with the manager and he noted that we resent my ordered form them, but that it wasn't happening tonight. I'm not one to get mad, but I will not be using this location anymore! No matter what! Please be consistent and polite"}
{"text":"I normally love eating at these places but today having dinner with the family & having to wait an hour & a half for pizza & wings that we don't have yet is a bit much! This location is not great at all!! The young girls working here have MAJOR attitude & are not helpful at ALL! I would think they would like to be more helpful but anytime you ask something they give you attitude & roll there eyes at you. I'm not happy right now & neither is the rest of my family. So much for enjoying dinner with them. #notfeelingbarrosongilbertinmesa#"}
{"text":"I love this location! I order from here often and will get 2 large 1 topping. OMG! My pizza is Always super cheesy and so tasty. The customer service is great. I'm a ninja turtle at heart and this location has me stuck."}
{"text":"My husband has been thinking of pizza all day, but also needed his hot wing fix and so we decided on Barro's. We looked on their website first to see if there were any specials and chose an XL pepperoni and 24 traditional wings. I called in our order for delivery and was helped by a girl on the phone who was friendly, but made me feel so rushed. She sounded almost impatient. After paying we were told it would be about 40 Minutes, but came a little bit faster than that. The pizza looked awesome and actually fed my entire family of 6 and 4 are boys lol. Cheese was melted perfectly and the crust wasn't too hard or too soft. The wings were HUGE! We ordered them hot and that they were. They were a bit over sauced in my opinion, but still very good. Prices were a bit much at $38 before we even tipped. As a special I'd think it may have been a better deal. I'd definitely order from here more or eat in, but not as often as I would if the prices were a bit more family friendly."}
{"text":"I've had Barro's before and the choices are ok and the pizza decent, but not spectacular. This was my first time at this location and I came with a few others.The pizza tasted okay, but wasn't cooked perfectly and the rest of the food wasn't overly memorable. The service, however, was terrible and the main reason for the 2 stars. The dining room had clearly not been vacuumed lately. The girls taking orders seemed in another world and there was a distinct lack of communication between everyone. They had to go back multiple times to confirm an order when there were barely 10 people in the place. We had to ask for silverware and they seemed put out when we asked. As we were there, a guy from the back brought heaping garbage cans through the restaurant. As far as I know, that's not sanitary. Also, the kids working had friends come in and start to socialize. There was definitely no adult on hand to monitor the situation.   I'll be sticking with Spinatos or Oreganos for my quick pizza fix from now on. Better pizza and better service."}
{"text":"This was my first time order from Barro's and I must say that I was very pleased with the delivery service. It's the best pizza I've had in a long time and best I've had since moving out here to Arizona 7 years ago from Oakland,CA. Order was delivered in the time frame they promised and delivery person was friendly. I think I'll be using them plenty during this upcoming football season."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite places to eat! as a fan of wings and gluten free pizza, it's a weekly occurrence. I love the wings, big, fresh, and saucy! I have been to six different locations and they never fail to impress on any scale. great staffs, fresh food, fast service, awesome salad bar, I could probably live there!!"}
{"text":"Barro's has been my favorite pizza place for quite some time now and over and over again I have been impressed with the quality of their pizza and how affordably cheap it is.   Every day of the week they have a certain kind of pizza they serve by slice and you can only get that kind of pizza on that day unless you order a whole pizza. (I personally suggest going there in Wednesday and getting their hot wing pizza!!)   My workplace is close to this location and my coworkers and I frequent this location often because of their excellent pizza and really affordable price!!"}
{"text":"My companies and me personally love the service of Barro's pizza and the quality of their product! Amazing!"}
{"text":"$4.00 for a lunch special in Tempe is pretty good, if you ask me.  If you're eating two slices of pepperoni pizza for lunch, I don't think you can complain that your pizza is \"greasy.\"  (That's what they invented napkins and dabbing for.  Actually, napkins were probably invented for wiping your face, but they can be used for soaking up grease from pizza too.)    I don't know that I'll go out of my way for this one, but I won't complain about it either.  If I could give 3 and a half stars I would, so I'll be generous and round up (Barro's, if you're reading this and see my generosity, feel free to return in kind with free lunches for life.  I think that's a fair trade.)"}
{"text":"We are from the Midwest visiting family and ordered this pizza. Everyone was very pleased with the pizza. Had it delivered and even though it was a busy night for them it showed up in good time and was hot!  Thanks for doing the cooking for us Barro's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Barro's Pizza. We'd never ordered from them before, but looked at their menu and thought their sandwiches looked pretty good. We called to order and everything went smooth. I ordered, 2 HOT Italian sandwiches with a dzn Wings! Simple order, how could you screw that up?  We made this order at 11:40 am on Saturday. We were told it would be an hour! No problem, they're covering their ass! I get it! Yet it took 1:20 mins to have it delivered. The sandwiches were actually pretty good, as were the wings. We'd have enjoyed them much more if our food were HOT, like we ordered it. I understand being busy! But 1:20 mins for 2 sandwiches and wings? What's sad is, I live less than 2 miles from Barro's pizza location. You'd think the food would stay hot for that distance, huh?   I may give them another chance as everybody has a bad day. But I must say it wasn't a great first impression!"}
{"text":"We have been getting pizza and wings from you for 15 years.  We understand that prices will go up a little over time, but in less time than we have been ordering from you, your Barro's Special has gone up from $19.99 to $28.99, which is really overpriced.  Also, don't even bother putting a few pieces of soggy celery loose in a brown paper bag along with the ranch dressing.  We would rather you not put it in at all.  It looks disgusting every time.  Then, you put the bag on top of a hot pizza box, and the bag gets soggy, and sometimes it splits open at the bottom.  Your wings are pretty consistently good, and used to be the same with your pizza, but it seems like something has changed.  Last night, there was hardly any sauce on it, and some pieces didn't have any cheese, and the crust was tough."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick affordable lunch. Clean salad bar. Everything is fresh and there is a good assortment of salad fixings. I left full and satisfied. The cashier was nice too."}
{"text":"not too fond of it.. sorry"}
{"text":"We gave this location a couple more shots, hoping our previous experience was a fluke. Unfortunately we've been continuously disappointed. We've since ordered delivery and pickup, and every time we've had it from this location the food has been mediocre at best.   We're incredibly happy with the 40th street and Greenway location and have been traveling the extra distance to go there instead."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Barros location.   This one's a little closer to our house in Chandler compared to the Tempe Warner and Kyrene location (better quality end product), and we decided to do take out one evening.   The only reason I left the third star?   Everyone on the phone and at the store was pleasant, and delivered great customer service.   Our order, though? Not so great.   The toppings and crust of our pizza was absolutely torched.   The Fire wings were super fatty. I realize wings are fatty by nature, but these weren't the kind we've come to expect from Barros.   Also, check the sign on their door I've added for this business. Good thing we showed up before 8, yeah?   Will stick to the Warner and Kyrene Barros from here on out, unless I'm having an exceptionally lazy, \"Don't want to drive that far!\" kind of night."}
{"text":"The wings are huge, the pizza is delicious, what more do you want or need to know about Barros?   Oh right, yes: This is a pizza joint. Don't venture off into the deep end beyond PIZZA and WINGS.  It's not the best pizza you will ever indulge in; however, there's a reason this place has been around for ev er: It's affordable and tasty.   Fire wings are true to their name. Barros Special is a fantastic combo, but we usually try to stick to 3-4 toppings.   And the customer service is great.   It should be known that I haven't dined in or even picked up at this location.   Just called in orders for that random Friday night Dude y yo are planning to binge watch Netflix and NOT lift a finger to cook! Always polite over the phone and never on infinite hold.  Bottom line, Barros is always a safe bet for take out pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, even with delivery. Their cheese, sauce and bread are rich and flavorful."}
{"text":"Solid delivery pizza. Our go to for delivery. We've tried the others, barros is your best option for delivered pizza, hands down."}
{"text":"Barro's is my family's go to pizza shop. Pizza is always good and other things like chicken wings are also good. I don't recommend the single slice pizza as it is usually not fresh, but everything else is really good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  The crust is perfect.  Salad super good. Sawyer McGrath very nice employee.  I will come here often."}
{"text":"Embarrassingly I have been here probably close to 100 times. At least 20 of the 30 lbs I need to lose is from Barro's. My wife and staff tell me I need to stay away.  I can't. The all meat pizza and huge dining area are as irresistible as a cute puppy with a red Christmas bow around it.   The price is great. Too good- which is probably why they just raised it a bit. Still a smokin' deal!   Police officers often congregate to eat here. Seriously. All of them. Like at least 50 at a time. I've never felt more safe and satisfied in my life. If you are a wanted criminal, come buy them a round of pizza, confess your crimes and I'll bet they let you off easy."}
{"text":"We've loved ordering from this Barro's location for a while now, but today was absolutely disgusting. Nearly $40 for two tiny (supposedly medium) pizzas and they are nothing but grease with terrible flavoring. There is so much grease that it was soaked through both boxes before we even got them in the house and made the pizzas soggy. The chicken on the hot wing pizza doesn't taste fresh, and I couldn't even swallow a bite of the other pizza because it was so salty. My fiancée, who (like any man) will eat anything, said it was the worst pizza he's ever eaten. So disappointing. :("}
{"text":"EH... We usually drive up to our fav Streets of New York but thought we would give Barros a try since we live down here in Laveen.  First impression, nice interior, lots of tvs although I feel bad for anyone that hasnt been here before and doesnt know to order before you sit.   Secondly, why is there a tip line on the credit card slip?  How do I know what to tip before I receive any service.  But it makes some sense because you dont actually receive service, you get a number so you mostly feel pressured to leave something.  Not sure where it goes since again, no one actually serves you.  The young girl that brought us our pizza seemed like she had more important things to do.  I think we got a \"here ya go\" as she slid it onto our table.  Prior to that though, the side salad we ordered had wilted lettuce in it.  Garden salad that had lettuce, tomatoes and croutons...wheres the rest of the garden??  Pizza was really good though.  But I doubt we will be going again. Back to Streets for us."}
{"text":"Good pizza and decent service. One star off for lack of toppings options.  If they added feta cheese i would probably go more often.  One star off also for charging extra for dipping sauces"}
{"text":"I didn't believe in God until he put a Barro's Pizza near my home.  In fact I thought he was in with the Devil just to torture me with the crappy pizza we have!  So now I pray every night and thank my lucky stars that I can have Barro's pizza delivered to my home at any given time....so I have to support them as much as possible.  That wont be hard since the pizza is so good and such a good value, you can stop in for the lunch specials which I normally pick up either 2 slices and a drink for $4 or a slice, drink, & salad bar for $4.25!  Ar you kidding?  Such a good price for such good food, I dare you to go across the way to 1 Brothers Pizza....you too will be thanking the Barro Pizza Gods!"}
{"text":"I have always loved borrows pizza, it's the best!  However, this place needs to address the sewage odor inside.  I came here the other day and it grossed me out.  I know that it is an older location and can remember going here when I was in High School for lunch.  Please, please, please address the odor!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza delivery/take-out place. We love the original crust pizza and will either get the all meat or half extra cheese/pepperoni option. They are always willing to help me make the pizza my own. I really love their boneless wings, but my family enjoys the bone-in better. I like to pick-up my pizza so I can make my own salad from the salad bar. Dining in is also fun. The pizza tastes great. Everything Is fresh and delicious. If we dine in, I always get my own thin crust veggie. Employees are nice. Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm actually quite shocked at some of the poor reviews on here. Barro's has been my go-to for pizza comfort food for years. The new locations are beautifully upgraded & conveniently located around the valley. The veggie pizza is superb - never lacking in toppings & their ranch dressing is literally my favorite of all time. Also, you can't beat their lunch specials. The staff is always friendly & if there will be a delay, they set my expectations up front. Great for large gatherings or an easy date night."}
{"text":"So much cheesieness!!  Always hot and fresh whether you pick it up or you have it delivered.   I live pretty close so I usually pick it up. They have a very clean location and a fresh looking salad area. The staff is always right in front to greet you with a big smile.  You can see the kitchen and the cooks, which I always appreciate.  Although there is no bar service you can grab a glass of wine or a beer. They do have a very large dining area so bring the whole gang! Two large flat screen TV's hung high! See you there!   Great great pizza! (also look online for coupons)"}
{"text":"We love Barros and this location is closest to us. We always get good service and tasty food. The only issue I have is that when I get a coupon for $5 off, it doesn't apply to the \"family special\". So although the coupon does save us some money, I feel that strategy is deceiving. The net savings ends up being like what, $2 after they hike up the price of the same items in the family special. Either send me a coupon for $5 off, or don't. But don't restrict my order"}
{"text":"Literally just had an experience so bad I had to leave this review immediately. I'm actually disappointed, Barro's used to be my favorite pizza place, but now I'm most likely never ordering from there again. I ordered a thin crust pizza (which I have before so I knew what to expect) and it shows up literally so thin it won't even hold the pizza up. All I got was pepperoni and jalapeño ! It was soggy and under cooked. Absolutely terrible. It was completely inedible. Actual slop. Also ordered breadsticks with cheese, is it just me or do only the middle 2-4 sticks have cheese. The rest is burnt bread. All I'm saying is QUALITY CHECK."}
{"text":"Favorite local pizza place. The toppings are always so fresh. It's quick and delicious.  I also love the salad bar options!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is some of the best pizza I've had in my LIFE.  The crust is puffy and chewy around the entire perimeter...it thins out right under the pizza allowing you to not fill up entirely on crust!   They also have the best hot wings in town...it's all in the sauce...and I'm crazy about it.  They serve these wings in a bowl and it generally comes with a decent amount of extra sauce at the bottom for a spicer wing.  We've requested our wings \"swimming\" before and boy were they!  Actually I have to be honest...that time \"swimming\" was a little too much sauce.   This is a special treat for me.  Give me a small pizza to share, an order of wings, and two 1/2 pitchers of beer (cause you can't order a full pitcher WTF?!?)...I'm set!   Seriously...my mouth waters every time I talk or in this case write about Barro's.    One thing to mention...this is NOT a nice place at all.  It's pretty dumpy, but fun on a Saturday or Sunday when you aren't looking for any glitz or glam."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the place is a complete disaster. We keep coming back because the food is SO good but now we resort to take out because the experience is SO awful. Today my husband and I are running errands in the area and stopped in for lunch, over 3/4 of the tables were dirty with plates stacked and crumbs all over the tables. We and many other patrons had to clean our own tables off.   Absolutely ridiculous.   Long story short, I'm a fan of the food but every time we dine in, we are disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza for the money. Always enjoy the pizza here. Way better then the normal pizza chains. Wish I had tried them sooner."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Great food and excellent service.  Had a large catering order and they totally nailed it!"}
{"text":"Came in today and was sad to see that there was seemingly only one employee working both the counter and dining area. All the tables were dirty, napkins and straws were all empty, and the poor girl was overwhelmed. I give her a lot of credit for remaining friendly and engaging despite being overwhelmed."}
{"text":"We just wanted a \"normal\" pizza dinner last night and this was right across the street. The Chicago-style pizza, garlic bread and garlic Parmesan wings were awesome, and it had to be our cheapest meal in Scottsdale. It was significantly better than expectations based on the Yelp rating. The only think I didn't like was ordering and paying at the counter and then sitting. I would have preferred a server experience. But I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying..... when the place first opened... My family couldn't get enough of Barros..... The food was great... However, it seems as though their food  service and customer service has declined drastically.....  Due to the decline in service, we hadn't ordered from them in a while.... I decided to give them another try..... So I placed a order for delivery.... At exactly 7:15pm and I didn't get my food till 8:34pm....  I even called them at 7:50pm to make sure they still had my order.... The girl wasn't rude.. But she wasnt courtesy  & pleasant either.... I asked if they had my order and when would it be out for delivery..... I gave her my info... She pulls up the order and says \" we have it... it'll be another 30mins before it's ready\" and click she just hangs up.... So I'm like ohhhhhkay....?!?!? The food finally arrives at 8:34pm.... It's cold as ice.... And dry.... I could tell the pizza and wings had just been sitting out... It was stale, old, and cold.... The chicken wings were dry.... I only ordered 2 items.... A small pizza and six wings.... That's it.... And It took way over an hour to get me two items....  I believe I'm going to have to leave Barros alone.... I can't deal with stale, cold  food....  Also, I Posted a picture of the receipt and you can see the order time and delivery time.... And the two items I ordered.... I hope things get better with Barros bc I really liked their food...."}
{"text":"Love the customer service. Manager was Excellent and on top of everything. Counter girl was friendly. Surprisingly no tip jars at registers, paid cash so not sure how to tip."}
{"text":"The service was great, the pizza was yummy and the restaurant was very clean. I would recommend this pizza to everyone. The prices were good and they provided great customer service."}
{"text":"****Updated from a visit in Jan 2014: I love you, Barros. I was craving pizza and a beer last Friday so my boyfriend had a nice local night out. Your pizza was hot, the salad cold, the beer cold and all were super fresh. It fixed my craving but I have to admit that I am still craving more! Again, my only complaint is that the restaurant wasn't especially clean, but again it was Friday night after a rush. Fix that & I'll give you the 5 stars!****  I've been wanting to check out Barro's ever since it opened in Laveen a couple of months ago. Finally got the chance last Friday and although it wasn't what I expected, I enjoyed it.   Guess I expected Barro's to have an actual bar area, with high tops to sit at. What I found was a large open space with tables and booths, and a children's play area in the back corner, and TVs around the restaurant with different sporting games on. The restaurant wasn't clean, but it was Friday night after a rush, so I don't want to discount them for that. The bathroom was clean and properly stocked.   We ordered one large Barro's special pizza with a side salad, breadsticks and a pitcher of beer. Our total was $32 and the amount of food we got was more than enough for the two of us! The salad was fresh, and the pizza was hot and the ingredients flavorful. It was a fantastic deal!   We will definitely be back. Nice to have more restaurants than major chains in the SoPho area!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! It's as simple as that! Never had a problem with delivery and the pizza is consistent in quality. Just a note: if you order a veggie pizza, don't get the tomatoes it will make the crust extremely soggy! Like literally, water at the bottom of the box..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Their crust is phenomenal!  The outside is nice and crispy and the inside is soft and fluffy. We always have the black olive, tomato, and chicken pizza. The barbeque chicken pizza is also wonderful.   The only thing they need to improve is to learn to cut the cores out of the center of the tomato."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Barros for at least 10 years. Our orders are on time and the pizza is the best. Their salad does need some sprucing up."}
{"text":"Food is ok delivery is the worst it always always cold this time it took an hour and 15 minutes cold mozzarella sticks soggy sandwich every time I order it comes cold when I call and say something they just refund my money I don't want free food I just want hot food it's a joke it's ridiculous I guess they're such a big sandwich shop now pizza place they don't care A bunch of young kids working this time the manager didn't even get on the phone I guess he knew my food was cold I just told the young girl to give me my money back I mean how busy could they be I ordered it at 6 o'clock on a Sunday night"}
{"text":"Got take out order while on Spring Break.  3 pizzas, all awesome.  Liked the thicker crust better than thin.  Go with the sausage and pepperoni and you won't be disappointed.  Looked like a cool place too."}
{"text":"I went with a couple girlfriends to watch the PAC-12 championship game. The food was good but the pizza wasn't crisp. The service was NOT good. They confused our order and then didn't believe we ordered garlic bread. Then they forgot our second pizza. We had to ask for silverware and parm cheese. There was clearly no manager on duty as the employees were loud and yelling in the dining room/flirting with each other. Then while we were eating, they brought two overflowing trash cans from the kitchen through the dining room and some of the trash fell on the floor. Gross! I will only get take out from this place from now on."}
{"text":"Staying at the Zona Resort and ordered a large pizza with cheese and pepperoni, 12 medium wings, 12 BBQ wings and two veggie salads! Everyone enjoyed all the food and said it was spot on. However, one tad bit (15 minutes) late delivery gets this place down to 4 solid stars.   The crust on the pizza was to all of our satisfaction - not too thin, not too thick. Sauce was right in the middle between sour and sweet - could have been sweeter with a bit more oregano flavor for this Sicilian, but overall - for a pizza place that delivers on a Sunday - it was really good."}
{"text":"Another good pizza find in Phoenix. A nice, thicker crust, lots of sauce, and crispy pepperoni. We ordered this in to our hotel room and had a perfect, air-conditioned evening in."}
{"text":"Yesterday was Halloween and we order from Barro's all the time. I called at 5:00 and they said the pizza would be ready in 40 minutes.  I knew they would be busy and I had a bunch of hungry kids waiting for food so I ordered early.  When I got there it was a nighmare and my pizzas didn't come out for another 45 minutes.  They really didn't give a crap about all the pissed off customers.  The good thing with Pizza is way have a lot of options.  I will go to Rays for now on and the pizza is better anyway"}
{"text":"I expected to be really impressed from reading the reviews.  However, I didn't find anything outstanding or special about the place.  It was pricey for a pizza joint.  A large salad was $7.  The tables were dirty.  Which I found sort of odd considering they cleared off the plates, but they didn't wipe down the tables.  I ended up getting napkins and doing it myself.  I'll go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"So, we've ordered from  them a few times since the last visit and everything has been great! Our delivery has arrived beautifully   and delicious as always"}
{"text":"I had visitors in town and we decided to give this new pizza joint a try. We came in at 1 pm. The dining area had only two other guests. We ordered at 1:10 and received two gluten free pizzas at 2:02. It was anything but enjoyable trying to have a nice conversation with my guests while our 4 year olds were getting hungrier by the moment. I can eat gluten so just ordered two individual slices which they handed me straight away but they sat there for 52 minutes while I waited for the rest of the tables food to arrive. There was no apology or explanation. I asked about 30 minutes into it if the food would be coming out soon but she said she would check and never came back.  It would have been some consollation if the gluten free pizza didn't resememble cardboard with toppings. I was embarrassed and felt bad that they left hungry."}
{"text":"I order regularly from Barros and have never been disappointed. I enjoy their pizza and wings more than any other local pizza joint."}
{"text":"We order pizza with topping of banana pepper from here yesterday. The pepper were not fully ripe and made the pizza taste very bitter. We ended up taking all the banana pepper out of the pizza. Very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"We used to get pizza from the old location and other locations frequently. Typically this us a favorite among the family. However, the pizza from this location lacks the flavor received at other locations. Maybe it was the lack of sauce or the crazy amount of toppings but it wasn't good at all. The staff was friendly but maybe they need help with the actual pizza making. It just tasted like grease on bread... YUCK"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Barro's all over the valley for years.  I have always liked the meatball subs.   I moved to the north side and visited (for the last time) the Greyhawk location.  After ordering a half sandwich and getting my sub I opened it to find \"1\" meatball on it.  Yes that's right,  1.  After saying \"WTF\" out loud,  I asked if there was some mistake on why my sandwich only had enough meat to cover 1/3 of the bread.  They said \"no, that's what it is supposed to have\".  So I asked if I would have ordered a full sandwich would I have got \"2\" meatballs?  They said yes.  Are you kidding me?  Really?! This is about 1/4th of what you get at most  Barro's.  The meatballs on my sandwich were about 1 1/4\" diameter.  A full sandwich is over 14\" long. If the owner thinks this is a way to save money, it's crazy.  I will never go back and I live a few blocks away.  So if you want a sandwich that's bread and a bit of sauce with a small \"meatball surprise\"  hidden in one end,  this is your kinda place!   That's the fastest way to go out of business. Give the customers much less for the same price!   Sad.  What a joke."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a borrows in about five years. Walked into this location wanting to take out some wings and a slice of pizza. Unfortunately they only do slices from 11 AM to 3 PM for your lunch special. The staff was very nice I ended up getting a dozen wings and a garlic bread which all look very good. All and all for being a walk-in it only took about 7 to 9 minutes."}
{"text":"Good Spot. They have a big party room great for a sports team pizza party. Good Gluten Free pizza, get it as a meat lovers, minus the meat balls for a gluten free version. Their staff is pretty friendly. Good family spot."}
{"text":"Great food and good management. Good place for the family.  Good gluten free pizza. They do need a gluten free alcohol option, like a hard cider."}
{"text":"Good pizza by the slice. Service could be better.  Walked in today. All empty tables were dirty. When I asked someone to clean them. She acted like I was  asking her to drink bleach"}
{"text":"The new location of this Barro's (in the Lowes parking lot off Queen Creek Rd and Higley) was really well done.  The dining area is really nice with many more tables.  I had the lunch special two slices and a drink. I am only rating 3 stars because I feel like they can serve hotter food.  My food was barely warm and was sitting in a little case for who knows how long.   I have experienced the from this restaurant before, many times actually, and it was really good, hot and fresh.  I know they could do that at lunch somehow."}
{"text":"I love this place been going here since i was a little kid. not this location but barros. Anyway, I really love their pizza boat. however, it's the little things that really matter and this time not only was the guy on the phone abrupt and slightly rude but they forgot my stinking pizza sauce to dip my pizza boat in. It was literally the only reason I ordered. Also, i'm about a half a mile from the store and I have no idea why I would take an hour for delivery. Still love barros and will always go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken supreme thin crust and it was okay. It didn't really look like thin crust and it was kind of soggy. They do put a lot of topping on it, but I would have rather gotten the thin crust at dominos."}
{"text":"This location is awesome and efficient. I started ordering from the Dove Valley store since it opened, but Anthem used to deliver to me faster even though the new location is less than a mile down the road. Great service, staff, pizza, sandwiches, and ravioli!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza with speedy service. They pile a lot of toppings on your pie, and if you like a lot of crust, this is your place! The original crust itself is more on the doughy side and not super crispy. We had the special which was loaded with ham, pepperoni, onion, bell pepper, and mushroom. I've had their wings as well and they are also decent."}
{"text":"Having 3 gluten free people in the house we were thrilled to find the GF pizza at Barro's! Thank you, it is so nice to enjoy pizza with the rest of the family!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from these guys for a while now.  The pizza is good, can take some time for delivery, but, they are honest and tell you up front.  What makes me want to write is the employees.  They are all very pleasant to deal with, from the person on the phone to the delivery driver.  We are always impressed with the staff!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this location for lunch with a couple of co-workers on Thursday. We each ordered the two slice lunch special and drink for $4.00. I would have liked to see a pizza and wing lunch combo like another pizza establishment down the road.   Both of the people in my group went back to the counter because the pizza was cold. The staff was very friendly and provided a new slice recently from the oven.  The pizza itself was just okay for me. I like the thicker crust and the taste was fine, but really it didn't stand out to me anymore than a Digiorno."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about the food or service. The garlic bread with cheese tasted very bland, just like the breadsticks. Not impressed with their cheese pizza either. There was many spots on the cheese pizza that were missing the cheese. I think that this place is popular simply because it's across the street from the high school. Other than that I don't Think this place would stay in business. I came in on Friday evening around 7 PM to have dinner with some friends and family. My nephew suggested this place. I have not eight here previously and didn't know what to expect dining in.  Upon arriving with my three young children went to place my order at the counter and I waited for quite a while to be acknowledged by the young lady that takes the orders. This same thing happened when I went up to ask for a box to take some of the food home in hopes that my kids might eat it later. She blatantly ignored me and carried on a conversation with a coworker while I sit there waiting. I let her know that this is the first time I've been there and asked if there was anything she  would recommend. She did recommend the breadsticks and said they were very popular."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Barro's, but remember my neighbor used to order from there once a week minimum.  Kudos to them for getting us in there with a coupon for a free large pizza since we are new residents in the area.  The pizza was hot, fresh, and fairly quick. The only complaint I have is when ordering, I asked if they had ham or Canadian bacon. The girl didn't answer me, just said, \"They're the same.\" Well, they aren't... Canadian bacon doesn't have sugar, has less cholesterol and carbs, more protein, and is cut from a different area of the pig. Similar yes, but not the same. Anyway, we got a large \"ham or Canadian bacon\" and black olive pizza. Between the two of us, we had leftovers to take to work. Two co-workers saw it in the fridge and said, \"Barro's, that's my favorite pizza!\" Well, it's not my favorite, but it was pretty good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would walk, crawl, or roll my way to Barro's to eat the Spaghetti w/Meatballs. Excellent garlic bread, great customer service, and a very friendly staff!  Oh yes, not to mention some of the Best Pizza in AZ. Great Lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Hmm it's just so-so. The pizza tasted very good. It was piping hot and had the right amount of toppings. Butttttt there was a huge layer of grease on the top of it. And it took sooooo long. They weren't even busy.. and we had to drain each slice of pizza onto a napkin before eating which isn't all that appetizing..   The place was kinda dirty. Table stain was coming off and caused that sticky forearm feeling yuckkkk. We opted out of a dirty high chair and put my toddler just on the booth bench (which was also dirty but was atleast cleanable).   The breadsticks. Yeah, id pass on those. They were boring and overcooked. Crunchy af and cardboardy. Marinara sauce was good. Pizza TASTE was good. But idk. I'm going to try them again for sure but I have mixed feelings! Maybe next time I'll try light cheese on the pizza? Who knows."}
{"text":"Well, just about the worst \"pizza\" I have ever had including frozen. First I called for 30 minutes no answer! When I finally got through I placed my order and waited 1.5 hours. When it arrived it was a sloppy soggy mess that either the driver dropped and tried to put back together or just a rushed pile of crap. See pictures. Oh $30 for 2 large 1 topping pizzas after tax delivery and tip. Really disappointing"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza place in our area! I'm not a big fan of pizza but I like Barro's! I also love the fact that they have sandwiches, pastas, and salads along with the normal pizza, breadsticks and wings. I absolutely LOVE their antipasta salad and get at least a small everytime we order a pizza.  The only thing that kinda sucks about this place is a few times I've ordered for delivery and was quoted a \"30-40\" minute wait time, and I've waited over and hour and fifteen minutes without anyone calling to notify that my order would be late. They also don't offer any type of discount for long overdue orders. It's frustrating when they only deliver within a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"Love Barro's today was not very impressed came in at 2:40 toward the end of the lunch hour pizza was not fresh almost cold in fact which was weird because the pizza was burnt. The front counter girl was pretty rude as well not sure if I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"This is our go to for pizza and wings. They have great wings and many good flavors to choose from. They also have a great lunch specials. However note if you order only wings to go, when you pick up an order, be sure to let them know it's wings only. I just went in to pick up my order and they told me it wasn't ready. After waiting over 10 minutes I asked again only to find out it had been sitting on the shelf the entire time. A bit frustrating as I went early to make sure I was there to pick them up as soon as they were done. Reason being if they sit too long in the box, the team causes them to get soggy :( there is nothing worse than soggy chicken wings. However I will also say the wings are always a nice size, they are not skimpy on the ranch do that over charge for ranch.  They also let you order all flats or all  drummies without question.  Highly recommend. Again just make sure you are not sitting waiting on your order to be ready when it is actually ready. Borrows, please tell your girls to check the bags on the shelf when people come in for pick up--Everyone doesn't always order pizza. It was a wing only night for us!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. The pizza is good, and the hot wings are some of my favorite buffalo wings and the people are always nice."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are the best at Barro's.  They always give you a great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Pizza is good and great prices on lunch. Have ordered pizzas for parties in large quantities and they did a great job, on time as requested and order was correct. Only problem with this location is the sewer smell from the building sometimes. Went there this summer and could not even stand the smell so we had to leave."}
{"text":"Tried to check in but it said I was 6 miles away from this location??? Anyway, $1.75 lunch for a slice of pizza.  Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza last night which is rare for us because delivery has become such a let down in the last few years, but I was feeling lazy and pizza sound delicious so we ordered from Barros and I was really impressed.  There are an amazing about of toppings I couldn't believe how heavy the box was when he handed me the pizza.  My only complaint is even with the vegetarian it's a bit greasy, but that's a personal preference I prefer my pizza be fairly grease free.  The delivery guy was less then happy, he seemed nice just like he might have been having a bad night, but was nothing but polite which is all I'm really looking for.  And when calling to order it they were very pleasant as well.  Took care of everything without fuss."}
{"text":"Tables are always dirty and sticky, pizza is good but hit or miss most of the time. To much inconsistency to come back. I'd rather eat costco where I know it will be good every time. Looks like this place used to be better."}
{"text":"Worst Barrows that I have ever been to. Service sucked.  Pizza slices were smaller than any other Barrows I've been to. Me and my 10 year old son went in for lunch and he wanted a slice of cheese pizza. The counter girl said it would be out in 8 minutes. 30 minutes later I had to go up to the counter and ask what the heck my son is starving and I finished my food 20 minutes ago. Five minutes later they finally brought him his slice. I was excited about this Barrow opening up in the neighborhood but I think I won't be back. I wasn't even offered an apology."}
{"text":"I love Barron's pizza!  Great crust and hearty pizza.  They also have great wings.  I've been going to this locations since I was just a little kid.  Its always clean and the atmosphere is perfect for those wanting to watch sports while eating dinner."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this location to open and today was a truly special day! I would recommend this pizza to everyone. It really is that good! High quality ingredients and great sauce with a choice of original or thin crust, makes this pie to die for!   Tonight I brought home the Barro's Special which has pep, mush, ham, grn. peppers and onion. I added jalapenos on half for my husband. I am not a huge fan of ham but it was so good. Thin, small slices tossed evenly over my beautifully baked order. The cheese is just the right amount ( by this I mean you can still see the other toppings) and cooked to a perfect golden brown! I might add black olives next time, but seriously this thing was just the right amount of meat to veggie toppings as is.  The place is huge compared to the 67th Ave and 101 location. Salad bar looked clean and fresh. They have booths and stand alone tables. Very family friendly place. The employees are also very helpful and pleasant.  They have lots of specials going on at the restaurant and online coupons too! Lunch specials include a slice, salad and drink for 4.25!!! Wowzza! XL pizza and 24 wings for 23.99! So what are you waiting for? Go get some!! Peace!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza. I bought a large and my wife didn't like it so I had to try and finish it."}
{"text":"The large extra cheese pizza is my family favorite. Every now and then the pizza is inconsistent, the cheese won't be spread out evenly causing it to be to thick in the middle and a lot of crust. But when it's good, mmmm it's the best! And the 2liters of soda are warm:/ overall very tasty."}
{"text":"This is the only Barro's that we will order from anymore. We live in the NW valley and usually have the option between this location and the one off of the 101 @ 67th. After being disappointed several times by the inconsistency of the food from the 101 location we decided to stick with Lake Pleasant.   The pizza is always cooked perfectly and made exactly as we ordered it. The service on the phone and at the counter is 100% and we always feel welcome! Could not recommend this location enough and would definitely advise people to make the call to Lake Pleasant if they have the option!"}
{"text":"Good food, just wish they could grasp the concept of serving everyone at the same time or least within a few minutes of each other."}
{"text":"There's a lot of negative reviews, but I've had nothing but great experiences with Barro's. Always friendly on the phone, which c'mon, great customer service goes a long way. But - most importantly the pizza is great! Just a really solid pizza joint."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! We've been coming here for I think 8 years? Maybe 7? I can't remember but we love coming here for lunch for a little date and I love getting the salad and BBQ chicken! Sooo good! The girls are always so sweet and ask us how we've been. We really enjoy coming to this Barros!"}
{"text":"What what spending 47.11 and they served my grandson a kids meal with no sauce so when I asked for ranch with his meal and they charged me another 1.00 crazy asses"}
{"text":"Barros is great!! The pizza is always consistent, the service is excellent and the cheese bread, well, the cheese bread is out of this world! This particular Barros is large and rather decent inside. Located about a block from us it is a great go to for poick up or delivery. I have no complaints, I have nothing but great things to say...for fast, good quality pizza to eat in your living room while bige-watching your favorite shows...look no further :)"}
{"text":"I have to say a few things about Barro's. First of all, I had just started a new job just down the street and I had a full hour to kill for lunch, I didn't know what there was to eat in the area so I ventured out and stumbled upon Barro's.  I decided to try them out and have been hooked ever since.  I really like their lunch menu. It's the best deal in town. A large slice of pizza, a salad and a drink for under $5.  The service is great and I was really impressed!"}
{"text":"Just picked up an extra cheese pizza and their traditional wings. Everything was great. Their pizza crust is great and the wings had a lot of sauce."}
{"text":"My only guilty pizza place but it's do cheesy it gets soggy if you do delivery! Love it here grew up going"}
{"text":"I like the pizza here it is just regular pizza none of that fancy wood fired over priced burnt crust that is popular in those \"neopolitan\" places that are all over the place these days. You order at the counter and it comes out quickly. Had a huge salad big enough for 3 to share. I recommend the thin crust which is something you need to ask for otherwise you get the thick  crust which isn't bad but why eat the extra carbs. The large is more than enough for 3 to share also. Free refills on soda. This location on Indian Bend is nicer interior than the other one I went to in Tempe.   Awesome deals at lunch 2 slices and a drink for $5. In and out fast if you want."}
{"text":"Alright, where to start! I love the food it's super yummy but I have lived in this area for years and the horrible customer survice is never a suprise from here. The people in the front are a JOKE! The stand there and stare at you without cracking a smile or saying hello. It's extremly awkward to have to stand at the front until the teenage girls or boys decide to help you. They always seem super annoyed that your there and that you're \"bothering them.\" I come back every so often because I like their food but the customer service is embarrasing. Delivery always takes and hour. Seriously, I live down the road. After an hour of waiting on night the delivery man rang my doorbell handed my my pizza, never crack a smile or said hello. I didn't tip because of the long wait and the nasty attitude. I never said anything rude or did anything to get treated so poorly. He grabbed the reciept that I sign and tip on, and he whipped his head up and yelled \"NO TIP?!\" and I explained that the wait was long and my food was cold. He proceeded to roll his eyes and storm off. REALLY? I work in the healthcare field and customer service is EVERYTHING, but Barros needs a lesson or two or three on how to treat a human being. You can at least say hello when someone walks in. So disappointed and upset.."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We've been going 2-3 times a week since they opened this Queen Creek/Higley location and I don't even like pizza! Really never got what all the fuss was about til I stumbled onto this savory pie.  It's gotta be the sauce that knocks it out of the park. When we get that sauce with their terrific meatballs it's toe curling.  We both swoon.  We split a small pie with different meats and add a few juicy chicken wings with a great blue cheese dressing and we happy.  Most of the noon crowd are there for the lunch special (slices, drinks, salad) and are there daily it appears to me.  The dining room is very comfortable, much larger than the Williams Field location, with multiple TV screens running sports and news stations.   The staff are thoughtful and efficient and I have no idea how complaints below came about.  Food is killer!"}
{"text":"Can understand a price increase but when it's the special of the day it's no longer the special of the day, especially for a left over slice from the night before."}
{"text":"It must be a locals thing. We're not locals and weren't raised here, so when we bought our first takeout pizza from Barro's a few weeks ago, we couldn't wait to open up the boxes and dig right in. Still nice and hot, I grabbed my first slice and thought... Hmm... this is just OKAY.   It wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything special. I was expecting a nicely flavored sauce, a soft crust... but it was just pizza without the exclamation point. Don't get me wrong-- it wasn't bad pizza. I have only ever had bad pizza once in my life and this wasn't in that category. It just didn't have that appeal that left me salivating for another slice.  I do have to say, the location itself is huge and perfect for meeting friends and is the perfect local pizza joint for after a soccer game. I can't say it will be my last time eating at Barro's (because, pizza), but it certainly didn't have me rushing back to make it a Friday night tradition."}
{"text":"This is not pizza. It's absolutely horrible bread. I ordered a medium one topping pizza last night and I didn't see any of the topping on the pie. How does this place win awards??? put some cheese on it make the topping visible and add some sauce with flavor! Actually give it -2 stars!"}
{"text":"Good fresh ingredients.  Pizza is great if you order a full one.  Don't recommend going in late lunch for a slice.  By the slice is always a bit chewy and dry.  BUT if you order an actual pizza thats made its fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Barro's for about 15 years and not once has it disappointed. The pizza is always delicious, the service is excellent, and the delivery is quick. I have and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is the shit!! 2 slices of petezer, and a salad for like 6 bucks, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Ok so I use this Barros for delivery all the time and no issues. Tonight, different story. Driver arrives, reviews receipt/order and was professional and prompt, so I tipped him well (cash). I go inside the house, turns out I received the wrong pizza... Not even close to what I ordered so I assume it was someone else's. No big deal, mistakes happen...I called Barros and spoke to the same girl I ordered from. I wasn't upset at all, again, mistakes happen. She wasn't sure what to do so she connects me to the manager (Ed). I told him what happened and he spent more time trying to figure out what went wrong instead of just finding a way to correct the issue. He ended the call with telling me he would get me my correct pizza (no apology, by the way). SAME driver shows up 20 minutes later... Says \"hi I'm here to exchange pizzas\". Surprised that they want to take a pizza that has been in a strangers house, I get him the pizza and take mine. He says thanks, throws it in his carrier and walks away. No apology, no nothing... He was just as perky as he was when he originally delivered. I'm rarely complain about food or businesses but I felt this situation was handled incorrectly... My $30 + $6 delivery driver tip order turned into a 2 hour wait just to get my correct pizza... And it did not seem to phase this business at all. Going to rethink my next pizza order..."}
{"text":"There is a Barro's by my bf's place and we will sometimes order delivery from here when we are wanting pizza. I don't have much to say, but I love their spicy southwestern chicken pizza and their boneless hot wings. I only wish their Mesa location delivered to my area :("}
{"text":"I had dinner with my bf and his family here last night and I have to say I was pretty impressed. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever eaten in my life, but for a casual sit down pizza place, it was pretty good. The place was nice and they had a few big screens up, and a little arcade area for the kids.   We ended up getting 3 XL pizzas which was more than enough for our group of 10ish people. I tasted the buffalo chicken and meat lovers pizza, both of which were really good. I can't describe what makes it better than say dominoes or pizza hut, but Barro's knows what's up."}
{"text":"This was the first Barro's location that I tried in AZ, and even though I don't leave near it any longer, I sometimes swing through on my lunch break for a slice (or three). This stuff will definitely fill you up with it's thick crust, perfect sauce, and generous layer of cheese. I usually opt for pepperoni, but their sausage is pretty good as well. I've also had their boneless wings with medium heat, and they're not the best I've ever had but they'd rank somewhere in my top 5. At one point they switched their supplier for mozzarella sticks, which was a bit of a bummer, but otherwise I've always been happy with the experience. The only downside is that it's so good I tend to eat too much and feel like a fat, bloated bastard afterwards. Partially my fault, but partially theirs for making such a damn good pizza!"}
{"text":"Love their pizzas! The flavors are sharp and strong. They are super tasy, just the way I like my pizza.  A family favorite of ours is the Kona. When we dine in it seems to take a little long for us to get our pizza, but that could be due to the fact that they are always busy."}
{"text":"Barros is a good go to pizza when you're in doubt. For what it is, a family sports bar, it's good. The pizza is consistently delicious and the delivery is usually on time. If you're not feeling particularly adventurous Barros will do you right. Their specialty is their cheese and a lot of it."}
{"text":"Really greasy and fattening. Not even my stray cat that would eat literally anything wanted any. I actually kind of want to throw it up after eating it rather than gain 5lbs. When is it time for restaurants to have healthy food? So much to ask?"}
{"text":"Barro's is your run of the mill pizza and wings joint. What really seperates them from the pack of fast food pizza is the fact that they serve beer and wine. Well, sometimes. Sometimes they serve beer and wine and sometimes they don't feel like it. It really just depends on how the cashier is feeling.  On multiple occasions I have been told that it was \"too late\" to order beer. On one of these occasions (at 9:40pm), the customer next to me successfully ordered beer and was served by the manager. Seeing that I was upset, the cashier that told me it was \"too late\" whispered to the other cashier to not allow anymore beer transactions.  As for the food, it's what you expect from a typical pizza chain. Nice selection of toppings and specialty pizzas (I recommend the hot wing pizza). The wings also have a handful of flavors/degrees of hot and are right around average quality with plenty of sauce.  I was tempted to give this location a 2 star review just for the actions of one cashier, but that's not fair. The food is good and for the most part, the service is great. Just make sure you show up early if you plan on drinking."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from the location off of 10 and estrella. The food was excellent, it was my first time having that pizza was well worth the price. Nice to do once in a while with the coupon.  Food came in half the time they told me which was excellent."}
{"text":"Safe to say I am a fan..  I prefer it much better than Papa Johns or the like.   While I wouldn't  say it is the best pizza ever I'd easily give it 3.5 stars.  While I have never eaten inside the restaurant since we always do carry out I never have any complaints.  Service is always excellent and the food is always consistent.  Not much more I can ask for.  Plus it's pizza even if its bad it's still not too bad. . .    Wings are also pretty good.    They can get pretty busy at this location and if you want delivery wait time can be over 45min.    But I will say; Barros is above the rest when it comes to quick pizza take out."}
{"text":"I normally only go to the location on Power and the US 60 but was out and decided to stop here for a quick lunch. Only one employee was in the front and on top of that the dining area was very filthy. You'd think with the little amount of business they had they'd clean the tables but instead employees seemed to be enjoying themselves in the booth near the front. Food was great, service meh but the cleanliness really needed work!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Been coming here for about 3 yrs now and I'm not gonna stop anytime soon. The pizza and wings are always good & the girls up front are always so friendly! They have great customer & a nice atmosphere. I would recommend this place any day :)"}
{"text":"Oh, how it pains me to write this review.....  I've been going to this particular Barros on Williamsfield Rd. since it opened several years ago.  However, how times flies and how comfortable / lazy a business can get over time.    I called in my order at 6:24pm ,on a Tuesday night, and the nice young lady on the phone told me 30min for pick-up of a single item pizza.   I gave myself extra time because I didn't want to wait, given my goal was to eat this at home with my family.  I arrive 30min after my order was received and pay my $15 for a 1 topping large.    They said it was \"coming up.\"  So I wait.... and wait.... and wait.   I went up after 45min from when I phoned in my order to ask what the delay was.   Apparently, they hadn't started and was asked to wait another 10+ minutes.   Thus after 55 minutes of waiting, I finally received my single topping pizza.   During my wait, I observed they had 5-7 high school kids in front taking orders, but only 1-2 people in the back executing the orders.  which begs the question, what type of company values taking your order AND $$, over making your pizza......... BARROS. Remember, Barros set the time for my pizza to be completed.  I agreed to the time they set and showed up with my $$, as promised.  But as I found out, Barros is great (1) Taking the order,  is great at (2) Taking your money, but bites at (3) Delivering the order.   I would suggest to Barro's leadership, which there were none that I could tell that evening, to focus on the most important part of the transaction... delivery.    This is the most essential part of the transaction and critical to retaining repeat customers.  I wish I could say this was a random error, as stuff happens... However, the woman sitting next to me was even waiting longer.   She had kids waiting.... yikes!     So if you're okay with:  1. A business telling you one thing, and delivering another.  2. A Business not caring about your time, but only your money.  3. A business that delivers an average pizza pie, at best.   Then, Barros's on Williamsfield Rd. IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!    Just note, you've been warned of these issues.  However, if you do decide to go there, I suggest WAITING to pay.  Once pick-up time arrives and no pizza, ask for a discount, because at this point, you're in control.   Otherwise, the only other advice I can offer is to not waist your time or money and try another nearby pizza house that values its customers time as much as its customers money.   Farewell Barro's!"}
{"text":"This Barros is great. Never had an order messed up. They are quick and friendly. I don't like sauce on my wings, but the hubby does. They are happy to do half and half with sauce for dipping on the side."}
{"text":"Normally I love barros, but today came here for lunch with my son, and have already been waiting 27 minutes for our food. Very disappointed a medium cheese/loaded pizza is taking this long."}
{"text":"Best Pizza you could ever get! Best wings you could ever get! Best Ranch you could ever get! I have been coming to Barros Pizza for almost 10 years now since I have discovered the place! I have never been disappointed and have always had the best service! The counter girls remember my order lol! I will never have as much loyalty to any restraunt as I do Barros Pizza the place just can't be beat! And for the ones who complain the Barros is expensive, welp it ain't papa johns soooo....."}
{"text":"Coming from the West side of Phoenix, I've grown up on Barro's pizza so I absolutely love them. However, this specific store isn't super amazing like the others. It's probably just because they are new but some of the employees aren't very attentive and the first pizza we tried here was pretty weak. We gave it another try the week after and it came out SOOO much better! Delivery is fast and worth the first not so great pizza!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  1.called to order, lady who took my order spoke clearly and followed me, not someone half listening trying to multi task.  2.order arrived promptly within explained time frame 3. Large is very hefty for 2. Ordering one salad is more than enough to split-very generous. 4. Top quality ingredients, from the the meats to the crust and cheese. The salad was very fresh and even the ranch was legit - not the stuff you get at the store, but the richer, home made stuff. 5. Pizza arrived very hot, salad was perfect temp(not frozen). Pizza was on fleek.   *2nd order-- just as good, got a pic this time Cheese sticks are decent, pizza is excellent!"}
{"text":"Where els can you go for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for under 5 bucks??  This place was awesome 20 years ago when I came here for lunch in high school and  is still awesome when I bring my kids here now.  I just recently had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was better than i was expecting.  This is also the go to place if we are watching football or just chillen with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicago-style pizza and an amazing family-owned restaurant. This is a perfect place to take the family for pizza, especially kids. We have a 3-year-old son that loves to play in the play kitchen in the kids area while we wait for our food. You order at the counter but they bring everything to the table for you. We had to wait unusually long for our pizza the last time we were there but when I went to the counter to check on it, they realized they dropped the ball on our order and refunded my money. I wasn't even mad about the order, I just wanted our pizza. I greatly appreciated their integrity about it and I gave the money right back to them to put in their tip jar. We go here once a week and highly recommend it for anyone looking for amazing Chicago-style thick crust pizza. Get the Barro's Special pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered wings and cheesy garlic bread, at 740 pm tonight, and stayed extremely patient when my order still was not at my house around 940, 2 hours later!  So I called to see what was going on and the first girl I talked to said my order was not even taken.  So I call back to talk to a manager, his name was Al, who now changed the story and said that they came to my apartment called a number, which was taken down wrong.  So I have gotten two different excuses from the employees.  I used to be a avid customer of this store, but now I will forever go somewhere else. The manager also tried to yell at me so I decided to hangup. Like how can a manager of a family business be so rude."}
{"text":"I feel like a cheap whore giving a place like Barro's Pizza five stars. Shouldn't those be reserved for such esteemed places like Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco? Eh, whatev.  The pizza here is delicious, they are way inexpensive, and you get very full, very quickly. The interior of this location is kinda dingy, but clean, so I don't mind sitting on the same booth that has been there since 1986 (or whenever the place opened).  The pizza is what I'm looking for when I want a good, hearty, slice of pie.  Try the Kona, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My wife & I along with friends go here often for their lunch specials. The pizzas are always good and if we want hot slices, they will usually make a fresh pizza for us. Service is fabulous. We've also ordered pizzas to go and they have always been delicious. I recommend them to anyone in the Peoria, Sun City area."}
{"text":"Last time for this place. It has actually gotten worse. The hot wings were barely cooked. I threw them away! Who cooks there?"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Love the two large, one topping pizza special.  WAY better than the national chain pizzas."}
{"text":"This WAS my Barros location and here's what happened: I order delivery from this location about 2-3 times a week. Huge customer, huge tipper. I like to build rapport, I take care of you, you take care of me, especially when it comes to anyone delivering my food. One of the delivery guys even told me they call our house 'Juke Money' because we have 3 Nissan Jukes and tip well. So anyway, I've been loyal to these guys since they moved closer to my house about a year ago. They've been loyal to me. However, last night we dealt with the biggest a-hole on the phone when trying to order. We've never heard his voice before so he must be new. But he hung up on us, blamed it on background noise and was completely unprofessional when we called back. I know we call late but that's why I tip well. And that location knows me and expects us to call a little later. This guy wasn't having it. He was so rude to us that I've decided to break up with Barros all together. I'm now ordering from Rino D's in north Gilbert from now on and they will be my new pizza relationship. They don't deliver to souh gilbert but I've already established a good enough relationship that we are an acception sorry Barros, it's been real and I'll miss you guys and all the great drivers but your new guy messed up our relationship royally and permanently. Rino D's, let's keep this going"}
{"text":"Got Barro's delivery today. I hate when pizza has been sitting around and the bottom of the crust isn't cooked all the way through so it's basically mush. I asked the gentleman on the phone to make sure this didn't happen. Pizza guy knocked on my door less than an hour later, after two slices I was pretty happy. Now I have a box full of leftovers."}
{"text":"Found a bolt in our pizza!! Told the manager about it and they offered to credit us a free Large pizza.Then we asked if they wanted the pizza and bolt back, he told us not to worry about it that they will just go next door to Ace Hardware to get a new one. Then when we called asking for a higher manager the lady was extremely rude to us and their the ones that fed us the bolt!!!"}
{"text":"I hope Management at this place reads this! Went to pick up a to go order and could not find a single employee in the place to check me out. I could see my order on the counter so I proceeded to wait 5 mins. at the counter patiently for someone to help. After an \"additional\" 5 mins. (10 mins now) I began to look around for someone. There was a little window to the back were they make the food so I kept saying excuse me several times in hope someone would hear me. I could hear voices in the back but could not see anyone. I finally had to whistle to get the employees in the back attention. When two woman came around the corner they looked at me pissed off like how dare I get their attention in such a way. I told the lady who came out that I had been waiting a while and just wanted to pick up my order. The lady did not apologize at all, but simply completed my transaction and then gave me a smart a$$ Have A Nice Day respond!"}
{"text":"Barro's has some of the best fast/delivered pizza in the valley, and typically when I go I have a hard time not eating the entire thing myself.  The crust is actually the best part - crispy on the outside and just the right amount of soft doughyness on the inside.  The toppings are fantastic, and when you get delivery it always comes fairly quick and piping hot.  Now, even though I love the crust it does come with a warning - eating this crust is like ingesting a bag of concrete.  If I'm enjoying a Barro's pizza I know I won't be taking many restroom breaks for the next week or so, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Lately I've been on the Mary-Kate & Ashley diet... but every so often, a man needs to gorge himself on carbs. When I decide to eat with reckless abandon, Barro's Pizza is usually my very first choice on the list. Their hot wings are the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi, and the pizza is everything a thick crusted vehicle for sauce, melted cheese, and crispy pepperoni should be.  To top it off, this particular location is fairly vast in size, has all sorts of flat screens showing all sorts of sports, and the friendliest, most attentive staff I've ever encountered at a casual pizza place. Finally- an XL 1 topping pizza 24 hot wings, and 3 drinks rings up somewhere under $32. Yes. Yes. Yes. :D"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a Barro's freak, and it's tops on my list for diet cheats... I've been going to other locations for years, and realized this one is actually much closer to my house.. While the menu is the same as all others, my experience with take-out pizza and wings last Sunday was a few notches above the other locations.. simply put, the food was prepared much better than other locations I've been to... As a whole, Barro's has RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME Pizza and some of the best wings I've had outside of The Great Lakes region.."}
{"text":"We order a xlarge pizza but had no flavor ..we haved had in the past pizza from different places ..but to be honest it was to plain .."}
{"text":"I like their pizza. I like Pizza Hut as well as Dominoes. Don't care for Papa Murphy's. Barro's is at the top of my list for game day pizza.  I usually order through the app, and their timing is usually spot on for pick up.  Their pizza has just the right amount of oil that gives it that flavor I grew up with (Straw Hat, Shakey's and Round Table).  I've ordered several of their speciality pizzas just for verity, and love them all."}
{"text":"Ordered a cold sub today..they said it would take 20 mins which seemed crazy, but it's close and I was hungry..when I got there 30 mins later they had not started.. no manager addressed this and was offered no apology...waited another five to ten mins.. charged full price. What a joke...wont be returning after years of calling them my number 1 pizza spot"}
{"text":"Barros is our go to pizza place for a pie that never disappoints. We had a  large sausage and bacon/mushroom split order and they prepared it perfectly. While waiting for our pizza we also ordered mozzarella sticks with pizza sauce. They were yummy and disappeared quickly. This Barros is relatively new and moved from their location further north. It is was clean and looked like they were trying to keep it that way. The staff was friendly and efficient. (They look like they are taking their reviews seriously.)"}
{"text":"Now this pizza is yummy. Crust was just right moderately thin New York style pizza. I got 2 large pepperoni & sausage. Was only 17.99 for both and extra for the extra topping sausage. It was a busy Saturday night as they came in 30 minutes it was hot and fresh and yummy !! Just enough sauce & toppings ...I wish they had one in Los Angeles this would be my new pizza spot, since Pizza Hut is too damn greasy.."}
{"text":"Pizza was great but I have to say I'm very impressed with the professional young staff at barro's due credit to the management team and the staff. Friendly, courteous and happy. I believe the girl who helped me was named Elle, she rocked! Super nice and even asked my 3 year olds name. They were supper busy but the staff took the time to be nice. Rare in az nice Job Anthem Barro's!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. Got home with food and realized it wasn't what I had ordered, not a the largest pizza, but the large. I was not charged for the xl, though. I called to let them know, not expecting much. The manager made a medium pizza to make up the difference.  That was awesome!  Not only that, but the 2nd pizza was made exactly like the first, so everyone got more of what they wanted. Great customer service."}
{"text":"The last 3 times we tried this, after our initial time (which I can only think was a fluke of luck) our delivery arrived over 2 hours after we ordered it and it was cold, all three times! Why get delivery pizza if it would literally take less time to go to the grocery store and come home and make a pizza from scratch! Very disappointed.   To top that off, the woman who took our order on two occasions got it wrong and that is after being asked to repeat it back to her several times. She was also rude and impatient and seemed distracted. Maybe that is why she didn't hear our order the first 3 times I said it. This place just isn't worth the hassle, the wait, and the rude customer service."}
{"text":"Got my pizza delivered through Postmates. The pizza looked and tasted old, it was mostly bread. 100% not worth the money."}
{"text":"Pizza is good when ordered well done. Wings suck. The sauces are not good. I had the honeyhot wings & they lacked flavor. And the hot wing sauce was mediocre. So come for the pizza & pass on the wings. They do have pretty good ice tea."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I enjoy Barro's Pizza and I am not one to usually leave bad reviews. Unfortunately to my disappointment this specific location was a huge let down. I do not recommend dining here at all. I walked in and was greeted accordingly. I placed an order and was told I had a 15 - 20 minutes wait. However I was sitting for more than thirty minutes. What really got under my skin was a customer behind me also placed an order and their order came out way before mine. At this point I became extremely agitated. One of the employees notice me aggression and ran back to check on my order. When she came out she failed to provide me with a estimated time. I'm also not one to care about employees having a good time and chatting, but the conversation that the girls were having in the front was not very appropriate. Maybe this location is lacking management but something needs to change here."}
{"text":"Went here a week or two ago with the Family.  Glad they are in the neighborhood!  The pizza had always been too \"bready\" for my liking but the thin crust was great!  Throw in a couple local craft beer options and a little area for the 5 and 3 year old to play in and life is good!  Keep up the good work!  We'll be back soon!  UPDATE  This place is sliding fast.  Pizza was extremely greasy on our last delivery and we didn't go into the restaurant to eat because the last time we did it was like Chucky Cheese only the kids area is full of things that bang hard on the floor and all the kids were jacked up on Mountain Dew or something and the staff (nor their Parents for that matter but that's another discussion) had any sense to tell them to calm down because you're in a restaurant.  We had our 3 and 6 year old with us and not a chance would they ever be allowed to act like this even in a Chucky Cheese!  Lots of dirty tables and food debris on the floor.  And for God's sake, dim the lights a little at night!  It's like eating pizza in aisle 7 of your local grocery store it's so bright."}
{"text":"Great lunch deals Mon-Fri but other then that it's a generic pizza place. Nothing to special nor is there anything to complain about."}
{"text":"From the day they opened until November 11, 2014 this has been our favorite pizza place. We order delivery or eat in the restaurant at least 3 times a month. On 11/3 our pizza was over 20 minutes past the promised time and so cold that the cheese was stiff and the slices had to be re-cut.    On 11/11, we again ordered delivery ( I gave them a pass because 11/3 was a Monday during football season) I politely asked the person who took my order if they were very busy, when she seemed confused by the question, I explained the late pizza from the week before, she assured me they were not very busy and my order would arrive on time. An hour and 32 minutes later, my cold pizzas arrived with an apologetic driver who said \"she sent your order to the wrong area.  ON 12/13 ( I know, I'm stubborn, but I like their pizza) After waiting 2 hours for my pizzas, I called to speak to a manager. First) After hearing my complaint, he puts me on hold (Bad Move!) Second) After holding a few minutes, the phones clicks a couple times and then disconnects (really bad customer service) Third) After waiting several minutes for him to call back, I call again ( Now I'm really angry, but still somewhat civil)  His responses were, and I will quote, \"Oh, I was just about to call you back\", \"Yeah, I know this store has gotten really bad\" \" I hope you do call the corporate office to complain, something needs to be done\" \"We'll get that out to you a soon as we can\" I told him to cancel everything, by now it was almost 8 p.m., I certainly wasn't going to make my kids wait till after 9 p.m. to eat dinner.  Although I never received my order, they still charged my credit card. I called the corporate office, as I promised the manager I would. The corporate office took my complaint, promised to get back to me in \"two days at the most\". A week and a half later, Mike from corporate calls, apologizes for delay \"personal issues\", has nothing new to tell me. I tell Mike that they still have not removed the charge from my credit card, he says \"well, you can just dispute that with your card company\".   Although they may not miss my 60-100 dollars a month, I hope this true and accurate account will persuade others to order elsewhere. Very bad restaurant, corporate office is no better."}
{"text":"Go here for wings, better pizza can be had very easily.  The wings save the day here.    Unfortunately, given their posted no guns allowed sign, which truly means- \"hey bad guys- easy unarmed targets here\"- I'll never step foot in here again.  Don't take too kindly to being a sitting duck in a potential shooting gallery."}
{"text":"We've loved Barros for years. The last few times we've gotten pizza from this Barros location is has been extra soggy and very greasy. Disappointing.   Just updated this to down grade to one star. We gave Barros another try. Super soggy, dripping with grease.  We threw it away and ate Cheerios. No clue what's going on at this location."}
{"text":"Like most people, I absolutely love a good slice of pizza.  Whenever the family and I are in Surprise, Arizona, a visit to Barro's Pizza is a must!  We are in town now and ordered a few pizzas and large salad to go.  The service here is top notch and the pizza is some of the very best I have tried! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Shocking... I sent an email days ago like they asked and never had a response. They have since erased their response to my review on here. Like I said, no integrity."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time (dine in and take out) and have always had an excellent experience. The girls up front are kind and cheerful.  The pizza is hot, fresh and reliably yummy. Best of all, two of us have Celiac Disease and have eaten their gluten free pizza and never had any issues.  Today the manager told me the wife of the owner has Celiac so they take it very seriously...separate prep areas and everything. So happy to have a safe, delicious family pizza place."}
{"text":"Firts time trying out this place and it was a disspoitmend. Even a 3 year old was disspoitmend with the pepperonis on the pizza they where burn and it gave the pizza a horrible tast. Never aging going back!"}
{"text":"Love Barros Pizza. Taste better then the price you pay for it!"}
{"text":"If I could award 0 stars I would. The reason being we sat for 10 mins with our family and received no service or acknowledgment that we even came into the building at all. We sat ourselves down at 8:50 P.M Thursday December 14th and waited until 9:10 PM to take our business elsewhere. Absolute disappointment and would not recommend this location or business to anyone."}
{"text":"I think I have 50/50 curse.  That's where I only have a 50% chance of getting service and food at a competent level.  We just bought groceries yesterday. Still have 4 filet mignon in the fridge and we decide to order pizza.  Priorities right, lol.  We order from Barro's up the street as we do quite often actually.  Wings, couple pizzas, and a sandwich (wanted to see if they were any good, the sandwich that is).    I can't even get into a long winded detail as a 42 year old man I just want to cry, lol.  I seriously have the worst luck.  There cannot be anyone on this planet that has the level of horrible luck I have when it comes to any type of customer service especially in the food and serice industries.  Should have guessed something was wrong due to the bottom of the bag stooped in orange wing sauce.  It's usually spilled a bit cause their styrofoam containers for their wings are pretty flimsy but this was bad. Obvious something bad happened on the delivery route we realized after we opened the pizza boxes. The toppings, especially on my pizza, we're toppled off all to one side of the pie and stuck to the cardboard box. The cheese was set so I figure it must have been out of the oven for some time. Painfully obvious the order had toppled over en route.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I'm just so tired of getting crappy service, messed up orders, over/under cooked food, and simply the impression that nobody in the phoenix area that runs or works in a restaurant gives a crap anymore."}
{"text":"Great location to get some reasonably priced pizza. Employees are always warm and friendly and they have a variety of food options if you're not interested in pizza. Pizza can be slightly greasy but they have nice sauce and if you order sausage it has a great spice to it, very flavorful. This location can be crowded so order earlier than later."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious .. Hot wing pizza totally hit the spot.. Not overly spicy hot.. Lots of chicken.."}
{"text":"Saturday night I had pizza on the brain, and Barro's was the first place I knew I had to go eat at.  I've had Barros before, just not from this specific location.  I entered and found that it was setup like the other location I had been at, which is nice!  I went up to the counter and kept it simple with my order..small peperoni to go.  The girls at the counter took my order, and my pizza was done when they had promised!  I had to wait for only about 15 minutes, but thats not bad, and its worth every bite to have a good pizza.  Anyways, I think I finally found my new pizza home!  Any Barros really, but thier pizza is consistant from what I have found between locations.  Its a pan style pizza, and the taste is what I like! Plus, they have a small wine and beer selection, which I like as well.  :-)"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I can't BELEIVE NO one has told me about this place!  Holy cow!  I LOVE it here!  Here's how I discovered Barros.  Last night I was starving and exhausted.  I refused to cook and after looking in my fridge, decided some action needed to be taken.  So, I venture out to find a new place to eat at.  I wanted something quick, and tasty.  So, I'm driving around and see Barro's from the road.  I have heard of this place before from Yelpers, but never bothered to check the place out.  So, I figured tonight was the night.  I park the car and go inside.  I really liked what I saw upon entering.  Tables, booths, lots of folks eating and ordering, but nothing so out of control that it would be troublesome.  I saw thier menu and was pleased with the choices that they have.  They seem to have a really nice variety of stuff to choose from, and a lot of options for ala carte pizzas and pizzas that they sell as a menu selection.  They have meat lovers, chicken BBQ, and most common choices you would think of when pizza comes to mind.  I decided to go simple this time since it was me dining alone and my first time eating here.  I went with a small Pepperoni pizza, and dined in.  Even though they were busy, my wait in line was minimal (less then 5 minutes) and my wait for pizza was about 20.  Not bad for a late Friday night.  When the pizza came, it was like winning the lottery in my mouth, and to my eyes.  Finally, a GOOD freakin pizza in Phoenix.  FINALLY!  UGH, I've been waiting for this moment for 3 years.  I can finally eat good pizza again!  What also excited me was that they serve beer and wine here! I wanted a glass of wine SO bad, but passed because the menu said they only had Merlot, Chardonnay, and one other wine.  I would have ordered a glass if I was not dining by myself, but this was so cool.  Awesome for serving alcohol to make my day even better!  It was the thick crust pizza, and that excited me.  everything was so delicous!  I was in love, and still am with Barros.  I took my leftovers home, and plan on returning to enjoy thier delicous food once more and many times again."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza is awesome. I came here for dinner Saturday night and loved it.  Please was quiet, but pizza was good none the less.  The girl who took my order was friendly, even for late on a Saturday night.  Barro's pizza is the bomb, and I will be back, thats for sure."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area of Chandler. As I drove around to see what kind of restaurants I had in my area,I noticed Barros. The first time I went to eat in the restaurant, Dallas was my waitress.  It was the worst service I have ever had but the food was descent.  The second time I decided to call in my order,the young lady who answered the phone Alia I believe, put me on hold for 13 minutes,are you kidding me? I hung up the phone and ordered pizza from another establishment.  Barros has lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the valley. Hands-down, no doubt. pizza is made fresh and I have never had a bad experience with dine-in or take out. The wings are solid, salad bar is decent, and there is ABSOLUTELY NO BETTER LUNCH COMBOS VALUES AROUND. Less than $7 for a meal that will literally put you in a food coma! (3 [BIG] slices and a drink)  Not to mention, they supported a fundraiser my organization was having. I just can't say enough about how much my wife and I love this place.   Thursday are my favorite lunch combo day! Chicken Supreme for the win!!!"}
{"text":"We used to visit this Barros when they first opened, it seems it has gone down hill. We ordered a couple slices for lunch and the crust was drenched in oil and rubber like it was microwaved. It may have been the workers that were here this particular day. I believe in second chances ill try this location again if not better next trip, peace out."}
{"text":"It's all about the taste! Great pizza, fresh toppings. Young but good staff. Very friendly. Don't try the cheese sticks.. you can't stop eating them! Eat in take out if your craving pizza go here. Recommend original crust."}
{"text":"Great pizza though a little pricey for me.   Love they have a gluten free pizza though it's expensive too."}
{"text":"Great pizza and super friendly staff. I mostly take out my order but eating in the restaurant is nice. They have a small but delicious salad bar. We order the large and share while the pizza cooks. They also serve a gluten free pizza crust. The gluten free is a small pizza with very thin crust."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza and very good antipasto. I eat pizza there frequently but had delivery last night same great pizza and delivered hot."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online from their website, ordering was very easy.  Pizza arrived on time (in fact it was 2-3 mins early)  It was piping hot.  Their sauce is delicious and they do not skimp on the toppings.  I ordered pepperoni & mushrooms and was impressed with how heavy each slice was.  Generous amount of cheese also.  I got the thin crust and the toppings were spread all the way to the edges.  I'm one of those who never eats the bare crust, so I was very pleased to be able to eat the entire slice.  Dog was bummed because there were no pizza bones for him.  By far the best pizza in the hood."}
{"text":"Watch out people, stand back, there is a compliment coming. This pizza is not bad. It is not NY style pizza, the crust is way too thick and puffy for that. It is just a pizza, but the flavor of the sauce and the sweet, slightly creamy texture of the cheese, make this an okay pizza. It is better than the Streets of NY or NYPD, which try to be something they are not. I don't think Barros pretends to be anything but a pizzeria, making their own pizza. For that I applaud them as well as for the pretty good pie I had. Thanks Barros, I might be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good product, they have been in business for a long time. I want to buy from them but they have a big issue RE: Takeout customers who come to pick up their food.     They recently relocated and I had hoped they would rectify an issue that was transparent in the old location, the lack of a dedicated register or area for patrons arriving to pick up their food, they did not. They replicated the old design from the previous location which consists of a group holding area for patrons who want to place an order and patrons who have come to pick up their to go orders. There was no reason for this as they had ample floor space to accommodate a separate register with a sign over it to indicate a take out pick up area distinct from the eat in area. So, when you pick up food you have to wait in line behind others who want to order for eat in regardless of the fact you ordered 20 minutes ago and just want to pick up your food. Too bad they cannot recognize the bad service this provides to their many takeout customers."}
{"text":"Having worked at two pizza places in my lifetime... Barro's pizza is amazing! What I admire the most is their consistency. Perfect balance of sauce, cheese and topping. So much flavor and not too expensive... So worth it"}
{"text":"This place is a local chain that started out years ago in North Phoenix. Happy to see Barro's prosper. This location is now serving beer from San Tan Brewery. It's all good."}
{"text":"I grew up going to this Barro's. Granted, it is not the COOLEST looking pizza place ever, but it is by far the best. All the Barro's locations across the valley have amazing pizza!  They have lots of tables and booths; perfect for family pizza parties. They have TV's, normally with sports kicking.. and a play area for kids with a ball pit and video games.   Thick, yummy crust and flavorful cheese. I love to dunk it in the mild wing sauce!  Anyways, Barro's has the best pizza in Arizona, its is really reasonably priced and locations all over... so try them out. You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Um, WOW.   So I called in an order for pizza tonight. Then I called back to change my order. When I arrived I first found that they either misunderstood my attempt to change the order or forgot to communicate the change - no problem, they fixed it right away and it was no extra time, charge, or hassle.   As I left the store I double checked one pizza because it was a special order due to dietary restrictions (no cheese). Unfortunately, the pizza had cheese, but no sauce. I doubled checked the receipt and found that the receipt said \"No Sauce\" rather than \"No Cheese\". Big sigh, because I absolutely despise having to send food back. I told the woman at the counter and she quickly got a manager who very politely apologized and quickly offerred to remake the pizza. The pizza was remade promptly and correctly.  THEN the most AMAZING thing happened. When the pizza was ready the manager asked if I would like to take the mistake pizza home with me - sure! He also told me he gave me an extra order of breadsticks for the trouble. Um, WOW.  Here's the thing - Special orders can be tricky. With my dietary choices it isn't uncommon for restaurants to make an error or two when preparing my dishes, but it is super, super rare for a staff to go so very out of their way to ensure that the order is completed to my liking and that I am compensated for the extra hassle.   I am SO impressed by the staff and management at this restaurant!!   P.S. The pizza was delicious :)"}
{"text":"Sweet! I can now get my Barro's fix closer to home. I'm sure most of you already recognize this as THE best local pizza chain we've got in Phoenix, and the thick, flavorful crust as well as awesome toppings are delicious for lunch or dinner.   Came here for a nice lunch special...two people dining in with two slices and a small drink each came out to just a bit under $10. That's less than you'll probably spend at any of the other options in this plaza. I'd tried the special \"hot wing\" variety with chicken and buffalo sauce and it was tasty! Just make sure the pre-made pizzas aren't getting too cold. Pizza should always be a hot lunch!  There are also tons of seats here, and the place is VERY clean. I look forward to coming back. =)"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I was sick of pizza, I ended up at Barro's. I've never seen such a squadron of youngsters so friendly and helpful. When they say \"20 minutes\", my pizza's ready in 15. These kids are on the ball.  The crust? Not too thin, not too thick. Just right. Tasty. Soft. Sauce? Great! Not too thin, just the right amount, not too salty or tangy. Great cheese, generous toppings. My mouth is watering. So many specialties I have to try...I wonder about that kona pizza with terryaki sauce, chicken, and pineapple. Sounds yummy.  It's also nice that they're always doing some sort of fundraiser in there; they really enjoy giving to the community. This is not your average parlor."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hours. Boy, was that a mistake.   Unfriendly kids working front counter. They don't want to be helpful and assist customers, but while other employees are in the back corner hanging out, they can join them and go socialize.   Believe if they had someone over the age of 18 working, maybe all customers wouldn't complain either."}
{"text":"If you like an EXTREMELY CHEESY pizza barro's, this Barro's is for you. Every other one I went to always had a good portion of cheese, sauce and meats.  More than half my medium pepperoni pizza was all cheese. I felt like I was choking on the cheese.  I'm giving it 3 stars because at least the wings were good and food was discounted."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!  My new favorite Pizza place!  The wings were good but the pizza was just  the best!"}
{"text":"Consistent food that's always good, hot, and fresh. No complaints at all. Have had both dine in and delivery and all experiences have been great. Keep it up Barros!"}
{"text":"Love Barro's from the pizza to wings it's all good!! Service can be a little slow when u dine in but i just assume it's because they have a lot of orders to fill. They deliver to so it's a win, win."}
{"text":"have the buffalo chicken pizza - I don't know how they get it so buttery, but who cares? It is awesome!"}
{"text":"ok so - they don't seem to have online ordering, but I LOVE their Buffalo Chicken pizza.  It is to DIE for - so that makes up for it."}
{"text":"Hands down the very best gluten-free pizza I have ever had!!!!!  The very sweet and adorable young man who took our order was amazing! He was completely aware of their gluten free menu items and told me that the owner's son has a gluten allergy so they are extremely careful about possible cross contamination. I ordered the mega meat pizza with gluten-free crust and subbed out mushrooms for the gluten containing meatballs. The pizza was fantastic! My two non-gluten challenged dining partners gobbled up the GF pizza and loved it! They both said they would order it again.  The service is amazing! The prices are very reasonable! Barro's is made of win!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have something bad come from this Borro's specifically. Tried the chicken barbecue pizza last week it was awesome we get the wings almost every time we go in there always perfect"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! However, having two handicap parking spots and no sidewalk ramp is basically pointless. How is that accommodating?"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pizza & wings. Dining in or out, service is fast, polite & friendly."}
{"text":"I'm usually a pizza hut kinda girl and I dont really venture out to eat at other pizza joints but im tired of pizza hut and decided to try Barro's. I have to say I am pleasantly suprised. I will never eat pizza hut again after tasting Barro's. The pizza was hot and very delicious. I loved that it had a lot of toppings. This is definitely my new first choice for pizza! Thanks Barros."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the sauce. My boyfriend and I stopped in for a pizza and a beer... They had a Gluten-Free beer, I don't have an intolerance or anything, but I tried it and I liked it. The atmosphere is very Chicago pub style."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza. Affordable. Clean place. They know how to take care of their customers. I am very appreciative!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness, Greasy, Cheesy. Will never get pizza Hut or domino's again, unless if I'm in a budget lol  Small pepperoni pizza 7.99  Delivery took 50min, I don't mind.  Wings are pretty good too.  I got Medium the first time but for me they tasted more like mild. This time I got hot and their perfect."}
{"text":"We are visiting this area and wanted a good pizza. We got it!  We had the Barro's Special. It had just enough of each item on it and the crust is some of the best I've had. Not too thick or thin & perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Barro's in da house.  They recently opened nearby and I've been anxiously awaiting this event.  Last night I did a takeaway so I could enjoy the Olympics with my pizza.    Calling in the order was easy, I checked the menu online, which is extensive, but I went with a standard order - large pizza with Black Olive and Pepperoni and a dozen hot wings.  Girl on the phone says pizza will be ready in 15-20 minutes at 5:30pm  I think this is a reflection of how new they are, only open for two weeks.  I imagine that prep time will increase as their presence becomes known.  So, I go down to pick up my stuff, and the dining room is nice with a big dividing wall separating the dining room from a counter with three cashiers and about six draft beers on tap.  It was nice, but three cashiers?  Maybe they are a bit too optimistic, I don't see people lining up like at In and Out.   I get the pie home and it looks wonderful.  A thick, chewy crust with a bit of crunch to it, lots of real mozzarella cheese (not that blended shit others use), and a decent arrangement of 'roni and olives.  It looked delish.  The dozen wings were not as hot as I prefer, but the wife says they were hot enough for her.  The wings were large and meaty and came with three sticks of celery and some Ranch dipping sauce.  You could choose Blue Cheese as well.  Love the wings.    The pizza was well-distributed with toppings and came with a decent amount of sauce.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for our liking, and that was a bit off-putting, but I gotta give props for otherwise a decent pie.  I think Barro's will do fine in this neighborhood, but for me, sweet sauce is a no, so I don't think I will be back for pizza.  I still give them four stars because everything else was spot-on.  Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Husband and I were gonna go out to eat and frolic, but we decided to just Netlix and chill with a a large double pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, black olive, garlic, sausage and yellow pepper pizza instead! The best part is Barro's delivered it to my door with 45 minutes! Barro's makes a tasty, flavorful pizza. Yes, I will totally order from here again. So, so good!!  I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the West Valley!  So sad that Duner's left town, but now there is a decent pizza place fairly close to home.  And ... they deliver!  Wings are good too.  Next time you are craving pizza and don't want to drive, call for delivery.  You won't be disappointed.  We had the meat pizza and also the sausage.  Their sausage is delicious.  Just go for it!"}
{"text":"The lady that served us was rude mean and lazy. Didn't want to work.  I wasn't able to enjoy my food because she had upset me by her rude comment on wow your baby screams like what's it to you no one likes being told anything about their baby. Plus when we asked her for a to go box she didn't hand it it was more like tossed it. I'm never coming here again!!!! I will also be putting a comment on your actual website."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, the boneless chicken wings are awesome, my kids and I loved it. This is our favorite pizza for office lunch too"}
{"text":"We hit the lunch special, which the low price earned 2 stars. But it stopped there. The salad \"bar\" was maybe 12 items to choose from including the lettuce, and it did the trick but wasn't impressive.  I got the cheese Pizza, he got the sausage.  I was puzzled on how a piece of cheese pizza with what seems like a 1\" thick fluffy bread crust could leave such a grease puddle. His was the same, but included precisely 4 pinches of sausage. I can see how they can offer the low price lunch special by keeping toppings to a minimum.   The crust reminded me of the par-baked \"boboli\" type crust you get that the grocery store. Sauce was good, cheese was oddly greasy.   If you like a very big hunk of fluffy, chewy, Doughy pizza, this place is for you! If you like more crunch, flavor and creativity, I would try another place."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor from out of town. Tried to get them to deliver a pizza a total of 5 miles away and was told it was out of their delivery area. Sad I got rejected but I'm sure this review will make a statement. Don't offer to deliver if \"you can't deliver\"."}
{"text":"The staff are great and the wings are really delicious but the pizza wasn't that good in my opinion."}
{"text":"I tried the thin crust and had it delivered during the week in the early evening.  It is decent pizza and I would eat it again.  I still like a couple other places in the area better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. I always get a pepperoni and pineapple pizza with ranch on the side. It's awesome. Always friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Barro's PIzza in South Chandler,   Pizza overall ok,  I choose the white pizza.  it was ahh ok.  Pizza crust, cooked very nice with a crisp crust.    Everything is clean and looks nice.  Nothing really jumps out at me why I would differ this place from anywhere else.    Family Story, Barro's Pizza has over 30 locations and still growing.   I'm glad for them I\"ll be back at another locations with friends and hope to give a  review why I became a fan. for now  umm. ok  Kevin"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm at my mom's house and we have the pizza craving then it's always Barro's. Well tonight was one of those cravings.   I was pretty impressed when I walked in. I thought it looked really nice inside compared to other Barro's I've been too. Nice dark wood interior. Tile floors and lots of TV all around the dining area. No matter where you sit there's a TV to watch your favorite sport.   When you walk in, you order your pizza and wings at the counter and you get a number for your table. They had plenty of people helping at the counter. Very friendly and helpful.   We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza with a medium order of wing with mild and another with BBQ. 24 wings in all. The pizza was really good. A little greasy at the bottom but we ate the whole thing. So no complaints there. The wings were really good too. The mild had a nice zing to them. Just right for my taste buds and my wife always likes the BBQ. Not spicy at all. The sauce wasn't overpowering. Just right.   Overall we really liked the pizza and wings. Gobbled it all up. Eat up and enjoy."}
{"text":"Updated They've earned their 5th star, in my experience. Never screwed up an order, pleasant, helpful, on time, decent prices, a GREAT antipasto Salads, KILLER PIZZA. Thin crust, regular, about any kind of topping you can think of. The folks who deliver are good people too.  One Word....  BELISIMO!!!  I am a recent relocatee, from the East Coast Connecticut to be specific. New York & Chicago  have good Pizza, Barro's THE BEST ! (Try a Ham and Pepperoni pie, I like the thin crust version but whatever you want they have. Great people too, very organized and  Extremely pleasant.  The 'Cheers' of Restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, but lacks consistency for the most part. Sometimes it's amazing, but sometimes it's borderline mediocre. At its worst it's edible, but I expected more from a great pizza restaurant like Barro's."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with my visit this evening. I'm a frequent customer of the Barros in goodyear on Estrella and McDowell and always have a great visit and the management ROCKS. Tonight we were on the other side of town and I ordered a pickup order and was quoted 20 minutes. My order took 42 minutes- and the manager realized that my food had been ready the entire time I was in the lobby waiting but none of the girls bothered calling my name or were paying attention. When I called the manager. After getting home to find my wings cold he said there was absolutely nothing he could do for me unless I wanted to bring the wings back to swap them - because it is \"against their policy.\"  So I could wait another 40 minutes? On top of driving through i17 Rush hour traffic? No thanks. I have family that work for Barros so I know their policy well. I feel ripped off and am disappointed that I just paid 10 bucks for cold wings, but more discouraged with the lack of customer service that I received from the management and counter girls.  I'll stick to the goodyear location."}
{"text":"Their pizza is average. Typically was to greasy. They do deliver fast and always have friendly staff. Their wings are good."}
{"text":"If you live in the area this is the only pizza joint around! Thank goodness it's awesome! Their cheese is phenomenal. We've done dine in and take out, both great experiences and they offer gluten free pizza crust."}
{"text":"Barros is my favorite pizza joint. You can't find a better pizza anywhere. Years ago when we moved out of state, we bemoaned that we could no longer eat at Barros. When we moved back to Arizona, it was one of the first restaurants that we visited.   I haven't eaten a Barros pizza that I don't like!  Ham and pineapple is one of our favs. The crust is always chewy, crunchy and perfect.   Employees at this location were friendly and efficient.   The pizza is always the best when eaten in the restaurant!    We will return many more times!"}
{"text":"When we want good pizza, we go to Barros. It's best when eaten in the restaurant - fresh and hot. I don't think pizza travels well in a box - it starts to steam and it affects the crust.   Good service, good pizza, good prices, clean, efficient and friendly employees.  Plenty of TV's to watch the game.   Lunch specials.    No complaints!"}
{"text":"Good pizza could be better but its pizza so I like it no matter what"}
{"text":"Visiting from outta state and kids wanted pizza. I must say all the kids liked it no one complained. Great crust!!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved and were recommended to try Barro's Pizza.  Since then, we have tried a few others, but back to Barro's Pizza.  Great specials and Great Staff.  Enjoy all the T.V's that show the local games.  and Always clean.  Delivery is very good, always friendly and upbeat like Pizza Delivery-guys should be."}
{"text":"Our family orders regularly from Barro's.  We have enjoyed the cheese, pepperoni, sausage & Barro's special (meat and veggies).  The pizza is very good & they deliver so you can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"If your a fan of an ok thick crust slice Barro's may be the pizzeria your looking for but this place's pizza was middling at best in my opinion. Its a step above Costco Pizza but not on the level of places like Venezia's.   Like Joan said better then Domino's but not by much~"}
{"text":"Good wings, no gluten-free pizza (yet), and an unassuming salad bar.  The kids section is very helpful when trying to devour two dozen wings in under five minutes."}
{"text":"According to my wife and kids, the pizza is the best in this part of the Valley.    According to me, their gluten-free pizza is the second best I've ever had (#1 is Palo Alto Pizza in, well, Palo Alto).  Much better crust than the Barro's on Power and destroys the spongey gluten free substance called pizza at a number of other places.  The wings are huge and delicious.    Great place for kids and dads looking to watch some sports while their kids play in the kids' area."}
{"text":"My son and I found this Barro's by accident. Service was great and knowledgeable staff regarding the brews on tap. Ordered pizza & wings, no complaints. Sat out on the patio, misters on, what a great night!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and decided to give this place a try. Not only was I hung up on 4 times, the girl, Madison was very rude when telling me. \"I still can't even hear you!\" She then hung up. I called back from three phones and was hung up on every time after asking to speak with a manager. It seems YOU may have been the ones with \"phone issues\" due to the fact we have successfully completed one phone call to Zella's Pizza and our delivery is currently underway.  They even hooked us up with extra discounts. Zella's pizza is the way to go! Zero stars for Barros.  The girls at Barros should take notes on good customer service from the wonderful staff at Zella's Pizza!"}
{"text":"Failed again.  I've had pizza from other Barros and really liked it.  For some reason, this location can't seem to figure out how to actually cook a pizza. Every single time the pizza has been undone. Crust on the bottom is not crisp and the center of the pizza is obviously not done.  Friday I gave them one last chance because my daughter wanted them but I also ordered some wings for me as a backup if the pizza wasn't cooked because I hate uncooked pizza. Sure enough, the pizza wasn't cooked. It needed at least another 5 minutes in their oven. So, I ate my wings which were ok but no pizza.  I'm done. I'll never buy food from that location again."}
{"text":"Pizza, wings, and cheesy breadsticks are all excellent. We order here frequently and have never had anything to complain about- one of our favorite pizza delivery places!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, good price, reminds me of Pizza places of my childhood. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Literally the best delivery pizza and wings in avondale/goodyear. Bonus?? The delivery radius is huge!!! My go to every friday!!!!"}
{"text":"Just like all the other ones.  Fast service, good food and no complaints.  Very clean."}
{"text":"My review is about the amazing lunch specials. I don't think there is a better deal for 2 slices and a drink out there. The pizza is great for how much you pay. Definitely a great spot for a quick cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Love Barros and have always had good service!"}
{"text":"We visit about once a week and always get treated very well. The pizza and wings are delicious! After enjoying your meal I recommend trying out their pizookies (Ice cream on top of a fresh baked cookie). The prices are all very reasonable."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Barros pizza for any team or group event! Jason, the manager, was extremely accommodating for all of our needs! Jason had reserved two tables with very little notice, told me about specials that could save us money and had the pizzas ready right when we walked in the door. The volleyball team loved the pizza and it was so affordable! We will definitely be back anytime we have another team event! Thank you Jason for being so kind and providing such amazing customer service!!"}
{"text":"Food is great! pizza is a little pricey compared to  pizza hut. However the pizza is very very worth it! it is awesome and tasty for left overs. I hate left overs so that's saying something! They don't allow your dogs inside the restaurant thru even if they are in a stroller."}
{"text":"Great pizza in the area but yes it will cost you $40 for large pizza and 24 wings.  They need to increase their staff especially during dinner time. Had to wait an extra 20 min total of 40 min for my pizza. They did offer to give my next order free."}
{"text":"The family and I love this place. The pizza is fantastic, they load on the toppings. Definitely try the Chicken Supreme. You won't be disappointed.    My kids really enjoy playing and eating in the kids area and devour the pizza.   The price is very reasonable and even more so when considering all the food you get. I highly recommend Barro's Pizza."}
{"text":"Good food and the workers are always really friendly. I like being able to go to a place where no one complains about the kids getting too loud. And I also like the fact that I can get wings, a pizza and watch the World Series all in one place. Will make this a family tradition move ng fo"}
{"text":"Barro's! My 2nd favorite pizza place in PHX only trumped by Fatso's. You know what Barro's has that Fatso's doesn't though?...better prices. Barro's pizza is just delicious all around. I've always had the most pleasant customer service at this location. The employees are polite and friendly!"}
{"text":"Anyone can tell you that that Barro's Pizza has great pizza and their prices are in line with other pizza chains.  The first thing I'd like to mention is that while you can only get it in a small, they DO have Udi's gluten free crust available for those who have gone GF and are needing a pizza fix.  Second, they don't skimp on toppings.  Third, kudos to this location's pizza delivery drivers because they deliver to the state prison for us (staff, of course, not inmates  LOL).  We appreciate it!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is great, but they have terrible customer service!  The girl's at the counter taking your order, act like they really hate their jobs, they are not pleasant at all!  They forgot to get us our salad, we had to go ask for it, but we keep going back, because they have great food.  Maybe they could talk to their counter girl's and ask them to be a little more pleasant to their customers!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town!!  My husband and I have tried dozens of places and this place is the best!!!!  Crispy and tons of flavor.  Pizza is loaded with toppings, great taste.  Crust is perfectly fluffy and chewy.  Ranch is delicious.  I wish they served cannolis for dessert.  So happy they deliver to our home!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location and i I for one will never go to this location again! The pizza was good but I almost got ran over by a delivery driver walking back to my car with my pizza...They took longer than the estimated time to get my order and the employees or should I say children that were working were rude. I couldn't believe when I asked to buy extra ranch(you only get one for every 12 wings) the girl proceeded to tell me that it's actually \"ALOT \" more than necessary cause she doesn't use that much...How much ranch I want to BUY is only her business cause she is selling the dressing."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone when placing a simple order. I call this store pretty frequently, but I have never had such a terrible experience as the one I just had. The woman on the phone interrupted me frequently and didn't listen to anything I was saying. As a frequent customer, my phone number is in the system. I had to repeat my number 3 times for her because she kept insisting I wasn't in the system, when in fact, I knew that was impossible. I even had to call her back because she hung up to abruptly before I could correct her on something. I love this Barro's, but I really wish they would hire employees that provide better customer service."}
{"text":"Went there today for a quick kinda late lunch. 1:30. No pizza in the case, waited for 20 minutes still no pizza then told them I had to have it to go because my lunch time was over. Got back to my office, the worst pizza I have EVER had! I am so disappointed. Have gone there on many occasions always been great. They really missed the mark today!"}
{"text":"Pizza's still good. But WTF with the wings? Second time I've ordered wings and second time they're under cooked. Manager said, \"We cook everything to temp.\" Like I'm a f_____g moron for being upset that I found bloody wings in my order. Really? If the skin on your wings is soft, floppy, or slimy; put the damned things back in the heat!"}
{"text":"Don't not go there or order online . We ordered food from there and we asked that it be delivered at 7:30 . It did not show up until 8:30 cold and nasty. When I called they did not care. I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"When we can, we order Barros pizza and wings.  Never been disappointed in the food, pizza so good and wings are plump.  But the other great part is that MISSY who takes our phone orders is so CUSTOMER FRIENDLY!!!  The first time we order we weren't sure and she guided us through, even though they are always busy, but she makes you feel like you are first of her attention.  Thank you Barros Pizza..."}
{"text":"This is the best place for pizza! I don't know what it is about Barro's but it's irresistible. The place has a pretty nice atmosphere, it's normally pretty quiet without the crazy hustle of a normal restaurant. Personally I like it, it's laid back. The lunch deals are really great! Slices/drink combos are cheap and the deals change by the day of the week. The wings here are really great as well! Great customer service, the girls at the counter are really helpful and patient. This is my go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Pizza!  For those that need/want it, Barro's has it.    I have discovered a new taste treat for my pizza.  Pepperoni, Pinapple, and......wait for it......BACON!  Yes, it is soooo yummy!  And Barro's makes a killer pizza.  I have gone to dine in a few times now and the first time I went in I was suprised at how big it is.  There is a large back room and a great little \"kid's korner\" with a long table and chairs and a flat screen TV on the wall.  The kids sit and eat their pizza and they can watch Nick or the Disney Channel.  My daughter loves it!   This is a great place to hang out, have a pizza and relax."}
{"text":"Gosh we just love the pizza by the slice here. The boys were always looking forward to pizza day after we all played in the neighborhood basketball park.  Many years and many locations, but this one is home. Good times. The pizza is fresh and excellent. You know, maybe it's pizza tonight!!"}
{"text":"From out of town, we ordered this one night for delivery.  The pizza was good with a thick-ish chewy crust which I like.  Delivery was reasonably quick and the price was affordable."}
{"text":"I love love love love love this Barros!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been ordering for the past five years and im sad Im moving the others are not as pleasant.. You guys ROCKKKKKKKKKKKKK AND DONA GREAT JOB OF FILLING MY BELLY"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Goodyear, Arizona discoveries!!! Great pizza, awesome atmosphere, friendly employees, fair prices! Love their food, love the fact that they run daily lunch specials! You've got to try some of their specialty pizzas, the Kona, the White pizza, and Hot Wing are best of the best!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go on Sunday at noon. Call was handled very well with a good amount of intelligence. Nice change. Pizza was ready as promised on time. Pizza was very good with tons of toppings. We enjoyed"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pepperoni on traditional crust and 12 medium wings for delivery.  The girl on the phone was pleasant and the food arrive fast and hot.  Overall the food was good.  The wings were cooked perfectly, but the medium sauce was fairly flavorless and didnt have any heat.  The pizza was a bit too greasy, but just like the wings it was cooked perfectly.  The traditional crust was heavy.  I've had a fair amount of Chicago deep dish and this seemed like a much heavier dough.  However, this is not a compliant.  Overall a great first experience.  We will likely try some of their specialty pizzas and other wing flavors in the future and that could bump up the raring, but our first experience was a solid 4."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza is so good!! Had it once and I've been coming back. Definitely recommend coming here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When we are too tired to cook, and want a guaranteed yummy pizza, this is the place to go. OR when we meet  up with other friends that  have  kids under five, we meet up here.   Favorite pizzas are the combo or  all meat pizza. They have all  the standard toppings and their crust is semi-thick. For those from the SF Bay Area, this place reminds me of Round Table.  The kids spaghetti and meatballs is so  yummy, and  the prices are right.  There's a place for little kids to play in the dining  room.  I think it must be an annoying place to eat if you do not have kids.  One  time, a man  yelled at me because all the loud kids in the place were annoying him -  I thought it was funny because I was only responsible for one of the ten running around. Bottom line, this place caters to families  -  so if you are a kid-less couple looking for a quiet romantic pizza dinner, order take out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The cheese is always extra gooey and the crust is thick and tasteful.  Service has been consistently good, and their prices are affordable. A large pepperoni will cost about $10ish.  Wings are HUGE. Not a fan of the sauces ive tried thus far but theyre definitely filling!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not sure how much of a \"chain\" this place is but I've never heard of it outside of Arizona. This is typically our go-to pizza place. We don't ever order Domino's or Pizza Hut since you can get better quality food here for the same price or less.   A large pepperoni is usually $11-12.  Their wings are pretty good but theyre heavy with the sauce. Its usually overwhelming and I actually stay away from them now. But they're very large in size which could be a plus for those looking for more for their money.   Service is great, we order ahead and pick up or even get delivery. The wait time is almost always 45 minutes to an hour."}
{"text":"I love love love their white pizza!! It's so good!  The chicken wings are the best around. Pulano's used to hold that title for me but something happened and Barro's stole the spotlight.  My brother in law loves when I come to town because I always want to go get pizza and wings.  There just aren't any good places here in this Michigan area.    Barro's wings are crispy with a great sauce.  The pizza was fresh and good quality cheese and meats. (I added sausage)  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Order 4 pizzas and some wings for a get together over the weekend.  Pleasantly surprised by the quality of pizza - good chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and a fair amount of toppings.  They had some pizza specials going as well.  The wings weren't that great - too much sauce on both the bbq ones and the hot sauce ones.  Will come back for their pizza soon!"}
{"text":"I love Barro's Pizza, literally their pizza. ;) Every Friday we order a Barro's specialty pizza to go. I've never had any complaints. The mozzarella sticks are nothing crazy good, just your typical cheese sticks. We've also had the boneless wings before, which were good also. Hands down the best pizza though. If you want delivery, order about 45 minutes in advance. =)"}
{"text":"Cant beat it for a $5 lunch.  Great pizza, very fast service, clean establishment."}
{"text":"What a great go to place for some really good pizza. We've been there a number of times and each time the food was tasty and satisfying. We will certainly be back to enjoy the food they serve."}
{"text":"Love Barros! In my opinion it's the best pizza and wings in the valley! I've had the so called authentic lasagna thick Chicago style pizza and the cardboard thin, greasy New York style but if you just want a really good pizza go with Barros."}
{"text":"Hi  Manager contacted me shortly after I posted review.  Was invited to try them again and was offered a pizza.  Went last night.  Called it in and was quoted 20-25 mins.  Walked in about 30 mins later, pizza was hot and ready.  Had mushrooms on it. Thanks.  This is the pizza I know and love here."}
{"text":"Needless to say, this is the worst experience and quite possibly the worst location ever. The phone service was terrible. I talked Jenna and she was super rude. When I got there, the place was a mess and no one seemed to care about the MANY dirty tables. As I approached the counter, I asked if i could eat my pizza here instead and the girl helping me was very snarky. I have never seen or experienced such terrible customer service. If management can't keep the staff in line enough to clean the dining room, I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. The restaurant is clean. The beer is priced very well and includes local brews. The radio station IS THE BEST!!!! Its good for groups in a semi private room with a scary clown ride!"}
{"text":"Delicious again.  Got pizza, spaghetti, an Italian sandwich and wings.  Only complaint is they asked if I wanted to add \"meatballs\". I said yes and they gave me one single meatball. Lol. If they asked if I wanted one single meatball, I would have said no."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good atmosphere,  great food (specially the Ravioli and the Penney pasta- highly recommended!!). The portions are generous. The sauce tastes homemade. I came across this place after watching my Dodgers at Camelback Ranch. Very affordable and the great thing about it all together is that it wasn't packed even during lunch time. I will definitely be coming back during spring training."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good by I get wings when I go there and I get crispy wings they are really good. And the customer service is good also."}
{"text":"You have to order at the counter, you're given a little pole with a number on it to take to your table.   We ordered: Medium pepperoni pizza Child's chick strips Small salad 6 hot wings  The pizza was just \"ok\". Salad was fine. Childs chicken strips was 6 tiny, heavily breaded chunks of chicken smaller that McDonald's chicken nuggets. And didn't come with fries..only a small bag of plain potato chips. LAME  The hot wings were anything but hot. Slimy, yes. Hot, no. The salad was fine.   All in all, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza is the best pizza in the state of Arizona.  Make sure you get some ranch to dip your pizza in... yummy good."}
{"text":"Apparently, Barro ' s has decided that their gluten free offering is ok with a pre - made crust.   I can say that it's NOT.    It tastes like cardboard."}
{"text":"We love this place for delicious and inexpensive pizza. Perfect to take kids!! They just did a moderate redecorating of the interior so it's even nicer than ever. You won't be disappointed in the food or the value."}
{"text":"6 service reps standing at the counter holding personal conversations with each other, when I asked if I could be helped, they were rude about it.  I placed my order was told 20-25 minute wait, after 35 minutes, I approached the counter and now I'm being told it will be another 15-20 minutes. Everyone sitting and waiting for their orders have the same complaint. Poor service, poor timely response. Would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was our first and last experience with Barro's. The girl who answered the phone was okay; a bit curt in my opinion. Verified my address twice and I provided her the access code to the community where we live. Twenty minutes later, my phone rings and a man says \"yeah, yo, like what's the apartment number?\" Excuse me? Why did the girl who answered bother asking me twice if she wasn't going to relay it? She also didn't give the man the code to the gate, but he got in somehow. I tipped, begrudgingly and even more so when the order was wrong. A simple delivery order- large BBQ pizza and Italian sub (cold)  came with what I consider a medium pizza and a toasted sub. Maybe not the biggest deal for most, but when paying almost $30 got two items, they should have been correct! Needless to say I can only assume the poor service is a reflection of poor management which I have no respect or time for so we will not be visiting this or any other Barro's location."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and salad! I always have great service regardless of eating in or ordering delivery. I love the spicy southwest pizza! A must!"}
{"text":"YUM! We ate at Barro's tonight. The pizza was good, staff was great and the restaurant was empty.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it was so dang cold in there."}
{"text":"I find this pizza very mediocre. It is more crust than toppings and can be very doughy. I will rarely get this and only if I am like right next door and super hungry."}
{"text":"I was bringing pizza to a friend in the area and saw this place was close by. So I figured I'd order to go. It was super packed (always a good sign).The staff was friendly; so were the other customers I sat next to while I was waiting. Each of us on the edge of our seats, drooling each time they called someone's name.   I wasn't getting anything fancy, just 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni. But it was delish! Flavorful, cheesy, and I loved the puffy crust. Next time I am in the neighborhood, I am definitely stopping here again. And I want to try their other pizzas as well. Oh, and the salad bar."}
{"text":"I love this place. Im glad this one is so close to my house. Pizza is good, wings are ok. I tried the club sub very good. Always leave here satisfied."}
{"text":"I usually never like to try new pizza restaurants. But Im really glad I tried this place. I luv their pizza. Now its one of my favorite pizza places to eat at. Wings are good too. & they have a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top dessert that is amazing."}
{"text":"Barro's is so awesome!!! Not only was the pizza piping hot, but also delicious!! We ordered a large, thick crust with pepperoni, Italian sausage, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes. We also ordered a 10 inch cold club sandwich. Soo freekin good!  I want to give a special thanks to the staff for helping me surprise my parents with lunch for their anniversary!! You all were super nice, fast and friendly! My parents had never eaten Barro's, but we're so impressed, they said they will be placing their own orders from now on! Again, thank you so much for all your help and advice on the food!"}
{"text":"Pizza delivery was fairly fast, (more like it arrived exactly when I expected it to, which is great) This was my first time ordering so I was skeptical. So glad I ordered, I just moved here from NY and this is the best pizza I've gotten since my move!   Amazing, ***** always ordering pizza from you guys! Stay open later!"}
{"text":"The night started great when me and my 4 closest friends decided to order take out from our girls night from our favorite pizza place. We then ordered from a not so friendly cashier and then proceeded to wait for our food and leave. As we arrived home it came to our realization that they had forgot to give us our cheesy garlic breadsticks. We called back and the woman took a very annoyed tone with us and and said we could come back and get it if we were around. We picked it up and our bazookie was a crusty cookie that was not appetizing. It was not even chocolate chip. The cheesy garlic bread over cooked and missing cheese. Basically burnt garlic strips. Didn't get the order at all right. Not good customer service. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Friendly service feels like  a wholesome family run place.  I love their cheese bread.   Great value for melted cheese on pizza bread.  Roomy and like \"serve yourself\" fountain drinks. Low key place perfect for casual night.  order at counter and they bring out to us."}
{"text":"i love there all veggie pizza and my husband loves the special or mega meat! We do half and half and the medium sized is perfect and last for a couple of days!! there wings are very meaty as well. the wait time usually takes about 45 to 60 min when ordered over the phone, but when eating their pizza, i could see why!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is okay and the wings are soggy and terrible. That's it. Everyone is really nice and the service is good."}
{"text":"Cheesy pepperoni deliciousness!! Every Friday our family makes a choice to eat out and it's pretty much become our Pizza Friday's at Barros"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent customer service.   Always fresh and fast delivery.  Tonight they forgot to add extra sauce to our wings.  We had gotten them for carry out.  The manager was above and beyond kind and helpful.  He made us new wings that were delicious and delivered then to us in a flash.    It not often you get customer service like that.   I didn't get his name, but thank you!!"}
{"text":"Besides the pizza being mediocre at best, apparently I should know better and request a fork to eat my salad with when I have food delivered to my hotel. Armando the \"manager\" is clearly young so I can't blame him to much for his lack of sincerity and his sarcastic childish tone. Yes we travel A LOT and NO we will never use this delivery restaurant again!  Ok I have to edit this I called back and spoke to manager Wade. He actually listened to me and APOLOGIZED. In one call he elevated my experience.  Thank you Wade. We will give Barro another shot"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Eat in, carry out, or have them delivery it to your door! Mega meat pizza is our go-to!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is near and dear to my heart. I grew up just down the street, and worked here for 3 years in high school and beyond. I ate this pizza every day, and would still come in on my days off. I moved out of town, and this is still a must every time I come back. The dough is fresh, and a secret. Michael himself used to bring in the yeast mixture to be mixed with the flour and water. The cheese is fresh grated. The veggies are fresh cut each day too. The quality just can't be beat. The crust is thick and chewy, but not heavy. The sausage is put on in big chunks. I just took my son in today to experience it for the first time. He says, it's the best pizza he has ever eaten. He is 8 years old now, and eats a fair amount of pizza, so that is saying something!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Barros... love the pizza, wings, food, etc... I ordered delivery from this location recently and the wings were the only thing that was correct on the order. SUPER disappointed that it took so long and that nothing was right. I have never had this problem with any other barros, but I will definitely think twice before ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"I have been a big Barros fan for YEARS and I will most definitely not be ordering from this location again. When I heard Barros finally had online ordering I was very excited... First time I tried it, it took forever and the order was less than what I normally expect Barros to be. I tried it a second time, expecting that there was kinks with the new system and things were better than last time, still took quite a while, but quality of food was better for sure. Tonight I decided to give it one more whirl... And here I am... An hour and a half after my order, and it still hasn't gotten here. I called around the hour and fifteen mark, was placed on hold and told that my order was \"on the way\" -- the cashier answering the phone really didn't seem empathetic at all. Just very disappointing overall. I'm going back to ordering from the Williamsfield Road location because they are always very timely and accurate with their orders."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to national chains.  Great pizza at a great price and usually a coupon is readily available.  This location is no frills and the salad bar is basically extra pizza toppings. Yet its always clean and the staff is normally friendly even when phone swamped.  Barros won't knock your socks off but it always has great, wallet friendly pizza pie."}
{"text":"Friday night enjoying a Barro's special.  Ready and delivered to our table.  Lots of ingredients. Pizza is delicious.  Plenty of tables for your group.  A couple of games to play while you wait for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch special. There was a line but it moved rather quickly,  maybe a 5 min wait with 5-6 people ahead of me. You can't beat the lunch combo prices but I was a bit disappointed with the salad. Slice, garden salad & soda for less than $5 w/tax so a decent price but I was craving a salad & expected it to be a bit more fresh & less soggy. The salad was brought up front from the kitchen so not sure when it was made but the tomatoes were mush & a fair amount of the lettuce was brown/wilty. I had the pepperoni slice & it was decent, tho not my go-to but again for the lunch special, not bad Working in Mesa since Jan. & I have tried a few places but not sure I would get a salad again @Barros. We live in Glendale & delivery & pick-up frequently & do enjoy their pizza. This location has the anty compared to 67th Ave in Glendale - nice bar & restaurant whereas 67th has the full strip mall look & feel with no bar/music so I would dine in at this location."}
{"text":"Pizza is mega rad. I'm a sucker for chewy, bubbly crust like theirs. And you can't beat the lunch specials at less than five bucks for pizza and a drink! Salad bar is a little sketch sometimes at this location. I've seen too many young ones duck the sneeze guard and get crazy with the toppings."}
{"text":"Barro's is what Digiorno wishes it could be with that rising crust crap. I swear, if I could eat Barro's every day without my arteries protesting, I would. (And could, because it's cheaper compared to other pricier options like Venezia's and Spinato's.)  The cheese is high quality, salty, melty, and they don't skimp. The crust is chewy and thick and awesome with some of those rad mega crust bubbles near the edge. The toppings are always high quality and generous. The wings are thick and juicy, deep fried to a crisp and then smothered in the perfect amount of sauce. And they deliver to me three miles away, which makes me super happy."}
{"text":"Have always loved barros.  Tonight was my daughters school fundraiser at barros.  Love the place!  Hsbd forgot wallet when doing pickup, so I call to pay over phone.  I get security and fraud and all that.......but if I did delivery, I would give my card # over phone.  Sorry, its our corporate policy.  So how bout I change my order to delivery?  Well, then my daughters school wont get money....pickup only.  Corporate bs.  Great pizza, but I wont be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"The first time we ordered from Barros the pizza was amazing and got here quick, decent prices too. Our second delivery order was an hour later than we were quoted, especially since we preordered for a specific time...a little annoyed but the manager called and gave me a 20% off coupon for \"being cool about it.\" The pizza however, was not fully cooked. Last time we opted out if pizza, ordering sanwhiches pasta and salad. Food was good but again I was told 45 minutes and it took about two hours. Not even an apology, grumpy and hungry toddlers and it was nothing. The girls who answer the phones are immature and unprofessional. I've been out on hold 4 times in one phone call and them someone new will answer and starty order before placing me on hold for the next person...over all food is a hit or miss but delivery times and service sucks. Perhaps it's better in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We are in Mesa just for the day, on business.  By the time we were finished with business we were beat, so we ordered pizza delivered to our hotel.  Delivery was in half the stated time and it was hot.  I admit that we were starved but, the pizza was so good we both had an extra piece.  If we're ever in the area again, we would surely order from them again."}
{"text":"it wasn't bad just wasn't good. the bread was too thick and dense. the toppings not that exciting. pretty good chicken wings otherwise it would have been a 2/5."}
{"text":"We were there on Nov 16th my 51st Birthday and it was totally unacceptable the events that took place.(First) I couldn't wait to get there for the S Bar as I do enjoy it, We were there around 3 pm or so and it was the most pathetic looking salad area I have ever come across,The lettuce was fine however,The cheese was empty there was no egg but plenty of small white onion pieces.(i am allergic to onions) and they were everywhere.The bar itself was not cleaned and bits and pieces of  folks salads were all over,Someone had dumped ham into the cottage cheese.No one ever cleaned it up.while we were there, Very Upsetting,There were 4 orders and 2 of them sat up there at the register and never got to us,The young lady said she forgets things, Great on my day when I was hungry and could eat (dialysis pat) I get the bad day at Barros award.(it was all kids back there and the gentleman we usually see was not there).We had to leave after 50 mins as they had just brought 2 pieces of nothing special ordered pizza to us. I would have to say the food itself was sub-par.I have not been back and probably wont return, The salad bar that I have enjoyed at every visit should have been presentable and clean.....I am very upset I had to write this article for yelp"}
{"text":"We have never had Barros and decided to try it for the first time via delivery. We ordered a XL Barros special, Med pepperoni and 24 nake wings with the fire sauce on the side. It took an hour for delivery which is the normal timeframe.  However we were a little disappointed with our Barros special pizza because when we got it the bottom of the pizza was completely soggy. We couldn't even pick it up so we ate it with a fork.  I don't know if that's the normal because the heavy topping or the box? The pepperoni one came out good and the wings were perfect. We may give it another try but for now this place is not for us."}
{"text":"We love this place. Always great service and delicious pizza. The crust is the best. So fluffy. The girls there are really helpful and Aaron, the manager takes good care of us. We bring the family for lunch often. Yumm!"}
{"text":"It's extremely hard for me to give ONE star, but this Barro's makes it easy.  I'm actually planning to bump up my only another ONE star to a TWO star just to make this Barro's the joke of AZ.  But that would be dishonest and I don't do sh*t like that.   To the experience.  Came here one night for dinner with a former co-worker to eat and catch up.  This place was messy... what the hell is the staffs doing?? Talking about their crushes and gossiping???  Do they even work here?  Let's not even talk about the restroom.. I was once told how restroom is...usually tells you a lot about the kitchen, they're usually not far off from each other........GROSS!  Had I known this sooner I would have left before ordering.   The pizza was greasy and oily!  And with all that grease you would think the pizza would not feel and taste like cardboard with Campbell's Tomato Soup spilled over it....it did.  That night I starved, we could not finish a slice and didn't bother taking it home!   Do all the other Barro's a favour and close down, if you keep up with this crap you'll drag them all through the mud.  This to your \"no firearm\" sign ::middle finger::  Ohhh and consider yourself lucky that my phone was dead, or I would had pictures!!"}
{"text":"Twice in a row the food was delivered a lot later than we were told on the phone.  Well over an hour.  And cold.  I thought the first time was a fluke.  I can't imagine trying a third time.  I don't feel I can trust them anymore.  Update: After a long hiatus we decided to try one more time. The pizza arrived hot and on time!"}
{"text":"Barro's is my favorite place! The food is always perfect and the atmosphere is lively and very family friendly. The staff and management are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. I had the pleasure of meeting one of the managers named Jimmy. He was extremely friendly and made sure that my order was taken and made with out a hitch. I would definitely recommend the Barro's in Laveen to all my friends and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to dine in and try the lunch special.  Inexpensive and fast for lunch.   As for the pizza, I was impressed with the large ham pizza we had.  The cheese was stringy as I pulled each slice off the pan, delicious.  The pizza had a lot of cheese on it and was great.  I would describe the sauce as more on the sweet side.  I know some prefer bitter, but the sweeter sauce goes great with the more salty ham pizza we had.   We ordered a large pizza and between our family of 4 we could not finish it.  At only $11 for a large I consider that a great value.  Much of Barro's success is its super low prices and hot, fresh cheese they use.  The original crust also has a nice seasoning to it.  As for drinks they do offer beers, wine, and soda is at the $1.25 to 1.75 mark depending on size.  You refill your own soda, so about the norm price for a fast food place on drinks. If your looking for inexpensive pizza and want to dine in try Barros pizza.  Nothing like fresh pizza that does not hurt the pocket book."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Love that they deliever. The lady on the phone was really nice and the deliver guy was very polite and had a fantastic attitude. Pizza stayed warm for a while and the cinnamon sticks were devine. I would highly recommend getting pizza from here before dominos or pizza hut"}
{"text":"just moved in the area and i've ordered twice from this location, always on time and accurate. that bbq chicken pizza is amaaaazzziiiing, i manage a pizza restaurant so i know good pizza when i see it!"}
{"text":"So pumped they opened one close to my house!! And I'm within the boundaries for delivery. I've been praying for a Barros closer to our house because they have the best pizza! It is my absolute favorite pizza in Phoenix. I'm done with all the foo foo pizza that we are inundated with downtown. Sometimes a gal just wants pizza! Like dough, red sauce and cheese. I dont need figs, rare cheese I can't pronouand friggin truffle oil on my pizza! Anyway, well done Barros! My family will keep your delivery service very busy."}
{"text":"All the Barro's have good service and very good food.   This location however is just a bit special  because it has a great General Manager in Tom. He really is a super-friendly and nice guy and seems to hire people who 'get it' that customer service is really simple if you are sincere and enjoy helping your customers.   I am very loyal to Tom because of the many things he quietly does for the community as well and how responsive he is to my requests from my job. I work and live in Goodyear and can say that of all the business I approach for my job, Tom steps up and never waivers.   The lunch special is awesome and a total value. Shoot, half the City employees eat here because of the value.   So, good food, good people, great community asset!"}
{"text":"This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door."}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty dang good. Price is not to bad for what you get, the service is good I have been coming to this location for years and have never had any problems so if you want to get a quick bite to eat I would stop by and get there lunch special, pizza by the slice. If you stop by with the kiddos to they have a spot where they can play with toys."}
{"text":"Canned sauce, canned everything, mushy doughy dough. Blech. Garbage.  I have always been amazed that for years all the Barro's locations seem to rake in far more dough then they deserve considering the food is so darn mediocre.  This cardboard is one step above frozen - barely.  These are the conveyor belt pizzas that bite the dust - they don't taste yummy either. Where is Lucille Ball and Ethyl when you need them!   Some reviewers seem to like these pies because they remind them of their childhoods.   OK, well maybe your photo album would taste better with a little canned sauce and packaged mozzarella cheese on it?  If Phoenicians think these pies are the bomb, then maybe it has something to do with the wacky politics here - I dunno. I don't get it?  Am I being a pizza snob?   Maybe  Look, if you have super low expectations and compare these on a par with Dominos or Pizza Hut, then these might be considered fantastic pies by comparison.  For my taste, I try to stay stay away from any Barros anywhere. Yuck."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass. Pizza is done to order. Super friendly staff, Always. Staff answers any questions you have, and make suggestions.  Sounds like a given, but most places you barely you get noticed.  Pizza is always very well done and very delicious.  Salads are also so good.  The bbq chicken pizza is a great choice.  But a traditional cheese and pepperoni, can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Love that they have a gluten free crust option, and that my girls both loved it when they tried it.    The sauce is just okay, a bit on the bland side. Would love to see dairy free vegan cheese options.  Their prices are a bit high for the quality, but customer service was polite and professional."}
{"text":"At four stars I'm being generous, but only because the pizza and wings we're pretty good. If I was only rating them on their decor and lackluster salad bar it'd be two stars.  My partner wanted wings and I'm not a big fan so I consulted yelp.com as usual and found the wings at Barro's was rated pretty good. So, it solved my craving for pizza and his for wings.  When we walked in we almost decided to walk back out. OMG, this place needs a decor overhaul and how! It was like eating in someone's 1980 finished basement. They finished it but forgot to decorate it. The plastic plates were beige too.  As I said the pizza was good, if you like Chicago style pizza with a thicker crust, which I do. My partner gave the wings thumbs up, I didn't taste them."}
{"text":"As a Pizza lover and from Chicago I rank Rosati ' s as the best Pizza. Barro's comes close but lately very flat and greasy as teenagers seem to run this place. Inside the restaurant it could use a cleaning, very dusty and neglected. We used to order delivery every week for nearly 2 years and have now stopped due to the quality. Wish ownership get off his Yacht and fire up this locations Manager: watch quality and clean the dust off the walls and properly clean the tables. Compliancy is the failure of small business. I'll order a pizza in 2 weeks for one last go around then if not Tombstone I will eat: Ugh."}
{"text":"So we ordered our pizza and a mini pizza for my son. I know they said it takes 45 minutes to an hour. Our pizza got here a little over an hour. Ok, no big deal. As the delivery person was giving us our pizza, we noticed he did not give me my son's mini pizza. He stated they must have forgot to bag it correctly and told US to call the store and let them know. I called the store and asked to speak with the manager. He said his name was Jerry. I explained that they forgot my sons pizza and he said the delivery person must have forgot to give it to us. I told him that the driver said he didn't have it and that the store must have messed up the order. Jerry (manager) started to get defensive and told me the quicker he can get my order, the quicker he can get it delivered. Instead of taking 15 minutes it would take 25 minutes. Still seemed defensive and didn't even think of apologizing until I said something about him not apologizing for the mixup. In the meantime, we are still waiting for my son's pizza while ours get cold. Customer service is not that important appearently.  Next time we will just pick it up ourselves. Delivery not included!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We came in at sat at a table while we waited for my friend to show up. We waited about 20 minutes and saw the crew nicely handle a lot of customers. They were nice, efficient and did a great job of repeating orders for accuracy. The restaurant was also clean. As soon as my buddy showed up, we ordered our food at the counter. Our order consisted of three mini (8') pizzas:   -One pineapple and cheese -One sausage and mushroom  -One Barro's special  -A dozen medium buffalo wings (traditional) with extra sauce -Three medium drinks  Everything tasted great! If I'm around the area, I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. Pretty busy considering there's another location a couple miles away. Employees need a little more direction. The young girl that brought my food out had a hard time finding me, forgot to bring plates and napkins. The food took longer than normal to come out, too."}
{"text":"Always fresh, hot and delicious. Best LOCAL pizza place in both the east and west valley. Their chicken wings are not only delicious because they're cooked well, but because their sauces are awesome. I love the medium buffalo and BBQ flavor. Ask for extra sauce on your wings to avoid them coming out dry."}
{"text":"I've always loved Barro's. Their lunch specials are awesome. My favorite toppings are pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. The chicken wings are great. I like to get the medium buffalo flavor with extra sauce. Great appetizers and pasta dishes, too."}
{"text":"Fast service, lunch specials are great. Food is fresh and always taste great. My favorite toppings on my pizza are sausage and mushroom with extra sauce. The cheese sticks and chicken wings are great."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup and the person who answered the phone was polite and patient with questions about salad choices.     Arrived at the location and the restaurant was just about empty and some tables hadn't been bussed yet.  The appearance was dirty and if I was eating in I would've just left.   This was kind off putting as there were 4-5 people at the counter bantering it up.  Cool, gotta have some fun at work but yeah, do your jobs maybe?  The pizza just isn't that good.  Thick crust, bland sauce, bland meat.   The positive take away is that it was hot.  The Salad we ordered was the lamest looking bag type of salad.    weh weh weh wehhhhh."}
{"text":"Second time they've failed me. Was so excited one opened up in my neighborhood but not so much. Twice both carryout and delivery my order was wrong. Extra sauce means no sauce and extra crispy mean barely done. I've been eating at the thunderbird location for 15 years never had an issue but both times they screwed it up here.  When I came for carryout I watched employees dancing with each other while food sat on window, saw one girl grab a pizza , with cheese hanging off the side, take it to a table as toppings and cheese were dropping on the floor. I won't be back and I'll never get the 80 dollars I've wasted here back either"}
{"text":"Really Barros. I live 5 minutes away and it takes you an hour to deliver a large pizza, wings, and a 2 liter.  Oh wait. You didnt deliver the 2 liter did you.  It was nice that you were going to send another delivery guy out to bring it.  Oh!  He never showed up.  Not that I'm pissed about the few bucks, but really?  Your service and delivery suck!"}
{"text":"I was a regular for the $10.99 one topping.  Now the deals off and the last time I ordered they delivered an original crust instead of thin(my usual).  That was my last time unless the price goes back down.  Decent pizza for 10.99.....over priced at $14"}
{"text":"So instead of the regular Friday Papa Johns pizza for dinner, we decided to give this place a try!  Location & Aesthetics - located on W Greenway Road by the corner of N Reems and W Greenway by the Walmart Neighborhood Market. Parking was a bit difficult to find as the parking lot is shared with part of Walmart Neighborhood Market, and it was a Friday evening.  The restaurant was clean on the outside and inside.  The restaurant (eating area) itself is spacious however the area where you order at the checkout immediately upon entering is a bit limited in terms of space. As we entered, there was a lot of people waiting around - some waiting for their orders that was placed, some picking up their orders, some who can't decide what to order and are looking at the menu, some in line, and some who can't decide what place they are in line. There is a three-seater bench/chair with two extra single chairs placed in the waiting area in case you wish to sit and wait for your order which nobody was really taking advantage of. The place was hopping which ought to tell you something!  Menus - the menu was self-explanatory and up on the wall.  Very easy to read.  Plus there are copies of the menu on the counter top in case you want to grab one and have a more in-depth perusal.  Service - We were there to place an order to go as when we attempted to call prior to place the order, we encountered an error message on the phone.  Thankfully there were 3 cashiers on deck trying to whittle down the crowd milling around at the checkout/cashier area, and they were working fast and efficient to take orders.  Despite the craziness of it being a Friday evening, they were very friendly, patient, and answered any questions we had. I asked about the phone situation and was told that on Friday's, their phones can get busy as they have 5 lines and they do get filled up quickly so it's best to keep trying and hope that you get through. The cashier even offered us water while we waited for our order!  Food - We order the large chicken supreme (Chicken, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Onions, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese) with a side of 12 wings.   With the 12 wings, you can't mix-and-match however with the 24 wings you can which was no biggie.  The 12 wings was ordered as mild but still had a little kick to it which again wasn't a problem for me.  The wings were hot, juicy, well seasoned, flavorful, and very tender (not too tough) to work off the bone.  You do have a choice of original (bone) or boneless. The pizza pie was heavenly!  The pie was piping hot and pulling it apart, one can see the beautiful strings of cheese attempting to hold itself to the pie. The crust/dough was soft, buttery and moist, and not very dry.  The pie had lots of cheese, and adequate and equal amounts of ingredients on each slice.  The chicken was well seasoned, soft and tender.  The ingredients like the green peppers, onions, and mushrooms tasted fresh!  I think I've found our new go-to place to order pizza from now!  Absolutely love the food and their service!"}
{"text":"Really love this Barro's! The staff is always very friendly and efficient, the pizza is always great... they are never stingy with the cheese or toppings. Plus the location is right next to my neighborhood, so it makes it super easy to stop by on our way home."}
{"text":"Great pizza! It's always better when you get a whole pizza rather than a couple of slices that have been sitting in the warmer for awhile. That being said, the reason for the 2 stars is that the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. Today my boyfriend and I went there and greeted the cashier with a smile and a \"hey how's it going\" and she responded with nastily coughing into her elbow and completely ignored our greeting. Everything she said was short and rude, no eye contact, and terrible vibes all around..I know customer service isn't the most exhilarating thing in the world but I work in the service industry and even when I'm having a bad day I still know how to put a smile on my face, ESPECIALLY when the guest is being friendly and polite. This cashier has dirty blonde hair, and I believe a few colorful streaks through out it. She should be fired. Every interaction I've had with her has been extremely unpleasant."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and consistent overtime we order from there.  Have eaten there maybe 30 times in the last few years, and of course had a couple issues, but they are quick to go above and beyond to fix.  It is impressive when a company works so hard, recognizes when they mess something up, and are so willing to solve it in my (the customers) favor.  The food is also very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! My go to pizza place over anywhere else! Great kids working for them too! Always smiling and kind to customers!"}
{"text":"Had not had them in a while they we're great then and still great now placed a delivery order received my one topping large Plus 24 Wings Within good timing everything was fresh and hot wings had a good amount of sauce also pizza was cheesy goodness will continue to order from them FYI go online for deals"}
{"text":"After ordering a pizza for delivery and the price wasn't what we thought it was going to be... We canceled our order. Although afterwards a pizza showed up at our door which you made me and my roommate fight. She threatened to throw me out and we never put an order in neither did I give her a credit card number who her to run. They showed up with one pizza when we ordered two pizzas and wings how is that even possible.... thanks love Barro's now I may be homeless just because of you"}
{"text":"This is the best gluten free pizza I have ever had. There is some sort of spice in the dough that makes it taste very unique. I order it at least once a week. I must say that I am a bit embarrassed to call since they identify you by your phone number. I always order the same thing. I gave it a four star since there seems to be an inconsistency on how much the dough is cooked from time to time.   The play area is fun for the kids too. A few moms and I head over one day a week for lunch. It is a nice day out and they have good price pizza specials!"}
{"text":"It is rare when you find a place where the service is as good as the food. In particular, the wings are hands down the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  From a chain.  Shocked me.  The only way to get a pizza that isn't completely AMAZING back in CT or NY is to go to a chain restaurant.  The wings are ok.  Most places have bad wings.  These are just ok.  Which is kinda bad, because wings are expensive.  Oh well, have the pizza.  It's in the name of the restaurant.  Thanks for the celery.  That's a requirement!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at this Barro's pizza. I am a huge fan of Barros and eat lunch at the one in Moon Valley about once a week. I had to come down to Gilbert for business so I decided to get my favorite lunch. They have the best prices for a quick lunch. My Barros in Moon Valley has a salad bar and super hot fresh pizza every time I go. Unfortunately this Barros does not even compare. This Barros is dirty, the staff is so rude and I had hair in my pizza. The young lady behind the counter could care less we were there. My pizza was cold, and she piled 3 pieces of pizza on top of each other and just handed to me. No asking if I wanted napkins or utensils (and none given). None of the tables were clean and old stinky food was lying on the counters after lunch service (it was 3:00PM). To top it off, as I am eating my cold pizza, I eat a hair which is clearly not mine! Ugh!  I won't be back to this Barros. Don'twaste your time because you are certainly wasting theirs!"}
{"text":"The staff here are ALWAYS friendly!  We leave near this place and eat here often with our children.  I wish I knew the name of the young man that is often there, but he is always so friendly.  We were in this week and a new employee helped us and once again very nice.  I knew then I should write a review.   The tables are quickly cleaned off, and the restaurant appears clean.  I wish the patio was a little more welcoming...for I love to sit outside.  The Barros special is the BEST!  Our family eats here on our family pizza night"}
{"text":"Barros is a great \"go to\" for quick, but delicious pizza. Better than most of the chain places in the valley & their service is normally friendly.  As far as food, pizza is great & I like the style of crust that they use. Not too tough, but not too thin (Im not a huge fan of cracker style). We usually get the classic pepperoni pizza & a side of breadsticks with cheese.  This time we actually stopped in for a simple order of wings-- teriyaki & medium. Both sauces were very flavorful & our wings were juicy, cooked just right! We also ordered a side of the breadsticks with cheese (a favorite from Barros).  The restaurant wasnt busy at all, so our service was prompt & friendly."}
{"text":"I love that this place has Gluten Free pizza."}
{"text":"Walked in today and right off the bat the whole place smelled pretty funny like they've been cleaning the counters with the same old rag for days. Paying no mind to the smell I ordered my number four combo and it was fine but after I finished my meal I got up and was greeted by a half dollar sized roach going back and forth between booths looking for an easy meal."}
{"text":"Love this place for pizza and constantly go for the 2 for 19.99 deal.  If I go for a specialty pizza it's the mega meat.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of barros. As of lately it seems like the food quality is dwindling. Went here last Friday and ordered food. Sat down and it took 10 minutes to get my beer. Once I got my beer it was frothy and tasted gross as it was the last one on tap. I swapped it for a coors light which was also watered down. The wings were dried out. The pizza was luke warm. Really disappointed! Also the place is filthy. The high chairs are so gross I have to personally wipe them down. When I wiped out table down there was a brown layer of dirt on the baby wipe"}
{"text":"Update: This company is clueless when it comes to dealing with customers. My previous review, in which I recounted how I was treated like a criminal who prints fake money, was responded to by Barro's, requesting I email my contact information. I emailed them twice, and they have yet to respond.   Why ask for my information if you are not going to actually contact me about the issue? This company needs to get their customer relations together, because this has been pathetic."}
{"text":"I've not been to visit Barros since the move to Phoenix. However i did work for the Barros gang in California. I believe the original was in hacienda heights. I managed the Reseda California store for quite a few years.......if the pizza is anything like the original.....mmmmm near perfection"}
{"text":"I called and ordered delivery (I live about 10min away) and was forced to repeat myself several times because the girl who answered the phone was trying to multi task by listening to people in the background. After finally placing my order (one large pizza and a side salad) I was told it would arrive within the hour..... One hour and 15min later, I call back to check where the driver is at, and they said \"the driver left seven minutes ago; we were about an hour and half to two hours out) which was not relayed to me. Luckily, the driver was smart enough to call me when she was near; however; there aren't many things that are more annoying than false delivery times. The driver arrived and just said \"sorry about that\". My pizza was cold and the salad was warm. I can handle the wait, as long as the food is enjoyable. This missed the mark"}
{"text":"First time to Barro's Pizza and most disappointing time. I had a coupon for one large one topping pizza which I thought was a nice gesture from Barro's to send me this coupon. The coupon states dine in and take out only and no delivery which to me meant I can order over the Internet and pick it up, hence take out. When I showed up to the restaurant they told me they couldn't take the coupon because I ordered it online and paid for it. No where on this coupon says no online orders so I thought I was safe, boy was I fooled. I would appreciate it when places hand out coupons they would go by what the coupons says and not make up some other criteria on the fly. As for the pizza it was ok a bit greasy I would say. So if you're into greasy pizza and false advertisement then this is the place for you :)."}
{"text":"We don't come here all the time, but I like this place. The \"thick crust\" pizza is hand-tossed and has a thicker crust (not Chicago style deep dish, but thick). It comes out crispy on the outside while being chewy on the inside. They use quite a lot of cheese... Awesome! This is the kind of pizza that you should put \"stuff\" on and eat with a fork. Sure, you could go cheese-only, but a crust like this begs to be topped with everything. In my experiences, they are pretty generous with their toppings.  They also have a thin crust option, pasta, wings, and sandwiches, but I've never tried them.  The place is very popular with families and children's sports teams, so it can get crowded and noisy at times. That's when you activate the \"To Go\" option.  At lunch time, they have very reasonable slices specials: one slice and a drink, two slices and a drink, one slice, a salad, and a drink, etc."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that I even have to yelp this.  I love Barro's pizza and wings, who doesn't?  By far the worst experience ordering a simple pizza!  I've attached a photo of our receipt for proof the address is blacked out for safety. We ordered delivery at 3pm with an hour lead time. At 4:05pm I called to see where are pizza was at??? They had the order for pick up, granted the manager told us the order would be remade and delivered to us in 30 minutes. When our food arrived it was the same pizza and wings from 3pm just heated up. Ugh."}
{"text":"Barro's  pizza  left Illinois like 35 years ago , it was my favorite pizza then and also my high school hang out in Palatine , saying that I wasn't aware that this was the same Barro's but a little investigating and sure enough it is . I have to save I am a happy man as this is exactly like I remembered it back then and I couldn't believe the price as it was really cheap compared to Chicagoland pizzas  but I'm happy to say I'm retiring to This area in a couple years , just hope I don't get too heavy eating here too often."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town! Great crust and great marinara sauce. The wings are very average. Good wing sauces, but under baked for wings."}
{"text":"Its sad when many Americans are struggling they go and raise prices on a staple and wonder why on a Sunday Night there are only 2 customers.  You would think with a group of restaurants they have they would want to do Budget Buddy's like Uncle Sams's does. Guess 20 years of patronage counts for nothing.   Sad sad sad"}
{"text":"Great Pizza but Not  Second Amendment Friendly  In this area and the free range crack heads I will laugh when they get held up  But  \" No Guns\" is OK  The fat balding manager is  jagoff  Good pizza"}
{"text":"Food is always good but ordered pizza with ranch and cheesy bread (which SHOULD come with marinara) but when i got my food i had two ranches and no marinara so i asked a girl named erin i believe if i could get my marinara and she told me it was going to be an additional .50 and i said i would really like some marinara and then proceeded to take a ranch off my plate (that i paid for), grabbed a marinara and then threw it on  our table and walked away...did not appreciate that what so ever"}
{"text":"From out of town - came in to visit family.  First time here.  Ordered bbq wings - seemed a bit dry - good flavor though.  Ordered 6 mozzarella cheese sticks - ok for the price.  Had special barro's pizza thin crust.  Very good.  Glad we got the thin.  Veggies on pizza done perfectly - not over cooked.  Will be back!  Value seemed good!  $30 for 3 of us with 2 beers.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Barro's in years and it was just as good as I remembered. So yummy! They also have really great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great pizza and easy pick up for carry out service."}
{"text":"Best pizza I ever had hands down!  Crust is super thick and the cheese is amazing.  Wings are great too.  Wish they had some dry-rub favors but the teriyaki is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I got both traditional and boneless wings. The sauce is about as generic as I've had.  Boneless wings had some of the toughest chicken breast I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Barro's has always been my favorite place to get pizza. The food is always good no matter what location I go to, but I WILL NOT come back to this Barro's in Gilbert. I came here and ordered a lunch special and received nothing but eye rolls and low quality customer service from young cashiers. I get the hesitation in providing quality customer service to a customer who is being difficult, although my requests were simple. I ordered the 2 slices and salad lunch special and stopped the cashier after he pulled out the already made salad to let him know if I could get this order to go. I received no response and attitude as he put the salad back in return for a salad that was packed to go and finished the transaction. After getting a drink I came back asking where they kept their forks. A young girl walked over to what looked like used forks then walked back to the kitchen as she ignore me while I was politely telling her I needed a plastic fork (I would assume she would know as she clearly saw I had a TO GO order in my hands). She came back from the kitchen with silverware and asked her again if I could get a plastic fork. Once again, no response, attitude, walked back and got me a plastic fork.   During my time here, young employees were talking about personal matters; not ideal for the work place where customers first walk in. This is very disappointing in a business if customer service skills like this are acceptable. Please go else where."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and called Barros for delivery. ( we have tried 4 local pizza shops and Barros is our favorite) They took our order but immediately called us back to say they were outside of their delivery area BUT DELIVERED IT ANYWAY!!! This mom ( who just spent all night at urgent care with one child & came home to 3 more hungry children) couldn't be more impressed or thankful!! THIS Barro's IS AWESOME and their staff is the absolute best. If you want GREAT PIZZA AND AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Like my last review states, I really like their sausage! I also like their lunch specials! I must say that there is an employee that works there (an older lady with short hair) who is just a crank. She ruins the experience. It is unfortunate because we go there often and every single time she is so unfriendly it is awkward. It was interesting that I was at a party and they ordered Barro's pizza from this location, and the people that ordered the pizza were talking about the same lady. So it's not just me who thinks she needs to go to \"friendly school.\" She is not an asset to this company. She must be related or be one of the owners. I don't know why else she would still be employed. LADY:  SMILE and PRETEND you like customers!!"}
{"text":"We like Barro's!! We really like their daily lunch specials (even on weekends) and their salad bar!! Our favorites are the buffalo chicken pizza and the BBQ chicken pizza!! Their sausage is superior to many other pizza places!! I am very picky about my sausage so, trust me, I know the difference between crap sausage and quality sausage that Barro's serves!  We USED to go to the other location, but one sour puss employee ruined our dining experience every time, so we now travel a couple extra miles to this location where the employees are super friendly AND the food is good!!"}
{"text":"Were the ambiance of this place better, I would have been quite impressed. The meatballs I ordered were a bit under seasoned but were of decent quality and served with lots of cheese and adequate if also under seasoned sauce. The salad bar was small and uninspired. However, the veggies were fresh. The blue cheese dressing was restaurant grade. I guess it was the overall deafness plus the meaningless chatter on the television that left me underwhelmed. Anyway, if needs be while waiting for my car to be serviced, I would return."}
{"text":"Once again I found myself taking us to Barro's for the lunch specials.  Great specials and good food what else can I say.  Thought I was done didn't ya, I think they need to expand their drink variety just saying sprite and lemonade gets old when your looking for non caffeine stuff."}
{"text":"I just picked up an order for a thin crust 2 item pizza. When I got home I couldn't eat it  because it was so salty. It tasted like somebody just took a salt shaker and opened up on the pizza. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Before reaming these guys, I will start by saying I really appreciated the Friday night quick delivery and thought the wings were good.  With that said...  If you like thick doughy pizza, defrosted translucent-wilted salad, and rude customer service from a manager by the name of Kendra, then BOY do we have a pizza place for you.  Pretty much, everyone knows that salad is one of the riskiest items on any menu, being one of the biggest bacteria carriers.  Our disappointment with this order began with what we found in the garden salad container.  My wife, being ServSafe certified, noticed a significant portion of lettuce (which seemed to have been frozen and thawed) which was translucent and visually unappealing.   We've posted the photos so you can see for yourself, but unfortunately Yelp removed them on 12/14/12 because \"...your photos looked more like they captured your personal experience\".  Umm k.  My wife phoned to bring this to the attention of a manager.  She politely explained that they may want to check their salad, to keep other customers safe, and requested a refund (for the price of the salad only).  I listened in, and can confirm how polite she was.  The manager, Kendra, wanted to give us credit instead.  My wife explained that we don't plan on ordering from Barro's in the future, and would just like the salad price refunded.  The obviously annoyed Kendra replied \"OK!\" and then hung the phone up.  No apology, no thanks for reporting potentially out of temperature food.  Nothing but the echo of a dial tone in our receiver.  The pizza tasted good, but the texture is accommodating to those who prefer a thick and doughy crust.  There are too many other pizza places to put up with potentially tainted food and substandard customer service.  No thanks Barro's."}
{"text":"I have not had Barro's Pizza in over 14 yrs and I took my wife and daughter a couple weeks ago and it's still the same, very good.  We had the combo pizza and a dozen teriyaki wings.. excellent. .. the ambiance and decor were right on.. lots of tv's....we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Their pizza isn't always fantastic if you order a lunch special but thats to be expected since it is a lunch special and it's not cooked right when you order it.  My last visit there was pretty bad, as I was halfway through eating my meal, I noticed a couple of cockroaches under a table a few seats down from me.  1 cock roach was dead, the other one was hanging out with his dead buddy.  Needless to say, I may have overreacted a bit, but my food just began to taste awful (Yes I know thats just in my head) and I had to throw my food away and leave.    I'm sure they'll improve next time but I don't feel as though I'll be returning for a little while."}
{"text":"I really like Barro's, but let me tell you my boyfriend LOVES IT. Whenever we go to AZ Barro's pizza is what's for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But it's a good thing because the pizza here is great! I have not tried anything else on their menu besides the pizza and side salads but the food always tastes fresh and yummy. The staff here are always on point. They are very attentive but also competent. The food comes out very quickly and in my experience the food is always fresh and warm, straight from the oven. Check out this location especially during lunch because they have a lunch special that is cheap."}
{"text":"I love the great pizza and eat there few times a month. I went to pick up a pie on the way home and was given the wrong pizza. I got home and noticed an when I went to call they called me already. I talk to Rexan and he said sorry and sent my pizza for delivery and it was as my house within 10 min. Thank you for fast service and taking care of us.  Brittiny and Eli"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. I won't slander this place because I have another pizza joint that is #1 to me but, this place is a close #1 because the quality of food is close to one of my other establishments. Definitely nice for a change up on this place though."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Barro's for many years, and I can probably accredit that to their slogan, \"a family tradition\".  Their friendly and speedy service of their piping hot pizzas and wings, all made using fresh and high quality ingredients is likely to have you coming back time and time again.    The ambiance is exactly what you would expect from a family pizza joint, great smells, sports to watch, and a place to park your seat just in time for you to enjoy a cold brewski and some hot wings!    In my experience it is hard to find a place that does both pizza and wings well, and Barro's has you covered!  If you are looking to get both while you are here, ask the cashier if they have any combo specials to save you an extra buck or two!"}
{"text":"When my mom still lived in Phoenix, this was our go to pizza delivery place, and we always got the same thing.   Pizza with double cheese, and barbecue chicken wings.   I never said it was healthy.   But it was yummy."}
{"text":"Pizza here is always fresh and a great family place. Weekends are a little crowded but pizzas seem to go out quickly. This place is a great value and good food. Servers go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"It all started when I was a little kid playing soccer in Moon Valley. When our soccer season was over for the year we would always have a party at Barros pizza at the Moon Valley location to celebrate and receive trophys and eat pizza. To this day I am still a true Barros pizza fan and I frequent this location quite a bit. Thanks guys for always being my go to place for pizza!"}
{"text":"As far as barros go. This is the best one. Pizza is always fantastic. Delivery is quick! Going in for lunch they usually always have pizza hot and ready. If it's not ready the wait is always less than five minutes. Lady who works the front is awesome. Always fast and easy and remembers a lot of people."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.... every time we go there the staff is so pleasent. Weather we have it delivered or go for the lunch specials with the salad bar which is all quality ingriedients,  best pizza we've found since we moved here.  Thank you for being the bomb digitty 10 stars"}
{"text":"I have to say the pizza was average to good but the wings were not good. The service is poor. The girl acts like you are bothering her by coming in. Had to get my own napkins anf bus the table before sitting. I won't mark them down for having no A.C. mechanical problems happen but being some fans in or something."}
{"text":"Order from this Barro's on a regular basis, but the quality continues to decline. Here is a picture of what they are serving up. Not very appetizing. Will have to find a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Very timely, always clean and friendly staff. Saturday night call in order wait time was at least 4-6mins till order was taken. Still yummy pizza and they offer GF."}
{"text":"There is only one pizza that I like better than Barro's Pizza and that's Valentino's in Nebraska. Most Nebraskan's will tell you the same thing - that Valentino's is hands down the best pizza there is. Maybe it's because we cut our teeth on it. Anyway, since I can't get that here, Barro's is the next best thing and I'm thrilled that we finally found it.  We have tried all the pizza places in Anthem & north Phoenix and Barro's is always the one we agree has the very best pizza. Why do we sometimes go elsewhere? Convenience. We don't live in Anthem so there are times when it's just too far to drive when you're hungry and other times making the drive isn't an option.   I love the regular crust pizza with pineapple & jalapenos while my husband prefers pepperoni & jalapenos on his. Barro's uses good quality ingredients and their pizzas always have the perfect cheese/sauce/topping ratio. The crust is cooked to perfection, never doughy or burnt - just right.   Whether we dine in or carry out.the service is always fast and friendly and this restaurant is always clean.   When it comes to pizza in the valley, Barro's serves the best!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for a great lunch special during the week. You can get two slices and a drink for just under 5 bucks. You can choose between cheese, pepperoni, sausage or Hawaiian I believe. They may have a veggie option in there too, I'm not sure. Pizza is decent too, tasty and no tiny ripoff slices.   Not sure how the pricing goes for full pies/weekend or dinner crowds but as far as lunch does, this place is spot on."}
{"text":"I won't give it the \"best pizza\" in town... But it sure out beats a lot of them! We order the thin crust pepperoni/sausage and a 25 hot wings .. Good prizes.. Fast service and friendly staff.. Which always helps me decide if I will return. We have ate here a few times now and we will continue to come back"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst location I've ever had at Barros pizza... keep in mind I always love Barro's pizza but will not be back this time.  Called in and instantly placed on hold for over 5 minutes just to place an order.  Figured I had been forgotten about so I hung up called back and couldn't get a word out before being placed on hold for another 2 minutes.  Anyways, pizza is delivered and I give the driver $30 on a $22 bill just to find we are missing 3 items and a marinara sauce with our cheesy bread.. keep in mind Barro's Pizza charges for each individual ranch and we had ordered 3 of them.  I called in not being upset at this point asking if we could be reimbursed and the girl relays my message to the manager and says they will reimburse $5 on my next order... that's got to be the worst deal I've ever seen as I had already paid $2 for the ranch and tipped the driver $8 and they never showed up and ruined our meal. Just all around worst customer service I've ever had at this location... on another visit and different day they had all of their beer taps not working and pouring straight foam... it has to be the worst location in all of Phoenix... this is my first yelp review I've ever left and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! I missed their Diamond Bar, CA location and was surprised to find them in AZ!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Wings are the best, my favorite are the mild boneless wings! Pizza is worth the price and always fast speedy service especially when ordering on the phone. Thin crust pizza is amazing and all of the specialty pizzas are amazing, the kona pizza is the best one!"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent, as well as the boneless wings.  Delivery is awful.  We live less than 5 minutes down the road, and they will tell us anywhere from 1 hour to 1.5 hours.  The last time we got delivery it was 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  Recommendation: carry-out or dine in...DO NOT get delivery."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza. Salads are a little disappointing but what you might expect from a pizza place. The delivery time is always super long and they usually take a little longer than they estimate. I get that they have busy times but it always takes 1-1.5 hours to get one pizza and we live less than a mile away. If you don't mind the wait, the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Barros pizza is average. However, this review is about the kid unfriendlyness of Barros(no kid menu? really?) and the sloppiness of this particular Barros and its number of dirty and unbussed tables. The highchairs were disgusting and the staff seemed only to care about takeout pizza. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Went there with friends and I was not impressed at all. While the service was friendly, the food we had was absolutely terrible. No wonder the dining room was empty while we were there. If you want gourmet pizza, go to Lamp at Pima and Pinnacle Peak! Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"We love Barros!! Usually go to other locations around the valley but decided to go to the one on Ray because of where we were at. Great service!! Lady was extremely nice! However this location is the dirtiest I have ever seen at barros. We were the only 6 people in the restaurant and very few tables were available that were clean! This restaurant really needs to clean up. Asked for them to clean a table and 15 minutes later a worker came to wipe down our table! Please clean up!!"}
{"text":"Not good wings were not crisply cooked and the sauce was thick and bland. Pizza OK but not cheesy and I did feel sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"I called for delivery to the Holiday Inn, less than a mile away, and the girl on the phone was either stoned or stupid. I repeated my phone number 3 times and she couldn't get it right. I told her I was staying at the HI and she asked for the address so I gave it to her. Then she asks if this is an apartment complex? WTF?!?! NO, IT'S THE HOLIDAY INN!!! Then she wants to know the cross streets and I tell her how the hell would I know I'm staying at the HI, I'm not a local. They can't deliver without knowing the cross streets.... blahblbhalalhalha! I hung up. Get a new phone person!!!"}
{"text":"Timeframe for this visit was in mid April 2018. We'd been staying nearby, having our RV repaired, & I'd been craving pizza for a while, so stopped in at the Surprise location. I'd read some of the other ratings, but we'd had good experiences before with Barro's & opted to try this one. It was about 8:30pm when we walked in. I can honestly say the best part of our visit was the almost depleted salad bar. Food allergies aside, what was left (lettuce, cheese, sunflower seeds, olives) was perfect for me. Hubby & I ordered a half & half pizza -- half meat, half chicken with a garlic white sauce. My half white was OK, but he crust of hubby's half meat was burnt on the outside. No one was cleaning tables as the few patrons left, so all around us was a mess, including floors. They ran out of coke syrup & ice as we were refilling our beverages, which was the last straw. We left with stomach upsets. I sincerely hope things have improved for the better, but suffice it to say we'll never go back there again. You just can't forget a visit like that one."}
{"text":"We ordered a large tomato pie. 40 minutes late, cold, soggy, and it wasn't even cut properly. Pathetic excuse for a pizza, never again!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to come with the GK'S. Food is always great even when it's busy it doesn't really take long to get your food.  TV for the kids,  Sports for the adults.  The kids room is separate from the adult room. Great family restaurant & great for kids team parties."}
{"text":"Love the Barro's special get it delivered at least once a month"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the prior low star reviews also. In terms of chain delivery pizza  places this cant be beat in Phoenix.   I rate this pizza above Pizza Hut/Dominoes/Little Caesars Equal to Streets of New York, NYPD Pizza,  and maybe Pappa Johns Below Spiano's (if you have them near you)"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite pizza places because of the crust.  Nothing says yummy for da tummy like crusty crust that's nice and chewy in the center.  It's thick enough that it doesn't get sopping wet from sauce and juice, yet not so thick you think you just got a mouthful of dough.  I'm a bit of a plainster - the sausage is good enough for me.  Best honey bbq wings I've had, too.  Crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside, and they seem to give me more wing parts than mini drumettes whenever I go there, which I love.  And ooey gooey finger lickin' sauce...that's the stuff.  Just don't order the lunch special unless you know for a fact the pre-made pizza is fresh.  Last time they told me it was fresh I ordered it only to find it dried out from the heat lamp.  Bleh.  Only happened once though in all the times I've gone."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong with the two stars.  I still love Barro's...but this location left something for my tummy to desire...like actual pizza.  After walking down the long miles of Fry's Electronics, it was lunch time and I needed sustenance.  What better place to get it than Barro's with their slice lunch special?  Unfortunately the only slices they had - at prime lunch hour - was pepperoni and a dried sad lone slice of veggie.  At prime lunch hour.  I was one of four patrons at that point and everyone wanted sausage.  If I wanted my yummy Barro's sausage pizza, I would've had to wait 15, maybe even 25 minutes.   At prime lunch hour.  Unnnnggghhh...tummy hurting.  No thanks sucky Barro Thunderbird location.  Boo to you.  :(  Maybe....and I mean MAYBE if I'm in the area I may try this one place again, but for now you did no service to my poor stomach."}
{"text":"Normally excellent service and food! Tonight not so much... was told 20 to 25 minutes for three subs and an antipasto salad. 45 minutes later I get my food, only to get home and missing my salad. Had to go back and get it, and got no apology. Should be careful, there's a new sub shop opening in town."}
{"text":"This barro's location moved from Val vista/ray to Val vista/williamsfield.  I use to love the pizza but recently i have noticed a decline in quality of their pizza--very little sauce on the pizza, the ingredients did not taste fresh. I don't think the decline has nothing to do with the move to a different location."}
{"text":"I'm a transplant to the Phoenix area and had tried a few places before I tried Barro's - I haven't been to any other place since! Fantastic pizza! The sauce is just right... not too sweet and not to tangy. The regular crust is delicious  (haven't tried the thin crust yet,) and the pizza never to greasy. It's loaded with cheesy goodness, and it's not greasy!"}
{"text":"I love Barro's pizza but there are none by my house which is sad.  I was in the area so I stopped in for a pie and decided to try something new.  I ordered the wing pizza which is wing sauce cheese and chicken and it was pretty good.  Barro's always has a great pie and if there was one by my house I would order delivery way too often and probably be 100lbs bigger."}
{"text":"Well not quite awesome but pretty good, no frills pizza. We get pizza there once a month."}
{"text":"I've got to say, this is some good ass pizza!!!! I mean obviously it's not Chicago Giordianos. But this place is amazing. They also deliver!! Whenever I'm in town, this is a must! I am always wishing that we had a Barros here in northern Cali. The cheese and meat combined with a fluffy crust. The service here is great as well. They have a ton of space and a back area for parties. They have like 3 measly games for kids, maybe they should expand for a game room? The chicken wings are pretty good as well. Price is well worth it. Haven't tried anything else other than the wings and pizza. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Barro's Pizza, I always order Barro's Pizza  When I don't feel like cooking dinner. This time I didn't have enough funds for a large pizza, so I Order a small  with some chicken wings and they also  were late. To my surprise they upsize my order to a large I was so excited!!!!!  Usually they are on time with delivery."}
{"text":"Wow. Been going to Barros for 15 years and never again. Wife and I walked in for lunch, each carrying a baby. We asked an employee if we could get 2 high chairs. She then pointed to where those are kept, on the other side of the dining area. Umm thx. So with baby in hand, I went and grabbed one.. took it to my wife so that she could put a baby down.. then grabbed the other one, which was missing a strap. I felt it would have been great if the employee had helped me. Not very welcoming. I will buy pizza elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Stop in on a whim to pick up some pizzas. Got a specialty pizza and some honey hot wings. We even ended up getting a large cheese pizza for $2 since it was a mistake by the cook..so we walked away with a lot of food but were not that impressed. The wings were a huge disappointment for my lova' ( he is a wing man) and they did nothing for him. The pizza was good and settled our rumbling stomach pains but didn't eat leftovers and leftover pizza is one of my favs..for me to pass on it was a sad morning when i usually would have went for that cold pizza which of course, is breakfast of champions.  Wompwomp   p.s it is big inside..good for kids to be loud and run around..tvs and all that..but the food was just meh..."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've found in the area. We typically pick up. Staff is super friendly. If you're ordering from this location, it gets crazy busy on Friday/Saturday nights after 5-6pm. It can be up to an hour wait to pickup a pizza type of busy. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"They are usually pretty good about getting orders accurate and timely but what sets them apart is when a mistake was made they took it upon them self to  make sure we felt ok about the situation and apologized!"}
{"text":"Barro's, its been real.  Real freaking dissapointing the last couple of weeks!  I will never order pizza from this location again (Other Barro's I have no issue with).    The last 2 Friday's (3/4/16 and 3/11/16) we ordered pizza from here.  Both times we got the \"Barro's Special\", and both times, hours later the family had \"stomach issues\".  I don't mind having the shits every now and then.  As they say, \"Shit Happens!\"  What I DO mind though,  is after last nights pizza, my 2 year old son got violently ill and what appears to be food poisoning.  Throwing up and shitting water for going on 12 hours now.  Maybe management needs to check who is working on Friday nights and give them some tips on safe food handling.  No excuse for getting sick 2 weeks in a row.  Never coming back!  It really is sad, too.  We loved getting pizza from this place because of the great prices, friendly staff and consistent quality.  Peace out!  (Me, my wife, and her friend all got sick 24 hours later!)  Never ever going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Just got pizza and wings here for the 2nd time... Pizza is OK but papa Murphy's is way better and our wings were terrible!! We wont be back..."}
{"text":"We discovered Barro's shortly after moving to the neighborhood. The pizza is delicious, Service is fast and polite staff! We love this place and it's in a easy to find location."}
{"text":"Too legit, too legit to quit! The best thing about our extra large pepperoni pizza was the dough! Wow it was really awesome and I wish I could have another slice right now. The pizza came with a meh amount of pepperoni but that cheese and dough saved the whole pie. We ordered cheesy garlic bread that was pretty decent.   Service was good for pick up. They were fast and 20 min wait for the pizza an hour before closing. Not too shabby.   Overall I loved the pie and the all star was that dough! Wish there was more pepperoni. The cheese was so good and thick! Would come back again."}
{"text":"This location is larger than many of the Barrows that I've been to before. It seemed clean and the quality of their pizza was allright. I picked up an order for my stepson. He seemed happy with it, and the price for a large pizza seemed reasonable. I prefer other pizza places but for quick takeout on the way home this suits him."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place for a quick amazing pizza!!! Everybody is always really nice and have great customer service. They always have sports on the tv's and the salad bar is always great. Veggie pizza is always good with the mozzarella sticks on the side. Will always recommend to everyone we know!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza and bread sticks I have ever had.  Better to take it out or have it delivered.  The atmosphere is rough and the salad bar was an afterthought.  But I could eat that pizza again."}
{"text":"So i was in town with a friend visiting her brother in Anthem and we decided to have some pizza and wings delivered,and i have to admit,it is great pizza,i would have to say better then Domino's and Pizza Hut and i might sound crazy but up there with Shakey's Pizza (out here in Cali) .   Tasted their Pepperoni Pizza and Mild Sauce Wings.   The pizza was just yummy,thick with cheese and that pepperoni kick that lacks on others,wings were all drumsticks,no small parts like other chain restaurants have,you know what i am talking about,the side pieces,these were all drumstick's,who does that?   This people do,awesome!   So if your in the Phoenix Area and surroundings,try this spot or their other locations,i am sure it runs in the chain family.   Hope to hit it up soon,maybe around the NFL season!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude, and terrible customer service.  I have ordered from this location twice, both times the service has been shockingly bad.  From the delivery guy who brought me my pizza, to the main reason why I writing this review, the lady who took my order over the phone.  I was appalled at the low level of her customer service and impatience that she had with me and taking my order.  I was a loyal customer until this happened again...change your attitude Barro's, I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I guess taking orders over the phone to make money is a really stressful job."}
{"text":"Since I'm now a gluten free eater my choices for food at restaurants is now limited. I thought I would never get to enjoy pizza again until, I found  that Barro's has a gluten free pizza.  I've eaten quite a few items that are gluten free and were horrible but not their pizza.  You can put whatever toppings you want on it and I have to say the pizza is pretty tasty considering the other options are out there.    Hubby and I have started visiting this location on a regular basis.  The last visit I ordered a pizza and their salad, I forgot to tell them no croutons on the salad, so if you are on a gluten free diet remind them or you will be either picking it all off or ordering a new salad.    Their pizza is pretty inexpensive considering the steps you have to take to make it gluten free.  The staff is always very friendly and we always enjoy sitting and watching whatever sports they have on their tv's."}
{"text":"I got a coupon for a free pizza when I moved here, and I was not disappointed. Delicious pizza! The crust was just perfect and the slices had just the right amount of crunch. We had our pizza to go, but the place was buzzing with patrons. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"They used to get 'boneless' wings wrong over and over and over and over but they got better. The pizza is choice like pizza hut back in the day before all the bs gimmicks and awful ingredient additives.   Barro's is quality chi town cheezeroni you know what i mean? Drop on your favorite zoot suit and head out for a tasty pie!"}
{"text":"30mins to make 2 subs? People waiting everywhere. As we were leaving food is ready don't want it they wrapped it up and gave money back I see a homeless person on the corner I'm sure they will like it"}
{"text":"This time we got delivery.....said it was 45 min....but it came early in 30 min....they LIED! I want accuracy people.  Anywho....had the deep dish pizza half pepperoni and mushrooms....and half bacon and green peppers. They are not stingy on the bacon which made the pizza delicious. This place....second time around...hands down best pan style deep dish around. Of course I will order again......"}
{"text":"Well I be a monkey's uncle....this deep dish pizza is great. We got the meat pizza....deep dish style...wow it was great. These kids sure know how to make a pizza."}
{"text":"Eat in or take out. Haven't been disappointed yet!Best wings hands down. Pizza is awesome, nor skimpy on cheese or meats. We liked the spaghetti too, better without the meatballs though."}
{"text":"This will be my first and last time to this location in Ahwatukee. I called and ordered my pizza at 5:50 I was told it would be 20 minutes. I went to pick up my pizza and it should have been ready at 6:10. I paid for the pizza at 6:15.  At 6:30 the girl at the counter asked me for my name again and then grabbed my pizza out of the counter oven where it was staying warm. I said to the girl behind the counter that that pizza had been there for over 10 minutes, she responded with \"I know\". No apologies. No discount offered for future orders or 2 liters of soda like she promised previous upset guests before me.  This place is a disaster. The girl behind the counter even told one gentleman that she recognized him from before as having had bad service so for him this was two times in a row for him.   Based on that I don't have any desire to return to a place of business that doesn't know how to serve their guests."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this location for about a year and have never been let down! The pizza is very good, a step or two better than the nation chains but what has made this place the reason I created a yelp account was their wings. Sooo good, my personal fav are the sweet red chili. Try them and you will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I love the cheese pizza. All pizza's here are delicious. Try the cold cheese pizza, it's a regular cheese pizza then ask them to top it with cold cheese this will absolutely blow your mind."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and each time was a disaster. The first time I asked what pizza (for lunch) will come out first cuz that's what I wanted- anything that would get me out fast cuz I was in a hurry (they were out of pizza). The lady said all will come out any second, so I chose pep. Twenty minutes later and cheese and sausage came out and other people's orders came out and I'm still sitting there waiting. Second time the lady was so rude! I got mixed up with saying which size drink I wanted and she was so snippy with me when I said I didn't think a 44oz was their large.  no diaper changing station!!!! Ugh"}
{"text":"Expected a Friday night to be busy, and it was to a certain degree. Pick up would be about 30 minutes from the time of order until ready. Went inside at exactly 30 minutes and waited for a few before the pie was ready, I had no issues with that. Additionally, they were friendly and had great product knowledge (from the little interaction I had with them). Pizza was absolutely amazing!!! I was very surprised at how great the pizza was. I'll definitely be ordering from here again! Inside could've been a little cleaner considering there were so many people working this evening. Lastly, hometown Phoenix Suns were playing this evening but college ball was playing on their only TV. GO SUNS!"}
{"text":"They have great lunch specials all around $5 and they have a pretty good selection in terms of their menu. I typically get delivery and anytime they quote me a time they are always on time or early. When they deliver my order is always right and the food is steaming hot. My only complaint is that I pay a $2 delivery charge when I literally live a minute from them. My main reason for delivery is because I have 2 kids and live on the 3rd floor.   Most place that deliver have a free delivery area. I think as close as I am I shouldn't have to pay a delivery fee. Other than that love their pizza and am looking forward to my next order."}
{"text":"We order pizza from here for the last 6 months. I've ordered a sandwich from here twice both time they got it wrong last night they gave me chips that were expired Jan 16.  And one of the pizzas tasted like it had dish soap on it I'm not one for complaining but damn expired chips almost two years old really !   We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"If you're from Moon Valley, you grew up on Barro's! It's always consistent in pricing, and taste. The pizza is just cheap enough for a middle schooler/high schooler to afford without sacrificing taste. Their great for groups, too! The service is always friendly, and it's the most convenient place to fulfill all of your immediate pasta needs! Also, their cheesy bread is always a good go-to."}
{"text":"Nailed it again !!!   Stopped in for a fresh slice, salad and a cold one !!  Welcomed Justin from Seattle and introduced him to our favorite pizza here in hot and sunny Arizona."}
{"text":"This was a unique situation which prompted K & I to visit this location. We had dropped C at a cast party and had a couple hours to blow. We got here around 7:30 on a Saturday night. The place was busy but we still found a table. The counter girl, Carley, was very nice.  I personally like Barro's. C & I ate at the Barro's located at Baseline & Gilbert almost every Friday night for 3 years. C used to race Hot Wheels at a Friday night Hot Wheels event held in that parking lot. The only reason we stopped was because the people who ran the Hot Wheels event shut it down.  Boo. But the pizza was always good and the service as well. Since then, we've been to the locations at Alma School & Guadalupe and Baseline & Rural. Both of these locations provided a decent experience as well. So it was an easy choice when we drove past this location. The pizza did seem to take a bit of time to be delivered to our table but I figured that would be the case since it was Saturday night and in the prime take-out and delivery time. I'm sure our pizza had a lot of competition in the oven. Regardless, we ordered a large house salad to start and a couple of beers so waiting a little really was no problem for us. The salad was typical Barro's. Lettuce, croutons with some shredded Mozz on top. It works as an appetite pacifier. The beer selection was average and our choice was nice and cold. Although our pizza took a little bit longer than normal to come out, when it did it was hot and bubbly. I found this pizza to be the same as most if not all pizza's I've gotten from Barro's, Fine. There was plenty of cheese, sausage and onion which were our toppings. The pizza we got had just the right amount of sauce as well. It was a good pizza.  As strange as it may seem, pizza is so subjective. I don't rate Barro's against other pizza joints because they're not making the same thing. While they might be making Pizza, they're making Barro's pizza. You simply have to try it and see if it's the type of pizza you'll like. I do. I like the crust, I like the sauce and so far, every Barro's I've been to has done a nice job with the toppings. Service may be a bit sketchy, but then again, this is a place that is staffed by mostly 16-19 year old kids. Sometimes you have to cut them some slack. This might be their first job.  Good service, below average house salad, good pizza, great prices. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot to say other than Barro's freakin rocks! Always fast and friendly service. Affordable prices for quality pizza, subs, salads, pastas and anti pasta sides. We were so super happy when they opened the Arcadia location. Previously we drove out of the way but since the pizza was so delicious, we didn't mind the drive. The crust is thick and has a nice crunch on the edges. The sauce is flavorful and tastes fresh. Always plenty of ooey gooey cheese. Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best I have had in AJ and the Wings were very Meaty and Flavorful! The also deliver and daily specials are great, staff and delivery drivers are very nice. Highly recommend this for great pizza!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza!!! Great customer service, felt welcome and appreciated! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Mesa and recently moved back earlier this year. My hubby is a fan of good cheesy pizza, great crust, and great crispy wings. Barros has that and more.  We have been Barro's fans since we first ordered in back in January. They are consistent and always deliver a fresh, hot, product. Everyone is very helpful if its either dine-in, take-out, or delivery. Thank you Barro's!"}
{"text":"I love Barro's Pizza and have been eating there for most of my life. This location is great I love the nice new location and the staff is amazing.   We love Erin.  She is always a pleasure and knows my family very well."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and his whole family. All 8 got food poisoning. 4 different households. My husband got so violently ill that he had to go to the emergency room! We contacted them to let them know and see if we could get some kind of compensation but they never replied. Great customer service! I'm so upset about all this."}
{"text":"Employees had me on hold for 8 mins. All I wanted was a pick up order. When went to pick up the pizza I didn't look at it which I should've while at the store so I go home open the box to find half my pizza topped w thick layer of cheese that I can barely chew yet swallow. Employees maybe felt lazy or idk but this is horrible    Update we went back Round 2 since they gave us a discount from our first visit. Again they made the pizza way to thick in cheese and no crust on half the pizza. Why can dominos make it perfect but not barros?! Smh."}
{"text":"Ordered the Barros special, chicken supreme and the white pizza. It was ok. I would not go back. Save your money."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery & had a mistake. HOWEVER, when we called, we were able to get ahold of the manager right away & WOW did he go above & beyond for us!! He truly cares that every experience is top notch and the best. Even when you order delivery at home, at the busiest time & day (Sat around 6pm) he still wants your experience to be outstanding, thank you to the manager!! I think his name is David."}
{"text":"I usually always get delivery from here & it's very reliable hot & fresh. I ordered for pick up tonight & the staff was very friendly & my pizza tasted great the place was clean."}
{"text":"Love me some Barro's! Meat lovers is my favorite with some wings and hot sauce. Customer service is is always great and the wait time is not bad. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My family had been going to barrows and always ordered the X large pizza with 24 wings special.  The price has always been $29.95.  With tax it was $33.   Saturday Sept 23 my family went and ordered our usual special xlarge pizza and 24 wings.  The total now is $36 with tax.  When i asked about the increase we were told they now charge $3.00 extra for traditional wings (bone-in).   We were not told at time of ordering and when you try to read the menu board it is very small lettering in non contrasting colors (they dont want you to see it).  Also, on this visit we noticed a reduction in the amount of cheese on the Pizza.  We use to love Barrows but it looks like they are skimping on ingredients and charging more.  Perhaps these are the first steps before closing and declaring bankruptcy.  I  guess Barrows has lost these customers.  We dont intend on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and tried it out on moving day and so glad I did. The pizza arrived hot and fresh. The wings were a great treat as well. Cheese sticks were really good, they are not all dough with a hint of cheese like you get at other places. Have done delivery and pick up and never had any issues when calling in an order."}
{"text":"Barro's is absolutely the best pizza here in Arizona. Its hand tossed crust is just like fresh bread delicious . Some pizzas I'll leave the crust but with Barros sometimes I eat it first and use it to dip and dressings or spices. Topping, Italian sausage is the best I've ever tasted pepperoni is good with lots of fresh veggies available also. Good salad bar, great prices on Pizza pieces, salad and drink combos at lunch. Owners are conscientious and care about the business, just a great place to go for pizza."}
{"text":"Just yum! I usually do not like pizza from anywhere but this is the only place I will now eat it from! Very affordable lunch deals to! I got 6 wings a slice of pizza a drink and a saad for 10$ ! Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Barros Pizza franchise for more than 5 yrs. Love their pizza and wings! This location is one of my favorite ones because its close by in the North side. Always enjoyed the food and customer service. One day I had a bad order, I called and spoke with the manager Brian. I explained to him about how dissappointed I was with pizza and wings (Always had a great order). He apologized and compensated me for most of the order. I gotta say that was above and beyond excellent customer service. I highly reccomend coming to this location. Great pizza, awesome wings and excellent management. Keep up the good work Brian"}
{"text":"We stopped in while we were out for a motorcycle ride. I wasn't really sure what to expect but we were happy when we got our food. We had pepperoni and half black olive, half green olive. The pizza was great and the crust was delicious. I also saw a tray of wings go by that looked fantastic and made me wish I would have taken advantage of the special. (X-large pizza and wings $26)   The price was right too! Just over $22 for 4 of us to eat. Sure beats Micky D's that shares the parking lot. I am looking forward to trying the location closer to home."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza tonight, thin crust mega meat and breadsticks with cheese. We had this delivered. We have ordered from Barros many times but we usually pick it up and I usually get thick crust. The pizza was only warm when it arrived and the crust was flat out awful. I don't know if it was undercooked or if that was normal but it was gross. The breadsticks were definitely undercooked. We were very disappointed with this pizza and most likely I won't order it again. We have had good pizza in the past and may go in but I definitely won't have it delivered in the future."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and have your pizza delivered. The location is sketchy at best, but they have decent pizza and excellent prices.  Barro's doesn't skimp on sauce or toppings.  The cheese bread sticks are awesome, as are the dessert bread sticks....so I have been told. ;)  Delivery is quick and they get the order right.  That makes Barro's A-OK with me!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, I would eat there regularly. I moved away but still come back to eat here until today. This was the worst experience I've had with Barros and sadly I won't return. Whomever is running their kitchen now must have gone home for the day because I feel like I've been waiting hours for my food. They used to be quick, attentive and friendly. Sad to say they've lost their touch."}
{"text":"Look, it's by no means \"chicago-style\" pizza, but hey, it's excellent pizza. They get all the ingredients right, resulting in a damn good slice. And $4.50 for two slices is excellent. Never a wait, interesting toppings for the walk up slices. Great place to stop in for a slice, 5 stars"}
{"text":"Nice pizza.  Good crust and everything was fresh.  Wings were on the small side but the flavor was decent.  Not too loud, which was great.  We will certainly be back.  Wish they had Tabasco sauce for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Barro's is the best pizza in the valley, and a local chain that made good!  This is a newer and cleaner Barro's than i've been used to going to, so points for that.  The fake brick walls kind of close in on you, so I advise not to ingest any hallucinogens prior to your coming in."}
{"text":"Many people don't know it, but even though Barro's is a chain you'll see in various locations, it's a LOCAL chain, family owned and operated.  They established here in Phoenix circa 1984 (i think it was) and have grown and expanded all over AZ quite successfully ever since.  The best pizza in town, even if service is a little inconsistent."}
{"text":"Overall, I would say they are probably my favorite pizza chain around.  Their pizza, breadsticks and wings are all good and their price is fair.  I consider them to be a much better option over something like Domino's or Pizza Hut, but my favorite pizza in the valley is still Brother's Pizza.  I would definitely recommend checking them out if you are in the mood for pizza.  They are my go-to choice for pizza night!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and wings! Honey hot and the teriyaki wings are my favorite. Friendly service every time you go in, and good delivery service! One of the best pizza spots in the area! They usually have specials too, so I always ask before I order."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time and I always look forward to getting their pizza. It's a clean restaurant with service that at times can be slow but is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome !!!from out of town ordered small salad and medium pizza,excellent . Price was right!! Well definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped going to the Tatum location because the pizza was not good. We decided to to try the new Desert Willow location and it wasn't any better. In fact the crust was extremely soggy and very greasy."}
{"text":"This pizza is so damn good.  And the price is right.  I have a hard time eating here IN the restaurant, because it's so empty.  It feels weird.  But their pizza is so good- loaded with toppings, very cheesy, and soft crust.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I have a question. When I was a kid, we always went to Barro's and at that time everyone pronounced it 'Bear O's,' but now everyone is pronouncing it 'Bar O's.' What's up with that?  But I digress, Barro's is decent cheap pizza. They have smokin lunch specials with a slice going for 1.75$ The pizza is greasy and heavy... nothing artisan or fancy about it, but it's consistently decent. Is this the best pizza place in town? Not even close. Is it decent and cheap? Absolutely."}
{"text":"This Barros Pizza location was truly a disappointment. I went here thinking I was getting great pizza and good customer service, but instead they never followed up on our order and we waited for almost a half hour. So when we checked on our pizza the lady at the front counter said they didn't get a print out of out order. I was like \"what\"? So I finally got to talk to a manager and he said he made the pizza, but the lady delivered it to the wrong table. You see I'm not mad at the mix-up. I'm mad that the lady did not tell us the truth. To me, there is no professionalism there. I would have given a 1, but the manager apologized, so at least it wasn't too bad of an experience."}
{"text":"Barro's is kind of a guilty pleasure for me. An East Coast friend of mine is a bit of an Italian food snob. He deems the local Barro's chain \"ghetto pizza.\" LOL. I've been to this one on T-Bird maybe 40-50 times for slices or a whole pie, and really only had below-average pizza twice, although it certainly wasn't terrible.  This pizza is Chicago thick crust. It's fairly salty and greasy, and has a distinct flavor over other pizza places in the Valley. I've used this location for delivery a few times and had good results, too. But the main parking lot is kind of a mess during the day with so many cars coming in and out. I usually park in the small lot right behind the Circle K off of 26th Ave.  The strip-mall this is located in (next to the Circle K) has some interesting things in it like a smoke shop and used game/movie place."}
{"text":"I use to like Barrows but this location has TERRIBLE service. I have been there twice, both times received unfriendly service. Second visit received the wrong order (twice) and was actually asked, 'Well do you want it?'. Was also charged the wrong amount. No concern or correction from staff of their careless mistakes. Pizza was as greasy as possible with no flavor. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The corner of Rural and Baseline has a problem with new businesses.  Each time one opens, it is either a different version of an existing establishment (Chiptole opens across the street from Q Doba, Circle K opens diagonally across the street from QuickTrip) OR the exact same establishment that semi- or un-successfully existed very close by.  In the case of this review, Barro's Pizza has opened a brand shiny new location about 3/4 of a mile east of one that just closed.  They might call it \"moving\", but for someone who lives nearby it's just annoying and frustrating.  So, this Barro's location is new, but the pizza still sucks.  Overly doughy, soggy in the middle despite being prepared \"double well done\", meat toppings tasting very frozen, sauce tasting very canned.  It's cheap and quick, and they're nice enough.  But the product rivals the Kroger store brand freezer version.  I may try their wings or subs, and I will probably regret it.  I'll update this review if I do.  Boo Barros."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean. The service was a Little's less than desirable. I had to ask for a try to carry my food , silverware then napkins. All of which should be automatic! Pizza wasn't hot so I just took it to go. This one of my fav pizza place first time at this location. I was not pleased .."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza spots since I was about 11 years old in Cave Creek. Me and my buddy would skateboard down to Barro's, grab slice and continue in our adventures. Brings back lots of  feels. I have always been partial to Barro's as I went to school with Michael; Hey Mike!! Long time ago but it was cool to see a family business flourish and now there is one right by my house as a \"grown-up\".   The service is fast and the price is good. I have a weird combo, but man is it good. Pineapple, ham and bacon.   We went to Spinato's about 3-4 weeks ago and it was just crap. Left unhappy with an $80 bill. Go to Barro's and spend $26 and leave happy and full, with extra pizza. So there's and obvious decision, made easier."}
{"text":"Dropped by at lunch starving. Good pizza -- loved the thicker crust. A slice and soda cost only $4. Incredibly cheap. What a deal!"}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic!! Nice people, phenomenal pizza, and great ranch dressing! The salad bar does leave a lot to be desired, but the caliber of the pizza MORE than makes up for it! I am from California and was visiting from Texas, every time I visit this area, this is the FIRST place I go. LOVE THIS PIZZA!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the location and the interior.  The service was horrible and the staff didn't seem to know what was going on.  Maybe there were new employees?  In any case, don't order a thin pizza here and expect to get a thin pizza.  Their thin pizza is like a regular normal crust.  The Kona pizza was terrible."}
{"text":"This joint has the best lunch specials in the area. Many options, all incredibly cheap (i.e. 2 slices of pizza, a very good side salad, and a drink. for $6 tax included), and they are also very fast and efficient in moving the line, which can get quite long. Pizza is very good if not outstanding, salads are great. Now a regular destination in the rotation."}
{"text":"Best Barros I've had in a while. As long as the Maura is working. My food was perfect. Definitely worth the drive from Peoria."}
{"text":"Barro's in general has some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. Speaking to this particular location - the booths could use some work, as they are pretty lumpy and uncomfortable; however, the staff is always really nice and the food comes out very quickly and fresh. The lunch deals are unbeatable."}
{"text":"I'd give 1-2 less star but the truth is I like eating here.  I say 1 less for sure because the last couple of times I ate there I had spaghetti and the meatball was OLD and gross (NOT COOL)!!!   The pizza is real good, the salad is real good but there are a few BIG issues.  #1, is the meatball but I already mentioned that...! FIX IT, don't serve OLD meatballs! That is just SICK!!!  #2, management must lack skills because the cashier's seem to change frequently and I don't blame them for wanting to leave. They work as fast as they can but lines can form quickly there. Many times they're taking orders via phone or seldom cleaning the tables. (Some one needs to teach these kids how to clean a rag and clean a table properly!!!)  Staff properly so they can CLEAN PROPERLY so that other arriving customers can find a place to sit.  #3, since the cashier's are so busy taking orders, ringing people up and seldom clearing (won't say \"cleaning\" because it's NOT clean) the table they seem to run low on the salad area consistently.   I have been eating at Barros for at least 10 years or more. Specifically at the Scottsdale one since it got turned into a Barros from a Bar and because its down the street from my employer.  MANAGEMENT IF YOU'RE READING THIS: Take care of your EMPLOYEES!!! I see the cashier's busting their hump and even the cooks in the back come out all sweaty and you can tell they work their tales off. I also see one of the deliver guy driving a crappy ford escort that looks and sounds like the transmission is about to roll out from under the car.  Your food is pretty decent! As I said, I have been eating from Barros for years! The pizza is good, the \"Hot\" wings are the BOMB and the speghetti is 8 times out of 10 pretty freak'n awesome with the garlic bread!!! BUT for crying out loud, do some research and staff, train and pay your employees properly!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza by the slize for lunch is great and can't beat the price.  Have tried various locations they are all really good."}
{"text":"The wait staff was extremely rude to us when we came in. There was a line of about 9 people and 3 girls standing around and only 1 helping. We watched a lady and her daughter in front of us have a problem because their called in order was never made. I felt bad for them because they obviously came to pick up an order that was neglected to be made for them! And then the girls told us to stand aside while they helped other customers who were picking up. I don't understand why our order couldn't be placed in the meantime? Pretty rude of them. We left and won't be back. Unfortunately, I can't even review the food because we never got any."}
{"text":"Best pizza in The Phoenix area. The location in Surprise has the nicest people working there too! It's always very busy, but when I call in my order, they don't sound rushed or rude, like you can expect at other take out places. They make THE BEST gluten free pizza. But ask them to bake the GF pizza twice, and thank me"}
{"text":"Great pizza and excellent service.  Dough was fresh, sauce had great flavor.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love Barros pizza.  Some locations are better than others.  This one is awesome. Come for the lunch special. 2 slices and a drink.  This is a great place to take the family for pizza as it is no too expensive and is better than the other big chains."}
{"text":"Thick cheesy pizza. The toys keep my kids happy and we love it here. The ranch dressing isn't very good though."}
{"text":"We decided to try Barro's after our gym session and most because we had a free large pizza coupon. It was Friday night and the place was packed!  We did not realize it was a order at the front and pay. Was told that the pizza would take about 25min but everything else would be delivered. We seated ourselves at a table and shortly after was brought our wings and salad.   From the food to the service, everything was great. Very thankful for our free pizza but beyond that we're glad we gave this place a shot. Not sure why the low reviews but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone I know in the Celiac world in Phoenix has been raving about Barro's gluten free pizza so I decided to give it a try. My whole immediate family avoids wheat and gluten; mom, dad, daughter and I, so taking my dad there for an early father's day lunch worked out perfectly.  We visited the one in Ahwatukee on Chandler Blvd, which I think may have been one of the first they opened in Phoenix. A friend of mine worked there in high school when it was just a tiny take out place, and on her first day of work she set accidentally pushed the button that silently alerts the police in case of a robbery. They showed up with guns drawn and I don't think I've let her live that down in the 15 or so years I've known her. I was surprised to see that they have expanded into a full restaurant with a bar - I guess it's been a while since I was last there.  We ordered 2 gluten free pizza's - one white pizza at my mom's request and the second a cheese and salami as dad's choice. With a couple of drinks it came out to about $25...comparable to other places that sell gluten free pizza, but they only offer small gf crusts so you get a bit less for the price.   It took about 20 minutes or so for the food to come out and we were all really excited to dig in when it came out. Their gluten free crust is more of a thin style than some of the others I've tried, and while it was pretty tasty, the edges came out burnt and it was a little greasy for my taste.  Overall I'd say their gluten free pizza is good, but not great. I think I preferred the white pizza since there was just something about the tomato sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of. I think I was so impressed by Spinato's amazing pizza sauce that this just couldn't compare.  Barro's is very clean, comfy and perfect for dining with kids. Not my favorite gluten free pizza joint in the valley, but certainly worth trying again sometime. http://wp.me/pQ3DR-1L"}
{"text":"I needed some food for friends and kiddos so I decided to order some food from Barros.  I'd never been there but drive past all of the time. The ordering was very quick and the cashier was super friendly.  The wait time was average and not a problem.  We ordered an XL Kona pizza, large spaghetti and meatball pasta dish, and a dozen wings with sweet chili sauce.  The wings were incredible as the sauce was great.  They really make sure you get enough sauce which is so nice! The spaghetti and meatballs were good but only came with exactly 3 1/2 meatballs.  Yup 1/2 meatball.  It was actually cut in half. That was disappointing.  But luckily the kids didn't mind.  The pizza was good and the pineapple, teriyaki, and grilled chicken was a tasty combo.  The crust was a little bit thick for my taste but was good.  My guests loved it and I wouldn't be opposed to eating there again."}
{"text":"I was not satisfied with my order at all I got cheese sticks and by the time they got here they were cold plus the salad wasn't even that good. Not doing that again!"}
{"text":"I really like Barros when I'm craving thick crust pizza. The toppings are fresh, and they put a lot on. I really like the chicken supreme and the buffalo chicken one as well. The slices are huge on a large, so even for two people, you will have a ton left over. Never had a bad experience eating here, or carrying out. Everyone's always been very nice and friendly, will be back."}
{"text":"They need better customer service and also taking a break at the front lines is very unprofessional. I thought it was strange. Get it together"}
{"text":"The only reason this place got higher than 1 star is because the food was good. We got here at 6pm, ordered two XL pizzas, an order of wings, 5 drinks and three salad bars. The soda machine had barely any ice in it, and the kid filling it up took 10 minutes to put three bags of ice in it. The salad bar was empty the whole time we were here, so I didn't even get half a salad. It is now 7:48pm and we still have yet to receive all of our food. One pizza is here, but that's after we complained to four different staff members that it had been over an hour since we ordered and didn't get our food yet. I will never EVER come back to this place. I don't care how good the food is, I will never recommend this place to anyone. Terrible service, snotty staff. The owner really needs to be in here and get someone trained, because obviously nobody who works here is."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review ever. I'm clearly not huge on leaving reviews, I typically just stop going to a place if the food and/or service is bad. I also hate reading people's complaints about places, but tonight's Barro's experience was extraordinarily bad and the service and the food were both horrible.  I love(d) Barro's, so much that I would eat Barro's once a week or so. Tonight made me have second thoughts of ever going to Barro's again or at least this location. I placed a phone order tonight, a Sunday, and I knew it would be busy due to football so I opted to pick up my order rather than have it delivered.   My order was simple, a small hot wing pizza and a small salad with no olives. They informed me it would be ready in 30 minutes which is totally understandable. I arrive 30 minutes on the spot and I'm told it will take another 10 minutes. This does not bother me one bit, I understand how hectic pizza joints are during football season.  What gets me is that the girls at the front had someone they know come in while I was waiting and paid all of there attention to this friend of theirs. An alleged \"new\" girl was scrambling to find my salad after my pizza came out. 10 more minutes of this poor girl searching for my salad and the other girl apologizing for the \"new\" girl instead of helping her out is inexcusable and it's exactly what happened. Instead the girl at the front wanted to laugh and joke with this person she knew about who knows what while taking her order and allowed her coworker to fend for herself.  At this point, I just want to get home to catch the game. I leave and when I get home, I open the bag my salad is in and in Sharpie it's clearly written \"no olives\" but to my surprise, the salad has olives. This may seem like no big de, but I happen to have an allergy to olives and when I ask for a salad with no olives that's what I expect, especially when someone wrote \"no olives\" right on the box. On top of that, they didn't include the extra ranch I had asked for with the hot wing pizza and the pizza itself was severely undercooked, so much so that the dough itself tasted raw.   Sorry Barro's, I will not return to this location. I may try another location but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this particular location. Food is always good and delivery time is what I would expect."}
{"text":"This review is only on delivery and customer service.   I live in Oklahoma, though I grew up in the valley, and grew up on Barro's Pizza. My kids are in AZ visiting grandma for the summer, and I wanted to surprise them and order pizza for them after a long day at the pool. I called Barro's and explained what I wanted to do. The girl that helped me was super friendly and said it was no problem. I told her how much I wanted to add for gratuity and that all I wanted was for someone to be able to sign for the order. She said \"no problem\" and even asked if I wanted to include a message. She was great.   The pizza arrived within 40 minutes and my kids were super surprised and called to tell me how delicious it was. They got my message and said the driver was really nice and told my daughter all she had to do was sign the credit card slip.   The order couldn't have gone any smoother. I am so happy that my favorite pizza place could help me treat my kids! They were so great!"}
{"text":"Can you say AMAZING! I have been looking for a really good pizza place since we moved to the PHX area over 2 years ago. Unfortunately we did not try Barro's until a week ago, but we will be back. The pizza was amazing (and all we got this first time was pepperoni and cheese). We also ordered the mozzarella sticks and boneless bbq wings. The fact that the marina sauce was chunky showed the attention to detail they have at this place and the focus they put on getting you the best food possible. Everything was delicious and amazing. The pizza had that made from scratch melts in your mouth flavor and that I have not had since the mom and pop place I grew up with in Ohio. I am so glad we found Barro's and the fact that they have an app that we can order through is definitely not waistline friendly. Great place and can't wait to order again. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot especially for lunch! Lunch Special menu almost everything is under $5. The family seating/games are separate from a quieter area when you first walk in. The pizza and wings are delicious. It is a new location and kept very nice/clean. Staff friendly, lunch came quickly. I also appreciated the freshly brewed unsweetened flavored tea."}
{"text":"They have great priced lunch specials which is the only time I go there. My friend and I usually get the pizza and drink special, sometimes with the salad.  The salad bar is okay.        Last week my friend decided to mix it up and try the Meatball Sandwich. She asked how many meatballs you get on the small size and the counter girl went back and asked. She said it has one and a half meatballs on it. Well, they could practically call it a marinara sandwich, because it had ONE meatball on it, (slightly larger than a golf ball),  which was sliced in half and swimming in marinara and melted cheese (one and a half-- or one in half?)  A meatball sandwich with ONE meatball...won't be ordering a sandwich again."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza!  Been coming here for about 2 years now and have never been disappointed. Yummy thick, bubbly crust...mmmm.   Staff are some of the friendliest I've experienced anywhere. Very accommodating and personable. Highly recommend this pizza and location."}
{"text":"The service was good, everyone was nice, even the bathrooms were nice, however the pizze wasn't so good. It barely had any sauce, it was just bread with cheese basically. I was a little disapointed since I've heard so many good things about their pizza. They also only had like 2 tvs in the whole place, so wouldn't recommend for awkward first dates if you're trying to space out while eating or something like that..."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. The crust is very thick, so if you're a thin crust lover this wont be the place for you.  Their hot wings are divine!"}
{"text":"The pizza had HARDLY any sauce. It was so dry. Also very little cheese. It tasted like a day old pizza. I've been to other Barros and they are way better. I would not recommend this Barrows."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for about a year now. The food is always consistent and delicious, the staff is always freindly and helpful. We had a small problem one visit, and the manager went above and beyond to resolve. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best hot wings hands down!! Solid 10 everytime we order pizza & wings. LOVE BARROS!!!"}
{"text":"My family of 7 loves all their food... pizza, wings, pasta and garlic bread. You can't go wrong here. Fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"We stopped in because we had a \"welcome to the neighborhood\" coupon for a free large one topping.  We presented the coupon before ordering.  The cashier, Michelle, was blase bordering on rude when she asked what topping we wanted.  Then she didn't bother to ask if we wanted anything else, just rang up the free pizza and told us to sit and wait for 15-20 minutes.     I haven't tasted the pizza yet but it can't possibly be so good that it merits the employees being allowed to treat the customers poorly.  Sorry if your life sucks Michelle, but nobody else needs to be burdened with your poopy attitude."}
{"text":"I come to this Barros about twice a month. For the price the pizza is great! My kids love it too because there is a kid area with games and a tv showing kid shows. Is it the best pie in town? No. But it's great for the price and family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to give it a try, she was in the mood for pizza. We ordered the Barros Special I believe. Thin crust.  Good but not great pizza. Salad bar was fair, the large bowl was LARGE.  They were very busy when we walked in, but it took me more time to decide what I wanted than it did to get served. Overall a decent place, better than a chain, but not killer."}
{"text":"So glad they opened a location over here! Good service, great pizza, and an ice cold bud! Keeps me coming back for sure:)"}
{"text":"Pizzas always delicious and piping hot. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. My favorite is the Barros special pizza. Spicy chicken wings are good too. Conveniently located at Tatum and Dynamite. Looks like they will be moving soon though. The flyer says mid-October but as of 10/22/16, still at Tatum & Dynamite location."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery and was impressed.  We had a bit of everything... Pizza, wings, salad, and a sub.  It was all delish.   It took an hour for delivery.  My only concern, the celery that came with the wings was loosely thrown into a paper bag with the ranch dressing and forks, etc.  Usually it's put in a small baggie or such.  Kinda yucky so it went into the trash.  Will definitely order from them again, beats the other chains by a long shot!"}
{"text":"This is a great location. Glad it's the closest to us. Barros is the best pizza and wings for the most reasonable price in the Valley. The low key, family atmosphere at this location is great for the kids."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location dozens of times, and have never had any issues.  The food is always hot, and the staff is always friendly.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"When we ordered Barro's for delivery, we didn't realize that they were a chain.  Despite being a chain, we were impressed and we enjoyed our meal.  Their pies are very similar to ones served at Papa John's, but not near as greasy (a good thing for us).  We ordered their Barro Special, which is pretty much a deluxe that you'd see at other places.  The crust had a nice rise to it.  The toppings tasted fresh.  The cheese was decent, but a little rubbery.  The sauce came in a perfect portion.  Overall, when compared to other chain delivery (they don't have free delivery btw) stores, we give Barro's Pizza a 3.5 to 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. There was a mix up with my phone order. I asked for an extra large but the order was for a large.. The manager was super nice about it. Offered to throw in a small to make it up and wouldn't let me pay for the difference. Super pleased with the customer service."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to get some pizza from the competitors by this Hawaiian BBQ place nearby but Mr. W. wanted to try Barro's.  Driving by numerous times, I had always assumed Barro's was the same as the mall food-court place \"Sbarro.\"  If only!  We had ordered their special of an XL one-topping pizza with 24 wings for $28.  We ended up with a pepperoni pizza, 12 fire wings, and 12 BBQ wings.  I don't know if I was experiencing a lost of taste but everything tasted bland to me.  It had a good amount of cheese and pepperoni but there seemed to be a lack of seasoning.  The crust was almost a punishment in itself.  Although it was a chewy crust, it ended up being something to mindlessly gnaw on while staring at the television.  I do enjoy the portion size for the price and they weren't stingy with the ranch [although I wanted blue cheese sauce].  Mr. W. said the fire wings were outrageous but he also said the pizza was pretty good so I'm not sure what to say to that.  The BBQ wings did taste better cold out of the fridge the next day though.   All in all, I'm not sure we'll be back again as there are many more options around that delivers more bang [and flavor] for the buck."}
{"text":"Wow the rudest most  despicable \"manager\" I ever dealt with at the Scottsdale Grayhawk location. His name was Casey... Or so he said. Blonde guy with tats on his arms. I have been going to Barros for ten years. I go here almost every day for lunch. It's located by my work and home. I know the staff and the previous managers. They've all been great and welcoming. This was my first ever bad experience and holy cow this guy needs to be fired!!!! I went in for lunch. And I simply asked when the new fresh pizza comes out? Simple question. It was noon and I knew they'd be making more slices. The kid behind the counter was acting nervous and said that there's still some good slices out. That's fine but I just asked so I know whether I should order a medium pizza or just get a slice of its fresh. He goes back and talks to Casey. The kid comes out and tells me it's a 7 minute wait. Fine. I pay and he  continues to act nervous. He forgets my drink. I sit down and 3 minutes later I see that kid take a slice from the old slices sitting out. He brings it in a to go box. I never said to go. I'm furious because he LIED to me. The point isn't that it was a old slice but now he's trying to lie to me?? I ask to speak to the manager and Casey comes out. He says \"we're not in the business of making fresh pizza just for you\". I didn't say just for me. It's noon. You're going to be making some anyway. What's the big deal if I wanted to wait??! Then he arrogantly says that I HAVE to eat what's left over and that he knows the managers and he's not concerned about getting in trouble. Then he lectures me about starving kids in Africa. What the fuck??? I'm a customer, a female and you so disrespectfully rude????? I am never going back to barros again if this asshole isn't fired!!!!!! Spinatos or rosatis here I come."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends and they ordered pizza and wings. The pepperoni & chicken pizza is DELICIOUS. The honey hot wings were good too. One slice of pizza was filling. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The service was not...I go here all the time and it has recently gone downhill fast (service wise)"}
{"text":"Messed up my order and delivered it 2 hours late. This was from the Powers location in Mesa. Is it really that hard to make and deliver a pizza. Obviously this place is in need of new management. I think his name was Rocky. Never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Our office staff goes to this Barro's location once a week for their lunch specials. We are very happy with the food, not so much with the service.  There are usually two girls who are working every time we go in. One girl is very rude and has a really bad attitude. She makes us feel like we are inconveniencing her greatly by just being there. There have been a couple times they've screwed up our order, and when we bring it to her attention, she's really put out. The other girl is very nice but kind of an airhead. She often forgets our order and we have to go to the counter to remind her that we're waiting for something.  I called the manager a few weeks ago and complained about these girls. He was very apologetic and said he would deal with it. I have to say I've definitely noticed a change in both of them the last couple weeks. They are working to improve their attitudes and service.  Now to the food. The lunch specials are very good deals. I usually get once slice of pizza, a salad and a drink for $4.25. I have always been really happy with everything. The pizza is really good and cheesy. The salad is fresh and includes cheese and yummy croutons. I especially love their blue cheese dressing.  Overall, I'm happy with this Barro's, especially if their staff continues to improve with their service and attitudes."}
{"text":"This is good pizza for the price. It's hard to find real pizza in Laveen without driving a ways. Even my Dad likes Barro's and he is from Chicago and grew up eating Italian style pizza. He does complain that it's only mozzarella. Occasionally I have to wait longer than I should for my pick up order, but they usually make up for it with a coupon."}
{"text":"New to Verrado and wanted to try a local pizza delivery place and i wasnt disappointed! Pizza was fresh and tasted great. In addition the boneless wings were really good and the delivery driver wsa nice. The only reason i didnt give them 5 stars is because it took 75 minutes for the pizza to arrive. I will definetly be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"1st of all let me say this is our 1st visit to Barros location. We came today because we saw that Barros is giving all their proceeds to Saint Mary's food bank. What a great idea, so charitable of them. As for the reviews posted by Simon W., I don't know where he was but we went to the bathroom and they were really clean and well stocked.  The staff was very courteous. The food was tremendous, will certainly return to this location. And to Chloe S., would like to thank her for giving the tip about ordering the garlic butter. It was great for dipping our crust in, we even took some home, we will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I love Barros I grew up eating it and use to walk to it when it was on 43rd Ave and Bell years ago.  This pizza is one of the best in the valley and you can't go wrong with their lunch specials which is perfect. Which is crazy nowadays when you go to lunch anywhere they want you to drop 20 bucks for a meal and the quality isn't there.  Barros has quality with a great price."}
{"text":"Excellent Delivery Service. They made every effort to deliver the pizza warm and clean every time. Very friendly staff. Do ask for cheese, pepper, napkins, cups, plastic utensils though.  Am visiting from California and Barro's made a very positive impression of Arizona. Barro's would be the first to call when I return and will the word.  Thank You again."}
{"text":"Great service Excellent pizza and wings salad was fresh and very nice portion, great lunch at a great price:)"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Ran by teens who don't have manners and can't even say a simple you're welcome. Will not come back, we went at like 4pm a lot dirty tables and seemed bothered when asked if my table could be wiped down. So sad because pizza is good and this place is close to our home but I rather drive somewhere else. Customer service is a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Barros pizza is top notch. Love the hot wings and the service is great. Been to several barros locations and got to say this one is up there."}
{"text":"Friendly vibe from the server when I picked up a hawaiian pizza with bacon and pineapple. It was pretty tasty, although probably a little greasy. Looked like a nice place to dine-in sometime."}
{"text":"Barros has good ranch. Friendly staff. They should make a barros chorizo or banana smoothies. If they did I don't think the ranch would be good with banana smoothies. Great establishment."}
{"text":"I order pizza from this place at least once a week, around this area there is nothing better than this place. I order to go or delivery. not too thrilled with the restaurant itself, due to the fact this place is always busy it can be a bit messy at times."}
{"text":"The ravioli was okay.  The sausage pizza was good, except one piece had literally 2 pieces of sausage on it and that's it.  Ripped off.   Girls at counter are always nice.  One of the manger guys that sometimes works the counter is always grumpy.  He should not work the registers.  And I don't see how he is a manager or lead when he's grumpy every single time we go there.  Grumpasauraus."}
{"text":"Always good slices of pizza and my kids like this place too and appreciate the good slices that they offer. Always good slice specials."}
{"text":"So we have had Barros for the last 10+ years from this spot.  Always delivery.  We love Barros.  We actually went and sat down to eat tonight and it was amazing...pizza, wings great keep it up we will be back!"}
{"text":"Can't see how this is Chicago style.  It's just what others call \"double dough\" and rather puffy, but certainly not stuffed deep dish pizza.  It's more like a Papa John's crust but a little thicker.  Staff at counter didn't seem too bright, and seemed annoyed that I wanted the change from my $20."}
{"text":"Cleanliness of this Barro's puts some others to shame (like the one on Tatum & Dynamite).  Nice staff.  Pizza is the same as other locations which is rather good (the thicker crust at least, in my opinion).  Ample parking.  Great lunch deal of two thick crust slices & drink for $4."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff friendliness are really outstanding, in last couple visits at least.  Pizza is excellent, and incomparable value here on the slice lunch combos.  Wish they could have more slices available, as sometimes they're completely out of one or two choices."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean atmosphere, and tasty pizza that reminds me of the older locations in Tempe.  Original crust was just perfect, cheese was silky smooth, and there was a great vibe in the place.  Nice lunch stop with slices too."}
{"text":"I've had the wings before here and thought they were good so I got carry out and ordered them again. Nobody likes dry wings... Right? Therefore wings that have a lot of sauce of them should be good... Right? What I got was 12 wings sitting in 2 inches of sauce... I literally had to fish out every wing from being totally submerged. On top of that they took my celery (2 pieces) and threw it in a brown paper bag with a packet of ranch. Just what everyone wants from their vegetables... Floating around in a brown paper bag with a plastic Ranch container that has touched God knows what. I think that they mean well but in the end it just makes the wings almost offensive to eat. I suggest you ask for light sauce and if you want more just get some on the side."}
{"text":"awesoem place great pizza and wings love going there and chilling and eating my wings great place"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley. They have quality ingredients and great service.  This is definitely a go to spot."}
{"text":"We mostly eat here out of convenience cause its right by home. but sincerely there's nothing special happening with this pizza. average tasting. prices are obviously cheap. And the actual restaurant smells bad when i enter - we just phone order and pick up. salad bar spread always appears unappetizing, old lettuce and such. I guess it's true what they say; \"you get what you pay for\"???"}
{"text":"I love Barro's Pizza. Their wings are great but this location has let me down time and time again. This time however, it went too far. I got food poisoning that lasted 3 days. The first night we ordered wings, and two pizzas for the family and enough for leftovers.  The first night I didn't eat the one that had meatball on it. The second day however, I did and for 3 days I had terrible stomach pains and endless trips to the bathroom.   This location is the worst, the employees don't care enough for their customers and the inside of the place is too small for the employees to take on the load they do."}
{"text":"I support local businesses but what happened here?? This place was the BEST pizza I had ever had when I moved here and now it is at the bottom of my list.  Awhile back the pizza gave me food poisoning and the manager gave me a coupon for more pizza. I was hesitant but went to the store and got another pizza. It was just very bland.  Since then I hadn't had the pizza until around January of 2017. We ordered boneless wings and 2 pizzas with breadsticks. We was delivered was something else. We got the wings but bone in. One of the toppings was wrong. We called in to tell them that our order was wrong. They wanted proof. PROOF??  Do we need to record our pizza orders now?? The manager (I assume) was kind of a jerk about it. We had to convince him that he was wrong about the order and we already paid. They sent another delivery guy out who seemed really confused as to why he was delivering food to us for free. Then we finally got to sit down and eat...nearly two hours later after we placed our first order.  Flavor: Meh. Used to be great but now very flavorless. Cheese Pull: Used the be the best. This is what got me so long ago but nowadays it's less than average. Crust: Dry, for some reason it is very dry. Price: Fair. Cold Test: Taste better cold. Next day test: Eat it cold or throw it into a toaster. It taste better the second time.  Overall: Guys, you need to step it up a bit. You used to be the best and now you're at the bottom."}
{"text":"I love the pizza, wings and salad bar.  We always get their original crust pizza which is delicious but lately they have been putting a little more sauce than I prefer so we started ordering thin crust which is so yummy!   The wings are so yummy and they offer both regular wings and boneless."}
{"text":"They need to either add more phone lines or online ordering. I've called several times on several different days to always get a busy signal."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted! Here for lunch with friends.A person, I think female enters with a large male child and even larger beast of a dog. Appeared to be some kind of pit bull. After walking the dog around the room, sat at corner booth by front door. The beast stank. We could smell it 20 feet away. These people appeared to be friends with a female employee who joined them several times, was laughing and talking with them. The dog was wearing some type of service dog apparel, but there did not appear to be anything obviously wrong with owner. Dog barked and growled at times. Will never return to this place, since management allows people to behave like this. Later had digestive issues from pizza."}
{"text":"06-22-2012 X-Lg Barros Special pizza was not cooked enough. Dough was soft and chewy could have cooked much more. Flavors didn't have enough time to blend.  Resolve: Cook it longer please. Get that bottom crust very toasted. It would be way better and closer to what an actual pizza should be.  11-19-2011 The cashier asked me if I wanted my receipt for my credit card purchase. Duh! Yeah! Went there last night and ordered a take-out X-Large MegaMeat. Got home and it was on thick crust which I didn't order or like. The pizza was super dry with minimal sauce and cheese. It was awful. Oh how I wish RoundTable Pizza was in Mesa."}
{"text":"Just hung up with them, tried to order med. pizza for delivery. They informed me that  i was .25cents short for minimum delivery. They told me i needed to order something else to get over the minimum......no thanks. I was not hungry but my daughter wanted pizza. The question here is if i offered you $13.00 or $ 200.00 which one would you take........you guessed it folks they chose $13.00! Being a long time customer your beginning to get my drift here. I guess that is their business model, get every last penny up front or in this case .25 cents as you can. So goodbye Barrows....pizza sauce of late was starting to taste like ketchup anyway. Keep tripping over a dollar to grab a quarter.....seems to be working or you"}
{"text":"This pizza was VERY tasty! Loved the sauce.  Loved the classic crust. The cheese was yummy.  Only complaint and almost a deal breaker, was is was VERRRY greasy.  You know when you eat something greasy and you can feel that weird texture on the roof of your mouth?  Well it was like that only all over my mouth, even my lips.  But I have to say, I ate the left overs the next day.  As good as it was, I probably would not order from them again.  Sorry. Oh also, we got the cheesy bread.  Again very tasty.  It had a great garliciness to it, not too over powering but definately there...yet again....greasy.  :-("}
{"text":"The pizza was great!. Good amount of sauce and flavor. We also had the boneless wings which were also fantastic. It has a classy, friendly feel and it was clean.   The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the food came out a little slow but it was also a Friday night. Overall we will be back again."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre and I was surprised. The Barros in Litchfield Park and the one in Tempe have always been outstanding.   Maybe I just got them on a bad day... but it didn't live up to the expectations set by the other locations."}
{"text":"Me and husband went in tonight (our first time)  and the young lady at the counter was soooo friendly. He attitude was amazing. We ordered pizza and wings which both were really good. Came out fast. I needed a few extra things such as ranch and hot peppers she was really friendly ( I've been to other places where they get annoyed if you ask for other things) she had no problem getting them for me. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food came late, which would have been fine, had it been fresh. The pizza was soggy and not even close to being warm, and the wings had obviously been sitting for a good while, because they had no crispiness to them whatsoever. The only savior was the side salad.  This was just super disappointing, because I just moved to the area and love to order in. Defined won't do delivery again from this place."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time from here. We ordered the pepperoni large and a Barro's combo and wings medium. Loved the pepperoni, loved the wings but the combo pizza was raw :( I think they need to cook the combo pizzas a little longer? Shame because the pepperoni was pretty great."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I got a call from the manager who was very nice and talked to me about what happened so they could address it. They also gave us a sandwich on them. Big thanks for caring and we will most definitely be back!!!  Love the food but since they moved the customer service is terrible! I went in last night and ordered a cold sandwich for my son to go and they said it would be 10 minutes. We waited 30 then went up and asked if it was almost ready. The girl who seemed very overwhelmed (and they weren't that busy) went back and asked a guy if he had made the sandwich to which he replied \"I don't know\". We waited again for them to make it since they obviously forgot and just got a half hearted \"sorry bout that.\" I'm hesitant to go back after last night seeing as they could have cared less that they just forgot as we sat right in front of them for over half an hour. Step up the customer service and this place would be great!!"}
{"text":"So over this place. Time and time again I tell myself to give this place another chance. Because I did like there pizza but after countless mess ups I'm done spending my money on a pizza place that charges more  then several other pizza joints close by for a crappy pizza. And they do nothing to make it right. Got my 'pizza' or what was left of it: open the box and all of my toppings were off of the pizza and all to the side of the box. $20 for what looks like a sloppy cheese pizza and horrible customer service"}
{"text":"The Staff and Management are very disorganized, Rude and unwilling to work with you, they messed up my order and said they would put a 5 credit for my next visit. so the next time I was going to order they made it seem like I was dumb for asking about my $5 credit. basically tell me to bad. It my fault in making sure they did not do what what they said they were going to do. So will not return to place, terrible management"}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to post my review on this place! Favorite pizza in the valley and I have been to som of the so called best. Their gluten free is by far the best. Workers are nice and do their best to get through the tale out rush."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The restaurant itself is a little plain and the arcade games are old with some not working. Aside from that I just love the pizza"}
{"text":"Mmmm! You have got to love being able to drop in and for under $5 get a huge slice of pizza, a soda and a salad.  For some reason the pizza always tastes better from the warmer! The chicken hawaiin pizza? HELLO HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"Overall it was pretty good pizza. The downside is that they messed up our order and didn't say a word, just made us sit and wait an extra 25 minutes. No apologies either. The girl at the register knew we were displeased with the unexplained waiting and she was kinda rude giving us our food, like she just wanted us to leave. I'm not sure if it was just that girl but it was upsetting to have that happen."}
{"text":"After picking up the granddaughter from daycare we decided to go get a pizza to go.  We thought they had a salad bar but they didn't so we got salads to eat while we waited for the pizza.  The granddaughter enjoyed eating her diced carrots and watching the kids who were playing with the toys, games and other amusements.  We got our salads and the three if of split those small salads which were quite ample.  Just as we finished up the pizza came and we were ready to go!  The granddaughter waved farewell to the crowd there.  Thepizza stayed nice and warm for the short trip home.  We then split up the pizza and had a fine dinner while the rain fell outside.  Perfect.  The granddaughter loved the pizza and ate a lot!  I love the mushrooms on the pizza!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"best veggie pizza.  i haven't eaten veggie pizza in years but was happy to find this local place near our house.  the staff is nice, service is quick and the food never fails to satisfy late cravings."}
{"text":"One the best pizzas I've had, I got from this place. It's my hubby who really loves pizza. When he orders, I would it a slice or two and that's it. But when I really like it very much, I would grab for one or two more slice! Haha  This pizza place got me! Their pizza is wayyy better and yummier for some reason! I remember when I and my friends ordered, I ate like 4 slices without even noticing it. That's how good it was! I like their buffalo chicken too, very tasty and their sauce is very good!  Their store is clean, and they  have good customer service! No wonder why a lot of people love this place"}
{"text":"So as you are all aware, football season has commenced.  Now that my roomie and I have NFL Sunday TIcket we are going to be spending football Sundays at home much more often than at the sports bars.  This means having a place that delivers good pizza and wings is a must!  We were pleasantly surprised to discover this location delivers to our residence.  I think they have a larger grid than most delivery places which is awesome.  I really can't think of a place that meets all the criteria my roomie and I have to really like a pizza delivery place.  Price, quality, taste, and service are all above average here.    We ordered one of their specials which was an X-Large one topping pizza with 24 wings for 23.99 and a 2 liter of coke.  With taxes, delivery charge, and tip the total came to $34.00.  We ate the pizza and wings for lunch and dinner yesterday, some friends munched on the food too and we STILL have leftovers.  At least half a pizza and a dozen wings.  I would call that getting your money's worth.   The pizza doesn't taste generic like the big chains I dare not order from.  I really like the dough, crust, sauce, and cheese.  I also like that they don't COVER the pizza in pepperoni (not a fan but I was outvoted).  Is there better pizza out there? Yes.  But this does exactly the trick on a football sunday.  The wings are delicous.  We had the medium sauce (which they do not skimp on) and it had the perfect amount of heat to it.  There were A LOT of drums which I found surprising.  And these wings came from some fatty fatterson chickens, they are very big and meaty!  Score, score, and score!  One slice of pizza and two wings did me in (I'm sure the beer helped!)  Also they gave a delivery time estimate of 45min-1hr and they delivered in less than 40.  Yes, I was keeping track.  Major points scored here.   Barros will be getting regular delivery calls from us for the rest of football season!"}
{"text":"I placed a call in order.   I arrived to a huge line and asked where I pick up my order.  The manager said \"get in line\".  So I asked him why I placed a call in order if I still have to wait.   I called and was quoted 30min, arrived 50min later and was told at least 10 more min."}
{"text":"We love the pizza at Barros. The restaurant is always clean which is a pretty big deal as well!! They are usually really quick with the order, although on a friday night when it is busy you might have to wait a little bit, but not too bad. I think the price is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"the people who get fooled on the commercials for frozen pizza into thinking its delivery obviously only eat pizza from here. it's like frozen pizza, but costs more. awful"}
{"text":"Last week I had a pizza delivered to my son at his school.  This was cleared with his schools office personnel prior to ordering.   The order taker was extremely pleasant and was eager to assist.  He assured me he would call if any problems arose with the delivery.  The order was delivered no problems and I left a generous tip to accommodate.   Today I called at 11:45 to have another order placed and delivered.  This was a different employee.  He told me they stopped taking orders to be delivered at schools.  I informed him of last weeks order.  He said this was a recent policy.  No problem.  Except he was extremely rude in his response and delivery of his message.  Where's the guy from last week?!  He was so much more pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"We love coming here to get our pizza and salad fix!  This is the best pizza place we've found that's close to our home. This place also serves beer and wine"}
{"text":"Being a pizza lover and living in Vistancia in NW Peoria means I live in frustration. If I don't want to drive 30 minutes for better pizza in another part of town, the pickings out here for delivery or a quick dine out for pizza are really slim. However Barrows at this location provides the best pizza we've  found in the culinary wasteland where we live. It's pretty good actually. Deliveries are quick and it arrives hot and if you eat there the dining room is fine, a typical pizza joint dining room but and a quick in and out."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant because it has friendly service and good food.  The original pizza is doughy and thick and the crust is chewy. The side salad is fresh and I love the thick mozzarella cheese that they use.  Drinks are free refills.  Our son loves their pasta with butter, which comes with a slice of garlic bread and a kids drink for $4.99.  Order at the counter and they give you a number.  Sit and wait for it to come to you. I am definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza and wings ever. I used to go to Native New Yorker for cheap wings, but these are soo much better. I love how saucy they are and not too fatty. The pizza does not skimp on cheese like most places. I've only gotten carry out so I'm not sure how great the delivery service is. I believe this is a not a chain and you can tell by the quality of the food. The place is usually busy so dont expect individual service but it is all worth it."}
{"text":"Officially my new favorite pizza place and go to for all things delicious.  Gotta love that thick Chicago style pizza.  Wings were mediocre, but the pizza makes up for it.  Meatball grinder also very good.  Restaurant never seems full but there's always a massive line for takeout.  I'm always one of them and will continue to be! Update:  New location is even better.  Cleaner than before and more open.  They needed a bigger place and now I see more people eating in."}
{"text":"Far better pizza than any other around.  For the same price as the Paps John's and Domino's too."}
{"text":"Horrendous customer service. Will not order from this location again, which means I won't order from barros again. We used to use the 7th street location and they were great, good prompt friendly service, great food, and great delivery times. We moved, and this is now the closest location. Called to place a order and the guy hangs up on me. Called back, figuring it was probably accidental, and gave them our phone number...which doesn't pull up. Now usually, this is where the employee would get the rest of our info to place in the system if it isn't there already, but instead this idiot decides to berate me for not being in the system, as if not being in the system means I cannot order from them. After finally asking him that very question, he decided to finally ask me for my name and information to put in the system, however by this point I was fed up with this idiot and decided to order from some other place, probably Stevie's pizza on 59th. Goodbye barros, your pizza was good, but not good enough to take abuse from your moronic employees."}
{"text":"They are just so inconsistent, it's not worth it. I just ordered a 1/2-veggie, 1/4-pepperoni, 1/4-cheese, and they not only got all that wrong, they baked a crappy pizza - not even hot right from the kitchen. And my wife ordered take-out from right there in the store. If you're after Chicago style pizza, try Salerno's or Rosati's (Ray and McQueen is the real one). Give this place a pass."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had. I ordered delivery for my friends and I the pizza shows up over 30 minutes after an initial wait time of 1 hour... So it took 1.5 hours. The pizza was soggy and greasy, the wings were hard and fatty.  Honestly it sucked and I feel like I got ripped off - not to mention all the apologies and feeling like a horrible host to my friends. I called back and explained, but they seemed like high school phone girls who don't understand I can care less about getting a discount on my next purchase because I'm not going to order this EVER again. Personally I thought it would be a step up from dominos but I was proved wrong.. Now I know 2 pizza places that deliver to my house and suck.  I've had celery before, but celery in a plain brown bag ( with no container just a dirty ragged brown bag) is a first for me. As much as this placed made me nauseated and they can't take the horrid taste out of my mouth they did reach a new low for me in terms of pizza/service."}
{"text":"Love this Pizza!      BEST in Town!! It's good from beginning to end!  The staff is awesome, the Pizza is the best and it is always consistant!  Yummy, yummy!! Try it...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Service was bad- they took forever to bring out our food, it wasn't like they were busy neither. Pizza was alright."}
{"text":"Couple things to note: So far, we have only had delivery and the pizza we choose was the meatball pizza due to having a coupon along with mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were very good and we enjoyed the sauce, the pizza was cheesy, but it ended up working in their favor as we enjoyed that surprise.  Usually we go for the specials which you can find on their website and if we end up swinging by I will check in, but I felt the need to give them a mention as the food was great, delivered on time and by a friendly delivery guy."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicago style pizza! Nice customer service and comfortable and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for the money. Barro's has the thick crusted Chicago style, rather than the thin crusted type. I prefer the thin crust, but for thick crust it wasn't bad. My parents and I all had the lunch special, and it was a lot of food for a pretty good price. We all had either 1 or 2 slices (the slices are very large), a small salad, and a drink and the total was I believe $18.75, not bad at all. I liked the salad although my parents weren't all that thrilled with it, and the pizza was solid, if nothing spectacular. Service was pretty decent, and the place was clean and visually appealing. There were several televisions tuned to various sports channels in case you don't like the company you're with ; )  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but it certainly did the job."}
{"text":"Barros' pizza is fucking bomb.  but i was very annoyed by paying for ranch dipping sauce, and the \"buffalo\" dipping sauce...i'm sorry people..but hot wing sauce isn't thick like dressing. it's ok tho. but for like 50 cents....please."}
