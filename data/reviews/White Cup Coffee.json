{"text":"I happened upon this place while I was working down the road. The first time I went in the service was great and food was great. I was happily surprised to see a bookshelf with plenty of books to read. Every subsequent trip was just as nice. Staff is friendly always a smile on very attentive the cook even comes out directly to bring you your food and always with a smile. I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on that but it sure does smell nice. Will return and refer people to go there."}
{"text":"friendly, attentive staff, good coffee, delicious cinnamon rolls, and lots of regulars that say this place is worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the ambiance and the Vienna Latte was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Super nice service from owner. He made sure we felt welcome and served delicious fruit."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in the area for a while and had this on our to-do list.  It lacked the Arcadia charm and the staff wasn't particularly keen.  My eggwhite omelet was two bites and served with 4 large pieces of toast.  I can tell they are trying, but it is awkward.  Kleenex boxes on the table?     Will try them again next year to see if they improve!"}
{"text":"This is the first review I've ever written on a yelp business! I just came here for the first time. Seems to be a really quaint, clean and peaceful environment. Coffee is great because there's three different options for drip, Mexican, Brazilian and regular. I was just going to get my coffee Togo then (who I imagine the owner) offered me a free plate of fruit. Which I accepted and enjoyed. It's apparent they have a lot of regulars who adore them, I can see why. I'll be back ! Really wonderful humans occupy this space"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall; best fruit and yogurt bowl for me and awesome fresh baked cinnamon roll for the hubby!  Friendly service and atmosphere-we'll be back."}
{"text":"I was and still am, impressed by how nice the people who work here are. The woman at the counter was very sweet and made sure I liked my coffee and the gentleman in the back makes the best yogurt parfait. The fruit looks fresh picked and tastes just as good. I have come back two days in a row because of how good the product and people are. I hope that anyone reading this will drop in and experience it for themselves."}
{"text":"My wife and I went into the White Cup Coffee shop this morning.  She had a dentist appointment  just around the corner.  So after that  we were looking for a place to have  breakfast.  Being from the Prescott  area we were not familiar with the area. So we turned to YELP.  The reviews were good so we thought why not try it ourselves. .  It was SUPER.  GREAT  atmosphere.  Small place but everything was great.  I had the VEGGIE  OMELET , HASH BROWNS , SOURDOUGH TOAST.  Excellent meal.  My wife hade EGG AND CHEESE  SCRAMBLE  with a side of BACON.  With SOURDOUGH  TOAST.  She had coffee and I had iced tea. The portions where just right.  Price was even better.  The lady that runs the place was just the nicest person.  Oh yeah the RASPBERRY JELLY  was great also.  AND yes we will definitely go back next time we have to visit the dentist  or happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot to get a coffee fix and some work done while I waited for my next meeting and found this little gem on Yelp!  Great coffee, friendly folks and free wifi.  Fits the bill perfectly!  Looks like they have a breakfast and lunch menu so I'll be coming back to sample that soon!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's very charming. The owner was our cashier and was so sweet. The pastries are also baked there and it just has a very homey feel. I ordered a plain coffee with a cinnamon roll. The brewed coffee was self serve and brewed with vanilla and cinnamon (yum!) The cinnamon roll was giant and fluffy. Cream cheese frosting was perfect. And even better is that they are dog-friendly!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, and they made me a great custom vegan sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have the privilege of living right across the street from the \"White Cup Coffee\". I felt at home as soon as I walked in there. I am in there every other day or so. Breakfast is good. Ice coffee is excellent   And it is mellow so I am able to get some writing done"}
{"text":"Disappointed - ordered an Americano with soy and hazelnut, and it tasted like hot water. My son ordered an iced coffee, seen that the coffee was premade and stored in a pitcher. The barista attempted to pour the coffee when he noticed the top of the pitcher had frozen over, so he chipped away at it to pour the coffee out, I have NEVER seen this at a coffee shop. The soy milk was kept in a 1/2 gallon carton, and the guy STEAMED the soy milk INSIDE the carton for my drink, and then again for my sons drink, doesn't this add WATER to the soy...ugh. I didn't even finish my watered down Americano...never going there again."}
{"text":"cute indy place. Mexican coffee was great"}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are awesome and seem like genuinely good people. Not to mention that their granola and yogurt is to die for!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! Family owned ... the young lady that helped me when I told her I was meeting a friend here she brought out a fruit platter on the house to welcome my friend and I. Talk about service! I had the vienne latte ..she called it l, it was sweet but not too sweet... touch of cinnamon."}
{"text":"This place was great! We popped in around 11:30a on Wednesday and got excellent service. It was clean, cute and they had free WiFi. The lady working was sweet and patient with our questions, but she was the only one there so I felt bad for her. If they had been busy, she definitely would've been overwhelmed.   I ordered a matcha smoothie with soy, and my fianc√© ordered a caramel Frappuccino. Both of our drinks were very good. We also ordered lunch, the curry chicken salad and ultimate BLT sandwiches - which took a bit of time but was freshly prepared and had a great presentation. She even offered a fruit salad over chips, which I was thankful for. Overall a great experience, a decent lunch, and will definitely go back to try some of their freshly baked treats!   Thanks, White Cup Coffee!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything is so fresh and they have full breakfast for a coffee place (not just bagels and muffins). Excellent lunches too. I will walk in from time to time and they will have a homemade pie on the counter. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gracious hospitality! Yummy coffee! I have enjoyed watching this coffee shop blossom into what it is today. The only thing I would change is the interior design vibe. It's fun the way it is i just think it needs to feel more relaxed. I will continue to support this business. Stop in and meet the wonderful family who owns and runs White Cup Coffee."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while so ended up scheduling a business meeting there during the week.  I was warmly greeted by the owner who got me started with a delicious cup of cinnamon-spiked coffee followed by a yummy bowl of oatmeal.  My client had a skinny latte and a cinnamon roll, which she thoroughly enjoyed as well.  I like to support independent coffee shops (as opposed to SBUX) and I noticed a lot of folks who seemed to be regulars, which is always a good sign.This is a great little joint with good coffee, good food, and good service.  I'll be back soon and recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"Found this place near my house. The service is great and seems likes it's ran by a family. The coffee is amazing and I enjoy getting the quick and easy breakfast! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the food and the cheesesteak special was pretty good, but it won't be cracking my top 10 list. It is the Wednesday special and served with a drink and potato chips for $5.95. This version was served on Sourdough with peppers and the cheese was mixed into the meat as a proper cheesesteak should be made. Solid sandwich and a good local coffee place still. She now stays open until 4pm on some days - check the Facebook page."}
{"text":"I was in the area craving some coffee after looking up some places on yelp, this place had great reviews. Now I know why, great customer and coffee is on point!! Def a must if your in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the iced dirty chai! Yum! Also the Denver scramble is quite delicious! It's a quaint and friendly local coffee spot and I might be addicted! Please check them out! Also, I hear their cinnamon rolls are to DIE for! I haven't tried it yet because I love my scramble!"}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and have a white cup dirty chai (pumpkin if available) iced is so good! Such a cute small business and the owner is such a nice person. I love supporting this business and I suggest you do as well!"}
{"text":"My beverage was delicious! I love supporting locally. The owner and I believe his daughter were so kind and hospitable. I'd support this local coffee brew anytime before I walk into a cheap corporate Starbucks chain."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a nonfat vanilla latte on my way to a meeting on Friday morning and it was good, not great. There was a little wait and overall, it didn't knock my socks off. However, it is near my house and I would rather support a local business than Starbucks so it is likely that I will be back! :) It did have a cozy atmosphere so it may be nice to come here and work someday! I would like to try their food next time."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now after forgetting my lunch at work. Their veggie scamble is fantastic! Wonderful experiences and great prices!"}
{"text":"This place is very inconsistent. IDK if they use ingredients from different places or if they don't follow a recipe or what the deal is.  But today was my 3rd time in and my food AGAIN tasted different!  That's the kind of thing that drives me NUTS!"}
{"text":"Breakfast sucks--new owners have no clue about scrambled eggs with cheddar... These eggs looked like a pancake. brown on bottom. weird bubbly texture on top.  overcooked.  rubbery.  then they brought out a side plate with grated cheddar. i left.  they can keep the money.   ps. As soon as we placed our order, this breakfast plus a cup of coffee for my friend, the first thing the waitress did was collect the money... She didn't put in the order until it was paid. Even though we were seated, and dining in.  Weird! Apparently the money is priority number one, and then, she got his coffee (poor, compared to previous owner's coffee) and turned in the order.   A waste of $10...  So when we walked out without eating, disgusted, even after I told them why,  they didn't offer to get my money back, didn't chase me with a refund. no mention of a refund.   This is supposedly a coffee and breakfast place, and yet they don't know how to prepare scrambled eggs. they ought to learn.   they suck!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and coffee! Great service and friendly staff! My only suggestion would be different music or at least a variety."}
{"text":"Lovely place with a kind staff. A hidden gem in Phoenix. The food is really good. Such a delightful morning i had :)"}
{"text":"This place is great I Marked the Location. Hash browns are not as brown as I like but the place was Excellent"}
{"text":"Great local spot. I had the chicken bacon Swiss on sourdough. Tried to stop at half and take the second half home but could not resist and ate the whole sandwich! Cold brew was flavorful and refreshing. Try this place!!"}
{"text":"If you are a true coffee lover - White Cup is the place for you.  They have delicious well brewed coffee.  I love that their menu offers coffee that is outside of the \"American Coffee\" box.  They have 2 latte's that are well worth a go -  The Vienna & The The Spanish.  Today, I went with the Spanish Late - It has a touch of sweeten condensed milk that just brings out the flavor of the beans they use.  Their machine is calibrated correctly, so your cup of coffee is not to hot or burnt.  I didn't get a pastry, but most of them are made in house with great care and love of baking.  But the best part --- are the people.  The owners are wonderful.  I was greeted with a big smile and invited in.  As a parting gift,  I was given a fruit plate to go that was filled with a ripe juice selection of in season fruits.  Stop reading and go get your cup of coffee.  :-)"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant based on the other reviews as we're visiting the Phoenix area for the weekend and we were not disappointed. We ordered the breakfast scrambles, hash browns and toast and got the last cinnamon role of the day. Everything had a homemade flavor with good seasoning and the fried eggs were browned in real butter.   The role was huge and we could not finish it. The bacon was cooked to order and hash browns tasted as if from scratch.    If you want to enjoy a country breakfast with fresh ingredients and loving preparation at fantastic prices, make your way to White Cup Coffee."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I had been here before for coffee,  but not food.  We got here right before it closed and we didn't feel rushed at all.  My wife and I both had the gyro with a side salad. The salad was great with amazing light dressing and the gyro was the best I have ever had. The meat was cooked just right and was made on the spot. We had the apricot and Moroccan tea which is hard to find anywhere else. If you want the best homemade gyro in town this is where you should go."}
{"text":"The kids I nanny for dance nearby, so sometimes while I'm waiting to pick them up I'll stop in at white cup.   The service has always been wonderful. They even stayed open later for me a couple of times so I can finish up my homework on their wifi before I have to leave!   I get a different drink each time, but the quality of their coffee is great and they have delicious pastries. My personal favorite is their baklava! It tastes very authentic and it's perfectly sweet.   Definitely stop in to this quaint little coffee shop when you get the chance!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little gem today and will happily return as often as possible. Why? For one thing, the atmosphere is homey and inviting. The staff is so sweet and helpful and all-around delightful to be around. I had the delicious iced black tea and tried a piece of kombucha pie (healthy squash-made pumpkin pie). The food is delicious with lots of healthy options. Free wifi and comfy seating. Highly recommended for study sessions and book reading!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Me and my girlfriend came here one morning while we were on vacation. At first we were a little suspicious but the staff is so welcoming and sincere. We only ordered a bagel and a cinnamon roll. They brought us out a complimentary fruit plate, which was delish! The owner told me that I have to try his breakfast next time. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great small breakfast joint. Omelettes, fixins, desserts, coffee of course. New dining area adds much needed space to dine in. Reasonable prices and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I wasnt expecting much but it was much lower than my expectations. I ordered a Denver scramble asking if ham was an available substitute for the sausage and the cashier said yes. We sat outside and waited with our coffee which was not great, coffee shops should be known for great coffee...the cashier then came out and asked if I wanted bacon in the scramble and I said \"no, ham not bacon plz\" then they brought the food out and no ham but sausage. I asked him why they had not substituted ham and he argued that turkey and ham were the same thing, and I must be confused!!  Plus the eggs were like a rubber pancake and we realized they were burnt on the bottom..awful! Anyways, we were cashing out and he tried charging us $36 for our meals, about double what it should've been. I had to add the total up for him. We will never be back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee & breakfast place, great coffee and food, nice atmosphere ,and service with a big smile, we were drawn to this small coffee shop by all d good Yelp reviews and were pleased to have got Emily to take care of us, she is amazing and will be back next time in Phoenix ."}
{"text":"Wow! I was completely blown away by the generosity and friendliness of this breakfast joint. My family and I were greeted at the door and took a seat. Immediately the owner brought out a fruit tray and sweet sesame cookies. My dad got two eggs and bacon with homemade sourdough toast, my mom got egg whites with toast and my husband got the veggie scramble. Everything was absolutely delicious. We are on vacation here in Phoenix and plan to come back to this breakfast place every day! This is a must go for breakfast.. you will fall in love with the staff and food! The atmosphere is very pleasant and a great place to start your day off. Thank you for such a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"It's not easy to find an inviting, quaint, and comfortable coffee nook. I've been searching for quite some time now, and I wouldn't say that white cup is The place yet because I'm a coffee snob. However, it came close. I would have to frequent it a few more times before I feel like it's The place for me. Overall it's friendly, the food is decent, and the decor is simple."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for work and found this place through Yelp. I came here 3 times in the week I was in town because the lattes were just that good. Came here Wednesday and unfortunately they had problems with their oven, so didn't get to try the cinnamon roll until Friday. I tried their Vienna, Spanish and chai lattes. Food I've tried are bagels with cream cheese and cinnamon roll.  All three lattes are absolutely delicious. I prefer the Spanish latte over the Vienna but both are delicious. Bagel was mediocre, toasted with plain cream cheese. I've had better but still doesn't take away from my  opinion of them. Cinnamon roll had a lightly sweetened cream cheese frosting which was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a crazy sweet roll but it was just the right amount of sweet. And that frosting? I could eat it by the bucket.   Lastly, I love the owner. She was so warm and friendly. I'm from Texas and I could totally see the culture difference in Phoenix , as in grumpy people. But she made me feel right at home. Definitely will keep coming back when I'm here!"}
{"text":"located across the street from the Vig, this little coffee shop serves a great latte and a decent breakfast sandwich.  Very friendly staff and some comfy seating if you like to lounge with your cuppa joe"}
{"text":"Friendly, good cup of coffee, and simple homemade breakfast sandwich. Love it! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I work as a nanny across the street.  When the weather isn't too hot in the morning I like to take the baby I nanny on a walk. I discovered the white cup coffee while I was on one of those walks and I was immediately impressed! It has a very nice cozy feel. It feels like home there. I'm not a coffee drinker, but the food, OMG, the food is amazing!  The service is spectacular.  Every time I go in they remember me and greet me like I'm an old friend. They are friendly. Overall they have wonderful service, food, and environment!  They made a loyal customer out of me and I can't wait till summer is over to begin my daily walks to the white cup coffee again!"}
{"text":"Love the friendly neighborhood vibe here, and the Vienna latte is delicious! I've never had anything like it anywhere else. The dog friendly patio is great, I live in the neighborhood nearby so I walk my dog here for weekend coffee runs - the owner is so friendly and she always makes a point of coming out to say hi, pet my dog and make sure she has water. This is our favorite coffee shop in the area by far!"}
{"text":"The more I come, the more I love it here. All the breakfast scrambles are officially delicious; I can't even pick a favorite. I switch between them. The Spanish latte is another good one I tried, but I prefer the Vienna for the cinnamon.  Definitely worth a trip for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the cozy little coffee shop after driving by it for years.  So glad I did.  incredibly friendly staff/owner who is pleasant and eager to have you as a customer.  Answers any question you have thoroughly and with patience.  Got a really tasty Mexican bean coffee and veggie scramble.  Both were quite tasty."}
{"text":"I've always loved white cup. The new owners are so incredibly nice. They gave my dog a glass bowl of ice water while I had a bagel and coffee! They even brought me the food on a China plate with a side of fresh fruit in a tea cup. Excellent service and they went above and beyond. Really great neighborhood coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Sherrie, the owner, is a real sweetheart.  Good food and coffee!  Would highly recommend this be one of your daily stops!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop. I'm a picky vanilla cappuccino drinker and they make it perfect. My son loves the two egg breakfast with turkey bacon!!! We love to come here when we are in the city. The new owners are a delight!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with super affordable prices. Food was good quality and delicious. They make all the baked goods and all of them looked fresh. I got the veggie scramble and all the veggies were fresh. It needed a little salt but that wasnt a problem. My family of 3 ate for under $20. Yogurt parfait was huge and all of us ate off of it. Place was easy to find and everyone was really nice."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I came in here this morning for the first time with my mother and sister. It's a cute place and very clean inside! The coffee was great and the breakfast sandwich was excellent!!  Most of all the service was wonderful. The barista (I didn't catch her name) who has beautiful curly hair was so friendly and helpful.   Very reasonable prices. Will definitely come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to come in for your morning. We had some OJ and the breakfast sandwich -scrambled eggs with ham and cheese. Everything was quick and delicious. The staff are very nice and it was a great place to discover. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My goal at White Cup Coffee was simple, grab a coffee and go. It was an in and out mission. No messing around... but then I saw them. Like glorious twirling hypnotic pinwheels of goodness they immediately controlled my gaze.   Cinnamon Rolls.  On a scale from one to ten, my love for cinnamon rolls is somewhere around a 62. If I see them, I must have them. There's a funny thing about cinnamon rolls though, they're not all good... Weird right?   Finding the best cinnamon rolls takes time and perseverance. It's not an easy task, but someone has to do it, and I will sacrifice my waist line for you in order to find excellent rolls of cinn.    The cinnamon rolls at White Cup Coffee are made in-house. This, of course, is mandatory to be considered for the upper echelon level of cinnamon roll greatness.    I ordered mine to-go. When the moment finally came to eat it, there was some slight disappointment. The cinnamon roll had to be heated before eated...   Sometimes, but rarely, a cinnamon roll can be eaten cold. However, in my experience, it's best to have them warm and soft to the touch. It seemed that for now, I'd have to wait...  Tonight I popped that bad boy in the microwave (unfortunate it came to that). It was very good though. The icing was of the cream cheese variety (my fave). The roll itself wasn't as gooey as I like, but it's tough to judge after it's been sitting around all day.   Overall, I'd call the White Cup cinnamon roll a success. Of course... I will have to do more research. Another visit will be required to know for sure. And then maybe another visit, just to be Really sure.   Oh... I forgot to mention... they had coffee. It was good."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and coffee.  Great price as well...only surpassed by the amazing service and genuine care that the staff and owner gave to us.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tough to review because I loved it so much under its prior owner. The food is different but still good (not as good, but with more options).  The new owners are kind and generous, but a number of things are a bit awkwardly done.  Cappuccino was not nearly as good - not sure why, but it wasn't. Cinnamon roll wasn't even close, but it was nearly the best in town before.  Service was very friendly.   4 stars is probably being too kind, but I think the bar might have been set artificially high by how well the prior owner prepared the food, etc. Nevertheless, that's my review."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite spots in the area for breakfast/brunch! The owner is always kind and courteous; I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Coffee was excellent. The cinnamon roll was excellent. The staff were all super friendly and fast. This was my first time visiting, but I will become a patron!"}
{"text":"In the neighborhood this morning for a meeting and other party was late, so I Yelped coffee places. What a jewel! Owner greets you at door, upholstered chairs beckon, cinnamon bus make it smell like an idealized Grandmas kitchen. Cappuccino was very good; atmosphere even better. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's family owned and cute, but the fact is that we spent $19 there today and everything ordered was bad.  We got 3 whoopie pies and they were all very old. They were hard and inedible.  I got a smoothie and it was awful. Watery and mostly just almond milk, not the fruit and spinach advertised. My boyfriend got rolled ice cream and that was OK at best... it took a really long time to make and then was just kind of like overly sweet, fake ice cream tasting with M & Ms."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I've passed by before but never been inside. Delicious coffee, pastries and bagels. The lady who helped us was so kind. Happy I stumbled in"}
{"text":"I had posted a review when this place was still called \"The Coffee Lady\"   The coffee is stellar (try the Vienna latte), and my absolute favorite place to grab a drink despite the numerous little mom and pop coffee joints in Arcadia.  If you like Chai latte's, I encourage you to try theirs... you will never order one anywhere else.  I promise you!! The customer service here is so warm and welcoming.  The owner Sherry has great interaction with her other customers and I can tell there are already a lot of regulars here.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area so decided to stop in, glad we did! Great food and coffee and very friendly staff. We will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"White cup coffee sounds like it would be a lovely, small and quaint, Arcadia living coffee shop.....if it were ever open. I just moved to the Arcadia area and have been here for 2 months, I've researched them and checked their hours and every time I go between the \"open\" hours, they're closed. I'll keep trying and update later."}
{"text":"A chill cafe with nice decor! The Vienna latte is absolutely delicious! I got the cinnamon roll based on yelp reviews, but it didn't meet the high expectations. Warm and the frosting is great, but the roll is dry, so I took off one star. Overall a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"We have always loved this little neighborhood spot and now under the new ownership we are huge fans!  The coffee is great and the food is even better than before! The new owners were so kind to our high school marching band kids doing a car wash here today and we can't believe it!   Fresh fruit and the most beautiful treats! You must stop in and try them if you've been away for a while. They are very friendly and have the same great sandwiches and breakfasts you remember plus some new Mediterranean items!"}
{"text":"I went in at 10:30 am hoping to try out a new to me local coffee shop, I'd much rather support a small shop than a mainstream place. I waited almost 10 minutes at the counter while I could overhear 2 people arguing over dishes and other duties that weren't getting done. I had to leave as I was tired of hearing the argument and can't wait 15 minutes to get a latte, no one ever came out to help me. Wish I could have experienced the great reviews others gave."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here this morning as part of the coffee tour of Phoenix! I had been wanting to try this little place for awhile, so I was excited to go. The inside of the shop is very cute, which you may not guess when you see the exterior. After reading about the 'Vienna latte' I was curious what that was, so here is the skinny:   Vienna latte = latte, cinnamon, and vanilla syrup Spanish latte = latte, cinnamon, condensed milk   We got one of each. I thought the Spanish latte was way better than the Vienna, it was less sweet and tasted wonderful, but the Vienna was good too. I like that they have some original coffee drinks. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after a quick search for \"lunch & coffee near me\" and couldn't be happier I did!! We ordered the kid's turkey sandwich, which came with chips AND a cookie for under $5! (My 4.5 year old son thought it was delicious and the perfect amount of food!) And I ordered the BLT on sourdough with avocado - also delicious! While we waited for our food, my son and I cuddled up on the couch and read some books from the bookshelf. But even better than the comfy couch, tasty sandwiches and great coffee, the service was wonderful!! So accommodating and kind! I didn't realize it was almost closing time when we arrived, but she didn't rush us out when it was time to close. It's a 30min drive from our house, but we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved stopping here for breakfast this morning. I was staying with a friend in the area so I was looking for something local and close. Glad I chose White Cup coffee. When I was arrived at 9am on a Saturday morning I was a bit concerned thinking that the place should be more busy. However, after having been greeted by a beautiful and friendly woman at the counter, who also happened to be carrying in fresh cinnamon rolls, I felt welcomed. She continued to take my order and made me a wonderful soy latte, all while smiling the entire time. :) I ordered the veggie scramble and it was just what I wanted. Clearly freshly made and came with a side of fresh fruits. VERY fresh. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time and breakfast at White Cup Coffee and looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"The eclectic decor and dark cozy atmosphere transported me to my college days hanging out in funky Seattle coffee houses.  Enjoyed a late Sat breakfast with a friend. The homemade cinnamon roll was served warm with melted frosting on a real plate and melted in my mouth. The soy latte was delicious. The veggie scramble has a flavorful mix of fresh veggies and comes with whole wheat or sour dough toast.   Keep in mind that they close at 1pm and only serve cinnamon rolls on Wed and Sat."}
