{"text":"We had a party of 6 come here for dinner. I saw that they accept online reservations and didn't make one because every time was unbooked. We were hardly acknowledged at the front door by the young staff who all looked bored and fairly uninterested. We were seated after about a 10 minute wait into a pretty empty dining room. The restaurant is very very new--the construction around the area is still being worked on and this may be one of the only open restaurants in the place! Being new the d√©cor was fresh and clean, wall hangings lay by the side ready to be hung. Our waiter brought us drinks and appetizers...and they promptly disappeared (I mean truly, he was gone!) We finally (a good 15 minutes after our appetizers were long gone) asked another waiter if he could wait on us to take our dinner order and he did very cheerfully. The food was good, but perhaps not very remarkable. The kids meals offered a good variety with a side of carrots and ranch dip and a bag of scooby doo fruit snacks (odd.) We lost waiter #2 when we needed water refilled and my husband finally went to the empty bar, was unable to flag the bartender (really?!) and ended up filling the water itself. We were truly ready to head out and yet had another long wait for the bill to arrive. If you are considering coming here I would wait for the kinks to get worked out. I would not bother to make the trip from Madison--we have better options closer to home."}
{"text":"I work nearby and go there for lunch frequently. The lunch menu is delicious and affordable. The place looks nice and the service is quick and friendly!

Would definitely recommend giving it a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Drove to New Glarus to eat pizza here. Ordered an app and a pizza. Selections of signature pizza based on fast food favorites and menu descriptions compare toppings tp McDonalds. Most likely great for kids. The offerings did not appear to be aimed at who actually eats in Downtown NGlarus, out of towers .
Asked for NA beer, there was none.(was driving) 
The server did not explain anything to us, no menu tour, what to expect, etc. F ound the beer menu under the condiment caddy after pizza arrived. Never learn the servers name, she appeared to not know what was on the menu or have a sense of how to approach us, wanted to fill her order pad...
The pizza  looked great. The thin crust ordered was off putting due to the cheese piled on. There was so much; about six parts cheese to one part crust, that the crust that crackled when just cut, turned to a soggy saltine once cooled. The cheese is unamed on the menu, a mistake if the the local cheese factory is really involved...Silver Lewis Co-op names Sugar River as a customer.  Good to know if reality food is important.
The cheese blend is a chewy one, with the heavy hand on peril ing, once cooled after the second slice, the cheese returned to the original, pre baked mass intended to be melted. The cheese is unsalted and and mostly, if not all, a part skim mozzarella. Ok if you are not looking for it to be melted and digestible.
There was a marked absence of any type of personality in this restaurant. It looked unplanned, no decor, no history, no photos, no salt And pepper shakers...
They are located at the end of the block on seventh street and the website doesn't
Say much. 
They are a take out company that appears well financed to go into a sit down place. The smallest pizza with three toppings cost 15. And although tasty, the chewy over portioned cheese and no small Salad offerings put me at a disadvantage to recommend this spot. Should they get the menu and pizza construction lined up to a full service restaurant, they could be a great addition to NGlarus."}
{"text":"Our go to pizza place. We typically get it for carry out and the staff is always friendly and the pizza on time. Even though this is a pizza place, our all-time favorite dish is the spinach artichoke dip appetizer. The taco pizza is great as well."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews, I decided to try. Crust was dry and reminded me of a pre-made pizza crust I could buy at grocery store."}
{"text":"We decided to give it another try. It was a busy Saturday night and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait. Pleasantly surprised when we were seated in 15 minutes. We were greeted by our server right away which made me optimistic. We ordered the toasted ravioli and breadsticks to start. It took 30 minutes to receive them. They tasted fine, nothing special. We ordered a taco pizza and a cheese pizza and it was about an hour until we received them at the table. This appeared to be the standard around us. Our server rarely checked on us or offered us any drink refills. The taco pizza was delicious, the cheese was pretty standard. Due to the long wait, our server took 20% off our bill. In all, we spent 2 hours here. I would be hesitant to come again on a weekend- hopefully they can get the kinks of the inefficiencies."}
{"text":"Got some sandwiches and pasta dishes, everything was delicious & the prices weren't bad!"}
{"text":"Ordered hand-tossed crust pizzas to-go...one macaroni and cheese pizza, and one cheese pizza with extra sauce. The prices are a little high compared to what I'm used to in Illinois where there's a family-owned pizza joint on every corner, but the pizza is great for the Madison area (where I constantly struggle to find good pizza) and 2 XL pizzas can certainly feed a large crowd."}
{"text":"Waited for over an hour for a table with two little kids. Hostess had no idea what she was doing, slow service. Pizza was okay. First time here and was really hoping it was gonna be good. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Have to say that I've had mixed experiences here. Last night's pizza was amazing. Perfect hand-tossed crust that was crispy at the bottom and fluffy in the middle. Only recommendation is to ask them to go light on the sauce. I got a lot of it on my shirt. 

Tonight's starting at a bit more bumpy. Surprisingly crowded for a Saturday night, though I should have guessed that it would be. Not enough staff turning over tables to move folks in, so our wait was about 25% longer than it needed to be. Waitress was slow in getting to us to begin with, but she was friendly enough. 

These folks were hit HARD on the pizza line tonight. People coming in to pick up pizzas ended up waiting an additional 10-15 minutes. And they were getting grumpy. Probably wasn't the wait as much as it was the lack of useful communication by the young woman working the phone and the delivery line. 

Update: we have now been waiting for our food for more than an hour. Sigh. Owners never came to say anything. Waitress seems to have felt bad for it being able to confirm or deny that our food is actually being made yet.

Update 2: Was it worth the wait? Yes. The garlic cheese bread and mac & cheese were both amazing. The grilled chicken salad was excellent, though I'd recommend some additional veggies like carrots and cucumbers. And the lemonade was exactly what I wanted it to be. 

With all of that said, let's face it. These folks are serving great pizza and they're new. I expect them to have some growing pains. I suspect they were as surprised with the number of people showing up tonight as the rest of us were. I think they will figure it out. And I can guarantee you that I will be there later in this week."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious meal with family on Friday night! We enjoyed tasty appetizers, a fantastic menu of beer and delicious pizzas. Service was friendly. The Mediterranean pizza was awesome, along with the sausage pepperoni.
Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Was told how great the pizza was by my nephew so had to check it out.  Place is brand new and laid out nicely.  We were shown to our table quickly and reviewed our options.   Daughter wanted to try the mac and cheese so we got her that and we ordered the Tropic pie for ourselves. 

Pies came out quickly and toppings seemed to be adequate.   I give the crust about a 3, the sauce a 3.5 and the same for the other ingredients.   Daughter said Ian's mac and cheese was much better. 

Frankly, I didn't think it was much better than Papa Murphy.   And was triple the price. 

Might come back to try the sandwiches and other pasta, but not the pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the Italian Creek Meat Lovers, Buffalo Chicken, Kickapoo Taco Pizza, and Chicken Tenders for the dairy-allergy ridden.

The pizzas are heavily covered in cheese. Not a terrible thing, but it leaves little room for other toppings which were sparse on the Buffalo Chicken. The Meat Lovers is just that, layered with salami, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, sausage and bacon, it was by far the most popular pizza.

The chicken on the Buffalo Chicken pizza appeared blanch and tasted quite bland. It would be a better pizza if the chicken could incorporate some seasoning or a little buffalo sauce. When you bite into it, it was pretty much \"Hi! Hello! Hey! I'm white meat chicken!!\".

Since we ordered to-go, the romaine lettuce, tortilla chips, sour cream, as well as the salsa were packaged separately from the pizza as to not swelter the crispness of the toppings with the hot pizza. It had potential to be great, but again the cheese overpowered the rest of the flavors.

On the way back from picking up our order, we realized we didn't get the accompanying chicken tenders with our order. After a phone call to the restaurant, we were told that she had simply \"forgot\". *sigh* 

After doubling back, the \"tenders\"  were the only remaining hot items of the order. This was kind of infuriating since these kind of pizzas do not taste good lukewarm (again it might be the overpowering amount of cheese that turned hard). The tenders are not actual tenders, more like flattened pieces of chicken breast. Unremarkable, most likely not hand breaded or made in house.

When ordering, the gave us the option of beef or chicken for the Kickapoo Taco Pizza which is not noted on the menu. Just to keep in mind for those of you that crave a chicken taco pizza instead.

You have a choice of picking thin crust, hand-tossed, whole wheat or gluten-free for an additional $3. There was no discerning difference between the hand-tossed and whole wheat, both had the same thickness.

I recall the first time I saw them were their New Glarus entity that's located on a bike trail and always looked hopping. I'm glad to have tried the much talked about Sugar River Pizza, but disappointed I was not wowed."}
{"text":"I love the New Glarus location but this one is just as good, if not better.

DRAFT BEER! Yay! Nice selection of local craft brews and a good bottle list, too.

We ordered breadsticks and the Baked Potato pizza.

The pizza is pure, foodie perfection -- starts with homemade ranch and topped with waffle fries, onions, bacon and cheddar. We ordered the 10\" and it is more than enough for two hungry people. I recommend their standard hand-tossed crust. I love the crispiness of all the ingredients. 

Great for large groups. There is plenty of parking and seating here!"}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch a few times and enjoyed it   Today I ordered the margarita pizza. It might be the best pizza I've ever had! Pesto was delicious but not overwhelming. Lots of fresh melted mozzarella. The balsamic drizzle on top was really good, just the right sweetness to it. Try the margarita pizza, it is excellent."}
{"text":"The bar stools are the most comfortable I've ever sat on! I think that needs to become more of a trend...comfortable, PADDED bar stools with backs! 

Besides me loving their chairs, their food is delicious! I've loved their pizza since trying it in Belleville. The McDaddy Pizza (I think that is what it's called) tastes like a Big Mac and I mean who doesn't enjoy a Big Mac from time to time? The two appetizers we've tried were excellent: the stuffed cheese bread and the baked marinara & goat cheese! Yum Yum Yum. 

I also really liked their Old Fashioneds. It seemed like they were made with black cherries. On Friday they are 5 bucks! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"A couple couples visited here after a concert across the way at Wisconsin Brewing Company. We needed somewhere extremely convenient and many of the Verona restaurants are lacking. We found multiple tap beers that were attractive; one was on sale so we jumped on pitchers of that. It was fresh and all, not even bottom-of-the-barrel sale beer. The four of us split a ginormous half and half specialty pizza, which was somehow only 16\" - seemed much larger (yay). It was pricey (low $20's) but I guess all specialty pizza joints are nowadays. The waiter was cute, could likely tell we were drinking, and politely recommended we didn't do half and half. We continued anyway and were so satisfied. Half Amazon Deluxe, half Mediterranean. I would get either again, but strongly recommend the Mediterranean. We closed the place down (and may have stayed an hour over) but staff was very kind with this; I hope in time they stay open a little longer since options are limited around here. I plan to return, likely surrounding a trip to the brewery, and will try other specialties again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! We've been twice and love this place. Their taco pizza with beef is the best pizza I've ever had. Their cheese bread and chicken bacon ranch pizza were very good too. Great service both times and their porch is roomy if you'd like to eat outside. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"After a rather long wait for a waitress, everything was wonderful.  Cheese bread and pepitas were fabulous.  Pizza was good but we were stuffed by then."}
{"text":"Went here with the family last weekend.  The beer list seems to be varied and the menu has a lot of options.  We started with the pepitas which were AH-MAZING.  They came with home-made Ranch and were seasoned well and crispy.  It's a large order, so make sure you have someone to share them with.
We got two 12\" pizzas- the margharita and the BBQ chicken.  I recommend the thin crust.  Both pizzas were very good.  It was hard to choose just two options when so many of them looked delicious.
I'll be back again to try more of their specialty pizzas and get more pepitas!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place in the area. Haven't eaten at their location yet but have done carry-outs. All of their pizzas are unique and oh-so-tasty! Love their salads too (which are huge)! We have yet to be disappointed by any of their pizzas. Highly recommend the Asian chicken pizza. Slightly tangy with a hint of spice."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch on Saturday afternoon and we're truly amazed and pleased with the pizza.  We're 50 year Chicago residents who moved here 13 years ago and had yet to find a decent pizza in Wisconsin.  Well, our search is over.  This pizza had a fabulous crispy crust with a wonderful red sauce..and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and perfectly combined.  I'm planning on getting my husband to bring me back for my birthday in a week.  Can't wait to try some other items."}
{"text":"My friend had promised to take us to a supper club.  Unfortunately it did not work out....  So we ended up here!  I was not upset with this change of plan by any means.

We had a reservation.  When we arrived, they let us know that they were getting our table set up and that we could hang out by the bar and they would come get us when it was ready.  They did not make us wait too long, which was nice.  

They offer daily specials (Friday happened to be $5 Old Fashioneds).  A big YUMMMMM to the  brandy old fashioned (sour) I ordered.  It was beautifully garnished and had a lot of flavor.  If we were staying longer, I would have ordered another!  It was just so delicious (my mouth is watering as I type this....).

The restaurant is spacious and clean.  The section we sat in did not have an overabundance of tables, but each table had ample space for seating.  The booths are pretty giant and very comfortable.  You could really tell they cater to larger groups of people  I really liked the artwork they had hanging on the walls and the many windows they had, which made the room well lit.

We had prompt, courteous service.  Our server checked on us, got our orders in promptly, brought our drinks in a timely fashion, and was extremely helpful when we had questions.

Foodwise, we ordered the Goat Cheese Marinara Appetizer and Mac n Cheese Bites.  So good!  The goat cheese marinara was flavorful and the bread it came with was light and crispy.  The mac n cheese bites were nice and cheesy and packed with flavor.  The buffalo dipping sauce was quite tasty, as well.

We ordered 2 pizzas: The Mediterranean and the MacDaddy.  I liked both, but found the Mediterranean to be a bit salty.  I mean, it has kalamata olives on it; so, I am sure that's where the majority of the saltiness came from, but the salt level did not stop me from eating and enjoying it.  The MacDaddy was a huge hit at our table!  I admit I was skeptical about pickles on my pizza, but it was actually scrumptious.  I particularly enjoyed the crust of the pizza.  It was soft and chewy with a touch crispiness to it.

All in all, I think it was a great experience.  It only came out to about $16 per person (before tip) and considering we had appetizers, drinks, and pizza, I'd say that's a pretty darn good deal.  If I have friends who come to town looking for pizza, this will be at the top of my recommendation list for them!"}
{"text":"I'm so tired of being disappointed with them! Every single time! We've been ordering from them for years now and I'm finally giving up. Overly priced, first of all. And to continue, do not order roasted garlic on your pizza or you'll get huge chunks of raw garlic and handfuls of it. The ravioli used to be amazingly good but then someone decided it would be smart to add a ton of largely chunked green peppers to the sauce without mentioning that in the menu and now it tastes like salsa covered pasta. Their ranch is too dilly, and they need a garlic butter sauce. In the nicest way possible, they need to take notes from Papa John's. I could go on and on but you get the idea."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza, but not really wowed by anything.  The pepitas appetizers were okay, but a bit much and a bit greasy.  Not too busy for a Sunday night, but there was an unusual delay in getting a beer.  My wife got her beverage right away, but my beer did not arrive for another ten minutes when the appetizers arrived.   And I had to inquire about its current status to the server, who told me the bartender was very busy and that if she went to get my drink, she would get \"yelled at\" by the bartender...her words not mine. To which I said, \"would you like me to yell at the bartender for you?\"  Which I'd happily do.  A couple of minutes later, to my delight, my beer finally arrived. When we left the restaurant, I took a glance into the bar and noticed there were only about 8 people in there, thus her argument about it being busy didn't hold water.  But all-in-all, a pretty decent pizza place."}
{"text":"Meh.. nothing special.  Wife had steak sandwich which had a few measly strips of steal and was pretty greasy.  I had a small pizza which was ok but nothing to write home about. We split an order of wings which oddly enough were pretty lack luster.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"We stopped here for an early dinner after visiting the local pumpkin patch.  The one thing I absolutely  about this place is that they have scrabble tiles and crayons at the tables for kids to play with.  The scrabble tiles are different and therefore it keeps my daughter entertained the entire time we are waiting for our food.  Plus they use paper table cloths so she has tons of room to color if she decides to go that route.

I ordered a pizza with bacon and ground beef while my husband ordered the bbq chicken pizza.  My daughter ordered the kids Mac and cheese.  My pizza was good but ever so slightly overdone.  My husband seemed pleased with his pizza.  My daughter's Mac and cheese was a little overdone though.  I'm not sure if it was oven baked and the top was a little brown or if it was cooked in a pot and the bottom was brown.  Either way they stirred all the brown bits in with the rest of the Mac and cheese and my daughter gave me a look as soon as she saw it.  So I spent a few minutes fishing out all of the brown pieces before I could even eat.  Also, the kids meals come with a cookie and fruit snacks.  I would appreciate a fruit or veggie side and one \"treat\", not two.  

All in all Sugar River is a great place.  We have been fans for awhile now, frequently visiting their New Glarus location.  They always have fast, friendly service and pizza is always good."}
{"text":"My third time here, as well as two trips to the New Glarus location. I live nearby and am happy that there is a good eatery here. The food is very good. I've had a couple of excellent pizzas, but lately I'm hooked on their pulled pork sandwich and waffle fries. Health conscious wife loves gluten free crust pizza (so do I). But, best part is beer selection. Just had my favorite, Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout at happy hour for $3. Really? I know a Madison place that would charge $8 for that."}
{"text":"If the wait is more than an hour just wait longer.  Great staff and a growing new pizza place which this area needs.  Food is better than expected.  I'm picky and the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"We met with extended family, many from out of town for an impromptu dinner.  Of course, for most people, pizza is a safe bet.  In all 13 of us ate, but we arrived in separate groups, really straggling in over about an hour.  That really wasn't much of a problem because the service was slightly slow, so it worked out for this group.  Kimmi was our server and she was great for our group.  She broke the various orders into separate checks that worked for everyone.  We had different beers and wines for dinner.  Six pizzas and two a la carte entres were served.  The food arrived all at once and was hot.  
A word about the pizza:  they had about 2 dozen combos, 4 different sizes, three varieties of crust for over 300 mathematical combos; they had a selection of non-pizza items and appetizers.  The wine and beer menu was separate and covered a lot of ground.
The restaurant was clean and bright with a large bar area.  Many people had their kids but overall it was not very noisy.  We had a good time, we weren't rushed, the food was very edible and it cost about $15 per person including tip.  But remember, it is a pizza place not fine dining.  Solid 4 stars for the place, 5 stars for Kimmi."}
{"text":"A staple for pizza in this part of town, especially on a summer Friday night where you can pick one up and head across the street to the brewery.  We've been here several times now and it has always been pretty good. In the months following the opening of this location, it was pretty slow but that has improved a lot. There's plenty of seating but on a busy night you'll need to prepare yourself for a wait if you don't have a reservation. 
On this particular visit, not especially feeling pizza, I ordered the chicken Parmesan. Huge portion! I thought it a little strange that the chicken was served cut up already and also felt it was a little heavy on the breading, but the flavor was good and the pasta was cooked nicely. We always end up not being able to say no to the loaded waffle fries and these did not disappoint yet again. 
I've tried several different pizzas and they are good - average, I would say. I did think it was strange that the taco pizza was served with most of the toppings separate, on a plate, ala carte style, when I last ordered that. They do offer a gluten free crust but take care to mention that a true allergy may be a problem due to the presence of high gluten flour in the kitchen. Good beer selection and likely not to let you down overall."}
{"text":"Nice clean pizza place in what looks like a new building. Staff was super friendly and service was quick.

 The fried cheese curds were hand breaded and came with a ranch dressing that tasted like it had a bit of dill in it. The curds and sauce were paired perfectly with each other.

We had the kickapoo taco pizza and the pizza was excellent (being from Chicago and all..;)). It came with toppings (Sour Cream, Lettuce, Salsa, and tortilla chips on a seperate plate that allowed each person to add more or less toppings to their taste. 

Overall great experience and highly recommend if you are in the the area in general or are visiting the Duluth Trading outlet store."}
{"text":"By far the best macaroni and cheese pizza around - it's absolutely amazing. It gets even better when you add bacon. It's kind of sad I get the same thing every time but it's just so good. They also have a dessert (not sure of the name) but it's like little cinnamon donut balls - sooo gooey and worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"The  Manager Dennis was so nice to me when i came in there.  He helped me through my order. I needed help because i never ordered their before. The pizza taste so amazing. Great Customer Service."}
{"text":"We had heard food things about their pizza so my wife and I as well as my aunt , uncle and father from out if town went on Sunday night.  Sorry, but the following is completely 100% accurate.  We asked to be seated on the patio. This is a new beautiful building. Older, yet inexperienced and RUDE waitress sat us on rickety patio furniture. What happened next should have caused us to leave immediately. There were TOENAIL clippings in a neat pile under where my wife was sitting. On their patio. Bottom line, mediocre VERY overpriced pizza in a great building with very poorly managed and trained staff. Will not return. Recently heard one of their other locations closed. No great mystery why"}
{"text":"Love the food!  My favorite is the Macdaddy pizza! Great service and food. I have gone back a few times and will continue."}
{"text":"Yum!  Went here recently for the first time.  The pizza (hand tossed) was great!  Delicious sausage, too.  The kids liked their meals (pizza and mac and cheese) and we got a birthday dessert that was HUGE and good.  Might want to make a reservation since they were busy!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if I should give them four or five stars, but all things considered I went with the five stars because the pizza is great and the beer selection is spectacular!

First, the pizza: it's typical American style, heavy sauce and cheese pizza. They've got a great selection of unique specialty pizzas that would probably make a Nona roll over in her grave, but I have to say they were quite good. I highly recommend the Mediterranean pizza, even if you're a carnivore. Next time I'd like to try the pulled pork...

The draft beer selection is awesome, they've got a number of beers that I haven't found on tap elsewhere in the Madison area! 

If this place had a few more TVs, it could be dangerous--I'd be coming here way more often. Can't wait to come back in the summer and have a seat on the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town. From Sun Prairie, to Monona, to Middleton, to Verona, this is my favorite spot surrounding Madison. Food is great here and my wife and I order weekly on Friday nights.

I will say this place gets PACKED and I always order take-out (which can be 30-40 minutes on a busy night). I've dined in a couple of times, the atmosphere is fine and very clean, but nothing worth dining in for if you can just take it home.

Moving soon and know that I won't find another pizza place as great as this one :("}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say.  We had a large party with a reservation.  We arrived a little early, and they said they were prepping our booth.  As we had drinks at the bar, the nice greeter came over to us and said he was sorry for the wait, and that we would have an appetizer on the house!  We were seated before our reservation time; that was totally beyond necessary.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The pizza was excellent.  Well, let me clarify as a Chicago native:  it's excellent for Wisconsin.  Anyway, we were impressed with everything, and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I am from out of town, staying at a nearby hotel. SRP delivered my order directly to my hotel room, which was so nice. As an out of towner, I really just appreciated the service. The person on the telephone taking my order was very sweet, and the delivery driver was very polite. My order was on-time and the food was satisfactory"}
{"text":"Great pizza.
Service really slow.
Waitress really snippy."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! The atmosphere is really welcoming and the staff is friendly and caring. We went for trivia on Wednesday night and had a blast. It was our first time there and we are definitely going again!!"}
{"text":"Oh yes! GET HERE EARLY. this place, no matter what day it is, is crowded. At least a 30 minute wait. So, here's the inside scoop, order it togo and pop over to the wine bar across the way! It's the perfect timing and you'll enjoy the pizza with a nice little buzz and some netflix. 

Heres what you should order. 

- cheese bread: come on, with some extra garlic cheese sauce on the side or some ranch you really can't go wrong with this...especially the garlic cheese sauce... shall i say it again? 

- Buffalo Chicken: if you're craving this place will satisfy it to the max, but what you should really order is the

- Amazon Deluxe: while basic, this beautiful pizza is just the perfect combination of absolute grease, flavor, and sauce. I can't even explain the explosion of texture, savory taste buds, and overall just plain yum. 

I'm sure all the pizzas they offer are great and it is now my mission to try them all. 

happy pizza eating!"}
{"text":"Marina and goat cheese appetizer. Not bad, not great.  Basic marinara with goat cheese, baked. Portion size was good, and the bread served with it was okay. I feel like this would have been much better with a crusty Italian bread. And not enough bread for the quantity of marinara/cheese that came with it. The marinara could have been much better. This felt very standard to me.  I rank it a 6.

Pastrami Reuben-  one thin layer of pastrami, much more kraut. Served with waffle fries.  Toasted well, good temperature.  Skimpy toppings. Sandwich a 4-5, fries a 6-7.  

Ordered the Mediterranean pizza. Thin crust. I'll give it an 8, but for the price need to deduct a point for a solid 7.

Service- had to remind server twice about things we ordered that weren't delivered. Never offered a drink refill, and drinks were empty before meals arrived.  At the end of the meal, still no refills offered. Plates not prebussed. Done eating for about 7 minutes before she checks in, and had to ask for boxes to-go. Server was always polite, and everything else was lacking. 

They're new, so I will give them another chance. Right now I'm saying a solid 6. 

UPDATE-  ordered delivery today of (another) Rueben, stuffed cheese bread, and chicken Alfredo.  All dishes were incredible! Rating now at a 4 because the person who answered the phone clearly didn't know the menu, but if I could give a 4.5 I would. Much improved over my last experience, and excited to try another dine-in try."}
{"text":"The delivery area on their website doesn't accurately reflect where they are willing to drive when they are busy. Super disappointed in their customer service!"}
{"text":"Went to Sugar River Pizza after my wife got a gift card for bosses day. We ordered carry out and while waiting for our pizza we ordered soda and cheesy bread  with marinara sauce. After we ordered our pizza and appetizer, we sat in the bar at a high boy table. Staff were not very prompt in acknowledging our presence and it took about 5 minutes before someone came and got us our soda. It probably 5 more minutes to get our appetizer. The cheesy bread was good with garlic butter topped with cheese, but for cheese bread, the cheese was scarce. Also the blend, cheddar with something else didn't float my boat. The bread was tasty and the outside was nice and crunchy but overdone with very dark crust probably from having the bread in the broiler too long. Give me brown, but not blackened bread please. After some time we were informed our pizza was done and our bill arrived. Roughly $26.00 for a 14\" cheese and sausage pizza, cheese bread and 2 sodas. Not the worst deal, not the best. As for the pizza, the crust was not real thin for the thin we ordered, it was more like hand tossed. It too was well done, The cheese on the pizza was brown to black and too overdone for my liking and the sausage was so overdone it was crispy. The sauce was quite flavorful and the crust tasted good. I'm sure I would have liked the pizza more than I did, as well as the cheese bread if they were not so overdone. I probably will give them a second chance, and hope my first visit was a fluke and not the norm."}
{"text":"This place has great food and even better beer. If you are coming for trivia night or just to hang out, it is a great place! Recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Diverse, palate-pleasing pizzas and a whole lot more! We had the Asian pizza and the meat lovers pizza. Simply amazing.... No disappointments here!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza we have ever had. Many different varieties of pizzas to offer. My wife and I dined in the restaurant and had a great experience. Service was quick and helpful. One of our most favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We love this place! We have been a few times now and the food is definitely worth the extra wait time that you might experience. I think the reason there is a wait time on food or seating is because everything is prepared fresh. We were warned of this our first time in. The waitress said it could be a while for food... have a beer and order some appetizers and we were MORE than happy to do that. 

Appetizers we loved the mac and cheese bites and the marinara and goat cheese. Their wings were also surprisingly REALLY good! My mouth is watering just thinking about them.

Pizza is awesome with lots of different styles to try but I think the real dark horse is the dessert option that isn't on their online menu (and I'm blanking on the name)... It's like little deep fried pieces of dough rolled in cinnamon sugar on top of vanilla ice cream. I know it probably doesn't sound that great, but I'm telling you ITS AMAZING. We will for sure come just for dessert some nights."}
{"text":"I had the flatbread salad, so yummy with fresh spring mix on top of savory chicken flatbread under it.  Others got a half Greek salad, that was a generous size and a sausage pizza.  Would def. go back!  Very good service."}
{"text":"After my last review, someone reached out to me and explained that there was a problem with the oven calibration. So, on a desperate evening, I decided to give the Belleville location another try--and I'm so glad I did. I've only had positive experiences lately and nothings been over or undercooked, which I'm pleased to report. It also seems like they have some new staff in there and the few times I've been in to pick up pizzas, I haven't heard any sort of questionable conversation from the kitchen. 

Hopefully this continues because it's clear that they're capable of some really great pizza."}
{"text":"What started as a 1 star review turned into a review of redemption.

We came here today for Father's Day lunch, as we did last year.  The server took our drink orders and we asked for a few minutes to look over the menu.  I'm pretty sure he forgot about us, as it was quite awhile for him to come back.  My wife went to the bar, where he was pouring drinks and socializing. We had been waiting 20 minutes.   I hope things go better meal-wise, as this is not a good start.  I heard from another table that fathers for a free drink, but we were not told this.  The quote that suits this experience best is \"I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter\".  We also asked for glasses for our root beer and never got them. Another table's server asked what kind of crust they would like for their pizza, but I was not.  They seemed to have much better service.  

My wife finally had enough.  She went to the bar where our waiter was working on filling drinks and told him we were ready for our order to be taken.  He walked over to our table and took our orders without any kind of apology for not being more diligent.  After a couple of minutes, my wife finally got up and went to talk to the manager.  She apologized and said she would be taking over.  Suddenly we had our food and she checked to see how our drinks were and if we needed anything else.  After we were done eating, she came over again and apologized for how we were treated.  Much to our surprise, she also said our meal was on her, as well as offering dessert.  We were pretty speechless after this turn of events.  

Thank you Sugar River, for turning this experience around!"}
{"text":"Oooh, wow. We had the cheese curds, which were pretty good but the housemade ranch stole the show, it had such amazing flavor. We had a calzone (share this, it's giant!) and a 10 inch pizza that was half Mediterranean and half meat lover's. The pizza was delicious and the crust was flavorful. We had the cinnamon nuggets for dessert, which is criminally underpriced and should be a $10 dessert, not $6. Insanely good. If this was our local pizza place, our waistlines would be in trouble."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great cheese curds, great caesar salad, great service.  My one comment is that something in either ?their ventilation system or ?something else in the restaurant causes an allergic reaction, causing sudden sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes once we enter the restaurant, so we have had to stop going.  I'd be curious if anyone else has had this happen to them there--it's happened every time we've gone over the last 2 months, but never prior to that.  Only at the verona location, and the reaction starts prior to food or drinks.  Otherwise a fantastic place to go, complete with trivia night!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation using Open Table which helped immensely, as we just walked in and were seated, while others were having to wait 40 minutes. Extensive menu of pizza, salads, sandwiches and pasta. Both of us ordered pasta dishes and they were excellent with lots of leftovers. Prices are on the lower end, plenty of food for the $. Our waitress, Maggie, was excellent, attentive and very helpful with the wine list. Food was served quickly as we were finishing up our game of Scrabble.

Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"After drinking a little too much at the brewery down the street, my hubby and I thought we should probably get some food in our system to wear off our buzz. So, we walked over to Sugar River pizza for some dinner and had a great experience! The atmosphere was nice, service was great and pizza was delicious! We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Good.  Not great, but overall good.  The pizza is decent, perhaps a little higher in price than I'd expect.  The service was OK - nothing special.  And the interior seems somewhat bare.  A strange feeling place.

The meatlovers pizza was chock full of meat.  The mac and cheese just didn't do it for me.  Not quite sure why.  But it wasn't inedible or anything.  I tend to hold pizza to very high standards."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Verona. Our favorite pizza place used to be Glass Nickel, but Sugar River has taken the top slot. Great pizza and eating in is a great family stop, and a great beer list as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant located in a new building surrounded by ongoing construction is truly a great find!  My daughter and I ordered a Greek salad and a small Mac n cheese pizza to share for lunch. I have tried Mac n cheese pizza at other  places in the area  and I would say this is the best one I've had.  The crust had a nice consistency and the four cheese Mac n cheese was nicely browned. The order of beignet we had for dessert was huge!  Four people could easily share the plate that came accompanied by a nice raspberry sauce."}
{"text":"Went there around 5 on a Sunday afternoon. It was crowded when we left, but not when we got there.  Pizza was good as was the beer.  Our only complaint was the service. I ordered an ice tea and my husband ordered a beer. My husband was never asked if we wanted another beer and I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my tea, although  my glass was empty for most of the meal.  Lori was our server.  Will try it again in hopes that the service improves."}
{"text":"Oh come on!  No reviews for this place?  I don't believe it.  They have been in business for a number of years I believe.   They carry pizza, sandwiches, salads and pasta.   Everything we have ordered from them was delicious.  The pasta portions are large.   Enough to feed two sometimes.
The garlic bread is good but not fantastic.   
They are friendly and quick on service.   Belleville is lucky to have a place like this that not only makes good food but provides delivery.
Don't be afraid to try them out.

Update: 5/2015.  The pan tossed is acceptable but overall we feel their quality here has gone downhill.   We ordered a thin crust about year ago and it was a crummy crust thought the toppings were just ok.   We tried a thick crust recently and it was ok but nothing that great.  We've stopped ordering from here regularly because of the drawback in quality.  We have also tried some of their non-pizza selections and found them to be passable.

I guess the point is if I am going to order out I really want something special and though this pizza is certainly better than a store bought the price should carry with it some pretty mean flavors and ample amounts.  But it doesn't.  The crust is so important too and this crust is just average at best.

Update: 6/2015  The owner contacted me here at Yelp.  Bravo!  I raise them one star just for that and plan to order again soon to see if my pizza is back to what it once was.   I did order a pan-tossed pizza from their New Glarus location (which has a really nice place to sit along a bike path) and that pizza was quite good.  But I hope to see the Belleville location get back on track and will also try their Mac and Cheese to see if it is better this time.
Thanks for paying attention to the Yelp reviews.   It is important and too many businesses ignore what is on Yelp, Google and other review sites.   I use them all the time to decide where to shop."}
{"text":"First time there. Completely satisfied. Pizza was good. Had deep fried ravioli which was a nice appetizer. (Not amazing, just good but yes I'd get them again) Then, topped it off with beignets. Decent. Like funnel cake at the fair. And it was happy hour so the appetizers were 50% off. I would go again."}
{"text":"We came here hoping for a solid local pizza and we were not disappointed!

They take reservations on the open table app, which is super nice because there isn't a lot of waiting space. You can tell when you walk in that it's a new restaurant. It has the feel of a house that was just built. For how awesome the food is, a bit more decor could help the building stand out more for how unique it really is.

Beer list is a good size/variety and ideal prices. 4$ for a 16 oz totally naked from new Glarus!? Yes please!! It was also nice to see smaller portion/price options for appetizers, we were able to try the cheese bread which was delicious.

There were SO many awesome pizza options. We decided on the buffalo chicken and were very happy with it. Just the right about of spice, and lots of veggies to balance the chicken. The option for thick crust was awesome, since neither of us are fans of thin. We also noted they served gluten free crust. Not a huge deal for our family, but important for when we want to go out with friends. Heated up great the next day for leftovers!

Service was good, we had no complaints. We will be back to try Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"OK- After getting over my initial frustration about their delivery range, I decided to order carry out one night. Why did I do this after the experience I had last time? Because their pizza is that good. 

The menu is diverse, ingredients top notch, and the crust is the best we have had in Madison. 

Also, after airing my frustrations, the owner was kind enough to reach out to me and apologize for any confusion. That is something I will always love about small businesses, is when they show they care about their customers, and regardless of who is right or wrong, they reach out to try to make things better. Other than the one delivery snafu, I have nothing but good things to say about the other people I have dealt with at Sugar River. I really do hope they succeed, because that area of town is sorely in need of good restaurants. 

Oh, and did I mention the beer list? Wow, one of the best in Madison, and that is saying something."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I had a great time playing trivia.  The blue cheese was superb they say they make it fresh!! Everyone loved their pizza and pasta.  I did the 4 alarm it was hot had to cool it down with the blue cheese.  Will visit again on my next epic trip."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going here. I am picky about my drinks, but LOVE their moijito. The people are really nice and I always enjoy their food. I have had the salad, pizza, calzone, and pasta and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Started with the loaded waffle fries...loaded with bacon!! Kids boneless wings and 6 inch pizza were plentiful. We got the very tasty veggie Clearwater pizza (12 inch) and we'll have leftovers."}
{"text":"Sugar River has been a much needed addition to Verona since it opened. Their pizza is 'out of this world' good!!! It may be a tad on the pricey end, but I definitely think it's worth it. I have also enjoyed their calzones, flatbreads, pasta dishes, cheese curds, and toasted ravioli. Everything is top notch!! They use giant pepperonis, which just makes me extra happy (I really, really really love pepperoni)! If I want to tell myself I'm being healthy, I order the goat cheese and basil flatbread. The flavor is just incredible. I have taken advantage of the \"build your own pasta\" lunch special, and I love the smaller portion sizes so I don't go back to work feeling like a beached whale. Be advised that there WILL be a wait on Friday and Saturday nights, even if you place a to-go order, you may end up standing around waiting for a bit. But the employees work hard and do well managing the crowd. If you haven't eaten at Sugar River yet, do yourself a favor and give it a try!"}
{"text":"The pizza margarita is out of this world delicious. The pesto and balsamic make this incredibly unique. The mac n cheese is also very tasty."}
{"text":"The Vegetarian Pizza is incredible!. You can't go wrong with it and everyone. We bought our pizzas here and took them to the Wisconsin brewery down the street to have a few brews."}
{"text":"Came here because we had heard good things and also had a bucky book coupon.  Totally exceeded our expectations. Our server Erik was great! He gave us great suggestions and was so nice and attentive.  Pizza was Soooo good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great beer selection, and very nice staff. The wait can get quite long on Friday or Saturday, and a bigger bar area for waiting would be nice."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and old fashions :) Great service too! They have a great assortment of specialty pizzas. So many it is hard to choose!"}
{"text":"Solid addition to the Verona area scene. It's great to see local restaurants in suburban multi-use districts. We split a half Greek Salad and the meat lovers small pizza. Plenty of food for two of us - we even took a couple of slices home. 

The Salad was fresh but not really a traditional Greek Salad - it was enjoyable nonetheless. The pizza was delicious and mad  the trip worthwhile. I'll tell you what though - the craft cocktails were the highlight... the Maple Cinnamon Old Fashioned was delicious - not to sweet and nice and refreshing. Few places actually do a nice job with their cocktails, but Sugar River does. 

The dining rooms themselves are a bit sterile but we found the service to be really good and beat expectations for as busy as the place was on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I've eaten in twice and been pleased however, I just ordered delivery and am pretty disappointed. Asked if they could do a half buffalo chicken half pepperoni. They said sure. Double checked they could put buffalo sauce on half and marinara on the other. They said \"of course! I'll write it in all caps and with exclamation points too\". It had buffalo sauce on all of it. To add insult to injury they also didn't include the marinara sauce with the cheese bread."}
{"text":"I was a fan of their fare, but the people side of the business is a disaster. The newest location is 6 miles from home,  according to tonight's staffer. They won't deliver that far.  Frustrating, ridiculous and enough to write them off."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night after going to Wisconsin Brewing Company for some music. First time here, but the food was great! Three of us ordered the summer addition pizza which is the spring chicken. I want sure if I was going to like it because of the avocado ranch sauce (I'm normally not a fan of creamy sauces on pizza), however I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't have an overly creamy or too much of a ranch taste. The pizza is well balanced with a little bit of a kick and I would definitely order it again.

One of my other friends ordered the pear & gorgonzola ravioli. She was very excited about the dish and it didn't disappoint.

A highlight of the night was that since it was derby day, there were mint juleps and you got to keep the glass. They were very refreshing drinks to go along with our pizza. After the meal, my friend asked the waitress if she could rinse out our glasses so we could take them with. She ended up bringing us completely new glasses and said that we were the first people all day to ask for the glasses. Some people missed out...

Definitely excited to go back and try some of their other food options!! Also the table setup with having scrabble letters in a jar makes the wait for food go super quick."}
{"text":"It was not ready in 30 minutes, it was ready in 75. I don't mind it being late, but not more than twice the wait time you told me. You should have known pizzas weren't taking 30 minutes. You can't blame that on being super busy, which you were. If you drop my pizza on the floor and have to remake it twice, that's cool, but let me know so I can go outside and walk around or something. Don't tell me \"it's not quite ready yet\". I had a bored, complaining, squirmy kid along. I know that's a risk on my part, but I deliberately showed up 10 minutes late to begin with to hedge my bet.

I think part of it was that the teenage boys at the counter forgot about me and stopped checking for my pizza, even though I was sitting directly in front of them 6 feet away. After a long stint of answering phones for delivery and pickup, handing out pizzas to the 6 different takeout parties that came in after me and left before me, they didn't check the hot boxes to see if my pizza was there, they started wrapping up silverware place settings instead. When my pizza did come out, the pizza cheese had congealed, like this thing had been out of the oven for at least 20 minutes.

You also got my breadsticks order wrong, swapping out the one that was read back to me on the phone, and appeared on the receipt, and I was charged for, for the cheaper one. 

Takeout customers, I recommend not paying for the pizza until it's ready, so you can leave if you need to.

You are new and working out kinks, like communication between the back and front of house.

Sugar River, I owe you another review when I get a hot pizza, and you owe me 3 bucks for a breadstick downgrade and the tip I paid that front counter boy in advance."}
{"text":"Well, it's good to try new things, right? It's a nice looking building in the middle of nowhere. None of the many hostesses looked at all happy to be there. It took LONGER than the estimated time for us to get a table! And then they wanted to seat us at a high top - we were there with a 5 y/o. Good beer list but terrible wine list. Don't get the Chianti. Maybe I was just very hungry but it bothered me that the waitress struggled to pronounce some of the wines. 

But, on the other hand, our waitress was very nice. And one big plus is the large sheets of paper on the tables and crayons for kids to draw with, and scrabble tiles to play with. 

The food didn't come at all quickly, not even the kids food. However, there was a Badger game on, so perhaps they were busier than usual.

However, the pizza was very good. I thought the hand tossed crust came with too much cheese, the thin crust looked like it had a better amount. We got the Asian Chicken, which was delicious! The asian sauce was the right combination of sweet and spicy. The BBQ Chicken also looked good. 

This place is not at all near me, so I'm not sure I'd get take out, but lots of people were coming in to pick up to go orders. I'm not sure if you can make reservations, the hostesses seemed unsure if that's an option."}
{"text":"Best Pizza around! Quality ingredients and lots of options, I have yet to try something here I haven't liked! Our household favorite is the concord chicken bacon pizza! They also have a unique and delicious garlic cheese sauce! Worth every penny every time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Zombie Dust!  2 dozen beers on tap, and nothing is wasting a tap. Great beer choices from 3 Floyds, Toppling Goliath, Ale Asylum, Great Lakes, New Glarus, etc. 

Next time I'm in I'll give the pizza a try!"}
{"text":"Nice space, great service, awesome food! We split a half garden salad and got a half/half pizza on gluten free crust. Wait was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! Immaculate! Cozy Booths! Very Kid Friendly with the paper table cloths, crayons and Scrabble pieces at every table to keep the kids happy and quiet!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers pizza was excellent plenty of toppings really liked the amount of sauce cheese bread was very good service was excellent only disappointment was they use chicken tenders for the chicken parmeson it was good but would have preferred a whole breast the pizza certainly makes it worth a visit"}
{"text":"They deliver to the hotel- yes! Stayed in town for Epic training and felt like staying in. Had the Chicken Bacon Ranch salad and the cinnamon-chocolate bites for dessert (can't remember what they're called on the menu). Both were HUGE portions and very tasty. I would order again from here."}
{"text":"Good pizza and appetizers. Beers cocktails and wine are also nice and service is friendly. A nice casual place to go with family and friends"}
{"text":"I visited as a solo customer around 7 pm and it was quite busy.  Here are the pros and cons.

Pros: 
This is a nice new venue, small bar with a couple of TVs, nice decore and many seating options including a nice terrace.

There is a lovely selection of beers.

Con:

The service is poor.  A classic example of under trained, poorly managed young adults trying to do their best but not knowing what to do.  Well cleaned tables by the bus staff but the floor covered with dropped food.  Infrequent check ups from wait staff.

My order took close to 40 minutes and not one visit or explanation.  

I suspect the ratio of seats in the dining room is bigger that the kitchen can accommodate.

The pizza is a step up from Pizza Hut and Papa Johns but just barely.  The toppings are ample but the crust is soulless.  I asked my server if the crust was leavened with yeast and got \"I don't know but we have gluten free...\". I suspect that the dough is a baking powder crust.

There are better options in Madison and it is worth the travel time to avoid Sugar River."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very cool. The bar has some good deals and the best old fashioned I've had. They use absolutely delicious dark cherries in their drinks. Then, of course, there's the pizza. It's definitely some of the best pizza in West Madison. The airworthiness are pretty impressive, too. Really good food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, horrible service.  We absolutely love everything we have tried - pizza, wings, sandwiches and my personal fav, the hummus platter.  The problem is actually getting it and getting it right.  Time after time we have been quoted a delivery time only for that to turn into at least 30 mins later than promised.  Multiple times food has been wrong - missing chicken, wrong crust type, etc.   I will say they always make it right (if you can get them on the phone and not the answering machine) by handing out credits and bringing the things they missed but how many times can you try again and just hope it was bad luck.  Just to reiterate, amazing food but I suggest to dine in.  I can only assume the service must be better than delivery or they wouldn't be in business."}
{"text":"After waiting for over an hour for our order we got up and left.  Service was terrible.  Save yourself the time and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, appetizers (get the pepitas), and salads. The specialty pizza list isn't very aligned with my tastes, but you can always order a custom set of toppings to get what you like. Good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome ! Atmosphere is casual ! My girlfriend and I split a small tropics ( Canadian bacon, pineapple, red onion, green pepper ) hand tossed pizza ! We also got 2 side salads and order of breadsticks ! Salads were a good size and the lettuce was a good spring mix. The French dressing was delicious ! The cheese on the salad is a cheddar/mozzarella mix!  The prices are fantastic ! I highly recommend this place ! Our service from Ellie was superb!"}
{"text":"Gluten free crust!
Enjoyed a pizza here. Sat outside on a warm fall night with gf pizza and a beer. Can't get any better that that. Service was good too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza we have had since moving to Madison. It was extremely kid friendly. Scrabble and crayons on a paper table top. Wide variety. Lots of brews to choose from. Does seem to fill up fast. Was able to seat 8 within 5 mins at 6PM on a Friday. Shortly thereafter it was packed! Dan was the BEST server ever."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, beer is good. I am an overweight Wisconsin resident who enjoys both pizza and beer so you should trust my review."}
{"text":"Consistently great pizza. There's something about their cheese that is just right. Amazing flavor. Stuffed cheese bread is AMAZING. The place is tiny and does not have a dining room, so take out or delivery only."}
{"text":"Consistently friendly service & great pizza. Expect to wait for a table on busy weekend nights, but don't be discouraged, it's worth it. Bartenders never really seem prepared or excited about the volume of people wanting a drink while they wait, and don't seem to have a second or third gear to handle the rush, but overall we really like this place!"}
{"text":"Simple! I love their pizza. They offer wheat crust, which I suppose if you're eating pizza nutrition is the least of your worries, but every bit helps. Seriously though it taste great, the crust, cheese, sauce are all dead on. Their specialty pizza's are delicious, love the Tropic. I highly recommend this. 

Only draw back is there a bit more expensive than the chains, you get what you pay for though. They make it up in quality."}
{"text":"Reserved our table via the Open Table app. Kimberly did a great job with our order & refilling our water glasses. Friendly & efficient. Nice touch by giving us a water pitcher. Artichoke dip was a little thin beneath the toasted crust. The tortilla chips were stale. Maybe offer pita slices instead? Amazon pizza with hand-tossed crust was very good. The ambiance welcomes groups, large families with comfy booths. We'd like to comeback to try what's on tap & other yummy pizza varieties."}
{"text":"Quite an indulgence on Fat Tuesday.  The Pepitas were hot and cheesy, as was the pizza.  Nobody went home hungry!"}
{"text":"Never ever would I have thought that pickles on pizza would be good, but with the bacon cheeseburger pizza they are a must. They seemed a little short staffed when we went in during lunch but the food was great. My only regret is that their delivery area is so small."}
{"text":"Great food, beer and service! Worth the wait!
Try one of the specialty pizzas and a craft beer!"}
{"text":"First of all, don't go at off times, because the staff would rather be setting up for the next rush than serving customers. Walked in today, greeted by the friendly host, then taken to a back room which was deserted. We asked to sit at the bar instead where there were people and tvs we could see. He was very nice about complying. 
That's where anything positive ended. The woman behind the bar said nothing to us the entire time we sat there, and actively avoided eye contact. When another person went behind the bar and looked at us, I had to ask him for a drink. He brought iced teas with no sweetener or lemon. When my husband asked for both, he first brought lemon and set it down on a napkin. Then he brought 2 packs of sugar. Not sweetener. 
He then left and no one came anywhere near us, other than the bartender who continued to pretend we weren't there. 
No one asked us what we wanted, offered us drinks, or spoke until I directly asked for a drink. We left after a few more minutes of being ignored. 
Worst service I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"When I was looking online at their menu, there is an area to make a reservation with Open Table, thankfully I did so. When we arrived on a Friday night there was a 45-50 minute wait, but with our reservation we got right in. The place was packed with lots of families with small children, so the noise level was high. We ordered the deep fried mac and cheese and the Cheeseburger Pizza. The mac and cheese is really good! It is made with pepper jack cheese, so it has a bit of a kick and then deep fried in Spotted Cow beer batter. They came out piping hot and were gone in minutes. The pizza was really good too. They have small plates, apps, salads, sandwiches, pasta and pizza, so not just a pizza place.

Kimberly was our server and she is GREAT. She handled our section efficiently and checked in several times with all tables. When I asked for more water, she brought a carafe! Tables were cleared immediately after they were vacated - nothing worse than looking at a table full of dirty dishes when you are eating. One table by us had 5 kids, so at the end of the meal the area looked like a disaster. She cleared it off, swept up the mess on the floor and it was like they had never been there. Hope the managers know what a great job she does."}
