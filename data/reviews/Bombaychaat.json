{"text":"loved the spice level and Indo Chinese was amazing! will be back to try the south indian and kebab/ biryani.."}
{"text":"After sampling the delights of what Cleveland has it was very nice indeed to be able to sample the delights of a good curry. Yes the decor might not appeal to most people but it was clean and friendly. Unsure what to have the young lady who served got me a taster to help me make my mind up. Service was very pleasant and the quality of food excellent. For those Brits who need a taste of home in Cleveland this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went here after my wife's graduation and it took almost 40 mins to get my order. By that time mood was gone. Service needs serious improvement."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious and authentic. The service is great. Nice place and clean. The servers were very polite and kind."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for Indian food. I really enjoyed Mutton Briyani and Chicken katti roll. Yum Yum. It feels like you are eating in school cafeteria but it taste way too good. Definitely a must go place if you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Okay food, nice staff.
The problem was with inconsistent ingredients at times.
Has been very convenient for me and my wife as this place was a few yards from our apartment."}
{"text":"good food 
clean
reasonable price 
nothing fancy 
friendly staff 
i have been there multiple times 
will go again"}
{"text":"I've had a recent obsession with Indian food so I decided to try this place out. Super excited as I live about a block away! 

I ordered the paneer tikka which was really good. It came with 6 cubes of paneer and saut√©ed veggies. 

I was looking over the menu and I'm excited to try some of the other things on the menu.. Especially the dosas!"}
{"text":"Wow! Incredible selection of authentic Indian food as well as a sprinkling of indo-chinese dishes. The staff was friendly, as we're the other patrons. A word of caution, the seating seems to get taken pretty quickly, as it's a popular place. The serving sizes were generous, which makes most of the dishes a great value. The garlic Naan in particular was amazing."}
{"text":"So first thing I was pleasantly surprised with is how nice, neat, clean, and chique this place is. Yes. For an Indian restaurant that is not always a given. Even the bathroom is clean haha

The interior decor is trendy with a big mural depicting Mumbai with marathi (language spoken is maharashtra where Mumbai is located) inscription saying ikde tikde which I belive is slang for here and there. I'm probably wrong. I can read the letters but my marathi is crap. 

Menu is pretty eclectic with authentic looking and sounding foods along with amazing ice cream flavors. Decent price."}
{"text":"I've been looking for some good Indian food in Cleveland for awhile and this place was pretty awesome. While the decor is not the best and there is a lack of information on the menu, the food easily made up for any deficiencies. The chaat dishes were all large enough to nearly be a meal by their own."}
{"text":"Food was good but the paneer and lamb seekh kebab took a long time to prepare. I would advise to order ahead by 45 min"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place because I love Indian street food and haven't found a great place yet in Cleveland. But I was overall disappointed by this restaurant. The food was just average, and the ambiance was strange. I went on a Saturday night and they were out of many of their key menu items. I ordered the masala dosa, my go-to, but it was served cold and the potato filling was not made well. I would consider coming back for the buffet! But otherwise, I would go elsewhere for Indian food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We missed the buffet time but the dinner was still great. We had Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Paneer Makhani, and Dosa, with Naan of course. You can choose your spice level as well. Yes, we were hungry and ate all of it! All was very tasty! Definitely will have to go back and try the buffet. Adding this place to my top favorite Indian restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food that I can find in downtown. Staff can be a little courteous. Buffet is good but it needs refill faster. Chicken roll is fantastic. Pani puri is also delicious."}
{"text":"Love the pav bhaji at this place. Must visit."}
{"text":"Worst food. You have to dispose your plate after eating in disposal area. Everything is self service including getting food and drinks to your table and throwing plates after eating. I have never seen this type of atmosphere anywhere in North America. Since this place is next to Cleveland state university mostly students and university faculty who want to try something unlimited might go there. Customers belonging to the community of owner typically go there to fill tables in the evening hours and they eat a couple of items since we do not know we try according to our taste. Weekends esp. during days it is empty. They might even ask you to clean your table. Staff is very unfriendly. Good they didn't ask you to clean plates. Food is below average. Owner and staff attitude is very bad. Once I ate Pav Bhaji during evening hours and found that is probably the worst food I ever ate. I got loose motions and was sick for 3 days with body aches and diarrhoea Avoid this place it is not Hygienic. Most of the positive reviews on this site are placed by the staff or owner;s family members or friends."}
{"text":"Giving up hope after multiple times of making the trek here only to find a hand written \"closed today\" sign. Call before going....or try any of the other great Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  South Indian food. Authentic and delicious.  This is the spot for dosa.  Run to this spot.  You won't be disappointed.  They are super friendly,  the place is new and clean,  and delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The daily lunch buffet wasn't out the other day, sadly, and I wasn't sure why not... But even if you don't know what you're ordering, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Low quality food, dismissive service. We will never eat here again.

My boyfriend and I came in around 9:30pm for what we hoped would be a quick, flavorful dinner. First off, we were told that since they were closing soon (10pm) we couldn't eat in and had to get take-out. Um, okay, there were probably 5 couples still in the dining area, but we couldn't stay. Whatever. We had no idea what the dishes were (no descriptions on menus), so we had to ask the girl taking our order a bunch of questions. She was dismissive and continually not-so-subtly reminded us to hurry up because they were closing soon. We placed our order, waited for a few minutes, then got our food. Since we couldn't stay, we went home to eat. When we finally sat down to eat, we were extremely disappointed with the quality of food. I got the Malai Kofta, which I was told had cabbage dumplings. The dumplings were nothing more than fried dough with a few herbs for color; no cabbage in sight and very bland. He got the Goat Vindaloo. While the sauce was flavorful, there were maybe 3 bites of meat in the whole container. Everything else was bones and fat. Seriously, there was a whole vertebra included with no meat attached. Our experience with the service and the food was so poor that we will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for some take out on the way home.  The trolley and us stop right in front.  The food is very good.  Prepared on the spot.  Definitely heed the warning for the spicy stuff.   They aren't kidding but it's good stuff.  The only complain I have is that there's no descriptions of what the menu items are.  I would try a wider variety if I knew more about hat's in the various stuff on the menu.  There's too much to ask the server about everything.  A detailed description might peak my interest into ordering something new.  I'd also like more info about hen the buffet is offered.  I don't see anything on the website other than 'lunch'.  Overall, a spot in my rotation."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is such a jaw-droppingly good deal that all other concerns go out the window. The buffet selection is surprisingly plentiful, with classics like chicken marsala and all sorts of unique dishes I couldn't name. There's never enough naan, but I understand - their naan is really, really good. 

I'm giving them 5 stars because the lunch buffet is really just that good - but I have a difficult time imagining that I'd want to come back much outside of the lunch buffet. I've only done it once or twice and I was not impressed.

TLDR: Best lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Nice interior and the food (chicken hakka noodle) was good . however, i feel like it's over priced $8.99 ($6.50 would be fair price for the portion)"}
{"text":"All of the warm spices and colorful flavor of Indian food delighted us in our first visit to Bombaychaat.  My brother who knows much more about the culture and cooking of India invited us here while their lunchtime buffet was served.  I was glad to have the opportunity to try quite a variety of dishes without having to figure out how/what to order from the menu.  That means, however, that my review cannot include the names of the dishes, but here's my advice about the buffet:  try everything!  The curry-enhanced vegetable-chocked soup was a comfort food. Chunks of boneless chicken swam in an orangey-red sauce that was abounding in flavor.  The lamb was moist and flavorful, in a different sauce.  My brother lives in the loft apartment building where Bombaychaat is located, so he eats here frequently.  If I lived in Cleveland, I would too!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Fast service!! Friends and I always go here. 

Price is great. Portion sizes are good. Haven't come across bad service yet. This is a fast place to go to if you're craving delicious Indian food. 

My go to Samosa Chaat"}
{"text":"I had never had Indian food before, and for New Years my family and I like to go find restaurants with cultural foods. Bombaychaat was a great place to first try it! My parents didn't know what to order, so service was very helpful to let us know what everything on the menu was. Our food came quickly, and was SO delicious! I love spicy food, and it was just that. Good flavor, many options, and nice atmosphere. I highly recommend you try it! (:"}
{"text":"Good Indian street food- something Cleveland didn't have. Lots of vegetarian options. Reasonably priced. Quick service. 

They don't serve all menu items if you go during their lunch buffet hrs so if you wanna try items from their menu- go in the evening."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot.  They had menu items I'd never had before. We tried one which wad like a big fritter or pancake with mixed veggies fried into it.  It came with a variety of sauces to dip in.  They told us it would take 20 minutes to prepare, but it came out right away with the rest of our food. It was a hit at the table.  I ordered the spinach curry dish with chicken.  I don't remember if they called it palaak or saag, but the names seem to be interchangeable on menus depending on the restaurant.  Theirs was delicious, and my brother was very happy with the food he'd ordered.  I will go back and sample something else next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's so close to my work/school at Cleveland State University so that I can stop by for a quick meal.

INDIAN STREET FOOD! It's a great addition to Cleveland. The inside is energetic and colorful with lively wall murals of street scenes and shiny emerald green facades. When I've come in the afternoon for the snacks, they are usually blasting Indian music too! I've come here a few times for the street food starting at 3pm. The first time, I accidentally got there slightly before 3 and sat there counting down the minutes until I could eat this delicious food! 

I've had the pani puri (little puffs with potato filling and sauces that you can put on top), the aloo tikki (croquette), and the stars are the DOSAS!! They are amazing and very fun to share with a group of friends. They're lentil based \"breads\" filled with a typically vegetarian filling with some sauces that you can dip it in. SO DELICIOUS.

Much of it is very vegetarian friendly.

I've also tried the Indo-Chinese food which is the type of food Chinese people serve in India! I had a cauliflower dish that I grabbed for dinner to go, but it seemed to me to be more of a family-style shared dish (didn't come with rice.)

Note -for lunch, they only serve buffet from 11am-3pm. Like others have said, the buffet is what you might find at other Indian buffets, crowd-pleaser type of items for the American palette. When they first opened up, I remembered there being more spicy and flavorful items which I really enjoyed, but since then, I think they've decided to mellow it out."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today as I was looking forward for months to their opening. There are too many signs for a nearby apartment building where their signage should be, so don't drive past! They have a lunch buffet which is an agreeable addition to the choices near CSU. Wish it had been there when I attended evening classes. The restaurant is new and very clean. The staff is friendly and happy to explain everything. Other items are not available during buffet time and include dosa, yay. The food was good, and spicy, which is what I prefer. There were several options with salad, two chicken entrees, paneer and veggies, two kinds of rice, naan and dessert. All the meat they serve is halal. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Fabulous!! We decided to try this place while visiting Cleveland based on good reviews. Since we reached late they could only provide takeaway, however they were smart in recommending options that will taste well later as well. We tried a bunch of stuff and everything was very well cooked, blended and ultimate treat !!!"}
{"text":"FAR better than ANY other Indian restaurant in NorthEast Ohio.  Scratch that.  It's far better than any other RESTAURANT I've tried in northeast Ohio.

Their lunch buffet is fantastic and certainly a great value.  All you can eat for 9.95.  The food is high quality and they offer a great selection.  It's actually such a good value that I wonder how they make a profit...lol.

They serve Chaat after 3 PM and before then it is buffet only.  The Chaat is pretty decent as well, but chaat isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"A nice find for an informal Indian meal. Dinner at Bombaychaat was a pleasant experience. We ordered  Chicken 65 and Dahi Papdi Chaat for the appetizers (with Taj Beer). Both items were good although we preferred the Chicken 65. We were told it was a house specialty. So if you like spicy chicken this would be a good dish to try. My husband had the vegetable Uthapam (a thick crepe made with rice and lentil flour) with a lot of vegetables. The uthapam was well made and tasty and the Sambar (which could have been hotter) and chutneys were flavorful as well. I had the Choley Bhatura which is a traditional North Indian street food (fried puffed bread with chick peas curry). The choley was well seasoned (you can order it at varying spices) and the Bhatura was fresh and fluffy. The cost of the meal (with Beer) was quite reasonable. The place is clean and the service good. We will surely come again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I have no complaints what so ever. My favorite spot downtown now. As a mostly vegetarian, I find the buffet has more than enough options. My omnivore coworkers say the chicken is phenomenal as well. Can't get enough. Seriously, the buffet is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here and ordered some Vada Pav Burgers and it was garbage. It was nothing but potato salad somehow molded into a burger patty (by the grace of god I have no clue how they did that), dipped into some batter and deep fried. Then they dumped a shit load of this sweet sauce on it and some mint sauce on it. I'm not eating there anymore."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here during the lunch buffet, but I love it. I often find myself craving their food, probably the best Indian food I've had in Cleveland. The only downside is I think the buffet is a tad on the expensive side, especially for lunch and for its location where many customers are students."}
{"text":"Food taste okay. We tried the veg Manchurian and gobi manchurian. They are undercooked and the size of the machurian ball is pretty big but the gravy does not penetrate the manchurian to give that taste and flavor. It's more doughy inside and dry. Improvement needed on both manchurian dishes."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get lunch if you don't mind spending a bit more.  The buffet has a nice selection and everything is fresh and tasty.  They don't pull their punches when it comes to spiciness, some of the dishes were too spicy for me (admittedly, I don't have a great tolerance for spicy foods) but I would rather have that than go to a buffet where everything is too mild and lacks taste.  The price isn't terribly competitive, the buffet is a bit expensive even for downtown but it's a nice break from routine and much closer than the other downtown Indian restaurant, Mirch Masala (over by the casino).  You can get the buffet for takeout, at which point you are charged by the pound but I wouldn't recommend it because it's very expensive.  The one time I got take out, I would say I only took about one third of the food I ate when I ate in and it ended up being almost the same price.  So if you want take out, I would recommend getting pickup from Mirch Masala (plus their butter chicken is better anyways) as you will get a better value for your money.  Oh, many reviews have already stated this but this is a serve-yourself environment, there is no wait staff.  You get your own food and drinks, you clear your own table.  This is not a problem for me but I think it decreases the value of the meal, especially considering the already slightly-elevated prices."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in town.  Food is flavorful and always fresh.  We eat here a couple times a month and we have never been disappointed. My wife is Indian and this is her go to for food that reminds her of home.  I personally like the indochinese food.  Their gobi manchurian is incredible as is the samosa chat!"}
{"text":"This is the street food fare of India which is available here in Cleveland under one roof. The ambience is nothing fancy. Its a self service place but on a Saturday evening with the restaurant half filled the service suffered and was way too slow. One had to make multiple trips to the counter to get the items on your menu. Which was definitely annoying. 
The quality of the food can be a hit or miss based on what you order. The special bombay bhel was the best. Idlis were  steaming but the chutney and sambar were not that tasty. The rava dosa which were the most reviewed item was passable. Be aware of the whole peppercorns that you bite into while eating it. The chicken tikka kathi roll was nothing great (ps if you want a good chicken tikka roll go to kabob place in westlake). The chicken chilly was tasty and spicy but on the other hand the chicken fried rice is nothing to write about. 
Overall worth a try but not worth revisiting unless you have exhausted all other options or if you're in a mood to try their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Mumbai Street Food !! 

This place was crazily filled with a whole load of items which are in the Mumbai Street Food menu !! 

It was a very tough choice to select what to eat !! But thanks to my big group of friends .. Each of us selected a minimum of 2 dishes each and Presto !! What do I have .. A big delectable fare with almost all the items you can ever imagine !! 

Each and everything was well prepared .. Chaats , Dosas , Noodles and the street Chinese food !! No words to describe the smiles and glowing faces of ours once we tastes it all !! It's a must must visit for all who are close by and passing through !!"}
{"text":"I didn't have very high expectations for this place, as I figured it to be more \"student food\" oriented. Glad I stopped in. Fast-casual with a large and tidy eating area. It had a mix of families and younger people, which was a good sign. The prices are reasonable and portions were generous. 
Unlike some reviewers, I thought their sambar is one of the better I've had in a restaurant and if you are going to be a respectable South Indian place, you need to get this right. It was not too heavy or oily and perfect on the flavor. I also ordered the egg biryani and it was flavorful and pretty decent for this type of dining experience. 
This place is good for quick, tasty South Indian style food at a decent price."}
{"text":"mmm so good! went for lunch buffet. lots of vegetarian options. it's right by the new amazon@cleveland location so i go there to pick up stuff and eat :D"}
{"text":"Critical addition to the Cleveland brown food scene. Chicken 65, chicken tikka masala, samosa chaat, and garlic naan are really great. Two thumbs up (pun intended)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet. Food is neither tasty nor quality is good. Buffet starts from 12 pm, but if you reach their after 2, they don't refill dishes specially desert dishes. When we reached there, it has rosomalai in desert. But when it got finished, they replaced it with Kher, which felt like rice in milk."}
{"text":"The name Bombay \"Chaat\" doesn't do justice to this place. Except for the Chaat, I really love all items on the menu. One of my favorite places to eat Indian food in and around Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is another indian gems. Absolutely, i am not indian. I used to like whatever indian buffet and thought that these were real indian food. Apparently, they ARE NOT. After i have tried some good real indian restaurants (real as confirmation from my indian friends), i am addicting. Bombaychaat is one of them. Food make me feel fresh. Tasty and very delicious. Only problem i have is the parking because the downtown location. 

I like dahi puri and vada...something (cant remember the name). Mongo lassi is also awesome. I never had buffet because it is only weekday."}
{"text":"This is by far, my-to-go restaurant when craving for some top quality indian food.
Food was absolutely scrumptious and well-balanced in term of spices. Upon trying the buffet i thought it would be just like any other decent all you can eat restaurants in the area but this one in an exception. 
Food was fresh and very reasonably priced. 10$ for the buffet.

Will definitely be regular to this place."}
{"text":"What?!?! Great Indian food in Cleveland? Wow! This is better that our favorite South Indian restaurant in San Francisco Bay Area... visited for the NBA finals and craved for ethnic food.  Score!!! We ordered paper dosa, puri, aloo chat.  If we ever come back to Cleveland, we will be back to Bombaychaat.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Can't wait to go back.  Came here on a Wednesday for lunch. Super! 2 lunch buffets were $21 ....water all around. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here recently during their lunch buffet. Was a little disappointed that they didn't have any of the chaat items (pani puri, dahi puri, etc), but what they did have was yummy!  Other yelpers have raved about the naan - they were right! It was fluffy, fresh, and had just enough crunch.  We didn't get there til after the lunch hour and they were still making fresh food, which was nice.  My mother was there and she approved of the food, which never happens so if you're looking for good Indian food, check this place out.  My other faves were the mutter paneer and dal makani.  There were some chicken options as well, but as a vegetarian, I can't attest to those.  Also, I thought the price was reasonable since you're definitely going to leave with a full belly.  I'm looking forward to returning after 3pm to try out the chaat items."}
{"text":"Dosas are SOLID AND HUGE. Highly recommend getting any of the vegetarian based dosas, they're like Indian savory pancakes or crepes."}
{"text":"The food still remains rock solid, hands down delicious!
A few more must try items
1. Schezwan Hakka noodles & schezwan fried rice. The noodles can be a little oily. 
2. Mango lassi.... Mmmm good!

Another must know: spicy in their terms is truly spicy!

Still haven't made it to their South Indian menu... Someday!"}
{"text":"Amazing, really cheap. Everything we ate was delicious, especially the pav bhaji & chole bature."}
{"text":"Off a recommendation I gave this place a try. I think in the downtown area at least, it's one of the better Indian places around. I called ahead and order garlic naan and Chicken Tikki Masala. (Spicy) . When I got there to pick it up , I still had to wait about 40 minutes for my order. However I think the food was well worth the wait. I ordered take out and I'm glad I did because on the Saturday night when I went it was packed and just about every table was filled. I'll for sure give this place a try again. Also I hear the buffet is pretty good as well so I will have to give this a try."}
{"text":"The chicken 65 was good the first time.  Mild has enough heat, any higher spice level is too hot for me.  Chicken was a bit too oily and spicy the second time.  Dosa is inconsistent.  Sometimes the filling is separate sometimes inside the dosa.  The onion masala dosa was loaded with a bunch of barely cooked onions.  I liked the onion rava dosa better.  Maybe ask for onions on the side instead.
The bombay special bhel was delicious.  I want to try the samosas, hakka noodles and chana batura next.

Things ive liked:
Bombay special bhel
Chicken 65 mild
Onion Rava dosa

Things i havent liked:
Onion masala dosa
Chicken 65 medium spice level"}
{"text":"I generally love this place and was excited when I saw they were coming to Euclid Ave. 

Here's a short summary of what I like and what I don't like:

LIKES:
- Great buffet selection
- Up to one pound you can get it for $6.99
- I got quite full from spending $5 today 
- Very delicious savory foods
- Great location across from CSU

DISLIKES
- Portions on non-buffet menu items are ridiculously tiny
- Customer service is hit or miss. Ive been there five times now and the service was great three times, once was so-so and another time I had to ask to be served
- The slush flavor I had (strawberry) reminded me of robitussin. Disgusting and threw it away.

My recommendation is to stick to the buffet and select what you like. It's priced at $6.99/lb. The butter chicken and naan are delightful. There's a spicy potato dish that tastes pretty freaking awesome too."}
{"text":"Great place for Indian snacks/appetizers! Finally, CLE has a chaat shop!! Had a number of Indian friends (from India) recommend this place to me, so I had to check it out. The place is located on the corner of Euclid and 21st street. It's clean and large, so it can accommodate groups of friends. **TIP: skip the buffet, the other dishes are more worth filling your tummy with!** We began our lunch with aloo tikki, which is similar to croquette...where potato (aloo) is fried to crispy goodness, and on top yogurt and mint sauce is added. The potato was seasoned, and fried well; I just wish I had more on the plate to eat! We also tried the pav bhagi, which is a vegetable curry served with buns. The bhaji was cooked well, with lots of spices and chunks of vegetables. It's the best bhaji I've ever had, but solid. My friends got the dahi puri, which if you've ever had pani puri...uses the same crispy shells...but they add yogurt (dahi means yogurt). This is a great snack to try when you want something light to munch on. This is also the only place I've found in CLE that prepares it for you. Usually they sell the crispy shells in the Indian stores, but you have to prepare the fillings and water/sauces. We also tried the chole bhature, which is chick pea curry eaten with a fried puffed bread. The chick pea curry was seasoned well, although I would've preferred the chick peas to be softer. This dish is very fulfilling because the bread is actually thick despite the deceiving light look of it. My friend also ordered the masala dosa, which was a little disappointing. The aloo filling inside was under seasoned. The exterior was crispy which was good, but I found the inside filling to be bland. Perhaps it was an off day for dosas? Lastly, my friend ordered the Hakka egg noodles to try. Usually I'm quite hesitant to eat any sort of Chinese food outside of Chinese restaurants (yes, I'm a bit of a Chinese food snob),
but we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed their stir fried noodles. I do have to say though, not a Hakka dish (the Hakka in me had to say so ;p). Overall, great place to eat, especially for vegetarians and those looking for great Indian snacks! I'm so happy though that CLE has a chaat place! And everything was priced fairly well! Finding street parking wasn't too hard, and most important...no one had bathroom problems the next day! I call that a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"An amazing night Indian place with authentic dishes. Also infused a menu of Indo-Chinese food that is fabulous flavorful and most of all consistent. One of the best lunch buffets in the city from 11-3 all you can eat for 9.99 or 7.00 per pound togo. You love healthy food, this is your place."}
{"text":"tried the lunch buffet, and enjoyed the food. However, 3-4 entrees (two w meat), no chutneys observed. Chicken used in the dishes was odd ... large uniform square white chunks.

Be aware for $10, you serve yourself (water, plates, etc), and you MUST clear/bus your own table or the staff will yell at you from the back, as you leave! (I had no idea you needed to do this... a first at a buffet for me). Plenty of staff just hanging behind the counter, take pics with other friends that show up and occasionally run some food out to the buffet. Very unfriendly staff. ( I also noticed a table of Indians who left all their used steel plates and plastic cups/utensils at their table ... but where never called out on it.)"}
{"text":"Really nice chaat. Nice ambiance and the favors are close to originals. 

Had the dosa, chola tiki and Bhej.  All three were very tasty."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Indian restaurant I have been to in Cleveland.. Everything on the menu is simply awesome! Chaat tastes like authentic Mumbai chaat, true to the name.. This is my third visit to the place and would highly recommend this place.. Staff are very friendly and always cater to spice levels and are very receptive to feedback. Ambience is excellent, very nice interiors! I could give them 10 stars !!"}
{"text":"Bombay Chat is not too bad. I went with two of my friends for dinner, two weeks ago. They have a ton of choices which are classic Indian street food. The only problems I had was my food wasn't spicy enough and small portions. I'll be back thougj"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet there. It was great. Especially the chicken biryani. After a long time, i had an authentic chicken biryani. I liked it so much that I took take away.  The chicken tikka masala was great too. There was a lot of variety in the buffet. There was Gulaab Jamun for desserts, Palak paneee, veg kadhai, butter naan and few other things."}
{"text":"Food: I was glad to see a wider than average range of options including South Indian items like dosas, uttapam, idli and vada. These lentil flour based items remind me of trips to India. I wanted to order them all, but went with a dosa which was packed with masala potato filling and had a hearty flavor with just enough spicy heat. I'm also a fan of Indian-style Chinese dishes, but will have to come back for those -- just glad that I found them here!

Service/Atmosphere: It's a fast casual place, which was clean and well ordered. There were plenty of tables which I imagine fill up from the Cleveland State University crowd coming for the lunch buffet. I like the metal trays -- also common in India -- so they fit the part well. Service/cashier was quick and patient with my ordering. I was having trouble choosing and not over-ordering."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the better Indian restaurants in the Cleveland metro area and the only one that serves Indian street food. I've been there for both lunch and dinner. 

What's great:
- Lunch buffets have a lot of options (both veg and non-veg) and it's yummy!
- The restaurant is kept clean
- You can judge the quality of the food by observing the chefs temperament. Been there numerous times and the kitchen staff and others are all friendly and get along well.
- Now to the food: Paneer roll, Paneer tikka masala with naan bread, Plain Dosa, Dahi Puri, Veg Biryani (spicy!!!), Navratna Kurma, Veg Uttapam - are all fantastic and the taste is consistent every time I've visited
- My go to place for quick and tasty Indian food in Cleveland! 

What needs improvement:
- Mango lassi is just too sweet for my taste
- Lunch buffet setup; one of the warmer stand shares a veg and a non-veg dish; which can result in contamination of meat into the veg dish if a customer is not careful with the spoons. These should be separated to provide an ease of mind for the strict vegetarians
- Some of their lunch desserts are made with eggs; labels with this info would be beneficial"}
{"text":"The art of creating and serving Indian street food is as comparable to the delicate ratio of ingredients that go into pani puri water. Any Indian will tell you that it's generally the secret ingredient of sweat that makes authentic Indian street treats so delectable (as nasty as that sounds!)

So will you taste the sweat at Bombay Chaat? It's unlikely. But there's hope for some hard work here. You'll find that it's nestled in a great part of the CSU campus. I'm not a local but it was easy to get here and fairly easy to find. It looks like they're working on signage, but they've got a great location. The insides, from what you can see in the other photos, are fairly modest and have the potential to have a cool vibe when there's more business.

On this afternoon, there was just a trickle of business with me being the first to step in. A menu on the wall greets you in foyer to see if you really want anything there. You order your food way in the back (as you pass the buffet if the time is right). Luckily they have a menu on their website with prices, so I definitely appreciated being able to peruse before going. 

OK GREAT... you ordered and the wait is minimal. There's no system really on how you get your food. I just sat and expected I would be served... perhaps I expected too much! But your food is given at the counter √† la fast food. When I was alerted to get it by a kind employee, I was both excited and slightly dismayed by the sight. I ordered the pani puri and dahi puri (check out the pictures).

The pani for the pani puri was sloshing on the tray, which can be messy, I'd have preferred it was served in a more controlled way. The puri did not get soggy under the water which is good, but I found the filling to be lacking. It was opposite for the dahi puri, as there was a lot of yogurt, but equally less filling like in the pani puri. 

Let's do some math, because other reviews have already touched on portions. You get 8 pieces of pani puri and dahi puri per order, total of 16 pieces. At $5 per order, it comes out to be roughly $0.62 per puri. My inner Indian is screaming at the poor value of this. Any sensible, regular Indian street food eater knows that this stuff never fills you up for how much you can eat. 8 pieces for $5... is laughable when you can find other fares that give you similar per piece meals that go for 10-20 pieces for $4-5.

In a word, Bombay Chaat was underwhelming and I only go with the three stars because there's plenty of work to be done. They have great potential though with that location. Maybe implement some better pricing, especially for the street fare (think increasing per piece meals, 8 for $4, 10 for $5, 12 for $6 etc... or even mix and match chaats). I would give it another chance just to see if they get the ratio of the fare/service right like their pani."}
{"text":"This place got us through a year and a half while living downtown! Food is great. Only concerns are that the staff is awkward sometimes, and they use a lot of disposable products (with no recycling bin). Otherwise very clean place and great food"}
{"text":"I visited this place after reading the reviews. I was highly disappointed with the food and customer service. After looking at their menu online, I called and a lady took my order for Chicken Tikka Kebob (I verified clearly), Hakka noodles, dosa and chat papri. When I picked up the order, I saw that it was chicken sheesh Kebob. I told one of the employees and he said he will talk to the lady at the register who took the order. I was starving the whole day, so I took a bite of the sheesh Kebob to see if I wanted to keep it, but all I tasted was eggs. So I went back after waiting 15 mins to the guy, the guy at that time went and talk to the lady. She apologized saying they were busy so she typed wrong and so they'll remake the chicken tikka order. She also took the chicken sheesh Kebob from me. Again I waited 20 mins this time. She sent a girl to get me from where I was sitting. When I went to her at the register, she tells me I owe $8.99. I asked why are you charging me for a order you messed up, that too after taking away the sheesh kebob. Also if she was going to charge me for her mistake, why did she apologize for it and offered to remake the order? If she had told me at first that she was going to charge me to rectify her mistake, then I would not have wasted my time waiting! She said, \"you said sheesh Kebob on the phone, and you ate from the order\". At that point, I became furious. This lady took my order wrong after I repeatedly- clearly- verified and said \"Chicken TIKKA kebobs\", made me wait while starving, takes away old food and then charges me!! I just left- didn't even take the sheesh kebob back. All the employees/manager (if existed) were watching what was happening to me, no one stepped in to provide any customer service. I like Indian food, that's why I went to try this place, but this place has not only disappointed me, but made me bitter about going to Indian restaurants. When I came home and tried the other ordered items, it was disgusting. Going to this place wasted my time, money, and my day. I seriously think the reviews are fake written by employees who are all from the same family."}
{"text":"Moving from NJ with a large Indian population the food I am finding in cleveland doesn't live up to my expectations. I gave this place a shot, I got dahi puri and a podi dosa. The dahi puri wasn't anything special but still good. A little too sweet for my taste. The dosa was probably the best I've had in the mid west. The sambar wasn't great but it'll do. My friend got butter chicken with naan. The gravy tasted very good. I will be going back often not that I have found a place that can actually make Indian food. I've heard the biryani is good"}
{"text":"Finally a goood indian restaurant in cleveland . good ambience . not expensive ! must try place"}
{"text":"Decent place for a fast casual Indian food. We went in for some snacks so were not able to try their buffet. Overall good food but they could improve on their lighting and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I have never tried Indian food.  Used yelp to find a buffet to try different dishes. This place no longer has the buffet on weekends. Went somewhere else"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian places in Cleveland and conveniently located next to the Amazon@Cleveland drop-box by CSU.  I really like their Dhosa, chili chicken, and puri chaat."}
{"text":"Authentic, excellent. HUGE portions. 2 will feed 3-4 people. Friendly staff and clean location."}
{"text":"We had food catered from Bombaychaat for my son's grad party for 300 folks.  Awesome Experience!  Menu: Five types of live Dosa with Sambhar, Coconut, tomato and Garlic Chutneys, Menduwada, Rasaam and chutneys, Imli rice with Lemon Achaar, Gobhi Manchurian, Live Aloo tikki choley chaat with Sev and Chutneys, everyone's favorite Pani Puri with Pani's fountain and Yummy Kulfis (Malai, Pistachio and Avocado).  Excellent crew to work with, the owner is a sweet Indian Lady Helen Patel.  The food was excellent as it name says BombayChaat, it gave us a little taste of Bombaiya and Ahmadabad Style Chaats along with South Indian touch for Dosa, chutneys, Rasaam and other items.  Probably, every other guest came to tell me the food choice and taste both were excellent. Many of us have decided to come to ur restaurant to eat in a groups.  Thanks to Helen Patel and her team!

{"text":"We have been to Bombay Chaat a few times when visiting town. Always enjoyed the food! This time around I decided a write a more detailed review. During our recent visit, we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was buzzing with activity, students and families enjoying a late lunch. The establishment needs some \"warmth\" or just something to make it more inviting. However, I guess the important thing is the food. We ordered Veg Hakka Noodles, Papdi Chaat, and Chicken Biryani. The portion for each entree is enough to feed two people. The dishes were freshly prepared and tasted that way. We ordered all of the entrees with medium spices but they still have a kick to them. The Papdi Chaat was one the better chaats that I have tasted. It was not watery, contained the right ingredients. The Hakka Noodles did not last long, devoured quickly! The biryani had good size chunks of chicken, although I was not fond of the boiled egg. Everything was good!!

Bombat Chaat offers South and North Indian Cuisine and Hakka Chinese. Really a very good variety for both veg and non-veg eaters. Service is fast and parking was not a problem!"}
{"text":"This is our to go place when we want to have good food without burning a hole in our pocket. They are based at a nice location which is near from the major attractions of the downtown.
The place is nice and clean and the food is one of the best you can get in Cleveland. Without doubt,they have the best vegetable and egg biryani in town. I always get an extra biryani for the next day when I come here. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. I have recommended this place to a lot of friends and all of them have positive reviews after their visit.
A frequent visitor....... ??

Their must try dishes :
Paper masala dosa
Biryani
Ragada pattice
Idli vada
Vegetable Hakka noodles
Chili gobi
Mango lassi

All the gravy dishes come with a good amount of fluffy white rice"}
{"text":"Stellar food.  There is so much flavor in every thing you order.  We go here for lunch quite a bit and it's one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"We went there to eat the chat, but were informed that the chat would only be served after 3:00 PM. I wish it was mentioned somewhere online and I wouldn't have gone. We were forced to eat their buffet. 
The buffet was very boring for vegetarians. Only 3 choices, which is the least I've seen anywhere. The appetizer and dessert options were worst ever.
The lady at the counter was very uncooperative."}
{"text":"I hail from Bombay and this is my go-to-place whenever I am craving some spicy chaat and other delicacies (which is quite often). I have savoured the papdi chaat and khasta kachori in the chaat section. These had the right mix of the unique ingredients and the spice level. My suggestion would to be to go for the highest spice level possible (if your palates can handle it ie!). 

The dosas are hard to miss and I have simply enjoyed having an onion rava sada dosa and still craving for more of it along with the coconut chutney which they offer. Most recently I had the vegetable biryani (highest spice again!) and it was sumptuous and completely filling.

I have also tried the Gobi Manchurian in the Indo-Chinese section which may need a little bit more spices depending on who you ask. Overall, a restaurant you must visit, especially if you wish to try different cuisines from India all under one roof.

Finally, a shoutout to the friendly staff there who always accommodate my requests for something off the menu even during busy buffet hours."}
{"text":"Great food  (I ordered the brown chicken curry with coconut milk instead of regular dairy) with white rice and it was excellent! Very friendly service too"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cholle Bhature and the immediately came back the next day to order it again because it is that tasty. You have to go up to the counter, order your food, pay, and find a seat. They will call your order up when it is ready. You can also call them ahead of time to place an order for pickup if you don't want to seat inside.

The cholle bhature is chickpeas served with puri (deep fried bread). I wanted to eat something vegetarian so this was a perfect choice. I first heard about this menu item after my roommate, who is Indian, told me about ordering it and how she loved it. I've had chickpeas before and I've eaten different types of Indian breads before at other Indian restaurants. The chickpeas was very well seasoned and the bread was super soft. I got the chickpeas mild but you can also order it spicy if you want. My friend and her husband ordered the Chicken Biryani and they loved it. Also, when I ordered this same menu item again, I realised that the chickpeas has little pieces of onions inside and I hate onions but I still managed to love what I ate. I'll probably order a rice dish next time. 

When I ate inside the restaurant (on Friday, 22 June 2017), I was treated to dinner by a friend who was visiting from Chicago. We both got the Masala tea and she mentioned how the tea was one of the best she has had recently. I thought the tea tasted fine actually but that's because I needed sugar inside which the servers didn't add (no problem). 

The inside is quite large and there is a beautiful painting inside with the words \"Bombay Chaat\" written on it.

I recommend this place. Everything was so delicious and service was goos.

This is my 125th Yelp review overall. 
79 reviews for 2018.
I am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018.

{"text":"Nice cool looking restaurant. Had a modern vibe to it. I am from out of town. Figured I'd stop by to grab a quick lunch before heading back. Loved every single dishes ordered. Mysore dosa was my favorite. It's hard to find indian street food in most of the Indian restaurants around so this place definitely excites me."}
{"text":"Mmmm good Indian street food.

Upon recommendations from friends, we ventured to the new Indian street food restaurant at about 9pm one night. Thank goodness for places that stay open later at night!

The restaurant is nestled off of Euclid, right on the corner. We easily found parking at the meters on the street perpendicular (this also was the case later in the week, when I came for the lunch buffet).

The restaurant has an interesting menu- Indian street food, regular dishes and then Indo-Chinese dishes. We chose the chole bhatura- puffy bread with a chickpea curry- so delicious!! That puffy bread was so good. We also got the paper dosa which was gigantic, but also good with the sauces it came with. Mmmmmm...

Later on in the week (upon recommendation to my coworkers), I was sent to pick up some dishes to bring back for lunch. However, I found out that between 11am-3pm they only serve the lunch buffet and ONLY the lunch buffet. Bahhhhhh. I mean the buffet is ok, but I really didn't think it was that great and that the meal dishes were much better. The buffet had an assortment of different dishes- paleek paneer, spicy gourd, butter chicken, etcera.. But I really honestly prefer the meal dishes. Don't bother with the buffet... Plus it was kind of pricey (for takeout it's $6.99 a pound... Probably the last time my coworkers send me out to pick up the food!)

Luckily, after much asking (and me, being Asian and not giving up), they did make some chaat food for me-some Bombay bhel, samosas, and tikki. It was sooo good.

I'm a huge fan of this place- just skip the lunch buffet, come after 3pm and order the meal dishes. Good spice level and quality food- can't go wrong! Next time, I really want to try those Hakka noodles...!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Just across the street from Cleveland State University. I visited here when attending an event at CSU. It was very crowded and noisy. But food is tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"Found my new Indian place!! Affordable and delicious ! Very authentic !! I got the butter chicken garlic naan and samosa chaat  the bread was soooo good esp dipped into the utter chicken! Samosa chaat was to die for I just loved all the flavors!! Def coming here again ! And I love that everything was halal! The only down side is they don't know fluent English. We got by but I asked for extra cilantro on the side and they didn't understand but if that' the price I got to pay for delicious food I'm good !! The restaurant was clean which is also a big plus !! Def coming here again !"}
{"text":"BC is downtown CSU campus hang out spot for indian street food. We have been to this location countless times, it's our favorite. 

They do have a little bit of everything, which is nice. For example, they have Gujarati street food (Mumbai region), they have south Indian food and Indochinese food as well. I am a huge fan of the Indochinese food, my favorite (as you can see in the picture) is Chicken 65 and the chicken fried rice!

Having tried several Indian restaurants in the area, these guys do it right. But someday are better than others. I think they suffer from lack of consistency from one chef to another. The last time we were there (Saturday night) my food was great, but my wife and father in law felt like the food was just bland. Other times we have great food with no issues, but this sort of thing happens. I don't believe it's going to be perfect every time. 
They have a buffet at lunch and its cafeteria self service style. Find a seat then go to the counter to order food and they will call you when it's ready. They have a really nice selection of Indian beers as well. You HAVE to go if you are into indian food."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was pretty good. The meat was of decent quality. I have been twice and both times a nice variety. If i worked downtown it would be a regular lunch stop. Unfortunately they do not offer the buffet 7 days a week. India Garden in Lakewood does. That is where I go."}
{"text":"Yuuum! Food was really tasty. Only 4 stars because the food in the buffet was not timely refilled. Otherwise, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food. Pretty much everything on the menu is good. Buffet for lunch is great as they rotate the dishes."}
{"text":"The 4-star rating led me here to experience some good Indian snack. All the food was pretty ordinary and meant to please just the starved students and those unfamiliar with Indian food.
The vada pav was served in a bun, pani puri had almost no filling and served with garlic chutney for spice. The sambar and chutney served with the dosa were lacked any taste or flavor just as the dosas.

Does not qualify to represent Indian or Indian street fare even in Cleveland ...."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the $9.99 lunch buffet one day. Until 3pm they only have the lunch buffet - you cannot order off the menu. You seat yourself in the spacious restaurant, pay first, and then help yourself to the buffet and free water that is in pitchers on the tables. They have a cooler off to the right of the register with other drinks too ($). 

The buffet was well stocked and replenished during my visit. The food was hot. There was one dessert option. There were no descriptions of the food, but everything was labeled. I enjoyed everything that I tried, and had a few favorites that I had seconds of. One of the things I had seconds of was the Chicken Tikki Masala. I am of fan of this traditional dish and it is my usual go to order when I am faced with an Indian menu. I currently like this dish best at Indian Delight in Gordon Square. I like it better than the one Bombaychaat serves. Bombaychaat's lacked flavor. Now I know for a buffet where the masses, must be pleased the dish can't be too spicy, but I think they could have done a bit better. 

All in all you cannot beat the value. You definitely do not leave hungry as there is plenty of food and a variety of options to please. 

The decor is also a bit off setting. Definitely not cozy or what I think of as \"Indian.' It was very bare bones, not warm at all and painted brightly with neon green and neon pink decor...and many paper seat yourself signs taped to the wall."}
{"text":"This place is a great value and serves some awesome food. The $9.95 lunch buffet is a guilty pleasure of mine whenever I work downtown. Only three things keep them from earning 5 stars: variable quality, most days there's delicous buttery naan and zesty tikka masala but others there's burnt toast and chicken in tomato sauce. Sometimes the buffet can't keep up with the lunch crowd. And no carryout during their very long lunch hours. 

This place is brand new and has some kinks but is definitely a place to go!"}
{"text":"There aren't many Indian options Dowtown, and this is the best for lunch w/buffet. It was surprisingly good and lived up to the other reviews. I assumed it would be an Americanized college fare based on the proximity to CSU, but the food is authentic and Deeelish ;)"}
{"text":"Full Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on Indian food, I can't speak as to whether this place is \"authentic\" Indian street food, I can't remember the names of what I ate or tell you if it is North Indian or South Indian food. 

What I can tell you is that for $10, I left here with a very full and happy stomach and eager to return. I chose the buffet because I was a little overwhelmed to choose something from their expansive menu. I wasn't disappointed with the buffet, they seemed to have a decent selection for lunch: two different rice options, two different vegetarian options, two appetizer/snacking items and two chicken options. They also had fresh naan. The curries weren't mind blowingly flavorful, and to be honest I have had Indian curries I've liked better, but it was good, stick-to-your-bones food and you could fill your tray with whatever you liked best. The naan was better than I've had elsewhere- very substantial and chewy and soaked up the sauces well. Service was friendly and there is plenty of seating inside. 
If you need a quick lunch and you're really hungry, I think this is a fabulous option, and I love that we are getting more diverse options around the CSU campus other than hamburgers and pizza. Would definitely recommend to others to stop by if you haven't already!"}
