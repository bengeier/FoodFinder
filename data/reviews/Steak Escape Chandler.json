{"text":"Ive been to this place 5 times within the last 4 months and each time its been an amazing experience, this place was on my sh** list since the holidays but I felt the need to comment and give respect because this is easily now the BEST place in chandler mall to eat!! Please Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. First off, the staff were extremely rude and looked like they hated life. I get it, working fast food sucks. But they had no respect. Ordered a meal, only rang up a sandwich. Also ordered a different sandwich in a wrap and got it as a normal sandwich. When we got our food, we opened it in the car and the sandwich completely fell out of the wrapper and was all in the bag. Then the other sandwich was smothered in hot sauce to the point that the bread was completely soggy. We ended up throwing the sandwiches away and getting firehouse subs."}
{"text":"The food is worthy of a 5 star rating. It is consistently so good and their fries are to die for.

However, their service is horrible. They were dead and I said \"hi, how are you?\" and the employee didn't even smile at me and just said \"what do you want?\"

I would understand if they were busy, but the mall was dead and I was their only customer. The team proceeded to ask me short questions (while mumbling I might add) such as \"length?\", \"drink?\" ,\"fries?\"

And their customer service is consistently lacking. I just want to get a delicious cheese steak without feeling like I'm a burden on the employees for being there."}
{"text":"Always slow. Never consistent. They Have never gotten an order of mine correct. It's the least busy place to eat in the mall and it takes the most time to receive your food."}
{"text":"Terrible place never comes to eat here employees are not  washing hands and touching the ladders and in serving food right afterwards without washing their hands..... talk to the manager and manager acted like a completely rude and says that have a policy in place saying they wash their hands...  I clearly watch the guy behind the counter not wash his hands Service the food second of all they don't want to give me a receipt of the food that I just order because they clean the printer is not working and he's the manager of the store or the onwer of the store and they can't get a printer to work and then they want to get my text information and my email not giving this company any of my information. And they claim that they don't have a boss 

Terrible place to order never again......."}
{"text":"YUM! Love the wrap option, makes for a lighter meal! All food prepared fresh on a grill right in front of you. Delicious! Great fast food option,  without the fast food taste!"}
{"text":"Just eat here if you want to get sick! 
The employees never wash there hand while the hold cash they were same cloves 
The fryer full of stain 
The food taste depends on what you prefer to add or prefer so nothing special about it"}
{"text":"The lady at the register was rude af and the lady giving us our food? Practically threw it at us. Won't be returning here again"}
{"text":"Staff needs personal hygiene and stop touching their greasy faces ,scratching your heads,then the food we eat.How are you people still in business seriously!Where is the health Department protecting us from your lack of cleanliness?
Substandard  beef jerky quality beef.
GROSS US OUT FOOD! 
PIG SLOP CUISINE!"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could. For $14 I would expect the food to taste good. The meat was chewy and too much cheese whiz. Service was horrible.  Only 2 people working and a line of 7 people. The one guy wasn't helpful at all. It probably took 20 minutes to get my sandwich. Hire some people!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Asked for a small Philly (5.39) plus the small meal fries and drink (1.00) extra. Ended up getting a medium and a large drink. Total was beyond what I expected- 11.53. 

Philly came with no bell peppers or mushrooms. The gal didn't even asked me what I wanted for extra on my sandwich. Overall, fries were disgusting and philly was okay at best. I think the best part of my meal was the drink. Overpriced and won't be back."}
{"text":"Did not get what I expected or as shown on the menu pictures. I ordered the Original Philly and fries. The fries were soggy and my Philly was not a Philly. No bell peppers and yellow cheese. Not to mention I had more bun then meat. The plus was the Lemonade and the girl at the register who was pleasant."}
{"text":"Food was good but did not receive what I had asked for. I wanted the crispy chicken nugget meal in hot buffalo sauce and instead received it as a sub. My friend ordered hers with extra cheddar cheese slices on her order and instead they put shredded cheese. Still tasted pretty good, coworkers just didn't seem to know what they were doing. We also did not receive a receipt or ask if we had wanted one or not."}
{"text":"So freaking gross. Waited 20 minutes for soggy gross fries. Horrible Customer service and i got a HORRIBLE stomach ache. Ewww never ever again."}
{"text":"Super long waits and upwards of a 1/3 the portion of your food goes to waste while they are cooking it. 
Food taste pretty good though."}
{"text":"The customer service at this establishment is very unacceptable and I will NEVER come here EVER again. I came here to get some french fries and my experience was completely terrible. They take the old fries and out it right back in the deep fryer with frozen fries, how sicken is that and they also don't use gloves. The fries they were about to give me dropped on their dirty counter and the cashier picked it up with her bare hands and put it right back in the container they were trying to give me. When I brought it to her attention that I didn't want them and that I wanted a new batch she refused to do anything. The guy cooking began yelling at me saying that they sanitize everything and I shouldn't say their counters are dirty. I literally showed them their counter were dirty and pointed to the dirt that was all over the counter. I asked for a refund and while it was being processed the employees kept yelling at me saying they're clean and to never come back. I don't understand how this business is up with this kind of customer service. This place is completely disgusting. I've already contacted the Health Department and their management offices so hopefully this place closes down eventually because it's mind blowing how they treat people."}
{"text":"I went here expecting mall food-court food, and that is what I got (not complaining). Fries lacked flavor, but my buffalo sandwich was exactly what I was looking for.

The customer service behind the counter was pretty bad though. Effort looked to be at a low and everyone looked to be having a miserable time. A long line grew at the pickup line but none of the employees seemed to mind that. Just seemed lackadaisical the whole way through."}
{"text":"Steak Escape is a nice three star meal at the Mall. It's not gourmet, or a real competitor to the Philly Cheesesteak places nearby. But I enjoyed it and it was a nice change. 

I've given up on how many iterations this concept has gone through. It's your basic chopped beefsteak, add onions, green peppers and cheese onto a hoggie roll, or sub. You can add lettuce, tomato and Mayo, but then my friends in south Philly wouldn't be speaking to me ever again. LOL

I paid the two dollar up charge for extra meat. One of my petty annoyances with fast food places these day. When you cannot change the prices you charge, then just cut the meat thinner, or put less on. Grrr 

All and all not a bad place, and it didn't upset my stomach a few hours later. LOL. So Three Stars, A-Okay."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often and I'm usually satisfied with the food and service but not today 8/5/17. 

As we speak, the two guys running the grill are jerks. I've never seen them before so they may be new as I come often enough to recognize people working. The Hispanic lady who is always there ( sorry, I don't know her name) is always nice, helpful and quick. I saw her ask these clowns to do stuff and they were quick to responded with a no and some attitude. Then they would mumble to each other as if we all can't see through the glass. They're so mono toned Christopher Walken sounds enthusiastic. 
They also messed up my simple request of adding mushrooms to my sandwhich. Although, that could have been the cashiers fault. He was new and didn't know exactly what he was doing. Which is fine, we all have to start somewhere. Steak esacpe, these guys are not good for your business. They are rude and lack basic customer service skills. Let's put it this way, I'm glad they cook the food in front of you otherwise you mind end of with a tainted sandwich."}
{"text":"Not so good. Probably one of the worse phillys ive had. Neither my husband or I finished our sandwiches. The sauce tasted gross, and the mayo was bad. Bread was good though. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"I was hungry in the Chandler Fashion Center and was looking for a quick bite to eat, but not weigh me down.  As I was walking around in the food court weighing my options I stumbled upon Steak Escape.  I saw sandwiches and wraps, and they had a variety of sizes.  Looked good to me!

I went up and had a hard time making a selection, all the choices sounded delicious.  eventually ended up going with a small Boom Boom with Steak as a wrap.  I got it with lettuce and tomato, and no mayo...yuck.  I like how they make it on the grill fresh, and make sure the cheese is all melty!  My first bite was mostly tortilla, but the next was delicious.  I don't know what that boom booms sauce is, but there was a delicious boom in my mouth.  Personally I could go hotter, but it still had some heat.  The steak is like philly cheesesteak, thinly slices, and I would have preferred to have it thicker, but that didn't stop me from inhaling my wrap!  My friend had the Chipotle sandwhich with turkey and love hers!  I had a small fries as well, and simple and delicious. 

Overall, if ever I'm in Chandler Fashion Center I will probably come back for bite to eat.  The staff was great!  So friendly, and they put up with me standing there being indecisive about what to eat for like 5 mins!  (Thank goodness there wasn't a line)  Sadly, there isn't an establishment like this back where I live in Hawaii, and I'm scared that I will have cravings for this!"}
{"text":"If you want a good lunch, definitely the place to go. Makes it right in front of you & the customer service is amazing. The groups they have working are always on the ball. It's amazing!! Love this place!! Always a recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome and stuff is friendly and cheap prices get the philly cheese steak sandwich"}
{"text":"My wrap was mostly lettuce and tomato. They asked of I wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo. If I didn't say yes, I'm not sure what the wrap would consist of. I needed some protein and I hardly got any. 

Southwest sauce was good, though."}
{"text":"I am sitting here looking at the food I ordered, not being able to eat it because my fries are a mix of over cooked and raw. My sandwich has so much sauce on it that I can't taste the meat which I guess covers up the fact that the meat was over cooked as well. I guess I should have known better when I saw the guy who was preparing the food wipe his dirty gloved hands on his even dirtier apron several times. Not to mention the grill and utensils were coated with food build up. I always tell myself not to judge a book by its cover but this time I should have. It's a shame I loved eating here when I was a kid when we went to the mall."}
{"text":"The Steak Escape gives me great food, prepared in front of me with fresh ingredients at a great price. 

I don't go to the mall often, but when I do, my wife and I will stop here for a steak sandwich.  I ordered the Bacon and Bourbon with jalapeños and my wife ordered the classic with jalapeños. We couldn't finish the large size and took it home.  It teased our senses then delivered with fantastic flavor and texture. 
I watched several orders be prepared with fresh, crisp veggies. The meats were chilled not frozen. 
I love coming here because I can see them prep what I will be eating. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Menu has been updated and new owner really cares. My new favorite place at chandler fashion square to eat. They have grilled turkey and chicken which is awesome!  Love the food here and the staff is great!!"}
{"text":"Three employees on staff. Pleasant , Good customer service.
Sandwiches made right in front or you.
Ordered the Triple Cheesesteak. They offer lettuce & tomato I went without. Would have been nice to have green bell pepper cooked along with the grilled onions? That's a better option in my opinion. It does come with three cheeses including provolone & a melted cheese sauce. It was pretty good , but felt a little pricey! Two sandwiches ( steak amounts are pre measured & frozen when placed on the flat top) fries and one drink was $21.00... We discovered the \"boom boom\" sauce that we requested on the side; it was really tasty & we dipped our sammies in that for additional goodness."}
{"text":"Loaded fries with bacon and cheddar mmmmmmm. This place tastes great the owners work there and it is fresh fresh fresh. I had the boom boom with mushrooms and a loaded fries with heaven on top! Strongly encourage you check them out."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and it was great. Recently went and got a sandwich and payed for extra steak but when I got it there was almost no meat so I asked the manager if that was was how it was supposed to be and she assured me that was the right amount of meat. It was pretty much bread and cheese. Never going back."}
{"text":"The steak itself was good cooked fresh the bread however was too small for the sandwich.subway probably would have been better it just didn't do it for me!"}
{"text":"Tried Steak Escape at the Chandler Mall for the first time. 

As a native Philadelphian, I'm tough tonplease when it comes to cheesesteaks. The touristy/stereotypical \"wiz\" is an option here... But, um... No. 

I went with the bourbon & bacon steak. It has onions & American cheese as well the sandwich was $7.69 and I made it a combo with fries and a drink for $3.59 more. 

There were not a lot of people in line (it was 2:15pm), and I started talking to the lady at the counter. I THINK she & her husband (who was also there) were the owners. Everyone there was super nice. The steak was being made right in front of me. A good experience. 

So how was it?  I thought it was really good!  The steak/cheese/onions were spot on. The bourbon sauce was nice and sweet (I always put marinara on my cheesesteaks, this was a nice variation)!

The downsides? Maybe a little more meat could be put on the roll, and it's hard finding the right rolls, though theirs did the job. And the fries were soft (my personal preference is a little crunchier). But they seemed freshly cut from the potato. 

So I can't give them 5 stars, but good food...A nice experience.... And I'll return."}
{"text":"I've never been happy about eating \"mall food\" before I discovered Steak Escape. I am a mall employee so the fact that there is a place that will grill fresh chicken and put it in a wrap quickly for me means a lot. I also appreciate the low prices since I find myself here almost every day. The employees are usually pretty conversational and friendly despite being busy. The food is delicious and best of all its FRESH. I highly recommend the sandwiches in wrap form with the boom boom sauce! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Showed up at the advertised opening time and was told they weren't opening for another 30 min because \"he wasn't ready\". When I told him that the purpose of having an advertised opening time is to open on time, the man waved me off and said \"whatever\". 



Nice. Good job Steak Escape Chandler"}
{"text":"I would've given zero, but then I wouldn't be able to review. 

This review is base in the services provided by the employees working. 

We only ordered a small fry and the buffalo fries, waited about 15-20 minutes. Now I don't mind the wait BUT these two immature males decided to skip our order and make the lady behind us order first. Now nothing against the lady but because what she was wearing attracted the two employees eyes. He tried flirting with her and what not but that gives him no excuse not to make my order. He happily handed her food to her and then they both stood around and gave us attitude while asking us what we ordered. HELLO it's in your system ! 

Like how long does it take to scoop some damn fries out and throw it on the plate and hand it to a customer. They're services today made the food taste 10 times worse. Would never spend another penny here again because of the services."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food or service because there wasn't any. 

Evidently, this location closes 30 minutes early today because the employees had cleaned up and wouldn't acknowledge customers."}
