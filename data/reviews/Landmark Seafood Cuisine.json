{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday because my brother in law said he tried it and it was ok. Price was good. $2.88 for SMl size dim sum but most of the dishes were extra large. Do prepare to pay the actually higher price. Service was ok, busy servers but al least they respond so no complains. The manager I met was someone I know from another restaurant so tea charges exempted. Food was ok for the price because at best mediocre. Why I will never go back again? I was charged on the bill a TABLE CLOTH charge of 3 x 60 cents =$1.80 for the two of us. That was more than 10% of the food bill. I was told that's the rule of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a daily customer since they've opened as i live close by. Several things i've noticed throughout my visits... they finally got their LLBO (which is one of many things that i didn't like) and they fixed their A.C (eating there was uncomfortable cause of the heat). Food wise- good food for the price! Service Wise- definitely inconsistent. Overall, Good place to drop by for cheap food if you're on the run"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, but I can comment on the service, and it is egregious.  Last weekend, we came for dimsum.  Managed to catch a server at the hostess stand, and tell her the number in our party, and receive a number.  Good thing, because that was the LAST TIME someone showed up at the hostess stand.  Me and the rest of the people waited over an hour.  In that entire time, NOT A SINGLE TABLE WAS CALLED.  People were budding in line, and seating themselves at tables while they were being cleared, and no one was acting as the host or managing the situation.  So, no tables were called, because as far as the staff were concerned, tables were never free!  When multiple parties complained, the staff did nothing.  It was a terrible experience.  I can comment that the bathrooms were filthy.  I would avoid eating at a place as horribly managed and unclean as this."}
{"text":"To put it simply: 

- Air conditioning not working 
- Rude waitress 
- They didn't bring what we order on the paper sheet.  and charge us for things we didn't order. 
- I think that the worst and most disgusting was seeing cockroaches coming from inside the wall.

Overall if you are not Chinese and are planing to eat here, prepare yourself."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Crappy service - took an hour for 1st dish of a set meal to arrive.  Banquet dinner for 10+ with a $340 tab.  Insisted that we pay cash when we tried to pay by credit card, which we had to, and they tacked on a $30 credit card charge!  No written statement that we had to pay by cash but insisted that it was written in the menu (even though they admitted agreed it was vague).

Be prepared to pay cash and put up with poor service if you can overlook these for a decent meal."}
{"text":"A good variety of dishes, good service and relatively clean with friendly staff, would come again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute embarrassment to the Toronto restaurant scene. Recently went there on the weekend and it was bad once we stepped in. What restaurant do you know of that doesn't have air conditioning? It was actually hotter inside than it was outside of the restaurant.

When the food came, it was literally tossed onto the lazy susan and we were actually asked by servers to take the items from their serving trays while they rested the trays on the back of our seats. When one server spilled something on the bill as she placed it on the lazy susan, she took one of my family member's napkins, wiped the bill and just left the napkin. When we asked for another napkin, she just walked away without any acknowledgement. 

We then decided to cancel the remainder of our food order and we asked 10 times of different waiters and waitresses and still the food kept coming. It wasn't until we found a manager that the food stopped but by then we already got the majority of our order.

This place is an absolute disgrace and any self-respecting person who is interested in a comfortable and enjoyable meal should NEVER COME TO THIS RESTAURANT!!

The dishes may be cheap but there is absolutely no way in hell it's worth the aggravation to save a couple of bucks. 

This restaurant needs to run itself out of existence and the sooner the better. 

The funniest thing is that the front entrance has a huge picture of Stephen Harper with the chef. Clearly, either Stephen Harper has no taste or he is so used to being treated like $hit that it doesn't phase him anymore."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and also demanded gratuity on top of it! 
Food was mediocre. 
Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Went here for a dimsum a few times. I would say their dimsums taste pretty good. I'm not sure about their dishes though. 

It can get a bit loud, but not as loud as other dimsum places. You mostly order the dimsum that you want. There are one or two staffs walking around, offering other dishes, but they're not that intrusive."}
{"text":"Terrible environment. No windows. They don't open curtains. Terrible service. Never get the vinegar and dishes ordered. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"the best bang for your buck lunch menu are in Chinese writing. Bring a local friend. This place has been around for a while, with still relatively low prices compare to it's competitors. The best are it's starchcarb loaded dishes. There's lots of Wok taste (Canton food lover would know what I mean)"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the review here is so bad. This is a pretty typical Chinese restaurant where you shouldn't expect excellent service. The price is very reasonable. During my weekdays, each dim sum dish is only $2.00-2.38 from 8:30-4:00, that is really unbeatable. Food here is good, yummy but they don't have any specialty dishes that make them stand out from other Chinese restaurants. The only reason I took one star off is for the service, but otherwise it's a great place to come for a casual brunch."}
{"text":"This review is for their dim sum. It looks like they changed owners, but I know this restaurant has a long history of owner changes. The thing that stayed consistent was the tall skinny hostess who was always there to greet you. This visit I did not see the lady, the table clothes had changed, and the seat covers were now purple. Did I mention that I got rained on by a leaking ceiling? That too. Ha.

I was trying to figure out who the hostess was so I could get my number but no one came near the hostess podium. When one lady came there was a huge squarm of people who didn't get numbers yet just all yelling. People who were here after me had gotten numbers before me due to inattentiveness of the hostess. After giving away 9 numbers she then escaped again. It looks like she was busy cleaning tables and doing everything that seems like maybe tall skinny lady quit, too bad Cus I liked her :(

In order to get a table I had to like run over to a table she was cleaning and tell her I was next because she was too scared to go over to the podium to get bombarded. If she went over more often she wouldn't be bombarded every time. For all she cares I could have lied and just said it was my table. She didn't even bothered checking!

Soup dumplings had all the soup absorbed because they left them out from chef to table too long. Squid tentacles were good. Sui mai was all meat no shrimp. Congee with pork and preserved egg had really fatty meat ends which was kinda gross.

I don't know if I'll be back for a while, but I've been here like 15 times over my life time so maybe I'll be back again once the owners change again ha"}
{"text":"Very good dim sum that's better than some places I've tried in Hong Kong. The restaurant gets very crowded around 10:30am on weekends and holidays, but the servers are efficient and get people in fairly quickly.

The food is quite tasty, especially if you go often enough to know what they do well. The curry cuttlefish, shrimp dumplings, and various rice rolls are all consistently good. The fried dough is hit or miss, and so is the lobster special (available after 11am), but both are very good when done right. The food is reasonably priced, especially compared to dim sum places downtown.

The biggest negative about the place is the big picture of Stephen Harper in the main foyer."}
{"text":"This is the place for dimsum. I can't speak for a la carte orders but when you're looking for a cheap, quick, and delicious dim sum on a weekend...this is the place to go. It hits the spot. Keep in mind, it's always packed so try to make reservations if you are going for dim sum at prime time. However, if you're new to the dim sum scene, the service might turn you off...rather the lack of service. This is how it typically always is at dim sum."}
{"text":"The place was extremely  busy  but it was father  day we had a 7 lbs lobster which was excellent.  A little  salty. The place was warm but we had good service  . The price was high around 600 per table"}
{"text":"The main thing going for this restaurant are 1. Low Prices for mediocre (but still acceptable) dim sum and 2. Parking....usually available in the lot.   We thought the quality was a bit better when they first opened in late 2011.   Go here when you want value.   The place has gotten super busy lately....  They use carts on the week-ends and serve menu dim sum M-F."}
{"text":"My family comes here for dim sum from time to time. We had dinner here too. All in all it's not the best in terms of quality, but at these prices, it's hard to pass up. It's also the closest Chinese place to my house that maintains a high level of tradition. A lot of the congee places near Yonge/Finch just don't cut it for my parents. It's not my first choice (or even 10th choice) for a restaurant. I only come here because my parents insist on dragging me here. I have a good time anyways because I'm not that picky. Besides, getting Chinese food is typically a family occasion. So I can overlook a lot of the flaws. 

At a little over $2 for dim sum, it's a steal. If your'e really frugal and eat the filling stuff, 4 can dine for under $20. Yes that's how cheap it is. These prices attract tons of people. Even at 11 nearly all the tables will already have been taken. It's insane. If you don't want dim sum, you can order a dish of fried noodles which will range from $5.95 - $9. The dishes are meant for sharing like most Chinese dishes. They have some combos like lobster noodle + fried rice for $18. 

What about the quality? It's best described as edible. There must be a lot of MSG in the food because I'd often feel tired in the afternoon. I had their beef ribs once and it had a lot of fat. Another bad case was the tofu curd rolls (don't know English name). They put a big chunk of frigging taro in it. WTF? The sauce on the lobster was way too thick. Must be MSG I guess. Aside from these minor infractions, I think the food is generally passable. 

Don't expect attentive servers or English speakers in a Chinese restaurant. That's just a fact of life. This restaurant isn't suitable to foreigners imo. They will probably just leave feeling frustrated unless accompanied by Chinese. Most Chinese people don't care that much about service. They just want their food within reasonable time, at decent prices. They've screwed up a few times but it's not a big deal in my mind. The biggest screw up was with the fresh eel fried rice. They screwed up and brought us \"regular\" fried rice. We had to wait another 20 minutes for them to make the eel fried rice and it wasn't that good. Intentional attempt at scamming or a honest mistake? We forgive them either way. 

If you're frugal and not picky, this is THE dim sum place for you. If you're the type that cares a lot about the finer details of a restaurant, you're bound to be disappointed. Evidently this restaurant is always packed around lunch time so it must be doing something right. 

P.S., I F-ING hate the parking lot. Why do Chinese places always seem to have smaller lots? The worst part is that to maximize space, they made the driving lanes ONE WAYs. Whoever designed this parking lot should be shot. Bad drivers + narrow paths = disaster waiting to happen. Hasn't happened to me yet but it's bound to happen."}
{"text":"Come here for bang for your buck dim sum. Service as everyone said is quite bad. There was a really rude waiter that insisted we paid in cash because the total bill of our order wasn't very expensive. But there was also this other lady that didn't make it a problem and offered  us extra take out containers and plastic bag made up for it. Dim sum is your average, nothing stood out but nothing was bad either. Pork and preserved egg congee was BAD. They didn't used minced pork like how it should be in the traditional congees. Huge disappointment. I'd come here again during the weekend. Otherwise for more expensive price on the weekend I'd probably take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's official. After two times being treated unfairly, I am never returning under my own accord. Twice I made reservations, and twice I had to wait over 45 minutes beyond my reserved time. I even had the curtesy of arriving 15 minutes early knowing that Chinese restaurants have a behaviour over booking and then giving your table away to a friendly face; regardless if they have a reservation of not.

Twice I was left in a predicament where my annoying family endlessly harassed me for booking at the same establishment that doesn't honor the time of the reservation we booked. In hindsight, upon recalling my call to make one of the reservation and the other in person, in both circumstances they didn't care to note my name, and number. They just verbally confirmed the date and time back. Stupid would be me to fall for that the third time. 

Regardless of how decent their food is, I would not ever return as I don't like the fact they do not respect my time. Secondly, I wouldn't return for the reason that their air conditioning never seems to be sufficient in the hotter months. I'd much rather spend more of my money elsewhere, where they value the purpose of a reservation. I'd be totally happy to wait 1.5 hours if I really wanted to go there knowing fully well that there'll be a wait as they don't accept reservations. For them to accept reservations and to then have me wait is beyond rude.

From now on, my restaurants of choice will be on OpenTable, require a credit card for no shows, being on Bookenda, and those with the old school tradition of honoring a reservation. Short of that, I'll be the tardy family member showing up to a function late so that I don't have to wait, while others do the waiting for me!"}
{"text":"Landmark Seafood is a typical seafood restaurant of where you find classic Cantonese seafood dishes. They are well known for their dim sum and seafood choices, selections you would normally find if you were travelling to Hong Kong for. 

The interior design of the restuarant resembles a banquet hall you would expect to see when you are attedning a formal event or a wedding. 

In terms of the dim sum, it is very well priced compared to the typical market price of dim sum restaurants across Toronto. Each dish is prepared very well with care and quality with fresh ingredients. They have the classic dim sum dishes from spring rolls to siu mai to steamed rice rolls with shrimp. The prices are not too bad when it comes to the dinner hour. 

They are very well known in the Toronto community for their rising status as a seafood restaurant, as even the Prime Minister actually ate here during his Toronto visit.  

The service was average. First of all, my family had to wait 30 minutes just to be seated since the wait staff took forever to clean up a few tables when they were clearly empty for 15 minutes. The wait staff was very accomodating as they were very attentive to every request my family had, even though they were eager for us to leave when we were paying the bill.

Overall, Landmark Seafood is very nice restaurant to come if you are seeking classic seafood dishes you would find in the Cantonese regions in China."}
{"text":"Very different experiences when coming here for dim sum versus dinner.

Dim sum prices are great and cheap compared to other higher end Chinese \"fine dining\" dim sum restaurants. Portions are not that small as seen in a previous review. It is the order via menu paper type but they occasionally will have a waitress walk by with a cart of some dim sum dishes which I liked. Service is non-existent though because you just pick what you want and they deliver it. Quick, maybe a bit rude but efficient, and tasty enough for dimsum..

Very different for dinner. Came here for a celebration dinner for a friend's moms birthday (larger group) and all the dishes were too expensive for the quantity and quality received, especially the lobster. Think it was supposed to serve 10 people but barely enough meat pieces to go around for 5. Taste was alright.

Service for dinner was the turning to a 1 star point, they got some of the dishes wrong and insisted they were right. Then when my friend tried to pay using visa to treat for her moms bday, they said they only take cash. After making a big fuss on my friends moms bday, she had to drive to the nearest ATM and withdrawal a large sum of money. My friend told me she saw some sort of machine there behind the bar. In today's card society, cash only doesnt work well, especially when its hundreds of dollars.

The deco although not related to food is tacky and a bit outdated as well."}
{"text":"We arrived there and there were 5 of us.  We booked a table and waited.  We started noticing other groups behind us with 5 people were getting seated before us.  Then a group of 7 was seated at a 5 person table before us.  When we finally said something to the hostess they kept saying in Cantonese there's nothing we can do. It was clear we were getting upset but they continued to NOT do anything about it.  My sister started to raise her voice because our concerns about not getting a table were not being met.  They just kept turning a shoulder.  We had waited for an hour and fifteen minutes at this point.  Being frustrated, we just left to another restaurant.

My family will never be going there again. This is horrible service."}
{"text":"This review is entirely based on it as a dim sum restaurant. i go here for dim sum quite often, and thats mostly because this place's dim sum has always been pretty good, especially when compared to the price you pay. out of all the dim sum places in the area, i would say this one has a really good combination of price and quality. It is by no means the best dim sum you will ever taste. but it is above average, and won't cost you an arm and a leg. Most items they cook they do well. the one i especially love is their bbq pork puff, the puff they use is more western style puff pastry which i love, its taste is one of the better ones i've ever tasted. Outside of that this place offers a relatively good menu size, discounts before 11:00 and even after 11:00 it is still not too pricey of a joint. it gets super busy during the weekends and relatively busy most days due to a nearby retirement center. 

as the saying goes, if your dim sum place is full of older chinese seniors, you are in store for a good deal and good food. traditional old school.

I would recommend people in the area to go here, as it has been around for a very long time. the dim sum is worth the visit"}
{"text":"First of all, a caveat: if you are expecting Landmark Seafood to deliver you an exquisite Dim Sum experience with attention to detail and flawless service that knocks you right off your feet, you should lower your expectations. Do you expect a gourmet pheasant served under glass, and a massage while you eat when you step into McDonald's? 

What should you expect? If you're going during peak hours (AKA the weekend) you are going to wait. And wait. And wait some more. Don't like it? Get up earlier. On father's day we waited over an hour; par for the course. And to that same point, if it's busy they may lose some of your dishes on the way back from the kitchen. It happens! Deal with it.

Here's the trade off though: [1] the food is tasty, comparable to many downtown restaurants. I loved the cuttlefish and calamari, turnip cake and zhaliang, and I didn't find them any better or worse than Rosewood or Dim Sum King; but [2] the food is dirt cheap. Like, family of four eating under 30 dollars cheap. It is so affordable you will undoubtedly consider enduring the massive, lineups, weak service, uncomfortable seating, and egregious noise level. Provided you took my advice and lowered your expectations. I have a feeling all these one star reviewers thought they were dining at Canoe."}
{"text":"This restaurant is about a 30-minute drive from my house, yet my family and I have a habit of coming here at least once or twice a month! All our large family dinners (30+ people) and smaller dim sum outings (5 - 10 people) take place here because the staff is friendly, food is good, and price is okay.

Dim sum on weekends get exceptionally busy, but this is one of the few dim sum places that will accept reservations on weekends so call in advance. I recommend the sesame chicken that they bring around on carts. If you see it, GET IT! It's very hard to come across again!

I've been here countless times for large dinners with all my relatives for birthdays, holidays, etc (30-50 people, 10 courses, reserved tables of 12). Service is usually good - I can't remember having to ever wait too long for the next dinner course to arrive. The desserts are exceptionally tasty!

Staff is always friendly and try their best to speak English if you don't speak Cantonese. If my family doesn't come for 2 or 3 weeks, they always ask where we've been as if it's been years! There's even a TV in the main dining area and one time they were playing Twilight hahah. The parking lot is ONE WAY! Be careful because the spots are tight and it's always packed. Just drive to the back to be safe."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!! 

My brother insist to try this dim sum place dispute my poor experience in the past. Seems like they have not improve at all in two years. 

Service continues to be poor. Waiter continue to allow guest to bypass for the the line up system just because they know each other. There are 2 groups of guest by-passing  me this time. Food came faster this time. But looking for a waiter who will response to your request is impossible. We ordered rice rolls. It came in whole, we asked two separate waiters to cut it so we can share. One said we don't have scissor and walked away, the second one came back with a steak knife, she left it on the table, said nothing and walked away. We asked for chilly oil. A servicing lady came by with a whole tray of it on the cart, she refused to give us any. Again we have to ask 2 times before we get it, when the chilly oil finally came and it barely have enough to cover the bottom of the dish. During the bill time, my brother had enough and took the bill to the front to pay because we were tired of waiting. My brother gave them less then a dollar tip. The waitress instead of interested to know about our poor experience, she literally chase us out the front door demanding for more tip. The portion size of food is small, taste is average at best. Service is horrible. 


Dim sum is very average and super poor service from server. Line up is poorly organized, I came first and waited 3 other groups going in front of me with the same number of guest. Food takes too long to come and cold, server would not warm it up for me even with request. Bills takes forever to come. I'll never recommend or go to this place again."}
{"text":"Went here for a simple dinner with Dad and wife. The place is big enough to accommodate different group sizes. And no need for reservation for a small table of 3.

I saw a lot of bad reviews for this restaurant, I guess it really depends on your expectation. After all, it's a Cantonese Chinese Seafood restaurant, and yet they offer a wide variety of different dishes. Obviously, some dishes will be better made than others. For a three people meal on a budget, I ordered the following dishes.

Steamed Talipia - $18.95 (Score 5 out of 5)

This is the cheapest steamed whole fish you can get here. It's about 1.5 lbs in weight. It accompanies with a mix of cooked oil and soy sauce.

Deep fried sesame chicken - $10.95 (Score 5 out of 5)

If you're looking for something that goes well with a bowl of white rice, look no further than this dish. Large portion of deep friend chicken, coated with glazed sesame batter. Forget about the regular sweet and sour pork, this is a must have if you come to this place. I couldn't find it in any other Cantonese Chinese restaurant that makes this dish in perfection.

Green veggies with Shrimps and Scallops - $18.95 (Score 4 out of 5)

Had to look for a veggie dish to complete the meal. I figured if a dish of snow pea sprouts costs $17 (overpriced for the value that you're getting), why not add another $2 to get a substantial portion of shrimps and scallops. I'm not giving it a perfect score because I found it a bit greasy than I would like. Though this dish requires quite a bit of oil to create that shinny look for presentation."}
{"text":"Ain't bad...Putting aside the mediocre service (asked for an English menu since I don't read Chinese and they forgot - Their menus are in Chinese!), the food is pretty tasty and in good portions. We went for dinner. May try dim sum one day. - Updated: Reduced from a 4-star to a 3-star since they only accept cash.  In today's somewhat advanced society, there should be more options in terms of payment available for customers other than cash.  That is my honest opinion."}
{"text":"????????????????????victoria park?McNicoll??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d??????????"}
{"text":"I was on Sunday for  Dim Sum. I notice the portion is a lot  smaller than before.
Some of the female servers are quite rude. I think they are over worked and  under paid.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Service has downgraded, not that it was good to begin with. The staff are extremely pushy and rude, forcing you to order the dishes they're pushing around in carts and they've increased their dim sum prices. Even saw a staff member who was pushing a cart with food, put dirty plates and napkins beside. It's really hot and stuffy in here and they use fans to cool the place the down which doesn't do much. I really enjoyed this place but I guess I'll have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Mil got a free coupon for a sesame chicken dish. So we came here for dinner to try it out. Read the reviews on Yelp, so wasn't expecting a lot. Saw a lot of rotating fans, maybe their air con was not strong enough. Saw pictures of the chef with Mayor Scarpelli & Chef Yan. 

Decor is kind of tacky, golden chair covers & red table cloths. Golden Dragon & Phoenix on the wall near the stage. 

A Soup of the Day came to our table: Pork with Veggie

We ordered a 4 dish set meal: 
Ginger Juice Stir Fried Chinese Broccoli
Stir fried Snow Peas with Fish
Braised Tofu with Fish
Garlic Stir Fried Lobster
Free: Sesame Chicken (b/c of coupon)

My favourite was the lobster and braised tofu and fish.   Both were full flavour and was very tasty. The free sesame chicken was very tasty too and quite a big portion for a free dish. 

Finisher was a purple rice sweet soup. It was quite good as well. 

Overall, the service was ok, food was not bad either. 
I would come back again to try their dim sum etc."}
{"text":"My mom was craving dimsum yesterday morning so we came here to try this place.  There was only a couple of people ahead of us so we figured the wait would be ok.  We got a number but still waiting at least 30-40 minutes to be seated.  People kept coming in and seating themselves or they would talk to a server and get seated before the people in line with numbers.  The wait staff didn't really care that there are other people ahead of these rude people that have been waiting a lot longer.  

Once we were finally seated, it took forever to flag someone so we can give them our order.  When we finally got our food, we asked for hot sauce and never got it.  The food was salty and wasn't really good.  

The restroom was very dirty.  Let's just say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I live pretty close by to this restaurant and only really go here if it's a last resort kind of thing.  Anyway, I've been here a couple of times.  The service is very spotty / waiters are pretty inattentive.  The food could be better, but it's cheap dim sum, so what can you do?  That being said, even though it's cheap dim sum, the portions are smaller than other places that offer dim sum at the same price."}
{"text":"Standard dim sum dishes. Price is reasonable and it's offered all day so there is no need to rush for an early bird special. We had quite few dishes-the har gaw and siu mai are what you would expect from any dim sum restaurant"}
{"text":"Dim sum review, read my previous review for the dinner review. 

Order dim sum off a menu, they deliver on carts. Kinda slow delivering food, they also were swamped with a huge wait. We got here like 1030 am on a civic holiday and got a table around 1045. So 15 minute wait at 1030, i wonder how bad it is at noon. 

Service is more minimal at dim sum time. Still polite, just inattentive. Even the servers that deliver food were nice.

Tofu crepe. Deep fried japanese tofu, nice skin, smooth inside, with a bit of some chinse veggie. I liked it.
Deep fried Taro root dumplings, very nice crust and has the deep fried pork dumpling insides, very good.
Har gow, shrimp dumpling,  waited 45 minutes on this and cancelled our order for it... I am sad cuz i really wanted them too.
Siu mai pork dumpling, a mixture of pork and shrimp, as noted on ordering sheet. Good flavor and texture and density.
Beef balls. Good texture and flavor.
Shrimp crepe. good, nothing unique
Beef crepe. Very nice smooth texture and great flavor. The crepe is perfect thickness.
Fried dough crepe, typical, not oily and crispy."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their dim sum, which understandably can be hit or miss for people. It's between a 3.5-4 star for me, because I live close and come here often enough to know what dishes are hits. Also, service definitely varies between the servers here, some are very nice and friendly, while others are rude and/or careless. 
In terms of food, their rice noodles are almost always a hit, though the fried dough one can be hit or miss depending on the day. Other ones that have been consistently good are the shrimp and vegetable steamed dumplings, shrimp and tofu (labelled as steamed tofu stuffed with fish paste??? totally wrong translation), steamed cuttlefish is hit or miss but when it's a hit it's the best. 
Their prices are much cheaper than anywhere I've been downtown even though they recently raised their prices at the beginning of 2017 by adding the special \"SP\" size."}
{"text":"Came for Dinner, the place is not that full. We got the $238 meal (5ppl combo) that comes with Shark Fin Soup (had to pay extra $25 for extra bowl), 5lb lobster (cooked 2 ways) veggies and fish. 

The shark fin soup- they put bean sprouts in it which tasted weird, was disappointed.

5lb Lobster- doesn't look like they gave us 5lb. 

We complained and had to send back a veggie dish because it tasted so bitter! There wasn't enough sauce in the fish, tasted really bland. 

Overall, was a disappointing meal and not worth the price! Paid $350 (after tips) could've had a better meal at Fishman Lobste"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the GTA for Dim Sum, besides Rol San. Come early on weekends as i gets packed fast. I only come here for Dim Sum. Worth it."}
{"text":"Not much to say about the food. While it's not bad, it's not great either. The dim sum tastes alright but portions are smaller than the norm. Small details, like the rice noodles or the dough from the har gow breaking apart, would alert regular dim sum goers about the quality. But, the food is affordable. You win some and you lose some. 

Service, however, was horrendous (as many reviews have mentioned). Servers were rude and inefficient. Dim sum places, more often than not, charge for linens and tea. Here, if you are waived for tea, you get charged for linens. If you are not waived for the tea, well, you pay for it lol. For tea, beware: some selections are more expensive than others. As for the tablecloth fee: I've never heard of a dim sum restaurant that charges tablecloths per head... Usually it's just a $1 flat fee.

Conclusion: I'd rather spend a bit more and go somewhere else for dim sum."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum last Thursday around 11am for two. They have a good selection and everything is quite fresh. More expensive here than the Perfect Chinese restaurant but it's a nicer setting and better quality. Also there's always a long wait time there. We were seated immediately as it wasn't busy, then again it was a Thursday. My go-to items include shrimp dumplings, siu mai, seafood dumplings, beef tendon, chicken feet, fried red bean dumpling...etc. The fried taro with minced meat dish (forgot the name, it's also like a dumpling) is super yummy. It tastes a lot fresher than the other place I go to. However, the congee with preserved egg that we ordered was definitely not fresh. It tasted weird and off (was probably leftovers from another day). The fried dough we ordered also didn't rise so it was like inflated. But overall I would check out this place, dim sum here is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Came here got dinner with my family and firstly I would like to saw how bad their service was. We just sat down and the waitress was pushing for us to order the expensive seafood meal and some roasted bird. We told them we don't eat pigeon/bird, whatever it was and they became extremely rude. They ignored us when we told them we wanted them to remove the huge soup bowl because we were done with it and it was taking up space. We had to ask four times. Our meal was the lobster meal and it came with 5 preset dishes and we ordered two sides, one was clams and the other was mushroom and vegetables. 

Lobster was small and portion is shrunk.
Tofu and fish dish, we had 3 pieces of spoiled tofu.
Clams were mainly shells, we dug to the bottom expecting loose clams but there were none.
Mushroom and vegetable was literally 3 pieces of sliced mushroom and a huge pile of snow peas. With Occasional celery pieces  popping out. 
The chicken was fine and so was our eggplant and chicken dish. 

The whole meal cost about $135 and the waitress kept rushing us asking if we're done paying. We said not yet because we didn't get our dessert yet. They stalled out giving us our dessert until we finish paying and then they proceeded to count our money in front of us.

Definitely not coming back again. They don't even have the ac on and it is 28degrees today."}
{"text":"Dim sum was nothing special here, honestly I think it's a little bit below par compared to other places....we ordered their chow mein which was relatively cheap for $6 but it's drenched in sauce which made the noodles very soggy to a point where we could not eat it and had to return it....the manager was telling us that's how their chow mein is normally made but he was able to take it off our a bill with a little bit of attitude.....the thing that really surprised me about this place is that they charge $1.20 for table cloth, WTF?!?!? 

Not coming to this place again"}
{"text":"The first time I came to this place it was okay. Not very good. Just ok. It was a little rough. A little disorganized. I hear you.... \"It is a Chinese dim sum place, John.  That is part of the charm\".  Well yes, however this one was beyond charm. 

Now having come back a handful of times, this last visit was great. The quality of the food has increased by multiples. It is cleaner and way more organized. Now I feel like I can comfortably recommend. Next time I will take some pictures of the food."}
{"text":"BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!! I went with my supper club for a late lunch just before Christmas which consists of 6 people. We ordered 23 dishes (14 @ $2.18 & 9 @ $2.38) off the menu for a total of $66!! The food was super satisfying and the dim sum was as good as going to China Town in Downtown Toronto. Don't expect much with decor, it is what you would expect from a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Super authentic. Filled with families, as many as 4 generations at the same table. The decor is just what you would expect, over elegant in all the best ways. All the food was amazing, even during a busy Sunday rush:)"}
{"text":"Average food, nothing outstanding. You can pretty much get the same quality food at Perfect Chinese Restaurant for cheaper. Restaurant has nice interior but was not well-heated. I was freezing sitting at the back of the restaurant. No credit card option, just cash."}
{"text":"Landmark Seafood Cuisine is the new Chinese restaurant that opened at the  location that used to be Elegantview Chinese Restaurant http://www.yelp.ca/biz/elegantview-chinese-restaurant-scarborough.

Not much has change in terms of the decoration... and still offers decent priced dim sum.

Daily Dim Sum from 8 AM to 4 pm
Weekday All Day S/M/L $1.98 and XL $2.18
Weekend All Day S/M/L $2.18 and XL $2.38
Tea is 60 cents per person

The menu curiously has most of the popular dim sum items priced as XL but at $2.18, I am not complaining as the food quality is decent.

We ordered:
- Seafood Dumpling in Soup XL
- Har Gow XL
- Siu Mai XL
- Steamed Seafood Dumplings with Baby Vegetables XL
- Chicken Feet M
- Steamed Shrimp Rice Roll XL
- Deep Fried Taro Dumplings L

In an half empty restaurant, we were seated at the worse table one can imagine facing the storage just because it is close to the front counter. Service was the usual unattentive as we were there close to 2:30 pm and the wait staffs have more urgent things to take care of than serving us.

I would come back here for dim sum as the price is right and the place is not too busy for late afternoon dim sum!"}
{"text":"This place has decent good but the service is appalling and somehow getting worse. We asked for drinks/napkins/rice, etc multiple times throughout our meal and it seems like every waitress was trying to avoid eye contact for dear life or would tell us 'hold on' and then walk away. Ridiculous. Not only that but they are rude and deceptive. We ordered one of the combo dinners for a dozen people and of course they didn't have the right size lobster or something so we needed to pay an extra $15 an extra smaller lobster. They're ripoff artists not waiters."}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL, I would go back to try their dim sum as I viewed their menu and thought it was probably worth testing. Also, it's relatively cheaper than most places as it's around $2.18 - $2.38 a dish.

I came here for an early dinner with a table of 10 people. We ordered a set menu at around $168, which included:
- 5 pound lobster (house special, looked really nice and appealing, but it wasn't fully cooked, and really salty);
- snow pea with dried fish flakes on top (kind of tough, but the sauce was alright)
- some egg thing (really salty, not worth);
- sea bass fish (it was made really nicely, the fish was literally \"standing up\" - well swimming style, it also came with it's own soy sauce cup for us to pour);
- sweet and sour eel (first they made the wrong style of eel that we picked so that delayed our chances of trying it)
- vancouver crab (I think it was baked, it was made in a really unique style but... it wasn't that good)
--- I don't quite remember of that was all but... we also ordered items on top of that set menu:
- seafood fried rice (really plain and salty)
- fried rice noodle with peppers (REALLY salty)
- seafood chow mien (needless to say... REALLY SALTY!)
- sweet and sour chicken (this dish was actually one of the better tasting dishes we had in this meal, and it was literally sliced chicken breast... BUT, there wasn't a lot of chicken to that dish, and since it was sliced the chicken breast was really dry!)

If you are a person who doesn't enjoy salty dishes (like myself), please do not attempt to try this place out. On top of our order, we asked for \"less salt and oil,\" obviously, from my review, you will see that... that has not been done! 

- oh last note, they were really eager and impatient for us to pay the bill and stood there eyeing us counting the cash for a good while till we gave them the bill...

Anyways, apart from all the salt and impatient servicing, needless to say that there are far better places to try in Markham/Scarborough. But, like I said in the beginning... I still want to give their dim sum a go :)"}
