{"text":"We recently moved to the area and decided to try one of the pizza places near us. We ordered our pizza, picked it up, drove 10 minutes back to our house and when we opened the box the pizza was cold. Pizza is my favorite food and I have eaten many pizzas but I could not eat this one. The tomato sauce tasted like canned sauce and the toppings/cheese weren't fresh. I couldn't finish even one slice of pizza because it was inedible. This is the first time we've ever thrown away pizza in our house."}
{"text":"We love Figaro's Pizza! My kids get their personal pizza and I like their chicken sandwiches especially the Milano!So nice to have them in Phoenix as well!"}
{"text":"We get pizza from here about twice a month and love it.  The franchise owner works there most days and ensures quality.  Sometimes he makes deliveries."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my 91-year-old grandmother, who said she was craving pizza. I was looking up the address to Figaro's in Golden Hill, since we really enjoyed it on my last visit, and came across this new one even closer to her house. We drove over 30 minutes before closing to grab a take & bake and the young guys behind the counter were very pleasant and efficient. The pizza was, as usual, delicious!"}
{"text":"Figaro's Pizza is fast and tasty. I have always had a good experience with the manager/owner. He is friendly and appreciative toward his customers. I always pick up my pizza, and it is hot and fresh. I prefer the regular crust to the deep dish. I feel that it is a great value for the money. I like supporting this business, because the ingredients taste fresh, not frozen, like some chains. They are very generous with their toppings. I would recommend this for a quick and easy dinner."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing. I'm so glad to have them in Phoenix.  It is so much tastier and fresher than any other pizza establishments, plus the store is super clean and open so I can actually watch then cook my pizza from start to finish. Figaro's ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. The garden salad was very basic and wilted. The cheesy bread sticks were soggy and the sauce on the pizza was bland. Disappointed :(."}
{"text":"Take-out or delivery only. Fantastic pizza and genuine customer service. Good specials. Fast service. Closes at 9pm M-Th, 10pm Fri & Sat. Lots more than just pizza. Also has take and bake pizza pies."}
{"text":"Ordered a XL chicken, bacon, artichoke with parm. sauce pizza, Friday online on my Iphone. I will say ordering that way is pretty tedious and next time Ill just call in my order. But, my pizza was ready in 30 min, in fact it was being sliced as I walked in to get it. Smelled and looked great. People at the counter were friendly and the place seemed pretty clean. Got home and grabbed a piece. It was really good, nice amount of toppings and fresh cheese with a good combo of flavors. Crust was good, but I think it made need to be cooked a few minutes longer for my tastes. I also like that they are right on Main St for its so CONVENIENT to stop off on the way home to grab your dinner.Ill be back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Figaro's Pizza!  They are SO nice and accommodating and their food is fabulous and pricing is extremely reasonable!"}
{"text":"Nope. The have delivered three times and I tipped well.  The last few times they said I was too far out of the area to deliver too.  Be consistent."}
{"text":"Can not go wrong!   We went there after a long hard day working on the Land with the entire crew!   There was a mix up with the order, no fear they fixed it without a blink of a eye!   They were horribly busy that Friday, and still took care of our entire party with no hassle or complaints. GREAT Customer Service and AWESOME FOOD! AMAZING People in a small town, super clean, super nice and friendly!  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service! Must try the 12 topping classic, it is very filling and delicious. Glad to have one in Phoenix, and having delivery available is nice as well. Glad to have more than 1 pizza option for sure."}
{"text":"I give all restaurants the benefit of a doubt. This is the last straw the salad mix was so wilted and nasty I couldn't eat it. It smelled unwashed and old. The pizza was chewy and unflavored. I made a terrible choice tonight. It won't happen again this was the second time. I thought it was a one off but not. Even the salad dressing was sour. I hope nobody gets sick eating there."}
{"text":"Figaros is great! We no longer order from the big chains because Figaros is not only delicious, but they are super friendly and quick. When they arrive, they are like old friends. We love their crust, cheese, and toppings. Their extra large specialty meat pizza is our favorite. If you're in the Indian Land/Fort Mill area, you have to give Figaros a call. They always have specials and coupons, so look those up as well."}
{"text":"Solid delivery pizza in Indian Land. The owner is very nice and let's you know about the deals he's running so you can save a few bucks. This place is worth your time and money - certainly the best delivery pizza in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. We get the garlic chicken a lot, great for something different! Love the place and the people, always very friendly. Pizza is always delivered hot and yummy!"}
