{"text":"Its goes to show, the previous people gave a glowing review , perhaps we were unlucky, but ours was dreadful. In every way. The food served was poor quality, chips cold, service slow, and waiter very unpleasant. 
We eat out quite a lot, with many good experiences in Scarborough, but this one ranks probably the worst , not only in Scarborough but anywhere. 
Dreadful"}
{"text":"My partner, daughter and I decided to try somewhere new for lunch the last time we visited Scarborough. Restaurant 55 is on the Main street leading up to town from the seafront.


 We didn't know what to expect when we went in, as it looked a bit drab - but when my other half is hungry he needs feeding and the waiter that greeted us showed us to a table next to the window with lovely views of the seafront.


 It didn't take us long to decide what we wanted, fish and chips for him, half a chicken for me and an extra plate as daughter usually shares with us.


 We waited quite a while for our food, but it was worth the wait as it was exceptional! The chicken was moist and flavorsome, and the chips, cooked in their skins and seasoned with herbs and what looked like sea salt were devine! The fish my partner assured me between mouth fulls was wonderful also! and the waiter was more than happy to provide the extra plate for my daughter and there was more than enough food for all three of us!


 We were really pleased and surprised at finding Restaurant 55, the prices were reasonable, the view gorgeous and more importantly the food.. YUMMY"}
{"text":"Customer service was good, not exceptional. 

2 Vegetarian Options surprised me (as its a seafood restaurant), so I was pleased by this.

I ordered Roast Veg & Mozzarella Crouton. It was tasty, but the Mozzarella was overpowering, and drowned out the taste of the vegetables. There wasn't a varied range of vegetable, just beansprouts, sweetcorn & green beans with lettuce underneath the crouton. 

My Dad ordered fish and chips, and said that the batter was way too fatty and greasy, and the chips were very under cooked.

My sister has Goat's Cheese and said is was very nice. 

We ordered 2 milkshakes but were not able to get them as they had run out of milk, so this was very disappointing for me and my sister."}
{"text":"We have just come back from Scarborough. We were very disappointed because on the Wednesday we went to restaurant 55 just after 7pm to be told that you close at 7pm, fair enough. So the next night we came back early from walking on the moors especially to go to restaurant 55 for a meal. Got to your restaurant about 6pm to be told that they were closing early. We could have spent longer in the moors if we'd have known. This is not good customer service!!!"}
