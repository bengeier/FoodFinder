{"text":"Not good at all. Noodles clump together and taste like spaghetti. Better to stay home and boil store bought pasta."}
{"text":"Good food good service! I like there chicken very much, very crunchy! And the Staffs are so nice, very good service!"}
{"text":"A very great restaurant a good place to eat ramen, the pork chashu taste good and the soup is good, there are many selections of side dishes.  And I think I'd like to come back again as a customer and a ramen lover."}
{"text":"Miso Pork Ramen was okay, underwhelming miso flavour made a bland broth. Had to add in a side of chilli oil - this place doesn't offer custom spice levels like other Ramen places; all prefixed selections. That being said, the chilli oil wasn't spicy at all but definitely made the ramen a tad more flavourful. Price is average, decor was nice and clean. A cute spot for students to hang out but wouldn't return for the ramen."}
{"text":"Spicy seafood noodle is really good. Recommend people who like spicy and seafood to try. Environment and service is good. Very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Bad service, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ramen. I'm saying this as a person who love ramen and have gone to a lot of ramen places. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, especially all the different Ramen on the menu. Also a nice place to people watch in the summer on their colorful terrace."}
{"text":"My first meal in Montreal and we were starving so we didn't have time to YELP so we ended up here.

So the noodle it is customization, you check off on a small paper menu on everything you want to order. If you are getting noodles you can pick the soup base, the protein, noodle texture. There are also other appetizers on the menu. Everything is very clear and the price adds up according to what you add onto your noodles!

The soup base of the noodle was very BLAND. The pork bone flavor is slightly better than the miso flavor. It was a big disappointment. We paid almost $18CAD(extra protein and noodles) for a bowl of noodle and it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken curry, got a tripe soup.  Broth was bland, tofu had a weird taste, I rarely say this but I will never come back."}
{"text":"One of the worst ramen I've had in a long time. The broth was so bland, it was almost just hot water. The fish tofu inside tasted like a wet block of salt. The egg was okay, nothing too fancy. For the price of 12.99 it feels like a ripoff. We spent most of the time thinking how we could've been eating ramen at Misoya for the same price. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Location: Their location is perfect, about 1 min walk from Guy-Concordia station. 
Environment: A perfect to go place in the rainy days. The deco is not fancy, but the cozy kind. A place you want to sit in for the whole afternoon and achieve nothing, hahaha.
Food: The fried chicken curry is recommended in the \"normal food\" category. The chicken nuggets is crunchy, and the sauce goes with it is just amazing. The chicken fillet ramen is my no. 1 \"soothing food\". 
Price: The price there is around $10. Affordable choice as work day lunch.
What I love the most about this place is that they take the customers suggestions seriously. The servers and the owner are always talkable."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. Their ramens are so good. I love the one with noodles and braised beef the most. The okonomiyaki over there is super delicious also. Suggest you guys should go there ans taste the food, you won't regret."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has only 3 stars:  it's very clean, service good, staff super polite, nice deco , good terrace , super affordable price and food is very good overall.  You cannot ask more if you are looking for a good bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"I actually had a very good experience today. The server was one of the nicest I've had in Montreal, they have outdoor seating which was cute because the weather permitted it, and they had a MyPiece deal for the chicken fillet curry, which was so tasty! They even give you a free egg roll while you wait for your food. $10 including taxes for this meal was a great deal, specially if like me, you work in the area and are trying to not eat the same thing everyday. Would go back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"La déco est pas mal. Bouffe plus que moyen moins, et 50% trop cher. Viande de mauvaise qualité, nouilles trop cuites, oeufs encore froids et manque de saveurs."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a small little restaurant near Concordia. It's clean and quiet. Nice little spot for lunch or dinner.

FOOD: Food was satisfactory. Overall, the portions are small but the flavors are well done. I had the beef with rice. The little hints of ginger that they give you is a nice touch. The ramen was good as well, although a little bit bland. You can choose what you want on little slips of paper and customize your soup. 

PRICE: Prices are decent. I think you can get better portions with the price we paid but it was still affordable.

SERVICE: The staff were very nice. They even let us stay in the restaurant for an hour or two to study (although this was during the quiet hours). I really like the workers here."}
{"text":"Quality , service and portions were sastifactory, nice decoration, quiet environement, prices are standard. Litlte terrasse."}
