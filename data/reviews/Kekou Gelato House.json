{"text":"This place has really interesting flavours totally different from your typical gelato place which is a nice change.  There was a huge line when we arrived but it moved quickly and we were happy we waited. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"All the flavors are great, the durian is a personal favorite. Also very close to campus which is a plus."}
{"text":"Love this place, Its a pure pleasure to sit outside in the summer ... Love the Black Sesame"}
{"text":"Incredibly unique flavours! I had Viet coffee and whiskey green tea; sampled Tsingtao peach and durian. All were very true to their names ;) Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Rating it 4 stars for the variety of flavors. The only place I know that makes such interesting flavors as Vietnamese coffee, salted plum, HK milk tea, etc.  Quality of gelato is OK but not stellar.  These guys have weird hours that keep changing with the season so best to call before you go to ensure they are open.  Great place to go if you're in the Baldwin area."}
{"text":"With the perfect summer week, I am on a quest for the perfect ice cream treat. Kekou Gelato filled that void. I ordered the Small, it was smaller than anticipated, but it satisfied my craving for ice cream and not filling me up as I was on my way to dinner. I ordered the Black Sesame, it had the nutty sesame flavour I was anticipating with a cool refresshing iced gelato. Would definitely go back for my next ice cream craving."}
{"text":"My favourite gelato place so far!!!  I went for the first time and the staff was super friendly!! They let me and my friend try multiple flavours!! I liked all of the ones I've tried and felt bad for trying more but they kept suggesting new flavours to me and I couldn't resist.   I tried durian (tastes like durian), hk milk tea (also tastes like it), black sesame, peanut sesame, oolong tea (has a strong flavor). They were all so so good that it was super hard to decide!!   I ended up ordering peanut sesame and oolong tea, and I will definitely be back to have the hk milk tea and I really want to try Viet coffee."}
{"text":"Disappointing. This place has recently changed their serving sizes to half of what was previously offered, yet kept the price the same.  As a long time customer and fan of Kekou I have to say it's thoroughly disappointing. Meh !"}
{"text":"They're open again for the summer, very tasty gelato at great prices. The servers were very patient with me as I sampled several flavors-- they're all asian-inspired, no easy western fallback if you're not used to these flavors. :) I went for the Tsingtao Peach and HK Milk Tea, which were super tasty."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Saturday afternoon to grab some gelato. I have heard a lot about this place from friends but haven't had a chance to try it until today.   It wasn't too busy so we didn't have to wait long (the small line up moved very quickly). The staff is very friendly and accommodating as they let you try whatever flavour you like.  We picked Vietnamese coffee, HK Milk tea, oolong milk tea and black sesame.  We absolutely loved all flavours but my utmost favourite would be the Vietnamese coffee which really captured and imitated the real coffee taste.   This was my first time but definitely will not be my last at KEKOU."}
{"text":"It was good, service was great. They allowed us to sample which wasn't that bad. Tried mango and pineapple which I couldn't complain. Will try their green bean whisky next time tho."}
{"text":"Lots of interesting flavours.  I love their viet coffee , mango and sesame.  They also come out with new flavours every week so it's always exciting to go."}
{"text":"falling in love immediately with this place just first time came here. I love everything about this place! unique ice-cream flavours, my best best is spicy salted pineapple, extremely friendly lovely staff, simple space but casually, relaxing atmosphere. It seems the ice cream flavours are seasonal, but still a variety of choices: vietnamese coffee, oolong tea, whiskey green tea, rice wine, black sesame, sour op, durian, ect. Add a little bit more for a fresh made cone would never be disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love this place! I'm really happy that I found this little gelato place tucked in near the corner of Baldwin St and McCaul (as it is close to my school :D)  The flavour of gelato they have always change depending on the ingredients they have in stock for the moment. The favourite part about this place is that the flavours they have are absolutely unique and delicious, not your typical gelato flavours.  The staff and service there are always welcoming and nice :)   Definitely a must go if you're around the area! :D"}
{"text":"Unique flavours galore! Of course they are subject to personal opinions but I like most of the flavours I tried so far. My favourites are coconut green bean, osmanthus plum berry (which closely resembles the taste of one of my favourite summer drinks), and oolong milk tea. It is also worth noting that their mango flavour is quite unique - think of sweet dried mango in gelato form!"}
{"text":"Love the unique and subtle flavours. Not overrated - check it out. I am also not a big ice cream person so this perfect."}
{"text":"Very strong and true flavour, taste like the real thing. We ordered durian, green tea whiskey and pineapple. It was not expensive, expect line ups in this place but we went near closing on a rainy day we got lucky. Will be back to try other flavours. Note this place is slightly towards asian flavours and slightly adventurous, don't expect to find regular normal ice cream flavours you would find in a mall."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!  We've sampled many of their flavours...and they were all great - some weird but very flavourful. They will let you sample before you commit. Of course, their offerings change regularly so we'll have to keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of Toronto being a fusion of different cultures.  The owners are Asians who love gelato so much, they went to Italy to learn the craft properly, bought the big machine, and experimented infusing the gelato with Asian flavours.  What are \"Asian flavours\", you may ask?  Black sesame, jasmine green tea, roasted oolong milk tea, spicy mango, green bean coconut, red bean white chocolate, Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, rice wine milk, tsing tao peach, etc....and of course, the love/hate it, durian.  If you don't know what durian is, you will definitely be able to identify the smell upon entering the store (spoiler alert: it smells like fart).  If you are adventurous and can withstand the durian smell long enough to sample flavours and place your order, you have the makings of becoming a return customer.  A small cup is about $4 and you get to choose two flavours.  You can try samples of whichever flavours you want before deciding what to buy.  There are benches outside for you to eat your treat before you head off.  The gelato melts quickly because they don't use stabilizers so you should eat it on the spot if you can.  Kekou closes from November to April every year for winter, so the summer months are the only time you can gorge yourself on this deliciousness."}
{"text":"Full out 5 stars.. I don't like gelato.. but this place blew me away. The black sesame is a MUST try!!! This place is perfect after a bowl of ramen from Kinton 4 doors down."}
{"text":"One of the best ice cream place. Variety of ice cream flavor.   My favorite is the milk tea flavor and the oolong flavor one. The milk tea flavor is a very close depiction of the milk tea I had in Hong Kong, really recommend trying.  There are many more great taste to explore in that place."}
{"text":"If you're looking to try something new, you should definitely come here. The flavours are unique and delicious. So far I have tried the peanut sesame and black sesame flavours. For a size small, I feel like the portions are quite large thus making it worth it's money. The servers are quite friendly and won't judge you even if you sample all the flavours! I will definitely come back again to try out some more unique flavours."}
{"text":"This is an amazing gelato place. There are so many Asian flavours from Durian to Black Sesame, which is so different from the usual gelato parlour. It was my first time here and the ladies that were working there were very helpful and patient (lol, it was so hard to choose which flavours to get!). You can try any flavours that you want, so don't be afraid to ask for some samples.   I ended up getting mango and durian, which were so delicious! I got a medium cup, which had 2 scoops, and it was $5 after tax. Considering the quality of the gelato, it was definitely worth it. My boyfriend got the Viet coffee, whiskey green tea, and rum condensed milk. His absolute favourite was the whiskey green tea!   Their other location is at Queen St and Spadina and they apparently have soft-serve there. We'll definitely be checking out that location next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Asian-inspired gelato flavours and so many different flavours to choose from!  Durian is one of their top sellers, but for me it's sadly my kryptonite.  My favourite is the Soursop!  Just be sure to ask for a sample before diving in and making that final choice as there is a lot to choose from.  The service and staff are great as the place can get packed.    The only reason I gave it a 4 was the fact that the price to portion ratio could be a little bit better."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of gelato but this place truly has delicious flavours! I got the whiskey green tea and Hong Kong milk tea flavours in a small cup. It was just the right amount and the flavours were on point. My friend got the Hong Kong milk tea and viet coffee flavours and loved them as well. Last but not least, the service was great, they let us try out as many flavours as we wanted. Highly recommend kekou!"}
{"text":"They are super nice here and have the most unique Gelato flavors that I have tried. I definitely recommend this place. Great customer service! I would recommend trying the Red bean white chocolate,  the soursoup and the avocados banana."}
{"text":"Customer service is extremely important to me, and this place has it down to the T! The girls that were working when I came in were so helpful! Despite the crowds, they let my friend and I try the flavours we wanted, recommended some popular ones, and were sooooo patient with us!   I ended up getting black sesame and green bean coconut, both surprisingly good! My friend got Vietnamese coffee and avocado banana. She enjoyed hers too.  Lots of interesting flavours here! I'll definitely be back to try more.   Note: the only downside is that the inside of this little gelato shop can seat a total of 4 or 5 people. Lots of cute benches outside though!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing. Gelato in Asian flavours like Vietnamese coffee, durian, ginger, sesame, etc. should be in every gelato place. Anyway, this tiny shop (which is currently closed during the winter season) is quality and such a treat. I always get the Viet coffee gelato, which is deliciously strong and sweet just like the real deal, and the strawberry-lychee sorbet, which is a genius flavour combo in itself and well blended so that one fruit does not overpower the other. You can sample any and all the flavours beforehand and there are some seriously interesting ones (chocolate-wasabi?)which show some real thought behind the making of each gelato. One downside: they make small batches and some flavours aren't always in season so they may not always have the flavour you want, but that's also a great excuse to try something new!"}
{"text":"LOVE THE GELATO HERE! Great selection of exotic, unusual flavours. Because they place great emphasis on freshness, you will get seasonal flavours. When my friend and I went, we sampled:  - black sesame - spicy mango - peanut sesame - durian  We were very satisfied with all the flavours but we particularly loved the black sesame. Flavour and nuttiness were spot on - significantly better than the tubs you'd find in asian supermarkets. The texture was very creamy and I appreciate that the sweetness is not overpowering. With a picky and sensitive palette, I tend to find many ice cream/gelato parlours offer sickeningly sweet flavours. However, this was not the case at Kekou.   I'd definitely return for the wonderful flavour surprises. Highly recommend for adventurous dessert fans!"}
{"text":"In this age of me too Gelato places, it is refreshing to see a different take on the Italian dessert.  The flavours are actually unique and not the typical vanilla and stracciatella.  Not that there is anything wrong with the tried and true.  It's just nice to see someone offering something different in the city.    Location is good on Baldwin, with other neighboring restaurants close by.  Benches outside are nice for the patrons.  Inside is decorated nicely with a view of the person actually making the gelato so we know it's not sourced somewhere else like other places.    Tried a few flavours, Jasmine tea (too strong), ginger milk (spicy!), yogourt (very nice), banana avocado (more banana than avocado).  If anything the flavours are a bit strong but some people may prefer that.  Will try other flavours on other visits.  Quantity and quality are very good for the dollar.  If you're in the area, worth a visit."}
{"text":"Durian gelato makes me feel so close to Asia . :) The combination of whiskey green tea and durian is awesome as well."}
{"text":"We tried the durian (yes, DURIAN) and hong kong milk tea gelato, and both were awesome! It's not too sweet and has a nice balance of everything.   Would definitely come back to try other flavours."}
{"text":"Durian flavor is a MUST for those who come from ASEAN countries, but the taste of it isn't always consistent. (I am very sensitive and picky on the durian flavor) Also, other flavors are recommended as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  My new favourite gelato place :)  I sampled half the menu and found all of the flavours were well balanced and delicious.  I went with green bean coconut and strawberry lychee, and my partner got Hong Kong milk tea and guava plum salt.  We were both very happy.  The gelatos are creamy and have the texture of the ice cream my family used to make at home when I was a kid, and the sorbets are wonderfully refreshing.  If I lived in this area, I would be here constantly."}
{"text":"Kekou Gelato is definitely not your usual gelato place.  They have Asian inspired flavours that you would not find anywhere else like durian, rice wine milk or roasted oolong tea.  The great thing about this place is that they will let you try as many flavours as you might like so if there is a flavour you are not familiar with and would not dare to go for the full size you can try it out first.  Which is what I did with durian, a flavour I have never tasted before and heard about how unusual and pungent it can be.  It tasted pretty okay but I guess it is an acquired taste because I would not order it.  It did not taste bad but it definitely had a flavour you either love or do not care for.  So for me it was the latter.   My favorites so far have been whiskey green tea, Vietnamese coffee and Tsing Tao Peach.   The whiskey green tea is so flavourful and you can definitely taste both distinctive flavours.  The staff even warn you that the gelato contains real whiskey - which is absolutely fine by me.  It gave me a nice warm feeling in the belly followed by an awesome green tea aftertaste.  The flavour combination really worked for me.  My other favorite flavour is the Vietnamese coffee.  Is it ever delicious?!?  The coffee flavour really comes through and for a coffee lover it's an amazing treat.  Who needs coffee when you can have coffee gelato!!!  The Tsing Tao Peach also has a great, slightly sweet and delightfully peachy flavour.  It is especially very refreshing on a hot summer day.   Kekou Gelato is really worth checking out especially if you are more adventurous and are looking for more unique gelato flavours.  This place stands out of the crowd and it is located in the quaint area of Baldwin street where you can go for a stroll and enjoy the beautiful summer weather.  Bonus: they also have a loyalty card that you can get stamped for every gelato you buy so you can rack up your stamps and get a free scoop."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love!  Their ice cream are the best in town. Must visit and try all different flavours. My favourite are thai ice tea, durian and coffee flavours."}
{"text":"I don't even eat Gelato that much but this place makes me crave for it.. You gotta try black sesame, yogourt, coffee flavour.. yum yum. Sad that I must wait until Spring again."}
{"text":"This little store was a pleasant surprise on Balwin Street. In an small inconspicuous villa, all the flavours are written outside on a blackboard. I was very surprise that they offered Asian flavours such as Black Sesame, Vietnamese Coffee and even Hong Kong Milk tea. All of them taste that are made from the original ingredients and I was too greedy and tried 4 flavours in one day. I would strongly recommend this place after a nice dinner in the Baldwin Village."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato with very interesting and exotic flavors hardly served by other gelato places in town. The mix of Durian Pistachio and fumed jasmine green tea was a true delight .  In addition, the hot version of the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk is another very good enjoyable treat."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kekou since it first opened. They give you a lot of gelato for your $ and I've yet to find a flavour there I dislike. They're also really good with letting you sample flavours.   My only wish is that they'd open earlier in the year. Passed by in May and was surprised they hadn't opened for the season yet."}
{"text":"The concept of Asian Gelato sparked me to wanting to try this place. Not because I'm asian....well maybe yes that is a factor. I love gelato and adding an asian flair to it, I had to check it out. I coerced my friends to come with me after we had Ramen and they were glad I brought them!  As soon as you walk up, the many flavours are written on a chalkboard before you enter into the store. The staff were extremely attentive, nice and patient. You are able to try out all the flavours as you please before making your final decision.  The sizes come in Small (2 flavours), Medium (3 flavours) and Large (take away container).  Flavours include: Durian, Jackfruit, Jasmine Tea, Lemon Chrysanthemum, Red Bean White Chocolate, Spicy Mango, Soursop, Strawberry Lychee  and Vietnamese Coffee (these were the ones that stuck out).  Would I go back? Of course! Definitely a great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Interesting flavour selection! Including thai ice tea, Viet coffee, mango, spicy mango, and more! Definitely a cozy little place! Not much sitting room inside."}
{"text":"Had the red bean and chocolate and rosemary pistachio. Amazing. Loved them. If you want to try new ice cream flavours, it's the place to go."}
{"text":"my favorite gelato place!  we've ordered cups and pints since it opened.  our most favorite flavors are:  Vietnamese Coffee and Avocado Banana.  but we also love strawberry-lychee, spicy mango with plum powder and coconut-sticky rice topped with chopped peanuts.  soursop is also refreshing.  Soma Chocolatier has tried making gelatos with tropical flavors but they don't get it right.  Kekou does.  each bite/lick is flavorful.  some gelatos are cloying and you get sick of them after a few spoonfuls (take that, Momofuku Milk Bar) but not here."}
{"text":"Always my go to place for gelato. The Baldwin location is usually my favourite one, it cozy, had a nice seating area outside and usually awesome staff. Unfortunately, I'm not always in the area. So every time I am, it's always a nice treat.  Love the asian inspired flavors - had Vietnamese Coffee and Black Sesame - Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"3 to 4 visits later and I'm still loving this place. One thing I've found is that I tended to prefer their milky/creamy gelatos to their fruity selections. Other selections that I've really liked are the peanut sesame, green bean coconut, HK milk tea and Viet coffee."}
{"text":"This gelato place is amazing and I always want to come here whenever I go downtown. They have so many Asian inspired flavours and I don't have anything to complain about it. I've been here numerous occasions and recommend it to all of my friends.  I've tried many flavours such as Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, whiskey green tea, black sesame, green bean coconut etc... I wish I lived closer so I could go more often because this cute little shop is a must during any trip downtown.  They allow customers to sample their flavours and the team members are quite friendly and helpful. It can get a bit busy at times but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"omg this place is so good!  you must try the \"soursop\" and \"vietnamese coffee\" flavours! The next runner ups were thai milk tea."}
{"text":"Very creative gelato flavours that are made excellently - perfect texture and temperature for gelato and the flavours are not too overpowering, yet shine through deliciously!"}
{"text":"So yummy!! And so many flavours to chose from, there's always quite a lot of people waiting a line but totally worth it. Nice seating outside too"}
{"text":"While in the hip, eclectic Kensington Marketplace area, my nephew urged me to try the \"Gelato House\" as they are unique  and are unlike other gelato shops that have the traditional gelato flavors. Not being a gelato fan in general but wanting to step out of my comfort zone, I ordered the whisky green tea gelato and upon my first taste, my taste buds came to attention. This Asian style gelato was truly unique and definitely was a \"wow\" for me!  Kekou is on a non-descript part of a residential neighborhood street and one would not expect to find this shop here.  If you are ever near Toronto Chinatown or the Kensington marketplace area - this is a must try destination!"}
{"text":"Had the whiskey green tea and loved it! The whisky was not to overpowering and was a perfect complement to the green tea. It is actually fairly big inside compared to other ice cream/gelato's shops which is nice. Given that is $3 a scoop (which is fairly generous in size) and the abundance of flavours, I will definately be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"Kekou really needs to stay open year round. Amazing experimental flavours of ice cream, non-dairy options (for the lactose intolerant and vegan crowd) and an orange cider that made the husband and I have the most vivid dreams of our lives. Crazy stuff, really. Please open your doors one again Kekou. We miss you."}
{"text":"This place is just the best! Tea and gelato AND actually tasty and creative vegan options!  I love their extensive tea menu and all the different vegan options to try. I like that the flavour palate includes lots of Asian fruits, it really sets them apart from more traditional gelato places.  I think the serving sizes are just perfect and I really like that nothing is overly sweet. The alcohol based gelatos look delicious as well.. very creative!  Service is very friendly and patient, space is cute and relaxing despite the kind of busy and loud area.   I'm a big fan and always make a point to go in when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"Man, I must have good karma or something, because I got to try Kekou before they closed for the winter months. They're re-opening in March people! That's like 4 months from now!!!! This girl was totes happy that she squeezed a gelato sesh in before they closed their doors.  The shop is super cute! They have an old school fast-food takeout board which lists all the Gelato and Sorbetti flavours. Some of the selections last night included Vietnamese Coffee, Soursop, Soy Milk, Green Tea Pistachio, Mango, Chocolate Wasabi, Black Sesame, etc. They're all store in those uber chic stainless steel cylinders a la Grom. Fancy :)  I got a small cup of Durian and Sticky Rice. The Durian was very flavourful, lots of big durian flavour, though I found that it was a tad on the sweet side for my taste.   Loved the sticky rice. What an innovative idea! It has the flavour profile and texture of Thai Coconut Sticky Rice. Very Frozen Rice Pudding-esque. Points for deviating from the norm :)  Damn, did I mention that they are closed for the next 4 months?!?! The plan is that they are going to work on developing more flavours, and improving the quality of the product over the winter months.  Can't wait to return in March!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around lunch time on a hot summer day. There were a lot of people outside but there was no line inside. I tried a sample of the Viet Coffee and HK milk tea and decided immediately to go with those two flavours in a cup . I liked the HK milk tea more but I'm going through a tea phase right now. My favourite thing about Kekou's gelato though is that it is not overly sweet. I don't like overly sweet desserts and to me, the sweetness level was perfect to let the taste of the flavours come out.  Since it was a hot day, the gelato was very refreshing. I would definitely come back to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"This is a great gelato place, and the fact that they have Asian-inspired flavours makes it even better.  I have been dreaming of Vietnamese-coffee flavoured ice-cream for the longest time, and they have it!  Tried 4 flavours: peanut-sesame, mango, Vietnamese-coffee and ginger-milk.  My favourite was peanut-sesame. The staff were very attentive and let me try a bunch of other flavours. One drawback is the lack of seating."}
{"text":"I am usually a frozen yogurt fan, but I love the gelato here!! First of all, the flavors are very unique, they have flavors like spicy mango and soursop, those two flavors really remind me of my home in Trinidad, where we have soursop ice cream and also we have a snack called \"Mango Chow\" which is basically spicy mangoes.  They also have an excellent black sesame and cashew gelato, the black sesame actually have crunchy toasted black sesames in them. The gelato isn't super sweet, and is nicely balanced, they are smooth and creamy and has great added texture. The owner was super nice and was super accommodating, they allow you to try as many flavors as you want, and does not make you feel bad about being undecided and wanting to try more. All the flavors just seem so exciting!   There is a small, medium, large and take out XL size. My friends and I all got smalls which was about $4 after tax, since we had just eaten a huge meal, the small actually contain quite a bit of gelato. Anyways will return to fatten myself up for winter!"}
{"text":"Way too sweet.. we had the rice wine, and whisky green tea.  Both of them taste like alcohol + sugar...  end up after a few bite.. it went to the garbage bin.... disappointed.."}
{"text":"Not the most conventional place in terms of flavours but that doesn't detract from how good it is! I tried the Hong Kong milk tea and Vietnamese coffee, both were excellent and reasonably priced at $5 for two generous scoops. This location is seasonal but they run all year at the Queen St W branch so make sure you visit one soon because it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing fusion with traditional Italian gelato and Asian flavours!! Loved the creativity and feel of the place!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place from their unique gelato flavours, kind service and benches outside to sit and enjoy the warm weather.  Tried the black sesame and the HK milk tea and both were amazing! The HK milk tea is by far my favourite and tastes just like drinking the iced milk tea.  I will be back again and often to try out the other flavours."}
{"text":"Addicted. I've been going here since they opened. So sad when they close down for the winter time!!  All the flavours are very different. All my experiences were pleasant. The shop always has a line, but it moves on by rather quickly. A nice atmosphere and seating inside + outside.  My favourites have to be: vietnamese coffee, red bean white chocolate, greenbean coconut and HK milk tea. Be sure to get their stamp card!"}
{"text":"Very unique Gelatos. Lots of tropical and Asian flavors."}
{"text":"The gelato is always good here, and today was no different. I was glad to see some new flavours along with some regular ones. Today we shared a pint of Rosewater Pistachio and Durian. My one complaint is that they have changed scoopers to a more traditional ice cream scoop and this means the two flavours are one on top of the other instead of side by side. Otherwise, as delightful as I expected."}
{"text":"Worth the hype!!  This cute little gelato shop incorporates asian inspired flavours into their gelato. You can read all about their special practices on their website! It's really fascinating to see how they stray away from traditional preservatives and how their product is made and stored.  Anyways onto the actual product, the gelato was so incredibly mind blowing. Maybe I've over exaggerated a bit but I think it really deserves the hype! Pistachio will always be my go to just because of how accessible and familiar it is but I love their take on nontraditional flavours.   The prices were super reasonable compared to other gelato/ice cream places. Although somewhat of a tight squeeze, the staff were impeccably friendly and made sure we were taken care of. The lines also moved very quickly.   I sampled the tsing tao peach and whiskey green tea which had strong hints of alcohol but wasn't at all unpleasant. The flavours stayed really true to the ingredients and tasted bold and fresh.   I ended up ordering a large for $5.50 with 3 scoops: durian, mung bean coconut and osmanthus plum. Loved everything I got and once again, the flavours stayed really true to the ingredients and not one bit artificial tasting.   Overall... I am just beyond excited for my next visit here lol. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Flavours are so creative and fun.    Came here for the first time a week ago and there was a huge crowd already hanging out outside.  Gelato flavours rotate so there's always lots of options (and lots of reasons to keep coming back!) Staff were super nice in letting me try tons of flavours."}
{"text":"Yes, yes to EVERYTHING about Kekou. I had been waiting to try this place out for years, and finally got around to doing so once it opened its doors again this summer (it is closed during the winter time.) This place is gelato on steroids, and take it from someone who has been to Europe: this place takes gelato and steps it up a notch, putting Kekou gelato in a league entirely of its own.  Tips on how to eat Kekou gelato:  1) Wait and count down the days until it opens for the summer impatiently 2) Step inside the adorably decorated, cozy and quirky gelato parlour. 3) Admire its wide variety of flavours. Whiskey green tea?HK milk tea? Vietnamese iced coffee? Sweet and spicy pineapple? Beer-infused peach sorbet? Osmanthus plum berry? Avocado banana?! THIS is a place that does fusion, and does it right. East meets West in the innovative flavours that Kekou has to offer, and I had fun trying A bunch of them.  4) Speak to the friendly servers. They clearly enjoy their job and are proud to serve what they serve 5) are those...wait, what? Sugar cones, waffle cones, and SEAWEED INFUSED WaffLe CONES?! I haven't yet tried the seaweed, but if you have, please let me know.  6) Leave happily with a cone or cup of absolute deliciousness. Nearly faint with joy inside over every bite of pure, cold indulgence. Savour the taste of summer.   Location: Unassuming, adorably decorated, and cozy, Kekou is nestled on Baldwin Street. It is spacious enough, with outdoor benches, to bring a small group of friends.  Top fave flavours: Vietnamese coffee and spicy and sweet pineapple. You can actually taste the heat, and it is amazing!  Tip: Ask for a stamp card. I have been back twice in the past two days. Trust me, you will make use of it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Vietnam coffee, Durian, peanut butter black sesame were my favourites. Perfect for a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Despite the use of traditional Pozzetti cabinets (which keep out contaminants, air and sunshine) for their gelato at Kekou, you'll still get a hit of the distinctive, pungent, and often polarizing aroma of durian when you walk through the door. Durian is one of the many unique Asian-inspired flavours of gelato that will tantalize your taste buds.  No matter what your opinion on durian is, it shouldn't deter you from enjoying the other premium, true to taste flavours such as Hong Kong Milk Tea, Viet Coffee, Roasted Oolong Tea, Black Sesame, Avocado Banana. The HK Milk Tea has authentic intense flavours while the Black Sesame is loaded with delicious seeds. The avocado banana is lavishly creamy and contains real banana, not that artificial stuff. The sorbets such as Tsing Tao Peach, Spicy Salted Pineapple, and Sour Sop are top notch.  Tsing Tao Peach captures the soul of the beer with a hint of peach while Spicy Salted Pineapple boldly plays with sweet, salty, spicy, and acidic elements. You can get your stabilizer-free gelato or sorbet in a sugar cone or in a cup. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Kekou has some of the coolest most unique places I've seen in a gelato house. The shop is in the interior of a house and it feels super cute and cozy. There is no AC so you might prefer to eat your gelato on one of the benches outside. This is the perfect ending to a Baldwin Village lunch or a sunny afternoon in the city. It's one of those places downtown that can make the city feel small again. Just be careful of the flavours. They can be really strong. It's free to sample any flavours and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"Wow.   We passed this gelato bar on our way to Kinton and decided to check it out for dessert post dinner. They had a variety of \"non-traditional\" gelato flavours, most of which are asian inspired.  From the list they had, my boyfriend and I tried 4 of them: HK milk tea, whiskey green tea, tsing tao peach, and avocado banana.   Let me just say, the HK milk tea gelato was soooo good. Very rich in milk tea flavour. It was definitely my favorite of the 4. The alcohol infused ones were decent, tsing tao peach reminded me of peach schnapps. And avocado banana - more banana than avocado but still delicious.   I noticed in the take out menu they had toasted pistachio. I sure hope the next time I go they have that for me to try!"}
{"text":"Been here several times since it opened last year. They certainly live up to the title of an Asian gelato place. Their gelato flavours asian inspired and taste like what they say they are. Very rich in flavour. They've also got some unique flavours such as whiskey green tea."}
{"text":"Everybody was giving them a good review, so I tried. I was not very impressed. It was never bad, but it was not that excellent. The menu was very interesting. There were many unique flavours I cannot imagine. The shop was cute. Staffs were nice. They gave me a card which would give me a free gelato after several times purchase and I liked it."}
{"text":"Cute space and delicious gelato. Very interesting flavor selections and they're all homemade in house with good ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is a vice for me, being so close to my place! I've noticed the prices have gone up every year, but the scoops are still relatively inexpensive at ~$3/scoop. My favourite flavour is definitely rosewater pistachio, but I really appreciate the staff's willingness to offer samples as soon as you ask! The Queen St. W location is much bigger but this place has it's own charm being located in the cozy Baldwin Village."}
{"text":"I am never coming back here again, ever!! Kekou first opened shop sometime this summer. I used to come here all the time during August, the gelato was soooo good then. Ususally, I used to get the Vanilla Lotus Seed and the Vietnamese Coffee. Then, they added new flavours and hired some new staff . They added Wasabi Chocolate, and I wanted to try that. That time, the service wasn't too enthusiastic, I noticed they didn't seem the most attentive to customers. I even saw one of the female employees texting while I was being served, not the greatest customer service at all.  I ended up getting the Wasabi Chocolate and the Soursop. The Soursop was so hard and icy, like it's been freezer-burned and too old to eat, and the Wasabi Chocolate didn't do it for me. I love wasabi and chocolate, but that flavour was a HUGE disappointment, mediocre at best. I thought it might have been an off day, so I went back a few days later.  I came back again, hoping that this time is going to be better. It was worse. I had the Avocado Banana and the Vietnamese coffee, 2 safe flavours that I bought before. The Avocado Banana tasted like the bananas they used had browned too much, and the Viet. Coffee was slop, more liquid than solid, and tasted off too. The coffee flavour wasn't as strong as they used to make, and I found many coffee grinds in it too! Not only that, one of the male employees was a bit rude to me and my friends, I think he was the owner.  That being said, I won't be coming back here again. Kekou's gelato was the best during the summer. I loved their product, it was divine. Now it's Fall, I guess their time has come and gone. I used to think highly of this shop, but it's changed, and for the WORST!"}
{"text":"I have been to Kekou numerous times and every single time Kekou is clutch and satisfies my sweet tooth. On my most recent visit it was a hot Friday afternoon and I got a scoop of their newer flavours - almond tofu gelato.  It was just sweet enough to not leave that sugary after taste in your mouth and it was perfect for a hot afternoon.  At this location they don't have soft serve so I'm very excited to visit the Queen St. location to try their soft serve next time :)"}
{"text":"The spicy salted pineapple gelato was wonderfully refreshing on a hot summer day. My friends tried the HK Milk Tea and Vietnamese Coffee which were also delicious. I really appreciated the unique Asian-inspired flavours at this place. In particular, the pineapple had a nice sweet/spicy kick.  Service was friendly and efficient. Reasonably priced at $3 (incl tax) for a small cup. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"There were so many options! So many options that I've never even seen, but boy am I glad I tried a few of them. I had the sour sop, which was absolutely spectacular and Vietnamese coffee, which wasn't as good as what I had hoped (I was expecting it to be like the coffee itself). Nonetheless, the staff was great, the place clean, it's located in a nice little pocket in the city, and the business itself is actually run out of what looks like a converted house, which is wicked.  Definitely stop by, because I think you're in for a surprise."}
{"text":"Second time here and it isn't my last.   This location opened up and so much more convenient for me. I came by on a random Thursday evening and no surprise... it was packed! It seems like this location has more to offer compared to their first location. They have soft serve and even smoothie/drinks. I was really intrigued by the jasmine tea soft serve. First of all, jasmine tea is my all time favourite and now its serves as a soft serve. It was a no brainer. I didn't even have to ask to try because I already knew I would love it... and I did. If you're a big fan of the 'tea' flavour. You'll enjoy it as much as me but if you're not a big fan of it. you may have to stick with the gelato. The jasmine soft serve isn't too sweet, and has the strong flavour of jasmine.   Boyfriend got the black sesame and rosewater pistachio gelato. He loved it. I wasn't a big fan of the rosewater pistachio, the rosewater was way too strong for me.   I recommend that you forget Sweet Jesus and Artic Bites and come by for some sweet and delicious gelato.   Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"really liked the durian one, it is made with real durian and tasted very creamy. when you enter the store, you can smell the durian, not sure if it is a turn off for some customers, but  if you are bold, please try, you will get addicted to it.  it is next door to the arctic bites place which always have a huge line up, this would make an awesome alternative"}
{"text":"During a trip to Toronto last week that spanned 3 nights, I had Kekou Gelato all three nights.  Yes, it was that delicious.  Hailing from NYC, I come from a place where there's plenty of gelato and ice cream spots around town, such as Chinatown Ice Cream Factory.  However, CICF doesn't even come close to Kekou when it comes to interesting Asian-inspired flavors.  There are no seats inside, but plenty of seats outside.  From what I've heard, it's rumored that this place doesn't stay open during cold season.  As many have said, the flavors here taste exactly like they sound like.  Of the three times I visited, I had the following:  - Durian - tastes JUST like fresh durian, but it's not fresh durian.  Seriously.  It's an acquired taste and smell for sure, but for durian lovers, this is a must. - Oolong milk tea - I preferred this over the HK milk tea... tastes just like the real thing and actually has a lot of tea flavor in it - Avocado banana - this is really rich and thick but the two actually make for a delicious combination.  It's definitely a heavier option - Soursop - I love soursop!  It's light, tangy, and refreshing. - Osmanthus berry - you can barely taste the osmanthus but the berry flavor is extreme. - You can actually taste the alcohol in the alcoholic flavors  They have many, many other varieties to choose from and honestly, they're all delicious.  I love the flavors they have here and the fact that they taste exactly like they're supposed to.  This is going to be a must-visit everytime I'm in Toronto from now on!  PS: they have frequent buyer punch cards, too!"}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars!   I can't believe this is my first time here even though I have lived in Toronto all my life. The gelato here is bomb! The price is high compared to other ice cream places ($3.95 for 1 scoop, $7.25 for 2 scoops + tax), but the flavours are unbeatable and quality. They allow you to taste after you have paid, which I think is a smart tactic as some people like to try many flavours and not buy afterwards.   We orders two 1 scoop cones - one durian and one almond tofu. The durian was like heaven in a cone. It reminds me of the durian ice cream I had in HK many years ago. It had a super strong durian taste with tiny durian pieces. The almond tofu was like tofu pudding with a strong almond taste - one of my childhood favourites.   I would highly recommend Kekou and my only wish for them is to open a location uptown."}
{"text":"Love how they let you taste them before you decide which ones you want. I recommend oolong milk tea and the mango. 2 Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday after dinner for some dessert.  I didn't know they opened up a location here too. It wasn't too busy I guess maybe because it's still so freeking cold here! But it's never too cold for ice cream for me ahah!   I parked at the lot right across $2 for 20 min parking. It was perfect! We went inside and it wasn't too busy. They had about 20 diff flavours of Gelato. I tested about 4 and chose 2. I think 1 scoop was about 3.50$ and 2 was 5.50$. I obviously chose 2 scoops.   I ended up getting oolong and jasmine tea flavour. Both delicious . The Gelato is actually huge ! Normally they're small portions but this was ice cream scoop size big. Would def go back but wouldn't ever line up for it."}
{"text":"Pretty good. All of the flavours are legit and taste amazing. I wish they had more soft-serve options though because that's been my favourite so far!"}
{"text":"Best gelato place. Love the flavours! Also love how the staff doesn't limit the amount you're allowed to sample before deciding on a flavour(s). The Queen Street location is just as good. Lastly, both locations offer a rewards card. For x amount purchased, you get a medium gelato for free."}
{"text":"Lots of delicious, unique flavours. The texture isn't as creamy/rich as many other gelato places but it's still really good. Have been here many times and plan on returning. They have a good selection of teas, too. Friendly service! My only beef with this place is that the seating kind of sucks - a few large communal tables that often have no seating room."}
{"text":"Great asian inspired gelato flavours! The only place downtown I know that has delicious smelly durian for all those durian lovers. It's one of those flavours that you either love, like or hate. I personally enjoy durian except for when I'm on a date! My favourite flavours are Vietnamese coffee, black sesame, HK milk tea, and durian. Sometimes they come up new flavours like spicy pineapple and Tsing Tao peach.  The service is always great and they have ice water to wash down the sugar on a hot day. BTW Mon - thurs or fri between 3:30-5:30 collect double stamps"}
{"text":"My favourite gelato place of all time. Kekou offers a variety of flavours, mostly Asian inspired. You can get anything from whisky green tea to durian. The flavours will often change as well from my understanding.  My favourite combination is Vietnamese coffee and HK milk tea. If I want something fruity, I will order mango. I like to try other flavours, but I love Vietnamese coffee so much, I feel like I'm missing out when I don't get it.   Seating is limited at this location: one bench inside and three longer benches outside. If you want more seating and more options, the location Queen St is ideal."}
{"text":"If it were just based on ice cream flavors and variety of options I would give Kekou 5 stars. However part of the experience of visiting this place is the ambiance and decor which unfortunately is 3 stars at best.  The sad decor and lack of seating aside, I tried the Thai Milk Tea ice cream while my boyfriend tried the Black Sesame one. We were both equally blown away by the punch of flavor from both our ice creams. It's one of those rare times where the ice cream tastes exactly like what it's advertised as, instead of a diluted artificial flavor. The only issue I had was there were too many unique flavors and options to choose from making it impossible to decide which 1 flavor I wanted to get. I'll definitely be stopping by again in the future!"}
{"text":"What to Order (Recommendations):  Strawberry-lychee, Vietnamese Coffee and Green-bean coconut. Feeling adventurous? Go for Durian, which actually is surprisingly good.   Highlights:  Decor & Seating: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Food Quality: 10/10 Food Originality: 10/10 Overall Experience: 10/10   Review of Experience:   First off, i RARELY give ANYTHING 5 stars. Legit, as good as it gets. Perfect experience, both from service to quality. The most freshest and original flavours I think i have ever had, and you can try as many flavours as you want (trust me, we tried ALOT). Extremely reasonable prices, especially for the neighbourhood it is in, and has comfortable seating outdoors.   On my list of \"Best of Toronto\"  Overall, very delicious gelato's with even more unique flavours! Definitely highly recommended! Service is amazing, more than graciously fulfilled my need to try out practically all the flavours."}
{"text":"Don't have a favourite yet but the Rosewater Pistachio does come pretty close to being my go to flavour. They have a loyalty card and I'm already close to getting my first free gelato.  My only criticism is that this place only stays open seasonally. I was definitely anticipating its reopening last month because this is the kind of lunch time treat that you want. Can't say that I have been to Arctic Bites (too big of a line up) but I do enjoy coming here. My only other suggestion to the staff here would be to concentrate on the line of customers and just ask your friends to join the line so that the line keeps moving."}
{"text":"This place is a yes for me, the gelato flavors are unusual but tasty. I think my favorite is their jasmine soft serve it is soo goood. They have moved to queen west."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! Kekou offers many unique flavours with or without dairy. The best thing is you can get 2 flavours in one cup!   -green tea whiskey tasted strange at the beginning but slowly grew on me! The alcohol in it was pretty strong, I was surprised, I got used to it the more I eat it.  -Spicy salted mango was another great one, i only tasted mango the first few seconds, then the spiciness kicked in when I was wondering where the spicyness was. We also found tiny piece of chili seed in it. This one is a dairy free one -roasted oolong tea tasted exactly how I expected it to taste like, not too sweet, loved the light bitter taste from tea -peach cocktail(or something like that) was also very good, this one was dairy free as well, very refreshing -black sea same is just surreal, hands down the best I've had in a while -roseate pistachio sounds amazing but it is a pea for me...  I am certainly looking forward to try some other flavours, full of surprises"}
{"text":"Really delicious and interesting Asian ice cream flavors! Tried the durian and rose water pistachio flavor. Also had the soft serve swirl of jasmine green tea and almond tofu which was top notch!"}
{"text":"Probably the best gelato place if you're looking for flavours that aren't regularly offered. They have some alcoholic ones, where you can taste the alcohol. They have durian and HK milk tea. But my all time favourite would have to be the rosewater pistachio. I always come for some and once you've had it, you can't go anywhere else. The decor is very cute. The place is really small but there are seats outside. Enjoy that gelato outside in the sun!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst gelato I have ever tried.  The gelato here tastes like water mixed with sugar and artificial flavour and lacks the rich, smooth and silky taste of good gelato. I tried the vietnamese coffee flavour after they recommended it as the most popular flavour... not very good at all.   The cones break apart easily and have an eggy taste to them.  These are definitely not real homemade waffle cones the way I am use to.   2 years ago there was a bookstore here and in the back they had a gelato stand that offered much better gelato than what they offer here now.   Not sure why the reviews for this place are so high, just blows my mind. The best gelato I have ever had was in London, at this place called Amorino. This was to die for, and coming here really made me miss those summer days in the UK.  Another place that offers great gelato is Atomica in Kingston ON."}
{"text":"The freshest gelato I have ever tasted! The service here is amazing and their selection is unbelievable.  Apparently they don't use any preservatives in their gelato which means they only make small batches, so you'll always get fresh gelato.  The durian gelato is an acquired taste (to me it tastes bitter) but I also tried the Vietnamese coffee and it was pretty amazing!  If you're in the area and want a cheap but amazing desert, pick Kekou Gelato House!"}
{"text":"Amazing and unique flavours, not too pricey. They have flavours such as Rosewater Pistachio, Peanut Sesame, Whisky Green Tea, Viet Coffee, and HK Milk Tea. Loyalty stamp card which makes me coming back!"}
{"text":"Decent but unexceptional gelato in the basement food court of Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"I've been to the Baldwin location many times before Kekou Gelato opened their Queen St W location. The Queen location is my preferred location now because it is more convenient, there is more seating, it serves the complete menu from gelato to hot beverages. I have written a detailed review under the Queen St  W location."}
{"text":"Rosewater Pistachio is amazingly good, it feels like a fresh breeze in a hot summer day! HK Milk Tea is unique and tastes exactly the same with real HK milk tea. Other flavors are also good but the Rosewater Pistachio eclipses all of them."}
{"text":"Overall: Best place to get great-valued unique-flavoured ice cream that actually taste good!  Location: Situated on Baldwin Street a couple minutes from St. Patrick Station.  Price: Around $5 for 2 scoops. They also have a stamp card because, honestly, you're coming back.   Food: They have really unique and delicious tea flavours, such as HK milk tea or roasted oolong, it's a great place to start. If you're feeling a bit more adventurous, there's salted spicey pineapple, rum and raisins, etc. Honestly, I'm not sure why these flavours aren't everywhere because I personally love them much more than the generic tastes! They're also really nice about letting you try flavours. The only issue is after trying 3, you have to heartbreakingly eliminate one, or binge on 3 flavours. I went there so much last summer (often by myself because there's no shame in self love), that I had to modify my route home just so I don't pass by it all the time."}
{"text":"One of the better gelato houses in the city. I tried durian (so intense and bright), black sesame (really deep and flavourful), chocolate ginger (surprisingly strong and almost too spicy but in the best way), Viet coffee (good but too basic for the amazing choices you have available to you here), and red bean and white chocolate (I'm a sucker for both red bean and white chocolate separately, so to have both was a dream come true.)  The prices don't even make sense. It's $2.85 for a small. Where else do you find that? I'm just going to live here."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening and there were no lines which was amazing on a hot day. Lots of people sitting outside eating their Gelato though which is always a good sign. Staff are happy to let you sample the different flavors to help you make your decison. I had the Peanut sesame which was delicious. Second time here and I'll  be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Gelato - creamy smooth and decadent yet somehow refreshing! Unique, exotic fruit flavours made with real ingredients. I'm a piggie so I tried tons of flavours while I was there, all of which I recommend!   Vietnamese Coffee - bomb diggity  Peanut Sesame - peanuty deliciousness without being too rich Black Sesame (Amazing! Even has bits of ground sesame for extra texture and authentic flavour)  Durian - definitely made with the real thing it was awesome  Sour Sop - one of the lighter of the flavours I tried, but very refreshing   All in all, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was recommended to check out this place years ago and I've been a royal costumer since. Tip is to go into the store and don't be shy. Ask them to taste all of the items with small spoon- after tasting the samples you can decide on which one you want to bring home with you. I love durian flavour because it's so authentic and even the smell of it is so good. I am used to having the real one, and trust me when I say it's gooood! Don't be afraid to try the new flavours and you'll find new favourite gelato place in Toronto-"}
{"text":"Good gelato. But don't get the hype. Unlikely to repeat. Plenty of Asian-inspired flavours."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato with no additives, no sweeteners. If you happen to be diabetic, or on a diet and you're craving dessert I nightly recommend trying Kekou Gelato because sugar levels are so low."}
{"text":"Went to this place on the weekend for a treat recommended by a friend. It was amazing! They have very unique flavours. I tried the HK milk tea and it was the best gelato I have ever had. My friend got the HK milk tea as well but mixed in with another flavour. I also tried some of my husbands choices, whiskey green tea (made with real whiskey, quite strong actually) and oolong milk tea. Right when you walk in, you know that they serve durian flavour gelato cuz of the smell. The shop is small, but there are 2 benches outside for you to enjoy your treat. In total for a small cone(1 scoop) and medium size cup (2 scoop) was around $7.   I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I wrote a review on kekou for the other location but I love this location in the summer. The outdoor seating is so cute in the warm weather. The only downside is how small it is inside but that doesn't matter then the ice cream is AMAZING. Try the HK milk tea and the whisky green tea!"}
{"text":"I have very high gelato standards, but this place was pretty delicious and good for the price. I got black sesame and soursop, both flavors I had never tried before and they were very flavorful and true to their name/description according to the employees there. I really appreciate when gelato flavors aren't consumed by sugar and are true to my expectations/experience with the taste they are mimicking, and kekou was on the money with that."}
{"text":"Oh dang soft serve is my thing and at Kekou gelato, they had some of the best Asian flavours I'd ever tried. I got to taste the roasted tea scooped gelato and it was amazing but my heart was set on the jasmine green tea and almond tofu swirl soft serve. It only came in one size and a small at that for 5 dollars. Pricy but so worth it. It was lighter in sweetness and the jasmine green tea was so flowery and perfect. The almond tofu is hard to describe but they go together so well. I wasn't so happy with the swirl as it was lopsided but the flavour and texture of the ice cream still deserve a five. It's also a huge plus everything is made in house with no stabilizers and the texture remains not icy! So good and definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato house! Had their HK milk tea and Vietnamese coffee flavours which were super intense and surprisingly refreshing! They serve up the perfect treat on any day of the year and in a prime easy to find location!"}
{"text":"Everything is made with real ingredients and that makes a huge difference, highly recommended! Love this place! Fav? Durian by far."}
{"text":"Unique flavors coupled with a friendly and accommodating staff.  Seasonal flavors make repeat visits even more worthwhile (as if there needs to be other reasons to visit)."}
{"text":"My favourite place for ice cream! The flavours are not only unique but they taste very genuine. Can't go back to eating store bought ice cream after this. Flavours I recommend: Milk tea Viet coffee Green bean coconut Spicy Pineapple  Durian :D"}
{"text":"Unique gelato flavours that are very tasty and made with the actual ingredients of that flavour.  I loved their strawberry lychee but it's  out of season now.  I tried durian as a sample (they are happy to offer lots of tasters) but it was too duriany for me but some might like it.  The girl told me they use real durians to make it.  I really have enjoyed the black sesame, avocado banana and mango so far.  My friend loved her Vietnamese coffee flavour.  The fresh cones are really delicious too.  I like the sesame cone."}
{"text":"I COME HERE SO MUCH IT MAKES MY WALLET CRY. it's not expensive don't get me wrong.. i just come too often because i'm obsessed they have got delicious flavours and you can always get 2 flavours with whatever size you decide to buy and they even sell it in pints. my favourite by far are the coffee and tea flavours. so delicious! oh ane the baldwin location is closing soon but IT'S OKAY BECAUSE THEIR NEW LOCATION WILL SOON BE OPEN"}
{"text":"YUMMY! Another good dessert place on Baldwin! Simple interior, clean looking metal pots of Gelato, and a short but super sufficent menu list of flavours. They also allow us to try some flavours which is nice since some of them sound a little fishy at first. Matcha with whisky or rum with condensed milk?!   I tried the black sesame and the flavour was really strong but it tasted peanuty LOL and I'm pretty allergic to that. I got the roasted oolong milk tea which was close to the actual thing :) it tasted similar to my friends HK milk tea. I also got the red bean white chocolate. It was pretty good, but it tasted more like vanilla and needed a bit more red bean flavour ! Both were very very smooth and creamy and dense.  I got it on a waffle cone which was very fresh and crispy and saved some of the Gelato from dripping everywhere. For 2 scoops in a waffle cone, less than 5 dollars. Very worth it!  Cute benches inside and outside with strung lights from the neighbouring store to sit and talk on too!"}
{"text":"The durian gelato is probably the most disgusting thing I've ever had, but the staff were all very friendly and luckily let me sample it before committing to buy a bigger portion.  Those scoopers were full of smiles, which I liked. They were willing to entertain my requests to sample half of all of their offerings. Maybe they're used to it by now, since they do offer a wide variety of interesting flavors - hk tea, roasted oolong, some kind of plum and peach flavors, durian (blergh). I found a couple of flavors I liked and grabbed a large, which includes three flavor choices. They cram that cup full, so I got my money's worth.  Really, it's not a place I would go out of my way to visit, but the combination of unique flavors and friendly staff made my visit pleasant. I'd definitely return if I were in the area.  The place isn't open year round though. I visited earlier in May and the place was closed. Give them a call if you're going out of your way to come here, especially if it's not June-August."}
{"text":"Excellent gelato shop for its rich, unique flavours and for its fair prices.  It is open at 3:30PM on Mondays-Thursdays (I think) so don't be depressed if you see it closed on a morning gelato run! They don't serve the typical Italian gelato flavours here--think more Asian fusion. I love the HK milk tea, black sesame and white choc & red bean flavours. Tried roasted oolong but the HK milk tea was slightly more flavourful. There are different kinds of cones as well, such as regular and seaweed (the seaweed is not overwhelming which is nice).   There is \"happy hour\" from 3:30-5:30PM, where you can get double your stamps! The stamp card is great, and 9 stamps = 1 medium cup / 1 scoop on any cone / 1 cooler bag.   There is a small seating area with benches out front."}
{"text":"Interesting flavors. I did find their gelato to be on the unnecessarily too sweet side and that distract from the pure flavor. Gf had the osmanthus plumberry, and it was quite icy. Also there were too many seeds. They should've strained out some of the seeds. I had the roasted oolongtea, and that had good flavor...but too sweet."}
{"text":"This location doesn't have the ice cream bars or popscicles or sandwiches or floats and affogati."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at Kekou and I finally got to try the Jasmine tea flavour which is usually sold out according to my friend. It was a little too much for me, but it was pretty flavourful.  I also got the Viet tea and Black sesame this time. First time I was here I got the Spicy Mango, Hk milk tea and Green bean coconut.  The flavours are great but I wished they had more fruit flavours and maybe with chunks or real fruits would be amazing.  You can try before you order but it tends to get super busy so you do not want to start a large queue."}
{"text":"Pretty good asian flavour gelato. They don't have the typical european flavours but they do have nice asian flavours such as durian, jasmine tea, and black sesame.  Taste was quite good. Really enjoyed the flavours but the gelato wasn't creamy enough. Was still a solid place for gelato."}
{"text":"Like all the other reviews written here - it is seriously one of the best gelato places I've been.  The first time I had was the Tsing Tao Peach.  What a combination!  You can really distinctively taste the peach mix with the Tsing Tao (which is a Chinese beer btw).  It's sweet, refreshing (perfect for the summer) and you can a little tipsy from it.  Other flavors I recommend include the Green Tea Whisky, Makegolli, Viet Milk Tea, HK Style Milk Tea, Seasame (THE BEST!).  You can order 1 or 2 flavors.  If it's your first time, definitely do more variety so you can know which ones you like.  If you're with a few friends, get a wide variety and share!  They also provide sampling if you're not sure how it will taste like (very nice and friendly staff).  You can also buy a tube home if you definitely know you want more of this delicious stuff!  Remember to collect and bring your stamp card!"}
{"text":"The milk tea will always be my favourite, I usually buy a tub and bring it home."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite ice cream places in Toronto because I love the Asian inspired gelato flavors. My personal faves are whiskey green tea, rum condensed milk, and red bean white chocolate. I've also been meaning to try to viet coffee and HK milk tea for a while! The gelato is nice and creamy, and they also offer a variety of dairy free sorbets. It's around $4 for a scoop or $6.25+tax for 2 scoops.   My only complaint is that they no longer allow u to sample flavors without buying first. Previously I used to pop in all the time and the servers were very generous about allowing me to sample flavors so I could make an informed decision about purchasing. Now I feel too pressured to buy their gelato even if I end up not liking a new flavor."}
{"text":"Popped in today after a work lunch in Baldwin Village. My I ordered the black sesame (great!) and the vanilla lotus (good!). The girl serving was really friendly and helpful, and also let us try lots of flavours (first time in). All in all a great experience. I'll be back!  $5.50ish for a waffle cone with two scoops."}
{"text":"Amazingly refreshing flavours that are perfect for summer.  I sampled a few flavours, mango being my favourite. And ended up going with the passion fruit soft serve. It was delicious!   We ended up walking here after witnessing the unreasonably huge line at sweet Jesus. And it was totally worth it.  Gelato with an Asian twist - with flavours like durian, viet coffee, rose water, mango and etc. Definitely check it out! The staff was so friendly offering samples of things we wanted to try.  You won't get your usual flavours like  chocolate, straciatella, Nutella here. But the flavour profile here is  unique and delicious!! Perfect for a light refreshing summer dessert!"}
{"text":"This place has the best and most unique gelato flavours! They range from safe ones, like the HK milk tea and black sesame, to unconventional ones such as whiskey green, tea (keep away from the kids, contains alcohol), soursop and durian (requires an acquired taste). As you can tell, they have an extensive Asian-inspired selection; the associate also told me that they alternate the flavours seasonally.   I tried the oolong tea and Vietnamese coffee, and they were both delicious! It was also not too sweet so you don't get it sick of it half way into it. FYI, you get two flavours with the small/medium size, and don't forget to grab a points card!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for gelato love the flavours they have!  I got the HK milk tea which is my favourite one as well as their rose water pistachio was really good too.  I love how they let you try as much flavours as you wish which is honestly like a best part so you actually know what you are getting!   Will always come back here totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"Yes for the roasted oolong tea!! So refreshing for a humid summer day. The durian gelato has a stronger taste, but I still prefer the tea flavor. Moderate price. Just be careful when you hold the waffle cone cuz the gelato melts very fast.."}
{"text":"My new favourite gelato place! The flavours are Asian inspired and the texture of the gelato is smooth and creamy. I do notice that it melts a little faster than regular ice cream most likely because their ice cream is all natural, but that is okay since it will be gobbled up fast. :)  Also, you can always ask for a sample before committing to a flavour. Remember to get a stamp card if you will be making frequent visits. :)  So far I've tried, -Pistachio with Rosewater - Has a nice pistachio flavour with subtle hints of rosewater, the floral taste does not overpower the nutty pistachio  - Roasted oolong tea - Strong roasted tea flavour, not overly bitter and has a lingering taste after  - Green bean with coconut - Sweet coconut flavour with pieces of green bean in it, reminds me of eating  rice pudding  -  Whiskey green tea- Whiskey is strong! A little too overpowering for me. I prefer the Rum with condensed milk  - Viet Coffee- Strong espresso coffee flavour,  yummy!  - Rum and condensed milk - My favourite, the rum is not overpowering and goes well with condensed milk."}
{"text":"The lineups outside this spot are a testament to the popularity of this place. The flavors offered here are not the run of the mill kind offered at the corner store near you or your frozen item isle in your regular grocery store. The staff is nice and encourage you to try a lot of flavors before you commit. One can even split the small serving into two flavors.  I liked the Spicy Mango during sampling but ended up ordering Durian and Chestnut. Both were decent and if you enjoy those flavors you will appreciate them for sure. I will try some other flavors on the next visit. They also had some samples for tea. One of the spiced one actually gave me a headache so tread lightly before sampling. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"So many Asian-inspired flavours!    Spicy mango, guava with plum, HK milk tea, peanut and sesame, vietnamese coffee, etc...  The list goes on!  You can get two flavours in the small or medium cups, three flavours in a large.  You can also purchase a larger styrofoam container for take-out.    Don't forget to ask for the frequent buyer's card!  I'm sure you will be back!"}
{"text":"My favourite gelato place with such unique Asian flavors! These ice creams are quite accurate to their food counterparts, such as the Vietnamese coffee and HK milk tea. They have some alcohol infusions too, such as whiskey green tea and rum & sweetened condensed milk. It's an amazing place to try some unique flavours that are all very delicious--although the durian flavour is arguable. This Kekou location has less seating than the one on Queen Street, but it has a bit more of a homey vibe. The staff here are all very nice and have quick service. You can sample the ice creams before you choose one too!  Note: 1 scoop is a little smaller than 2 scoops, but you get to have 2 flavours with 2 scoops. I would recommend getting a 1 scoop for a bit more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! This is definitely my go-to for gelato flavours that you really can't get anywhere else...everything from Whiskey Greentea to Durian to Rosewater Pistachio. Their most popular flavours (HK tea, Viet Coffee) are super yummy, but my fav right now is their Black Sesame and Avocado Banana (tastes even better together!!) I've also had their Soursop and Oolong Tea gelato, which were refreshingly delicious. The staff is super friendly and are more than happy to let you taste as many different flavours as you want before buying. Although the decor could use a little work, I won't complain because a medium gelato (2 flavours) costs only $5--which is super affordable and honestly so worth it. Kekou is definitely killing it."}
{"text":"Had the chance to try this place on a very hot day and loved the gelato. Tried three flavours - Vietnamese coffee, strawberry lychee, and black sesame and all of them were delicious and full of flavour. Price wise it was reasonable and everyone eating outside and inside the store looked happy with their gelato."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service.  They let us try everything, were always smiling and informative.  Really - both girls were so great!  Customer service for the win!  EVERY FLAVOUR WE TASTED WAS GOOD.  THIS MADE THINGS SO CONFUSING.  I wish I hadn't just eaten dinner...now I know better.  No \"stand-outs\" because everything was good.  For just a little adventure, get the dark chocolate ginger.  For a lot of adventure, get the durian.  :)"}
{"text":"TL;DR Every icecream here is gold. But my fvaourites are Green Tea Whiskey, Rum and Condensed Milk, Almond and Tofu, Vietnamese Coffee, Durian, and PISTACIO ROSEWATER IS A MUST GET 4 ME I CANT LIVE WITHOUT IT.   Kekou has never failed me. No matter which location (so far only two), time of day, who my company is, how lit I get. I mean the icecream here makes my life worth living sometimes ya know? ITS JUST THAT GOOD.  As a person who comes from southeast Asia, every flavour here hits home hard. I'm talking like a bullet train at like 400 km/h. Not only does the train ram my mouth back home, what comes with it is a whole welcoming party of all the countries around my homeland. The icecream brings the bustling cars and motor cycles on the left with street music playing and people screaming there's fresh buns for only 14k.   It relieves my homesickness and also it makes me really glad that I'm in Canada and that there are restaurants and dessert parlours like these that bring home to where I am.  Do yourself a favour and try all the flavours. Go on a journey if you're not familiar with the east an enjoy the ride. Go to Kekou."}
{"text":"The few desserts in my life that I will ceaselessly continue to enjoy until my inevitable death include: ice-cream and 3 kinds of pie (a la mode).  I was already stuffed from dinner that I had just scarfed down less than 20 minutes ago, but Kekou was on my list of \"must eats,\" so I soldiered on.  When I got there and saw the various flavours and was hit by a wall of the oh-so-amazing durian aroma.   The milk tea was amazing, it tasted like the real stuff and maybe even better. It's great when paired with the Tsingtao peach and osmanthus. Another combination I recommend would be the durian, whiskey green tea, and soursop - simply heavenly. Texture was smoother than Barney Stinson, hands down.   I was on vacation and had a packed schedule but still made time to get down to Kekou every night for five days. That's how good it is."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of gelato but definitely a big fan of the flavours they have here. You can get a small size with two flavours for $3.75. They also offer samples which is good because I wanted to try durian without actually committing to it. The conclusion is no I would never get it. However, I did end up getting the black sesame, and the staff suggested I try it with peanut sesame. Glad she did because I preferred the peanut sesame more. They do take-away as well, I believe it's $9 for a pint.   I definitely understand why this place is so popular. They offer new and exciting Asian inspired flavours such as Durian, Hong Kong Milk tea and Tsing Tao Peach, which is a nice change from the usual. It was really nice to see so many people enjoying gelato inside and outside the place. I hope to make it out again before the end of summer."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing gelato. Tried the Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, oolong tea, and whiskey green tea. My favorite would be the Vietnamese coffee, then oolong tea! It was about $3 something for one scoop. There's only a couple chairs to sit inside and benches outside. If I ever go back, I would try all the other flavors. This is a must go to place of you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"TRY ALL THE FLAVOURS. I'm kidding, sort of. There is wide range of eclectic and exotic flavours in this shop. Depending on which location you go, and when you go, you may be able to get soft serve (like almond tofu and tea swirl). But even if you don't get to try their soft serve, they have great flavours behind the counter to choose from. Some of my favourites include the Hk milk tea and the Vietnamese coffee - both tasting rich and authentic.  They also have a stamp card and you can buy pints of their icecream too so you'll never need to leave your house again..."}
{"text":"Great place. Gelato flavours are asianified but still had a great smooth texture. People serving you are very friendly and owners make multiple batched until they get the perfect consistency and smooth flavour! Definitely coming back :3"}
{"text":"I seriously come here too often. The place always has the perfect asian fusion gelatos. I have tried vietnamese coffee, hk milk tea, oolong tea, tsing dao peach, advocado banana and a couple more that I can't remember off the top of my head. Never disappointed. Every scoop is super flavourful and yummy.   5starts in my heart! =)"}
{"text":"If you love gelato and want to try some unique flavours, this is the place to go. They have Asian inspired flavours like Black Sesame and Whiskey Green Tea. I got the Roasted Oolong Tea which was amazing. Like most other gelato places, you can try some flavours before committing to one (or two).   One scoop with one flavour came up to $3 after tax. Two scoops with two flavours is $5 after tax."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's only been my second time but I'm hopeful it will be far from my last :) Kekou is one of the few places that is dead against including products like gelatin/random preservatives and stabilizers and is thus a really inviting place for people who want a fairly clean treat that isn't boring :) The storefronts are relatively unassuming but the taste of the food is great, and there are eclectic options for vegans and non-vegans alike :) I've had the red bean white chocolate before (my two favourite flavours combined? Yussss please) and most recently the HK Milk Tea. These aren't heavy hot fudge brownie sundae types of desserts - the flavours are much more subtle, but still (in my opinion) absolutely delicious. Although it's a little pricey ($3.75 for one scoop), I think it's worth a try! If you're daring, try the durian and tell me how it is :D"}
{"text":"The Vietnamese coffee and mango flavours were delicious, and the gelato was reasonable priced! They let you try the flavours and warn you to try flavours before you purchase some of the ones that cater more to an acquired palette"}
{"text":"Love Kekou!!! Best ice cream or gelato I've had.  Love the use of Asian flavours in most of their selection such as Hong Kong style milk tea as one of my personal favourites.   Always fresh and packed with flavour, creamy and thick doesn't taste like it's been puffed up with air like some ice creams or gelato.   Was on Baldwin but I think it's been moved to Queen West !"}
{"text":"favourite flavour - vietnamese coffee!  @hangrymann"}
{"text":"This spot simply blew me away with its creativity. I was not expecting to experience the same familiar texture of Gelato paired with Asian-inspired flavors. It really IS Asian Gelato!  And what exciting flavors to choose from.   I tried the avocado-banana, peanut sesame, and spicy mango. The avocado-banana and peanut sesame were outstanding. Personally, I'm a huge fan of both these fruits and Kekou's Gelato elevated these flavors to a whole other level. All their flavors were also not sugary, which I loved.   The only downside is the limited seating outside. No inside seating."}
{"text":"Perfect gelato spot! Combine specialty asian flavours and mighty gelato!!   I had the durian (some people might hated that) and black sesame gelato, it's so creamy and good I want to cry!!! I always loved gelato over ice cream, and Asian flavours over the usual. This place combine two of my favourite so I am loving this spot, will visit whenever I am around the neighbourhood.   P.S. Gelato is less fattening than ice cream"}
{"text":"this was my first time trying Asian-inspired flavoured ice cream and i dont know if ill ever go back to eating regular ice cream. they have an array of unique flavours and at your request are able to sample them. i went with 2 scoops on a sugar cone; black sesame and Hong Kong milk tea. i was so blown away on how amazing the flavours were! i thought the milk tea flavour would be washed out by the cream and sugar of the ice cream but it was like i was eating bubble tea. also for the price they give you a HUGE portion. totally would recommend if you want to try unique ice cream flavours on a budget!"}
{"text":"The gelato here is very good! Everyone who we have shared this with absolutely love it. We have had the viet coffee, durian, green tea, oolong tea. So glad we have a good asian gelato joint in the city. Dont have to wait to go to Montreal to get it from Kem Co Ba anymore!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after eating ramen and lovedddd it!!! I didn't expect such natural flavours considering they offered so many different types of unusual flavours. Upon entering, the workers allowed me to try as many flavours as I wanted. The flavour is not artificial at all and is very delicate. I had the strawberry lychee (sorbet; non-dairy) and the milk tea (dairy), which were both fantastic. Would love to visit again!!  The price is right for gelato. Especially because we get to have two flavours in a cup!"}
{"text":"This place had been on our list to check out for a while but we were never remembering it when we were in the area until one of those disgustingly hot days came along and we happened to walk past. And oh my god. Why hadn't we gone before??   The place was super packed but they were getting orders out really fast. We opted for the ready made icecreams anyways and didn't have to wait.   There's a decent amount of seating and cold water available so that's always good"}
{"text":"Came in here for a treat with my mother and we were not disappointed. Excellent customer service and the flavours are just incredible. This is some of the best gelato I've had in Toronto. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love gelato? On a sunny day it's the perfect way to cool down, and satisfy that sweet or sour craving. If you don't like gelato get a Vietnamese coffee or some tea.   The staff here were super friendly. There are tons of gelato flavours to try. After asking to sample several different types of gelato the guy was still really accommodating. He kept a smile on his face the whole time.   The gelato is unique in that the flavours are Asian inspired. I ended up ordering soursop and spicy mango. I enjoyed the spicy mango because it had a nice kick at the end. It breaks up the sweetness of the mango. Next time as a refresher I'm going to get their lemon chrysanthemum gelato."}
{"text":"5* for taste 3* for terrible experience  Waited patiently for 10-15 minutes (granted there was a couple in front of me deciding on what it seems to be their last scoop of ice cream they'll ever have in their life) anyway some dude walks in and gets served within the minute. Maybe this dude should of noticed I was next in line, sure, but he is a customer and usually aware about what is happening, but the counter staff should of said \"Yo Yo Yo ice cream counter man! That chicka was next!\" Or a simple \"so who's next?\"  Or maybe I should of drawn my eyebrows in a more angular bold shape so people would be intimidated by my face, serve me and take me seriously.  I know it's not a big deal but no one likes waiting in line for 15 minutes for food and then not getting served when they are next.  Besides that I enjoyed the flavours, unique, exotic flavours that are not overly sweet."}
{"text":"A small place tucked in Baldwin village. They offer a variety of unique asian flavours such as Hong Kong Milk Tea, Vietnamese Coffee, Spicy Mango. It's a perfect treat for a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Mango gelato tastes so fresh and feels like you're eating the real thing. Everything from here tastes like it's been made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Stopped in to scope out and try some exotic-sounding gelato and it was love at first sight!  The durian flavour is a dream...but be sure that you actually love durian as it is a love or hate fruit!  Durian flavour was so rich and creamy.  Our group tried out essentially the entire menu and nods of approval all around!"}
{"text":"2 words: BLACK SESAME! I know it looks unappealing to some, but it's a must try flavour! If you like black sesame in any other Asian dessert, you will LOVE it here. I've even made black sesame ice cream at home, but it just tastes better when someone makes it and scoops it for you.   They also have a ton of other flavours - be sure to ask to sample some before you pick one. The milk tea and red bean flavours are some of my favourites. I personally think the flavours are relatively subtle, which I really like! Just the perfect amounts of sweetness.   They also now have a location on Queen West, in case you don't want to venture up to Baldwin."}
{"text":"Gelato and unique asian flavours, what's not to love? Whisky green tea was great, as is the more subtle and tasty jasmine tea gelato. Other unique flavours like avocado banana, peanut sesame and durian that make this place truly unique."}
{"text":"I had the Whiskey Green Tea and Roasted Oolong Milk Tea gelato.  Though my brother did not enjoy the Whiskey Green Tea as much, I thought both were very good. I suppose its very subjective. The whiskey green tea (made with real whiskey) had a hint of both flavors so it wasn't too strong of either spectrums. Not enough whiskey to get a small kick but also not the richest green tea flavour I've had. Regardless, I found the unique mixture of the two flavors quite enjoyable and innovative! The roasted oolong was nice and rich on the other hand. It was just like having an ice cream version of bubble tea minus the tapioca.  The price is standard for any gelato.. which isn't cheap. Not expensive, but not something you can get on a regular basis. (Unless you drink a frappucino everyday - then maybe you do live that life)  I would also like to point out that the service was great. The employee was patient and kind, allowing me to try many of the different flavors before ordering. I didn't feel rushed nor bothersome so thumbs up for that.   For such a small store, there's a really cute seating area outside so it's quite accommodating. I would definitely go again to try another flavour another day."}
{"text":"It was negative 6 degrees outside and I knew I HAD TO GET MY GELATO FIX.  Today was the first day I visited ever since Kekou renovated. Now there is extra seating, two tables at the front, and 3 larger tables in the back of the store. There is also wifi for people who'd like to sit down, do some work, and eat delicious gelato! I got the durian gelato and delicious as ALWAYS with quick service. They have many drinks with prices that are on the same level as other bubble tea shops ($4.2~$4.7) but I think Kekou would have better bubble tea if the level of quality they strive for is the same as the quality for gelato. In addition, the Saigon Fog drink is coming soon! I'm excited especially for their Saigon Fog with Viet Coffee gelato and tapioca. So delicious and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Kekou offers a wide variety of unique flavours at a reasonable price.  My favourites are the Hk Milk tea and the yogurt gelato.  Everything is fresh and creamy.  It's a real treat!"}
{"text":"So adorable.  The staff are helpful and quick.  The flavours are so inspired by the husband and wife creators and owners.  I really enjoyed the black sesame and green bean coconut flavours.  If you like coffee then Vietnamese coffee is the way to go.  Next time will go for durian flavour!!  The small cup with 2 flavours is more than enough to satisfy my craving since they do a great job of packing them into the cup.  It is great that they have water for drinking and condensed milk available nearby.  Cute interior and adorable designs."}
{"text":"While I've tried and sampled other flavours, I'm writing this review purely because of their whiskey green tea. I'm an awfully predictable person when it comes to choosing gelato. One of my favourites is green tea, which can taste grassy and sweet with a hint of bitter. Before trying it, I already know what to expect. So whoever thought to spike the green tea with whiskey is something of a tipsy genius. It adds another element to the same-old, same-old, which makes it somewhat unique and exceptionally fun to eat as dessert!"}
{"text":"Got the Peanut sesame, HK milk tea, Vietnamese coffee, and green bean coconut! Love these flavors and overall recommended for some delicious smooth gelato. The flavors are so unique and the quality is so smooth and amazing. Service was also quick and friendly."}
{"text":"A wide variety Of interesting flavours. Good prices, friendly staff, cute little place. Wish there was more places to sit, inside and out."}
{"text":"My friends and I during our trip in Toronto suddenly developed a craving for durian. We found this place on yelp that serves durian gelato and decided to check it out and satisfiy our urges.  The place had a wide variety of unique flavors, we decided to get a pint of Hong Kong milk tea and durian gelato. The Hong Kong milk tea gelato was amazing, tasted just like the milk tea with a really creamy texture. The highlight of the visit, durian gelato. It was amazing, the taste of durian with the creaminess of gelato. There were bits of durian in the gelato as well, simply amazing. Will definitely come back for more durian and maybe try the other flavors."}
{"text":"Where Asian inspired flavours meet Italin gelato! I've been to this location twice, and both times the flavours have not disappointed me.  3/5 - Venue 5/5 - Food 4/5 - Overall  Venue: The location is tucked away in a quiet residential street, and offers a bench for outdoor seating, and two to three tables indoors. Nothing too upscale or nice inside, it's just a quiet gelato parlour. Great for a quiet little date, no music, not many distractions.  Food: The flavours change up every once in a while, and they offer interesting combinations such as red bean white chocolate, or almond tofu. If you enjoy Asian desserts, you'll love their flavours that are offered, and if you prefer more traditional takes, they have those as well, such as pistachio.  Overall: This place is great for a treat every once in a while, but at about $8.50 for a double scoop with waffle cone after tax, definitely not an every day snack. They do offer a stamp card, where after every multiple of 10 scoops, you get 1 free scoop or other item. They have a variety of pints or take away ice cream bars as well for purchase."}
{"text":"*Breathes deeply*   Kekou is the epitome of quirky, Asian-inspired fro yo and gelato.  If you've been to East Asia and was lucky enough to dine on the geographically \"exclusive\" durian and tofu flavoured ice cream/gelato, then you have to wiggle your behind over to Kekou!  Kekou manages to banish all elements of geographical boundaries, serving notable flavours, such as durian, almond tofu, Vietnamese coffee, jasmine tea, whiskey green tea, rosewater pistachio, and the list goes on.  Many of these dairy goodies are made in-house and none of them have preservatives, stabilizers, food colouring, dextrose, corn syrup, soy lecithin, and etc.  I give this a big thumbs up, because you see too many products out there labeled as \"frozen dairy desserts\" rather than desserts made with real milk and cream without all the unpronounceable chemicals and additives.   My usual go-to is the durian gelato, which comes to no surprise (re: my name).  This time around, however, I opted for the Rosewater Pistachio gelato and the Almond Tofu gelato, partly because I have been on the rosewater beauty bandwagon for some time now and partly because tofu has always been a great ingredient in East-Asian desserts for as long as I can remember.  Both gelatos had great flavour.  They didn't taste water-downed or too \"in-your-face\".  They tasted very refreshing, actually, so much so that you wouldn't think you were eating anything unhealthy at all!  Kekou's staff members are very friendly and are eager to let you sample any of their concoctions during your visit.  Need a cup of joe every morning? Then grab the Vietnamese Coffee.  Love your original bubble tea?  Try the HK Milk Tea or Jasmine Tea.  Need a bit of \"adult\" zing in your dessert? Then I highly recommend the Whiskey Green Tea (another personal favourite).  From what I've seen, they rotate their flavours, so sometimes you'll be lucky enough to find the soy bean/kinako gelatos and some other ginger varieties (right now, they have Chocolate Ginger, but I'm not a chocolate fan).    Kekou has been my HG dessert joint since its inception and I think it will remain in this place, even in the face of iHalo Krunch (which has charcoal and ube ice cream), Pablo (Japanese cheese tart master), and the ever-expanding Japanese cheesecake fad.  Their prices are very similar to those found at Dairy Queen, Basket Robbins, and etc., so there really isn't anything to lose!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in LOVE with the ice cream here. My favourite flavour is durian and I'm so glad somewhere in Toronto serves odd flavours for those with a preference and appreciation for more oriental flavours (guava, black sesame and taro to name a few). You can also get gelato to-go which is awesome. It comes in a large styrofoam container and its so satisfying to share with friends ^^"}
{"text":"My favorite gelato place in Toronto! Discovered this gem in Baldwin village last summer and I've been craving it since it closed for the winter.   I usually come for the HK milk tea flavor gelato. They allow you to pick two flavors when purchasing a medium or large. Red bean vanilla is another one of my favorites. There are several flavors to choose from and the employees allow you to sample them before purchasing a cup. Very cheap as well,  I don't think I've spent more than $5 at this place."}
{"text":"My favourite gelato spot in the city. The gelato is so fresh and creamy. Love the endless variety of unique flavours to choose from. Durian is one of my all-time favourites - tastes just like eating the real thing!   Very reasonable prices. Great gelato and friendly service.  I have been here multiple times and they never fail to disappoint! Will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to the Baldwin location but Ive been to the Queen location several times last summer. I really love the unique, Asian inspired flavours! And they have samples if you ask for it.   I decided to go with a scoop of HK Milk Tea gelato for $3.50 in a cup. Double scoop is $5.50 in a cup. The flavour was really unique and definitely satisfied the usual craving I have for milk tea! There was also iced water available for free which was awesome cause I was really parched by the time I came to kekou.   I recommend their tea flavours, their whiskey green tea flavour is intense but different and definitely tastes like its name.   Can't wait to come here more in the summer!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite gelato parlours. Absolutely love the rosewater pistachio flavor and their hong kong milk tea.  Never a long wait, and the staff are extremely friendly :)  Definitely worth a visit or two."}
{"text":"I've been coming several times a year since they first opened, and they're still the best!  Tried all the flavours, and appreciate that they add new ones every season.  My favorites are still the soursop and any of the tea-flavoured gelatos.  Their newer Queen Street location also has great soft-service ice cream.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been to a gelato house that offers asian-inspired flavours, so I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this place after walking past it a few times. I originally visited their Baldwin location, which is a lot smaller than their current Queen St. location. They let you try all the flavours before you order which ones you want. What I love about Kekou is that they make all their gelato flavours in store, so you know you're getting quality product. I got the HK milk tea and Green Bean Coconut flavours. Every time I come here, I HAVE to get the green bean coconut flavour. Hands down my favourite one if I had to choose between this one and the HK milk tea one. You can't really taste the coconut coming through, but you can with the green bean. It tastes SO GOOD. There is just something very calming and light about the green bean flavour that is so satisfying and heavenly.   Here's a break down of some of the other flavours I sampled:   Black Sesame. The flavour is super strong, it's kind of like eating the sweet black sesame dessert you can get at asian dessert places. If you love black sesame, this would be the flavour for you.  The Spicy Pineapple one is interesting. You first taste the pineapple before you get a small kick of spicy at the end. It's good, but very interesting. Nothing I've ever had before.   Their Whiskey Green Tea is made with actual alcohol, so you can definitely taste it coming though. I didn't get much green tea flavour as I would have liked though.   The Vanilla Lotus is basically vanilla flavoured gelato but filled with pieces of lotus seeds. Nothing special but if you like a bit of texture/bite to your gelato, go for it.   Durian. Not everyone will be a fan of this one, especially if you hate the fruit. I happen to love durian so this one was my cup of tea. The durian flavour is really strong, but delicious. It does not taste artificial at all, nor was it overly sweet. Tastes just like eating the fruit itself. Yum!   Since coming here last summer, they  changed their prices. It works out to be more expensive than before, I guess to make up for the missed business during the winter season. It costs $2.85 for one scoop, compared to $3.75 before. Although the price went down, so did the portion sizes. They use to fill the cups to the max before, like the one pictured. Now they only do two scoops which do not overfill the cup to make a dome shape. Kind of disappointing but I still love going here regardless. You can't beat their flavours here, nor can you find another shop that has HK milk tea or green bean coconut gelato.  UPDATE: For the summer they brought back their popular Jasmine Green Tea soft serve and boy does it not disappoint! It's not the typical heavy, creamy soft serve you would normally expect, more like a sorbet-like texture. But trust, IT'S AMAZING. Honestly the best thing I have ever tasted. It's now my go-to order whenever I come here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The viet coffee, oolong tea, and black sesame flavours are must-try's. Just wish that they were open all year round..."}
{"text":"Was recommended to this gelato shop by the owner's brother Andrew. We are so glad we did because the gelato was AMAZING! The flavors were strong, and the consistency is just right - creamy, not too icy. My favorite flavor is the oolong tea. I wish there was a kekou in the US so I can go there more often. One of the best gelato places I've been to, and I've had gelato in Italy. This place is definitely up to par."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite gelato place in Toronto! The flavours are so unique! My favourites are the Milk Tea and Viet Coffee. A must try and worth the trip to Baldwin St!"}
{"text":"HK milk tea, viet coffee, oolong tea, spiced pineapple??? green tea whiskey??? BOOM! Kekou offers the most unique (and tasty) flavors I've ever seen. MUST. TRY. THEM. ALL. And the quality is oh soooo awesome. Creamy, yet delicate. Sweet but not too sweet. Simply divine. It's not cheap by any means but DAMN does it make my girlfriend (and me) brimming with happiness from ear to ear.   Best gelato in town? I THINK SO. Come see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place a while ago and I was a little doubtful because I wasn't too sure how these \"asian\" flavors would taste. I went and there were a lot of flavors to try! You're able to taste test flavours, and the server was really nice about it.   I love their different choices of flavors including the whisky green tea, tsing tao peach, vietnamese coffee and hk milk tea.   It was absolutely delicious. I would 100% recommend. I can't wait to try all their flavors.   The only downside is that it is pretty far downtown so I'm not able to visit often.   But nonetheless, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Nothing hits the spot more than a cool treat during a humid, sun filled day of summer. Along Baldwin Street, between McCaul and Beverley, sits a quaint little creamery producing \"Asian Gelato\". Yes, Asian gelato: gelato with Asian inspired flavours! Produced in small batches to ensure freshness and a smooth creamy texture, gelato at Kekou is flavoured with natural ingredients like tea and real fruit juices.  Walking into this little 'shop' felt more like an ice cream parlor than a gelato store. Chalkboard signs out front, benches, string lights, and wooden steps- it was like stepping into someone's home. Kekou's gelato is in metal canisters with lids, similar to how ice cream is scooped from tubs. The light-up board in the back and small tags placed on top of the counters lists all the available flavours they are serving.  Staple flavours like Vietnamese coffee, Red bean, Mango, are some of the most popular, but Kekou also has changing flavours like Pandan, HK Milk Tea, and Whiskey Green Tea. Like every gelato stand, if you can't make up your mind, or are simply curious to try that delicious Durian gelato, samples are of course free. The gelato is served in your choice of cup or two types of cones: plain or seaweed (really nice touch).  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the Avacado Banana and Pandan but that's a personal taste preference. All the flavours taste exactly what they are listed as, after all, the ingredients are natural.  In addition to gelato, there are beverages as well- Coconut water, Vietnamese coffee, Drip coffee. At the end of the day, we're really here for the gelato right?  Overall, Kekou highlights unique asian flavors which are interesting, creative and tasty. Ever since Gelato flavours have gone rogue, weird and strange have become favourable qualities while digging into our prized frozen treat. Kekou certainly does a great job of showcasing different profiles while staying true to real authentic tastes of Asia."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to arrive in Toronto with the first winds of winter, but I had my heart set on getting some uniquely-flavored gelato so dammit, I was going to Kekou. The single employee behind the counter was definitely surprised that I came in on such a cold day, and I was surprised that I was the only person at the time willing to add insult to frostbitten fingers.   As I sampled flavor after flavor, I knew I had made the right decision though. Even reading the menu listings made my heart warm: Red Bean White Chocolate, Oolong Milk Tea, HK Style Milk Tea, Rosewater Pistachio, Vietnamese Coffee, Osmanthus Plum, Whiskey Green Tea, Rum and Condensed Milk, both Peanut Sesame and Black Sesame... I can't even. I mean, how could you not? The server was super friendly and didn't rush me or judge me for trying so many flavors, actually giving me suggestions since I'm so indecisive. I finally settled on a scoop of Rosewater Pistachio and HK Style Milktea - it seems their Oolong is really popular as it was sold out when I arrived. The flavors I sampled were all true to their descriptions and utilized the actual ingredients claimed. As in, there were actual pistachios and I could taste the earthiness of tea.   It's a little pricy, $5 for a double scoop in a cup. But I guess they're unique, and if you want to take advantage of the ample seating and Wi-Fi inside, I suppose it's worth it. They also sell loose leaf tea and a variety of savory buns that I regretfully had to pass on since I had to reserve stomach space for future adventures."}
{"text":"YUKKKKK  grosss! slop on a plate or cone. lol"}
{"text":"Unfortunately they did not have pistachio.  So we sampled Peanut Sesame and HK Milk Tea.  The Peanut Sesame tastes like peanut butter but we couldn't taste the Sesame.  We ended up ordering the HK Milk Tea and it was very flavorful.  We would come again for sure if they had pistachio."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato and many flavours. There are three sizes, each size with an increase in the number of scoops. My favourite is the HK Milk Tea and the black sesame. They let you try free samples of the flavours. Overall, it's quite expensive for a couple of scoops of ice cream but definitely worth it. They also give you a stamp card. If you go buy nine times or something, you get one free. They're closed during the Winter season at this location."}
{"text":"I have been to Kekou two times in the past week and I am on my way to becoming a regular. Each time I go, I try something different and I am never disappointed! The ice cream flavors are creative and awesome! I took the white chocolate last time and it was amazing. There always seems to be a long lineup but it moves pretty fast."}
{"text":"There's icecream and then there's ICECREAM. Kekou has a whole variety of flavors, all elevated to a whole new level. Nothing bad to say about this place except for one thing. Get the Vietnamese coffee flavor gelato. It will not disappoint.   Cheers."}
{"text":"i use to love this place,but i've found their gelato to not be as delicious as it use to. not sure why that is?"}
{"text":"Delicious gelatos! They have popsicles , gelatos and sorbets. It you find yourself in Toronto stop by."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a huge fan of Gelato but Kekou Gelato House has me hooked on a few of their flavours. Some of their Asian inspired flavours are amazing specifically the Durian and Black Sesame flavours. Both are fresh, creamy and so rich in flavour without any taste of artificial flavouring. If your a fan of these flavours, you definitely will love the versions offered by Kekou Gelato House.  I normally get a waffle cone with two scoops ($4.45 plus tax). The waffle cones are offered in original, sesame and seaweed from what I remember. Also, like other posters have mentioned they allow you to sample any flavour before you make a purchase.   FYI: If your going looking for traditional flavours, you probably won't find them since they specialize in mostly Asian inspired flavours."}
{"text":"First time coming, had to see what all the hype was about. I have to admit I was not disappointed. Had a Tsing Dao beer peach and osmanthum plum berry. Both were very refreshing and flavorful sorbets. Definitely among one of the best I've had. Next I will be coming back to try their gelatos!"}
{"text":"I love having dessert here. The ice cream flavours are delicious and the staff are always so friendly. It's become somewhat of a ritual for my boyfriend and I to end our date nights here. I always try a different flavour popsicle because they have so many and I haven't had a bad one yet."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this is the good stuff. The place is fairly small and old looking, but it's a cute stop for you and a date/friend to share some gelato. Realistically, the texture of gelato isn't as creamy as original Italian ones and it's a bit grainy/icy based on the flavours we tried (Chocolate Ginger - personal fave, Rum & Condensed Milk, and Peanut Sesame). BUT, I'm not mad at it - there's actually a small sign explaining why their gelato isn't as creamy.   For $6 for two scoops (they are ok size), its not the cheapest option. BUT, they've got tons of interesting flavours that totally make up the price and adventure of testing out different flavours. You're not going to find your standard vanilla or chocolate here without a bit of a twist to it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are a fan of Kekou Gelato House. I like the unique and interesting flavours that this place provides. He's a huge durian lover and I absolutely can't stand the smell. I would say, the smell and taste of the Durian flavour gelato is really true to how the actual fruit is. Very rare you would get to have such an option in grocery stores/ asian supermarkets. I hate the durian real fruit and therefore, the gelato doesn't make me want to eat it anymore-- but HE LOVES IT! TRY it if you love DURIAN!!  I am a fan of coffee (Anything coffee flavour!!) I'm so used to yummy creamy coffee flavour of Haagen Daaz. I truly enjoy the vietnamese coffee though! Its such a strong smell and full of heavy coffee flavour! we would buy TUBS of this back home to eat!  I also quite like the black sesame! I like the little bits of sesame seeds grinder into the gelato! I like how the sesame flavour is so strong as well. I can't find these flavours in the asian supermarket (they often taste too sweet and creamy).   I also really enjoy the HK MILK tea flavour! Such a unique taste-- as if you're drinking the actual drink!!   Really good place!   Seating: it's busy there but not too bad. At least the store is big enough to find a little bench or table to sit down and enjoy your gelato!"}
{"text":"Their whiskey green tea, rosewater pistachio, and oolong milk tea are to die for! They give unlimited samples and the price is decent and worth it for their unique variety of flavours.   This location is smaller and doesn't have popsicles or soft serve, but I prefer it to the Queen West because the customer service and overall friendliness of the place excels over their other location.  Just make sure you get their stamp card the first time around because you'll definitely be returning there often!"}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, I had yet to find a gelato place that incorporated Asian flavors! I had seen gelato pics from my friend who had HK Milk Tea gelato from this place and I knew I had to check it out! Their menu currently is limited to some flavors and they are expanding the menu to have other items and flavors soon. I got one scoop of HK Milk Tea gelato and it was exactly how I imagined...perfect and authentic. This coming from a HK Milk Tea lover! My second scoop was the Whiskey Green Tea. It has a strong taste of whiskey but nonetheless a nice mix of the two.  I had wanted to try the Rosewater Pistachio by unfortunately they were out.  They let you try samples of the flavors before you commit to a scoop! They have so many unique flavors and combinations. I would love to come back here the next time I visit Toronto. Its a rare find to have a combo of gelato and Asian flavors !"}
{"text":"My favourite is the black sesame!  All the flavours are so distinctive. They taste exactly what they're named - the green tea whiskey, you swear you're a bit drunk after; the spicy mango has a nice kick; the durian luckily has all the flavour without the smell.  Just be careful about eating on their benches as there are a lot of wasps."}
{"text":"I've been hearing that I had to come here (and apparently, that it was a travesty that I had never been before), so our downtown food trip revolved around this one pivotal spot. We came here after our surprise stop at Arctic Bites. I had no idea that Kekou was only a few doors down. Yes, we went to Stay Cafeteria for shaved ice, then Arctic Bites for rolled ice cream, then came here for gelato. It was a hot day, and I would have just loved Kekou for their self-serve water jug and cups, even before their amazing gelato.  I was told I could sample all the flavors. I did not. Too much frozen dessert. I had most of their more unique flavors. My favorites were their roasted oolong milk tea, their HK milk tea, and their durian. Their whiskey green tea was very strong on the whiskey taste. The soursop (my first experience with soursop) was unique, but seriously not my thing. I think I made a funny face after sampling that one. Yeah. They had one with lotus. I thought it was the flower. Turns out it was the seed. Not my thing either. The three of us ended up getting a small of each of the osmanthus plum berry (tart and more like a sorbet than a gelato), the durian (oh so good. So strong of durian. Had durian bits in it), and the HK milk tea (tastes like solid, creamy HK milk tea. Was blown away). For the price of about $3 a small, it was totally worth it. Next time I'm in the area, I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place and I'm one stamp away from getting a free scoop!   This time we got Viet coffee and, my favourite, roasted oolong. Personally, I love the oolong more. It's stronger and has less of an ice taste to it. Viet coffee tasted like a steeped ice cap.   The interior is tiny but honestly everyone sits out in the patio area.   I love that they have a free water station where there's a pitcher and plastic cups in case you don't like the taste in your mouth (cough: durian choosers). I also like that they let you sample a spoonful before buying.   If you have a stamps card, remember to redeem before August 31!!"}
{"text":"They're open again for the season at the Baldwin location, hooray!!! But currently they are on their spring hours, open only 2-10PM, so sadly no post-lunch gelato until summer time for me :'(  I'm a huge fan of Kekou Gelato because their gelatos are house-made and they don't use (m)any additives in their gelato including stabilizers, which unfortunately means the Kekou texture resembles that of ice cream (harder, more rough) more than that of creamy, velvety true Italian gelato. However, the huge range of Asian-inspired flavors make up for this! This season they have 2 new flavors at this site -- almond tofu (highly recommend if you enjoy the taste of sweetened almond milk with a hint of soy) and jasmine tea. Both are non-vegan. Other non-vegan flavors that I recommend are rosewater pistachio, Viet coffee, and green bean whiskey (made with real whiskey).  Yes, they do have a few vegan sorbet flavors here - my fav is the chocolate ginger, but it is very strong and has real bits of ginger, so definitely an acquired taste.   Also ask them for a stamp card - collect stamps for every purchase and redeem a free medium size scoop or drink, etc after a certain # (9 I think?) :)"}
{"text":"I prefer this location to the Queen West one -- less seating, but this location has the OG Kekou feeling to it - or maybe I just like smaller daintier spaces. They don't have soft serve or popsicles at this location, but you really only need gelato if you're making the trip to Kekou :D I ordered durian (don't you dare offer me gum or mints before I'm finished) which can be a little smelly for those who don't appreciate this royal prickly fruit. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been; flavours that are a must try: black sesame, durian, HK milk tea, viet coffee, roasted oolong. If you really love the flavour, you can buy a pint of it to take home! Each scoop is the perfect portion for an after dinner dessert, or a snack if you're just satisfying your sweet tooth, without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Cute place in Baldwin with really great flavours. I tried the HK milk tea and the plum berry gelatos and they were both really good! The staff were friendly and let us try flavours before deciding. Not much sitting room inside, but there are cute benches outside, and Baldwin is a nice area for a stroll. Prices are comparable to other gelaterias, but the flavours stand out. Really liked this place!"}
{"text":"With nearly 300 reviews, there's not much more to say about Kekou that hasn't already been said. I've been here only once, but that's enough for me to give it 5 stars.  It was a warm night and there wasn't much of a line. I walked inside and there were a handful of people walking between the 2 cases of gelato, perplexed about which flavours to choose. Kekou's value prop is to provide a huge selection of uncommon flavours, many of which incorporate Asian ingredients, so it was nice being able to choose between a bunch of flavours I'm not used to seeing in the other gelato shops. I did the same as the others in the store and sampled a few before I settled for a scoop of HK Milk Tea and a scoop of Vietnamese coffee.  It wasn't too difficult of a choice for me, as those are two of my favourite Asian drinks. I couldn't wait to taste what they're like in gelato form. I started by trying a spoonful of each flavour and it didn't take much time to conclude that the flavours were remarkably accurate. Tasted just like the best versions of milk tea and Vietnamese coffee that I remember from my visits to those countries."}
{"text":"We went to Kekou after reading about the founders and their story in the Globe and Mail. Really amazing article. Love the fusion of Asian flavours. We have had the durian, Vietnamese coffee, ginger chocolate, red bean white chocolate and HK milk tea. It is a bit different from traditional Italian gelato but it is every bit as delicious. Very informative posters on the wall about their approach/philosophy on gelato making. I can see they care very much about the tradition and your health."}
{"text":"5 stars for the durian gelato! It was nothing short of eating the real thing - pungent, creamy and delicious. Even if you don't like durian I think you will still be pretty impressed with the creative selection - roasted oolong, Hk milk tea, Tsing Tao peach, Viet coffee, rice wine milk and even spicy salted pineapple (what?). I don't think you can go wrong with any of these. Another thing I loved was the creativity in the waffle cones. There were seasame and even seaweed flavours - we tried both and thumbs up :)  Definitely a great place to have fun trying different options before making a decision - it could be a hard one. We had no shame and asked to try 5+ items each and the staff was still really friendly about it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times already and still haven't had a single bad experience. Very unique flavours that you won't find anywhere else! My favourites are HK Milk Tea, Black Sesame (omg so goodddd), Pistachio Rosewater, Viet Coffee and Oolong Tea. The durian one is pretty good as well if you like it. Definitely recommend visiting this place! They have a punch card too so even more incentive to come back! Haha. The ladies there helping are also very patient so you can taste test some flavours before you commit to getting a full scoop!"}
{"text":"The OG Kekou is still the best one. You can't beat sitting on the wooden benches during a calm evening looking up at the trees and sky. It's very romantic. If someone took me out on a date here I would be impressed."}
{"text":"HK milk tea gelato is wonderful! Lots of asian flavors like black sesame, vietnamese coffee, red bean."}
{"text":"4 stars for the impressive menu, you will find flavours here that you cannot find anywhere else! The tastes (creaminess, etc.) are well balanced but not out of this world.   5 stars is for their employee's family and friend card. I got a lot of free ice cream so no complaints. Go befriend an employee, they get a lot of ice cream!"}
{"text":"Usually not a big fan of sweets, but this place is something. This was our last stop to a self-made Toronto food crawl. Hidden near UofT campus, this gelato place offers various funky and interesting flavors, which some are a mix of alcohol too!  I took the HK milk tea flavor, just because I like milk tea. I was not disapointed. What is good also is that you can get to try the flavors before settling to one. Will definitively come back when I'll be back in Toronto.   A perfect stop during hot days of summer!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of flavours of gelato. From the classic chocolate to some unusual combo you never see in other gelato shop. I chose yogurt and it is very refreshing and not too sweet. Price is reasonable and I wish I live near the shop so I can apply their membership card and come everyday."}
{"text":"Some unique gelato flavours like vietnamese coffee, black sesame and chocolate wasabi. Unfortunately had a lot of flavours that were out of stock during my visit. The small sizes were really generous and they had complimentary tea and cider. Overall, a solid place for dessert with a unique asian twist."}
{"text":"Great gelato, great service. There was a line-up even before it opened up at 3:30pm.  They're okay with you trying a few flavours before deciding on your 2 or 3 flavours. Tried the durian, and while I'm a fan of eating real durian, the smell/taste of the durian gelato was very, very strong. So if you're not a fan of durian, don't go for it! Had the black sesame and HK style milk tea, both of which were very flavourful!  There's like a dozen or so flavours that regularly change, but do be careful if you have any allergies though. Only thing is that they should be open more hours each day!"}
{"text":"Awe one of my favorite pocket neighborhoods in the city, Baldwin Village! Thankfully, the newly opened Kekou has brought a chic ice cream parlor serving up some interesting flavors to this who're in search beyond those average Joe vanilla, strawberry and chocolate flavors. For some reason I decided to try their odd combination flavor of avocado and banana, which to my surprise was really good. You either love it or hate it.  J had the oolong tea flavor which was light and lovely.  The range of flavors is awesome, the venue is clean and aside from ice cream they also serve some warm teas. Great addition to Baldwin Village! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends after having dinner at Platito. We originally wanted to go to Arctic Bites, but because it was closed, stopped here. There is a lot of bench seating outside of the location which is nice! I tried the Black Sesame flavour, which was delicious.   I've also been to the location on Queen West. I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Kekou, but when I'm in the area, I would definitely grab a scoop!"}
{"text":"With Kekou, Toronto *finally* got a place that's on a world-class level (sorry to all the other lovely gelato joints in the city, but they just don't compare to the level of gelato you will find in other city centres around the globe). Kekou offers a roster of flavours for different palettes,  with an East Asian flair. They achieve robust flavours, made with quality ingredients, and the service is excellent. Over the course of a couple of visits I tried most of the gelatos, but the standouts included Hong Kong Milk Tea (fantastic!), Pistachio Rose Water, Black Sesame (not my taste but excellently made), and Peanut Sesame (great balance between the two flavours). Some flavours were well-rendered, but they just didn't work together. For instance, the Whiskey Green Tea delivers on both of the flavours, but they don't work together: an early milky sweetness with a strong punch of whiskey gives way to the subtler green tea that feels bitter in comparison. The experience is more like having a shot of whiskey and a chaser of tea, than the spiked iced-tea drink that the flavour wants to evoke. Only one flavour among those I tried was a big miss: the Red Bean White Chocolate, which is not on par with any of the others. I didn't try any of the sorbets, but they look great. The staff let you try many flavours, but holding up the line is just bad etiquette. Kekou's gelato makers choose not to use stabilizers (among other additives), which typically help lend gelato its creamy smoothness. Yes, this does somewhat affect the texture of their gelato. Although I don't agree with their claim that all contemporary stabilizers are chemically troubling (or their account of stabilizers as a 21st-century shortcut), I respect their philosophy. In any case, most flavours still delivered a smooth texture. I also think the texture could be further improved by changing the serving technique, like using the paddle instead of the ice-cream scoop. It's not as pretty, but it's a better texture. The only thing that disappoints me about Kekou (not enough to give them anything less than five stars) is that you cannot get more than one flavour in a small cup. A small serving (which is a sizeable scoop) is as much gelato as I want in one go, but it means committing to only one flavour and having a lot of it. I would really appreciate breaking the single serving up into two flavours, even if it means a small surcharge. I suspect this is another byproduct of using a scoop, which makes split servings difficult."}
{"text":"People come to Kekou Gelato in droves for their Asian flavours in frozen bites in the midst of downtown Toronto that taste so fucking fresh you'd think you are actually eating a mango, or sipping on HK milk tea, or a bite of durian even (it's pretty good).  But for 2015 they have outdone themselves by offering alcohol-flavoured gelato flavours. Now I have tried beer-flavoured things and they usually disappoint with artificial flatness. But not at Kekou. You ask for Tsingtao peach, and you'll get a fucking scoop of Tsingtao peach, and it will fucking taste like proper beer and peach. Peach flavoured/infused beer? It actually has a fizzy soda texture that unfolds as each bite melts in your mouth.  There is also whiskey green tea, which does reek of whiskey, with hints of matcha. True to their business model where they make everything fresh daily using said ingredients, actual alcoholic beverages are used in producing these new flavours. They actually ask you if it is okay that there's alcohol in the gelato (good to know if you avoid alcohol, or Muslim or what-have-you). The buzzy flavours are not that strong (it's not like they pour a shot of the stuff in every scoop), but noticeable enough to say that when they say it's beer or whiskey or rice wine flavoured, they mean it.  Alcoholic or not, no matter what you pick, Kekou will get you drunk with happiness on a stinkin sweaty hot summer Toronto day."}
{"text":"They have a variety of flavours to choose from and you are able to ask for the sample! I had the HK milk tea and Durian and this was about $8.5 (after tax). The tea flavour was so strong and so does the durian one! They also offer take out gelato box! I'll definitely go back and bring more friends there!"}
{"text":"When Asian flavors meet Italian ice cream, you get Kekou Gelato. Very difficult to choose what flavor(s) to get but the staff is very accommodating and will let you sample whatever you'd like and do so with a smile. I've been to many similar places that seem a little stingy with their samples. Not the case at Kekou.  I ended up getting a scoop of rice wine milk and a scoop of osmantus plum berry. I don't even know what either is really but they pleased my tastebuds. I liked how the fruitiness of the plum berry mixed with the creaminess of the rice wine milk.  Good combo!    It's a little bit of a stroll through a residential area to get there from Chinatown but not too bad. Indoor and outdoor seating, so you can enjoy gelato regardless of the weather.  Flavors change according to what fruits are in season so they give you plenty of reasons to come back and have a loyalty card to reward you."}
{"text":"If I'm feeling like having something creamy, I default to pistachio or durian gelato (I know, I know... you either hate it or love it), but my favourite flavour is Jasmine milk tea.   Kekou has the best asian flavours under one roof like thai milk tea, HK milk tea, vietnamese coffee... mmm."}
{"text":"JUST GOOOOOO if you love Asian desserts and flavours...... think Asian dessert in ice cream / gelato form - no joke!  I'm so glad that summer decide to come back for a second run because the last few weeks has been way to cold and windy and the last thing I wanted was something cold and frosty. But today was beautiful, sunny and I was excited to be heading to Kensington in search for some KEKOU!  ....guess everyone was thinking the same thing on one of the last warm days as a line up had already formed at the gelato house when we walked in. There were definitely a few flavours I was curious about (Pandan, Soursop) and a few that I was instantly attracted to (Black Sesame, Red Bean White Chocolate, Vietnamese Coffee). I got a sample of the Pandan which I was told is similar to the lotus leaf - very earthy and refreshing, and vietnamese coffee, strong and intense just like I expected.  I knew for sure I was going to order Black Sesame but needed something else. While I am a red bean lover, I didn't feel like chocolate today (it was  Red Bean White Chocolate flavour). At the last moment,  I decided to go with my gut and get the HK Milk Tea - and boy was I glad I did!  The Milk Tea was fullllll of flavour, exactly like a regular cup in a Chinese Diner... creamy and full of aroma, it was SOOOO DELISH! The sesame did not disappoint either with bits of sesame in every bite. Not too sweet and yet made of the real deal.. The winner by a smidget was the Milk Tea though... I really could have had that by it self. I tried \"his\" Green Bean Coconut Gelato and it was as authentic as can be with bits of green been to compliment the aromatic coconut flavours.  For $3.75 for a small cup, it is really a steal. I would compare it to the best Gelateria's - like Bella in the heart of Vancouver that charges $5.50 - 6.00 for the same size. Nothing really compares to this and if you really want to try what Durian tastes like I suggest you give this a try,  Summer - please don't leave yet... I want to come back before winter comes."}
{"text":"Workers were really nice and encouraged to sample the flavours before ordering. Had the rice wine milk and the roasted oolong tea. It was really tasty and relaxing to eat outside on the benches."}
{"text":"with all the ice cream places popping up in Toronto, how does one distinguish oneself? asian inspired flavours!  I randomly stopped into kekou while on the way to go grocery shopping, and had no idea what to expect. at first, I thought it was just an ice cream place, but when I began to read the flavours, I relalized that they all seemd uniquely asian. spciy salted pineapple? milk tea? vietnamese coffee? durian??!?!? so many flavours, and so little time.  after trying nearly half of all the flavours, I have to say my favourites are durian (if you can handle it), and the spicy salted pineapple. Classic flavours like taro, or green tea are good as well if you don't want anything too weird. I brought my mother in law here and she got one of the ice cream bars that was really good too. I always just got the ice cream, but I'll be getting a bar next time as well.  Kekou is perfect for someone like myself. I find most western desserts much too sweet or too creamy. if you're looking for sweet creamy gelato, this isn't the place for you. and if you're looking for ice ceam drizzled in chocolate, with pieces of oreos and brownies stuffed in it, then this is also not for you. but, if you're looking for a cold refreshing dessert with some classic asian flavours, then it's worth a stop in."}
{"text":"On our way back to the hotel, we stopped at Kekou Gelato House for a refreshing snack.   They featured the following dairy flavors: Vietnamese Coffee, Hong Kong Milk Tea, Greenbean Coconut, Red Bean White Chocolate, Durian, Rosewater Pistachio, Rum and Condensed Milk, Black Sesame, Peanut Sesame, Whiskey Green Tea, Avocado Banana, and Roasted Oolong Milk Tea; and the following non-dairy flavors: Chocolate Ginger, Osmanthus Plumberry, Spicy Salted Pineapple, Mango, and Soursop.   After sampling a few flavors, my mom ordered the Mango while I ordered the Roasted Oolong Milk Tea!"}
{"text":"Awesome flavours, really shine through and taste natural, not artificial. wonder how they do it. Not too sweet or too rich either. Tried lychee strawberry, red bean, green bean, all superb."}
{"text":"Go here and don't think twice. Awesome and creative flavour combinations combined with really friendly service make kekou my new favourite gelato place! They encourage you to taste so many different flavours. I had peanut sesame and viet coffee but you really can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Best gelato I've ever had. This place has amazing flavor combinations, done so well! I would highly recommend this shop to anyone wanting something fun and delicious for dessert"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my coworkers. best asian gelato! they have many flavors and very friendly service.."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem that's located on the corner of Baldwin and McCaul is really something I tell ya.   There's a wide variety of asian flavoured gelato to choose from and they're always coming up with new ones.   My friend took me here for the first time and I instantly fell in love with this little gelato house. Ed's is where I usually get the standard gelato flavours that pack a punch but the fact that this place offers gelato with asian flavours is great and unique!  I've tried the vietnamese coffee and the purple yam and were both good. The sweet level wasn't too overwhelming, it was just right.  I'll definitely be back to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"My goal was to try the durian gelato. Upon entering the store there's this smell that reminds me of home (Malaysia where durian is our national fruit). I don't know why durian is often described for smelling like hell but it smells and tastes like heaven to me. Anyway, back to reviewing gelato. I knew I was getting durian for sure but I tried black sesame and Vietnamese coffee. I found black sesame would be too sweet to pair with durian so I picked Vietnamese coffee. I told the server what I wanted and she asked if I wanna try before \"making such a drastic and bold choice\". Lol.   Duran gelato didn't disappoint at all. It's creamy and pungent - HEAVEN! I wished I picked two scoops of the same flavour. I bet it tastes better than buying those frozen durian from Chinatown.   I would definitely return for more durian gelato and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I had read good things about this place. Really, really good things. Good, beautiful ice cream made with real ingredients, and interesting Asian inspired flavours. We adore Wong's Ice Cream in the East end near Broadview, so my 10 year old was eager to try this. The flavours seem to be pretty good, but the whole pay first order after thing is off putting. Additionally, I found the attitude of the person working there to be off putting. Finally, the poor customer service is off-putting. So, the ice cream is the best thing about this place, but there is no way we'll be back. We'd rather go somewhere where the ice cream is amazing and we're treated like our patronage is of value."}
{"text":"A simple shop serving gelato and sweet drinks. There are many options for gelato flavors (around 15). The employees kindly let you try free samples of the flavours, though one employee I encountered looked super bored and disgruntled.  The gelato tastes fine according to my expectation, nothing special to say (whether good or bad). It's nice that the shop serves free water to balance out the sweetness.  The interior decor is unfortunate. The menu signage looks ugly. The interior is a drab white, and a lot of floor space is left open with no tables or anything. I'm not upset about it or anything, but factually speaking, the appearance is below average out of all the dessert shops I've been to."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Creative flavors that taste exactly as described so there's no surprises! The only surprise is how amazing their gelato tastes!   They use Italian methods of making perfect gelato but incorporate Asian flavors! Their milk tea, Viet coffee and sesame are my personal favorites. And if you enjoy the spiky durian, you'd love their durian flavor. It's tastes even better than durian!!   I often but the points for take out. They pack... And I need really really PACK the gelato into foam containers so the gelato won't melt for up to 45 minutes. I bring a cooler full of ice with me just in case. Also, be sure to grab a stamp card! Buy enough and you can get a free gelato next time!   ***they do close for the winter and open up again in the spring.**"}
{"text":"Seriously loving this place. Go try! The staff was friendly and did not hesitate to let us sample almost everything in the store.   Me and my partner had black sesame viet coffee durian. I would like to have mango next time. All the flavours are real- so powder here. It's cool that they make their own at the back of the store.  The store is not very big but they offer a place to seat for two to four. Go! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Love the gelato flavours from here! They have a unique combination of flavours, which is what makes Kekou unique. My favourite is Hong Kong milk tea.  My only complaint is that it's not opened year round and that the shop opens only in the afternoon. Otherwise, the shop is very cosy and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Really awesome gelato :) My favourite flavours are the earl grey and vietnamese coffee. You can sample as many flavours you like before deciding."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly and let you taste any flavours that you want. My favorite was the Hong Kong milk tea and roasted oolong. I also adore the guava plum salt flavour but it has been discontinued for now :("}
{"text":"Hong Kong Milk Tea Gelato?? YES PLEASE!  This place has superb gelato with unique asian-inspired flavours. Spicy Mango, Peanut Sesame, Thai Iced Tea, just to name a few.They also have a cute seating area on the patio - great for couples and friends!"}
{"text":"They are closed until next spring. So I go the other location. I love this ice cream;)"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best gelato shops around.  Notwithstanding the asian flavours, just understanding their care and rationale for making small batches and using zero stabilitizers makes it great.  I love the Viet Coffee flavour. Every flavour there is completely true to it's taste.  This is a must try place and also is well priced. You can definitely sample, just don't hold up the line too long!"}
{"text":"On a hot, summer day, what do we want? GELATO! When do we want it? NOW! Where do we want it from? KEKOU GELATO HOUSE!  Now that I've gotten that out of my system. I came here tonight on a whim, the weather was warmer than my liking and I had been eyeing this place on Baldwin St. as a place to 'beat the heat'. When you walk in this place, some features resemble other gelato places in the city but their eclectic offerings set them apart. Tonight, I was slightly cowardly when initially walking in not sure of what flavor would taste good to me. Those fears were quickly squashed when I had a spoonful of their redbean white chocolate, heavenly! Truthfully, I can't really describe the taste but it grows on you very quickly. To supplement it, I also got some strawberry lychee gelato which complemented the other nicely.  Overall, I was impressed by my experience. They have the store organized in a manner that you are moved through quickly and efficiently. They do not have any tables only a few scattered benches; therefore, if you are looking to sit and enjoy your gelato, be mindful, seating is at a premium."}
{"text":"MUST-TRY. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.   Amazing! They have a great selection of unique gelato flavours ranging from rum condensed milk to whiskey green tea.   I have tried the red bean white chocolate which was phenomenal and the hong kong milk tea which was again, outstanding. Today, I had the Vietnamese Coffee. I'm not usually a coffee enthusiast but I'll make an exception for this one! I have never been to such a unique gelato house before!   There are two small tables inside and some seats outside to sit at. They provide samples to help you make your decision.   I got both ice creams in a sugar cone which was delicious.   Will definitely come back!!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Hello Yelp, my name is Dan and I am a Kekou addict.  Last year when they first opened, I think I visited this place every day during opening week. That was a great summer for feeding my gelato addiction.  Their closure in the winter months allowed me to seek help for my illness. But now that it's warm again, I've relapsed with abandon!  As someone who is pretty decent at making his own ice cream, I can say that the product Kekou puts out is top-shelf stuff - no preservatives and all natural flavours that you can really appreciate. You can really taste the effort they put into perfecting their craft. Throw in a their super-awesome staff and you have yourself a winner!  Brought some relatives from NYC to try this place out and they all agreed that it was the best gelato they'd ever had!***  So get off Yelp and get your Kekou on already!  Some of standout flavours: - Vietnamese Coffee (this is staple for me, it's almost always 1 of the 2 flavours I get). Tastes just like the drink. - Black Sesame: You can tell it's made from scratch. It's ever so slightly grainy so you have a nice texture and the flavour is just the right intensity. - Peanut Sesame: Tastes like a more mild peanut butter, more emphasis on the peanut, less on the butter - Whisky Green Tea: Just do it, the name sells itself - Jasmine Tea: Haven't seen this on the menu for a while, but it tastes like a nice strong cup of tea... but in gelato form.  Noteworthy:  - Spicy Mango - Vanilla Lotus - Red Bean Vanilla: I'm not a fan of red bean dessert, but this flavour strikes the perfect balance for me.  ***Asian gelato flavouring may or may not induce slight biasing amongst Asian relatives"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. This was really close to \"ma la express\", which is where I wrote another Yelp review. I was here after my lunch to get some dessert. It was a good choice.   Sometimes it's hard to judge a gelato or ice cream place because they kind of all taste the same. Sorry let me take that back, they all taste the same when it's homemade (and obviously, they know what they're doing).   When I first went in, I was greeted by the staff. I guess because of the recent hype surrounding this place there were other couples and people there waiting to try their gelato and sorbet as well. Yes that's right, they have gelato AND sorbet. The sorbet is usually saved for the fruit flavoured ones. I ended up getting a small cup with two flavours, Vietnamese coffee and something coconut.   The gelato was good to say the least. I think the flavour could have been more concentrated but my opinion could be biased because I had a numb tongue from all the spicy food I had during lunch and I also have a high tolerance for sweets. I forgot to mention that their most popular gelato is Vietnamese coffee.   Their gelato is not just sweet. It has flavour, real flavour. The coffee is not just sugar and the coconut is not just artificial. You actually get the full sensation and taste of coffee and you actually get the flavour of fresh coconut (with actual pieces of coconut inside I think). I would recommended trying the Vietnamese coffee flavour if it's your first time there. Obviously I wish the flavour could've been more concentrated but that's just my personal preference.   Lastly, i want to talk about the price. It was fine, not too expensive, but definitely not cheap. I think I would choose kékou over marble slab. I KNOW ice cream and gelato aren't the same thing, I just said that because I prefer gelato over ice cream. Saves a few calories and bucks too.   Baldwin village itself is quite the treat on your day off people!"}
{"text":"An excellent place with good value for money. I tried the whiskey green tea which I have to say tastes exactly like what one would expect from a name like that. Red bean white chocolate was a little difficult to discern flavours but good nevertheless. Will definitely return for additional flavours!!"}
{"text":"For someone who cannot have dairy, Kekou provides delicious and creative flavors for sorbets. I have visited often but on my visit today, I tried the sour sop and mango flavour. Both flavour had a real fruit taste without alot of sugar. It almost felt like a healthy snack! I later googled them and saw on their website that they create their sorbets with fruit, spring water and honey. I love how they use honey! The store has lots of dairy options and do not use stabilizers in creating their gelato.  Whether you are craving for a fruit flavor or a tea fan, they have something for you. Flavors change weekly however I find that it always gives you something new to try. Prices are reasonable, at $3.95 for a small where you can put two flavours, you can't go wrong! Staff are friendly, they do open late and lines moves quickly. They also have a nice seating area in the front and they just introduced a rewards card. I am lucky that I work close by as I will be back again before the summer season is over and they shut down for the winter :("}
{"text":"Had some great sorbet! Other than that the flavors were really weird. Was expecting some common name for Some of their other stuff. (Vanilla , chocolate , strawberry , etc."}
{"text":"Got the vietnamese coffee and durian gelato on my first visit. Definitely exceeded my expectations with the great taste and texture. The durian gelato tasted exactly like durian, but creamier and lighter as a gelato. The vietnamese coffee was also very well flavored and strong.   You can get a sample of whichever you're interested in before you buy! I'd like to try the green bean coconut and black sesame next time.  Would recommend to anyone in the area on a hot day."}
{"text":"My favourite gelato parlour in the city. All the flavours are unique and freshly made each day. This ensures that I come back again and again throughout the summer. I'm always spoiled for choice, trying out several new flavours each time I'm here and finding new favourites. I like the milk tea or coffee flavours as a staple and recently discovered the spicy pineapple as a new contender. It's light and fresh with an unexpected kick of spice at the end. A great opposite to the creamier gelatos that I prefer.  There are several benches outside for seating or just hang out on the steps of the house when it gets busy. A lovely place on a summer day when you need a gelato treat."}
{"text":"Definitely best gelato I've had. Tried a few flavours before settling with vietnamese coffee and durian. All the flavours I tasted were intense. Tsingtao peach really tasted like beer with peach. Whiskey green tea has the smokiness and bite of whiskey. Durian doesn't wreak so much of the offensive smell, but the gelato tasted like a creamy frozen durian. The viet coffee brought be back to Vietnam. Definitely awesome."}
{"text":"Yum! Had Rum with Condensed Milk and Sesame gelato. I tried Avocado Banana as well. There were so many flavours ...I would have tried all but, of course, No can do. Sigh!  Will go back for more...Please feel free to share your favourites. Btw they are reasonable priced as well. Good service too.  August 13, 2016  This time I had Peanut Sesame and Red Bean White Chocolate. Loved Red Bean. Peanut Sesame was good too. I also tasted Spicy Pineapple which would be good for a summer day. Also had my friend's Chocolate Ginger :) which was good at first but then the spice kicked in and the flavour became overwhelming. It is more a winter-flavour.  October 2016  I had the Rosewater Pistachio. Yum! The Queen street location is great. It has condensed flavoured milk. Going to go back when it gets cold."}
{"text":"The gelato flavors are simply phenomenal. Highly recommend the HK milk tea and black sesame. The staff allow you to sample a few flavors being buying. I loved how there was a pitcher of water to cleanse your pallet. Would come back again and try all the other flavors!   The store front is also really cute and is unique. A few benches out front otherwise your eating it on the go which isnt hard to do since it taste so good! ***** stars."}
{"text":"They have the best gelato flavours! Love going there during summer. Some of my faves are: black sesame, HK milk tea, and peanut sesame"}
{"text":"It's an interesting alternative to ice cream and gelato. I liked it but didn't love the flavours."}
{"text":"This was a great surprise! A friend recommended it and I decided to check it out. Unlike busier shops where you are only allowed to try 2 flavours max, you're allowed to try as many as you want! At the end we decided to go with the Tsing Tao Peach, HK Milk Tea, Spicy Salty Pineapple, and Roasted Oolong Tea but they were all soo good! I'll come back and try more gelato flavours for sure."}
{"text":"Kekou continues to be one of my favourite gelato places downtown because of its rich, great tasting gelato flavours.  This location is small than the Queen/Spadina location, but it has pretty much all the gelato flavours. However, you will not find solf serve or popcicle bars around here. They have tables inside the store which is air conditioned, or you can opt to sit outside at their patio space.   In terms of flavours I really like their Rosewater Pistachio, Durian, HK Milk Tea, and Vietnamese Coffee. I got 1 scoop with sugar cone today and it ended up being about $4.10 after tax. The waffle cone is $0.65 extra, and 2 scoop is $7.35 I believe.   You do have to pay first to sample the flavours, but they are all so good I always have trouble deciding!"}
{"text":"So many interesting flavours to choose from it's hard to restrict yourself to 1 or 3! From sorbet to vegan scoops, they had different sorts of flavours like black sesame, milk tea and rum! I'd say there were about 20 flavours to pick from and had popsicles for you to take to the streets! Granted, the flavours fit their description and taste just like their names so it's an exciting and unique experience. Small cafe area for you to sit and enjoy your ice cream in the blazing hot heat heheheh"}
{"text":"I love the concept of Kekou Gelato House - Asian Gelato, with super unique flavours. I booked it down to Kekou on my dinner break one evening since it's not too far from my work.   The service is super friendly, and you can sample some of the flavours if you are undecided. There's not much space inside, but some benches outside for you to chill and enjoy your frozen treat.  I was dead-set on trying the white chocolate red bean gelato, but they were out when I went. Noooo - heartbreak. I ended up trying the Vietnamese Coffee and the Vanilla Lotus Seed. While Kekou definitely sets itself apart from other gelato places flavor wise, I'm just not sold on the texture from the Gelato here. Vanilla Lotus Seed tasted a bit too frozen and not very smooth - like Amanda M. mentions in her review, it was more like eating a crushed ice pop rather than smooth gelato. It reminded me of how ice cream tasted when it gets freezer burnt. The flavor in the Vanilla Lotus Seed was okay, I wouldn't order it twice.  While the Vietnamese Coffee had a great flavor, and the texture was smoother, it was still a bit icy.  I've read from some reviews that the gelato here has been smooth - so maybe I just came on an off night. I will definitely be back to try more flavours - like the coveted Red Bean White Chocolate!"}
{"text":"If you're craving gelato amongst Toronto humidity, this is the place to go! Stopped by here after dinner for dessert with friends. The flavour I tried was almond tofu - which was basically almond ice cream with a hint of tofu flavour. One scoop in a cup was $3.50, and it was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!   There are lots of other unique flavours to choose from - including HK milk tea, pistachio rosewater, oolong tea, green tea whiskey, etc - which I would also recommend (tried my friends').   One thing to note: there were no vegan/dairy free options available at the time but they did say they would make the option available soon, so hopefully that will be in place soon as sometimes dairy can get me and I would love to have the option of choosing coconut milk based ice cream instead."}
{"text":"If you love Asian inspired gelato, this is the place to go!  I tried the Hong Kong milk tea, Vietnamese coffee and durian and it is mouth-watering.  You can really taste the flavour of the gelato.    They also have a stamp card so if you get nine gelatos you'll get one free."}
{"text":"Came back here a few weekends after my first visit and MAN it was busy! We got there 5 minutes before it opened and there was already a group waiting outside.   Ended up getting the durian gelato, HK milk tea and Vietnamese coffee. The Viet coffee was so rich and yummy! The HK milk tea wasn't bad but the flavour wasn't intense/strong enough for me so I don't think I'll get it again. Ended up bringing a tub back home though :D ! ( BTW, you can split the tub into two flavours!)"}
{"text":"Checked this new \"asian style\" gelateria out yesterday with some friends from Rome in tow -- it met with great and enthusiastic approval.  Incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff, and the product is really top notch.  We tried a dozen samples then settled on peanut sesame, avocado banana, guava salt, and a wonderfully fiery hot \"Ginger Milk.\"  If I had to be critical I'd say that while the flavours rock the textures are a wee bit off for what I look for in gelato -- that is, could be a bit smoother and creamier.  Maybe this is why the avocado banana was such a hit.  In any case, a great new addition to the Toronto gelaterie scene"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato in very creative flavors. The price is right for the quality. Service was excellent (trial was offered for as many tastes as I wanted before ordering).  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed everytime I've come here! Ok, I've only just learned about this place so really I've only been here twice, but each time it's packed. I love their flavours. I used to have to make these flavors at home. But now that there's a ice shop that gets me, I am a fan and project that I will be packing on lots of weight thanks to them! I always get the durian because I love durian, but their other ones are good too. Black sesame is awesome. Soursop is delicious. Avocado-banana, I'm still trying to come up with a judgement on, but hey, it's different and that's a good quality!"}
{"text":"Best gelato I've had in the city. Kekou serves interesting flavours with an emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients. I had the avocado banana and HK milk tea, definitely an instant fave."}
{"text":"Even on a cool fall evening, this place does steady business. I can't say I am too surprised, since Kekou offers something different from other gelato places in and around the city.  I've been here a few times already and their gelato is pretty kick-ass awesome. The best thing is that you can sample the flavors until you can decide on at least two flavors to chow down on. Both the small and medium lets select two flavors off their daily menu.   I've really enjoyed the sesame gelato, which I can't miss when I am there for gelato. I've also tried their Hong Kong Milk Tea and their Thai Ice tea, but I find that the Thai Iced tea was a little sweeter and had a bit more flavor impact than the Hong Kong Milk Tea.  Crowds, well it's popular because it's so good, but Kekou knows how to manage their crowds with ample staff and you're never left alone for very long without a sample to nibble on while you try and make a decision. The staff is pretty patient while you sample your flavors of choice.   While there isn't a lot of seating, there is just enough seats to plunk yourself down and enjoy some gelato to share with friends outside on a nice night or along the bench near the front of the store.  Cool notes :  The flavour tags have icons on them, one heart and one ninja dude, tells you which gelato master at Kekou made your flavour.  They have two business stamp cards, make sure you pick up the correct one - since one is their gelato card and the other is their coffee card.  They, also, close during the winter (like around late November)  months and reopen in the spring."}
{"text":"While I barely did any research for my two days in Toronto (bless having friends in town), I randomly found a photo on Insta that instantly had me sold. Gelato made fresh, in-house Asian style? Hell yeaaaaah. Even more props to Kekou as everything they do is based on freshness. No preservatives, stabilizers or filler. You can read more on about that on their website here.  There are a couple benches outside to enjoy your gelato but most people were eating inside to keep cool and prevent their scoops from melting. Their flavours are constantly changing based on the season and availability but there were plenty to choose from when I was there. I tried a couple samples as there were so many interesting flavour combinations (spicy salted pineapple, avocado banana) but ended up going with a medium (two scoops).  - Osmanthus plumberry and HK milk tea ($5.00) - the osmanthus plumberry was incredibly refreshing. Not too sweet but had a great balance of sour and salty. The HK milk tea tasted just like the real thing. Both were terrific but if I had to choose one over the other, I'd get the plumberry again.  Loved Kekou! I would easily come back here multiple times to try all their other unique flavours."}
{"text":"It's great! While it's the first location of their shop, it's not the flagship anymore. The Queen one is much bigger and has more selection. This shop ONLY has the gelato and sorbetto flavours (which are amazing). Have tasted nearly all of them since they let you sample all the cool flavours. Favourites are spicy salted pineapple and chocolate ginger. They also have durian, but that stinks toooooo much, and doesn't taste fantastic in my opinion, but hey, to each their own.  There's also no AC in the shop so sitting outside is the thing to do. They also have pitchers of ice water and cups for customers to sip while they decide what they want."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening on a weekday during the summer. It was quite busy, with lots of students and young'ins, but the line moved quickly.  They have a nice mix of traditional and more unique flavours, and you are able to try a couple to see if they're the ones for you. Ice cream is super smooth and tasty! I got Vietnamese coffee and my friend got banana, both were excellent  This place is a little pricey (though \"gourmet foods\" usually are), but I would definitely go back to try more flavours (who doesn't love ice cream?)"}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the array of unusual flavours here! Trust me they are all worth trying despite how aberrant some of them may be from your typical gelato flavours. All of the flavours are made using Fresh fruit in house and you can really taste the difference. [ everything is also preservative and additive FREE]  Top picks: Red Bean White Chocolate [love, love, love] Green Bean Coconut Spicy Mango [their regular Mango is also really good!] Peanut Sesame Black Sesame Sticky rice pudding [so good! but not always available] You can also ask them for an extra sprinkling of roasted peanuts or sesame seeds on top of your gelato for free :)  Prices are around: Small $3.50, Medium $4.00, Large $4.50 + tax  [ if I remember correctly]  -Waffle cones are also available -They do also sell bigger take home containers which I haven't bought as I felt they were too pricy for the quantity. -They have a stamp card so your 10th visit is free!  Unfortunately Kekou is only open during the Summer months so I would pop in sometime soon before they close for the year!"}
{"text":"I feel a deep sadness for anyone who has not tried this gelato place yet. I love this restaurant so much that I am willing to overlook all its faults (tiny, overly-warm and super crowded) because it is simply... delicious.   And addicting.   Kekou Gelato House is nestled amongst other food-related \"stuff\" like cafes and restaurants. Christmas lights are draped outside from one end to the other, hanging over long, wooden benches. No matter what the weather is like, there are people milling about, happily scooping out ice cream with their brightly coloured spoons. Upon entering I get a blast of warmth, which undoubtedly feels comforting in the winter but unbearable in the summer. The menu is supposed to be \"Asian-inspired\", including flavours such as durian and Tsing Tao Plum.   When you pick your cup size for your ice cream, the \"small\" and \"medium\" size can hold 2 flavours, but the \"large\" size offers you up to 3 flavours if requested. They let you try out samples before ordering, and it's usually a quick procession to the cashier despite the lineups. It's definitely tastier if you eat outside, and there's a lot more space too!  The fruit and tea flavours are mixed better than the other options in my opinion. The sweetness is very balanced and not overwhelming, while the texture is quite smooth to the tongue. Their sorbets are scrumptious as well! Kekou's uses a \"traditional custard base, which [they] age and pasteurize in house for 10-12 hours\" (taken from their website), thus combining the ingredients naturally. They have quickly become my dealer in all things sugary. I love it here!   The best part, of course, is their stamp card. After you collect 9 stamps, you can receive a free medium-sized cup of gelato or sorbet! I am personally insulted that not enough places have this stamp system yet. Free food is the perfect way to encourage people to do anything."}
{"text":"My fav place!!  I always come here when I'm in the area, and also make a detour when I'm not :D   My favourite flavour is black sesame, but I've tried so many others and none had disappointed.  If you are having a hard time choosing, ask to sample flavours!  Also, since I know you'll be returning, get a stamp card ;)"}
{"text":"It's so hard to choose flavours when everything is delicious! We sampled a couple flavours to help us decide but that made choosing even more challenging. A sure sign that many visits to this unique gelato shoppe are in order! The girls who work there are sweet and have a good sense of humour. Try everything!! :)"}
{"text":"Came here right before winter hit, mhmmmmmm.  The flavours are hard to find anywhere else.  The actual place is very small but has a cozy couch for you to sit down if you came at a wintry time.  It's closed as of December since gelato isn't exactly your winter dessert :P  But the flavours Kekou offered were so ridiculously unique and I'd recommend you to come try in the summer :3  We had the small with two scoops of two flavours each, and we tried: whiskey green tea (I tasted the whiskey more than the green tea), HK milk tea (my FAVE, this was amazing), red bean (standard), and Vietnamese coffee (tasted like coffee, but I liked it!)  I think those were the most unique flavours on the menu, but I'm sure their other flavours are just as delicious :)  It's near Kinton Ramen on Baldwin, worth a try (:"}
{"text":"The flavours here are on point! I love that they offer non-traditional gelato flavours at Kekou.   There's creamy and non-creamy gelato options available. For the price, it's totally worth it because 1 scoop of gelato is HUGE - it's filled right up to the brim in a perfectly cute, round scoop. I had a scoop of soursop (non-cream) and it was wonderful! It's got a lychee-pineappley flavour which is super refreshing (even on a cold winter day!). Also tried the Vietnamese coffee flavour, it tasted exactlyyyyy like Viet coffee!   This location has a decent amount of seats. There's a couple tables at the front and several more tables at the back of the store.   As others have mentioned, you'll have to make a purchase first before you are able to sample their flavours. But regardless, you'll definitely want to buy at least 1 scoop while you're here anyways. YUM.  They also accept credit card here too fyi."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite gelato place! If you haven't checked this place out... it's a must!  There's a lot of unique Asian inspired gelato flavours. If you're unsure, always taste test them out! Service is friendly too.  I'm not a big fan of durian but my cousin is, and he loves durian flavoured gelato here. Personally I love the almond tofu, since it's light and refreshing, and the rum with condensed milk and the whiskey green tea. I pretty much like all the flavours I've tried......   I still got a lot of flavours to try... definitely will be back for more, especially in this heat!"}
{"text":"Kekou is my jam!! Love this spot on hot summer days. It is tiny, but the benches outside are always packed. They use really fresh ingredients (read: no artificial tasting flavours or wacky colours here) and have unique flavours that you can't find elsewhere. Some of my faves: HK milk tea, Vietnamese coffee, black sesame, spicy mango, and green bean coconut. For the more adventurous, check out the boozy whisky green tea. While it gets busy here, service is always efficient and with a smile. Don't forget to get a stamp card if you come often. You can also buy tubs and they even sell mini cooler bags to help keep the ice cream cold while you take it home."}
{"text":"Great flavours.  Great service.  Great everything.  This is fantastic gelato.  It's a little on the pricey side - but it offers things that no other gelato place makes.  Also - they make it without preservatives, and other such nonsense a lot of places add to make the stuff last if it doesn't sell.  This place is charming."}
{"text":"Hot damn this is good. After many many samples (all their flavours are hard to find) I got two scoops of jasmine tea and hk style tea. So much flavour. After tax cost is $6.50 but the flavour is so intense and the gelato hold together well so you can enjoy each bite slowly. Really love the Asian flavours.   5 stars out of 5.   Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"I was a bit sceptical about the idea of Asian gelato, but as long as it comes from Kekou it's going to be delicious! I wish there was a way for me to transport a pint of these flavours home, but they'd definitely melt on the 65km trip.   On my first visit I tried the tapioca pudding gelato - OMG. I wish I had ordered a large.  Next up, black sesame, divine. I love the Chinese black sesame dessert, but this is even better.  Spicy mango and guava plum salt - all refreshing and delicious unique flavours.    No stabilizers (gums) are used in their gelato and it's super fresh. When in the area I always try to make a side trip to Kekou - you should too!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to-place for some Asian inspired gelato.  All the flavors they have here are very refreshing and the perfect amount of sweetness and creaminess. It's not overly rich so it always leaves me wanting more.   I usually get the HK milk tea but today I tried the jasmine tea and think this is my new favorite.  Don't forget to pick up a stamp card because this is a place you'll be visiting more than once."}
{"text":"There are lots of flavours but get the Hong Kong Milk Tea and Viet Coffee! No line ups and way better than Arctic Bites 2 doors down! Definitely one of my fave gelato places!"}
{"text":"This. Blew. Me. Away. Confession: I loved it so much that I came back the next day. There, i said it!!  Avocado banana & black sesame gelato on a seaweed waffle cone. Say what?! The avocado banana gelato was a perfect blend the two components. Rich, creamy, smooth. And that black sesame?! Loved it, especially with the whole bits of black sesame seeds. And yes, I dared to try that seaweed waffle cone. Awesome balance of salty with sweet.  They have outdoor seating so a cone or cup is perfect for a spring or summer days.  Cute shop. Very clean. Friendly staff. I recommend this to anyone stopping by Toronto!"}
{"text":"One word: WOW. I was so incredibly impressed by Kekou that I would be perfectly happy with getting all my frozen treats here for the rest of my life. I'm a huge ice cream fan and have had a lot of different ice creams and ice cream flavors, but Kekou is by far the best place I've ever tried.   I don't know if it's the perfectly crafted gelato or the offbeat flavors that have caused me to fall in love with this place, but all I do know is that I really wish I had a Kekou close to home. I'll be sorry to have to leave them behind in Toronto when I return home to the Midwest (in the good ol' USA).  I only sampled one flavor (Roasted Oolong Milk Tea), but that one sample made me confident enough to order an additional second flavor (HK Milk Tea) blindly. OMG, the flavors couldn't have been tastier. Not only am I a sucker for ice cream, but I'm even more of a sucker for tea flavored ice creams. Kekou does right by them.   There were plenty of other flavors that I would have tried and would gladly do so on another trip. I just couldn't pass up flavors that I know I will love. The flavors are definitely geared towards Asian taste buds (which may explain why I love them so much), but even my mostly white boyfriend (quarter Japanese) really liked Kekou. We ended up getting the same flavors, which hardly ever happens, but he loves milk tea.   We both got our scoops on waffle cones, which I found to be satisfactory. The cones weren't mind-blowing by any means, but they will do as a vessel for ice cream. The ladies helping us were very friendly and made conversation with us. They offered us a punch card, which I would have gladly accepted, if I lived here.  Even so, I thought the prices were more than fair, especially after the conversion to US dollars. And the scoops are definitely of a good size. Kekou is just an awesome ice cream joint, and I would definitely come back on future trips.   Overall: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews, I was expecting something spectacular but I was underwhelmed. There's really nothing spectacular to it. I tried the rum flavored gelato and wished I had gone for something else. I'm pretty sure my choices had something to do with my overall experience. The workers were very patient and pleasant."}
{"text":"The closing time says 10:30pm on a Sunday but when we went there tonight it was closed...we were there at 9:30"}
{"text":"This is my fave place for ice-cream. I prefer these flavours over BangBang. And because it's actually gelato, it's lighter and has less fat.   The green bean coconut and peanut sesame are so addictive!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to their new location but I was a customer since it first opened on Baldwin Street!  I have filled in more than a few stamp cards. Kekou is one of my two favourite gelato shops in Toronto. My other favourite doesn't offer any of Asian flavours. Kekou's has always been so innovative and fresh. There is no place like it!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for gelato! I love the asian-inspired flavors, especially the almond tofu and red bean white chocolate. A little on the pricey side, but that's to be expected of gelato. They also give you a stamp card to make it worth your while if you're a frequent customer but be warned: they have an expiration date!  The staff is super friendly and allow for taste tests at no additional cost. Seating is limited inside but there are nice large benches right outside the store. I will be sad when they close for the winter, but the Queen location is open year round!"}
{"text":"The food & selection (4.5/5): I've been here more than ten times and I was never disappointed. Their gelato flavours are one of the most interesting I've seen. My favorites are Vietnamese coffee, green bean coconut and oolong milk tea. You can choose to have your gelato in a cup or a cone (which there are also several flavours). For fruity one, I like soursop. They also have soft serves in jasmine tea and almond tofu flavours, with this year's 2 additions, yogurt and passion fruit (dairy free), offered only during summer though. They also offer various types of drinks in this location.   Cost (3/5): $5 after tax for a medium cup with two flavours. They adjusted their price recently. A small one is cheaper than before ($3) but you only get one scope of one flavour. The large cup costs $7 I believe. They also changed the way they fill the ice cream. They used to fill the two flavors side by side and pack as much into the paper cup as they could. But now it's by scoop and they stack one on top of the other. So I think the medium cup i got this time was less than what I used to get.   Service (4/5): You can sample before getting an entire scope (which helps a lot since they have all these exotic flavours like spicy pineapple, green tea whiskey, rosewater pistachio, durian...). Staffs are quite friendly about it. You also get a stamp for each ice cream purchase. When you have collected 10 stamps, you'll be able to redeem a free one.   Ambience (3.5/5): The place is always busy and they have only a bench near the door, and two long tables and a round one in the store. You'll almost feel like you want to get out right after you're done so other people can sit - so it might not be the best place if you want to chill, talk and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I strongly advise you guys to try their Thai Iced Tea gelato flavour.  Freaking delicious.  And of course vietnamese coffee, that's some gooooooooood stuff.  That is all. :)"}
{"text":"I've procrastinated on writing a review for this place, but hey, what counts is that I'm getting to it right?!   This summer I was hanging out with my friend in Canada and she took me here after walking around Eaton Centre and hanging out at the Youth Faire that was happening at Dundas Square.   When we got there, I was overwhelmed by all the flavors that they had. I felt like a kid in a candy store! I'm not too big a fan of sweets, but this place definitely caught my eye, so much so that when I went to explore Toronto by myself, I stopped by AGAIN to try more flavors!   I absolutely love the spicy salted pineapple flavor. How they are able to achieve that amazing combination just baffles me. It's an explosion of flavor in your mouth when you take your first bite. It's a bit salty, then spicy, then sweet. I couldn't have enough of it!   I also love that they have milk tea flavors, vietnamese coffee, durian, and other exotic fruits.   Best gelato I've had anywhere, hands down. I can't wait to come back and have some more again. We definitely need to have one of these in the states."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever!  Now, I might be slightly biased considering I can't honestly say I've had gelato anywhere else... but Kekou has me addicted.    It's a cute little shop really close to work, and I came here two days in a row because the first experience was so impressive.  I've had the Vietnamese coffee flavour, black sesame, durian, and HK milk tea - while all were super indulgent, Vietnamese coffee came out as my clear favourite.  Black sesame is not new to me, but just couldn't get used to the grittiness (not to mention all the bits that must have stuck to teeth afterwards).  I vaguely wonder if they've toned down the durian flavour, since it wasn't as strong as I remember from the actual fruit :P   I don't know if it's just the humid temps the 2 days I visited, but I found that one flavour out of the two in a small cup always melts faster than the other... this gets slightly difficult to enjoy given the tiny plastic scoop (with a tiny indentation as the spoon) before the flavours melt into an indistinguishable soup.  However, I'm well on my way to becoming a regular + completing my first stamp card; the nice price at $3.75 (with tax) for a small doesn't hurt either.  New favourite dessert place.  This could get dangerous."}
{"text":"OMG where to start.. They got so many amazing flavours to pick from and most important is they got durian! Soo yummy! I recommend this place for everyone. Always get a sample before you order so you won't regret if you got the right scoop!"}
{"text":"Order first, pay after. Theres a big crowd of people everwhere, so it was confusing as a first time customer.   Got the spicy pineapple and HK milk tea.  - spicy pineapple has got a kick to it. especially after a while. saw a red chili flake in it near the end of it. its good, but it gets tiring after a while.  - HK milk tea tastes like it is described."}
{"text":"Quaint and small, it's a fresh addition to the Baldwin scene. Features Asian inspired gelatos ranging from grean bean coconut  to vanilla lotus.  I sampled durian to brag about consuming on of the smelliest things on earth and settled on spicy mango and strawberry lychee.  Delicious (even the durian) . You can even mix flavours in the small size. It's a ghost online except for it's humble website.   I'll go back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love asian flavor gelato?!?!??! I've been here two in the past two days and this place is absolutely amazing. All there flavors are extremely unique from Durian to HK milk tea. Today I got the Viet coffee and spicy pineapple, love love love both of them. I would definitely come back multiple times this summer. A small cup of gelato (2 different flavors) came up to $3.95 with tax.   The shop is very cute on the inside and they let you try as many flavors as you would like.  Highly recommend this place if your in the area!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, and ties with Greg's Ice Cream for one of my favorite dessert places in the city.  I've always liked black sesame ice cream and I've found it difficult to find in Toronto, but then Kekou came around and blew me away - it's better than any black sesame ice cream I've had in my life. I especially like the texture because they make it in-house, you can find bits of sesame seeds in your gelato.  They also have durian flavour, which I love, because it tastes exactly like durian, and doesn't seem to have extra sugar or anything added to it to modify the taste. The texture is creamier than the black sesame too, which is appropriate for durian. Durian's awesome, haters gonna hate.  Be sure to sample several flavours before you make your choices!"}
{"text":"The gelato here is great. They are all very flavourful and taste like the flavour they are supposed to be. I love how they make the tea flavoured gelatos. They taste just like tea."}
{"text":"Kekou is such a delicious, relaxing, and unique dessert spot!   If you are a lover of teas, let alone gelato, this place is a must visit!   I got the roasted oolong tea and my boyfriend has the Vietnamese coffee - both were incredible!  The prices were fair, the staff were friendly, and the location was comfortable.  If we are ever in Toronto we most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Loooveeee this place! My favorite is the Vietnamese Coffee followed by the Whiskey Green Tea. The staff was very friendly. We were able to try a couple of samples before purchasing. Oolong tea, red bean, black sesame..they all sound so delicious! Highly recommend this place if you're around the area! I will definitely be back to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place by accident while having Ramen near Baldwin. Very quint little settlement. All home made and unique flavors!!  I had the ginger milk, durian and jasmine tea! They were all superb!!!  Gotta try them out if u like Asian centric flavors. It Doesn't have normal flavors, but if u want that, just go to the grocers and get ur self tub of Generic brand.    They also have soy based gelato, good for people that can't take dairy.  I will be back for more, maybe buy a tub to serve at home!"}
{"text":"Kekou Gelato House is literally a small house on the block on Baldwin Street :) They specialize in many of the best Asian inspired gelato flavours in Toronto! You seriously can't go wrong with Green Tea Whiskey, Viet Coffee, and Roasted Oolong Tea!  And if you are feeling REALLY adventurous - I dare you to try the King of all fruits - Durian ;) Tastes like heaven but smells like hell LMAO. It is a staple at Kekou (not kidding!) :D This pungent fruit is loved by many, especially by my whole family - okay, maybe not my dad (he runs as far as possible hahaha)! It is not really for everyone lol.   I will definitely be visiting Kekou all summer long - it is located at a buzzing neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and small boutiques. They are not opened during winter season if I'm not mistaken. There is usually no line ups, quick serivce, and they make sure you sample first! The girls working there are so patient and friendly.  They also have another Kekou at Queen & Spadina - that one offers an even larger menu from gelato and chocolate dipped popsicles to soft serve and beverages. Totally worth checking out :) You can also use the stamp card for both location. Redeem 9 stamps for a free medium size frozen treat of your choice!"}
{"text":"Asian Gelato heaven!!! oh my wow!!!   so I have never had Asian inspired Gelato before and it was so interesting to see the many different flavours this shop had to offer. from spicy sweet, salty sweet, to sour sweet. they had everything.  the place was cute and I don't know if its just me but this place looked like we picked it up from japan and plopped it right in the middle of Baldwin street. LOL.   the flavours I have tried were the chocolate ginger (very interesting mix) I would eat that if I was sick because ginger is good for sore throats, but I ended up with a scoop of red bean white chocolate ( probably the best read bean ice cream/gelato I have ever tasted), my friend who was with me had the spicy pineapple and oh me oh my that was an a good, interesting flavour .   they also had sesame flavour and other cool and interesting flavour. I would for sure bring my family here to try it out, and I am for sure coming back :)"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place :\") They have the best icecream and gelato flavours, and I'd really recommend you to come here if you're craving to try something new. They have flavours such as HK milk tea, peanut sesame, rum etc. You might think the flavours are odd but they honestly do a really good job on balancing the texture, flavours and sweetness of their icecream. The people who work there are also really nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"What a place!  The service and the goods were just out of the world! It is asian inspired gelato boutique ice cream shop. Offering some pretty amazing flavors. If you dare, you can make some pretty trippy combos. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I live super near the place so Kekou Gelato is my go to \"mood destresser\". They have unsual ice cream flavours for every mood! Recommend 100%. Personal fav - ginger chocolate"}
{"text":"Come to Kekou if you want a unique, Asian-inspired gelato experience. All of the gelato and sorbet flavors are designed for the Asian palate: durian fruit, milk tea, spicy salted pineapple, while chocolate red bean, and more. To be honest, I sampled quite a few that were a bit off-putting to my white person palate. But I ended up getting the Vietnamese coffee, which was delicious. Check it out if you're tired of boring old chocolate or blueberry and want something different."}
{"text":"Their osmanthus berry flavour was really good (dairy free option), fresh without being icy! As for ones with dairy, their HK milk is so flavourful, and the rum and condensed milk was the perfect consistency."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I got the most amazing ice cream sandwich. They had several cookie options to choose from, and I chose two different types of cookies, and pistachio ice cream. And WOW. It was simply amazing! The cookie was buttery, but not too crumbly, and it paired perfectly with the ice cream. The ice cream actually tasted like pistachio - not the green artificial crap you find at many ice cream shops.   A month later I returned a second time for my beloved ice cream sandwich, only to be told that they no longer sell cookies.   WHAT?!   I was so shocked, that I turned around and walked out.   I know I was being a princess about this, but it was the combination of the cookies AND ice cream that had me coming back. Ice cream alone did not warrant a second visit - I know plenty of great ice cream shops closer to home."}
{"text":"Love everything about Kekou. I don't normally like ice cream (gasp, I know!), but this is my exception. Flavours are on point and texture is perfect. The location is great as well as there are other fantastic restaurants and boutiques on the same strip. The store itself is a cute little house with a good amount of seating out front. Servers are always friendly, fast and patient. They encourage customers to try a flavour before buying. Best flavours in my opinion: roasted oolong tea, hk milk tea, whiskey green tea, and rum and condensed milk. All of these taste like the real thing because real ingredients are used for the ice cream. Overall, Kekou does everything simply, but well. Definitely one of my summer favourites."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!   If you're looking for something beyond the typical pistachio and mocha chocolate flavours of gelato, come to Baldwin street and try out these one of a kind flavours! Even if you're not the adventurous type, there's something for everyone. Tame flavours like Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, and mango are crowd pleasers while the adventurous will find something new in green bean coconut, durian, and red bean white chocolate, among many others.   The flavours I have tried are all wonderful and just so yummy. It's a great way to cap off a night if you just had dinner on Baldwin. There are special waffle cones (black sesame and seaweed from my observation) that I'd like to try sometime. A friend had black sesame last time and was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a little on the savoury side; a really nice compliment to her mango scoop.  Like an average gelato house or other good ice cream parlours, they have little spoons for tasting. I wish they would use wooden spoons, or something biodegradable, however, as I'm sure they fly through thousands of those little plastic spoons only to end up in the trash after mere seconds of a taste. That's my only criticism, but it is one of great concern. I'll be back for sure, I just hope you guys look into spoons that are a little more environmentally friendly!"}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around Baldwin Village after dinner at Wah Sing.   Tried the durian, coconut and vietnamese coffee.  Really liked all 3! The durian's smell is a bit off putting but once you get over it, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  My first time here, it was so hidden and such a small place that I didn't expect much out of it.   I got to taste test all the flavors because the worker was super nice! I ordered two scoops: Vietnamese coffee and mango. They were to die for! I could say its the most flavorful gelato I've ever had. The texture was just right, not too creamy feeling and not too watery. Just enough for you to keep it in your mouth for the full flavor. So tasty; definitely recommending everyone and anyone to try this if you haven't already! Its really hidden and its the same street as guu ! Definitely look for it!   Update: so my sister decided to buy boxes of gelato from here back home where we live in Markham. The black sesame is full of flavor as well as durian. However, I fully believe that Durian has a distinct flavor and smell to it that people may not prefer but it is worth to try. Their newest flavor is the Jasmine tea and the HK milk tea. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Love the asian flavours gelato! They made gelato with real fruit, so the flavours selection may change due to availability of the fruit.  My favorites are Vietnamese Coffee, Pandan, Black Sesames. If you like Durian, you must go there and the Durian gelato!!  You can pick 2 flavors for S/M size, 3 flavours for L size. Portion is generous and price very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I loved the variety of flavours. The sizes and pricing are very fair and it's cool that you can get 2 flavours in a small.  The service was very efficient, friendly, and helpful.  I can't wait to go back and try more flavours.   P.S. Durian is interesting, but smells like cat pee."}
{"text":"Best gelato place I've been to so far. Big fan of this place because of their wicked and very unique flavors. They were happy to provide me samples of flavors I asked for. I ended up getting a medium cup which cam with 2 flavors. I got Rum & Condensed Milk and Red Bean White Chocolate. I tried the Whiskey Green Tea also. All of these flavors are really good. Will definitely come back to get new flavors. I went around 8ish on a Thursday and there was no line. Prices are reasonable and they provide you with a stamp card: Buy 9 and get 1 free I think."}
{"text":"A great little Asian inspired Gelato joint. It would get 5 stars from me if it had a few more flavours. Nevertheless, its a must visit place if you are craving for Gelato. They offer free sampling and you can enjoy your treat in a bowl or waffle cone.  The staff here is very friendly and there is an indoor and outdoor seating area. Its located just east of Spadina on Baldwin. For the record I had a green been and coconut gelato in a waffle cone, this is a sweet way to finish off a meal :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite gelato places ever, and I visit a lot of gelato places (well I have in the past before I found this place - and before Yelp days).  It's simple but complex...the flavours are atypical but so delicious. Why have I only tried the mango though...  The storefronts are contemporary. I've been to both locations and the Baldwin location is very quaint complete with patterned yellow wallpaper.   I've been eying the gelato bars for some time now, and I finally decided to get one - BEST DECISION EVER.   Yes, it's pricey. But it sure is delicious. The jasmine gelato interior is so nicely complemented with a white chocolate exterior and great crunch from the pecans.   As I mentioned they have unique gelato flavours as well such as various teas. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very Interesting unique flavors, I love the Vietnamese Coffee and green tea whiskey if you want to experiment things. The flavors are strong and lasting, a good quality place to be. They also give you a voucher that can be stamped after each purchase and you unlock free goodies.   If you want to sit, they offer limited space inside and outside. I gave this place 4 stars because I found the gelato to be rather on the expensive side.   Nevertheless, a must go for all these exotic and interesting Asian flavors."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best gelato places I've ever been to!  I went here twice, or maybe three times? I can't remember. All I remember was the strike of instant happiness at the first taste of my gelato. I've tried the red bean white chocolate, HK milk tea, vietnamese coffee, and the osthmanthus plum berry. The flavours are distinct and rich, and the gelato itself is very smooth and refreshing. It's a great treat when you're strolling downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Favourite gelato place in Toronto - I love their Asian flavours, aesthetic, and hospitality. I always order the almond tofu since it brings me back to my childhood.   Not recommended for groups. The space in both Kekou gelatos is better for up to 4 people in a group.  You need to pay first before you can start sampling flavours and they are very patient if you're an indecisive gelato lover like me. Friendly service and I never feel rushed to tell them what flavour I've decided on.  It's around $7 for 2 scoops, but because the flavours are so unique and the portion size leaves me very content, I don't really mind dishing out a bit.   I have also tried their jasmine tea which has quickly become one of my faves as well! It tastes like an amped up version of jasmine tea that you would normally get during dim sum."}
{"text":"THE BEST and never disappoints! Their flavours are Asian inspired/super unique (durian, rosewater pistachio, almond tofu, vietnamese coffee etc) and they give you huge scoops of their gelato for a very reasonable price! Love it!  The flavours are extremely true to the \"real\" thing--you can really tell that they are making their gelato from scratch because you won't taste any artificial flavours!  I'm a huge sucker for durian, so of course my favourite pick is their durian flavoured ice cream. It actually has pieces of durian mixed in, and I'm starting to think getting their durian ice cream might be more worth it than buying an actual durian (that fruit is expensive!!!).....seriously, it's THAT good!!!  The texture of their gelato is not as smooth or creamy as other gelato places I've been to, but you very easily forget that once you have a taste of their ice cream. It's the bomb."}
{"text":"Arguably the best gelato place downtown with bonus points for its unique flavours! Kekou is in a cute little house with a long, narrow space that barely fits its counters. Most recently, I came on a Friday night after dinner and the line-up made a bend! Though the queue moves fast, you will need that time to decide between its many appealing offerings. Staff are cool with giving out samples and are pretty efficient. My absolute fav is the Roasted Oolong Tea, which tastes like roasted taiwanese milk tea in gelato form.. it's so toasty! Backup HK Milk tea if they're out. Whiskey Green Tea is good too and yes, there's real alcohol in there. $2.85 for a small is a steal these days. For parties, be a hero and get a pint - $10.50 for 2 flavours and they even put it in a paper bag of ice so it doesn't melt. They have stamp cards to collect points!  There's no seating indoors but they have some on the porch as well as two long benches flanking both sides of their front patio. They turn on the string lights at night and it's such a lovely spot to be in when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Try tato. Its the best!!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place for deserts. He had Horchata and i had to have the Salted Carmel unbelievably delicious. I will definitely visit here again. They also had some amazing cakes made of gelato."}
{"text":"My fav gelato spot in Toronto!!! I love all of their flavors but my favorites are green tea whiskey, rosewater pistachio, peanut sesame, Viet coffee, red bean sticky rice, HK milk tea, oolong milk tea... Ya pretty much the whole menu. I hope they bring back the rice wine and tsing Tao peach !!! And I also hope they open up the Baldwin location again but it doesn't look like they will anytime soon :("}
{"text":"OK for me, not that exceptional, but should be encouraged.  Interesting flavors but lots of them ultimately taste quite the same... between green tea, macha, panda, banana avocado... not much of a difference and not smooth-creamy enough to my European taste.  All are globally low in sugar and a large cup is what you usually will get as medium in other gelatto places (thus a small one is really small here!).  I may try again, as the location is pretty convenient (an after a kinton ramen, an ice cream is a good pick), but will chose more classic flavors to see if they do better in those."}
{"text":"Really good ice cream! HK milk tea tastes like bubble tea! Black sesame is also delish! Just don't expect a smile, the girls serving look grumpy and roll their eyes when you ask for a sample...but ice cream should help sweeten the sour service."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Gelato flavours true to it's name :)  So far I've tried: Jasmine tea - a must try, rich in tea flavours Durian - tastes like the real deal Cashews - alright Peanut Sesame - if you like pb, this is the 1 Guava Plum Salt - fragrant and light Green Bean Coconut - tastes like coconut mung bean pudding Black Sesame - great sesame crunch Vietnamese Coffee - rich, nice aroma  I have more flavours yet to try, but I'm a fan of this place! Also great friendly service, and they offer sample tasters ;)"}
{"text":"tried hk milk tea gelato and spicy salted pineapple gelato, it was good but not surprising, the place is small but well organized. will come back"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot with a ton of Asian flavours. I'm not a gelato expert but I am probably the biggest expert on ice cream here on Yelp.  Creamy and lots of flavour in the gelato here. Portions are small but they're all right for the price you pay. I had the milk tea and matcha flavors which tasted exactly like what they were supposed to.  The negative things I can comment on is the wait during the summer and some of the ice creams are too sweet. I would prefer a less sweet ice cream to better appreciate their flavors but it's hard to satisfy every customer's tolerance for sweetness.  Otherwise great little ice cream joint that's only open seasonally!"}
{"text":"Love it!  There's flavours for various different fruits and Asian beverages like Osmanthus Plum; HK milk tea; Vietnamese Coffee and Soursop, durian, etc...  The girls behind the counter were very friendly and seem to enjoy interacting with the customers   Ice cream was delicious!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was good, it tasted just like their other location but the service threw me off. It looked like some of the employees were not enjoying their job but there was an employee there who made it worth it. I will definitely come back and hope that my review changes."}
{"text":"So happy with their second shop. This is definitely my favourite ice cream joint in the city.   With a rotating assortment of flavours, along with a multitude of choices - whether soft serve, traditional scoops, sorbets or Popsicles, there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"What to do on a blazing hot day? Get yourself some gelato at Kekou to cool off!! Once you step inside, you will be hit with a strong scent of durian. But don't worry, durian flavour is not all they serve! They have so many flavours to choose from and you are allowed to sample until you're content before ordering!  I sampled the Black Sesame, HK Milk Tea and Whisky Green tea. The Whisky Green Tea one was definitely not my cup of tea. Did not hit me right and I don't really know what to make of it. I suppose its an acquired taste? So.. I opted in for the HK Milk Tea and the Black Sesame. The milk tea taste exactly like the milk teas you'd get at a chinese cafe. Very creamy and filled with flavour and same goes for the black sesame. Very strong flavour of black sesame, just the way I like it! They're not overly sweet just sweet enough to satisfy those taste buds. I tried my friend's Durian, Viet Coffee and Coconut gelatos. If you're a durian lover, definitely go for the durian! Every spoonful is loaded with durian-goodness! I wasn't too crazy about the coconut flavour. It was simple but, still pretty good and same goes for the viet coffee. You get a choice of 2 scoops (around $4) or 1 scoop (around $3). Honestly.. you can't just stick with one flavour, two flavours the way to go!!  The atmosphere is very chill. There are tables and benches for you to enjoy your gelato. Pretty neat how they also have tea leaves in small jars on the tables for you to smell; cute! Lots of natural light from their big window which makes it perfect for selfies or pics of your gelato. Staff was very welcoming and friendly. Definitely will be returning to try their other flavours!!!"}
{"text":"A true 5 star find for gelato! They have Asian inspired gelato and the stinky fruit one is sooooo good. Omg, if you also like Vietnamese coffee, they have a gelato flavour as well. Perfect stop for when you are having lunch on Baldwin. This place is across the street from a Mexican restaurant and is near the University of Toronto. Come here for a cold summer treat. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Yay! I really like this place and everyone should go and just be happy. A friend took me here for the first time and I was surprised to find that they had every delicious asian ice cream flavour you could think of. It was so good that I came twice more that week (I know, I'm a horrible person). I've tried most of their flavours and they were all delicious. My favourites are the black sesame, red bean/white chocolate, and the soursop. Get it in a sesame cone :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Gelato House. I like durian paired with a sweet flavour. The Vanilla Lotus Bean has real vanilla and fat Lotus beans. The choice of flavours is large. Try them all!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of gelato but this little gelato store made me like it.  What sets this gelato place from the rest are the unique flavours that they serve, look at my posted pic.   I tried the Durian (not a big fan but my wife was blown away by it), Vanilla with Lotus, Soursop,  Guava Plumsalt and Black Sesame.  At the end I picked Guava Plum Salt and Soursop.  The soursop was a nice palette cleanser after my extremely salty ramen at Kinton(different story).  And the Guava was extremely refreshing (more salt in it) but it wasn't as salty as I would have expected.  It had the taste of the sour plums you get at the chinese supermarkets.  The Durian to my surprise was actually not bad, I don't think I can eat one myself but it was extremely smooth and packed a durian punch.  Even if you're not a gelato fan, it's definitely worth trying atleast once for all the unique flavours you just cant get at the regular gelato places."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato. I tried the durian × avocado banana and it tastes just as it sounds. Mmm. The boyfriend got whiskey green tea × red bean white chocolate. The whiskey green tea was a lot strong that expected - the strong matcha flavour at first then you kinda get punched with whiskey. The red bean white chocolate helped to balance it out with its sweetness - definitely more chocolatey than red bean.   Can't wait to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"You know, contrary to most people, I actually LOVE durian -- pungent smell and all.  You know what I also love? Gelato.   So when I find a place that combines two things I love, I. FREAK. THE FLIP. OUT. Kekou Gelato House is a unique ice cream shop in that it turns traditional Asian snack/fruit flavors into gelato.   First impressions? This shop is cute as heck -- the outside is very charming and I love the neighborhood that it's in. There's limited seating inside, but there are benches and stairs outside available if you'd like to sit and relax with your creamy treats. It's also fairly close to Chinatown; like, a ten minute walk.  When we arrived, there was already a hefty line forming out the door, but we made it just in time to beat the rush. I ordered a small cup of the Durian and Vietnamese Coffee gelato. At first, I was wary that the flavor wouldn't be all there (since a lot of people are actually scared of eating durian, I thought they would've toned it down), but they definitely packed it in there! I loved it; and the coffee wasn't too shabby either, I swear I almost got a caffeine buzz. I also sampled the Spicy Salted Pineapple and the Mango, and they were both fabulous. My family likes to dip sweet pineapple in a chili-infused salt mixture and I gotta say that the flavor of the gelato was spot on. It would be so awesome to see how they make these ice creams.   Service was incredibly friendly; the girls behind the counter were very informative and answered any questions I had, as well as generous with any samples I wanted. The line also moved pretty quickly, so you can tell that they're used to the crowds.   I do wish I'd gotten the chance to try out more of their flavors, like the Rice Wine Milk or the Tsingtao Peach -- but I guess that means I just need to visit Toronto more often. So, if you're in the area (or even if you're not), I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love love love the roasted oolong gelato. Loved it so much that I actually preferred it over some of the oolong tea I've had as of late. I ordered it for friends with the intention of having a spoon or two (because I'm lactose intolerant) but that quickly went out the window... My bowels send their regards"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but very strong flavors!  I got matcha and green tea ice cream when I came to visit here & they were pretty good.   Something I really like about Kekou is you don't get short changed in the flavor department. For example, the green tea gelato was verrry fragrant and flavorful. Don't think.. green tea drink, think of consuming the raw herbs (In a good way?).. I would almost recommend asking someone working for a milder flavor if you're not used to super bold flavors.   Gelato is always more expensive than regular ice  cream and almost always worth the price. Try it!"}
{"text":"I can really try every single flavour at Kekou Gelato House?!  The friendly lady did let me sample almost half of what they offers and the more I tried, the more I could not make up my mind!!  But here I sampled one of the best Black Sesame flavour I ever tried! So intense and love those bits of real sesame inside...   Durian Gelato has such good flavours! It is just like I am eating the real fruit with no filler at all.... I can eat the whole tub by myself.  I can eat those 2 flavours everyday and I would be a happy content person.  But seriously, Coconut Sticky Rice? Spicy Mango? Coconut? Vietnamese Coffee? Ube?  I am in LOVE!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best place for gelato in Toronto but it is undoubtedly the best place for Asian inspired gelato. Expect a line on hot days (for the Queen St location as well). Love that they let you try different flavours (and I've never had a cap on how many I could try). My favourite flavours are the Hong Kong milk tea, Vietnamese coffee, and mango."}
{"text":"All 5 star ice creams! They have lots of Asian Falcons like sesame, Hongkong milk tea, Viet Coffee, durian, roasted oolong and whisky green tea etc. all taste very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Jasmine flavored Gelato YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!   A lot of times gelato has a soft or subtle hint of the flavor when you go as bold as a floral tea flavor but this gelato was, dare I say, perfect. Although not the most creamy, has the most \"punch in your face\" flavor!  ***I recommend if you are a tea fan.*** The Red Bean and White Chocolate gelato has the skin of the red beans in it and has a very well balanced flavor of the two.   Customer service was on point and were very nice with answering any questions of the gelatos. Also, there was not a cap on how many you could sample!   The building itself is a bit on the small side so if you have a group of people with you, you may have to take turns. They do have a nice porch on the outside with seating as well which allows for time to take up the unique scenery."}
{"text":"The perfect place to stop on a sunny day for some delicious gelato! Saw a couple of reviews beforehand and thought I would try it out with a friend. It's quite close to UofT and the store feels very homey. If you don't look for the store, you might pass by it!  I absolutely adored the selection of flavours that were available. As an Asian, I really appreciate the Asian inspired flavours like Durian, milk tea, black sesame ect.  I had a hard time choosing, but finally settled on a scoop of HK milk tea and Durian. Can't wait to come back and try the other flavours!   Tip: remember to grab one of their stamp cards!"}
{"text":"If I live near Kekou, I will most likely border obesity.   Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, durian, red bean white chocolate, green bean coconut, spicy mango, peanut sesame, Thai tea, black sesame....yup, these are not your everyday gelato. If you are seeking authentic traditional Italian flavours, you've came to the wrong place.   Head to Kekou for stabilizer free, chemical-free exotic gelato ($3.57- 4.42) made in delicious small batches! My favorite is Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Super unique flavours in a cute little house that you can easily miss if you're not looking too carefully. FYI, this location doesn't have soft serve (which I love...the Jasmine is to die for), but still all the gelato flavours. My go-to is Vietnamese coffee. I get a bit of a caffeine rush from it...so great. This is my go-to if I'm craving gelato in the area!"}
{"text":"This Asian inspired Gelato \"house\" is definitely a must visit if you're on Queen Street.  Sampled most of the flavours and I was instantly drawn to the almond tofu flavour. I highly recommend the almond tofu, Vietnamese coffee, durian, rose water pistachio, and red bean white chocolate.  The flavours may seem gimmicky but oh damn they're oh so worth it. It's $11 for a pint -- it's a bit small but they're tremendously tasty.  Make sure to get yourself a stamp card for future visits here.  Staff are friendly and welcoming and it's a must recommend if you're around the area. Wide selection and $3.50 for a scoop; can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was here with friends for  some dessert. They  have their own unique range of Asian inspired  gelatos and they let you sample some of them.  I got pistachio rosewater,  and vietnamese coffee.  and my friends and I sampled a bunch of flavors like the  osmanthus plum berry, green tea whiskey, hongkong milk tea, avocado  , and black sesame.  There is a promotion they have where they  give u a card and  as you fill it up with purchases you can get rewards to redeem. I plan to redeem the last reard which is a pint of your choice of  gelato.  So for now the plan is to try out new flavours and finish off with a pint of my favourite .  This is a must try gelato place to take you friends and enjoy some gelato."}
{"text":"Some flavors are too sweet. I ordered 3 different flavors but they gave me 2 same. Disappointing for walking nearly 1km to find the store and didn't get the good as the reviews."}
{"text":"What really makes Kekou different from any other cold dessert place is their innovative flavours...   Durian? YES. Roasted oolong tea? YES. HK Style Milk Tea? YOU BET.  My asian palette has never been more thankful.   Another great thing about Kekou is the freshness. When the friendly staff scooped the durian ice cream...oh my. It was as if the durian was actually there. Good stuff.  Be warned though... their gelato is pretty airy and fluffy and they don't have a lot of interior space. They set up a bunch of benches on the outside, but in 30 degree plus weather, your will melt really quickly (but guess that's another reason to believe that their products don't contain preservatives). Try to enjoy swiftly or in an air conditioned room!"}
{"text":"Kekou is a hidden gem on Baldwin St. It serves up a number of Asian-influenced gelato flavors. So far I have tried the black sesame, the peanut sesame, and the Vietnamese coffee. All three options were really good, but my favorite by far is the peanut sesame. It's a great place to be during the hot Toronto summer months. The prices are very reasonable, which makes it a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Oh my goodness. Go here.   If you like that soft serve stuff in any of its reincarnations (cones from McDonalds, Menchies and other pay-by-weight places where you load your chemical soft serve with skittles, Twizzlers, and sour keys), either you'll hate this place or if you are open to new experiences - you'll be blown away. Fact: I am not like the person I described above.  I love gelato, more specifically, I love home-made/made on premise gelato. Ok where do I start? I love the concept of this place - what an amazing idea. It brings all of my favorite flavours to a medium that is so widely accepted! The quality of the gelato is excellent so I think it will help encourage ppl experience new flavours that they otherwise may not have any interest in, like Sour sop, Green bean, Durian, Lotus Seed, Red bean, Black Sesame, etc. They do it creatively as well by mixing it with something more familiar, like Vanilla lotus seed and coconut green bean. Of course they have familiar flavours as well, like strawberry-lychee and mango.  The product is very good - smooth, silky, creamy. Very clean with no aftertaste. The right consistency and not icy at all. I tried the black sesame (features crushed black sesame seeds for an interesting texture), banana avocado (more banana than avocado, but avocado doesn't really have a bold flavour so I think this imbalance keeps it from being bland. very creamy), vanilla lotus seed (has half lotus seeds in it), and cashew (creamy, tasted like cashews).  The service was excellent. The customer in front of me tried too many flavours despite the long line up behind him (sample abusers ARE THE WORST) and the counter help was still so nice. Service with a smile. They are also very happy to give recommendations. There's no seating inside, but they have benches outside which is nice, and great to sit on to enjoy Baldwin street on a beautiful summer night. Probably not ideal in the winter but who cares.   I love that they serve their gelatos out beneath the counter containers like they do in Italy. The counter is in an L shape with small labels on the glass. The flavours are also written outside on a chalk board, and posted inside on a board. They must make their gelato in small batches because I was there around 8 or 9 and they were sold out of 5-8 different flavours.  Last point: Since extensively travelling Italy years ago with my BFF, I've had a love affair with gelato. I am willing to pay a premium for a good product b/c there are too many unnatural (aka bad) tasting gelatos out there. Luckily, for $3.75 (small) you get a good sized amount and get to try two flavours so it's easy on the wallet and for a very satisfying amount. Def looking forward to going back and trying out the flavours I missed out on."}
{"text":"Yummy gelato. Got viet coffee and durian. Durian tasted like i was biting out of an actual fruit. Viet coffee was delicious as well   Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Ice cream. It makes the world go round. This place is conveniently located next to the Japanese gift shop, and offers a variety of different flavors. All really tasty and delicious. Plus the girls working are really nice and soft-spoken. All in all a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I've come to realize I love gelato more than ice cream. This is by far my favourite place to go. The flavours are unique and satisfy my craving for something sweet -- but slightly healthier.  They now also have drinks, popsicles etc. It's nice to see they've expanded from just gelato.  This is always a place I'm more than happy to go!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 star!   Pros: -very unique concept  -lots of new unusual flavours to try -very helpful staff & you can see the gelato being made  Cons: -can't actually see the gelato until she scoops it out (loses visual points) -VERY icy texture in most of them.. I had the spicy mango and I felt like I was eating a crushed ice pop instead of proper gelato :(  Overall, I like this place :) it's a great novelty to have sometimes, but they should work on their texture.  Thought I would add a side note to my review:  I am aware that sorbetto is more icy than gelato. I've had wonderfully creamy sorbetto before. Don't lose hope. It IS doable."}
{"text":"very awesome gelato... the flavors keep changing.    They specialize in asian flavors and all made with fresh ingredients which you can taste in every bite.  its really a hidden gem within the city..."}
{"text":"I've tried the Thai milk tea, HK milk tea and Oolong. If you like tea flavoured things like me you'll definitely like this place. The gelato is quite flavourful and the service was excellent! You get to sample it before commiting."}
{"text":"My favourite ice cream place in town! There's no fancy toppings and other showy thing, just pure good ice cream! The ice cream always had such rich flavours that brings you back time after time!"}
{"text":"Kekou Gelato House (@KekouGelato), newly open in Baldwin St is perfectly located with all the Asian restaurant around. While the gelato is made the Italian Way, the flavors are very much Asian Flavored.  Love the space which is bright and sunny with super friendly staff and are all happy to offer samples. After hearing they have Durian gelato, I just had to give it a try  They offer Non Diary flavors which is different and perfect for lactose intolerant people     They use traditional Pozzetti Cabinet which keeps the gelato free from contaminants, air and sunshine; keeping it in its original form longer.  Plus all of their bases are made in house and aged for 10-12 hour.   We got a Medium for $4.25 and choice of 3 flavors.  Spicy Mango ~ sold in street carts and snacks shop, this gelato totally capture all the flavors Durian ~ A bit lighter then the actual fruit but still very flavorful with bits of fruits in it, so good that we end up buying a whole container home. Stinky goodness!!! Soursop  ~ love to get the milkshake at pho/Vietnamese restaurants, so just had to get this frozen version    Verdict : Never had Asian flavors gelato anywhere else and I love it Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the flavors (^_^)"}
{"text":"I actually LOVE this place so much.  The flavours of gelato here give me life, especially viet coffee and durian. The variety they offer is amazing, and really fuse tradition with modernity.   The aesthetic of the place has no question, it's apparent in pictures that it's IG worthy inside.  The staff is so nice, if it's not busy they let you try a lot of different flavours to pick which compliment each other and what you like! Because the range of flavours are slightly irregular, this is super important (at least in my opinion).  Love everything about this place - always want to go back even in the winter"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are a fan of Asian-flavoured ice crem. I have yet to try the whole menu but my current favourites are rice wine milk and HK milk tea. The flavours are super authentic and I can't get enough of it!  I also love that they put a spin on more traditional Asian flavours - like red bean white chocolate, whisky green tea, and green bean coconut. And for those less adventurous gelato lovers, they have some pretty basic options as well, like mango and black sesame.   And FYI- they have durian gelato, and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I ordered the HK milk tea and pistachio rose water gelato. It was delicious! And such a good deal. Very much worth it! 10/10 recommend this place!"}
{"text":"HACK#1: Taste test/choose your flavour AFTER you pay for a 1 or 2 scoop! Their staff is super nice about giving samples once you commit to purchasing at the cash register first.  HACK#2:  Sugar cone or have it in a cup for no extra cost.  HACK#3: Get a stamp card here if you go often.  Selection is good and I love how the flavours have an Asian flare to them! $3.75 for a scoop (which was a standard size) is quite worth it.  My favourites are: Rosewater Pistachio, Rum condensed milk, Red bean White Chocolate, HK milk tea, and Almond Tofu.  I personally felt that the Viet coffee didn't have as much creamy/milky sweetness as it should.   I also found that kekou's formula isn't the most friendly to my lactose-sensitive tummy, but the flavours are so hard to say no to! Next time, I will definitely give their sorbets a shot."}
{"text":"Price: around $4 for 1 scope My favourite: durian ice cream Also, remember to collect points at this place!  There are many many ice cream store around the entertainment district. However, I like this one mainly because of its durian favour ice cream. It got some rare favour ice cream like Hong Kong milk tea, durian, Vietnam coffee and lotus. It also got a nice sit-down place so you could rest while you eat. I like the sweetness, it is too sweet, but it is also fruity. It is a bit pricy. I recommend this place when you want to chat with your friend on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Kekou's closing for the winter!  Last chance to get some Asian gelato in 2013 is THIS Sunday, Nov 17.  They are slated to re-open in March 2014.  See my previous reviews for flavour recommendations."}
{"text":"I like the idea of east meet west. Western gelato  incorporating eastern flavors: HK milk tea, whisky green tea, spicy mango. All these nostalgic refreshing flavors. Ordered the whisky green tea and spicy mango.  Spicy mango was sweet, and has a nice heat to it. Loved the whisky green tea. Not overpowering and with the right amount of whisky"}
{"text":"I love the concept but I haven't managed to fall in love with the actual flavours. The flavours I like are often mixed with something that I don't like. E.g. Lychee & some alcohol like whiskey or something. I also found that the Queen and Spadina location smelled rather funky. So I say this is worth a try but I don't find myself coming back or craving their gelatos."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've been that has authentic durian gelato! It is such a cute little place in Baldwin Village with pretty fairy lights surrounding its entrance. They have awesome and unique flavours such as durian, soursop, tsing tsao peach, black sesame, viet coffee, HK style milk tea, roasted oolong milk tea and so much more! I got the small cup with one scoop of Vietnamese coffee and one scoop of durian flavour! It was so refreshing and I'll definitely be back! Also, the service was great and they were patient in letting my friends and try many flavours."}
{"text":"Really love their interesting AND tasty flavours!! The ladies are nice too.. love that they let you taste as many before committing to a couple scoops, which is always a shame that i can't stomach alllll their flavours in one go hah. My dairy-allergic friend loved their vegan selection and I couldn't help keep stealing some of hers too. Only downside was there is really limited seating in the store since I love ice cream in the winter.. but summer is soon upon us hopefully!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The first time I saw it, a friend and I had just had some ramen on Baldwin and she had mentioned an asian gelato shop in the area, we were disappointed to find it closed. However, all was redeemed when we finally got to try it the next time we were in the area. The flavours are so interesting and delicious! It's so hard to choose! Definitely check out their unique, smooth tasting gelato!"}
{"text":"Super popular gelato spot on Baldwin that specializes in Asian inspired flavours. You can get your delicious gelato in flavours such as Hong Kong milk tea, Vietnamese coffee, almond tofu, oolong tea, red bean white chocolate, and the like. You can have it served in either a cardboard cup or a sugar cone, but for 50 cents more, I highly recommend that you upgrade to a tasty waffle cone instead =)"}
{"text":"Amazing!! This is my second visit to Kekou and still amazing customer service, friendly and attentive staff. Despite the slightly long line up and small space they have, the staff there are very speedy in service, but at the same time does not rush you if you want to try all flavours before you decide. This takes away the pressure and stress for indecisive people like myself. The flavours they have are great. Whisky green tea is strong in both flavours and at the same time very well paired. Roasted Oolong has a pungent tea taste. Unfortunately, I was unable to try the Spicy Salted Pineapple which they did not have today, but maybe I'll save it for my 3rd visit. I bought 2 pints of gelatos today and the staff there, if I have not mentioned one too many times already, are GREAT! Although I was prepared for this and brought with me a cooler bag and ice packets (which they did not know as I kept it in my car), they added in a small bag of ice to keep it frozen without me even asking,  One small thing to add, they have complimentary self-serve lemon infused water on the side for customers for warm summer days like these or if you just want to wash the sugar off your pallet after you have enjoyed your choice of gelato.   I work in customer service and is a food lover, I can say that there is quality with the product and their staff. :)"}
