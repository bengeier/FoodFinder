{"text":"Will never go back here. For no apparent reason they removed all the tables while people were sitting at them and were very rude about it. It wasn't crowded and everyone just stood around with nowhere to put your drinks so no one ordered any more drinks and left."}
{"text":"Drinks were really good. Food was alright. Was promised lots of ass play by a celebrity but was sorely disappointed"}
{"text":"Came in with my office teammates for a quick happy hour. I immediate noticed how big and EMPTY the place was for a Wednesday 5pm happy hour. All the other establishments were busy! I used the ladies facilities and they were not clean. The toilets all needed to be flushed, some of doors did not lock and half the stalls did not have toilet paper and/or seat covers. Considering the amount of waitstaff on the floor and the lack of current business, the bathrooms should be spotless.  Gina was our server and promptly brought over waters for our table of 10. When asked for the wine list I was presented with a sticky menu offering 5 wines, all from the same average winery. I went with a beer. We ordered a few of the appetizer platters for the table. Food was average. Gina was attentive your cable throughout our short visit. We knew it was time to exit once the line dancing lessons started where it reminded me of a country Zumba class. A final note, what was most disturbing of the whole visit was the large hairball that was sitting on the windowsill behind our table! Seriously disgusted. Obviously I would not go back, nor what I recommend anyone make a point to visit.t"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I had the worst experience at this place last month. The steak was overdone, when my fiancée ordered dessert, the waitress just walked away without asking me if I wanted anything, and the waitress made my fiancée wait 15 minutes while talking to her friends before she even brought her dessert. I'm glad they closed."}
{"text":"Posting a few weeks late but I was so underwhelmed when I went to check out this place... Thought this would be a nice place to go out for dinner and drinks in a fun place. This place has the worst service I've experienced in a while. It was only open a few weeks so maybe they will get the act together later. Our server was nonexistent and ignored us while we were there. We had to ask the hostess or other servers when we needed something. We were there a little over an hour and it was not too busy. The drinks were cheep but small. Food was large portions but average bar food at best."}
{"text":"I thought cowboys were supposed to be southern gentleman? Not the case, as it turns out. Perhaps this is an unfair review, I've been once, and it was on a concert night. It was VERY crowded, which I usually wouldn't have too much of a problem with, except people were rude, pushy, and mildly violent. The music was pretty good, although I only knew half the songs. The waitresses really were doing their best given the crowd, and I'm sure they would be very good if there was a smaller crowd. Admittedly, I did have a good time and will likely try this place again on a regular night."}
{"text":"This is our second time in 5 years to Toby Keith's bar. I wanted to give it another chance. This time it still wasn't a place I would visit if I wanted a good meal. The atmosphere is cool, very big, good for a concert. But on a weds night with maybe 50 people in it it's seems deserted! Our waitress was very cute, but had no clue on that she was a waitress. She was concerned with flirting with the bar and male staffers. She's hanging out with her friends at another table as Im waiting for her to come back and get my payment for the bill she just left...maybe she is just giving me time to write this review. The food is decent, turkey melt is a 3 1/2 star. The burgers are a 2 star, it's big, but you can tell it's a frozen patty, dry, no flavor. Other than that if you go to the bathrooms don't be surprised if it might be dirty and no hand soap. With 20 or so staff you see there is little interest in the little details of a restaurant. If your coming here for a bar or night out.... You should have fun!"}
{"text":"They suck every time I've come here. Don't look cold because they will think you are drunk and not let you in. The douches who work the door think they are the shit. They are just college students who feel entitled to being the asshole door man."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say. Very disappointed. Went there when visiting Mesa for my sons birthday. Seemed like a fun place to eat. Everything is wrong here. Too long to be seated. Only ones at the door. Too long to receive service. Receive food. Got the order wrong. Overcharged the bill. Really not impressed will not come back again."}
{"text":"So we hit up Toby Keith's bar after dinner for a bachelorette party. My friend loves country so we thought this would be really appropriate. We walk in and it's Saturday night around 10:30pm and it was a little on the empty side which was a little surprising but obviously who cares, we came here to party! We go up to the bar and stand there for 15 mins before a bartender asks us if we want anything. Several bartenders were walking around not doing anything which got me a little irritated as well as my friends. We finally get our drinks which were pretty good at least. I'm not a big country fan but if you love country or want something different you should try this place. Definitely not my scene."}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like the only people on Yelp are the ones who write about how crappy everything is. Everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess, and this website is designed to be a forum for those types of reviews. However, you read some of the negative reviews about Tobys Keiths and they all point to the fact that the music is too loud and the crowd is too big!! Sorry folks...your old and not in the bar scene anymore because \"loud and crowded\" is what makes going out in the bar scene fun! Its called energy, palpable energy and it makes everyone else around have fun too!! The bartenders are gorgeous, you can drink beer out of a mason jar and rock to country music, and on special nights there is even other genres of music too!! Yes its a bar and grill, so review the food if you must. I have never had a bad thing yet by the way! But those who know about this place for more than food know they serve food to get a bigger and better liquor license to appeal to the bar scene, their main market!! If you wanna go out and have  a blast....try Tobys!! You will love this bar...and hopefully by the time you show up all of the negative Nellys have gone home so they can be in bed before 9pm!!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife said, \"Our Groupon is going to expire soon.  We gotta go.\"  I'd never heard of the place.  Went to Yelp to read the reviews.  They were mostly not flattering....many were terrible.  I knew I was going to hate the place.  In fact, I already hated it.  We arrived at 6pm and found tons of parking.  We were greeted by two hostesses who took us to a dining room booth that could easily hold 6-8 people.  Nice...lots of room.  Looked around..the place is huge...but very clean, nicely lit, and well kept.  Moments later, Kayla came by and took our drink orders.  Was prepared for crummy drinks because the reviews were quite negative about the bar.  Amazing...they were delicious and huge and cost 2 bucks.  Kayla explained the logic/purpose of the horizontal lines that circle the Red Solo Cups. So far...really good.  Ordered steaks, baked potatoes, beans, and broccoli.  One medium rare, one medium.  To our amazement, that's just what we got.  Great steaks, loaded potatoes with very tasty almond butter, delicious beans with pulled pork, and not overcooked broccoli.  Is this really the place where  all those nasty reviews live?  Couldn't be. Kayla dropped by a couple of times to see how we were doing.  When asked if Miranda and Blake were done, she was confident they would make it.  Kayla was attentive without being obtrusive, and got everything right. As we got up to leave, we agreed that \"TK's\" was much much better than expected and that we would certainly return.  We suspect the place is different on Saturday night vs. Wednesday evening...but if you are looking for a good meal during the week, Toby's is certainly worth considering.  Oh yeah... had to apologize to my wife for my rant all the way over to the restaurant about how she's got to read the reviews before she buys Groupons......Given our great experience, it's hard to know what happened to all those folks who were so disappointed.  Not us."}
{"text":"The place is huge, it's like eating in a warehouse.  Little to no atmosphere. The food was way overpriced, poorly prepared and just down right bad.  The \"Bloodmary bar\" consists of a few cans of tomatoe juice, pepper, a jar of olives and onions and a jug of clamato.  Would never go back and would only recommend to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"We'll come back when the waitresses and bartenders are more interested in their guests rather than flirting with each other. . .hire some older, more experienced employees. Food was ok. Drinks weak & pre-mixed, stick with beer. 2 stars for decor and location."}
{"text":"I have been to one other country bar in the East Valley and a few other bars that play different genres. Of the bars I've been to, this one is clearly my favorite and for a number of reasons.  1) The live music - they have famous country stars come and play here. To me, this is the only place in the area that has live country music from big name artists and it's only a $5 cover charge, which I find reasonable considering the price of concert tickets to see some of these people!  2) The bartenders - They are all friendly! Not only that but the waitress I talked to recommended a beer close to what I told her I liked, and she was dead on! It was perfect!   3)People watching - I love watching people. Particularly I've become fond of watching people dance, and especially to country music. It's not something I'm going to attempt being that I'm not very graceful to begin with, but I do love to watch other people do it. It makes me dizzy to even think about doing! I did happen to see an old man (70's probably) dancing with a lot of girls in their 20's and the girls weren't the usual stuck up girls that tend to hang out at bars and clubs. They danced with him and had a good time and laughed with him. He was a cool guy, and they seemed to be nicer than the average female these days.  4) The final thing was the patio area - it has it's own bar and while it's cash only and limited selection it's still a nice option to have if you want to hang out on the patio. We were able to easily find a seat. It's not only the only place you can smoke (even tho I don't the person I was with does) but it's the only place you can TALK.   All in all, I can assure you I'll be back. This place was awesome. People having fun without all the drama of a snobby place! The music, people, and atmosphere were awesome!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!! A large group of us went to toby's to watch the UFC fight. After about 2 1/2 hours and $200 the manager told us there was a 90 minute limit. The main event was just about to begin and we offered to buy more food so that we could stay. The manager was extremely rude, refused to let us stay and even cursed at us.There were several empty tables so we knew we weren't making other patrons wait.  We were never informed of the 90 minute limit.  The manager clearly doesn't care about his customers. Do yourself a favor and go to a restaurant that will appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ambiance good, Drinks were OK, Service no good. Bartender took a break and sat next to me at the bar, very unprofessional. Saw a female staff member take a \"to-go\" cup and fill it will the pre-made margarita. For High Street this place does not meet up to par. Left Toby Keith's talking to my friends about lack of service."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever seen we were ignored ...girl said she would talk to a manager and never did ...and I'm a  veteran ....we will not come back"}
{"text":"I went in to Toby Keith's with my manuscript  to do a bit of editing and to get out of the house.  I went at four o'clock, last Thursday and thought it was a really cool place.  I wasn't there for the evening, which is probably the time that it gets busiest and when the band gets going.  They were just practicing or setting up, they sounded great for the little while that they played.    I'll def go back some night with my boyfriend.  It's a pretty cool place with a relaxed and cool atmosphere.  It's not scottsdale pretentious but also not mesa lame.  Perfect combo."}
{"text":"I was sad to see that posted on the entrance was the sign, GUN FREE ZONE, GUNS NOT PERMITTED, this is just asking a criminal to go in and rob them, they know no one will shoot back. But it is their business and its my money, and I will spend it elsewhere."}
{"text":"The place is entertaining. I usually come here cause of the free ufc fights. Food is pretty good. I haven't had anything I didn't like just yet. We usually stay a little after the fights. I'm not very country (from Brooklyn ny) so we usually get some glares cause everyone is usually wearing cowboy hats, tight jeans, flannel button downs and huge belt buckles. It's an ok place every now n then. But a great place to watch the ufc fights."}
{"text":"We had an office party of 25 people at Toby Keith's this past Friday.  The service was ABHORENT!  Absolutely the stupidest and rudest wait staff I have ever experienced.  First, they would not seat us until 10 of our party had arrived, so we literally loitered around the hostess podium for close to 20 minutes.  Drink orders were not taken or even offered.  When we were finally able to convince the seating Nazi to get us to our table (it was before 5pm, and there were maybe four other tables occupied in the dining room) they led us to a looooooong table that streched over 20 feet and was being blasted with afternoon sun.  When we asked the waitress if she could put down the shades she said, oh the sun will go down in a little while.  My boss was not impressed and immediately took it upon herself to start rearranging the tables, since asking the staff for help was like talking to a car bumper.  A crowd of waitresses with looks of \"Um...oh my gawd!\" stood around and watched us as we moved the tables our selves to accomodate better conversation.  No one offered to help, or even get the manager.  And when the spikey-haired Restaurant and Hotel Management Flunkie did finally show up, we had to literally point out that look, we are going to be drinking and eating all night, with 25 people!  How about a little service to warrent the $1,400.00 tab (which is what it came to, not to mention the additional $700 that was dropped in drinks later in the evening).  We had a good time, but our group could have a good time on a park bench.  The people-watching once the evening crowd showed up was a sight to behold.  Everything from real bone fide cowboys to Country-Fried Cougars to your usual douche bags and trollips of the Valley bar scene.  The food was meh--think county fair meets Cirle K in terms of fried fat content--I would have liked to have tried the Deep Fried Twinkie.  The Texas Tea, which is basically like a Long Island Iced Tea with Shiner Bock instead of Coke, was decidedly watered down.  Or I'm an alcoholic and and drinking paint-thinner doesn't phase me.  I wouldn't EVER go back.  This place couldn't be any more corporate, which is especially sad since the service is so poorly executed."}
{"text":"Ya great atmosphere.....food not so much. I personally could go down to the Walmart across the street and get the same garbage they serve here. I had chicken strips and I think I would have enjoyed McDonald's better. Their BBQ sauce wow?! The hell made that sauce it was horrible!   Unfortunately my wife enjoyed the place and wants to go back so we can dance and listen to the bands."}
{"text":"Came in to have a welcome home party for a friend returning from overseas. After ordering our first drink, which we never got to drink, starting the process to reserve VIP tables, ect we found out that my ex worked there that I haven't spoken to in over 3 years. We were promptly kicked out for \"being a problem and making his bouncer uncomfortable\". I really didn't care if he was there and we had to make last minute party arrangements for our friend that finally made it home safe. I have to say, I have never dealt with a more unprofessional group of people. So much for being about the troops."}
{"text":"For being so patriotic and the \"All American\" that TK portrays himself to be, it's a wonder that I Love This Bar & Grill can tout they are a love of...well, anyone's. Went to see Rev. Horton Heat (which was quite great) here on Thursday which is why I give it the 2nd star. However, I was shocked to discover that PBR's were $5 a can and a well rum and diet was an eye-popping $8! I cannot judge the food...nor will I ever...as I will not return to this establishment ever again. From the looks of it, the food resembled Applebee's, the bartender didn't seem to know his a$# from a hole in the ground and the prices kept fluctuating throughout the night. Bad service, bad drink prices, Good entertainment (bonus) but overall rip-off."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now and we've had the barbecue ribs both times. They are fantastic. My coleslaw and mashed potatoes were also very good. The water has a bad taste and we mentioned it to our waitress and she gave us iced teas at no charge."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!!!!! And I am not just saying that, I also work in the service industry! I waited 30 mins at the bar FOR A FREAKING beer!!!! Finally got the bartenders attention and he was a complete dick to me and saying how he's trying to service all these people, in that area of the bar, not my problem! Hire more bartenders so you can accommodate all of your customers!!! So then I tried asking one of the servers that came up to the bar if she could help me get my beer and she was so completely rude! Her response was to go down to the other end where there were more bartenders. Excuse me?! So I finally see a manager and told him what happened and made sure he knew how rediculous it was that the customers are being treated like that. And he sent a different bartender over to me, and I got my beer. Finally. I will never ever be back, and neither will the other two friends that I was with and all three of us will make sure to spread the word to everyone we know.   :)"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Been there a few times and it has sucked every time. Wait staff is rude and slow. Food quality is poor. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I will never go to this bar again.   First off, I bought tickets for my wife and I , and one friend to go and see the Chris Young concert.  My wife is a huge fan and was looking forward to going to this concert.  I was told when I called to show up around five, because it was standing room only.  We showed up and had a few drinks and ate, and around eight o'clock headed towards the North side close to the stage.  I had a friend who showed up, so I went to meet him at the door. When I came back, my wife was thrown out. When I asked what happened, they told me a guy had been pushing on her when I left.  She asked him to stop several times and he didn't and he said something offensive to her, so she threw her drink in his face.   I was irritated because when I went outside the bouncer was pushing her, so I told him to back off.  He then decided to push me and call his friends to join in.  I was angry, because they were pushing my wife around who weighs 120 pounds, and the six foot fool who had been pushing her was allowed to stay in the concert.  We basically missed the whole Chris Young Concert.  Anyways, I will never go back, or will I recommend anyone else go there.  I only hope Toby Keith gets word of the kind of men he has as bouncers at his place.  Real manly men, pushing around a 120lb lady.  I am sure he would be ashame of them.  Real cowboys don't push women.   I hope they are proud of themselves!!!!"}
{"text":"Should've listened to the Yelp reviews on this one...  Toby Keith, I Hate your Bar & Grill.     The food?  Meh.  Nothing to get excited about. We started with the appetizer sampler which consisted of \"nachos\" (chips, 2 spoonfuls of cheez whiz and jalapenos), dry and small chicken wings, freezer-burned poppers, and fried pickles.  Our entrees weren't much better.  The southern fried chicken wasn't very southern and the country gravy was OK, but cold.  The steak sandwiches were fatty....  it just wasn't good.  What blew our minds was the service.  We sat on the patio and our server clearly forgot about us as she completely disappeared for a solid 40 minutes.  I finally went inside to order drinks from the bar, noted we ordered these drinks awhile ago and didn't want to be double charged since we hadn't received them.  The Bartender was nice, but she must've said something to our server because from that point on...  HOLY ATTITUDE for the rest of our meal, it was pretty uncomfortable!    I'M SORRY...  I am the customer, you disappeared and now you're taking it out on us because...?     To top it all off, we were given a bill with the total amount due, nothing else.  Not itemized, no explanation as to why 4 people were being charged $197.00....  I'm guessing those drinks were double or triple charged after all...    Wanted to like this place since we had a pretty good time at the Vegas location, but that's Vegas & who doesn't have fun there?  STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOURIST TRAP HELLHOLE."}
{"text":"!!! CLOSED !!!!  Love this Bar? Well for the landlords at High Street, not so much.  It looks like Toby Keith's had its last line dance.  Earlier today the owner of the property at High Street SKB took possession of all of the assets based on a sign posted on the doors and windows.  The door locks have been changed and the place is shutdown.  This is really too bad as it took them over a year to get up and running and they didn't even make it six months."}
{"text":"I've hear that Toby Keith's song about his bar says something like \"never a cover charge\". On Wednesday night there was a $5 cover charge for guys. Then the door people handed me a card saying that there were $1 domestic beers for guys until 10pm. So we went to the bar and, after some delay, the bartender asked me, \"Would you like a short one or a tall one?\" I said a tall one, so he brings me a 32oz. mason jar with Blue Moon (a domestic) with a slice of orange. He said, \"That'll be $9.\" Some other guy later on that night said he also got ripped off that way, too. Even the ladies were paying a lot for alcohol, $7.50 for shots of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey. The place was pretty dead except for our party. The sound system was good, although too loud and we did get some dancing in."}
{"text":"NO I WILL NOT BE GIVING YOU MORE MONEY.  I plan events for a living and when I go to a website, I expect for the website to be completely up-to-date with ACCURATE information.  It is very important, especially for those who are looking for venues to hold private parties to give every last DETAIL online. So naturally, when a website says \"Now there is NO ROOM fees to book one of our private barns or VIP rooms\" - I do not expect someone on the other line to tell me they are $75/hour or $200 an hour depending on which room we reserve.  Not only did I waste 20 minutes of my time today, but I will not be planning an event at Toby Keith's...ever."}
{"text":"It didn't bother me a lot at first, but the more I think about it, the more unsatisfied I am with our experience here.  We went with a group of about 10 or so people.  It was pretty empty in there, so it wasn't very loud, which was nice.  It was so dark, we had to use our cell phones to see the menu.  No biggie.  There was a large menu with a good variety of eats.  We went with the nachos which were pretty good, although, I don't think pulled pork really goes with nachos.  Anyway, the website advertised $1 draft beer and $1 SoCo Limes.  When we got there around 7:15, we learned that the \"$1 beers\" didn't start until 8, so the ones that couldn't wait ordered the $7 Mason jar beers.  At 8, we ordered the $1 beers (Bud Light, Miller Light and Coors Lite only) and got one or maybe 2 rounds for some of those.  The server then told us that there was no longer $1 drafts, but $3 Mason jars.  She also said that there were not $1 SoCo Limes.  After a little convincing, she did give us one round of $1 Soco Limes served in big plastic cups.  After asking, they did start the mechanical bull for a few guys in our group.  He was cool and even let them each go twice.  At the end, she did not know what anyone had ordered, so we had to try to remember everything we ate and drank.  Seemed kind of disorganized."}
{"text":"There's something so amazing about drinking beer from a mason jar! The beer is decently priced and the food is delicious. The seasoned fries and sweet potato fries compliment their burgers perfectly. I also love the live music and the fact that everyone seems at home here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even linen on the dining tables for dinner. You don't see that in casual restaurants anymore.  The food was good and plentiful. Ordered chicken fried steak and BBQ ribs. The band hadn't started yet but the bar and dance area looked like fun. I'm so happy to have this place in my neighborhood.  My suggestion, train the servers on attentiveness and, when you serve ribs, provide a better napkin. Other than that, good experience. I'm so happy to have this place in my neighborhood, I really hope they get better about their service standards. Never saw a manager around."}
{"text":"Better to try Cracker Barrell for the chicken fried steak. Thin and flavorless. We tried 2 of their 'specialty cocktails'. Both watered down. Too bad I can't get my $60 back....."}
{"text":"Ugh, where do I start Toby? All I can say is stick to your day job... This bar is not well thought out. The bar is LONG and big. Kind of like a convention hall where you might have a concert. There's a stage with music at the front of the narrow end. Unfortunately because of the long and narrow layout of the bar, the back of the bar is empty. There are tables for seating ALL the way at the back but I doubt this would be a place that anyone would think to go grab a bite to eat. The bright lighting also does not make this the most inviting place for a meal or a bar... A lot of bright spot light yellow patches.   Other than the poor layout, when I gave the bartender a $20 for my beer, she took the money to the register, got my change, got distracted and just never came back to hand me the money. She just kinda walked around and pocketed it. At least get me drunk before doing that!  The crowd looks dirty. Not dirty in the sense of nasty people but just dirty like they need a shower. Girls, stockings with short shorts, boots and a hunting cap is surprisingly not that attractive.   Some tips: ADHD medication for the bartenders, renovation of the space itself, some minimal dress code and maybe hire a renown chef to get the food part of the business going."}
{"text":"I normally love the ambience of this place and the beautiful layout of the bar.  Food is OK, but the fried bologna sandwich is excellent.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I went in there last Saturday over Memorial Day weekend, sat at the bar, and ordered a glass of white wine to go with my lunch.  The bar didn't have ANY white wine - no chardonnay, no sauvignon blanc, no pinot grigio - nothing.  What kind of bar doesn't have white wine on a holiday weekend?  They need to do some inventory control.  No wonder the place was deserted."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted an hour of my life that I can NEVER get back. Started with our server Lara who took forever to even take our drink order. Once she returned with the incorrect drink she said oh we don't serve that even though it is on the menu. Should have gotten a clue then but, we decided to give them a chance. Wrong, should have left while the getting was good.   The food was terrible and the staff was to busy playing grab ass to care about the customers. The management was non existent. Requested to see the manager and he never showed up. I guess customer service is not a part of the business set up here.  If you want a bad server, terrible food, and no service then this is the place for you. Obviously this restaurant, if you can even call it that, is just a tax write off for Toby. This place needs an overhaul quickly. My guess, closed in less than a year. I will not be recommending this place to anyone. Wish I could give it no stars!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Saturday and had a horrible experience. There was some kind of school band demo going on which would have been fine except it was unnecessarily and extremely loud!  We seated ourselves and didn't even get acknowledged for at least ten minutes. We finally got drinks and menus and another ten minutes passed without anyone coming to take our order. And the problem wasn't that they were busy as 95% of the tables were empty. And there were waitresses there but none seemed to be serving customers. While we were there waiting at least three other parties got up and left which is what we finally did as well.   Toby Keith should ashamed to have his name on this place!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN  will I ever go back to this place. The security staff are a bunch of rude douche bags that feel the need to push and shove women out when it's time to close. WHEN THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE INSIDE. We were there early and had to pay $5 because \"national act\" was performing. Why come up to people that have been there and ask to pay but whatever. It was the most horrible experience and it was mostly the security's fault. Don't go there if you have a group of people and just want to have fun. They apparently don't condone that."}
{"text":"We went here for the Thompson Square concert and it was a terrible experience. First, we get in the line that is closest to the parking lot and we are told that if we have already bought tickets to go to the line in the front of the building. This line was twice as long and then they tell us that they are backed up so we have to continue to wait.   Doors opened up at 7pm and the show was scheduled to start at 9pm, we got there around 8pm, show started at 10:30. The opening band was pretty good except for the fact that in the 2 hours we waited for the show to start, they played the same songs at least 3 times. Once Thompson Squared finally started to play the sound was terrible, there was feedback, reverb, and the audio quality was poor. They had a live feed on the TV which looked like a camera pointed at a lightbulb with some people standing in front of it.   The service at the bar was terrible it is most likely a good idea to have more than 5 bartenders trying to serve as many people as that place holds. The only saving grace was the fact that the drinks were pretty strong when you could get the right drink. The waitress brought us the wrong drink mix and she was like well it is kind of the same thing. The air conditioning was either off or not powerful enough to cool the entire place because it was so hot that everyone was sweating and since it was so crowded this meant that you were going to swap sweat with a lot of people, most of them people who dress for the bar but most likely have never touched a farm or even a horse.   I wanted to go see the upcoming Chris Young and David Allen Coe concerts here. However, because of this experience, not only will I not be attending those concerts, I will not be going back to this bar and I am embarassed that I asked people to go see Thompson Square and encouraged them to attend this event. One of the worst experiences that I have had in a single environment."}
{"text":"The dance floor is terrible here. its new but its not polished. The band tonight started almost 50 minutes late. The music prior to the band starting was poorly chosen as well. The band was awful they could not stay on tempo. The choices of songs were very poor.  Not good dance music!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review with a caveat, I am in no way into most country music. It was a whim to stop in and tip a few back, but I am very glad I went. First off, my hat goes off to whoever is he hiring manager here, holy smokes, the wait staff have two or three basic 'types' - all beautiful - ALL. First, there is a strong blond, 'Cali girl' contingent of ladies with names like Brittani, then secondly, the gorgeous, and almost alwayz shorter, binging brunettes. My poor female tracking system soon went into overload, and I believe I saw smoke curling from my ears, and I hadn't even started drinking yet.  Ah yes, drinking, knew there was a reason to stop in. I wound up having the Redbull n Vodka house specials, nicely prepared, fast service, the night was definitely looking up. Entertainment, on the night I dropped by, consisted of a ring and wrestlers from a local 'league' called EXW, or Extreme Wresting Something or another. Not being a huge fan of fake fighting, I didn't spend a lot of time watching the fights or listening to the \"Oh, You may have beaten me but you cheated\" spiel that seems standard. On the other hand, the matches were short and although the crowd was obviously into the scene, yelling for the good guy(s) and hassling the bad, the bar would have been a much less popular hangout. Personally, I spent more time telling the wait staff stoopid bar jokes than I spent watching the match either in person or on the many big screens. Food, didn't order any grub this time around, but I did ask and a few of the patrons were very happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Ok... if you reading this still go but the owners where not ready for the cubs game after math (NO SURE WHY) the poor serve seemed to be doing everthing but she was nice after she realized she hah us waiting for just our menu and waters.... The place was getting packed FAST! we wanted to stay bc the drink and food are great but left to cactus moon after we request for our bill after done eating. But will go back bc its chill good place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the live music and the burgers are really good. Would definitely recommend coming here and trying it out."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh worse service ever!! Mandy and Courtney are horrible managers and I will take this issue as far as I can go! Karma."}
{"text":"Problem 1, the server was hired because she is cute, but not at all a good server. 2.She couldn't tell us what beer is on tap and she joked about that. 3.Never brought us silverware even though we asked twice. My husband just got it from bar. 4.Brought me wrong drink. 5.Our meals were terrible. My son's ribs were so fatty and the meat was so tough he only ate a bit and felt sick for hours later. Just overall bad experience. Food and staff needs revamping. Where's management? Does Toby Keith even care about his restaurants?"}
{"text":"The only positive thing about this place is seeing the country singers perform. The staff is extremely pretentious and rude. I went to the Easton Corbin concert and was extremely disappointed with the way I was treated, there is no excuse and these people should be fired. I will never go back and you shouldn't  go either."}
{"text":"As much as we wanted to love this bar, it was hard to.  The minute we walked in we received poor service and it was dead in there.  Our utensils were dirty and the food was average.  One good thing was our server did a great job.  We were looking forward to the experience but it wasn't worth our time."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Once for lunch during the weekday (sat at the bar), the other on the weekend at lunch time (sat at a table.) Both times were horrible! The service is horrific...it takes about 10 minutes for them to notice you and the food takes forever as well. Even when i ate there both times, there was barely anyone in the restaurant so i don't see why they were so slow. I am not going back here because of the slow service for mediocre food, although they have great bbq sauce in their store available for purchase (gluten-free), otherwise not worth waiting around."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Toby's.  I'm a country music fan so I suppose I'm a bit biased, but in addition to good tunes their food is genuinely good too.   Always had good service here too whether it was for lunch, happy hour or my birthday shindig which I had here a couple years ago.  My only word of warning is watch out if you are going for a show.  Saw Justin Moore there and it was quite possibly the drunkest group of people I've ever seen in my life.  It got a bit annoying at the end of the night, so have a plan B in place if you can't take that many drunkards in one night.  I also love that you can drink beer out of a mason jar, how fun is that?!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  The music is bad, drinks are overpriced, and the people want to be country, but live in the city."}
{"text":"We decided to try the new location in City North on Sunday afternoon, 12:30 p.m.  I would advise against this!  Since this is a popular music/night spot, they run a skeleton crew on Sunday.  They really shouldn't even offer lunch!  There was one waiter for about ten tables when we arrived and it took us over 20 minutes to even order our food, after waiting for ten minutes for our drinks to be delivered.  There was a sign in the restrooms reminding us that the attendant works for tips only, however, there was no attendant and no hand dryer or paper towels.  When I mentioned this to one of the hostesses, she gave me a blank look and said, \"Oh, sorry about that!\"  But, nothing was done about it!  No towels in either bathroom!  There were five of us in our party and we all used the restroom while we were there and no action was taken even after mentioning it a second time!  Food was so-so and we will probably not return to this restaurant.  We did tip our waiter well as he was doing the best he could as the only one available to the entire restaurant!"}
{"text":"First and last time trying out on 7-20-2015. Rude, uninterested staff. Be careful to express anything to them. They will accuse you of being drunk after having almost one beer and physically push you out the door gestopo style. Then, laugh at and ridicule you through the window. So much for trying to have a drink with your family!!! Hands down, worst experience for all of us.  Save your time and money. Should have yelped it first. Be forewarned and believe every negative review out there."}
{"text":"I don't usually get on these internet sites and complain about things, but this is a must! This is the worst bar I have ever been to in my entire life! horrid food, over priced drinks, too loud to the point you can't even enjoy yourself, and the RUDEST bunch of people I have ever encountered. How they stay in business will forever boggle me."}
{"text":"I have only been one time and I am not the biggest country fan.  But the bar is great and I had a good time.  However, it was empty though I hear it gets pretty packed when a big name country star/band plays there."}
{"text":"I was hoping this was going to be Great. but right off the bat as we were being seated we asked for a booth (there was only 2 of us) we were told  we could not have a booth because it was busy. it was only half  full. after we were seated  we noticed many couples  being seated at a booth.                the food was Average and side portions are tiny.  my wife asked for a side salad and  did not get the salad till just Before she brought us the check"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting more of a \"country\" bar feel but this place is pretty modern.   Food was good - I couldn't bring myself to try the fried bologna sandwich though - and the beer is served in red solo cups.  Appropriate.  Would love to go back on a busy Friday or Saturday night to see what it's like when it's busy and hear some live music."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, a giant guitar shaped bar, food is overpriced for the portion sizes though. The food was pretty good the first time I ate here but a complete disappointment the second time around. I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner, I brought my family and we didn't order anything fancy, for four people about $80 or more and the food was bad and we left hungry...the steak sandwich was sooooo bad and chewy! I was so embarrassed I took my parents here."}
{"text":"Toby Keith Bar & Grill, where shall I start?   It's my kind of place, just walking through the front door puts a bit smile on my face. It ain't too far, come as you are, I love this bar.  If you know these lyrics, then you will most likely enjoy this bar just as I do.  There is good country music playing, large beers served in a mason jar, and did I mentioned the deep fried Twinkies? There is plenty of room, an nice little outdoor patio, decent country crowd, and lots of 2-steppers getting down on the dance-floor.  The drawbacks? I would have given a solid five stars if not for the way the rude bouncers started kicking us out when it got close to 2am. I am not used to being treated that way, and I could not believe that is how management has their bouncers treat their customers. That did really leave a bad taste in my mouth, but I still have love for Toby Keiths. I will come back every chance I get!  Tip- Toby's has pretty good concerts. Check out the website to find any upcoming performances!"}
{"text":"I'm a big country fan..so  I love the live country music and dance floor!!  The bar is in the middle of the place and is gigantic!  The food is pretty good too....last night I have the house smoked chicken sandwich...nothing super special, but pretty good.  Just a nice casual, fun country kind of hang out!!!!  The crowd is a mix of old cowboys and young people.....this is one of the few places in the Mesa Riverview I enjoy going to..."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and the place was  a ghost town. We were just there for drink sand ordered vodka sodas with lime. The bartender was nice but went MIA often. The club soda tasted very strange, almost sweet. Our drinks were served in red plastic cups while the couple next to us got glass...not sure what that was all about.  The particular day I was there it was FREEZING inside while it was in the 90's outside. The barely clothed bartender told us she is NOT ALLOWED to wear a jacket over her uniform.  This repulsed me as I see who I assume was the manager (a big, buff, tattooed guy) strutting around the restaurant.  Places that put sexuality before employee comfort disgust me."}
{"text":"Not my thing...food wasn't great and the location is out of the way...also had a $5 cover..not worth it"}
{"text":"Had a great time here. much larger than i expected it to be. went on a week night and it was dead (although its summer in az so thats expected) but the weekends were packed and the live music rocked! of course i wasnt drunk enough yet, but there was even quite a bit of line dancing going on. Had deals on kiltlifter when I was there, but I'm yet to order food.."}
{"text":"We went to Toby keiths this past Saturday night and definitely found the new go to spot.  The drinks were good prices considering other bars in the area.  The only reason why its not 5 stars is because it was pretty hot in the building.  Other than that it was a great mix of people and the live band was good."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all. Went here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend and old college roomie, both country fans. I thought I was going to feel out of place since I'm a short little Asian girl (I probably looked like a foreign exchange student with my two country-Caucasian buddies in tow), but I didn't. The lunchtime crowd on this particular weekend seemed mellow, which was nice. Unfortunately, I had major dental work done a few days earlier and was still on a soft diet, but I still managed to order fried macaroni and cheese (YUMMY!) and mashed potatoes (could use a little more butter, but still very good). The only disappointment was the fried okra, I wasn't a fan of how it was fried (it's not the same as good ol' down south okra). My boyfriend and friend both had tortilla soup which they loved, and they said the grilled cheese was delicious as well. There were so many choices on the menu though, which is probably why I will have to come back and try it again! =)   As far as the service, one of the busboys seemed like he was in a daze and didn't know who to deliver food orders too, and our server was very slow with the check, but it was still a good experience. You could tell that this place is definitely a party place at night, thought! I will have to come back and see what that's like."}
{"text":"I may love this bar, but I DO NOT love this grill.  We went for lunch on a Sunday because we happened to be next door at Bass Pro. The service was great, food arrived in a reasonable manner, but the food itself was terrible.  I ordered chicken fried steak (this is a country, place, right?). Received a frozen patty with congealed gravy on top, some burnt corn on the cob and bland mashed potatoes. My son's chicken quesadilla was missing cheese, other son's pulled pork sliders were slimy and disgusting, and hubby's sliders were over-cooked little hockey pucks. None of us was able to finish our meal.   My advice, great bar, but definitely eat before you go."}
{"text":"Waitress was kind enough to visit on rare occasion, customer service in general sucks....Nick Nicholson was the only good reason to stay in the building and the only reason I would bother to return."}
{"text":"F. this S. d*ckout uh-m'rikah"}
{"text":"I'm a rocker by nature but have an affinity for country music and the honky tonk scene.  Checked this place out with a couple friends just out of curiosity.  The place is huge!  Interesting mix of people, not just country lovers which was cool.  They really pack in the people though which after getting bumped into several times can get annoying depending on who's doing the bumping if you know what i mean.  Next time I wouldn't mind renting a cabana just to have a little personal space to retreat to if needed.  I had a decent burger with fries.  Food was middle of the road.  Nothing special.  Had more fun people watching then anything."}
{"text":"I need to give this place 4 different reviews. One star for the fact that it took over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us when we sat at the bar. 4 stars for the bartender who actually took care of us even though we were not in his \"section.\" 5 stars for the drinks and fried pickles, and five stars for the concerts. It was amazing to watch how the service changed drastically when the bartender realized that I tip well and after each round of drinks. The rest of the night my drinks were amazing and the service was impecable.   When you sit at the bar one of the three bartenders should at least acknowledge you. It is really sad to see them look up and walk the opposite way like you are not worth their time. If they didn't have such great concerts for so cheap I probably wouldn't go. While the fried pickles are awesome, they are not worth bad service.   I have had dinner here once, and it was okay. Nothing memorable and the service was slow at a regular table but not like at the bar where we were completly ignored."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to dine out if you enjoy country music, drinking out of mason jars and Applebees-style food. OK, so I only enjoy the first two, and while we had a good time here, it was just an average sort of experience.  I went with two of my friends who dig these types of places and we were stunned at the enormity of the place. Of course we stopped to pause at the KNIX/Buck Owens memorabilia, while we killed an hour with our Applebees-style buzzer -- and then checked out Bass Pro Shop next door.  No one was really wowed by the food. In fact my chile chicken sandwich was incredibly hot -- so much so that I had to scrape the Hatch chile seeds from off the chicken breast -- ONLY recommended if you like it REALLY spicy. The Toby's Platter was average.. if only memorable for the odd mac/cheese wedges, that were a bit too dry.  Service was ok, but our server did bring out the entrees before our appetizer... not sure how/why that happened. But they quickly took the entrees away and brought our Toby's Platter appetizer to us quickly. I hope we got new entrees!!! One thing I did like -- they didn't bat an eye when we ordered celebratory shots... and why would they? This is a hard partying Toby Keith roadhouse!!!"}
{"text":"Tk is a solid spot. As of this review its a brand new bar -- opened a week ago -- with that come growing pains. Ignore the haters.  Haters should check their nancy cards at the door.  There is one previous 1-star reviewer that called his girlfriend his \"beloved\" and brought his family here. To him I say, SIR! This isn't Toby McGuires bar and this is not pleasantville. Don't take that guys advice.  Our food was good and came out surprisingly quick, bartender was down to earth, the crowd was a fine. Shout to Joanna.  No draft beer until next week... That's definitely a bummer for now. Again, these things aren't easy to open. Be eeeeeeeeasy people."}
{"text":"Oh no, I have apparently become a regular here!  So, I am from the middle of nowhere, where the definition of dressing up to go out entails putting on your cutest plaid shirt, jeans and boots.  I think this may be why I kinda like Toby's; it reminds me of back home.  The inside feels like a large barn with a bar in the middle, and a band playing live music on a stage.  The staff is nice to look at and generally pretty swift at getting anything you need.    The clientele has become variable.  I almost wonder if the band playing almost determines the turnout of the kind of patrons at Toby's.  Some white trash mixed with some true country folk and for some reason lately random hipsters and rockabilly guys and gals end up in here too???    In all honesty, I think I am still swooning from the first time I stepped into Toby's.  I met two of the finest cowboys I have ever met in my life, and they turned me out on the dance floor.  It is amazing how important first impressions are..Maybe I just keep going back in hopes of such a grand night out of beer, tequila and cowboys, but it usually ends up rather anticlimactic."}
{"text":"Other than the overly expensive food and the hit and miss service, my biggest beef with this establishment is their bouncers. The past two times I went I've had problems with the bouncers. I went into the bathroom and I didn't have a wristband on. The bouncer questioned me about my age, which I understood why. He also told me that when I get out there to get a wristband, which was vague. I went to the bar and expected someone to come around and check my I.D. Later when I went out to get a smoke, the same bouncer stopped me. He made me follow him outside the bar. When we got there began to rudely question me. He asked me \"didn't I tell you to get a wristband?\" to which I responded \"Yes, but I was waiting for the guy to come around to check my I.D, they do go around and check I.Ds, don't they?\" To which he told me they did. When he said to get a wristband out there, I thought he meant in the bar. That whole night 3 or 4 people in my group didn't have a wristband the whole night. The second event that made me write this review, happened tonight. I went outside to have a smoke, and when I tried to enter again, they refused to let me in. They said that I was intoxicated, though I hadn't had a single drink that night. The bouncer claimed that I smelled like alcohol, which had to be a blatant lie. After trying constantly to convince them that I was sober, I gave up and had my sister come outside to talk to them. They continued to make false claims about me, claiming that I was stumbling and other ridiculous things. When we asked to speak to the person who was making these claims, they changed their mind and decided to let me in. Last time I spend money at this place."}
{"text":"Huge warehouse like bar and grill with strange Djs that play country along with hip hop and rap tracks to throw everyone off. The funny thing is that most people are dancing to the twerk songs rather than the 2 step! Its an average bar with average food and average girls."}
{"text":"Horrible experience it took forever for me to even get served then the female bartender never came back for over half an hour  I was gonna stay and check it out but after that I decided to leave and after waiting longer for her to notice my empty glass I decided to go to the end of the bar myself and pay and she comes up gets other peoples drinks in front of me and leaves and doesn't stop to think hmmm I wonder y that customer got up from her seat and came down to the cashiers end of the bar????? Hmmmm??!! I really wonder So I am forced to complain to the other customer standing next to me looking for her waitress and ultimately complained to the only server bar person I could find then she says to the bartender \"can u take care of her?\" Wow ???  ain't never going back and NO, I DONT love this bar!!"}
{"text":"Good looking wait staff, big place.  Beer overpriced.  Sound system substandard.  Video system poor.  Oversold venue full of plaid western shirt wearing children.  Don't believe I'll return.  Sorry Toby, your joint sucks."}
{"text":"Done well for what it is. The cover band that plays at 9 on weekends is not bad at all. Watching couples 2 step out on the dance floor is great fun especially if there are people taking it way too serious... Which there were. I'm not really into the pop country vibe but I still had a good time on the dancefloor spinning some ladies around amidst a sea of bobbing cowboy hats.   The mason jar 32oz beer is a nice touch."}
{"text":"We just left and were the only 4 people in the joint. Kayla was amazing she was incredible! Best service Iv ever had for only being 4 people in the whole place. If that was me I'd be just pissed but she handled it with pure class! If I was the owner or manager of that place she would go straight to the top for getting a promotion. I will be back only because of the friendly service we all received from Kayla! Great job!"}
{"text":"This is just a bad chain bar.  Went on three different occassions with large parties over the course of a year and service was the most consistently unfriendly we have seen.  We all love courntry music and the quality of the music was a big plus but the far below average food and uppity wait staff just make it a not enjoyable environment.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ended up watching Calvin Johnson set the receiving record. Ok, had the turkey club, you need a seriously big mouth to try and take a bite of this. It was very good, could only eat half, the fries were great. I sat at the bar and some of the girls behind the bar have serious bitch attitude. If you don't like your job go work someplace where you don't have to deal with the public, maybe they were having a bad night the rest of the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm hoping my experience was poor because we went in the evening (close to bar party time for them) and not an everyday occurrence.   The food was sub part at best. I ordered a turkey wrap and it was soggy like it was premade and sitting there. The macaroni I got on the side was obviously siting under a heat lamp. When I go to a restaurant like this I expect made to order food, not the pretense of a left over.   The service was ok but when I asked of they had bread or chips and salsa to bring out before the appetizer she looked at me like I was an idiot and said \"well...I mean I can bring you small crackers.\"  I don't need to be treated like an idiot for asking for something a lot restaurants have as a customary courtesy.   Won't be returning. No buenos in my book."}
{"text":"went again a 8 days ago. Had awful slow service. The Nachos were weird and we sent them back. They actually don't know how to cook at this place when you figure that to make nachoes they pour a tortilla soup over the chips and toss extra cheese on it. They don't make nachoes with ground beef at all, they can't make them w/o beans because thats part of the smoked chicked tortilla soup they pour on the chips!  The cheese fries were good.  The drinks all start at $5 at the bar except for the beer.  But my biggest issue with the bar that is making me fall down stars is that I gave them my credit card for my drinks. And Eight days, soon to be nine I am still being charged my drink prices plus and additional $20 that they intially ran an authorization on my card for! I have spoken to their management about it and it still is not cleared! I have left messages which have gone unreturned.  Tomorrow I am going in and kick some country ass and have all charges reversed for the inconvience.  My only question now is this....Who got the bail money?"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Toby Keith or even a cowboy, well I'm a CFH, but thats besides the point, this place is tolerable. I have gone here a couple times, either before or after a movie at the cinemark theatre. And the beer was reasonably priced. I believe I paid 3 bones for a pint of Sierra Nevada or some kind of pale ale. Didn't have any food so can't help anyone out there. They atmosphere is relaxed, with a huge bar circular bar right in the middle. On the west side of the bar is the area where you can sit down at a table or booth and have lunch or dinner. I saw a reatil store selling everything Toby Kieth. Then over to the east part of the bar there is a stage and a couple of barn looking things with some couches and comfy chairs inside that I lounged on for a couple of minutes. They also had a lush looking room behind some glass that looked like it can be used for meetings or private partys. Even have a mechanical bull, but that seems to be the new trend everywhere these days. Ok, so what I didn't like about this place. Its rather bright in their, granted the times I've been here have been during the daytime, The bartender chick acted like she was all that and wasn't really all that. Also, she came off like we were interupting her, like it was inconvinience to serve us and do her job. Lastly, all they played was shit kicker music. Now I know its a country place, but it even sounded like it was the same artist every song. So I started thinking all the played was Toby's music, I went up to the hostess and asked her if all they played was Toby Keith's music? She enlightned me that was not true but they played the same playlist over and over again all day long. When asked how many times a day would she hear the same song, she told me about 8 to 9 times. Thats almost inhumane. Torture and felt sad and sorry for those employees. I know I wouldn't be able to stomach that day in and day out.  So overall, if you dig country and that kinda lifestyle then you will go ape shit for this place. But if you don't, its still adaquate."}
{"text":"This place kinda sux! My boyfriend & I only went because of an event taking place there...  The servers & hostesses to me seemed kinda rude, our waiter was ok, maybe because he was a dude? We ordered the chicken fried steak, which was way salty (maybe because the gravy?), the gravy was so-so, the mashed potatoes were kinda dry, the corn was overcooked, the cornbread was good. The women's restroom wasn't too clean either. (I don't mean the usual mes from having a busy night - I mean like eek-level) We both got upset stomachs after eating here too  & I don't have a sensitive stomach at all. Actually landed me indisposed in the bathroom for a day. The only thing on par was the beer, which was Bud Light in the bottle. I could see how this would be a fun place if you're going for an event however..."}
{"text":"I love this bar.. So much fun! Everyone is so chill and just wants to have a good time. Id choose this over old town anyday!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this bar since the day it opened and used to love this place.  I'm a big country fan and love the crowd that it use to draw.  I've had birthday parties here, events here and would like to think of it as our go to spot for a night out with my buddies, or a night our with my wife.  However, this place has been going downhill.  First of all, the food is terrible.  I've several items and none of them impress me.  From burgers, to nachos, to fried chicken, to salads, to sandwiches, nothing has been anywhere close to fantastic.  Along with the bad food, they started charging cover every weekend.  I understand the live band deal and enjoy live music, but I've seen enough of the Stephanie Eason band covering everything from 80's country hits to modern rock to last me a life time and refuse to pay to see anymore.  Please, go back to the old model and just play regular old country music through that awesome sound system every once in while so I don't have to listen to save a horse ride a cowboy or eight second ride in a women's voice again.  No offense to Stephanie Eason....  I guess this place also thought it would be a good idea to start airing UFC on fight nights, which draws a completely different crowd.  I thought that's what Cactus Moon was for?  Seriously, the fight ends, the lights go out, and it's like a shift change with the crowd.  Very weird.  Last but not least, they don't always serve beer in Mason Jars anymore and the prices have gone up.  The beers are large 32 ozers but they've gone up a couple of bucks at least in just the past year or so.  All in all, this place is a blast and I hope that it can return to what it once was, a great country bar.  It draws a good crowd of friendly cowboys and cowgirls, and their wannabe versions.  It's everything Whiskey Row is not, which is a good thing and still gives them a huge advantage over that stinkhole excuse for a country bar.  I would recommend this bar to anybody who may be a fan of country music, particularly the Stephanie Eason Band.  (Joke)"}
{"text":"I really love my husband as he does try to please me often.  Sometimes he just doesn't really \"get it\"  I am a huge fan of authentic honky tonks and rowdy country bars REAL country bars out in the boonies....This place is of course a pseudo wanna be new fad country bar cashing in on the fame and name of Toby Keith.  I do like Toby Keith just fine but people he isn't bar-tending here....so when he announced he was taking me here I had to grin and bear it obviously so as not to hurt his feelings-- but i could have told you it was going to be overpriced and touristy and full of assholes that want to be weekend cowboys and cowgirls...with big titted waitresses in booty shorts taking our order....Yes there is some line dancing or swing dancing going on but unless you are really good you don't want to go out there and strut yourself because the people on the floor obviously do this on a weekly basis and are very good....so stay out of their way...  Not my thing but then again I knew it wouldn't be ---"}
{"text":"I really use to love this place. I like to go dancing and ever since they took away the bar around the dance floor, there is no place to put your drink, lean and the dance floor is virtually nonexistent when it gets crowded. The last 3 times I've been there they served me beer in a 32oz cup not a mason jar wtf? Still this place is good to come see concerts Hopefully the one opening up in Peoria will be better."}
{"text":"This place could be a great place but, food was cold and just plain, well plain it was what any other bar serves nothing special and even if they had better fare to offer, you would still have horrible service.. my husband and I went to see Shooter Jennings and check out the place... we had never been before and we decided not even 30 min after being there that never again... the waitress walked up to our table and yelled what do you want? no hello my name is or any other kind of welcome. Then she took our orders for dinner and left. Two other servers brought our dinners out and literally threw them on our table from as far away as possible and turned and ran from us without asking if the orders were right or did we need anything else and our waitress never returned to ask either. we were never asked if we wanted anything else to drink even though our drinks were empty half way through our dinner.We tried to get another serveer who was going by our table to get us drinks and silverware and she asked who our server was, we told her we did not know her name she never gave it and she went over to the order terminal to where the servers congragated to chat with each other and ignore their customers and pointed back at us and our server reluctantly took our drink orders and left. The tickets for the show said 8:00 the warm up band didn't take the stage until 8:45 and they were done at 9:15 and Shooter arrived at 10:20 and was finished at 11:30. We all but had to create a scene to get waited on and even if you did manage to get their attention they acted put upon to serve you. There was one man who was very nice but he was the only employee there that was and we figure he must have been new.."}
{"text":"Food not so good (frozen salad last time I went) unless it's fried... the fried mac and cheese is amazing.  Drinks are crazy expensive.  I think they hire dancers to get people out on the dancefloor- but it doesn't make sense to me since they are 100% better than most dancers so people just watch instead of joining in.  Weird atmosphere some nights."}
{"text":"After living in Hawaii and being a huge country fan all you hear are is how AMAZING Toby Keith's is. I ended up researching live music in Arizona and I found out that there was a David Nail concert in Mesa. So we ended up going to Toby Keith's.   Now let me tell you, this place is not easy to find. I ended up having to ask for directions from a shop worker at Shepler's. When we finally found the bar we ended up trying to go in and because we did not print out our ticket and had mobile tickets we were sent to the other door. Finally we got in and I tried to order a drink. You'd think that with so many bartenders that you wouldn't have to wait for a drink. Actually ended up waiting for 5 minutes for a bartender to notice me then I literally had to flag a bartender down. What ended up irking me is that they didn't have a menu of drinks and didn't have any drink specials that night. I ended up letting the bartender make me some sweet tea cocktail. I wasn't really happy with this bar.  The concert it's self was pretty good. The sound technicians were good and the opening act was AMAZING. Im kind of in love with Brother's Osborne now.  There was tons of merch to buy from the gift store and the band vendors. I'm not sure if I would actually eat here though.   The layout of the bar was really cool. Too bad the service sucked here. I would have definitely spent more money at this bar if I hadn't be ignored."}
{"text":"This plays good country music if u have been a long time fan. No hip hop for \"the girls\" to get out on the floor and shake our butts to though. The biggest problems i had with the place were 1. They took our table away from us to make more room 2. There were little kids still there @ 10pm 3. The place id full of Ed Hardy , Affliction wearing, fohawk rockin, pointy toe boot stylin' douche bags!! I mean full of them! It was awful!"}
{"text":"I can tell you what I'm not a fan of, country music.  What I am a fan of though is hot cowgirls!!  On that note, this is a huge venue and it can be a hell of a lot of fun!  Be prepared to be bumped all night by people.  They pack this place in.  If you can try to rent a cabana, that's your best bet not to get banged up.  This place is more of an eye candy spectacle than anything else I would say.  This is not my go to spot, but I'm more than down to come here if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Toby Keith's today and it was nothing spectacular.  The food was typical \"Famous\" named fare.  We definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Caesar salad had brown lettuce and too much store bought dressing. The French fries  had the consistency of deep fried processed potatoes. The ice-tea was weak. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 for the great looking drink menu that should be consumed prior to attempting the food."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, but the service sucks. The bartenders obviously don't want to make any money, because they ignore you if you come up to the bar. We had three or four workers walk by us last night before we just left.  I do love the live band karaoke though. They do it every Wednesday night and often will give away tickets to their upcoming concerts if you have the pipes.  They get some big name guys here for cheap, which is really exciting. I've never been to one of these shows, but I am planning on going before I move out of Arizona.  If they worked on their service, this place could be one of my favorite bars in the area."}
{"text":"Toby Keith's I don't Like This Bar.   thankfully i'm a girl and it was free to get in or i'd be angry! the poor guys who have to pay. that's so dumb.   it was basically impossible for anyone to get served here. everyone at the bar was getting irritated because no one could get drinks and when you'd place an order you'd have to wait forever again just to get the drink. same story when you're ready to close your tab. either their bartenders are horrible or they're insanely under-staffed.   regardless we left because it was horrible."}
{"text":"Great place to go to watch the UFC for free. Huge establishment. Nachos are pretty good. Order the half order if there are only 2of you. Prices on UFC night .are higher than usual. Get here early for a good seat. Overall, we enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour on a Wednesday and had a great experience. Our bartender Jason was very helpful and friendly. We got the nachos topped with beef brisket which were delicious and also the fried pickles which were good as well. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff. Went there for a birthday and asked for cake slice shots. They were made very sloppy, not looking anything like the menu. They were even missing half the ingredients to make it and didn't care to accommodate. Security at the door was rude and unwelcoming. Girl band was not that great either."}
{"text":"We walked in and were greeting with a big smile.... took a little while before we got a waitress and there weren't any smiles at all. The menu was great and BIG.   Both of our meals were great:)) and will be going back again soon. I was however also not very impressed with the managers there.  They looked pissed off and very unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"Husband and I went today for the first time, we sat on high tops and were approached by our server promptly on a Sat. Dinner hours... Our food were awesome, i had the turkey wraps which were very satisfying while my husband had the bacon burgers... I also love the fries.  We moved to the bar after dinner so we could watch the fight which started 15 minutes after our dinner, since we got there early we didn't have to pay the cover charge for the fight which was awesome! We love the ambience and would comeback again, servers are very attentive specially at the bar"}
{"text":"This place is OK, but it is really expensive, really loud and over rated.  Don't go here if you plan to talk to the people you came with."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a beer while watching a bartender ignore us to do his financials, not coming back"}
{"text":"I was prepared to not like this place because I'm pretty opposed to places that go to such great lengths to \"brand\" themselves.  First the good news:  I'm giving a 4 b/c of the dancing, the music and the bull, oh yeah and the beer in mason jars.  The food is a 2 or 3 so don't go there for the food.  But - discounting the drunk cowboy who tried to dry-hump me from behind when I bent down to get something out of my purse - I enjoyed the dancing, the live music and the booze.  We got to the restaurant before the cover charge and so after we ate our mediocre food, we were able to dance and carouse without an additional fee.  We had a great time, got all sweaty with our dancing and bull-riding, and then had our DD drive us home.  Fun, fun night!"}
{"text":"Dinner with my 6 male colleagues was slightly better than I'd expected when TK's was suggested.  They all opted for steak and seemed to enjoy them very much.  I opted for the \"She's a Hottie\" burger with french-fried onions, hatch valley chilies, and pepperjack cheese, switching the beef for a veggie burger.  I have to give them credit for this option, since my biased opinion from the back story on the cover of the menu had me thinking that something like a veggie burger would be deemed un-American.  It was just your standard Garden burger with the fixings, but they had the right amount of char on the patty to give it flavor, and combination of chiles, onion strings, and cheese was excellent.  Also the sweet potato fries on the side were the thin cut that makes them fry crisply, just the way I like.  The corn muffins with honey butter weren't that bad either.  The booth was a little crowded for the 7 of us, particularly considering the space in this place - huge bar and wide open spaces - but I was glad that we were sitting in a booth instead of having to push tables together since the concrete floors and dim lighting weren't comfortable.  The staff was friendly and very hospitable.  Bonus points for being on Dobson road, since it's a family name."}
{"text":"Good band on Friday & Saturday but no draft beer and they were out of Tito's Vodka.. Weird.  They have only had two years to order the draft beer. They must not be able to get it. That's the only obvious conclusion or did not pay an old bill at the pervious location."}
{"text":"I ordered just a regular old burger that was nothing special and quite frankly over priced. I wasn't too impressed with the live music they had playing. Also expected the atmosphere to be a little more fun and excited. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The bar is amazing but the staff is horrible. I have sent over 13 complaints to try to get a response from the owner or bar manager and have been ignored. We had our reception at this bar and it was a nightmare. Unorganized, rude staff, the waitresses could care less about anything accept for flirting with bartenders...Its so bad that the first time we visited, I had a drink and a sundae (which was amazing), but gave the girl a $100 bill and she came with change for a $20. I had to fight with her until she magically found the $100 bill!!! I should have known this was a good indication but because we used to love Toby, we tried our reception there. From start to finish it was a mess and we have wrote letters, called, emailed, hand delivered notices and NOBODY has called us back. Finally I called and tried to book a party for 100 people and got a call from Jenn in the booking department. I told her it was the only way I could get a call back...STILL IGNORED!! I could go on and on about how rude the staff is and how bad the owners have treated us after we had an unexpected, incorrect bill of $400.00 that night when we told the waitress in advance not once but 3 different times to cap us off at $250.00....Not once were we thanked for bringing so many people in that night, or paying the wrong bar tab, but totally and completely ignored. Twice the service/staff have messed up and nothing has been done. Its too bad because this place is exactly what Arizona was lacking. Too bad they dont care about return business."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to a movie Saturday night then walked over here for dinner.  We knew we would definitely not fit in here but we decided to be random and give it a shot anyway.  I don't even know who Toby Keith is, have a single plaid shirt or watch MMA fighting that was showing on the place's 100 or so TVs.  Needless to say I was a bit out of my element.  Anyway, the wait was about 20 minutes to get a table which was odd to me because the place is HUGE but for some reason it was PACKED.  Must have been the MMA fight or something.  We killed time by getting a beer at the bar and did some people watching.  The bartender was friendly and the beers are reasonably priced.  Once seated our waitress was fast, helpful and friendly.  Here is what we had:  * Krispy Fried Macaroni & Cheese - my wife actually wanted this.  I know better than to order such artery clogging food in front of her, but because it was her idea I guess it was ok.  Anyway, those things are frikkin good and I could eat 10 pounds of them probably.  The ranch dressing was a bit random but whatever...so is fried macaroni and cheese.    * Rib Tips Basket - This is why I ordered for my entress and it was just ok.  The sauce was eh and most of the \"tips\" were dry and tough.  Next time I'm just going to get a burger  This place looks like a blast if you are into that type of thing.  I'm not much into country music but I hear they have concerts n' stuff along with plenty of liquor and late night eats."}
{"text":"I have to say I had high hopes for this place but was not impressed with my overall experience.    We went on a Friday after work around 5pm. The place was empty, however,  it still took almost 15 min to get drinks. This was an issue for most of the night. The good news they had $2 drafts till 7.   We ordered appetizers to share and had Beef Nachos and the sampler platter. The nachos were very good and came with plenty of meat.  The sampler platter was ok.  I was really excited for the fried mac and cheese but it's bland and tastes like nothing.    Once it got later there was a live band and dancing which was fun.   We still had fun so I will probably give it a second chance to see if the service is better on another day."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to Toby Keith's on High Street in Phoenix. I left my credit card there because they asked if I wanted to keep my tab open after ordering a round of drinks and I told them to keep it open. They kept my credit card, no big deal. At the end of the night, I closed my tab out and left. I realized that I didn't have my card back and went back to get it. I spoke with five separate bar tenders who told me that they don't keep cards. I told them that I didn't have it and ignored me and I got the next bartenders attention and asked the same question. After about fifteen minutes, one of the bartenders brings me my card and said, \"Sorry, we did have it\".  I turned to the other bartenders who said that they didn't have it and said, \"I've got my card now, thanks\".  All of a sudden one of the security guys is pushing me, saying that I was behind the bar, which I wasn't; and then about eight of them are wrestling me to the ground and dragging me out, saying I was behind the bar, which I wasn't. They ripped a brand new shirt of mine and were acting out as if I was some escaped convict or prisoner. Then a guy who said that he was the manager, Derek Neikirk, said I was behind the bar, in a canned response. He wasn't there and just covering his butt. I've never been in a fight in my life. I'm not confrontational. His staff was looking for some action and picked on me. DO NOT GO HERE. Bad people. Bad place. Not a safe environment."}
{"text":"We came in around 8:00 for dinner on a weeknight, the place was fairly dead.  I'm pretty sure my baked potato was cooked that morning, it was hard. My salad tasted like dirt.  My boyfriend's chicken was very thin and in-turn very dry. He did however love the baked beans which appeared to have pulled pork in it."}
{"text":"I attended Toby Keith's 2009 fan club party at this location.  Toby's appearance at the event made it pretty wild and memorable.  Since this was a special private event, I assume this contributed to the good attentive service from the enthusiastic staff (I noticed that several other folks doing reviews on Yelp have commented on the customer service being poor).  I had a great spot at the bar not too far from the stage and this made the experience really enjoyable.  I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries - it was very good (and I'm pretty picky about my BBQ since I'm from Alabama).  Of course, I drank my beer from the big Mason jar that you get to keep.  I recommend this place because of the fun atmosphere and the good music they play.  It's definitely worth at least one visit before you make up your mind."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it opened! It's big, it has live music, good drinks and slightly above-par bar food. It draws in such a diverse crowd and everyone is there for a good time! It's a good people-pleasing place and I can usually get big groups of random friends, not just country fans, to go there.  However, it definitely peaked, got a little too trendy and big for its britches, if you will. Drinks got ridiculously expensive, there are covers some nights and it gets sardines-crowded. I think having competition in Cactus Moon next door come in brought them back down to reality because the last time I was at TK's, it felt more like the original Toby's I know and love."}
{"text":"Went Thursday with two lady friends for \"Ladies' Night\" which was posted as starting at 8PM on their website -  turns out it didn't start until 9 - bad advertising!  Waitress didn't know what beers they have on tap (not impressive line, anyway), and didn't know about a couple of fairly basic drinks (don't they train their people???)....    The \"DJ\" from KNIX basically turned on his laptop and started the playlist.  No interaction, nothing... they would have done better to just turn up the house music...  There weren't a lot of people there, even after 10 PM, about when I left.... I pity the guys who had to pay a cover charge....  it wasn't worth it for FREE!!!!   This was the second time I've been to this bar - likely won't be back!!  Should be named \"You Probably Won't Like This Bar\"....."}
{"text":"Meh, thats really the first word that jumps into my mind when I think about my experiences at Toby Keiths. I went to the one in Vegas at the Harrahs Casino and it was ok, nothing special though. Very loud and crazy bar, at least that location is. Mesa location is a bit tamer but still kinda crazy. Food was typical bar food (burgers, fried food, etc) on both occasions (Vegas and this location), drinks were ok, service was fine both times. I can't really complain but this is not one of those places I would not choose to go to. Typical sports bar in my opinion. A couple of positives I can say is that they do make a hella good fried twinkie dessert and the waiters at the Mesa location are hilarious and a blast. Bottom line, this is one of those places you go to party, be loud and obnoxious. If you are looking for a quiet place with tasty terrific food, you will most likely not find it here."}
{"text":"This place is huge. That is the good. The drinks are reasonably priced during happy hour which is another good thing (if you can ever get someone to notice you). The bartenders hmm I am not sure If I did something wrong or didn't have the right look, but I was ignored for 5 mins ( yep I am one of those that times to see how long it takes to be acknowledged) and it wasn't even a bartender (which they had a good amount of on a Friday night) that took care of me but one of their friendly waitresses who happened to notice me still standing at the bar. Sigh...  The manager on duty seem to be having a bad night as she appeared to have a scowl on her face every time someone asked her a question or as she walked around. I am going to chalk this up as to them having a bad night. The lovely waitress that took care of me and my crew ( I was the token in the group lol) was amazing and for that she alone gets 5 stars (thank you Brandi) everyone else.. eh.."}
{"text":"Love country bars so I'm a little biased but this place is a great country night club (never thought of it as anything else)! Great Live music, hot girls everywhere, bartenders sexy but attentive.....FUN! Only complaints tiny dance floor, and a little pricey."}
{"text":"We have been to this location numerous times and always have a great time! The food has always been on point- get the sweet potato tots! Last night there was live music and the band was amazing. We met one of the members outside and he offered to do a shout out and song for our friends birthday, it was really nice of them. The service is usually fast and everyone is always friendly. The only complaint is our table was dirty when we got there but as soon as we mentioned it our server wiped it right away. If you want a table close to the stage, get there early! By 9 they were all taken. 5 stars all day long from this girl :)"}
{"text":"I love me some country music, so the atmosphere was great. The music is loud enough to dance, but still not too loud where I couldn't hear my girlfriends. Live music on the weekends is a great extra.   We only went there to drink, so I can't vouch for the food. The drinks were good, but SUPER overpriced. Disappointing.   However, if you're on the hunt for a cowboy/cowgirl, come here on a Fri/Sat night. It was fun to watch all the two-steppin. I'll most likely wait to come back until they have a good country artist stoppin' by."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Was given a menu saying here are our lunch specials. We then try to order from the menu and they say that menu side we ordered from is only for the weekday but it wasn't even mentioned in person or on the menu itself. So we order the 'specials' anyway for regular price because it took long enough to have the waitress take our order in the first place. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich only to be told a few minutes later that they couldn't make those on the weekends? So I ordered the chicken fried chicken dinner. Yuck. The chicken was too well done, the corn was soggy and the potatoes had a weird taste probably due to the gravy. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So although we ended up spending a FORTUNE in this place (didn't go during one of the \"specials\" nights), I still have to admit I liked the joint.    It's HUGE, very open and bright (not something you usually see for a bar), and I found the servers/bartenders all to be very nice.  Drinks weren't very strong (until I ordered a double), and they literally charge an arm and a leg for drinks and food.  Hubby was drinking the large beers - $7 a pop!!! WHOA.    The vodka drinks were actually cheaper than the large beers.  Ordered the boneless chicken wings - VERY good - but $11.  Yikes.  For an appetizer?  Overall I like the place, but I think we'll check out their calendar before going again to see when they have their specials.  p.s. they have cool VIP rooms (\"barns\") that we might look into for future parties.  FYI, in case you're looking for a party place for your country-loving friend."}
{"text":"I came here to check out Jake Owen with a bunch of friends last night. When I walked in I thought the layout was pretty cool. There is a huge bar in the center and on one side there is seating to grab some grub and the other side has the stage. As it got later and later, it got more crowded and crowded and there wasn't anywhere to go except further back into the restaurant area, bummer, but at least I could see the stage, right? Wrong! When the headliner got on stage, the staff, whom I pretty sure didn't pay to see him perform, jumped on the bar and was standing there for the first song. What the heck? Oh, right, they need to take pictures. Oh, wait, only two out of the six actually had cameras...weird. Eventually the other four got down and we were just left with two to maneuver around to see the stage. There are several TV's set up that are showing the stage and what's going on, but due to the light show, you weren't able to see the band.   I thought drink prices were pricey and dear reader, don't even bother ordering a $6 small shock top because its gone in about four sips. The ladies bathroom had an attendant taking up a lot of room and thus making the line to just wash your hands slow, but they bathroom was clean despite the number of drunk people using it. \"Meh. I've experienced better\" pretty much sums up my time at Toby Keith's."}
{"text":"Good bar to go with 20-somethings and hang out. I, however, am not a 20-something so this didn't really appeal to me.  There is a \"dining\" side to this place but the whole thing is big and open so if they are doing a sound check (like they were while we were there at 4pm) then it's louder than normal and hard to have a conversation.  The menu has lots of options but the food quality is pretty standard IMO. I had a southwest grilled chicken salad and while it sounded great on the menu... it didn't excite me when I saw it nor when I ate it.  Pretty standard fare.  It's not bad... but it's not great.  And since there are lots of options in that area... I'd probably opt to go elsewhere. I also had the pomegranate margarita.  It was good but a bit too sweet for my taste.  Live and Learn.  My friends ordered a special that came with potato skins as an appetizer, and they really didn't look appetizing.  They look as they had been premade hours before and then re-warmed because the skins were dried out and the cheese was hard.  The burger on the other hand looked great.  It was juicy and big.  My buddy devoured it.  So... maybe that's the ticket.  :)  The service was pretty Ok.  Of course, she forgot a water and a beer and remembered only after being reminded a couple of times.  But she was nice enough."}
{"text":"This seems like a good addition to the Mesa Riverview.  Scantily clad women in cowboy boots, hey I can appreciate that.  Just had appetizers and salad, which were both fresh and tasted good.  Nobody trying to reinvent the wheel or anything but I think thats what you expect.  I've been told its a great place for some good ol' country dancin on the weekends, but I haven't made it over for that just yet.  Reviewing my old Billie Ray Cyrus music videos first."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!! Im a manager of a local business so I know when a place is not managed well. My father was in town to go to some spring training MLB games and I wanted to show him a good time. We decided to go check out the new Chicago Cubs spring training stadium and after the game I wanted to go have a few beers and some appetizers. Being that it was after a sold out game the bar was packed. Nobody was really sitting at tables just the bar which is huge. And at this huge bar which was packed with people there was ONE bartender, yeah ONE!! Later another girl came to help but looked like she was maybe a waitress just helping out. Then when you looked around there were 5 or 6 girls just standing around doing nothing. So the two that were behind the bar were working hard as they could but needless to say, it took forever to get a beer and order any food. Then when we tried to order some tacos because it was Tuesday and they do a Taco Tuesday with tacos for a dollar, we were told that they didn't do tacos on game days. That they cooks can't keep up with the demand if they do. What?!!? Are you kidding me? They should know like all the other local business in the Phoenix area that you double up on staff during spring training in order to keep up with the extra amount of business. Instead they were under-staffed where they needed it the most and did not honor what was advertised in their menus because the kitchen is under-staffed. We stayed anyways and ordered fried pickles which took forever and then my dad finished his beer and wanted another one to wash down the pickles but the bartender and the waitress who was helping out were over-whelmed by the large crowd. Also they serve their beers in red solo cups which is cool for the rednecks because they can feel like their back on the farm drinking out of a keg. However it makes it impossible for the bartenders to know when you need a new beer. They have to come over and look down into your cup. That's hard to do when you have 50 plus people to serve. We finally gave up and went next door to the Cactus Moon where they were just as busy if not busier and have a bar almost the same size. Except at Cactus Moon they had 4 bartenders and they were constantly checking up on us and were super friendly. I advise going there because they obviously have better management than Toby Keiths which would probably not sit well with Toby Keith. So Mr. Keith if you read Yelp, your bar in Mesa, AZ needs HELP!!!"}
{"text":"Had gift certificates so figured, why not? Got the sampler, some beers, and some mashed potatoes. Nothing in the sampler was particularly good...and the mashed potatoes tasted like nothing other than undercooked potatoes."}
{"text":"Ok, the only reason I was at Toby Keith's was for a coworkers bday. Never again. It was some sort of torture that I would just as soon forget.  The only thing I had to eat was a steak Quesadilla which arrived 20 minutes late because they brought me the wrong food originally. The place only played Toby Keith music until the band started. Fine, I didn't know who he was but anything playing for two hours in a row would get on your last nerve. The worst part of the whole night was the men. I was kicked in the calves by a guy trying to get my attention. Really? Do you really want to talk to me &*^hole? Yeah try kicking me again. Another dubious guy asked me to dance and I told him that my feet hurt (6 inch heels in a crappy bar does have that effect).  He proceeds to say, \"That's what you get for being so *&^%ing sexy\"  Wow. So by all means, if these lines and gimmicks are your cup of tea, you might like this place. I on the other hand will stick to my wine bars."}
{"text":"The service is slow, but the food is good and the drinks are strong. Plus they honored a yelp coupon!!"}
{"text":"We had friends in from out of state and they chose this bar solely based on the fact that they are fans of Toby Keith. This isn't how I pick places to go out for dinner but hey, they were our guests!   We arrived at 7:00 and we were seated in about 15 minutes. While waiting for a table some friends got a mason jar of Miller Light at the bar-- which we all thought was cool, except that each mason jar of beer was $10.  When the hostess seated us, she warned that we would possibly be limited to 1 hour and 15 minutes at our booth. Everyone in our party was annoyed about this at first but we were never actually asked to move to the bar so in the end this worked out okay.  I tried a couple boneless wing in the Jack Daniel's whiskey BBQ sauce-- they were pretty good! I also tried a mozzarella stick and that was only so-so. Not as crispy as I would have liked it to be.  I got the 4x4 Big Bacon with Cheese but substituted a beef patty for a turkey burger patty and I asked for half the amount of cheese. The burger was really good, the bacon was delicious and the bun was very fresh. The fries weren't very hot when they came out and my pickle spear was warm and soggy.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but it was okay."}
{"text":"Used a Group On for first visit.  Visit was during 'off hours' on a weekday afternoon.  Atmosphere was great with plenty of room. Food was good and beer was cold and great.  Happy hour is 11a.m. to 7p.m.  and draft domestics were full size and only $2, plus other great drink deals.  I had St. Louis ribs that were very good and excellent sides of fried Okra and waffle fries.  Wife had excellent hamburger with fixins.  Only problem was VERY slow service, maybe due to time of day.  We'll definitely be going back for more food, drink, and fun."}
{"text":"Service takes forever!!!   Either you need to be dishing out awesome tips to get attention or need to be a hot piece to get a bartender's attention. Just sayin'   Live bands and dancing is amazing!"}
{"text":"My friends and I go here on weekends sometimes and I really enjoy this place.  Let me start off by saying I haven't eaten here so I'm not judging on food or anything like that.  I've always gone so late in the night that I show up for the live music and dancing with cute cowboys and cowboy wannabes.  I've had a few drinks there and I've never seen the bill outrageous or anything and they've never been gross when I've had them.  I don't know if they have nights that aren't live music as it's my friend who always picks the nights we go there and I've only been there with live music of bands she enjoys and we've always had a blast.  I've been told there is mechanical bull riding which I haven't been there any of those nights either.  But I'm not really a country music kind of girl and even so I've enjoyed the bands that played there.  I've personally never had an issue finding parking either and I've never been mistreated by staff.  I over all have a good time when I'm here."}
{"text":"This place is just okay but nothing more.  I went there with 5 friends and the only bright side about the place was the A/C.  The front is crowded and busy with people eating, the back is empty and almost dead.  The bar is huge and takes up most of the space. There were about a million girls walking around in skimpy tops and skimpy shorts and I'm not sure what their jobs were because all I saw them do is walk around and talk to each other.  We eventually got served by a man that came clear from the other side of the bar to help us out since all the women were ignoring us...guess they get better tips from the penis crowd and prefer serving only them.  The 6 of us all ordered different drinks and the guy was quick on making them but we all questioned if he even put alcohol in them.  We all felt like we just drank soda or water. I've personally felt more of a buzz off of Kombucha tea than I did their vodka drinks. I thought it was just me but my super lightweight friend said she was surprised that she didn't feel or taste any alcohol (which she personally liked).  The drinks were cheap as if we just got a soda which is a good thing I guess.  The dance floor was dead, no one wanted to get on it and the band was not bad. I did see they had a special for ladies night to extremely cheap beer but my friends and I saw one of the bartender girls pouring beers and she was filling up glass after glass of foam. She set about 5 or more glasses aside for a few mins and returned to dump the foam before filling them back up with more foam. She set them back to the side, went and help others and returned after the foam settled to fill them up with guess what...EVEN MORE FOAM! Usually when I see foam it's a clear sign the temp isn't right and/or you're not pouring the beer right from the tap which can create more foam.  I watched her pathetically try for about 30 mins before one of the male bartenders walked over, dumped her glasses and basically told her to go away.  This just tells me they need to train everyone better.  I've been to other Toby Keith locations before out in Mesa that were tons of fun. This place has a lot of work to do.  I will give them a second chance and see if anything changes though."}
{"text":"Overpriced Mediocre food. I can actually deal with the food but the line dancing instructor who believes she needs to scream into the microphone along with the excruciatingly loud music makes my meal impossible to enjoy. This will go down as the fastest meal I've eaten in my life. I even asked to tune down the volume to no avail. Clearly they aren't interested in attracting customers ( unless they are already deaf )."}
{"text":"So I was taking my grandmother out for dinner and let her pick where she wanted to go and to my surprise, she picked Toby Keith's. We had a GREAT time!!!!  The I should have been a cowboy burger was awesome. The onion rings on it were nice and fat, and there was just the right amount of BBQ sauce on it. The fries were nice and crispy and not all soggy.  My grandmother had the pulled pork loader, which was a baked potato loaded with cheese, and pulled pork. All I know about it was that my grandma said that she couldn't have been happier with it. I would have liked a bite, but it was gone before I could even ask.  Our server, Rose, did a FANTASTIC job last night!!! She was on top of everything and very friendly. She deserves a lot of the credit for us having such a good experience.  I have been here several times and never had a bad time. I have seen shows there like Shooter Jennings and it is a great place to check out shows too. There is just enough room to dance and have a good time during the shows.   Over all, \"I Love This Bar\"!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the KFYI smackdown so I guess it was a little busy...but it didn't seem that busy! I ordered the wings and when they didn't get to me after 15 minutes I knew what to expect. They were cold. I hate that! Don't servers know it takes like 5 minutes to make wings? They probably sat somewhere for ten minutes. But since i was starving i ate them, plus I couldn't get the bartender's attention. I had 2 beers and then asked for water...which never came. The sever never smiled once and seemed annoyed to be bothered. I don't think I would ever go back. On the plus side the waitresses are easy on the eyes:}"}
{"text":"Updated 8/4/15 - well folks, this location is the latest Toby Keiths to open here in AZ and is the last one standing and based on all of the reviews since it's opening earlier this year, there will be a nice large space opening up soon for a future business at City North.  Appears this place STILL has not gotten their act together.  Rude \"security\" aka door people with attitude who can't get a job elsewhere (maybe due to their bad attitudes and lack of knowing what customer service is), bartenders with an attitude and lack of knowledge in drink prep 101, food prep that is below par, service... well there truly is none.  This establishment, the people managing and working there don't give a crap about customer service and once it closes down, they can all disperse and take their lack of caring to another unsuspecting establishment.  Just hope not anywhere I frequent!"}
{"text":"Best part is you don't have to drive all the way to Peoria to get bad food, bad service.  Sure wish Whiskey River was still around.  Took soooooo long to open and this is the result?"}
{"text":"A gift shop in the bar? I am not the too cool for school type but really? Cheesy atmosphere, chain, bad service and gift shop.  Sorry in this case 4 strikes you are out."}
{"text":"How disappointing. Only two bartenders on such a big bar. Food order was taken after sitting there for 20 min and then some of it was wrong. Bad idea after the ball game."}
{"text":"Love this place.  So few dance clubs are still around that I don't feel like I'll be shot at.  Now that Devil's Martini is closed, there aren't too many places to get your dance on.  It helps if you are a fan of country music.  They serve beer in mason jars and I think men still hold doors open for women here.  If you are a lady, you're in for a treat.  Most of the guys can really dance.  I mean, actually lead you by the hand and dance and twirl and actually make you feel graceful.  All of the sudden all of those country love songs start to make sense :)  That being said, I never feel creepy or put upon (not something I can say with regards to most dance clubs).  Late, late in the evening, the music may get interspersed with some top 40.  But overall, I come here for the fun and dancing, I haven't had the food because its the rare place where I actually don't even think about food when I enter the door!"}
{"text":"We went for beers and a snack when it wasn't busy at all. I think it was maybe 4 on a Saturday. Very nice layout and looked like it would be a fun place in the evening. Food was good but the service was horrible!!!! We will never be back. Had at least 10 waitresses  just hanging out talking while we were waiting to be served on. We would have stayed longer and had a few more beers if it didn't take 20 minutes to get one. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I really had my doubts about this place, and my dinner group went there sort of as a joke. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was sort of an A-List Hooters type in a D cup. All pleasant as can be for being visually raped hundreds of times a night by Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel and friends.  THE FOOD: Deep fried mac 'n cheese appetizers. Damn those things are addictive! I could have eaten an entire basket by myself. The ranch dipping sauce adds just the right amount of coolness to the triangle of ooey-gooey goodness. I had T.K.'s \"Diablo\" Chile Chicken Sandwich: Grilled chicken breast, fire roasted Ortega green Chiles, Swiss cheese, bacon and jalapeno mayo. Being from New Mexico, I'm skeptical about how anyone else does green chile, but this was just right. Tender chicken breast with two BIG green chiles sliced and laid on the burger providing a perfect amount of heat to the chicken. Not sure I even detected the jalapeno mayo, and I got some regular mayo on the side for the fries and ended up adding it to the sandwich as well. Others at the table had steaks and said they were acceptable, but not great. The freedom fries were standard fries, but tasty.  THE EXPERIENCE: Too many entrances. We were meeting as a group and everyone came in a different door. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but this place is HUGE. We were there on a Friday night and halfway through the meal couldn't even hear each other because the live band had started.  I would defnitely go again, but not on a night when they had live music."}
{"text":"Very loud cant talk to the person you came with,terrible food.o will never go again and well tell my family."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on the 4th of July. Should have read the reviews before I went there. It took 20 mins for a server to come to our table on a sat night!(it wasn't that busy)when we did finally order drinks our server said there were no specials,even though on the Facebook page it said american girl drinks were $5. Of course when the bill came we were charged $8 for them. I showed the waitress and said she would let the manager know. She took one off, so that was good. The thing that saved them was Laura Walsh. She was the singer that night and she killed it!"}
{"text":"I came here wanting to like it. Food and drinks slow to arrive food cold plate hot. Fail"}
{"text":"Being a country fan I wanted to check out Tobie's. First time we visited it had just opened in the afternoon and we had the place to ourselves. We had a nice friendly waitress, food was very good, and we had a great time walking around looking at all the interesting country stuff. Went back a couple on nights later and had dinner at the bar, boy what a difference, the help was so busy talking with one another it was next to impossible to get waited on, might be the worst service I have ever experienced, the food was still pretty good, nice place to see a sporting event, lots of big screens, but come on Toby, we really want to love this bar, just fire those non-servers behind the bar!!"}
{"text":"I went there with the guys last night for the nachos, which were delicious as always. I really don't think you can find many better, any especially not for ten dollars.  That being said, the service was some of the worst I have ever had eating out. The guy was nice enough, but he was just really bad at his job. Everything took so long, from almost thirty minutes to get our nachos (which was probably not his fault), to refilling our drinks (which did not happen once all night unless we waved him down and asked). I don't ever expect a server to ask if I want another drink when he is still serving my food, or when I ask for another one. The answer is yes, and if you would bring it, that would be great. I have no idea how long it would have taken to get our checks if we wouldn't have asked for them, and then brought them back to him with our payments.  4 stars for the food, a generous 2 for service"}
{"text":"I really wanted this bar to be fun.  I really wanted it to prove all the other reviews wrong.  Unfortunately, it's just as bad as others have said it is.  My friend's after-wedding-party was held here.  The friend I had traveled with and I made our way over and were shocked by the line to get in.  We figured the line was simply to check ID, however, it was also to check our purses and get wristbands.  Also, it's a $5 cover charge for men!  1) why is there a cover charge for a place this size? 2) why did security say they check bags for bottles of Jameson?  We got our wristbands and headed inside.  This place is massive.  In the center is the bar which is shaped like a guitar.  To the right is more of a dining area.  To the left is a huge stage with live performers, a dance area, and a couple of private areas for parties.  We found our friend's party in one of the private areas and headed in.  It was nice since it gave full view of the stage but country isn't really my thing so I just bopped my head along to the beat and watched in amazement as couples took over the dancefloor.  We were told to go to the bar to get our drinks and tell them which tab it was under.  My friend and I found an open spot at the bar and were told they don't \"take drink orders there and to move to the middle\".  Um....Okay.  So we did that, the bartender got my beer wrong, then said, \"we don't keep tabs at the bar\" but he was \"nice enough\" to tell our server.  Fine.  Later on, we saw our server coming to the party area to take drink orders.  Overall, this place could be a million times better if they lightened up on security just a bit, got rid of the cover charge for men, and got better bartenders.  The servers were all very nice and like I said, the space is massive.  It has potential."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour.  Great place to relax, have a beer and enjoy some good music."}
{"text":"I went to this so called country bar on a Sunday night when they had $1 drafts and $1 SoCo and lime.  The beer came in one of those cups you get at a dentist's office to swish and spit.  I did not bother with the mixed drink.  We sat for over 5 minutes before the bartender came over, and it was NOT busy, no elbow to elbow here.  Plus, he was deaf.  I didn't want any alcohol and asked for a soda and my husband got the dixie cup beer.  I waited 10 minutes and went to the bathroom, and FINALLY when I got back I had a soda.  Sorry I didn't want any booze!  The atmosphere was lame, mostly college aged yuppie types, no country here, except for music.  And according to the website, the bartenders and booze girls were supposed to be the hottest in the valley.  Yeah NO!  If you like caked on makeup, fake boobs and skanky outfits.  You'd think they would hire more of the girl next door type, more country.  The bathroom was horrible.  I went to 4 stalls before I found one suitable to use.  YUCK!  Lastly, they pull that sketchy crap where they charge you $20 before your debit goes through.  We spent $1.50 total and my bank account shows a $20 hold.  That reminds me of the stuff they pull in swanky Scottsdale bars and clubs.  If you want to go to a real country bar where the people are great, the atmosphere is laid back, the prices are awesome for mixed drinks, you get your bikers, lookers, thirsty hitch-hikers, and it really is in the \"country\", go to the Roadrunner Restaurant and Saloon in New River Arizona.  Plus the bartenders are some of the best looking, most awesome people around.  Screw Toby and his failed attempt at capitalizing on a song."}
{"text":"I agree with others about the growing pains. The food was spot on and tasted really good. I was curious and wanted to try it so I ignored the reviews.  I would come back again especially when I saw that kids eat free all day everyday. I am sure as they get busier they will iron out the kinks which had NOTHING to do with the food.  Come try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I've been there at Toby's twice and never had so much fun. The dinner was great an the staff was fun. I hope they don't close."}
{"text":"Thought I would check this place out shortly after they opened, give some time to work the kinks out. Well.....it's a fail. I'm in the business and the bartender tried to STEAL!! ALL READY!!!!!He said your beers are $21and I asked for a receipt. He gave us a receipt for 24.73...but the time stamp was 2 hours earlier!! But he didn't say anything like \"sorry I missed quoted, it was $24.75.\" So I'm guessing he ate the $3 bucks but I guess he's already up a few hundred. The food was decent but  the ALL dude bar staff....that is shady....think I'll pass FOREVER!!!! If you wanna get ripped off for bad service and food,, this is your place. FYI if your a manager or owner...most of your tenders are STEALING from you! If you don't care...I guess we won't see you after summer. Good luck."}
{"text":"Don't bother walkin', cuz this bar's a rockin'!  Yep, I went to TK's on Saturday night and it was shakin' with excitement!  This might already be the Valley's premier location for Hot Country music and dancing!    The restaurant and bar were already packed by the time I got there at 8:00 to meet some friends.  We ordered some food, and I must say, food, is not why you go to TK's.  So if you're thinking you're going to have some grand culinary experience, don't waste your time.  It's just typical bar food here.  Hamburgers, steaks, wilted french fries, fried stuff everywhere.  They serve meals meant for beer lovers.  The more you drink, the better the food tastes.  However, I loved the band.  The music was great.  Everyone was having a good time dancing.  And if you're a carnivore, this place is great!  There was beefcake everywhere!  I give it 3 stars, because frankly I'd rather eat my calories than drink them.  But the bonus is, as long as you go after 9:00 PM when the band is playing, you get a great workout along with a show!  PS.  Make sure you wear your cowboy attire!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is not just any typical bar and grill. Live Music, dance floor, good food, friendly customer service, clean restaurant.... This is the place to go. Owned by future Country Music Hall of Fame himself Toby Keith, he allows other genres of music to perform here besides country. The bar is really big and there shouldn't be any bad reviews about it's space..... THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF ROOM!!  Every meal I have ordered here so far came out of the kitchen with an appetizing presentation and well cooked. Can't complain at all about this place.  This place is highly Military Friendly.  You will see me as a regular here at Toby Keiths I Love This Bar & Grill"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable experience there.  We went for the Wednesday Karaoke night and was surprised to find out it is with a Live Band.  Very unique experience, but most of the performers were top notch and the band kicked ass so it was almost like getting a free concert.   Had the Turkey wrap and it was very tasty.  We will go back again."}
{"text":"Toby Keith once made a song and accompanying video for \"I Love this Bar\". The songs chorus was a blatant rip off of the Crash Tests Dummies (mmm, mmm, mmm?!?) and I'm really surprised that all of Canada didn't protest and simultaneously sue him in turn for this blasphemy. The video was also a blatant rip off of my second favorite scene from \"The Blues Brothers\" movie (sorry but even Jake and Elwood can't hold a candle to Cab Calloway singing Mini the Moocher) where the boys end up playing (Rawhide anyone?) in a rural, run down country bar. Beyond knowing that he sings songs vaguely country music like in nature and that he was a very outspoken \"Support our troops and America Fuck Yeah!\" kind of guy that pandered to Middle Americans I don't know much about one Toby Keith. Don't get me wrong I do have a soft spot for a smattering of country crooners, but Toby doesn't really seem to be in the same league (or hemisphere really) as the likes of George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and the original Hank Williams.  The hap and circumstance as to why I and the better half ended up in \"Toby Keith's I Love this Bar and Grill\" are unimportant but we have forgiven...though I have not forgotten. If Toby Keith had any consulting help when he green lit and went forward with this idea the company that did so should be dissolved and the yes men that told him that the name was a fantastic idea should be drawn and quartered. The name is entirely too long and the place is such an abomination that the man should be embarrassed to have his name attached to it. The name is so long that I will not be referring to it as Toby Keith's I Love this Bar and Grill and because I'm so embarrassed for him having his named attached to it I don't want to call it just \"Toby Keith's\". I haven't thought of a suitable nickname yet but \"Turd Bucket\" has a nice ring to it.  The \"bar\" is nothing more than a tourist trap where everything is overpriced and comes complete with a full size store where you can buy all the Toby Keith's I Love this Bar and Grill merch your credit card can carry. The menu is uninspired, the contents of which you can find better quality at any BBQ or steak joint anywhere in the city. I've actually seen better looking steaks come off of an electric stove top. The actual physical bar is gigantic (I'm guessing like Texas, everything is bigger in Toby Keith's world) which leaves plenty of space for the bar staff to completely ignore you. And oh the staff...a collection assembled for their perceived physical attributes and not actual skill left us with a feeling that a fraternity and sorority were all given community service for the night. Back in the days when I had cable I saw an advertisement for a \"plastic surgery nightmares\" show of some kind; I'm guessing they filmed most of it here. The female staff should have skipped the awful boob jobs and botched collagen lip jobs and opted to join a gym to get rid of their muffin tops and flabby appendages. The guys should probably just chop their balls off now before all the steroids shrivel them up. While I normally appreciate places that have a decent beer selection and carry PBR tall boys, I can't stand places that over charge for tall boys of PBR; which of course this place does.  The only salvageable quality of the place is that it was located super close to a freeway making our escape that much easier.  Correction...there were actually a mentionable moment on the dance floor located in front of the stage which were both ridiculously proportioned as well. Here we watched a cowboy dressed in matching black leather pants, vest and cowboy hat (shirtless except for the vest of course) twirl his female counterpart at dizzying speeds to a tune only they could here. His attire actually only reminded me of a little place called \"Charlie's\" and how the black leather dancer would have been a hit any given night there. In fact Charlie's is actually a superior country theme bar in every conceivable facet; even offer line dancing and two step lessons for all us budding cow pokes. It also happens to be one of the best gay dance clubs I've ever been to in my entire life. Something tells me we won't be hearing a new hit single by Toby Keith about Charlie's anytime soon.  But if he does pen a country song about Charlie's I'd like to suggest that he just rips off one of his own songs...perhaps the chorus could be...\"Mmm, mmm, mmm I love that...\" Alas dear reader, the rooster is crowing and the pullet is trying to get out of its cage. You'll forgive this capon if he doesn't finish that last thought."}
{"text":"Deep Fried Twinkies. Yessiree Bob, there is such a thing and the Okie Toby Keith's serves them up. Heart attack optional. Artery blockage very likely!! Served up with a bunch of whipped cream and gooey strawberries.   Had lunch here with a friend and happy hour once. Nachos were not good. Drinks were average. But hello Fried Twinkie. You're right up there with Mud Pie and Tiramasu as the dessert of choice!!   Skip the alcohol and save your liver :)"}
{"text":"I have heard good things about their concerts and the nightlife dance scene. I skipped that and took my German husband there for lunch.  Gals at front dressed in uber skimpy outfits which may be a male attraction.  All of them seemed rather clueless.  We sat at the bar and after having the bar tender walk past us 5 or 6 times with no greeting of any kind we were informed the \"Kitchen was totally backed up because someone called in sick\" thus no orders were being accepted.  I found this rather strange because there were only 10 people eating.  Surely one cook could handle the \"rush.\"  Anyway, we didn't eat and just ordered beer.  Had four grossly overpriced, beers.  Almost impossible to get the bar tenders attention.  Getting check was a chore, getting our credit card run was a chore.  The place wasn't busy at all.  Seemed everyone who worked in this very large joint was touting a 2 digit IQ.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I despise country music. That being said, it is really a good thing that Toby Keith's also allows other bands from other genres to play there. The stage is nice and located right in front of a nice dance floor which people were taking advantage of while I was there.   As I have stated in previous reviews of mine, I am pretty huge on ambiance, and I really love everything about Toby Keith's. The bar is huge and centrally located between the tables and the stage. The selection of alcohol is large and the bartenders are super friendly.   The bathrooms are really really really clean... in case you were wondering.   I love the little Jack Daniel's set up they have.   I have not had the food, but it looks delicious.   Overall, I like this bar. I probably won't go back though unless it is on a night that a country band is not playing."}
{"text":"Seriously...just got back from a birthday dinner at Toby's. I'm going to need some time, gather my thoughts, before I can accurately describe how bad the service was. Hard to comprehend...stay tuned amigos and amigas ;)  Ok...I'm back ;) we sat down, party of six, ready to spend. Celebrating two birthdays. Ordered a round of drinks...then...the restaurant manager decided to hold a 15 minute staff meeting with all the servers. (Insert Cricket sound) Did my drink order get relayed to the bar? Oh no it did not!  That was just the start. Getting a second round of drinks was like an act of congress.   Dinner came and everyone got served except for one person who ordered the ribs. Her plate didn't show up for 15 minutes. The rest of us were done eating by then. We called the manager over to ask where her food was...she said she'd comp the ribs and buy a round for everyone. Now you ask...were the ribs and the comped round taken off the tab? No they were not ;)that was another 15 minutes.  ha ha. One has to laugh.   And the kicker ...after all the delays...they reminded us near the end of dinner that my daughter (who's 15) needed to leave before 8pm!  Honestly, too bad the service is so sad because the live music was good and some of the food was decent.  I guess it's fair to call Toby's a bar with a very laid back approach to customer satisfaction. Like you're the one lucky to be there ;)  Take care all... Seasons greetings :)"}
{"text":"Get it together already...  Love country but music only around bar area....  Food nothing to brag about...  Service still not up to par...."}
{"text":"Great music. Fun atmosphere. Spotty service, though. The only bartender who was attentive was Jesus. Recommend going to him."}
{"text":"Big. Drafty. Good location . Service excellent. 2.00 beer and call liquor but crown and water was $8.00 . Bill had the Delmonico sirloin, 19.00, as did my mom, tasty and tender. I had the southwest chicken salad for 10.50. Salad was huge, plenty of chicken, dressing on side. We asked for a lot of extras and our waitress was cheerful and happy to deal with us.  Reasonable, clean, but cold. I can see how this could be a fun bar for the 20-30 crowd tho"}
{"text":"Rating is actual zero stars!  My wife and I met our daughter and her friends for some drinks and food on Saturday night (4/18).  Place was a little over half full, which was surprising being that it was 9:30 and there was live music (and I believe opening weekend).  Service was poor. Most beers on tap and bottles were out (or not available). It took over 30 minutes for the server to actually come help us.  She took our order and then we didn't see her for another 20-30 minutes.  This is what we experienced the entire time there (almost three hours).  Food didn't look appetizing and was overpriced.  We had high hopes for this place being that it took many months to open. If Toby Keith actually experienced what we experienced, he'd shut it down in a heartbeat and tell management to start over or find another job.  None of us plan to go back.  They not only lost eight returning customers, but with all our family and friends combined, they will be losing out on 50-100 new customers.  Too bad!"}
{"text":"I generally get a beer from Toby Keith's but I decided to get a mixed drink for a change. Well when I got what looked like a dixie cup w/ my beverage in it and the bill for $12 I was for lack of better words pissed off.  I know now to stick to beer if I go here. I really do dig the ambiance of the place, and the novelty of getting a beer in a mason jar but seriously the prices for drinks are a bit ridiculous. For kicks I asked how much the drink would have been if I had gotten it in a mason jar and she told me $17. Wow... I'll stick to my fave local bars, I suppose and come out for an occasional band/act here and there in the future. Sorry Toby Keith's, just a tad disappointed"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening for a friends birthday.  Horrible customer service with the exception of one very petite hostess who greeted us as we walked by her podium.  I absolutely hate the idea of handing over my credit card for the waitress to hold on to until we are ready to leave.  (Even though we would be paying cash)  I thought the strippers showed up but it turns out they were the bouncers.  Apparently bouncers don't know how to talk to people, just get in somebody's face and yell and push.  Situations could be handled more efficiently, say take aside the person who booked the party and tell them what the problem is and take care of it from there.  Don't go off and throw out everybody who stands up and wants to know what the heck is happening.  We had to wait at least twenty  minutes for waitress to bring our bill when we were ready to go, and then find out the tip was already added in.  Two beers and an appetizer $39.  Do we need change?"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and snacks with a bunch of friends.  Service was terrible!  Took forever to get drinks and food!  Food was not good, mostly fried foods on appetizer menu. Looks nice inside. Would not recommend!!  Will not go back!  Wine selection was very limited!"}
{"text":"OK Toby, I think you are a proud American and a patriot who would do anything and everything for your country! Your restaurant is OK. The atmosphere is good and the wait staff is pretty nice to look at. Here's the deal, the service is always slow and the prices are pretty high. Ive had the steak, burgers and wings. I come back for the wings. The price is a little high but they are big and the sauces are good."}
{"text":"a fun place for drinks and food was good but the worst service I've had in the valley!! will not come back for for that reason alone."}
{"text":"I have been to Toby Keith's a couple of times over the years. The first time was a couple of years ago for a local concert that became ridiculously overcrowded and claustrophobic but I will disregard that initial experience and review only this experience today. I met my mom here for a late lunch around 3pm because we were in the area so it was convenient. Our waitress was really nice and attentive and we wanted to take our time and she didn't have a problem with that.  I ordered a green chili chicken sandwich (with no bun) and a side of coleslaw. My mom had a turkey club sandwich. My chicken was pretty good. It was a little overcooked but it wasn't bad. Nothing to write home about. My mom's turkey club was a HUGE serving and she said it was just okay.  Overall for a midday dining experience we had an okay experience. The food was okay, the service was good. Would I be back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"Toby's Keith's is so much fun. They host the best concerts and you can dance the night away! Bartenders are awesome and friendly! Great food as well!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to have dinner here. I didn't realize that it got such poor reviews on Yelp. I really enjoyed my dinner, though, so I'm glad that I didn't check Yelp beforehand because I wouldn't have tried it otherwise. The restaurant itself is really normal. The food they offer is nothing different from any other American restaurant. It's all food that you can get at a fast food, but it's just at a restaurant.  I got the \"The Dip\" Cowboy Steak Sandwich (which is like the French dip at Arby's) and Alex A. got the Cabo Burger (which is sort of like something you can get at Carl's Jr.). The prices were normal and each sandwich/burger came with a side and a pickle. I love pickles, so that's a plus. My sandwich was pretty amazing. It came with horseradish, and I loved it so much. I put so much on each bite, I was crying. The bread was nicely toasted. The steak was a little dry, but nothing the dip couldn't fix. My coleslaw was pretty meh, but I've never been a huge fan of coleslaw.  Alex let me have a bite of his Cabo burger and I was immediately jealous I didn't get that instead. But maybe it was for the better because I can't handle spicy food for the life of me. The bread was so soft and everything just melted together in a glorious messy concert of meat and greens. His fries were actually called freedom fries. I didn't know the whole replacing thing \"French\" with \"freedom\" thing actually caught on. But I think it made the fries taste less good.   I didn't really like the restaurant itself. It was overly dim and it was hard to see. I did like the way the waitresses dressed in daisy dukes and boots. Overall, I had a good experience. I probably won't be coming back, but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place has a nice layout and good bands on the weekends. The food I've had has always been very good. The biggest issues are the mediocre service and that everything is priced too high. I really don't think that a tall beer is worth $9 just because some singer owns the place."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went into this bar on a Friday night.  I've had friends who had okay experiences, and I personally have been in there once before and it wasn't terrible, so it had potential, I guess.  I got my first drink from the bar and chatted with my friends, went to the restroom, got a new drink and went to the patio, where I was immediately accosted by two large bouncers (I'm a pretty small girl) who told me I was stumbling, belligerent, slurring, and disruptive, and I had to leave.  Despite all my efforts to have a rational conversation with them about what I could have possibly done wrong (since I'd been on the patio for about six seconds before they asked me to leave), they were rude and, frankly, pretty mean.    This bar is not busy enough to be throwing out all of their bar patrons, to be honest.  We went over to Cactus Moon, who not only treated us much better but also said this happens at Toby's pretty often.  Drink at your own risk, I suppose.  The risk being that you might buy an overpriced drink and be forced to leave most of it behind.. that's one (super shady) way to make money in a struggling bar!  :)"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place as I am a Toby fan ... Cool atmosphere , BUT slow slow slow service . Don't go in starving !! We waited 40 minutes to get our food , nothing special ... 3 burgers and a grilled cheese and fries.  The food was descent , not great enough to go back though.  I can now say \"been there done that\" ."}
{"text":"Expect no service pretty much at all. That includes the bar. We hunted for anyone to help us for a long time. One poor guy in our party is still waiting for his food long after we have all eaten. The staff is poor and don't really care. I only left a tiny tip and they didn't deserve that. JUST STAY AWAY! Listen to his music at home and have a beer from the fridge and save the hassle!"}
{"text":"This place is huge, like GINORMOUS huge. Live music on the weekends which is fabulous for two stepping. The bartenders are really great and even the security guys were awesome. We got pretty whacky and they put up with us! My only issue is location, because there isn't much else around. Albeit, when going out two stepping, you're more than likely not looking to migrate anyway. Overall TK's is a good time!"}
{"text":"Wow.  That was your wife.  I thought that was very inappropriate because the guy was pushing on her so I think she got tired of it and threw here beer in his face.  I thought is was ridiculous that the bouncers came in and dragged her out.  It was like they were picking on a baby Panda Bear.  Anyways, I kinda of agree.  Like the music there, Like Toby Keith, but some of his bouncers are kinda woman beaters."}
{"text":"Stopped by after ASU vs Colorado football game on a Saturday night.  Arrived around 8 PM and seated right away.  Little taken aback when we discovered our server was wearing a diaper.  Celebrating Halloween.  Once he got past the baby talk, he was an excellent server.  The food was very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have never had a good restaurant experience at Toby Keith's. There was a time, when literally EVERY order I placed, whether food or drink came back wrong. Not to mention the servers are a bunch of ASU chicks that are too hot (in their own minds) for their own good, and thus the attitude reflected. Ate there last night...ordered a hamburger. 45 minutes later I received my burger which was mediocre at best. Toby....stick to playing bad music!"}
{"text":"We to went to see Jake Owen and were disappointed!! Way to over sold!! Crowded!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the two others that were in town and this was pretty much the same vibe. I was there to see two friends before they left for the summer and We mostly hung out on the patio which was smaller but had some nice patio furniture. I'm never one to leave with out closing my tab but it was closing time and we were saying goodbye as their uber arrived and it slipped my mind. I realized the next morning and checked my account and they had closed my tab of $15 dollars. So I called to go pick up my card and to my surprise they said they did not have it which means they probably threw it away(why!?)... but it just seems sketchy. I quickly canceled my card and am still waiting for a new one to arrive which is a bit of an inconvenience. I might go back if there was a show or to meet up with friends but wouldn't plan to go there myself on a normal night."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Toby Keith's and Saturday. When we pulled into the parking lot we could smell all this wonderful aroma and thought we were in for some good food.  We were disappointed. The salad had been sitting in the bowl for hours as it was wilted.  The broccoli that was served with my chicken fried steak tasted like it had just been taken out of the bag and put in the microwave, Rubbery and dirty tasting. The chicken fried steak was nothing to write home about. My husbands hamburger was dry and well done. The onion rings on the burger turned out to be one giant ring. For $42 plus a tip we good have gone to Cracker Barrel AND the movies!!! Plus we would have had a much better meal.  I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Way to expensive for bland unoriginal food. I had the Cowboy Burger which had a small dot of BBQ, had to ask for extra. The beef didn't taste fresh and was not well spiced. The staff was attentive but not very friendly. I have no plans on going back. There are much better options out there than an overhyped celebrity named American restaurant."}
{"text":"Was there last night for a large birthday party. Service was terrible.  Birthday girl and her Dad never got their food, manager was not helpful....."}
{"text":"Water tastes like it's piped in from the Rio Salado.  Lousy beer selection.  Weak tea.  Don't know how the food tastes because I refused to stick around, assuming the disappointing beverage experience was an indicator of quality issues.    Do yourself a favor and walk across the way to Matta's, an establishment with local roots and a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun as long as you love the country scene. I don't drink and still had a blast. We got the appraiser platter, not worth the price! The portion was tiny and the nachos were not like their main nachos and it just wasn't worth it. The waitress we had was super friendly but I'm not a fan of the \"slutty cowgirl\" look. That's not how a true southern woman dresses. The cowboy burger was great and so were the sweet potato tots (no cinnamon)! All around good time and mainly good food! And the kids ate free with the purchase of an adult meal!!"}
{"text":"Hilarious .. looks like everyone else beat me to the punch with this HORRIBLE place!  Where do I begin .. the hostesses at the front were of NO help, so we walked past the ill place tables that were empty to get the bar.  The layout of this place is so bad!!  So we sit down and the bar tenders literally walked past us 20 times with NO ONE asking if we needed a drink/menu NOTHING!  The girl with all the tattoo's was walking back and forth like a peacock showing her feathers. And she had absolutely NO personality.  How do you hire someone like that!!  I thought a few of the \"bartenders\" were bar backs because they were basically doing nothing and never asked us if we needed anything.  Once we FINALLY got a drink, they were weak and expensive.  Then we had to yell at one of the \"bartenders\" for a menu .... I'm not joking.  We ordered wings and nacho's.  The EIGHT wings came out cold ($12.00) and we sent them back.  The nacho's came out with the wrong topping .. sent them back.  They came back with a load of pork just thrown on the top.  HORRIBLE.  Oh, and those were $12.00 as well.  Ok, as we sat there and laughed at the \"bartenders\" all just sitting there and talking amongst themselves, the band (after warming up for an hour) starts and .... you go deaf.  It is so loud you just sit there and stair at each other.  We finally left after begging someone for our check.  This is the first time I have left a $0.00 tip in my life.  It was that bad.  Oh, and then on the way out the two bouncers (not sure why they were there as there was no one in line) and I got in an argument about how horrible the place was ....   This place will be closed in 6 months.  Zero Stars should be a ranking."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I stopped by the restaurant at the Bass Pro Shop and noticed Toby Keith's. It is across from a cigar store I want to try as well, so I decided to check it out sometime. Yesterday was that time. I arrived about 8:30 pm (Saturday) and the place was packed. I didn't plan on trying to food - just checking out the bar portion.   The place was huge! The bar was long, had several beers on tap, bottle of various alcohols and was well-staffed. And the people! It was not quite wall-to-wall, but it was very full and continued to get busier as the night went on. I ordered a beer on tap and was amused to see it arrive in a large mason jar. Too bad mason jars do not have handles, but it worked. It was $6 for the beer.   I am not a fan of country, but the place was cool. I know some of Toby Keith's songs, and they played a few. There was a band called Whiskey Drunk that performed. Good band with good songs, not too many slow songs, which was unfortunate for me. I am not familiar with the country dancing so when I did dance with someone it wasn't pretty. The impressive thing about the bar was that it attracted all types of people. You had your cowboys, people of all races and ages. Many bars only draw in the young crowd and the occasional creepy old man like me, but anyone would fit in here. There were plenty of 20 somethings, but there were just as many 30-somethings, 40somethings and 50 somethings. I also saw a couple probably well into their 60's hanging out and the lady was dancing and having a blast.  One of the downsides was limited seating. Plenty of spots around the bar and some tables scattered throughout, but with the number of people, I was standing where I always felt in the way. Maybe I am getting old, but it was a little loud too...there are bartenders that were doing various moves with shots and when they would, another person was blowing a whistle, the crowd went wild and they did whatever they were doing. I did see the bartender dim the lights juggle flaming bottles and blow fire. That was cool! I couldn't quite see down to the other end of the bar (that's how long it was), but I think there was another guy down there doing the same thing.  I might need to watch some CMT, but I will definitely go back. This place is hoping on the weekends for sure."}
{"text":"dear toby, thanks for lunch.  love ya, man! ally  are you aware that as a member of the military, toby keith is willing to pay for my lunch at his restaurant?  heck yeah, my homie toby bought me a ROCKSTAR burger, fries and drink.  the whole meal was super tasty, simple but tasty...i got an assload of fries with my moist burger, toppings on the side.  i know it sounds silly, but toppings on the side makes me happy...it makes me feel like i am in control.  this pleases me.  i showed up here as the place opened, so my fellow soldiers and myself were seated quickly, brought our drinks (although, no sweet tea in a country singer's bar & grill?!  SRSLY?!  tsk tsk, toby), told about the free lunch deal and placed our orders.  food was out quick, no fuss and the waitress was on time with drink refills.  and although i'm not a huge fan of the outfits, my male companion was.  i mean, i don't particularly like to stuff my face while staring at borderline anorexic girls in cut off shorts so short they remind me of the sluts i hated in high school.  wear em if you are walking the streets, ladies, not if you are serving me my grub."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and was the worst and has forced me to reconsider ever visiting Toby Keith's in Mesa. The wife and I walked in on a Sunday afternoon (slow, I understand that) and the sign said, please wait to be seated. We waited, and waited, and waited. I bartender on the other side of the bar finally realized someone had walked in and asked if we wanted a table or sit at the full service bar. We said we wanted a table. He then hunts for a waitress who asked us \"did you just want to sit at the bar?\" What a great attitude she had! Finally we are seated at the corner of the restaurant.  I didn't time it, but both of us read through the menu, took our time to decide what we wanted, then read over the announcement cards and whatever else was on the table. After that time had passed, not one person came over to take a drink order. We noticed the one waitress stop another waitress and ask if we were her table. The second one said no and both of them continued on their way. We continued to wait for a few more minutes and looked around the restaurant. There was only two other booths occupied. Was was a family of three and the other consisted of two employee of the restaurant and a manager with a laptop in front of them.  We sat there and discussed the fact that this is a huge bar with hardly any customers in it. Wouldn't you think that you'd have a server that much faster because their job is based on tips? I mean seriously! I've been in a similar industry and understand how operations work and this was pitiful. We both agreed that we've had enough and were so hungry we couldn't wait. We got up and walked out casually and not one employee of this restaurant said anything to us not even notice we were leaving. So pathetic!!!  The only thing keeping me from leaving 1 star is the fact that this was not my only visit. With that said, my other two visits only brought my 1 star to 2. Think about it..."}
{"text":"I absolutely abhor this place. The service is the worse I've ever seen. They have a niche clientele that maybe think the trashy waitresses and freedom fries are cool but I feel highly uncomfortable here and wish I never knew it existed and the food is chilies equivalent."}
{"text":"Thought I would check it out. Totally not impressed! Food is not fresh and overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great lunch n service. Very relaxed place at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Our bartender Kayla made our experience so much better than it would have been otherwise.  She was awesome and we'll be back to see her!!"}
{"text":"Worst management ever!  I'll keep this short and sweet... I walked up to the establishment for my first time very excited because I have never been and I'm a huge fan of the country atmosphere.  As soon as the line moved up I kindly asked the manager if I could use the ATM inside to pay our cover charges.  The guy gos \"have you been drinking?\"  I said yes sir I had a beer at my house before coming here why?   Well you smell like booze I can't let you in.... 1 beer?!!!! Don't you drink at bars?   Walked away.  That being said I took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"There were cheap whores in slutty outfits making God awful faces. SLuts should be strippers. They work less and make more. Same outfits. I left."}
{"text":"TEEKAY TEEKAY TEEKAY TEEKAY!!!  I love Toby Keith's Bar and Grill!  I've been coming here on and off for a while now, mostly on Friday nights after work.  Toby Keith's is pretty cool for a country bar, and I really enjoy my time here when I come in.  It's clean and quite large!  The bar is in the shape of a guitar, with plenty of seating throughout.  One half of the place is more of the bar, with a stage, and a fancy sitting room where I think is reserved for special band appearances.  I've seen people in and out of there, but only on occasion.  There's also a great patio area, with plenty of outdoor seating.  They have a bull you can ride, two nooks that sometimes are rented out for bachelorette parties, taken up by radio stations, or whatever else you would want to use a group setting for.  I really enjoy my time here, but on the down side, they don't have great happy hour food specials.  Their drink specials are okay, but nothing on the food.  :-(  Great live bands, service is so so, and its an awesome place all around.  Give this place a chance if your in the area.  Its an awesome, clean large NICE country bar!!"}
{"text":"The concerts here are wonderful. They bring in some great acts. Getting service at the bar can be a joke but the food is decent. The appetizers are the best, fried pickles, worlds largest nachos, etc! I just can't ever seem to get really good service. Once you track down a bartender it is hard to get them to come back. And I always tip very well so it is very dissapointing for a place I love to come for concerts."}
{"text":"I have never been understanding of people. If you are being served by a waitress for over an hour, do you really try to pay at the bar? Have you ever ate in a restaurant before? This is not a Denny's. Even worse, the waitress was in close proximity. Fun Country bar though."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and to see if we would enjoy coming here for an evening of live music and dining. I couldn't relax and enjoy the experience because everything I touched had something sticky on it. We sat at a different table and it was no cleaner. For me cleanliness is is must have. Sorry we won't be able to enjoy an evening here."}
{"text":"Food was great!  5 Steaks and every one was perfectly cooked and flavorful!  Service was a little slow for a slow house though, so 4 stars."}
{"text":"Expensive for my liking between cover charge and the price of drinks. I'd say it is worth it though for the awesome live music and country girls running all over the place.   I'm docking one star: In the bar's namesake song, Mr. Keith utters the line, \"No cover charge.\" That, sir, is bullshit!"}
{"text":"I'm sure my kind of experience wasn't rare and most definitely contributed to the very sudden closing of Toby Keith's!  What a shame too, they had the best fried okra and chicken fried chicken around!!"}
{"text":"More like a giant nightclub vs a hole-in-the-wall bar."}
{"text":"Went there for a staff lunch. Ordered the wings (buffalo) , and the 16oz. Rib eye. Wings where awesome cooked right and extra sauce. Server was struggling but food came out and of course my medium steak was well done. Finally for to send it back and got a new one. They took care of my wings and I got a decent steak."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Mesa. They have something going every night, with a live band playing most nights. The cover band, Zona Road is fantastic. They do a great free live band karaoke on Wednesday nights, which is also another great night to come if you are wanting to learn country dancing and two-stepping. They make the karaoke a contest where you can win gift cards and tickets to upcoming shows.  Be prepared for a very crowded house and cover if you are coming on a Friday or Saturday night.  They also serve beer in mason jars, which is a super fun novelty. The service is hit or miss, be prepared to wait a while for a drink if you can make it there."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  The bartender and entire bar were in complete chaos. The bar staff was completely inattentive. It took them 3 times to get a grilled chicken and vegetables dish right and I never even got the final grilled chicken ."}
{"text":"If you like Country Music then you should \"LOVE THIS BAR\". I don't..."}
{"text":"They aren't even busy and it takes 15 mins to get a drink. Toby, you need a new bar staff. Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"Terrible food!! Omg!! Our bartender was awesome! Didn't get her name! Super cute girl! Super good service!"}
{"text":"First time there a week ago and I wasn't very impressed. I'm not a country fan but was willing to give it a try.     The good points: I guess the now serve coors products.  Watching drunk people try to bull ride is fun.  Live band and dance floor.  While the band on the night I went wasn't the best, I did appreciate that they played more pop style country.   The crowd that night was not very country.  The age range was also a benefit, you can find young and old alike.     The bad points:  horrible to find close parking if you are not there early, line for the lades room comes with a 10-15 minute wait, so ladies get in line early if you have to pee real bad ;).  Price for draft beer was a little too high.  Very little seating.   I might be willing to come back during the day and check out the restaurant.  So I can use my 1/2 price appetizer coupon."}
{"text":"Toby Keith,  Really, the restaurant business is not for you. Stick to the music.  Very, very disappointed and what a let down for a Military Veteran......  Seriously, the High Street location in Phoenix is just down right terrible. The Staff doesn't have a clue.  Although the location seems to be an ideal spot, there is some definite room for improvement. This place needs a complete overhaul, if not this location is sure to fail like some others.  Come on Toby, make a change for the better and get a KNOWLEDGEABLE STAFF at this location.  From a \"LEDOUX\""}
{"text":"We went into the restaurant. We sat at a table for dinner. NO ONE ever came over to wait on us. We saw a lot of people working. There were only maybe 20 guest, so I was amazed that they can afford having their guest walk out un-served.  I said something to one of the servers and who didn't  truly care and when we walked out the front door there were 6 employees standing around chatting to each other."}
{"text":"Toby Keith's looks like a fun entertainment spot, but it is definitely not a choice food destination.  The food is always just a bit off here and it just doesn't taste or smell quite right.  The portions are large, but everything is greasy from the potato appetizers to the fries, burgers and BBQ.  I've tried Toby Keith's now twice using Groupons and I can't say that I will ever return.  My wife took out the remainder of her burger and fries in a foam container and it sat in the car while we took a 15 minute detour into Walmart and we were assaulted by a rancid, acrid smell when we opened the car door that reminded us of bad grease , old french fries and nasty, wet socks all rolled into one.  Needless to say the leftovers were donated to a tr ash barrel just a few minutes later.  If you do decide to eat at Toby Keith's, a couple of things to do:  1) sit as close to the bathroom as possible; 2) stock up on extra soft, highly absorbent toilet paper, 3) stock up on your favorite antacid and 4) stock up on Fabreze."}
{"text":"I (used to) love this bar, but it's gone downhill in terms of service and clientele. We went out for a friend's birthday last night and I was surprised to find that a bar that prides itself on being a neighborhood-type, country bar now charges a cover. (For guys, at least.)  I love the live band and last night was no different. They rocked. I was disappointed to find that the crowd was nearly half the size of what I remember though. The place used to fill up. Maybe it's the cover that's turning people away?   Or maybe it's the bad service....  At the end of the night, we had a difficult time flagging down one of the many bartenders to close our tab because they were preoccupied with cleaning up. When we finally got one's attention, she rolled her eyes, asked for our last name and then replied: 'You opened your tab wayyyy on the other side of the bar.' She rolled her eyes again and then reluctantly fetched it, because, you know, that's her job, and then slapped it down on the bar top before us without so much as a thank you.  We noticed there was a charge for a Jack Daniels ($8.50 for one BTW. Forgot to mention that their prices have gone up.) we never purchased and when we brought this up to another bartender, we got the same amount of attitude and not a single apology.   I've worked in the service industry and certainly understand how, at the end of the night, you're more than ready to clean up and get out of there, but that's no reason to treat your patrons so poorly, especially since the crowd appears to be thinning.  I don't know that we'll be heading to Toby Keith's anytime soon. I'll take a good DJ over their fabulous live music if it means I'm tended to by a mixologist who makes me feel welcomed and appreciated. And maybe one who smiles. :)"}
{"text":"Was not what I was going for. I really think that the restaurant needs to be reviewed and revamped. Ask people what they want on the menu and don't want. Please change the chicken tenders to actual chicken with some breaking instead of breaking with some chicken. Please use seasoning when cooking your burgers. Very bland and so not worth the money. I seriously doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice and friendly. Food got to our table quickly. Burger tasted okay, the Mac and cheese was delicious though. We would come back but probably try something different food wise. Next time."}
{"text":"SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE AKA STEALING!!!  We came in around 3p for an early dinner after the gym.  Place almost empty.  My daughter ordered a burger well done.  It was out in less than 10 minutes, totally pink inside.  We asked for it to be taken back and cooked to well done.  She brought it back out and said we wouldn't be charged.  Ok, that was considerate and appropriate, but we did NOT ask for that, nor would we have.  My SW salad was passable.  The service was passable.  When she brought the bill, I gave her cash.  She brought back $1.00 instead of the $1.37 that was due us.  We asked the server about it and were told \"we round up.\"  WHAT???  This is the most unethical thing I have ever seen a restaurant do and I am appalled.  Since when is it okay to keep people's money, even if it's 37 effing cents???  Now, if she would have asked me first, \"we like to round up the bill and give the change to charity\", I'd be perfectly fine with that.  Nothing about giving it to charity mentioned.  And, if they said that now, I wouldn't believe it.  What if every business in America did that, or even just every restaurant?  They must be making a hell of a lot of money in what they \"round up\" and you know it's not reported to the IRS because the bill wasn't \"rounded up\".  At the end of the day, they clearly have more money than receipts.  I wonder whose pocket that goes in?  If Toby Keith owns this place, he needs to make some serious policy changes.  I took the high road and tipped the server extremely well in spite of this BS, but I won't be back.  I won't give a dishonest establishment my business."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say about this place.  I hate it in principle.  I hate Toby Keith, I hate his music, the things he sings about, his portrayal of \"American\" and how \"Americans\" should be.  I don't like the guy at all.  I do, however, like a good bar that plays country music and I love bbq.    So the perfect storm of a restaurant presents itself in \"I Love This Bar\" - an Ikea-sized restaurant with a bar the size of an aircraft carrier.  There are TVs all over the place and waitresses in skimpy cut off jeans and boots.  This place definitely has potential.  The bbq chicken wrap (I was shocked they had a wrap!) that I ordered came out very quickly and was pretty good.  It came with the option of \"freedom fries\" but I will never in my life order anything named \"freedom\" so I got potato salad.  It was pretty basic, mustard base, and not bad.  All in all, a pretty decent meal.  The price, on the other hand, was outrageous.  I couldn't really figure it out.  Even totally the cost of all the TVs in the place I couldn't justify such expensive food.  Now that I see military people get free food, I see the rest of us are footing the bill.  What a joke.  It's not enough that they get perks in every other aspect of life or that mindless idiots give them standing ovations at baseball games, now I have to pay to feed them...AGAIN!  My tax dollars already feed them, and clothe them, AND house them!  Nothing against military people, but for a bunch of people who tend to be anti-socialists, you sure do love having the rest of us cover you.  I will not be back to Toby Keith's.  I went to be ironic.  I went, that's that.  Now I can say I've been and how hilarious it was."}
{"text":"The burger and freedom fries were PERFECT!  The place was great, fun.  The service was excellent.  Had a great time.."}
{"text":"Service was hit/miss and the lay out is not great.  Tables are behind the bar and don't give a good view of the stage.  Acoustics aren't great either.  We sat way far from the stage and still had to yell at each other to hear.  Live music was decent otherwise and the crowd is good, large age range. Food and drinks are the same as any other Toby Keith's."}
{"text":"They play two types of music here: country and western.  This place is huge.  If you like really loud (so loud you will not be able to have converstaions) country music then you will love it.  There is a cover on nights with a band- guys paid $5 and girls were free the night I came.  They have some really cool private rooms- one has glass and leather couches and a private bartender.  I wonder how much that one costs?"}
{"text":"Well..... I don't love this bar. I went with a friend last weekend to get some drinks and the place was busy. We couldn't sit at the bar, so we got a table. The place is loud, and got progressively louder as the night went on, solely because someone kept turning the country music up louder and louder, it did not seem like there were significantly more people in the place. Country music is not my thing, but I can't judge on that because I knew what I was getting into in that department. We both started with long islands, which my friend really liked because it was more lemonade -y, but I didn't like so much because I like the long islands that have more of an ice tea ish flavor... less lemon. It was fine, and it also got me tipsy, so I can't complain that much I guess. Then she ordered some blue drink off of their signature cocktails and I got a margarita. The blue was soooooooo nasty.   I mean, this thing was bad.   I don't know who made up the recipe, but it was unlike anything I have ever tasted.... and not in a good way. My margarita was a typical low end margarita, it had sweet and sour mix and cheap tequila. It was not good, but it was what it was. When we got the bill, I was a little shocked that each drink cost 8$.... for real? That is super high for bars in phoenix... especially for ones in Mesa. Cactus moon next door practically gives away their drinks.... and it's basically the same bar. Oh well, now I know for next time.   Oh, PS We had to pay a 5$ cover charge to go to this place (Really?!?!) because they were 'having a band.' Well, we got there at 8:30 and left around 10 and there was no band to be seen. That was a little frustrating.   PPS if you want to see some of the sparkly -est, most short shorts you have ever seen, this is the bar for you."}
{"text":"Sorry, Toby, I can't say I love this bar & grill. Today was my first experience at this much-hyped establishment.  Hubby & I stopped by for lunch with a gift card in hand. The place was a ghost town. I have to say, though, that I was impressed by the neat guitar-shaped bar.   I liked that they have an offer on here when you check in for 50% off an appetizer (excludes Toby's Platter). We got the nachos with chicken. There was a fair amount of guacamole, sour cream, & chicken on them. The nachos were definitely lacking in the cheese and bean department, though. The salsa that accompanied the nachos was decent. The chicken was kind of dry. Ick.   I also liked that weekdays they have happy hour from 11 am to 7 pm. Hubby got a couple $2 drafts, and I had two watered down house margaritas on the rocks for $4 a pop. Frozen margaritas are advertised as the happy hour special, which was what I wanted, but our waitress said the machine used to make those wasn't working. How unimpressive.   They also have select appetizers for $5 during happy hour. We wanted to try the fried Mac & cheese. I had high hopes. Not sure why. These did not meet my expectations. All I tasted was \"fried\". Had I not bit into one & checked out the guts, I never would have known there was Mac & cheese inside.   I ordered the southwest chicken salad as my entrée. I was disappointed in it. For just under $12, the size of the salad itself was pathetic, never mind the lack of beans, corn, peppers, and tomatoes. Is there a black bean shortage here?! The salad was also supposed to have candied pecans. There were zero on the salad I was served. I didn't complain...I saved a few calories this way (way to rationalize, right?), plus our waitress was not the most attentive. My husband got the turkey melt. He said it was fine, although he did leave some overly-crusty crusts behind.   Of course, I had to finish my Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill experience with some fried twinkies! Couldn't wait to try these things! The twinkies turned out to be my favorite part of this restaurant. Granted I was just about in a food coma at this point and my arteries were screaming for me not to do it!  Not exactly in a rush to get back here. If I ever return, I'd like to come at night, maybe for a show, to get a different perspective of the joint. But after reading some of the other reviews, I'm fearing I'll still have complaints, but just of a different variety."}
{"text":"Not for groups. The bar was empty. They would not let us push 2 four tops together for a group of 7. No pushing tables together. We used the bathroom & left. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Most def a 5 star place. They do know how to take care of people here!"}
{"text":"Hurray!  I no longer have to drive to Vegas to sit at Toby Keith's bar!  Because \"I LOVE this bar\" so much in Vegas, it's a bit disappointing to see that this location is lacking the oomph I'm so used to.  I know that they haven't had their official grand opening yet, and so I'll give them a break.  I heard one of their bartenders lights the bottles of liquor on fire and breaths fire too!  That's hot!  We ordered dinner at the bar because we love to watch the bartenders work their flair.  Disappointment, #1.  There was no flair to be seen and there were people sitting around the bar ordering drinks. There was a bartender that was half heartedly practicing a lame move with an aluminum bottle and mixing cup- that was it!  NO personality anywhere to be found.  We ordered a beer, not much flair to that.  Lots of beer on tap, 3 different Heffe's.  Love that!  My hubby ordered the pulled pork sandwich that comes with fries and a side of hush puppies.  I was feeling wily and ordered the fried chicken with fries and mac & cheese.  The pulled pork was the winner on the night.  Comes with fresh cole slaw piled on top just the way we like it.  My chicken dinner was four pieces of chicken that must have come from a farm facing foreclosure = disappointment #2.  My husband was starving, which was one of my reasons for ordering this meal- to give him 1/2.  Disappointment #3 was that both orders of fries were cold and so was my mac and cheese.  My bartender was angry when we told her this.  She said that an earlier customer had ordered the fried mushrooms and they were still frozen inside.  Not good.    The reason that I gave the 3rd star is because they redeemed themselves.  The fries and mac & cheese that replaced the others were brought out in a timely manner and were HOT!  Hopefully, none of the staff had swine flu in the kitchen and decided to spit in my mac.  Always a fear on returns.  I've seen the movie \"Waiting!\"  I'm also of the opinion that the manager should come over when ever there has been a problem.  If he/she knows about it, I feel better that it won't happen in the future.  I will return to give them a fair chance after the grand opening.  I think they're just working out some kinks.  I know the potential and hope that they'll deliver!"}
{"text":"Great space and extra bonus for the young scantily clad waitress's roaming the place. The food, very forgetful. But, I gather people come here to drink and not expect fine cuisine."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will NEVER be back. My friend had a few drinks but was in better condition than most of the people I saw stumbling around and was escorted out, to our amazement, from the restroom because she was apparently intoxicated. This was because a waitress directed the bouncer to do so. Even the bouncer looked confused when my friend quiet and confused walked a nice straight line out the door. I am in my 30s and spent many a night during my 20s hugging toilets in bars and never had anything like this happen when it should have. She wasn't even gone from our table for more than 5 min when this happened.  So... Apparently if u spend over 30 seconds in the bathroom, u WILL be escorted out! Crazy , most bizarre situation ever! NEVER COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"this place took years to finally open and when it did it is a huge area with a massive bar and an untrained, unattentive staff that is more concerned about flirting and talking to one another then actually helping out customers. The bar area was very dirty and cluttered with employees personal things on the bar as well as other items that did not belong in the area. it took a long time to get some drinks and it was fairly empty. this comes down to poor training and management I don't think Toby Keith would love this bar and grill."}
{"text":"Second time here a week later and things have actually gotten worse. Still no draft beer. Food has gone downhill. Do NOT order the chicken fried steak. Under cooked and fatty. Our server last week was pleasant, this week very average. After three mistakes with our food and the check she could barely apologize and didn't thank us.   This place has a long way to go considering they were supposed to be open last July. Not enough time to work out the kinks?  Better food, better staffed and since this is all happening after all this time, better management. If it doesn't improve soon it will go the way of McFadden's."}
{"text":"Can you burry me in a coffin full of Toby's Mac & Cheese? My life would be complete if so. I didn't have a taste for much else on the menu or the bull or the waitress uniforms but the Mac & cheese is to die for. . More? Yes please! !"}
{"text":"Service isn't great.  Beer is good and cold.  Food is terrible, and my stomach has been turning flips since I dined here for lunch today.   We will not be retuning to Toby Keith's!"}
{"text":"Yikes, for being attached to such a large name they really aren't too hot. Not something most people would complain about, but they over pour drinks to the level of filling a red solo cup with alcohol. Would have loved that in high school, now that I'm a grown adult... That's just reckless.   The security thought they were cops, and were more worried about me than the girl who was white girl wasted on the bench. The worst part? The cab driver is the one that pointed that out to me. Oh well, first time there, last time there. They'll likely be closed soon like the rest."}
{"text":"While we were out in Tempe, the husband and I were at a complete loss as to where we should eat.  I did a little yelping and sheepishly mentioned this place.  Now, we like country music and all, but I steer very clear of Toby Keith stuff.  I don't care for the in your face American Pride type stuff.  Anyway, we made out way to the restaurant, with entrances in front and back, and smelled the delicious bbq aroma floating in the air.  This place is HUGE!  I noticed that the capacity is just about 1000 people.  That is nuts.  there is a huge bar running down the middle and a ton of TV's spaced no more than 4 feet apart running all along the bar and all along the roof.  It's a good place to watch a game or the music videos.  I feel like I should also add that there is apparently a dress code for the servers.  All the girls are supposed to wear jingly black cowboy boots, super short denim shorts or skirts, skimpy tops that sometimes show too much skin on a less that perfectly built body, and a super sparkly rhinestoned out belt with a big ol buckle.  As far as the menu goes, the layout and look of it kind of suck.  I heard from our waitress that they are re-doing it, so let's hope that it will be for the better.  Almost everything on the menu actually looks like something I would order.  It's all pretty simple BBQ style stuff with some sandwiches and salads and some pricier entrees.  The appetizer menu looked delicious all around.  I laughed out loud when I read that there were deep fried twinkies on the dessert menu.  Classic.  I ordered the Oklahoma BBQ Beef sandwich with coleslaw as my side.  The sandwich was very filling and tasty.  The meat was juicy and the sauce was sweet and tangy.  The bun could have been more substantial but it was more than made up for with the yummy fried onion strings.  The coleslaw was just blah but I sampled the husband's potato salad and it was delicious!  Simple and tasty.  Overall experience was pretty good.  Our waitress was nice and gave an honest opinion when we asked for one.  The atmosphere was kind of dull but that would probably be because we were there at such an odd time.  In case you were wondering, in the 30-45 minutes we were there, I counted 6 Toby Keith songs.  If I were into guns and in your face patriotism I would probably give this place 4 stars."}
