{"text":"The Dinner Detective is new to Charlotte, but you'd never know it from the quality of the whole experience. It's very different from the murder mysteries I had been to before, in that the whole audience was involved, some of whom were part of the cast. So you didn't know if the people at your table were there for the show, or part of the script! The room at the airport Sheraton was the perfect size for the 8 or 9 tables of 10 people each, and the acoustics were great. The actors were very professional, and they were great at reacting to the audience. Add to all that a very good sit-down dinner, and you've got a night to remember. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very campy and staged.  The cast was easy to figure out.  Over all enjoyed most of it. Food was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!  Do not, under any circumstances, purchase tickets for this show via living social or any other group buying power website.  This vendor is unscrupulous to say the least.  They make it virtually impossible to redeem your vouchers.  I have been trying to find an available show for over a month now. In bad business 101, they limit the number of voucher paid seats available per show.  Currently there are more than 10 shows listed on the website, however they are all listed as sold out for voucher holders.  If you are crafty like myself, you can check the regular priced, non voucher website.....and you'll be appalled at what you find.  Currently, the full price website features over 60 open seats for each show...the same shows that are 'sold out' for voucher holders!  Now I'm not new to the groupon/living social game, but this is ridiculous.  Attempts to contact the vendor have resulted in a \"so sad, too bad\" answer.  Living social will only redeem the vouchers for living social credit so consider yourself warned.   As an avid yelp reviewer I actually checked yelp for reviews prior to buying tickets.  Hopefully this review helps future customers as I believe they are still offering this so called deal..I wish I'd known.  I'm now stuck with 30+ dollar credit, I guess I'll go see if I can buy a mani/pedi, carpet cleaning or house cleaning voucher.  Suck it The Dinner Detective.  Shame on you!"}
