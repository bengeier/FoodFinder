{"text":"We stumbled across 93 after a walk back from the ROM and remembered a favorable review in NOW.

I tried the Lamb and Fig Tangine and I recall that the lamb had a beautiful sweet flavor and slid off the bone. I can't remember what others had around the table but people enjoyed their meals. I think people have to remember that eating in the middle-east is more than pita and d√∂ners. 

The waiter was friendly and enthusiastic (if slightly new and shiny) but he answered all our questions and fairly bounced back and forth.

I recall having a really nice red with the meal--was it Moroccan or from Monaco... whatever, it was slightly off the beaten LCBO path. 

The room is pleasant--nothing too original but not trying too hard either. A good place to bring your parents and sure enough the blue-haired set were out in force. Maybe it's just the Annex? Not that there's anything wrong with that ;-)"}
{"text":"ADDED UNAUTHORIZED TIP TO MY CREDIT-CARD.
I went there with my friend for dinner.
I didn't like the service and didn't leave a tip.
The receipt was the pre-auth one that you need to write in the tip amount.
I've written 0. In my credit card charge, I've discovered later that the waiter decided to 
add himself a tip on my card after we've left.

UPDATE - I've called the restaurant to complain. They seemed reluctant to do much about it, and I told them I'll handle it with the CC company.
Today I've received an aggressive phone call from the manger.
The manager called me and demanded that I will come in person to the restaurant to refund me the money. I found his behavior to be aggressive, as why add an abuse to a theft, and force your customer to commute to the location to refund a credit-card payment (which can be fixed directly with the CC company).
He claim it was a mistake and the waiter thought I wanted to leave him a tip, but forgot. I told him the receipt showed tip: 0 and a total that was equal to the original amount. How can someone \"mistakenly\" thought that I wanted to leave a tip, and \"helped\" me by adding that charge after I've left?
At that point it was obvious to the manager that I'm not buying his story, so he told me \"can you do me a favor? don't come to this restaurant ever again, and tell all of your friends not to come here. We don't like CHEAP people\".
I've decided to grant him that favor and share this advice with my online friends.

So to sum it up, the restaurant ran a scam and added whatever tip they thought they are entitled to the bill, and assumed I wouldn't check my credit-card charges and got caught.
The way the owner chose to manage this incident was to harass me over the phone.
I didn't ask him to call me back, (they used caller ID to get my number I assume)
and it seems he only called me to harass and stress me out, so I will try to forget about it, and won't act about it.

I don't like bullys, and I don't like credit-card scams.

Other than that, the food was ok, not bad, but not exciting either.
The portions were too small (we left hungry from a 3 course dinner) and over-priced IMHO."}
{"text":"Went here for WInterlicious. Food was good, but service was not. My group waited about 20-25 minutes for waitress to come take our order. Slow to provide water, had to ask for utensils"}
{"text":"Went to this place with five long-time friends for my birthday last night.

As Ramanan S. mentioned, this is a Middle-Eastern-themed eatery, rather than Middle-Eastern through-and-through. (How else to explain the seafood biryani?) The decor was tasteful and not overdone.

The service was great - our server was attentive enough, and answered any questions my friends or I had about any of the menu items or ingredients.

The restaurant isn't big, but that's just fine. And it wasn't crowded at all, which meant I could hear my friends and didn't have to worry about shouting over any other diners.

To start, we ordered two appetizers - the Baba Ghannouj and the Muhamara. Loved them, along with the olive dip that we also got. 

For the main, I ordered the Cornish Hen with couscous. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. The hen was so tender and the couscous was fantastic. A couple of my other friends had fish - tilapia and salmon - and they loved it.

On the whole, I agree with all my fellow Yelpers who've previously reviewed this place. Whether you're here on a date, or with a group of friends, you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"What a great winterlicious choice! Like the previous review I also had: 

The grilled calamari: It was smokey and lovely and not overcooked at all.

The fig and lamb tagine: This was my favourite part of the meal. The meat was tender, and the figs added a lovely sweetness. I'd go back just for this!

Walnut and Pear Stuffed Phyllo: Small portion of sweetness.

I also ordered a mint tea after the meal which consisted of real mint leaves in a teapot. It was very nice.

Add to that an excellent waiter, and a $25 price tag, and you've got yourself a winner! If I could give 4.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"I went to Harbord 93 and had the worst experience. Our server (also one of the managers) was absolutely horrible. She was in a bad mood from the moment I arrived at the restaurant. Once all my friends arrived she ignored us for an hour (we were trying to get her attention and she pretended not to see us) while she served other guests. Then one of my friends said we should go somewhere else.  Another friend said let's give her five minutes.  She heard this and came running over to our table to finally take our orders. We all ordered our dishes and then waited over an hour to get our food.

Then we noticed that the table next to us who ordered after us received their first and second courses before us. When the waitress brought us our appetizers I casually asked her why they received their meal before us. She then blamed the kitchen.  I can understand how maybe the kitchen messed up but our waitress Francesca (I think that was her name) had major attitude and it wasn't appreciated. She was rude, snarky and definitely not happy to be working there. I would never recommend this restaurant and will never go back."}
{"text":"How can this restaurant not yet have a 5-star rating?  In my opinion, 93 Harbord represents the best of the city: unpretentious, great service and absolutely delicious food - all for reasonable prices.

I go to 93 Harbord whenever I want a special treat.  It's great for a family gathering (we've celebrated many a graduation here) or a romantic date.  The ambiance is laid back, but elegant and clean.

The food is the real star of this place.  My favourite starter is the beautiful beet salad presented on a tidy bed of tasty, lemony wheat bulgar with a stunningly good coriander sauce.  Or, get the taster menu if you're with a bigger group and enjoy little tastes of everything.

The tagines are out of this world.  Vegetarians don't suffer the usual afterthought of a meal.  The veggie tagine is just as delicious as the lamb and couscous with grilled veggies is a great alternative, too.  For fish eaters, the salmon wrapped in the vine leaves is tender, light and seriously delicious.

All in all, this is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Mains are mid-range ($15-$25) and worth every penny.

Vegetarian Score: 8/10. You feel cared for and well-fed, even in a meat-based restaurant."}
{"text":"A Solid 4 - great attempt at authenticity and service was great.

An authentic morrorccan meal with tagines and the fixin's are hard to find, we ventured their 3 course Winterlicious menu for $25 and we were not disappointed!

First off - the bring an OLIVE TEPANADE with fresh warm pita bread, which was deelicious... Everything tasted fresh and made on the spot.

STARTERS: I had the GRILLED CALAMARI - which had the best flavor, it was well-done and wasn't chewy, the calamari just melted in your mouth.  The other starter we had was the BEEF AND LAMB KAFTA KABOB, which tasted like a caseless ground sausage - filled with flavor and laid in saice with fresh pita bread.

MAINS:  We both had the LAMB AND SHIRAZ FIG TAGINE - this was off the hook.  The lamb was well- done, just fell OFF the bone, meat was tender and filled with flavor.  It was served with Couscous and bokchoy.  The flavors marinated together really well and the spices were fresh to taste.

DESSERT:  I had the recommended POACHED FIGS, ALMOND SYRUP AND YOGURT.  This was all right, the yogurt was very thick and creamy, but the figs were a good sweet kick - good for someone that is looking for not such sweet sweets. The clear dessert winner was the WALNUT AND PEAR STUFFED PHYLLO in HONEY DATE SYRUP - which was just divine.  The warm, light flakey pastry was submerged in the sweet honey sauce, topped with fruits and nuts, this dish was to die for/

All and all, this was a great dining experience.  I am not sure if everything was pre-made but the food was super fast.  The service was great, the waitress was really attentive.  I would totally come back again and taste the menu outside of what Winterlicious had to offer.

MUST GO."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Modern Middle Eastern cuisine
Menu items: Grilled Calamari in Turkish Fig Salsa and Lamb and Shiraz Fig Tagine

Today's topic? Figs at 93 Harbord. Ok, a bit of a stretch, but this was definitely my topic ingredient the night I visited this restaurant for the first time.

Figs, spices, fruits and herb-infused dishes is how to best describe 93 Harbord. The location of 93 Harbord (no pun intended) is actually quite unique. Hardly ever Torontonians think of the annex as a Foodies area (or at least I never thought of it), and especially an area that would host modern Middle Eastern cuisine. This city never ceases to amaze me.

Arriving right at dinner time on a warm Friday evening, and having had a few drinks at the bar down the street, we began our trip around the new Middle East with the Grilled Calamari in Turkish Fig Salsa.

As a kid, I used to hate figs; but as I grew older, and as my parents put it - my taste got \"fancier\" (hint for expensive), my love for these little earthy things grew. Figs really go with a variety of salty and sweet meals and they even compliment ingredients that have little taste to them...fish being one of them.
The Grilled Calamari at 93 Harbord was succulent and perfectly cooked, the Chefs, creating their own version of salsa, using traditional Middle Eastern ingredients and injecting it with a hint of modern with what tasted like jalapenos, olive oil, onions, lime juice and cranberries, created a killer sauce. The end result? Perfection.

Following the fig theme, the next big fig dish at 93 Harbord is the Lamb and Shiraz Fig Tagine. Before I go on my description of the plate, I would like to add that the use of any wine reduction on meat is, especially cooking it tagine-style, always a hit. With all the fruits and spices used in Middle Eastern cuisine, mixing modern cuisine with old style cuisine is a great way to transform a meal. Add to it the use of figs on this dish which compliments the flavour, then the introduction of a soft and watery veggie like bok choy (Chinese broccoli), and you got yourself a deliciously balanced meal from begging to end. Now this deserves a Bon Appetit! (Julia Child style).

Buen Provecho,
Foodies Inc."}
{"text":"The food is quite good, and the prices are very reasonable. Everything has a Middle Eastern flare to it, but I wouldn't call it a Middle Eastern restaurant. The decor is very simple. It's a long narrow space with an open kitchen. The wait staff are quite friendly. It's definitely a good place to take a date."}
{"text":"Came here because The Harbord Room was full and we were starving (bummer). I dined, as I usually do, with an open mind, however, and this place has decent reviews on Yelp! 

I totally forgot it was the beginning of WInterlicious! So, a set menu for $25. 

I ordered the grilled eggplant (yummy, with a green sauce made from cilantro and parsley), lamb terrine and the yogurt apricots for dessert. 

My S.O ordered the calamari (chewy), a vegetarian lentil main (alright, a bit boring) and the pear pastry (too sweet).

The food was good, ( I think I got the better combo) but a bit forgettable. (Although my dessert was TINY. Think the size of two dried apricots)

Overall, nothing offended me about 93 Harbord, but I found it lacked in atmosphere, (no music, bland decor) ,which was a stark contrast to the bumping Harbord Room next door. 

Next time!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots on Harbord. I have been a number of times over the years and the quality is always excellent. I took an Iranian friend once, and he said that the food was very authentic and chatted with the chef at the end, when we were getting our coats (there's a semi-open kitchen at the back).  

On my most recent visit, the service lagged just slightly (-1 star). It was a busy Friday night and it took a long time for someone to bring us water, take our order, etc. Reservations are definitely needed on Fridays and Saturdays. The decor is warm and simple, and if there was music playing, I didn't notice it. It's quiet enough to have a good conversation without too much background noise. 

But really, you come here for the food. 93 Harbord is perfect for a special occasion or a fancier dinner, especially when you want to eat (relatively) healthy. My DC and I ordered:
Tomato Avocado Salad with Citrus Mint juice - simple, very fresh
Grilled Eggplant with Parsley and Cilanto Puree - loved this! The sauce added an interesting flavour to it. The eggplant was not too firm, not too mushy -- just right. 
Vegetable and Fruit Tagine - the stew was hearty and chock full of yummy root vegetables as well as apricots. There was just a slight spiciness and fragrance to it. The couscous is so light and fluffy, so you don't feel excessively/uncomfortably full after dinner. 
Lamb and Shiraz Fig Tagine - my DC seemed to really like it, but I didn't try it 

Mmm... writing this review is making me hungry..."}
{"text":"Believe it or not Im sitting here in the restaurant right now compelled to write this review because the service here is completely atrocious. My girlfriend and I have been sitting here for hours waiting on our food and only the appetizers have been served. The wick on the candle has completely burned (those small table candles)... Why we still are here... I have no idea... The waitress is a total smug bitch..."}
{"text":"I'm always of two minds about 93 Harbord, but I will always go back there.

The service is friendly, attentive, yet demure. But not stuffy or pretentious. 

The food is upscale Middle East comfort food, well prepared, but not spectacular. It _is_ very very tasty, though. The lamb tagine is quite good, if a little fatty. The fish special is always a little bland. The shrimp appetizer (\"Seared Shrimp, Cumin Apple Rings, Dill Sour Grape Coulis\") is near perfect. The Grilled Eggplant is very nice.

They just discontinued the best cheesecake in town, which is really sad. The Walnut and Pear Stuffed Phyllo is the next best thing.

And they have Arak!"}
{"text":"i should've written this sooner because i can't quite remember all the details. but here goes:

the appetizer sampler is fantastic and an absolutely must have. i'd drop the hummus from my selections of appetizer -- it was only ok.

the server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. we could've just listened to him talk all night. their drinks selection is great.

the mains were ok. they were not stellar. that is where i dock a point. i tried both tagines, and i just did not find them flavourful enough."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try 93 Harbord for quite some time, and ended up here for a Summerlicious meal last night. I was actually really disappointed with the entire experience, and surprised by the majority of positive reviews.

First of all, when I sat down at the table, I noticed that the fork at my place setting was dirty. And not just kind of dirty, there were huge, obvious grains of couscous crusted between the tines of the fork. THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE COME TRUE. How could this not be noticed by the person setting the tables? When I told my server about the fork, he made some offhand joke about it and brought me a new one right away, but there wasn't really any sort of apology or acknowledgement of fault on their part. Good thing I preen and examine all my cutlery carefully...I also noticed dirty fingerprints about the plates when they came out, which is a pet peeve of mine, but maybe I've just been watching too much Food Network and my standards have skyrocketed.

Onto the food: I started out with the Zaalouk - an appetizer of eggplant topped with chickpeas, tomatoes, and mint. I wish there was some sort of indication that this dish would be served cold, because it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The whole dish was a little oily and didn't have a lot of flavour. My boyfriend started with the shrimp kabob and thought it was fine, but noted that the shrimp were lukewarm at best. For our mains, I had the \"Roasted Cherry Tomatoes with Haricot Vert, Walnut Pearl Couscous Pilaf and Harissa-Tomato sauce\". I thought it was tasty enough, but it seemed a little overseasoned, and pretty one-dimensional. My boyfriend's salmon dish was undercooked, and again, lukewarm. At this point we just wanted to leave, but the redeeming factor was dessert: we shared the Pear and Walnut stuffed phyllo and the poached apricots, which were probably the best part of the entire meal. 

Although the restaurant was only about half full that night, service was pretty slow and patchy, but pleasant enough. Nobody really bothered to check in on us during our meal to see how things were going, and we sat with empty plates in front of us for a little longer than I would have liked. Also, I don't understand why they have nice tablecloths and then put brown paper on top of all the tables - it seemed like such a strange contradiction, and didn't do much to add to the overall atmosphere. 

Unfortunately I can't chalk up the fork, the food, and the service all to the fact that it was a Summerlicious meal, so I won't be returning here again. Too bad - I wanted to like it, but I guess my search for the perfect Middle Eastern restaurant continues!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant tonight with 8 co-workers and had a really good meal. 

Wholewheat pitas with a delicious garlic/lemon dip were on the table right away. I followed this with a Halloumi cheese salad followed by a perfectly cooked and boneless Cornish Hen with couscous.

The service was attentive but left us alone enough and the decor and subtle.

Over all this was a great place to eat with an original menu - check it out."}
{"text":"I'm actually not a right person to write a review because I did not eat anything there. Me and my friends were looking for a place for a dinner, and we saw this place. We forgot to notice the dressing code (but we were in nice coats and shirts still) and we did not notice that we need a reservation. When we went in, the servers were so rude that they just want to kick us out. They use gestures to let us get out, and looked at us as we came to beg for food with those disgusting facial expressions.

I'm so happy to see this restaurant is closed. LOL."}
