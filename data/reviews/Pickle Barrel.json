{"text":"Just went to the Pickle Barrel at Yonge and Eglinten last week. It was a really great experience.  The hostess was a bit slow to come to us, but that didn't really matter because our server, Anthony didnt miss a beat. He was courteous and funny.  The food was pretty good. I got the bacon and eggs and my boyfriend got the triple BLT with the matso ball soup to start.  The bacon and eggs were good as was his BLT.  Anthony was very quick to refill our coffees and our waters....which is shocking since watiers very rarely refill water.  All in all I will come back here based on service and entrees."}
{"text":"The party sandwiches are terrible! Dried out bread and the fillings taste yucky!   To be fair, this is the 3rd time I am trying these sandwiches in the last 2 months and they all taste bad.   The fillings are 1/8 of an inch (.125) or 3.75 mm thick. You need really good eyes to see the fillings. Put on really thin. THE BREAD IS SO THICK!  At $7.99 you get:   3 salmon and egg salad double layer sandwiches 6 tuna and egg salad double layer sandwiches 3 cream cheese, smoked salmon, gherkins pinwheels  STAY AWAY! DO NOT BUY!"}
{"text":"Went last night for a birthday gathering. A few people didn't even eat there main meal it was so tasteless. My salad was terrible, shredded ice berg lettuce with a tasteless dressing and hard to eat because the pieces where so small. Then I thought mussels would be a safe bet but I was wrong the broth was greasy and had not flavor whatsoever with I'm sure frozen tasteless shredded carrots and tomatoes. Couldn't even tell they were tomatoes bits \"no taste to them at all\". Too bad, I was hoping for a nice interesting meal. And I ordered a \"Toronto Margarita\" which they list the ingredients as a traditional Margarita but I was again super disappointed that it was made with a powder or syrup and was terrible and I've tried many in the past and I'd have to say this was the worst. Sorry :(. But they need to make changes here to compete against other restaurants like themselves!! I only gave a star for the wonderful company we had :)"}
{"text":"Went window shopping at Yorkdale yesterday afternoon and decided to have a late lunch at Pickle Barrel.  Restaurant setup was pretty nice, big open eating area and the booths were so comfy.  The washrooms were pretty decent as well, clean and stocked up. Started off lunch with a Pickled Caesar; pretty standard Caesar but the pickle juice gives it a nice touch.  Had the Asian Nachos as a starter and I was pretty impressed!  The only downside to them is that when you get close to the middle of the nachos, they start tasting a little too sweet.   I ordered the Pete's Deli sandwich but I substituted the roast turkey for Montreal Smoked meat.  The sandwich was good, meat was really piled on and the cheddar and thousand island dressing in the sandwich complimented the meats fairly well.  I had my sandwich with sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries. I would return to the restaurant to try other things on the menu, but I wouldn't make it one of my go to's if I was hungry.  CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Once again just terrible, worst pickle barrel in Metro Toronto stay away. Bad service hostess is a joke.restaurant us dirty, just walked out disgusted."}
{"text":"I have been going to pickle barrel for decades.   The food is ok .   They are very far from the dining area and require you to walk down a very long staircase.  They are in a very isolated area.  The fish and chips and the salad was actually bad it take me time to go there again"}
{"text":"this place serves mediocre food with non-wallet buring prices. i guess looking at the menu, there's a variety of foods to choose from but nothing too special that you wouldn't be able to find at any other restaurant. there were soooo many choices of foods to choose from but i ened up ordered the veggie burger and a mango bellini which i would have to say is MASSIVE for $7! i ended up not finishing it but all and all, it was good. veggie-burger was not bad either. not as dry as i was expecting which is a good thing since most places have a tendancy to make it super dry! service was quick and friendly and i had an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I'm torn in my review of this place. I really enjoyed myself here the last time I visited and they have also accommodated a large party close to closing time without complaint. That gets a full 5 stars in my book. The quality of PB in general is not great though. The staff were fantastic, the food passable and generally the atmosphere was pretty generic.    I do like this spot for a good all day breakfast though I wish when I go I could look outside and watch the world go by. It's a great spot but it could do with better food, more unique decor and a better view."}
{"text":"I do enjoy coming here and I come here often with both family and friends. Chicken soup with matzo balls, giant sandwiches fit only for 2, mini desserts and more. The mojitos are a bit big but otherwise this place is great.    One thing that bugs me is that it is underground so there are no windows and no natural light. It is a great place to meet because there is tons of parking for the mall, it is fully wheelchair accessible and everyone can get there easily. Plus there is a whole mall of shopping then a lot of space to store the bags by the table."}
{"text":"Cheap ingredients, lake of taste, nothing attractive in this place. Go at your own risks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating at the Pickle Barrel and loved the convenience of having it directly in the mall after a long day of shopping but it was a little overcrowded and the wait was far too long. Also when we were finally called on we got seated at a mini table for 2 and I could have literally reached out and put my arm around the gentleman sitting at the table next to me, so we have very little room for our glasses and cutlery, etc. Plus we kept getting bumped by the servers as they tried to squeeze between us and the table next to us.  However aside from the extremely long wait and the over crowded dining area we really enjoyed our meal. We both had steaks which were delicious and for how busy it was we we're served really quickly. I was excited to eat here as my parents always took me to the Pickle Barrel for dinner when I was a kid and we went into the city. I have to say all in all it lived up to my childhood memories and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very fancy with a nice sitting area, I ordered some mushrooms pasta and it was ok, but not the best, it was basically a lot of white sauce and seven ravioli sprinkled with mushrooms. I think that for what the product was, it is overpriced.  Their smoothies are good though."}
{"text":"The service is ok, nothing exceptional. I like the location and set up of the restaurant and the food I get is pretty decent. However since 2012 most pickle barrel restaurants (especially this one) get stingy with the tiramisu, so the portion gets smaller with each visit. Call me greedy but the dessert isn't exactly cheap."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Pickle Barrel (all northern locations) my entire life.  It is a place my parents always took us to on either a Saturday or Sunday for family dinners.  When this location opened it was advertised as the chic, higher end version of the Pickle Barrel brand.  I remember how excited everyone was that there was a location opening in Yorkdale!  All I know is that you get the same bland, mediocre food that you get at all other locations, but with higher prices.  The plates are absolutely massive and to make it look like you are getting a lot of food, items are spread out or have a lot of garnish.  I have never eaten a salad there that is fresh.  Food tends to come out dry and with out much taste.  The service is usually extremely slow.  Then you get the bill and wonder what cost you so much.  I know I will continue to eat here for the rest of my life, but I just stick to the all day breakfast menu because while the hash browns taste like they came out of a frozen food box, and the fruit skewer is dry, the eggs are ok.   The coffee is terrible.  Maybe I'll stick to the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The Rose Reisman salmon is to die for. But it's a noisy restaurant, the washrooms aren't particulary clean, and overall it is very outdated location... it needs to be renovated. I want go back to this location... and will stick with the Leslie Street."}
{"text":"Went there for company's Christmas party. The place was very crowded but we had reservations.  The menu is ok, lots of options but the taste is nothing special. Prices are high for what they offer."}
{"text":"We sat down for a couple of drinks and decided to order a plate of nachos. This plate came out half heated, and it was obvious. I asked the server to get us a BRAND new one and in less than two minutes, she brings me one which was evidently the same one they took back. She chose to lie to me and say they made a new one. Reason why? Because I chose to take a picture of the old one and it was the exact same.   She took this back to her manager who after speak to her, took the plate and aggressively threw it onto the table adjacent to him in anger. In addition to all that, the next plate they brought out was absolutely terrible. Were they trying to get back at me for being upset at poorly made food?   Worst part of it all is their corporate office doesn't have the decency to reach out and apologize and call for an explanation. They simply say 'we are sorry and will be retraining management.'  Great? But who's going to call me and explain why that happened and apologize. Don't spend a dime here, worst service and if something goes wrong, they will make it worse for you our of spite."}
{"text":"The food was ok. My lobster grilled cheese was dry and it needed more flavour.  They wer genrous with the amount of \"lobster meat\" in it.  I'm assuming it was crab because it did not have the texture of lobster. I had to add mayo it it.  The chicken and waffles are a tiny portion for the price you pay.  More of an appetizer size. They drizzled too much syrup on it.  It was meh but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Located in Yorkdale next to the Bay, service was great here first we got a table for four but we wanted a booth and they were kindly enough to offer us a booth table. The server we had was excellent, very friendly and very intelligent of all the items on the menu. The food was great but was not a big fan of the asian nachos, i found it a bit too sweet to my likings but nonetheless everything was great!.   I know for sure that they take reservations on weekends or friday nights i believe for large groups. On those days its very packed and there might be a long waiting time."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. The restaurant is well decorated and a nice ambiance. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. I am not able to eat certain foods, she brought out a book with the list of ingredients and made some really good suggestions for me. The food came out quickly and was delicious. They have a wide variety of foods on their menu, including healthy choices. The prices are very reasonable. I really enjoyed this restaurant.  On a side note, this is not a restaurant to stop in for a quick bite. It gets extremely busy during dinner hours. It is more of a restaurant to relax and enjoy good quality food."}
{"text":"What a terribly run location. I have never been a huge fan of pickle barrel, given their much too extensive menu of mediocre food (which comes in the form of a book, literally), but we went for a late lunch at this location out of convenience. We arrived at 3:15, and were seated in a little booth adjacent to a 6-sweater which looked like the guests had just left. It was a total mess with plates still on the table and food all over the floor. Fifteen minutes later, still no one had cleaned it. Two staff members walked by, only adjusting the position of the chairs. One dropped off a broom and dustpan, seemingly with the intention to come back and clean up but this didn't happen. Another 20 minutes later 1 of those staff members finally come back and quickly clean the top of the table and put the broom away without having cleaned the food off the floor. A few minutes later she seated a new party at the same table. Witnessing all of this was quite a turn off; if that is how \"clean\" they keep the dining room of the restaurant, who knows what goes on in the kitchen. And to top things off, our food was mediocre at best. My boyfriend had the steak sandwich, and the meat was so chewy, oily and fatty. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Take your money across the street to the keg or moxies instead."}
{"text":"No stars! Very disappointing take out service. Not enough competent staff, beef was stringy, potatoes had onions tho I expressly requested none. Won't be back ever!"}
{"text":"I went here when it first opened!! The food to now can't even compare, also switched the Menu since it first opened. Personally I liked it better before. I don't frequent here to often any more and the potato locus. If your Jewish you also know these are horrible deep fried impression of them!!"}
{"text":"After a long day shopping of course we got hungry so we went to Pickle Barrel to eat. The waiter came quickly and accepted our order. I got the fish tacos and booooy oh booy! Soo delicious the fish was soo tender and seasoned perfectly.   The service was great. We got our order like within 15 minutes. The location was clean and tidy. We went on a Saturday and surprisingly there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived after the lunch time rush, restaurant was about 30% full. Told the hostess that my time was limited. I was seated at a table that was covered in crumbs. The server was very pleasant and cleaned it quickly. She gave me a menu and I told her that I will order in a couple of minutes...15 minutes later the server was no where to be found so I spoke to another server asking her if I could order. She asked me who my server was and I thought she was going to find her. I then saw the hostess pass by and told her that I've been waiting to order and her answer was that the server was busy. Clearly I was not going to get service anytime soon. I decided to leave and on my way out I told the hostess that I was leaving. She didn't seem surprised and said sorry but the server was busy. I will never return!"}
{"text":"While the Pickle Barrel has quite a sizable menu, I found the quality of the food to be somewhat lacking.  I ordered the Greek Feta Burger, which is a patty on a Greek salad. The burger was way too dry and had barely any taste while the salad seemed to be just some mixed greens with a sprinkle of feta cheese. If the meal wasn't too great, the service was even worse. My food came on  time, but my friend's oysters took forever. The waiter actually brought out two wrong dishes before he finally served the right one. At least he gave us a discount, which was very nice of him.  Overall, meh. Enticing menu, below-average food."}
{"text":"WARNING - Eating at any Pickle Barrel could end up in frustration and disappointment...Just look at the overall ratings of this place!  I have had the misfortune of eating at almost every Pickle Barrel in the GTA over the years (usually through no choice on my part), and in virtually every one, the service or the food or BOTH have been seriously lacking!   A couple of years ago I sent an email to the Customer Service department after one particularly bad dining experience, and even THAT was infuriating, because I never heard back from anyone!  I am amazed that any of these restaurants are still in business.  It seems there is an absence of interest or concern for the needs of the customer from the top person, right on down in this company!  I strongly urge anyone considering Pickle Barrel NOT to eat there!"}
{"text":"We've been here 2 times before the most recent visit. The first time, the service was atrocious, the food was cold, and the waitress got the order half wrong.  The second time we went, the service was a bit better, and the food wasn't half bad.  The third time we went, it was 3 pm in the afternoon on a Sunday. There were about 7 tables with people at them in the entire restaurant. We sat 10 long minutes watching the (what seemed like) lone server clearing tables, bringing one table's food out, and pushing chairs in. She seemed to be more concerned about collecting the money off one table that had already left, than taking our order (or even our drink order). The table behind us got their drinks about 1 minute before their food arrived!  At the 10 minute mark, we knew that this wasn't going to be a good experience and we got up and left. The waitress (who was clearly too old, sorry to say, to be working in a fast paced environment) indicated that the kitchen had been busy. I wondered what that had to do with her simply taking our drink order...?  On top of it all, most of the customers looked like they had been there for 2 hours waiting for service: blank looks on their faces.  I'll never go back, as this Pickle Barrel doesn't treat it's customers with any respect."}
{"text":"Dined here on Friday night. We were a table of three who felt very neglected.   It was a constant struggle to get any attention from our server.  When we did ask for a drink we received no reply, more of a \"tut\". We felt like we were bothering him.  The Menu is like a novel - Much too many options and no obvious speciality.  Again after receiving our mains we were left waiting - in need of drinks with no sign of our server.  The table next to us had a complaint about their meal and the way it was handled was very badly. It caused a bit of a scene with everybody wondering what was wrong. It ended up with the Man and Woman of the table being visually uncomfortable which radiated to the other tables.. It was quite awkward..  On a good note there is construction happening on one side of the restaurant and I like the way it is concealed.. Good Job..  Overall Food was fine.. Service was bad.."}
{"text":"we go to this location very often with my family. Food is good, price is good, service is good too. I got free desert on my birthday."}
{"text":"My parents were shopping in centre point mall and when I went to pick them up they were hungry, first thing my mom wanted was pickle barrel. First of all, my mom walks with a staff because she had a stroke, every single restaurant we went to were sensitive enough to give us a closer seat so she doesn't need to walk too far, and this Pickle Barrel was the first place that sent us all the way to the back when there were plenty of seats in the front, i wasn't sure why but I thought I probably should respect that, turns out other people came in and took those closer seats. THEN, we sat there for more than 15 mins nobody came by to serve, and of course I've pressed that service button a million times and still nobody. Until the lady brings a few people in and sat behind us, and immediately they were served with water, and they got to order before us, after they finish ordering someone came by to ask if we were ready to order.  AND THEN after we ordered, I swear we waited for soooooooooo long that we don't even feel hungry anymore!!!!! Finally when the food came, they forgot about our salad and espresso, I had to remind them when I finally see someone that I can talk to (that's when we were almost finish with our food ).  i couldn't stand being there any longer, i want the bill!!! And again, NOBODY wants to give me the bill, I wondered if I should just walk out ???? When the bill finally came nobody asked if I needed a machine,'when the machine came the dude just left the machine on the table!! I paid and left and still nobody came by, so if I change the amount and just leave nobody would've cared anyways?? Wasted so much of our time,'extremely unhappy to eat there no jokes when I see the 1.5 star review on yelp I wasn't surprised, should've read it before I went in."}
{"text":"Full of senior customers. The food was so so. You are welcome to sit as long as you want and chat with friends after finishing the meal.   The waiter and waitress were very very very friendly and patient."}
{"text":"The food was so so. Service was poor because they were short staffed. Not as cozy as their Leslie location."}
{"text":"Location and decor is great. Service is prompt and well-mannered. The food is where Pickle Barrel fell short; avoid the Paella, it seems microwaved or seriously pre-cooked like a lot of the food here. The rice was stiff and cold and the meats were not much to speak of. I have been for breakfast and it was much better. Overall a good restaurant but food can be bland."}
{"text":"Sabrina, horrible manager. I only got up to making a reservation and I am already repelled by the service they were giving me."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times, never requesting to, but the other day when I volunteered to go with a friend, we received a roasted pepper with a sticker still attached (w. Calamari App), this wasn't as much of a problem, just questioning their prep for the food, but when we bit into the calamari and it was rubbery and cold, we asked for it to be returned. They brought us a new crispy calamari in the same condition, so we didn't end up eating it, not to waste food again, and thinking they'd just take it off the bill anyway. They didn't. Our meal was meh and like my stars \"Eek! Methinks never again\"."}
{"text":"Thursday night @ 6 pm. Terribly slow service. We were just forgotten. With a small hungry child I had to go chasing down a piece of bread. The food was so, so and only served after an interminable long wait. In all, a most unsatisfactory evening. We will never go again. (We have been here before, not better then.)  All you shoppers - go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This location in Brampton is very busy. We waited a long time for a table (had reservations). However, it's worth the wait!. The food/drinks are great, service was prompt. I highly recommend the Asian Nachos appetizer. All main dishes come in generous portions. The menu is extensive, may take awhile to decide, healthy choices."}
{"text":"We were 4th in line at the hostess desk. She asked us all generally if we were tables of two and then said everyone come with me...4 sets of couples then followed her to a section at which time she seated the first couple...and then told the rest of us to follow her to another section where she seated us individually...very strange...I felt as if I was on a tour.  The menu is extensive which is always a worry since there is no way they have all that food fresh...so it's obviously not made to order.  Portions were large which is good if that's what you like.  Server got our food order wrong but I recognised it before he went off to place the order..he wasn't really listening...Food tasted ok..nothing special.  The atmosphere is a bit cafeteria-ish.  Sorry but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i frequent this place often. I have to say that the service is outstanding. The manager once beought out the box of bacon so i could read the ingredients during a time i had food limitations. They are quick, professional, and organized. My favourite dish was the rainbow trout with maple dressing from the rosa reissman menu. I havent seen it featured since last year, but the other menu items are good too. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is becuase of the time one of the waitresses couldn't arrange steamed rice for me when i wasn't feeling well, so i watched my boyfriend eat by himself. Otherwise, the rest of the servers are fantastic."}
{"text":"Definitely a great hangout place for the young and families but food is too off. There are plenty of options and lengthy menus but the taste of the food is either to sweet, salty or bland. Burgers are often dried, Greek food tastes like baby food, steak is alright but the poor vegetables accompanying it , looks that they have been in a steaming sauna. Their pumper nickel bread is a good starter. Prices are too high for just average unsatisfying food. The lengthy food menu definitely is a weak point and reduces quality significantly."}
{"text":"Every place deserves a second chance. We decided to go back and we're pleasantly surprised how much better everything was. The server was pleasant our food came out at resonable time was hot and delicious. We will definitely go back. Jim D"}
{"text":"This. There's no way I can let this one slide. Signed up for Yelp just to post a review of the Promenade Pickle Barrel location. I have been here (reluctantly) many times over the years at this location but tonight this is the last straw for this abysmal mess.  There's nothing good about this location. Understaffed and poor service is the name of the game. Servers go on breaks on a whim. Food that sits on the pass for 10-15 minutes. Always have to send a cold plate back.   It's a real shame.  The other locations throughout the city are OK. Pickle Barrel in general is very mediocre with a large menu and subpar servings in quality and serving size.  There's nothing else to say about this location. Avoid."}
{"text":"Always liked the Pick but lately takeout service sucks. Found the girl to be unfriendly. Ordered a salad for takeout and she gave me nothing. Few lettuce leaves for $10. Not worth it. Be more generous with your serving sizes. Find the takeout service extremely slow. 7 people in line at the time and I waited 35 plus minutes before I placed my takeout order. Service should be quicker and more friendly. Not coming back for a while. Don't feel like my business is appreciated You better improve on your customer service immediately! You need more staff working the takeout counter."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, excellent food selection and great prices!! My friends and I go every thursday and have done so for tearz. Cant wait to go again, thanks for everything!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pickle Barrel plenty of times. Each visit was very disappointing.   Pickle Barrel has terrible service; the staff looks like they really don't want to be there at all. The reasonable priced food that tastes good is served with dirty cutlery that has food on them. You can't enjoy anything! When you bring the problem to the attention of the servers, they don't seem to comprehend the problem, or completely ignore the matter. Many times I was given a new set of cutlery to use, which also had food on it.   I really tried to like this place, hoping that perhaps it would clean up its act because the food is good. It's too bad the service and the cleanliness suck."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the worst experiences I've had. We walked in on a Tuesday night we waited to be seated for about 10 minutes until we finally asked someone they told us to just sit wherever we picked a table right next to the bar so we get noticed we got stared at by a few servers after another 15 minutes and asking servers that were punching in orders for some service no one came so we left. We came back the next day during lunch hours we waited with about six other people again everyone working there avoided three different couples that waited to be seated we left after about another 20 minutes of waiting. Avoid this location we had better service at a McDonald's that had a 2 star review."}
{"text":"I've heard some people talk about Pickle Barrel being lackluster overall,  however,  that is NOT the case with this location.   Every time I've been here I've always loved the food, and I've never had issues waiting too long for service,  or poor customer service.   The wait staff is always friendly,  and they'll always check up on you often even if the place is busy.   Now for the food,  one of my favourite dishes there is the Blue Burger( all the ingredients just come together so perfectly,  I could eat it everyday) ,  and their chicken and waffles.  I also tend to get breakfast here,  and the eggs Benedict is amazing,  especially with the salmon.  Any chance I get,  I'll substitute my regular side for sweet potato fries and I'm never disappointed.   The glow bowl and Sante Fe bowl are also great, healthy choices.  i know i've said everything is amazing and delicious, but it's true! This location is always a guaranteed good choice whenever me and my girlfriend are looking for a great place to eat at"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and been disappointed each time. There is just nothing special about the food and it honestly isn't worth the price. So many better options in the neighborhood. One thing which I really didn't understand is how they choose to place you. I went when it was really empty once and yet they put me in one of the smallest boots possible."}
{"text":"Spent my weekend at The Pickle Barrel. I love how the restaurant is located underground. I also liked the spacious atmosphere with the bar and kitchen. The restrooms are clean too; it doesn't require you to open the doors with your hands since there is a sensor when you enter/exit.  There is a ton of options to choose from in the menu with drinks, appetizers, pasta, seafood, sandwiches, and more.   I tried the baja fish tacos and hoisin ginger chicken bites to start. The chicken bites were a little on the dry side, but other than that, it was good. For the main course, I ordered the maple nut salmon. The fish had a subtle sweet flavour from the maple syrup and it complimented well with the mixed greens on the side.   Overall, I enjoyed my visit at The Pickle Barrel since there is a lot of variety to choose from and the prices are reasonable, the servers were friendly and there is free Wi-Fi in the restaurant.   I would come back again in the future."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at OK prices.   The good: you can get a $10 burger in a sit-down restaurant. Huge menu. Decent atmosphere, friendly service.  The bad: Huge menu = jack of all trades, master of none. None of the dishes seem inspired. Everything seems competently made, but nothing really stands out. Inconsistent quality. Sometimes their fish is good, sometimes dry dry dry."}
{"text":"Definitely the bottom of my list for dinner.  1. Service The manager was talking loudly with the customers. I was sitting just the table next to them. My ears hurts. As I found the appetizer - Nachos is huge, the waiter wont let me cancel my main course. He told me that the main course is ready in a min. What? I just start the appetizer and the main will be then in the warmer?!!!!! He also has no apology that he charged me the appetizer when I gave the coupon to him by the beginning of the dinner.   2. Food I order Nachos and chopped steak. Nachos was ok and Chopped steak is a bit salty.  3. Decor  Outdated decoration.   I was expected to be as nice as the PB in downtown. However, it is completely disappointed."}
{"text":"AWFULL !!   I have been here 5 times to meet family who found the location convenient. Every time the tables and food was greasy and not in the greasy spoon good way.  Be prepared for a server that showers less than once a week!! Gross.  Last complaint, when a restaurant has a menu with 300 things on it, the odds of your choice being fantastic are low.  Avoid, avoid, avoid!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service sucks though. Asked for water like 3 times before we got it, and it was AFTER we got the bill. Also, they have these buttons to call your server but they don't work! And they won't warn you that they won't work so you sit there pushing buttons like a toddler playing with a toy telephone."}
{"text":"I visited this past weekend, the service was extremely slow. The server passed us numerous times without even asking if we needed anything. Took 40 minutes until she came. I ordered the steak frites. She gave me my Cesar salad to start and when I was about to put my fork in my salad there was a huge bug laying there. I had to flag the waitress to let her know she didn't seem shocked she didn't apologize she just took it and walked away. Came back with my Cesar salad without the crotons and I had to ask for them she brought it . I had ordered my steak medium well and it came burnt and dry. When it was time to pay she charged me for my meal and I told her I wouldnt be paying for it I would like to speak to the manager . The manager came all nonchalant and guaranteed they cut their lettuce fresh and they will take it off my bill. I do not recommend coming here, customer service is terrible and the food isn't great either ."}
{"text":"Worst Mojitos Ever!   Seriously, I never thought I would meet a Mojito I didn't like, but the thing that Pickle Barrel calls a Mojito is really not worthy of the name. It tastes like some sort of hard lemonade with a bit mint thrown in and the pink candy stuff they rim the glass with, is just nasty.  The salad was also bizarre and kind of gross. It consisted of a giant heap of dried rice noodles and some spring mix absolutely drowning in dressing.   The food used to be OK there, but whatever they are doing now, just is not working."}
{"text":"Food and dessert is good.   What I hate most about the restaurant is waiting for the staff. Sometimes I would have to wait 15 minutes because there is no one at the front counter to show us to our seats. Also, the waiters/waitresses never seem to give re-fills unless asked or they wait until the end of the meal to give you another drink.  Another time, they were training a girl and I told her my order. The guy that was training her came back JUST in case she got the order wrong, he asked for the order again. I got a sandwich and wanted a cesar salad instead of fries. I got both fries and salad. In the end I got charged for both on my bill, and obviously when I wanted to talk to a staff about the mistake, they were nowhere to be seen.   I only return for the food, not the staff & the staff is usually horrible at every pickle barrel."}
{"text":"Went there for bevvys, my bf and I sat at the bar. The bartender was cold, rude, and seemed as though he hated his life.  He messed up my ceasar order and then proceeded to blame me for the screw up. Won't be recommending that place to anyone or returning, unless they change their staff up and get people with better attitudes."}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss. I've has good meals and horrible ones, so it lacks consistency. The cleanliness of the tables and dinnerware isn't terrific so check to make sure things are properly cleaned. Bathroom is in the basement so it's not great for people with mobility issues. I would go here is at the mall and really wanted a restaurant where I can get a beer, but certainly wouldn't make the trip otherwise."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch - food is inoffensively standard and priced accordingly, with no complaints about their bottomless coffee; however it took over 30 minutes for my order to arrive, and the servers while pleasant seemed a little flustered likely not of their own fault."}
{"text":"We really loved the seafood paella. Tasted great, not too salty. Service was with a smile, and always checked in on us during the meal. Great ambience, very relaxing. It's easy to loose oneself and just stay and eat even more.   We have frequented this particular PB and it's probably our best in Toronto. Great for a night out and after wearing yourself out shopping at the Yorkdale mall."}
{"text":"I went here twice ever.  Once for my 16th birthday, i had their spaghetti with their massive meatball. I remember not being a fan of it.    The more recent time i went, we waited 20 mins for a table, not bad for a friday night. Hostess seem kinda slow and not attentive. They don't give out pagers either?  Anyways finally got a table. Im not use to going to a restaurant where there's no hankie, but napkins.  Ordered their famous 35 oz milkshake, vanilla. It was amazing! I'd come back for that.  Also ordered their martini, can't remember which one , but really just tasted like orange juice and vodka.  For entrees, my boyfriend and i got the lobster and shrimp angel hair pasta.  Please tell me, why was the lobster imitation crab meat? And why was there bean sprouts in my pasta?  I sent it back because their alfredo sauce tasted like butter and cheese.  I got the smoke atlantic salmon penne. Much better, but again i found a bean sprout?!  All in all, it was decently priced for the portion size, milkshake was good. If anything i'd come back just for the milkshake and maybe salmon penne.  Still very upset they put lobster, BUT IT WAS IMITATION CRAB MEAT!    But our server was nice!   decor 3/5 average food 2.5/5 service 4/5  overall 2/5"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that we used to love Pickle Barrel! It was a place of comfort food for us. But... Last time we ate at this (Centerpoint) location the place was at around 50% capacity yet the food took close to an hour to come out, it arrived cold and not fresh, and not all dishes came out. We ordered pretty basic dishes mostly, yet they managed to screw it all up. The hamburger arrived hardly warm, with cold and greasy fries. We asked to change the fries and got the new plate after we finished all our meal. It was still soft and greasy, but at least it was hot. (Had a feeling like they microwaved old fries, actually). The salad that was supposed to have crispy noodles and nuts came with soggy noodles and hardly any nuts. The kids' Fajita came with cheese that looked like plastic - all oily on the outside, and hard. Looked like it was standing outside on a warm day. We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes with that, but it never came. The kids' penne came with no sauce on it, and it also looked like it has been standing under the warmer for a good period of time. When we asked for more sauce they charged us $1 extra. Overall this experience was very bad, and we will not go there again! This was the second time we eat at this location and have complaints."}
{"text":"I was actually being generous by giving them a star. I'm surprised health Canada hasn't issued a warrant or violation. Here's why....  I was dining solo and just wanted a quick bite and a glass of vino. I decided; however to try their mini fish (back) tacos. Well I waited approximately 9 minutes to be served. The few servers that I saw were running around like a chicken with their necks cut off. As a matter of fact the bussboy/server was walking by my table and I guess from my facial expression he stopped in his tracks and asked me if I've been served. I thought that was a strange question to ask if he didn't see any cutlery nor water in front of me. I ordered mini fish tacos, side order of fries, water w/ lemon and a glass of Pinot. The hostess brought my water without lemon, I reminded her about the lemons. She blatantly and unapologetically said \"we're out of lemons\" and walked away...not impressed by the lack of professionalism.  The tacos came in a super tiny saucer same size as the taco which made it extremely awkward to hold considering that it's filled with coleslaw and the fish. As I held the taco it was spilling over onto the table which made an unsightly mess. The tacos were soggy which therefore looked unappealing. French fries came shortly after without ketchup...I requested for a larger plate so that I could actually eat and handle the tacos without losing most of the contents. The plate, well a huge platter didn't come until about 6 minutes later by I assumed was the manger. I told her that the service was inefficient, unpleasant and and the food was unappealing. She was apologetic and offered to show me the menu again. I told her that I was fine and that I just wanted fries. Fries came out with new cutlery. The knife was encrusted with dried mayonnaise or something. Check please!! I'm done! Pickle Barrel is an ironic Canadian franchise dating back to 1971 but if they continue with such lacklustre and inefficient service, terrible food and dirty cutlery; I am confident that they will not be around much longer."}
{"text":"One of our family favorites. Never had a bad meal, huge menu with lots of options, some of which are even healthier. The chicken fingers are excellent and real. The French toast is amazing. Honestly the low scores make no sense to me here."}
{"text":"I've been to many Pickle Barrels before and I always enjoy it. I've been to this Pickle Barrel a few times before and I've never had any complains. I've gotten the Cesar salad with steak a few times from the Promenade Mall location and it's always been very good. I decided to get it at this location and they brought me a large salad with a big steak on top that was inedible. I should have known from the fact that instead of \"steak\" it said \"beef\" on the menu but I didn't know it could be this bad. It was just a really bad cut of beef and it was huge! At the Promenade location they used to give a few pieces of good quality steak, which for $4.99 I would much rather have instead of a huge piece of bad beef. I sent it back and it was taken off my bill, so no harm done. The waitress was alright she took quite a while to refill our drinks after we finished them even though she walked by our table a few times. We also ordered the fried calamari and in the picture on the menu it showed it being small, thinly sliced, very crispy rings but they were the huge thick cut ones which aren't as good. It's just disappointing when they put a picture of one thing but you get something entirely different. My boyfriend got the cheeseburger and there was a nasty piece of brown lettuce that seemed like it was rotten, so he didn't touch his burger after that. All in all, it was not terrible but it wasn't good either. Very disappointing because I love Pickle Barrel, but I'll never be back to this one."}
{"text":"It seems that the renovation really helped this place. The decor is really nice and the restaurant seems very clean. I've seen multiple managers on the floor and checking that everything is running smoothly. The server seemed a little overwhelmed for a moment when I was first seated and it took a little while for her to get to me, but past that slight hiccups things were smooth. I'm actually not a fan of Pickle Barrel but the food was quite good this time. The Mac n Cheese Poppers were amazing! And $6 for a pint of Stella isn't too bad either. Overall it was a good experience and I'd definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. After waiting almost 40 minutes for my lunch, I found a strand of hair in my sandwich. The waitress and waiter were so unfriendly and hostile that it made me and my family feel uncomfortable. The food was not good and I will never be going there again. Although we tipped the waitress 20% she did not even give us one smile."}
{"text":"Recently went here for lunch with the girls.   The service: We ordered our drinks and apps within minutes of being seated. Unfortunately, the service was super slow. We didn't get our drinks for about 15 mins and when we asked about our apps, they arrived about 10 mins later. Before we were even through our apps, the mains were delivered. So the main waited and got cold while we finished our apps. We had to ask the waitress to remove the empty appetizer dishes as there was barely any room on the table. Shouldn't they do this on their own?!  The food: Our table ordered the calamari and sweet potato fries to share. I can't really say anything about the calamari since I didn't have any. But the sweet potato fries were great. The sauce that came with it was so-so. I ordered the fettucini pomodoro which was delicious. It was also great the next day for left overs :)  Overall, it's an ok place to eat. Don't run here to give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"I had the lava cake with ice cream today. The service was friendly and quick, but the dessert itself was very unimpressive - I've had this before at a Toronto location, and it was very good (my only complaint was that the lava cake is on top of the ice cream, which makes it a bit awkward to eat). Over here though, the \"lava\" cake didn't really have the oozing lava fudge like it's supposed to... instead, it was basically a slightly warmed brownie with chocolate sauce.  Not bad for that, but then it certainly shouldn't be called a lava cake."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for breakfast,lunch & dinner during the week and on weekends and the service has NEVER been prompt! My daughter and I sat at the bar, the bartender saw us and although not busy, left us sitting for 10 minutes before even taking our order.  Save your money or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good and the staff are friendly most of the time (but sometimes it seems like they hate their job) but like everyone else has experienced the service is always slow!! I don't know if they are just understaffed but its pretty bad. I rethink of going back because its never quick and they never acknowledge how late the food is.... which is bad if that is 'normal' for them."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Saturday night - expecting it to be busy as hell, after all, is IS in Yorkdale. But it only took a minute to get a table for 6 -- score!  This location has gone through a lot of renovations and it shows - the place looks great.   Service was awesome - our female server was both friendly and quick and didn't forget or mess up an order. Definitely deserving of a huge tip, which is so much easier to say as someone else paid the bill that night :P  Much of their menu has changed - it is smaller than it used to be, but still quite a good amount of options. I ordered the chicken and waffles, as I'm as southern as you're going to get for an Italian boy, and I loved it. I felt like Oprah on one of her fat days (which is like everyday nowadays), but it was definitely worth it. I'd probably order this again.  The waffles were sweet and the chicken moist and delicious!  Some of the other meals ordered included deep fried pickles (at the pickle barrel? shocking), burgers which were pretty damn good as well ( I stole a bite), fish and chips and a salad. All healthy portion (and by that I mean, huge and unhealthy) and all looked great. Though some of my friends complained about the fish being a bit soggy, I can't really comment since they were sitting too far away from me to sneak a bite. And I wouldn't touch salad unless it was made with grease so I assume that was also good.   Bottom line - great place to eat. I enjoyed it and the prices were pretty decent for the portion size. PS - Get the milkshake. That thing is huge! And no, that's not what she said. I said it."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be really good a few years ago, when they renovated the place and came out with a new menu. Unfortunately, management changed, and that showed clearly in the food and poor service. I had experiences when management rolled their eyes at me and exclaimed sarcastically 'really?!' when I asked to pay for a $50 meal with my credit card instead of cash, when items that are advertised as part of a combo actually aren't included. It's also really difficult to flag down a waiter because there's usually only one waiter who is usually in the back doing something. Taste-wise, I could cook something much better at home. I used to come here once or twice a month, but will never visit again."}
{"text":"We come here often and get the best servers but this time we had to walk out. We waited for this lady to take our damn order, who's been trying to ignore us like 8 times or more. No eye contact no nothing at all. She's being hesitant, trying to look away when she's almost at our table then all smiles with the other customers. Ive also tried calling her but maybe she didnt hear me(?) She's passing by us like were ghost or something, i mean we dressed properly to get noticed lol. So whats the best thing to do? Walk out! And write a negative review. She took someone else's order who came 10 mins after us. She served them drinks and took their order. Meanwhile we were there starving, on the side, ready to chew on the napkins. We wouldnt have mind waiting but the place wasnt even busy. Which is plain bs. I know what their doing because i work at a restaurant too. But im nicer than this particular server lol. Oh btw, she looks about 5\"2, curly hair and has dark circles around her eye. She serves the tables nearby the bar. I couldnt get her name so you know who to write-up hahaha.  Maybe if we sat somewhere else, a nicer server wouldve been able to service us.   But 5 stars to the guy greeting customers!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Food was sub sub par. I had the bbq chicken that were as hard as hockey pucks and just slightly tasted better. I swear that it was left over from the lunch menu and kept warm till it dried out from the heat lamps either from lunch time or the previous day. I will never eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Pickel Barrel is one of those places I always like to go with groups because the menu is so diverse. There is always something for everyone.  With that said, the food is just ok. It's not really bad, but it's not anything really great either.  I went to this location last night for dinner with family. I go to this location a lot and the food is usually fine.  Yesterday I ordered this blue cheese bacon hamburger. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Bacon was crispy and the blue cheese tasted great.  The service was not bad this time.  However, this location and Pickel Barrel in general, from my experience, has always been inconsistent with their service.  The service is always hit or miss. Yesterday was a hit, but it may have easily been a miss.  Sometimes the service is really slow. It sometimes takes so long just for someone to come and take our order, refill our drinks, bring our food, or even bring us the bill.  Again, not sure what they do to train their servers across all their locations, but Pickle Barrel seems to be notorious for inconsistent service.  Yet, the food is ok and the diverse selection will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Still waiting for my food. 32 minutes in.  We are here with two kids and they're absolutely starving. I didn't think pasta took this long to prepare."}
{"text":"Menu says something about the best sandwich recipes of all times, but what you really get there is some generic tasting ham on stale bread. Other food was disappointing as well."}
{"text":"Came in with my family around 10:50pm to get apps and drinks after watching a movie. Waited 5-10 minutes to find a server to assist us and take our orders. He was friendly but under the circumstances this restaurant has it really made no difference.   The restaurant had a good amount of people in it, but nothing overly busy. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time, waited 20 minutes to get anything. During this time we watched both bartenders have a drink for themselves, eat, and go back and forth to get themselves MORE food to eat. I've worked both in the serving industry and the fast food industry and that is unacceptable.   My family and I come here extremely often and have visited PB MANY times since it first opened at the mall. There have been other issues with this restaurant but we have continued to give it chances time after time. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the worse Pickel Barrel Ever! I was really hungry I thought I could have a good meal but I have to wait for your Food 30 minutes I ordered ribs and wings the server gave me sweet potato instead of fries. She told me \"YOU said your want sweet potato \" I said I'm sorry but I don't eat sweet potato so why I should order it? so she gave me fries after 5 minutes. Seems like It's my fault When She literally got the wrong order...She also didn't apologize to me!!! The fries was saggy and uncooked, I didn't even bother to complain.. I just want to get my bill and leave..."}
{"text":"I have been going to pickle barrel for decades.  I enjoy the food for the most part.  My big issue is with the ladies washroom.  They are very far from the dining area and require you to walk down a very long staircase.  They are in a very isolated area.  If there were to be any kind of a problem, your screams for help could not be heard.  The bathrooms are a disgrace as they are filthy!  The locks on the stalls don't align properly, so you can not lock  them!  The stalls have the newer large toilet tissue dispensers, which means you can't manuever into the stall without your leg or pants brushing up against the toilet bowl."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with 2 friends today.  I ordered the chicken and beet salad because I LOVE beets.  This salad however was horrible.  The chicken was dry and tasteless, the beets were barely edible and even the greens were brown and limp.  The dressing was good.  To make matters worse the cost was $16.00 (which is what Milestones and Joey's charge for Good salad).  The ambiance was ok inside a vey tired mall.  The service was friendly but inattentive.  I won't go back as the food is just too awful at any price."}
{"text":"A LONG OVERDUE REVIEW...    The Service:   Arrived at this location recently on a busy evening about an hour until the mall closed. I saw that there were people waiting, so asked the hostess how long the wait time would be specifically for a booth in the bar area. Was informed that it would only be about 15-20 minutes.  I decided to spend some time shopping around and wait for my friend to arrive before putting my name down as I was in no hurry at that point (about 8pm). We went back a little more than a half hour later and find that the wait times have not changed. Gave my name, got a buzzer - we should be seated by 9.  It's a quarter past 9, and still nothing. I go back to ask and am told by the manager that we are next on the list and will be seated shortly. I'm starting to get hungry! She apologizes for the wait and thanks us for our patience as she walks us over to the dining area. Hang on, I specifically asked for a booth in the bar area twice (we want to watch the highlights and some privacy).  So she says sorry, and walks us to the bar side, hoping to find us a booth. She eyes one open towards the back, but as we approach, it's given away by the same hostess that I spoke to twice (she said no problem, absolutely!).  The manager (luckily) apologizes once more and says that she can seat us at a table and move us to a booth as soon as one is available. At this point, I can clearly see that all of this could have been avoided by better communication between staff (particularly that one hostess who seemed to be in her own world that whole night). But it's 9:35 and I'm definitely hungry hungry! She can see our frustration as we contemplate going elsewhere, then gives us a very genuine apology, just as before, along with an offer to cover our whole meal, anything we'd like. Whaaat? Appetizers, dinner, desserts, drinks (nonalcoholic), you can get whatever you want, she says. \"I'll make sure it's all taken care of, because we really do apologize but would like to reward your patience and for you to continue returning.\"  Okie doke then.  Although there was still a long wait to be served, and I did get a bit hangry, it was totally worth it. Spent our extra cash on beers, it was awesome!    The Food:   - Buffalo chicken wings with honey garlic sauce: big juicy and crispy wings, finger-licking sauce. Got eight big ones served with carrots, celery and dip. - Sweet potato fries: plentiful and super crispy! Tasted so good with the flavoured mayo dip.  - Maple glazed salmon: which was cooked so nicely with nuts and veggies. Very delicious, moist, sweet and beautiful presentation.  - Peppercorn New York strip loin: cooked medium rare, with steamed veggies, mashed potatoes, peppercorn gravy and starter salad (caesar). Steak was very tender, cooked just perfectly and tasted good enough to be my last meal. They forgot to give mashed potatoes, so they gave an extra when I asked. Gravy was the only thing that didn't taste too special. Veggies are plain, however I personally enjoy them simple. And my friend did not like the extra butter in the potatoes.  Is there room for dessert? Almost always yes (especially if it's on the house). - asked for the mini dessert sampler, picked out a key lime pie, peanut butter and I really wanted the tiramisu but it wasn't there. The server came back a few minutes later with two! They all tasted alright to me, seemed like too much flavour in one little glass. But I'd definitely get the tiramisu again and maybe try the triple mousse one.  Drinks - water, iced tea and a few of their big mugs of Keith's pale ale ($7 each).    Overall:    Great menu options, everything from standard pub fare to amazing lo-cal/gluten free items and wonderful all day breakfast. Works with every budget, you can get a great meal starting at around $10 to $30. Or even just get a few apps, lots to choose from.  I keep coming back for the service though! Even when it is lacking a bit (usually just wait times), they have always always made it up! Yes, their staff could be better, but no place is perfect 100% of the time. And like I've tried to emphasize, if you aren't satisfied with anything pertaining to the food or service, management always will offer you a free meal. Or if you thought you'd get more sweet potato fries with your burger (because you were hoping to share, like me), here's another basket with twice the amount on your plate already. Or if you thought the steak was just a bit overdone, it's on the house. And we'll make you another one if you want too.  I'm not saying that you should always find things to complain about. They do try hard to meet your expectations though, whatever they may be, and I enjoy giving them my continued business because there's great food for every mood and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"These reviews are pretty bang on. Mediocre burger. Small portion of fries . Gravy does taste like beans. Took a bit for our bill too. We sat at a empty table for a bit   Response to nancy.  Hi Nancy ! Thank you for your response I haven't received a private message yet but I wanted to say we have been to other locations and always had a great experience. We haven't been in a long time but I think it was just this location that we had a okay experience. Wasn't horrible though .we will still continue to eat here"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, interesting layout, many different levels...kept it interesting.  Had the Texas Steak Sandwich  medium rare.  Steak was cooked perfect , very tasty!  I only ate half it was so big!  12 bucks for the steak sandwich, much nicer than eating at the food court in the mall!"}
{"text":"I give up. I tried many times to like this location after having wonderful meals at other Pickle Barrels but this one is just horrible. We were seated promptly in the middle of a few dirty tables with a couple flies hovering over the half-eaten food. We waited quite a while for our smelly, disheveled waiter to finally appear. He leaned down to see what I was asking about on the menu and his breath liked to knocked me out. He took our drink order but never came back!  15 minutes later, we asked another server to please ask our server to come over but he couldn't find him either. After 30 minutes of not even getting our drinks, we gave up and left."}
{"text":"First and last visit. We ordered a kids chicken strips and two fish & chips. Order took forever to come with kids meal (what little chicken there was was overcooked) coming a full 6-7 minutes before ours, which arrived undercooked and oily. We ate the fries and left the fish. The server was pleasant and apologized on the meals without our saying a word. Never again. I would no star this place if I could."}
{"text":"WARNING! DON'T ORDER THE LETTUCE WRAPS!! After already eating half of our lettuce wraps, something black caught my eye on my lettuce leaf. I looked closer and realized it was DIRT! I went on to inspect the rest of my lettuce and found DIRT on every piece, but that wasn't the worst of it... I also discovered A DEAD INSECT on my lettuce leaves! My girlfriend's lettuce was just as dirty. I shudder to think what I already ingested unknowingly. We were horrified and requested to speak with the manager. She showed up, apologized, offered us some water, told us we wouldn't have to pay (duh!) and said she'd be speaking to the kitchen manager. I'll be speaking to Peel Public Health. I have pictures! Absolutely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"One time the nachos were good and the other time they were okay, so basically a hit or a miss. I've also had their Fettuccine Pomodoro with Chicken, Homestyle chicken fingers and Poutine. All were good! The service is always slow here but a good restaurant to dine in after shopping."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pickle Barrel more times that I'd like to. The reason for this is that it is conveniently located inside the mall so its easy to come here once you are done your shopping and are in need of refuelling.   Some of the food here can be downright repulsive. I had the chicken fajitas once and they were so totally devoid of any flavour or seasoning (plus the chicken was dry to boot) that no matter how much hot sauce,salt, or sour cream I doused on them, they continued to be totally tasteless.   Some of the items can be passable, but I find that for the most part their food is just not good. Maybe its because they have about a billion and they just don't care about perfecting any single dish.   The last time I was here my mom and I shared some \"Spicy Mussels\" which were ok. Nothing outstanding, but at least the mussels weren't overcooked and rubbery. We also had the BBQ Chicken with sweet potato fries and it was fine. The chicken wasn't dry and though it wasn't particularly tasty, there really wasn't anything to complain about.   They also have a \"Healthy Options\" menu, with items such as steak and bok choy, salmon, some chicken with rice and some other things. I tried the \"burger\" (without bun) and it was pretty bad. Dry and tasteless. But I guess that if you are watching your weight, or just trying to eat healthier you will have some options besides a salad with no dressing.   I really wish I could say that I won't be returning here again, but I probably will the next time I find myself shopping at Yorkdale and am too hungry and lazy to go looking for food somewhere else. Its not like there's many other options in this mall anyway."}
{"text":"The Menu is huge, therefore you can expect the quality of the food to be bad. My plate came cold, ingredients are the cheapest they can find.Food tastes so bad, it has been a long time since I ate such tasteless food. (I got the 3 cheese gnocchi, fish and chips and the cabbage soup)  Honestly just go upstairs and eat at the food court and you will do better than coming to pickle barrel."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast with the family We enjoined the pancake and Greek salad Very economical place for a lazy morning breakfast I think that the price comparing to what you get is a Great value"}
{"text":"After a few years of giving them second chances  I decided that this will definitely be the last time. My favourite Greek salad has shrunk quite a bit and came straight from the fridge. It was freezing cold.  It  was missing scallions which were always part of it, they also served it without the Pumpernickel roll it's supposed to include. The server offered us  a couple of slices of plain rye bread instead but the bread we got was not enough and stale and when we asked for more we were told that we will be charged for it. Our server looked tired, her shirt was dirty, she was not a happy camper.  I have no idea what happened to this chain but the staff are not properly trained and the quality of the food has totally tanked over then last few years. I am done."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday. The hostess was great, everything else was terrible. The order was wrong, and when we had to ask for missing items, the waiter rolled his eyes at us. The food was tasteless and bland and we left it half eaten and went for a bite in the food court. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here and the price I thought was very fair. Lots of choices on the menu for just about anyone no matter what you fancy. Not a local so had to try it and I was very pleased with the results great food at a good price! Look forward to going again next visit here!"}
{"text":"On the rare occasion, I go to Pickle Barrel, I don't expect much. On the other hand, I also expect the food to meet a minimum standard of edibility. Tonight, PB failed the test.   There is no need to go into detail about the entire meal. You probably know what you're going to get with PB. However, I do want to comment on the chicken fajitas. My girlfriend made her fajita before mine, took a bite and immediately asked me to smell the meat. My first reaction was that she was being a bit dramatic (on account of being Virginia) but alas, she was correct. The smell of that meat was the most disgusting thing I've smelled in a restaurant. Honestly, how does that get out of the kitchen? This wasn't just something that was not to our tastes. This stuff was vile.  We sent it back and proceeded with our meal but the memory lingers..."}
{"text":"On Saturday December ,10,2016 I visited the pickle barrel  for the first time my breakfast that I ordered was really horrible the eggs were cold and The toast was not toasted and the bacon was only one strip of bacon I will not be back and I will tell all my friends I am so upset about the first time. I evencontacted the pickle bill on the Internet and they said that if I could have the receipt the copy of the receipt I don't have the receipt my friend paid for it  but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Decent food. I find it all these chains restaurant have the same type food and no creativity what so ever. I tried their omelette here and it wasnt fresh at all and coffee was watered down. Beside service was slow too"}
{"text":"They were super busy and unfortunately the service was really slow.  They just opened, so they are probably still working things out a bit.  The salad I had was great."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with a few friends. The food was tasty especially the sweet potato fries. However the waitress we had was not very polite. I saw her rolling her eyes at us when we were ordering and when my friend had a question on the meal she was being condescending. When my friends told her it was my birthday, she said that they don't do anything for birthdays and walked away. Obviously i'm not expecting much, but typically at restaurants they sing happy birthday or give a free scoop of ice-cream. She just came, put down the milkshake (which was $10.99 plus tax) and left without even saying happy birthday. Am I over exaggerating? I assume she thought we were trying to get something for free, but maybe they really don't do anything. It still doesn't excuse the waitresses attitude."}
{"text":"I went to this location got the salmon and the South East Asian waitress was rude and racist.... that's why I asked another white waitress if we could change tables and she said yes and served kindly.... I don't know what the lady's name was but the Filipino or Vietnamese server was extremely impolite and I would want to tell their manager to terminate her employment"}
{"text":"Overall I really like the Pickle Barrel chains, but this one stands out as terrible.  We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was full of empty tables because, \"we don't have enough servers to serve you.\" Once seated it was another 10 minutes before a waitress came by and took our order.   The CHOCOLATE milk shakes was a light khaki colour for the lack of chocolate, and came in a mug with a broken handle that almost cut my hand open. My dessert spoon had mysterious crud stuck to it.  And, on top of all this, the waitress short changed me when I paid in cash!!  Unless you enjoy having to wait, being ignored, and then served substandard food and overcharges, STAY AWAY from this location of the Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"Where to even start...in spite of the string of 1-star reviews here, this place is still packed (mostly with senior citizens who probably don't read Yelp).   The service was friendly, slow, and forgetful. We even had to ask for cutlery, napkins (twice) and to reconfirm our order. I think our order even forget to add the fruit as stated on the menu.  The prices weren't that cheap (like $5 for a simple matzo ball soup).  It's difficult to stay mad at the servers because they seem to be cheerfully trying to work with what they're dealt with. The guests are forgiving because even with all the mess, they'll probably be back again next Sunday.  I had the three eggs breakfast. The challah bread was just ordinary sliced bread, the coffee tasted like cigarettes, the potato latkes were shaped like dry potato balls (not pancake style), the water had a filmy oil with crumbs floating it in, and the eggs were pooling in oil. I still ate it because it's exactly the Sunday morning breakfast that you have when you've been out late and will eat anything the next day.   Oh, the clincher was finding an elastic band in our order of bacon and eggs!"}
{"text":"Ymmv !! WTF??  30 days later and they....  So i waited 3 minutes before hostess came to get me and sit me and she put me in a sh8t table bad location, for was dirty table was dirty...(i just finished with davids and had meth or shabu or some kind of high tea)  None of these trivial things bothered me today..  Server was there with water and to take my order(wtf a first) right away. I told her i didnt want the latkes and she offered a salad(wtf another first)  Anyways, great service at davids, great service here .. I was in good mood..  Steak was great... Maybe it was laced with contraband?"}
{"text":"Last week thursday 2/12/15 breakfast  They've \"modernized(?)\" updated the decor +1 I got the filipino waitress(thank god) the 2 white servers were busy talking and playing with phones  Service +1 got lucky, good waitress. Was taken care of, numerous check ups, refills. Fast, friendly, polite, pointed out specials.. Food, +1 it was breakfast, but good above expectations(see promenade review) Price +1 fair but cheaper than vaughan mills  I would recommend and repeat, if i could get same service and food"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great variety, yummy!  Rose Reisman's bowls are deeelish'!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with other yelpers that this place is pretty mediocre.   The food and service is not the best but it's also not so horrible I wouldn't return.   I do like their soup and sandwich lunch combo (but only when it's mushroom soup day). Their pastries (ie. muffins & biscottis) are very bland and stale - they should price those items relative to the quality in my opinion.  Otherwise, this place is conveniently located for a quick bite during work hours. There are better alternatives in the area that I would recommend over Pickle Barrel though."}
{"text":"Poor, slow service. Extra salty ceasar salad. Bug in cocktail. Just bad. It seems they never check on you. Many, many mistakes. Slow table turnaround while guests wait to be seated."}
{"text":"the first two times I went here, it was pretty good - food and service. but recently I went and it was not up to par. I went on a weekday around 2pm for lunch with a friend, we were seated in a booth where I could see the waiter just waiting along the side - which made me quite uncomfortable as you can imagine. the food was decent, and we paid, but a week or two later when I was checking my bank statement, it had said I had been charged an extra $5 dollars for my meal, I checked my receipts and it did not add up. I'm not sure if the waiter added some tip after I had already added one, or if it had gotten mixed up with my friends, but it was very frustrating l. I called to get it figured out, I was put on hold and then hung up on. I had to then call AGAIN to speak with someone - and he basically said that my order wasn't in their system anymore and that I would have to go into the restaurant to get it sorted out properly. this is obviously frustrating especially for someone who isn't super close to Yorkdale, but I made the drive - if they were a superb company they would have refunded my whole order, but I was given the difference that I was mischarged for. will most likely not be returning."}
{"text":"I used to love the Pickle Barrel, but my tastes have either drastically changed or it's gone way, way downhill. Even still, I used to frequent this location for a few months in the summer of 2012 - the only reason was really because they were in my neighbourhood, and had a new (and delicious) Rose Reisman designed gluten-free menu (including rice pastas and GF bread!). Sadly, that menu was scrapped a few months ago, and the servers tried to tell me it was \"years\" old (and weren't really helpful in knowing whether other items contained gluten or not).   I do like their giant bellini's, the view of the street from certain booths/tables, and the mini desserts (though most are not gluten-free)."}
{"text":"Usually this is my go to place, but today I wasn't impressed.  I ordered the Glow Bowl, but I found it too sweet for a quinoa salad.  Next time I'll go for the Santa Fe.  I'll still come back though, too many options to stay away!"}
{"text":"Chicken n waffles was ok; lacked flavour but was crispy. Great portion size however a bit disappointing where flavours are concerned. Would also be nicer with a chipotle sauce perhaps."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the new location opening in Pickering. Made the mistake of ordering take out. Ordered 2, Montreal Smoke Meat, fatty, marble rye, mustard on the side. What we received was 2 Montreal smoke meat, lean, stale regular rye, no mustard. Came with super cold fries, coleslaw and a mouldy pickle. $12.99 each.  This location is a fail:("}
{"text":"Similar to most pickle barrel around, lighting was average and it was fairly busy upon arrival. First time getting steak here and it wasn't bad. However, I wouldn't recommend it when you take into account of the price and quality provided it was only mediocre. In totally it was $25+tax which came with 2 scoops of potatoes, mixed veggies and onion rings. Our waiter was very nice, even though they occasionally missed or mixed up orders they would eager fix everything as soon as possible.   Ordered the matcha green tea with orange juice which was around $5 but they gave us the kale spinach one instead. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend either of the smoothie, it's like they randomly mixed flavours together that doesn't compliment well with each other. It was very unique and simply did not taste very pleasant.  The plating was well done, we ordered the butter chicken as well. I would recommend that spinach paella however which was the only thing decent from our entire party."}
{"text":"Great location, nice atmosphere. I love how private and cozy the booths are! A couple of friends and I came here for drinks and the vibe was nice. Drinks were reasonably priced and servers were delightful. Good for a bar run with friends. I can't comment much on the food since we just ordered an appetizer of deep-fried pickles (which were ok). I'm a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Seated quick. Served promptly. Huge menu of great items at very good prices. Delicious food... great drink selection.  We had Montreal smoked meat on rye & a lobster Brie grilled cheese. ... love this chain."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with a group of 4. Haven't been here in years, and they did a lot of new renovation! Love the new decor and spacious areas, especially the bar!  Food: Ordered their honey garlic wings, it came with carrot and celery sticks, and a ranch sauce. Typical bar food. Good portions, it was filling! They were well made, and generous with the honey garlic sauce. A tad bit overpriced.   Service: Our female server was unattentive and only came back for us once. It was mid-day afternoon (past lunch) and the place wasn't busy by any means in her section. At least she was courteous and not rude. Service gets a B-.  Overall: Wouldn't make a special trip to come here. If you're in the area and want decent bar food at a clean place, come here. Family-friendly, group-friendly."}
{"text":"Went there for a friends birthday and at the reception they asked all of us if we needed kids menus even though we're all 18. I ordered the pasta and chicken parm, I literally think they plated my pasta and put a whole bottle of water in it, I could hydrate all of South Africa with my one dish. We were in a booth and later my friends are having a stroke because there's a cockroach beside us and we all ran. Later the manager I believe gave us another table and gave us free desert and half off our main dish. I ordered the key lime pie and in the menu it said limes fresh from Florida BUT I DONT THINK SOOOOO. The pie was harder than the crust itself idk how they can do that but that's scary. 10 minutes later the fire alarm goes off for like 2 hours straight and no one cared tbh but it was annoying hearing \"please evacuate\" for like thirty minutes. Then when our bill came they forgot to half off my main dish and I was mad grrrr  Never come here"}
{"text":"Contrary to my review of 2011, the Early Bird Special now includes \"Barrel Fries\" or latkes, but the price is now 7.99. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient, and the coffee flowed freely."}
{"text":"Where do we begin. Waiting for 20 minutes before being hastily greeted by the bus boy at our table. Insufficient cutlery. Wrong order for our nachos. Charged us extra for something we never ordered. My sisters meal was never served. When it finally was, it came on a dirty plate caked with mustard and other dirt. It was disgusting. The servers were running around the place trying to get to every table. Overall one of the worst experiences I've had at a pickle barrel. Can't justify the increases in prices in their menu when the quality of service has gone downhill.   Won't be coming back to this location and I've been coming here for over 20 years.   Avoid the hassle, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"We were here for our sister's birthday a few months back and we arrived at around 6 pm. There were no line up at the door, when we arrived. Everything were ok at best until we were eating our entree, first of all, the servers didn't get our plate to the right person, so we have to play a round of roulette, then we noticed that the servers and hosts were cycling our table non stop, and as soon as we put down our fork, someone will rushed over and took the plates away, I don't even remember if I had finish my plate or not. The best part was the server asked couple of the guests if they need a take out container while they were still chewing their food. I thought there must be a long line up at the door, even so, this is not acceptable. Food were average, service were terrible, paid over $150 for 5 to feel being rushed. We left at 7:30 pm and no one were at the door. Sent a complaint to head office, never get any follow up. We will never go back to Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"The last time I was at the Yonge and Eglinton Pickle Barrel was this past spring. The experience was so horrendous that I've refused to go back there.   My husband and I ordered our food, he ordered the steak and when it arrived his plate had a dirty paper receipt inside the food. When we told the waiter and he brought a new meal, they got the order wrong. When the bill arrived there was no discount or anything on it, we had to ask for the manager to even get 15% off. The manager had a bad attitude too, acted like it isn't his problem and like he couldn't understand why we were upset.   While we were waiting for the manager to \"rectify\" the problem, we saw a waiter who brought back a salad to the kitchen to be redressed and another waitress was like \"oh its ok, make him another, I'll take this one\" and she took it to her table! I would expect it to be standard practice from both a customer service and hygienic point of view not to re-serve food to unsuspecting diners that was already rejected and sent back to the kitchen by someone else.  I used to really like the Yonge and Eglinton Pickle Barrel, but this experience was unacceptable by any standards. Will not go back there."}
{"text":"Service was slow (no one took our drink oder for ~10min once seated). Waitress appeared confused, didn't answer questions."}
{"text":"Where do I start? 1. My reservation made through OpenTable was not in their system. Why? Because \"we're not getting the reservations from OpenTable\". 2. We waited for over 1 hour for our order to arrive. 3. The food was cold and had to be reheated. Why? \"Our heating lamps are underpowered\". 4.  We did get 15% off the cost of the meal without even asking."}
{"text":"From 5 months ago:  \"Ordered pasta from here and the pasta was slightly uncooked.  It was a lobster and shrimp pasta but it looked like stir fry because they added carrot, spinach and onions.  The pasta sauce was watery too.  Ordered sandwiches and they were small in size.  Too pricey for the quantity and absolutely no quality.  This is the first and last time coming to this joint.\"  So I received a message from Pickle Barrel asking me to try again and so we did TODAY:  Calamari - too bland, zero taste or salt Jumbo Club Sandwich - bread was super dry Baked Potato Skins with Bacon & Cheese - they forgot to put the bacon in Cali Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich - missing  No cutlery or napkins were provided with out take out order either, as they are \"grab and go\" so it was my fault, according to them.  Seriously.... My very last time!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was here to meet a buddy of mine for dinner and I would say the restaurant is designed nicely and is quite big and gets very busy so time yourself well.   As you get in you have to go down and then you would be hosted and will be seated if you have to wait or else they take you in.   The staff are very friendly and the menu is quite big. I had fried chicken with waffles and my friend had tacos. The Fired chicken was done up nicely and was crunchy but lacked any taste inside but the waffles were nice and had a kick to it! Where as my friend was given all the ingredients of a taco and he had to make it up and there was enough stuffing to enjoy with the number of tacos provided.   The price point is average and is what you would expect from a big chain."}
{"text":"service here was absolutely dismal. Came here for breakfast and no one was there to seat us, and this while witnessing several servers just pass us.  When we finally got seated we waited for around 40 minutes for a sandwich and french toast. While waiting, 3 staff members where just chatting around the bar probably just to stick it to you. When our orders finally came, the fries were stale. Like Mcdonalds fries left on the table after a day. In other words, barely edible.  We asked for some butter and the server, without even glancing at us says \"be back in a minute\". She never returned.    The worst thing about this meal is that I still had to tip something. Uggh.. It's one of the worst places I've been to in recent memory. I will not return which is unfortunate because the menu was pretty good if they only stuck to the service and food standards they were supposed to adhere to."}
{"text":"I came to this location with a friend for brunch on a Friday.  The lighting was terrible.  It bothered my friends eyes.  My friend and I both found this location to be too dark.  The elevator was a tight squeeze for my friends wheelchair.  The service was excellent.  My friend had a waffle and I had an omelette.  My friend liked her waffle.  I was disappointed with mine.  I couldn't eat the salad because it looked bad.  I found the portion to be smaller than at the Leslie location.  I also found that the menu was more expensive than the Leslie location.  The menu at this location was different from other locations.  Not sure if I will come to this location again."}
{"text":"I have taken advantage of their early bird specials several times because they have meatloaf on the selected special menu which has always been my favourite here. Now they have raised the price twice in the past year or so on this special so  doubt I will be going anymore. I also got a $10 voucher when I purchased a $50 gift card which they refused to honour because it was an early bird special. Of course they never said anything about this when they sold me the gift card."}
{"text":"Mostly we went here to try it since it was new and we had a coupon for a free appetizer (you get one for subscribing to their emails).  They are very busy since they are new here in Pickering (mall outbuilding) and the parking lot was a mess.  It is very poorly laid out which led to cars blocking the way and making it difficult to navigate.  Once we got in, there was a crowd waiting for tables so we had a few minutes to wait, but only maybe 10 minutes so not that bad.  It was around 5pm but they were packed so the noise level was quite high, to the point you couldn't tell what song was playing just the thud of the beat.  It took a while to get out drinks (ice water) but not much long to get our app, the PD Nachos.  This is a $14 plate of nachos that is mostly chips with a fair bit of cheese on top and a sprinkling of tomato, green onion, and jalapenos with tiny side bowls of salsa and sour cream.  The ration of chips to toppings was way off with way too many plain chips left over after you had finished the toppings.    For my main I got the BBBLT sandwich which came with fries.  This was stupposed to be a triple bacon sandwich with peameal bacon, prosciutto, and applewood smoked bacon along with the lettuce and tomato.  While you got a decent amount of the lettuce and tomato, you got two small pieces of peameal bacon which covered the bottom of the bun, a tiny thin slice of fried prosciutto not even big enough to cover more than half the sandwich, and one strip of applewood smoked bacon.  One strip?  The main taste of the sandwich was ham because of the peameal with very little taste of bacon since even torn in half you can't cover much a sandwich with one slice.  This was a $15 sandwich but wasn't worth it. The fry portion was quite small but since we had the nachos I didn't mind.  The sandwich also came with a dill pickle slice and a whole sweet gherkin on top of the sandwich.  While it wasn't bad it wasn't good enough to tempt me back with the high prices and underwhelming food.  Especially with two very similar but better restaurants (Moxies and Jack Astors) on the same property."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I have ever been. We sit down, 20 minutes nobody came to serve us. Finally got a cup of hot water with someone's lipstick stain there. So horrible! And asked to see the manager, the lady didn't even say sorry, just changed a cup of hot water for us."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday here today.  The renovations are quite nice and we liked the wave mechanism to get in and out of the bathrooms.  Our server was prompt, cleared the table and checked in on us at appropriate times considering the restaurant was busy.  The portion sizes are big.  My husband enjoyed his spaghetti and meatballs.  The chicken chow mein was bland.  The kids seemed to enjoy their kid's meal.  I didn't feel that the prices of the kid's meal reflected the value.  A tad overpriced.  My biggest discomfort was I felt the restaurant was not clean. Our table and chairs could have been wiped down better.  There was food under the table.  The vinyl seats just felt gross, not clean.  One child noticed a stain on a chair and didn't want to sit on it.  Glancing around the restaurant in general you do realize that more attention should be made to proper handling of the food and the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.  I also found the bright green shirts the servers wearing to be tacky.  It just didn't seem to go with the up scale feeling the restaurant seemed to be aiming for.  Better management of this restaurant would certainly place it on the map.  Until then, we shall not return."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations for PB - never have. My family likes to go here for some reason and I don't object on account of being a good person. Also, although not great, it's not the worst restaurant out there......or is it????? Last night my boyfriend and I ordered the chicken fajitas. They came and I was preparing my first one and all of a sudden I smelled something weird. I stupidly ignored this warning, not thinking it could be coming from my food and took a bite. Big effing mistake. My taste buds were violated to a degree which still almost makes me gag when I recall the memory. It was disgusting. The chicken was bad - my boyfriend said it made him think of a really gross rubber but it made me think of infections.  This was a serious offense. Whoever is in charge over there needs to get it together. Disgusting."}
{"text":"came here for lunch but had breakfast lol!  was happy to get eggs Benny with lobster - it was ok.  the service was slow and she didn't come back to ask if we were ok or if we wanted anything else. even getting the bill was annoying and took too long, a lunch break is generally an hour."}
{"text":"In general, I'm a PB fan, but I visited this particular location for a post-movie alcoholic beverage, and was pleasantly surprised! Have you ever ordered a bellini from PB? If you haven't, I suggest it, just so you can experience this incredibly oversized drink for only $7.90 taxes included.  I ordered a raspberry bellini, that came with a blackberry on steroids and a strawberry. It was great, not too sweet, not overly boozy (maybe a downfall for some), and we had lovely service.   In the summer, I quite enjoy the Rose Reisman warm spinach salad w/ chicken. They also let you add strawberries for an extra few bucks. Well worth it, usually very fresh, filling and healthy.   I don't like reviewing chains, but the bellini was something to write home about!"}
{"text":"Definitely not as abismal as my fellow Yelpers claim it to be! Not the newest or swankiest PB I've ever been in, AND it still has the old menu, but I'd say it's a delightful dining burrow.   This place is never as busy as other PBs - we went for Sunday brunch, the dreaded dining hour, and were seated right away. We had lovely service, enjoyed the classics (waffle w/ strawberry and vanilla frozen yogurt) and some fun additions to a regular egg breaky - chala toast, potato latkes and fresh fruit. Coffee was unlimited and they had a decent tea selection. The prices are the same as other PBs, $8.99 - $10.99 for dishes.  Interesting facts:  Old decor - the only PB I've been in lately that hasn't received the modern facelift. It has that dated-diner feel - quaint, endearing, not sleek  Old menu - the original PB menu! I quite like this feature - has all the classics and some discontinued items not found at the posh PBs. This does mean however,  it's missing some Rose Reisman dishes and other new additions. Breakfast however, seems fairly comprable.  Don't be so hard on this underdog! Not the shiniest penny in the bank, but the food was just as yummy!"}
{"text":"Met some friends on Friday night for a late dinner.  They ordered the Spiked Chicken Tacos as an appetizer and highly recommended them.  They had already had their dinner.  Two of my friends ordered the Spicy Hanoi Chicken Stir-Fry, and it looked like they barely touched their food!  They didn't enjoy their dinners at all.  Another friend ordered the Haddock Edamame and although she said it was good, the server never brought the tartar sauce that she requested.    As for me, I ordered the Homestyle Chicken Fingers from their specialty menu.  I figured you couldn't go wrong with those.  The chicken fingers looked like they were cooked \"blackened-style\".  They had no taste.  They forgot the coleslaw that was supposed to come with it.  The fries were the tastiest thing on the plate!    The server gave us free mini-desserts as most of us didn't care for our meals.  I had the red velvet cake in a shot glass.  There was more icing than cake, but when I scooped down far enough to actually taste the cake, it was good.  I've gone to Pickle Barrel before for breakfast at other locations and it was very tasty.  I think I may try this place again...but only for breakfast to see if the food tastes better.  I wasn't really impressed by my dinner though.  The only reason why I gave this a 3 is because the server was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Went once, never again. Service was not friendly. Service was extremely slow. Once we got our food, about half had to be sent back because it was stone cold. We had to constantly look for our server, or ask other servers, to find her, so we could get drinks. She walked right past us about 5 times as we tried to get her attention... If felt like she was purposely ignoring us. After dinner, we got sticker shock. Entire experience, was not anywhere near what the charged us on the bill. Wish I could give zero stars"}
{"text":"First time at pickle barrel in ages. I will be coming back.   Pickle barrel is a sit casual type place. It boasts a huge seating area and a menu just as large.   It has everything for a party with varying tastes. They also offer a locally sourced menu.   I ordered the ontario lamb steak with squash and sweet potato mash. It was wonderful and the price was right.   If you have kids this is a good place as well. Their kids menu offers a selection of 12 mains. I haven't seen another resto with such a wide selection for the kiddies.   We came at peak time, 7pm Friday and still got seated promptly.  Servers and hostesses are polite and friendly. Very helpful as they pulled a booster for my boy in an instant."}
{"text":"I agree with the overall rating of 2/5. Something needs to be done about this Pickle Barrel, because it is disgusting. I don't like using that word when referring to restaurants, but honestly I even had doubts about how my food was handled.  The restaurant is chaotic and not clean, the washrooms smell of DEEP urine, and tables everywhere are left uncleared. I'm surprised there aren't mice or roaches running around.  The food overall was good- my friend and I thought of ordering smoothies in the beginning but the waitress told us their yogurt machine wasn't working.  I had the Mushroom Swiss Bliss with sweet potatoes. Good for lunch, but not filling enough for dinner. I would suggest to the restaurant to add more to the burger (tomatoes, pickles, etc).  My friend wanted the Maple Nut Salmon, but the waitress (again) came by and told us that they were out of salmon so she ordered the Sesame Panko-Crusted Basa Fillet. The dish looked good, but she said it was so spicy her throat was irritated even an hour later.  We ordered dessert shooters after; I got the triple chocolate mousse and my friend got the lime meringue. My dessert wasn't moussy at all, it was more gloopy which is the best way to describe it but my friend enjoyed hers.  I usually enjoy going to the Pickle Barrel, but I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"So many choices... too many choices. I like places that kind of specialize in a few foods.. this place served everything! It wasn't bad. Whatever my girlfriend had had way too many onions and her breath smelled bad for the rest of the night. I had some pasta which was pretty good. It's about as expensive as you'd expect for Toronto, nothing outrageous."}
{"text":"40 years in business and lost their way.  Pickle Barrel is a strange place, originally an up market deli, they have forgotten what deli food and portions are and try to pump out sort of nouveau-neo-healthy-cusine that also misses the mark. Latkas that look like hockey pucks, deli sandwiches that look anemic are all served out by a staff that wouldn't know deli if they walked into one and don't give a damn about the customer. I would suggest that Rose Reisman go to Thornhill, Montreal or New York and see what deli is and then try again."}
{"text":"Many orders did not come correctly, some dishes didn't even come with ingredients that are listed as a standard part of the dish! Not a special request, not a slightly different but similar sounding dish, just missing fundamental ingredients that were part of the dish to begin with, as listed on the menu. And none of it was very good to eat either. I will say the Berry Blast smoothie was pretty good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I just updated this as I realized as of today, Pickle Barrel doesn't even have someone responding to the reviews-they just use a  computer bot with a STOCK PHOTO w/ the same automated message!!!! Look at all the reviews, even from other locations-\"Nancy C\" uses the EXACT SAME MESSAGE every time you have a bad review, regardless of the content. Another review from the Yonge location commented that sometimes they don't even get the name right, they just copy and paste from other reviews! Holy effin careless and unprofessional. .  So to anyone else who is considering this place-save your money. There are soo many other places to choose from that better value, food, and service.  I went here two days in a row and the experiences were night and day. 1st time the hostess, server, and food were all wonderful. Today, however, was terrible.   I waited for nearly 10 minutes without a server coming to my table, so I asked someone to get the manager. She goes 'Well, actually, this is my section, but I haven't started yet',and acted like it was my problem and that I was inconveniencing her by being sat in her section. If she didn't start yet, just get someone to take care of me in the mean time.  So the manager (smaller Asian woman) comes over and puts her leg on the booth and leans back, in a really informal and unprofessional manner. I told her I was waiting for 10 min w/o service and she responds, \"Well, I'm here now, is there anything I can do?\" No apology, just a rushed tone of voice. I tell her that I'd like some service and that I'm ready to order, so I order drinks, appetizer, and main and she goes, \"ok\" and takes off. Again, no apology. So then my actual server comes around a few min later and goes, \"you know that wasn't my fault, right?\", implying that she didn't want me to tip her badly bc of the mix up, and again, didn't apologize (even if it's not her fault, it's the professional thing to do). Just sloppy, rough around the edges service from both the manager and server that makes me feel my money would be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been to a Pickle Barrel. I honestly thought it was going to be a good lunch experience but my experience truly was a pure disaster.   I am a huge fan of breakfast and ordered the P.B. Big Breakfast ($13.99) from their all day breakfast menu. It eventually came and it was very, very awful. First off, I ordered latke and it came in a potato muffin ball. The latke itself was dry and cold. It tasted awful by itself and seemed like it was cooked hours ago and left sitting there. Second, I requested over easy for the eggs. However, all three yokes were broken and overcooked. The eggs were definitely not up to restaurant standards, even I can make better eggs than the ones that they serve here. Sausage and bacon were burnt and cold. Again, my point of it was either everything was cooked hours ago and left sitting there waiting to be served. In general, everything on the dish was just either cold or lukewarm. Also, where are the fresh fruits? My dish did not come with any. I thought that this breakfast meal was really mediocre.   To make matters worse, the service was dreadful. The multigrain toast that I ordered with my meal didn't arrive with my dish so I asked the server where is the toast and wanted some ketchup as well. He said he will bring it out but 10 minutes later, I was sitting there waiting for my toast and ketchup. Once again, I had to ask the server a second time where is the toast and ketchup and he finally brought them both out on separate occasions. The restaurant was pretty empty at the time I visited and the server didn't seem like he was busy.  TL:DR: To anyone reading this: stay away from the all day breakfast menu.   Terrible breakfast dish + terrible service = one big disaster.  I will not come back here when I am at Yorkdale Mall."}
{"text":"If you like dirty, this is the place. Spoke to the manager and told him about the garbage on the floor, overflowing garbage, etc.  He asked me to show what I was referring to.  In fact he was standing in it at the entrance. Wrote to the head office, and they say they will pass on the comments, yada, yada, yada. Time to call City of Vaughan health."}
{"text":"Came in today. In the first few minutes me and my friend had a great experience, the hostess was super nice and accommodated us just so we could sit somewhere we wanted to (the booth) she was awesome!   After that, it was all downhill. The waitress we had was HORRIBLE and barely even greeted or spoke to us. Getting water took forever and after eating we waited another 20 mins just for the waitress to come, never checked up on us once. The food was good at least but service made experience bad. We wanted to get dessert but didn't want to have to wait as long as we did so we left. Won't be recommending."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but definitely not good.  Saturday at about 5pm; my wife and I had to wait 5 minutes just for a host to show up to the podium. Another 2 minutes and we were seated. The place wasn't packed but was busy. Service was very slow, but polite. I wouldn't say friendly, not not rude either. No sense of urgency to bring food or drinks. The food arrived after about 35 minutes and it was cold and some of the items were missing, including condiments, which the server eventually brought but there wasn't so much as an apology for the inconvenience.  This location is very hit or miss and today was a big miss.  They need to re-evaluate who they have working here. No a single employee offered a smile or \"hello\".  It will be a while before I return for sure."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at 10am on Sunday. Food is ok.. The restaurant interior is very nice but service is highly lacking. Just the two of us... And we were made to feel like we were an inconvenience. Our server did not speak much... And this is at 10am."}
{"text":"terrible!!! food is terrible, bland, cheap in quality, & quality dropping constantly.  service: geez. bunch of slobs with no customer service training  we complained that 3 orders of chicken skewers were not the same as the skewers always ordered before, with onions & mushrooms, & they had no seasoning, were very dry & borderline burned.  manager keeps smirking, dismissing me as this is how they always make them, he's worked here a whole year! Meanwhile my husbands family has been ordering there for 20 years. also, he was making comments that I'm not listening, meanwhile he's trying to dismiss everything I'm saying about my group being disappointed with the food, but he kept talking OVER me & talking in circles, I had to explain to him that I heard him every time he kept repeating himself.  also, has to be said, excuse me, fat bitch at the front kept smirking & making smart-alec comments, & when I tried talking to her, she simply avoided looking at me, & kept grumbling under her breath.  WHERE IS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS??? PEOPLE LIKE THIS SHOULD BE FIRED ASAP!!! might I point out, customer service is a necessity.   I wasn't disappointed, I think their food was terrible in general, deserts, everything. maybe some people will like it? but some people like bland garbage, & are happy with it.  but do yourselves a favour, go someplace better, better food out there, much better service out there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. No hostess at the front desk and didn't see a sign so went in and seated myself. The hostess came by and noticed me and asked if I had been seated by one of the waitresses, to which I replied no and indicated that I had seated myself as no one was at the desk and I didn't see a \"please wait to be seated\" sign. I was asked to come to the front desk and was then seated at another table. Seemed like a bit of a power trip to me!  Later noticed another couple who just came in were seated where I just was. LOL.  Ordered a corned beef sandwich on marble rye with a side Caesar.  The sandwich was just ok, nothing special. The side Caesar was pretty lame, haven't seen powdered Parmesan on a salad since Ponderosa Steakhouse in the 70's. So likely wouldn't return as there are many smaller deli's out there that do a much better job of it."}
{"text":"* Only used delivery service on Uber Eats  I was skeptical because I had not been here for YEARS. Recently looked at their menu again and a lot was added. There's a tone of options on the menu for everyone.  What was ordered: - Chicken Parmesan - Triple Fruit Smoothie (Pineapple, banana & orange) - Strawberry Banana Smoothie - Strawberry, banana, pineapple smoothie - The Cracked Manhattan Steak - Turkey Burger - Crispy Calmari  All in all everything was pretty good, including portion size. Calamari is really delicious. I'm sick of them now because I overdid it. Wouldn't get the turkey burger again it kind of made me want to gag. All smoothies were great except for the triple fruit smoothie..not bad at all just didn't enjoy it that much. Steak was pretty on point too."}
{"text":"My family of 6 went here for lunch last Saturday. Got seated promptly, but never had a waiter come by. Finally stopped someone and had to ask for them to find our waiter. We ordered promptly and waited, waited, and waited. Finally got our drinks and then our meals. All meals were cold, three were not correct, no refills on coffee offered. Finally my son who was treating for Mother's Day went to the front desk to complain. We did end up getting three of our meals free but were very disappointed in the service and food quality. This restaurant should be past the growing pains stage as they have been open for a couple of months. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Pickle Barrel and I am now dreaming of when I can go back.  Service was impecible, food was absolutely delicious.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Although the staff were good! The quality of the food wasn't great! We ordered PEI muscles and man it wasn't cooked! The manager took it back and it came with really hot sauce over it but the muscles weren't yet cooked! The chicken bites had part of the warm and part of them were cold! Makes me wonder if they were using a microwave to reheat food! It almost sounds like I paid a premium for Walmart frozen chicken getting heated in Microwave!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a group of friends. I always like how the seats are arranged in Pickle Barrel. We sat next to the window facing Yonge Street, so it was nice and bright.   I ordered the Mixed Berry Waffle, Jenny's Homemade Tiramisu, Samplers, Strawberry Banana Smoothie. The Waffle was actually really good. Sometimes I hesitate to get mixed berry anything at stores because I wonder if it's going to be frozen or fresh fruit. But this was all fresh and very delicious. My smoothie was good - in fact it was finished way too early on. I absolutely loved the tiramisu. It's presentation was impressive and the taste was not too sweet- but enough to finish it without feeling sickening sweet. I tried some of the foods on my friends plate - but it was quite simple. So I'm glad I got my waffle.  Our waitress was also quite attentive to our needs (we were a group of 7 with kids), and was interactive with the kids as well. Very awesome. I'd definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. The service was okay - server was competent but the food was absolutely disgusting. Every item ordered tasted awful.  Each one of us left almost our entire meal on our plates. And no the server didnt ask if there was anything wrong with the food. We left there and had to go eat somewhere else after dropping 50 dollars on dinner. This place has the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant. Only writing this to maybe save people from wasting thier hard earned money on this place. Honestly surprised this PB is still in business."}
{"text":"I recently ate at the pickle barrel and the overall experience was pretty good.  The service was very fast although my particular waitress wasn't overly warm.  The garden salad was excellent, filled with mixed greens, lots of veggies and an excellent sweet balsamic dressing.  I also had a deli burger which includes hot pastrami, and swiss cheese.  It was quite good for a chain restaurant burger, my only complaint being it was a little sloppy on the assembly.    This is a chain restaurant, so don't expect the best meal of your life.  However, if your at Yorkdale, looking for decent food at a good price and fast service, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Good food bad service. The manager really needs to be on the ball with their wait  staff because they are clueless."}
{"text":"Bad experience. We were seated at a filthy table, not wiped down from last customer (even though the restaurant was virtually empty).  The menus and call button were so dirty we were afraid to touch them.  The waiter was inattentive, the food was terrible.  I ordered the tapas style dishes.  Everything was cold and no better than I could have done in the microwave at home.  There was one waiter who was wearing a black shirt.  When I asked if he was the manager he replied \"soon to be.\"  So I expressed that we had a bad experience.  He listened but offered nothing, not even an apology.  We will NEVER come back to this location.  No wonder the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I waited two hours for my food to arrive (delivery) and it is ice cold. I got the Santa Fe quinoa bowl and the dressing tastes like vomit. I have nothing else to say, other than ew!"}
{"text":"Had some takeout here on this snowy evening. I forgot how bland this food is. I got the 3 cheese gnocchi and while it's very soft there's not much flavor to it even with the goat cheese stuffed inside. Since moxies got rid of their avocado spring rolls I decided to get the avocado egg rolls from here. The sauce is too strong with it and sweet. The egg rolls were way too overcooked and it was painful to chew on my teeth. The filing inside wasn't too bad. I thought maybe it would have redeemed itself after not eating here so long. This will be the last time I'll be getting food from here. I think you're best bet is to just get a wrap or something from here. I've been to 4 locations of the pickle barrel and they all have proven to be a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about ten times. This was due to the fact that I gave it a few chances, and the other times I was sadly meeting friends there, who were clueless about how this place is.  This Pickle Barrel has two main problems: a lack of cleanliness, and a generally lousy staff.  Firstly, the place just is not clean. Out of all the times I have been there, I have always experienced receiving at least one fork or knife rolled in my white napkin that had a fair amount of somebody else's meal on it. I also find it gross how most of their white cloth napkins have some human hair wrapped in them; which usually varies in size and quantity. Moreover, every once in a while you get your ice cream in a glass cup that reeks of that smell one's dishes have when one has failed to properly wash off the residue of chicken, beef, or eggs that came into contact with them in the sink or dishwasher.  Furthermore, the staff doesn't seem to want to be there, and try to make an absolute bare-minimum effort in terms of serving their customers. Most of them can barely even crack a smile.   Also, the servers are even rude and argue with one another. For example, I once went there with some people for a friend's birthday, and our waiter had to nearly beg his fellow-servers to gather to sing Pickle Barrel's lousy birthday song for my friend.  In terms of the food, it's decent, but nothing special. But it's pretty hard to enjoy eating any food with semi-unwashed cutlery, while being served by somebody who couldn't care less about their job.This place is just awful!"}
{"text":"It's.....well, it's a Pickle Barrel.  That used to mean something else, when I was growing up - in high school, Pickle Barrel were an easy, go-to solution for people who have differing tastes.  It made everyone happy.  Then, one day maybe 10 years ago, I remembered ordering my beloved Greek salad and it came with basically lettuce and nothing else.  For $11.99.  And I knew something terrible had happened.  This Pickle Barrel is no different.  I ordered a turkey-avocado club -- their words, not mine!  A \"club\" suggests layers of bread, but this was just your ordinary sandwich between two slices of bread.  Instead of having real turkey, it was slimy luncheon meat, and the avocado was so minuscule I actually asked the server if there was avocado on the sandwich, he said, \"Oh, no, I guess not,\" took it back, opened the sandwich up, noticed the one mm of avocado and brought it back saying, \"Oh, no, it is there.\"  This sandwich that would have cost me $1.50 at home cost me $10.99.  We asked for waters three times before he finally brought us any.  Really, there's no draw to this place at all, except for holding on nostalgia (i.e. a great place to bring older people who don't want to try anything new)."}
{"text":"Came here for dine in in the afternoon and was very impressed with the decor right upon entering. Service was also great - very attentive hostess. However, i wasn't too impressed when my pasta came out (sausage penne, asked for no cheese or onions). It was really lacking sauce (which was amazing so I definitely would've liked more). The pasta came with a side of soup or salad. I chose Caesar salad which had very few croutons, especially compared to my partner, which was a bit of a letdown. I didn't touch much of my salad in-restaurant so I packed it up to-go. Upon opening the container this morning (and a couple of bites in) I found an orange bug hiding in between the lettuce. Safe to say my entire appetite was ruined. I understand these things happen but it doesn't make me any less disgusted. Hopefully I can bring myself to this establishment once again and enjoy a better experience"}
{"text":"Kay so Nancy C emailed me and copy pasta'd and called me \"Sara S.\" instead of by my actual name which goes to show that these people really don't care whether or not its the disgusting, unhealthy, hazardous food their serving or their lack of customer service from their waiting staff. There is literally no point in going here other than to get sick and get automated emails of past emails they sent. Like who is Sara S. My name is no where near similar to that of Sara S.    That shows how much care Nancy C has for this business when she can't even edit out the name she used in her last email with the name of the person who theyre actually referring to.   And just to let you know one of your managers came out and offered the refund and a replacement food but its like, if you cant fix your kitchen staff from months ago when people have been complaining since forever that your food sucks, what makes my one little encounter going to open their eyes now? There was nothig wrong with any of your staffs behaviour in fact I could really not care because service is one thing, but a restaurants all about food. Your service means nothing if you dont have the food. lol."}
{"text":"Service has always been hit and miss at this location. I can't remember when my take out order was even remotely correct. The meat is what brings me there and the terrible service drives me away. To be fair I brought a few buddies there for lunch a while back and the wait service was great and the food even better. No complaints that day from anyone. Take out prices went up 50 % last year and that is why I am no longer frequenting this chain as I used to ( I was a customer  for over 20 years).."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a quick meal before watching a movie and we had an okay experience. We asked the hostess if we would be able to place out order, eat and pay within one hour and she said it was possible.   Once we were seated, it was really difficult to get our waitresses attention. She didn't visit our table for at least 10 minutes once we were seated. Then it took another 10 minutes to receive glasses of water. By this time I was parched. Our meals arrived 20 minutes after this and I asked for our bills at this time so we could pay and get to our movie.  The food was okay but it was nothing to write home about. We are really quickly and ran to get our tickets. I'm not sure I would return here for a quick meal. This location is more of a two hour situation."}
{"text":"At the Pickle Barrel for lunch, ordered soup which was too salty & then my Father's lunch plate came. Smoked Salmon on dark rye but wait! It comes with hair from the kitchen & certainly not my Dad's!!! Server apologized no sign of a manager anywhere. Pretty upset. Do not recommend it here. The decor was my highlight."}
{"text":"This is my third time at this specific location. At first, the service was great, but my second time it dimmed down and by the third time here, the service dropped. Location wise, it is located in a corner of a busy intersection with a nice view. Interior is well decorated and kept clean. I feel that taste wise, it also dropped each time I came here. The third time I cam eh ere I ordered my favourite dish which I've really enjoyed the first time I came but this time, the portion was significantly smaller and quite dry. The chicken was very dry and lacked sauce. I waited a good 10 minutes to get any waiters attention (btw two ignore me completely after seeing my hand). Finally after telling the waiter they took another 10 minutes to get the sauce. By then I pretty much finished my meal which was quite disappointing. I really enjoyed coming here but after my second and third experience here, I'm contemplation whether I should give it another try or not."}
{"text":"Worse service ever.  Went early 6 PM and restaurant half full.  Told to wait as they don't have enough servers. She started a wait list but needed to borrow a pen from a customer.  Told to wait 5-10minutes. After 15 minutes someone comes to the front and sees the list and asks guy in front of him if he's on the list. He says yes and he goes to sit him down. Trouble is guy was fourth on the list bypassing us.  Guy didn't care as we then left to go to a restaurant that respects you.  Never again PB, your service over the years stinks.  Today was the last straw.  Thanks for your quick reply Nancy.  Unfortunately it is too late as service at this location is well known for bad service and PB seems to turn a blind eye to it.  I will let our circle of friends know about my experience yesterday and everyone can judge for themselves.  As for us, never again"}
{"text":"We came during a weekday for dinner so it was pretty quiet and service was decently quick. Waitress is friendly and environment is tidy. Unfortunately the food experience was not the greatest. We ordered a medium rare steak and it was very tough to chew. Tasted like a frozen steak that they put unto the grill. The fries were thick and super dry - again tasting like frozen package  (McCain's taste better). Veggies are also frozen that are steam and flavourless. Finally, the barely soup isn't much of a soup.. it taste like those alphabet canned soup. It was an overall disappointing experience. I do not recommend this location. There are definitely better locations. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and the bill took more than 20 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"Everything is ok here. The dining room is very nice. The food is ok. Some plates are better than others. We've had a mixed bag of servers. Some are great. Some are pretty passive. The good thing is that we've never had to wait to be seated. We've always been able to walk in to a table."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was pretty good, and prices weren't too expensive. We got the chicken parm and the veggie burger (separate bills) and each meal was under $25. I would recommend going. It's also fairly close to demetres, (5 min walk??) if you feel like going somewhere different for dessert."}
{"text":"I had the Jumbo Shrimp Linguine. It was good, but took some time to be made. I came at 2:00pm and they weren't so busy, yet still took long. Recommended if in the area."}
{"text":"Looking for \"healthy\" foods nearby somehow I ended up at Pickle Barrel. Ordered my usual Luau chicken salad and was sadly disappointed. The crispy wonton is much smaller than at the other locations where I had this. The dressing was lacking in volume as well as in taste. And the saddest part was the avocado! They have this \"version\" of what is almost an unrecognizable avocado that seems to be soaked in some sort of preservatives that gives it a yellowish tint. I've encountered this before at a Druxy's at York. Both the taste and texture of the avocado is completely altered, you can't tell if you are eating display foods. If you can't get fresh avocados then don't put in avocados! It was completely disgusting and of course I didn't eat the avocados from another planet.   The service is mediocre as usual and now the food is bad. I definitely will not have this salad again!"}
{"text":"Well, we knew being a brand new location in Pickering, we had to keep our \"patience hats\" on, which we did. We waited an hour for our meals to be served and it was not overly busy. There was 6 of us, and only 5 meals came out. My husband was asked \"didn't you order anything?\", and he told them yes, to which they came back to say (after checking) that his order was never entered into the system. It was a seafood penne pasta dish, and eventually came out to him (now about 90 mins after we arrived) and the rest of us had already finished our meals. We didn't complain, as we  understood they were still \"working out some kinks\", but what was off putting to me was that the server never once offered to take the $19 meal off our bill, nor did she offer my husband a free beverage or dessert for the mishap. All she said was \"I'm sorry about that\". I went onto pickle barrel's website to leave customer feedback, and got a reply saying \"someone will get back to you\". It's been 7 days since we visited this Pickering location and I still have not had a reply as of yet. It's a shame because we were excited to frequent this location with friends, family and even colleagues, but without the restaurant acknowledging what happened and without any type of offering from the server, I can't see us going back. Food was \"okay\", but it was more the service that was disappointing."}
{"text":"I was sayin the other day it's been a while since someone wowed me.  Blessed me was wowed last night by the friendly staff at the Pickle Barrell.   I dig the hours here open late till 11 or midnight nice for dodging the Mother's Day dinner rush and Raptors game.  Quick wait for our table while I inhaled a large pint of Stella at the bar. The screen set up is every sports fan's wet dream with the game in every direction...good for when I need to tune out the girlfriend.   Our server was fantastic...even the manager dropped by to check in and ask how we was doing...I was doin' good with a face full of Montreal smoked on marble rye thank you very much.  The Montreal Smoked is legit and almost as good as what you'd find at a place like Schwartz's in Montreal served hot with choice of gravy and quality mustards."}
{"text":"Went here with my friends and the service we got was unbelievably rude. He treated us with disrespect and took advantage of us simply because we are teenagers. We get seated and it takes him at least a good half hour to taker order while he passed back and fourth near our table. If we wanted hot sauce we were not rude in asking saying \"Give me some f**king hot sauce!\". There were more please and may I, sorry to trouble you. The waiter would roll hi eyes as if we were saying something rude to him. Towards the end when my friend asked for a moist hand wipe, he was rude and said \"We give those out for rib orders, theres a washroom right there can't you use that?\" How rude, then came the bill, he passed by at least 6 times, and when he glanced down to look at what my friend was paying with which a $50 dollar bill, he grunts, rolls his eyes and walks away. 10 minutes later after telling him we were in a hurry, he comes back and says to my friend with aggravated behaviour, \"Look I can't take that! You have to go to the take out area to get change!\" When he took a fifty from the table across us. I can't express anymore how angry I was with this service. Paul or Peter whatever his name is should be fired."}
{"text":"Highly anticipated but what a letdown. I ordered a Montreal smoked meat on onion bun with side of onion rings, husband ordered same but on rye. When the orders came, both were on stale rye bread. I sent mine back to get the onion bun, when I finally got it the bun was cold and also stale.   There was almost no meat in either sandwich and both the poutine and onion ring were cold.  Won't order this here ever again. Debating whether we'll even come back.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel at Promenade Mall has got to be the worst Pickle Barrel of the whole chain--it is almost an embarrassment to the brand. Don't get me wrong--I love Pickle Barrel. I swear by the Rose Reisman's warm chicken spinach salad, however, this location has left a sour taste in my mouth all of the times I have been there.   Where can one even begin. I will start with hygiene. It is dirty. Tables are not cleaned right away, and there's dirty dishes lying around everywhere. For the full two hours that I was sitting down, no one cleaned the tables beside us. And the restaurant was pretty much empty. Where are the bus boys? They were clearly there, but obviously, no one is working. The floor is dirty. There's garbage everywhere. How can I trust that the environment which my food is being prepared in is even clean?  Which brings me to my second point--horrible service, horrible management. The waiters are lazy, not to mention unprofessional. Two waiters had a full out five minute conversation IN FRONT of us--one waiter asking the other to not seat us in their section because he was simply too busy. What kind of service is this? Who trained these people? Since when do you get to PICK AND CHOOSE how many people you wait for, when they're IN YOUR SECTION? The restaurant was empty, yet this guy didn't want TWO extra people in his section. Despicable.   The food took 45 minutes to come. For God's sake--it was two salads. My napkin had hairs in it, and my chicken was cold. This was no warm chicken spinach salad.   Just please--save your money and your nerves and don't come to this location."}
{"text":"Way too noisy,  service is sub par, food was Meh... Go here only if you have too.. Never have a good exerpeiece at pb ... Save your money go to mcd"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pickle Barrel three times trying to give it a chance. My mistake. Portions small and not carefully prepared and prices high. Service is better at a drive thru. On two occasions our server disappeared and we had to get another server to go look for her/him. Not impressed at all and will not go back."}
{"text":"At PB today for quick breakfast.  All of the server staff stand around doing nothing, one was playing with her hair near where the food is picked up.  The only server who seems to be busy and knows what she is doing is a lady named Joey.  The rest of the servers all are pretty much useless."}
{"text":"I have a few friends that live in Thornhill, we always end up here for our weekend brunch gatherings because everyone can find something he/she will eat from their vast menu.   Enviro is comfy and casual enough to bring small kids. Food is decent enough for adults who care about how their food taste. We've always received efficient services, even though a large party with lots of little kids may require more time and attention.   Like Katrina L said, what else can you ask in a chain restaurant?   A bonus if you want to shop for \"asian\" grocery items -- there is a T&T in the same mall."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Wednesday evening.  The night started out right as the hostess was very friendly and personable and found us a table right away. This is the only positive thing I have to say.    We ordered pastrami sandwiches with swiss.   When the sandwiches came there was no cheese on them so the manager had one of the line cooks simply lift the bread and put a cold slice of cheese under each.  Our server was nowhere to be found and had to ask 2 other servers for a drink refill.  After 15 minutes we were brought back 2 glasses of water??    The cooks in the back can be constantly heard swearing in the back as well as they had workers carrying clear garbage bags full of waste throughout the restaurant!!  The supervisor personally apologized and comped 2 mini desserts.  Do yourself a favour and go to a different location"}
{"text":"What happened to this GREAT brand!? Such a shame..I remember a time when someone mentioned the Pickle Barrel and my mouth would water...now I think yuk!"}
{"text":"It's too bad I have to give this place such a poor review because the food on their very abundant menu isn't half bad. Let me start by pointing out the positive first:   The menu has just about anything you can think of. Whatever you're in the mood for will most likely be listed. The ambiance is nice enough; nice seating, nice lighting, etc, etc. The price is right and they have a great drink and dessert selection. So what's the problem?  ...Well, you know how the Jackson 5 said one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch?...Unfortunately, the service at this Yonge and Eglinton location just spoiled the entire silo...    Sigh... I probably won't ever go back to this location again after what happened and here's why:   I was there for dinner and drinks and from the start it didn't feel right. Our waitress took forever to greet us and the place wasn't even busy...No smile, no name, no connection at all from our server and first impressions usually mean a lot...even still, I was able to let it slide until I asked for separate bills.   The waitress rolled her eyes and kind of grunted/sighed as a response. When the food was served, it was pretty much slammed down in front of our faces and never once were our waters refilled. As the night wore on and the service got worse, we had a bet going on as to who would find a big gob of spit in their plates...(no one did, luckily).   The bills were wrong when given to us and when I asked for the manager to straighten it out I thought I was going to get my ears boxed! I'm not the type to complain or cause trouble at restaurants (side note: I've been a server before and I know first hand how stressful this job can be so I can empathize to a certain point) but the service was absolutely terrible. And when I thought the service couldn't get worse, the manager didn't even seem to care. Go figure.   All in all, you may have a better server and a better night than I did here; I certainly hope so. If you want a decent meal, Pickle Barrel isn't bad but don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great. My gnocchi was incredibly greasy. Would not recommend anyone coming here."}
{"text":"If I can give pickle barrel negative stars I would. I eat it out everyday, I have experienced both the Good and the Bad of Toronto's restaurant scene. Pickle Barrel is the worst restaurant I have ever entered. The food was late, cold and disgusting.  I hated every moment of it. They even managed to screw up french fries."}
{"text":"We just thoroughly enjoyed our meal here tonight. We had nachos for a shared app and then entres.  The service was quick friendly and our orders came out fast hot and delish!  On a side note there were two scammers at the next table complaining about everything so they could get free food drinks and desserts and the servers, manager and waitstaff had their hands full with these two con artists. Especially SCOTT two remained cool calm and collected!  The two con artists were high fiving each other with every free item they received. They clearly were there on a mission without enough money to pay for their meal. Way to go to the staff!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 3.5 star.  My bf and I came here on a Friday night at 7pm. It was quite busy but didn't have to wait long to be seated. We were greeted by our hostess and our server (Julia).  She was very nice and she got our orders right. I believe the head chef (not sure, but he's wearing grey culinary shirt) came to our table and asked us how our food was. He did that to a few tables. It feels nice for them to do that extra step. Service is great in this location! Although the bill did take a while to come.  Food: **we always order tje same thing at pickle barrel** we share everything.  Asian Nachos: good but portions are much smaller than before.   Calamari: no flavour on the breading (I don't taste salt or pepper at least).the sauce is good and the same at othet locations.  Manhattan Steak: Ordered Medium. We got WELL-DONE. The steak was tough amd very dry. I tried to eat it again and again but I couldnt. For a $25 dish, it's not worth it.  Unfortunately, our server didn't do quality check when our steak came so my bf ate it since as he was really hungry.i couldn't eat my portion and eventually, I lost my appetite.  As we were finishing out main meal, our server came to us and I told her that our steak is well done. She apologized and asked if I wanted a new plate. I declined as I didn't want to be a bother.  A few minutes later, she came to us and said that she spoke to her manager about the steak and they wanted to give a dessert on the house. Its unexpected but ordered Molten Lava Sundae. It's good (too sweet for my liking) and big. It can bw shared by 3 people.   Overall, I do hope they improve their quality when it comes to food. But I was happy with the service especially she acknowledged that the customer was not satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"Such a prime location at the corner of a growing and bustling Yonge and Eg deserves much better than this plain jane poop hole of a restaurant. Had breakfast here last Saturday...eggs were cold, coffee tasted burnt, service was slow and for the grand finale I found a hair in my pancakes....delicious....the best part of my meal was when they refunded it. For a good breakfast in the area, try Coquine Restaurant by Yonge and Davisville."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast, served quickly with very friendly and conscientious service. I ordered the Avocado Toast and had no regrets- it was excellent. Nice atmosphere and located in the Yorkdale Mall. Nice choice for any time of day- they serve breakfast , lunch and dinner. Made our visit from out of town pleasant."}
{"text":"Horrible food at high prices. They used to be good but now, all their foods are of very low quality and not cooked the way you ask for. Service is poor too and some of the staff are very rude. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"Im not the biggest fan of large chain restaurants. I like more speciality oriented  cuisines. However with that said, pickle barrel is the ideal place for me to have a hangover breakfast, especially this location. Its always the same thing. Steak and Eggs for $12. I think is the best value for a nice juicy 6oz and 3 eggs. Served with coffee. I always add cheese. I usually get the home fries however recently discovered the potato latkes. They are amazing. Other then that i dont really go to pickle barrel, unless of course its to drink a quick Hoegarden. The hoegarden on  tap tastes really good."}
{"text":"Sorta mediocre, never been impressed, wouldn't go here unless someone else wanted to go. Haven't found a dish I liked."}
{"text":"Y'know, it's not bad.  For a quick bite before a movie, a solo dinner with cocktail during a marathon Christmas shopping session, or a brunch, it's just fine.  The decor is pleasant, and it has an interesting view over Yonge & Eglinton.  Don't order anything that takes delicate or skilled preparation, and you'll be happy.  I've never had any problems with service myself."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've had Pickle Barrel! I came to this location after work with my friends and coworkers around 8:30 and there was still lots of space. We were served by Darryl who was knowledgeable about all the options on the menu. I ordered a Lychee Lemonade which was sooo goood! I also got the mushroom swiss with a super side of sweet potato fries (which costed an additional $2 for the upgrade). I loved the food, the mushrooms with onion rooms in the burger made it even more delicious. However, the portion of the side was too small for me. I could have eaten 2-3 of the sides, that's why I upgraded the side.  I would totally return to Pickle Barrel and specifically this location. I loved the atmosphere and experience."}
{"text":"if I could give this place zero stars I would.  I went to this $h1thole on my birthday with high expectations. man was I wrong.  the server was not only terrible at her job but she was also insulting.  after taking forever to get our drinks we waited another 30 min for her to take our order.  after a sub par meal we stared at our empty plates and drinks for at least 30 min before we waved down a server who wasn't even ours to get our bill so we could leave.  don't let the overly large menu fool you this place is not worth entering..."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Holiday Inn right next to it, after work didn't feel like driving anywhere so I would just walk across the street to the Pickle. Got the mixed berry salad which was amazing, love the feta and the nuts. Went back again got the same salad and bruchetta with feta, was amazing great place. Also excepts American Express, which alot of places in Canada do not. I will be back"}
{"text":"Went here two Fridays ago for an early dinner. Food was terrible and dried up. Service was slow, really really slow. The funny thing is that the restaurant was a mess but no one seemed worried about fixing it. Called the manager over who also didn't seem worried or like she wanted to fix anything. Didn't give a good reason why anything was so bad and just said to go and she would comp everything. What a disgrace, I left shaking with rage.     It's been many months since I wrote this review and they have yet to write back to me. Very disrespectful, I'm astonished a corporate place could do this to people. Going to deter anyone to go here to avoid such awful treatment and food. You should be ashamed of yourself and your company!"}
{"text":"It was a 30 minute wait to get in but we did go on a Saturday so that is understandable. We went as a big group and we were taken care of quickly. We all got the correct food that we ordered (even with special instructions). The server was very nice and friendly. We did not have to ask for any refills. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger with fries and it was delicious! The burger was nice and moist and the fries were some of the best I've ever had. The restaurant was clean and even though it was very busy, it still had a great atmosphere to it. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Our friends and I had dinner at the newmarket location on January the 23rd . Our experience  was just awful. Our server was  very rushed.  so rush you could ask her a question.my meal wasn't  what was described. the Manager Marlina called my cell on the 24th and left a voicemail  i returned her call within 2hrs of her calling but she wasn't there.  .I have  since called Back 5 times. and left messages for her. I now know  that she is avoiding my call as I just called again at 5.49pm  the 28th of January .The person that answered the phone went to get Marlina and came back after 3 mins to say Marlina wasn't in. This does not  sit well with me. Poor service and bad Management."}
{"text":"Quality service-location and price. Pickle barrel has been consistent for years"}
{"text":"1.5/5  Came here on a Wednesday for lunch, around 12 pm. It's close to work so I guess that's something, but that's about it. Ordered the Kung Pow Kung Pao bowl with Shrimp as I was not feeling any finger foods.   I guess the shrimp was alright, decently sized. Everything else, not so much....All the ingredients just felt overcooked and lacked taste. The \"sauce\" seemed just like watery soy sauce. And the noodles were more like spaghetti noodles than anything. Presentation wise, it looked alright except for the wooden chopsticks. Sure, there may not be many options that require chopsticks, but it felt like a food court meal more than anything else. For 14.99, I expected a bigger portion but also slightly better taste - not much value.   Service was decent, and luckily we were able to preorder to save some time. However, the food and value isn't up to par in the few times I've gone for work related lunches."}
{"text":"I understand that this restaurant is very busy, but I'd rather eat at the food court rather than wait 45 minutes for each meaI only to end up with a cold dish (I ordered the paella). I also found it also unprofessional that our waitress and her friend were counting their tips in front of us. I really enjoy the desserts here though, and one order can usually be shared with two people."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks really good. This is defenitely the place to go on hot summer days as the patio looks great. The menu is really extensive. The food was good. Service a little slow"}
{"text":"Arrived with a party of 20 to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday. The hostess that greeted us was amazingly friendly and very personable. We were introduced to our server Carl and a colleague Mike who would take care of us. The service throughout our meal was fantastic and the flavour of our meals was delightful. The eggs Benedict were wonderful and the lobster grilled cheese was equally good. A side of applewood smoke bacon was especially good but then it was bacon. The decor of the restaurant was great and our seating was very good as well. Unfortunately, the kitchen staff marred an otherwise amazing effort of the hostess and serving team. How hard is it to prepare toast. Similarly, while home fires are not the central ingredient in the meal, is it really that difficult to insure that they are adequately cooked. I continue to be astonished by home many restaurants find it a challenge to prepare toast. Is it really that hard to put to slices of bread through the high tech machine called a toaster and then apply butter insuring to cover the surface and then deliver still warm to the table? Where is the quality control that your reputation depends on? Why spend ridiculous amounts of money on interior design, construction, training of host and serving staff if your kitchen cannot handle such a simple thing like toast and home fries?  Outside of this seemingly overblown weakness, I compliment Carl who was very quick to try and correct the issue despite the protestation of my brother-in-law who by now had wanted simply to move on. Despite what I have read from other reviewer's here, service issues have been addressed and the staff are excellent. Great job front room staff! I would definitely go back and hope that my comments serve to elevate the game of the kitchen team."}
{"text":"I think this place is perfectly serviceable if you stick to the safe stuff (NACHOS!). Trying to go healthy was my mistake.   I came here with a group and unfortunately went for the lettuce wraps. New to Toronto, I didn't realize that this was a place where you should stick to the pub classics (ie. deep friend things).  Instead of crispy lettuce that is customary to a good lettuce wraps, you get soft lettuce that acts as a terrible vehicle for any kind of filling.  The filling... Was unfortunately, extremely salty. It was basically chicken seasoned with too much soy sauce and was inedible. And I don't like wasting food.  Our server was nice, he noticed at the end of the meal that I barely touched the lettuce wraps and immediately comped it for me. This simple gesture is the reason that I'm not going one star...  If comfort food is what they do best, I feel that they should leave this sort of thing off their menu."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday with 20 friends at this location a couple weeks ago. We had made a reservation and had to wait over half an hour for our table, as the group before us refused to leave. Fine. The manager gave us two portions of nacho appetizers to appease us. It worked, until our waiter decided to ruin the mood with his terrible attitude.   1- I asked for a ginger ale and a glass of water with lemon, then cancelled the ginger ale right ager saying it (I'm human, I changed my mind and apologized). He looked way too irritated for such a minor change. He proceeds to bring my water, without lemon. I said \"when you have a moment could you please bring lemon wedges for our water.\" He snapped at me and was unnecessarily rude.   2- he never, ever asked if anyone needed anything. A table of 20, someone always needs something.  3- when I asked for a refill he scoffed at me. Brought me my water which he proceeded to spill on my husband and put it in front of me. A few mins later he says, with attitude, \"do you want another??\" He clearly could see that I hadn't even had a sip at that point but was just being rude.   4- my friends asked for extra napkins and he was clearly pissed off about that.   More incidents like the above occurred, but I can't be bothered to go into more detail. I was very polite, as I always am, and did NOT appreciate his nonsense attitude. Not when I brought 20 people into the restaurant who contributed to the hefty gratuity he got to take home, undeserved."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The Asian nachos were amazing! And I fell in love with the tuna tacos."}
{"text":"Best deal of the day: Killer Shake (see picture). Big enough to satisfy your sugar cravings in its 35 oz mug!"}
{"text":"It was an okay experience. Our waitress did keep us waiting for a long time after we finished our food; it wasn't busy either and we just wanted to go but couldn't see her anywhere.  Overall, experience was okay - nothing special.   Food - Deep Fried Dills were delicious and the dipping sauce was perfect   - Crispy Fish Sandwich was eh. There was barely any sauce on there because the fish was extremely hot that the sauce melted away and I couldn't eat it. Had to take apart the sandwich to cut into the fish first to let it cool.   - The Great Reuben Sandwich was good.   Overall, it was okay."}
{"text":"My friend J and I went to the Pickle Barrel at Centerpoint Mall in North York last week for lunch and we had such a horrible experience. We were seated for long time and it took anyone long time to even come by to take our order. Our waitress was very rude and treated us poorly. After that, we waited for yet long time for the food. We also took a comment card and filled it while we were there, but we didn't trust that particular restaurant to leave it there - we were thinking of sending it in to the head office or something. Because the service was so slow and we didn't want to further wait for them to process our bill, we left cash in the bill folder. The bill came up to $38+ and we left $42 (2x$20 bill and a $2 coin - we must be crazy enough to even leave a tip). We then walked out of the restaurant. Almost immediately, that waitress chased out and said we did not pay enough, she said we only left a $20 bill, a $5 bill and a $2 coin. That was very strange because we left $42 there, and wonder how one of the $20 bills turned into a $5 bill. Why would we left $27 dollars (in bills and coin) for a bill that is $38+?! Anyways, she accused us of not paying enough. Because we had no proof that we really left $42 (she insisted that she only had $27) and we were in a rush(since they took so long give us food), we gave her another $15 in bills and asked back the $2 coin. So we were forced to pay $55 for a meal that only $38+.   We were very unhappy about this so my first reaction was that I wanted to tell Pickle Barrel head office later about this incident and hope they can do something to correct it. I called up the head office number and was told that someone will call me back, and she did. The customer relation person listened and said she would investigate and get back to us. My friend J also emailed her about the incident.  Few days later, she sent me back a response that seemed so generic that made us even more mad. We wrote her back to tell her that we were not happy about that \"generic\" response. I guess she probably decided not to deal with this anymore - we never heard back from her again. Pickle Barrel must have really lost their mind to have a customer relations person like that. We have originally decided to avoid the PB at Centerpoint in the future, but after dealing with the customer \"bad\" relation person, now we will not go to any PB anymore.   S"}
{"text":"Avocado Toast  The side salad went beautifully with this fresh dish. I felt like the hollandaise sauce which is optional ... could use some work. It seemed like it was sitting around for some time and was a little two thick. Overall delicious. It was so quiet on a Saturday morning at 10am. This location use brand new ... it opened in March 2018. So don't let the lack of yelp reviews fool you. It's behind the Moxies not inside Pickering Town Centre."}
{"text":"I've dined in at the Yorkdale location about 5 times now and I don't know why I keep going back because there are plenty of other restaurants that I would rather spend my money on.  Probably due to the reason being is that its location is conveniently located in the mall which gives you the option when you don't want to eat at the food court.  The greeters and hostess at the front are not professional and again I guess it depends on the time of day you visit.  The most recent visit, it was two very young staff who were talking to each other and laughing and didn't really attend to us.  Finally they finished talking and asked us how many....we were seated.    Our server was very friendly and nice.  My friend ordered a chopped steak and it was not good, a frozen package from the grocery store could have tasted better.  I ordered the Greek feta burger and it was very delicious!    They have such a large menu that it's hard to specialize is everything so only a limited amount of dishes are good but you would have to guess and pick to find out.  Overall this is my typical chain restaurant that I would go to when I have absolutely nowhere else to visit, def not a top choice."}
{"text":"I was debating between 2 and 3 stars, but I will go with 2.4 I've been to the Pickle Barrel at Yorkdale a few times over the past 10 years, and some visits were great, but most were sub-par.   Experience at PB is directly correlated with the server you get. Some are decently attentive, while most don't really care. We've had missed orders, mains coming our before salads, apps coming our after we finished eating, and dirty and broken plates. I understand this is a really busy location, but they have been consistently mediocre.   The menu has changed over the years, so I guess you can always try something new. I've never been a big fan of the Rose Reisman menu items...Yes, I know it's low in calorie. It tastes like so! Just not enough flavour.   I'd probably come back again, considering it's one of the cheaper dining options at Yorkdale.  My favourite thing: The drinks are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of my favourite places to go, I went with my friend yesterday and the service was terrible. Our server forgot about us multiple times. We had to literally hunt a staff member down three times to order appetizers, food and drinks. I was expecting a lot more. Unfortunately the quality of service here has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend at Yorkdale and we decided to eat at one of the restaurants there, we were hoping to catch the Raptors game and so asked to be seated in the bar area, and then we find out that they don't have tsn2 so that was disappointing.   We got seated at 8pm, by 8:20 no one had even come to introduce themselves as our waitress, and so we told this to our hostess and she apologized and said she would get on it, 10 minutes later, no one even glanced our way when we were clearly doing the whole looking around thing that people do to get the attention of anyone and then we decided to just leave as it was getting ridiculous.  We were also sitting in a very heavily trafficked area, so I honestly do not know what was going on with them. Completely horrible and it was something I had never experienced in all my eating out in Toronto.   In terms of my previous visits to Pickle Barrels, it used to be one of those places that we would go to eat just because we had no idea how much greener the grass was on the \"other side\" aka most other places. I would not recommend anyone come to Pickle Barrel, if you must eat at Yorkdale, go check out their food court or Milestones or something.   Pickle Barrel has a large menu which is just a bit over priced, but I must admit that you're probably going to find whatever food you're in the mood for. It's not horribel food, but there are better options out there. On it's best day I could see myself giving a Pickle Barrel a 3 star rating, but that's never happened to me so far."}
{"text":"The location looks really nice and fancy inside.. it looks like they renovated recently. The service is good.  Prices are decent.  They have a large selection of food and desserts however the food has just never tasted amazing for me, just satisfactory lol."}
{"text":"Not coming back again. Food comes to your table cold , salty and tasteless.  Kids grilled cheese came cold with horse carrot and a dark spoiled celery stick.  The fajitas are overpriced for the microwave grade meal. Not sure if the salsa was actually a tomato sauce...lettuce is low grade iceberg type    Friday evening , all families with kids are dining and they play WWF on the big screen- Very inappropriate!   Service was alright, similar to Tim Hortons.   Overall experience is bad, will not recommend."}
{"text":"Went with my son for lunch. Place was moderately busy, not busy enough for us to be seated and ignored for between 10-15 minutes.  However, we could not complain about the food, it was very good. We both had the full rack of ribs and it was very tender with a sauce that was just right, not too thick or sweet, I had the banana split and my son had the red velvet cake. Mine was good and a great deal for the price but the cake was a little on the dry side. He compared it to Swiss Chalet cake and it was nowhere near as good. NOW FOR THE PROBLEM Whilst we were eating dessert and I was discussing that I would finish off with a latte and my son was debating another beer, we were brought the bill that we NEVER asked for. As far as I'm concerned they should NEVER bring the bill until I ask for it or they ask me if I want it (2nd option still not the best etiquette) but they now not only irritated me by jumping the gun but they lost money. After being given the bill I take it as a business that wants me to leave and does not want any more of my money.  We paid and left. PB you need to learn the correct etiquette"}
{"text":"I keep on trying with the hope that one day the service will get better because they have a pretty extensive menu that isn't half bad but man, the service absolutely sucks. Everyone is pleasant enough, we haven't experience any true rudeness but if you don't mind waiting 45min in an empty restaurant this is the place for you.  They are constantly understaffed and overwhelmed which constantly results in slow service and you'd better hope that you have everything you need and your order is 100% correct because good luck getting your server to come back and check on you. This place is super close to my in-laws and it keeps getting suggested and we keep getting disappointed everything we come. (Written waiting in line at another restaurant after being told they couldn't seat us (with plenty of empty seats) because the servers were overwhelmed)"}
{"text":"The burger I ordered was good, however the service was horrible. My server was very impatient with not only my table, but with every other table he was serving and he SCOFFED at me when I paid in cash. Restaurant has to reevaluate their staff and get rid of people like this.   As for the UberEATS portion, whenever you request for something to be added or left off, your request is completely ignored. I've completely stopped ordering from them via UberEATS as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant has been open a week and a half so I expected growing pains.  Amazingly this place was packed (10-20 minute wait for tables at 5PM). I have dined at the Yonge/Dundas location in the past, but it has been several years and it seems the quality has gone down and prices have gone way up.  I had the Thick Cut Pastrami sandwich ($15)... the meat was fine -- juicy, had the right spice taste, etc -- but the bun was dry and crumbly, obviously stale. I wonder if it sat in the kitchen for the past 2 weeks...  It was so bad I didn't finish all of the bun, and just ate the pastrami with some mustard spread on it.   Perusing the rest of the menu, holy sticker shock Batman!  (I guess when your neighbours are Moxie's and Jack Astor's, similarly overpriced \"generic McSysco Bar and Grill\" places, you can get away with it...)  And as I finished the meal, the server came around with the \"mini dessert sampler\" which could best be described as chocolate mousse/pudding in tiny shot glasses, like you'd see at a Chinese all you can eat buffet. And they want $3 for just ONE of those?  (if you want the whole tray of 8 that would be $20)  Really?  I was not impressed and will not be returning... Those prices need to come down bigtime."}
{"text":"Guys please ignore this review if you like slow service and average food.  Now for the people who want to know how this Pickle Barrel \"Promenade location\"  rates according to me. This restaurant needs more waiters, also the door greeters need an attitude adjustment. It seemed that they were bothered upon my presence. I had a humus chicken wrap, it was lacking flavour, I had to add salt to it at every bite. The soup wasn't that good either, the chicken tortellini needed something, oh yes a little flavour.  I hate giving negative reviews, but I'm afraid this time I must once again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location although I've been to several others in the GTA.  The menu has so many choices it's overwhelming.  But, I've never had a bad meal at any Pickle Barrel.  The server had a sense of humour which is always a plus.  My only complaint is that I had to ask twice for a slice of lemon for my water.  It was a busy Saturday night so I understand he had a lot on his plate (pun intended).  If I ran a restaurant with the word 'pickle' in the title, I would include pickles with most of the dishes or set some pickle slices on each table like some restaurants do with bread.  The Pickled Ceasar was delicious and did come with nice garnishes including a pickle."}
{"text":"This location has got to be hands-down THE WORST one out of all of the locations I've eaten at...and well I've been to most of the ones around the GTA because All-Day Breakfast is my weakness and when you work in malls, PB is usually the only place where you can get that anytime you crave it T_T  I love eggs. I can actually make them almost every style...except for the expensive one..what's it called? I can't remember. Anyway, I always get their 3 eggs any style with the sausage and latkes and toast.  When I order my eggs a certain way, I expect them to be made that way, since I'm paying so much more than a carton of eggs FOR THREE EGGS MADE THAT WAY. [sorry I'm just reliving the moment when I ate my eggs from here]  They were still raw. Like, the stuff was still clear and gross. I'm pretty sure over easy you're supposed to have fried both sides and only the yolk stays a little runny.  Anyway, I learned my lesson for the next time and told them exactly how I wanted my eggs. Unfortunately, this translated to: oh let's burn the egg.  So that was the end of that. I just asked for scrambled eggs from then on because seriously, who can mess up scrambled eggs -__-ll  What really turned me away from their breakfast after that was the potato latkes. They used to be these cute little potato pancake type things. Sorta like a hashbrown...in it's natural form haha I mean, not like super flat, but not the width of a MUFFIN.  YAH I GOT LATKES THAT WERE AS BIG AS MUFFINS. IT WAS DISGUSTING. I looked at them and asked the server, are these the latkes? I think this is a roasted potato or something...it's huge.  but nope, those were the new latkes. I almost cried. That should never happen to potatoes.   Now, I'm a pretty understanding person since I work in retail and the Promenade mall's patrons are usually among the most difficult...so I am sympathetic to all employees of this mall.  What I don't understand is how these servers think it is alright to completely ignore someone who is waving them down. I only waved because I waited patiently for 20mins for someone to come by and nobody did.  If I ask for ketchup [for my ridiculously doughy latkes] or a refill or even extra napkins, I get a heaving sigh as if I had already asked them three times or something. Well, that's not possible because YOU NEVER COME BY. Sometimes, they disappear with my glass and don't come back for another 20mins. One time, I even got an empty ketchup bottle!   The worst is when I need to GO. Like, I've been done eating for 20mins and nobody comes by and I need to pay and leave. I wait another 15mins for someone to come by so I can ask them for the bill. THEN I have to wait another 15mins for them to COME BACK with the bill. THEN ANOTHER 15MINS BEFORE THEY COME TO TAKE MY MONEY. heaven forbid i have to use my debit card because that'll just earn me another heaving sigh and another 20min wait while they stand at the cash register machine and go through the prompts at a snail's pace.   Oh, and you'd think that their take-out area would be less of a hassle. Like, perhaps you wouldn't have to deal with the incompetency of the wait staff.  NO. I don't even know what they do there because I asked for some pasta salad that IS ALREADY PREPACKAGED///JUST REQUIRED SOME SCOOPING INTO A PLASTIC CONTAINER AND I'M THE ONLY ONE IN LINE AND IT STILL TAKES 15MINS FOR THEM TO DO THAT ONE THING.   Why do I even have so much experience here? You'd think I'd learn and not come back. Unfortunately, I'd been working at that mall for 2 years so I had to deal with it during that time.   I'm glad to say every other location has treated me a gazillion times better AND their food is yummier =) just this location sucks.   HIRE NEW SERVERS PLEASE. and fix your latkes. I can do scrambled eggs but muffin latkes are not yummy."}

{"text":"Went their with my wife and kids and it took about 10 minutes to be seated in an empty place.  Then about 15 minutes for orders!  My wife went to the bathroom and cut herself on broken glass!  A waitress got her a bandaid and then the manager  said she saw no broken glass in the washroom even though my wife and other customers said so!  I had a 5 and a 2 year old with us and if they got hurt I would of sued the place dry!  The only good spot was that the waitress was very friendly but I am never taking my family here again!  This place is extremely poorly managed!"}
{"text":"This place is just terrible in every sense! The hostess is rude and when I pointed out the name she took was spelt wrong, she glared at me and told me she pronounces it that way so tough. WOW ok maybe she is having a bad day I thought? I decided to order the Nachos with meat sauce. It was alright and I think out of everything I ordered, that was the best thing. My friend ordered the pasta and I ordered the strip loin medium. When I got my steak I was surprised it wasn't still Moving- it was raw!!! I told my waiter and he was nice but when he brought my steak back it was beyond burnt and well done.. At this point I lost interest in my steak and ate around it. The potatoes were crunchy and the vegetables were not even remotely close to being steamed properly. Won't be coming back at all!"}
{"text":"I was dragged back to the pickle barrel by my friends. My last review at this franchise ended in me puking all night after some badly cooked chicken and waffles and this visit was hardly different. I find this restaurant line in particular only really good for some appetizers and drinks. Otherwise their menu is overwhelmingly long (10-12 pages?!) But it doesn't actually SAY much! I don't want to be flipping through a novel for 20 minutes to just settle on an appetizer because I don't care to read to the part where Harry unlocks the chamber of secrets. I decided to play it safe and get calamari and a beer, which were both fine, but my friend who ordered a steak found hair in his salad, and my other friend who got a large salad for dinner found moldy raspberries in it. This restaurants only saving grace is that the manager was so helpful and offered to cover the meals of the two friends who mentioned the poorly prepared food. We were pleasantly surprised at her quick action to mitigate the situation, however, our server had almost zero reaction when we shower her the hair and moldy raspberry, and didn't even bother to bring it to the managers attention without us asking to speak to her directly. Overall, fool me twice - shame on me."}
{"text":"1.5 stars out of 5.  The good - The service was excellent because the waitress made arrangements when we needed to add an extra spot for our reservations.  The bad - The food.  We ordered chicken fingers and fish and chips.  We figured, you can't mess then up... We were wrong.  The halibut fish was bad.  The batter want crispy.  It tasted like those frozen fish you get from the supermarket.  Even Burrito Boyz's halibut fish was done better.  The coleslaw was passable.  The chicken fingers didn't have much meat.  They looked very sad.  Even jackastors chicken fingers were better (St. Louis chicken fingers are the best in our opinion).  The fries were not crispy.  I don't think they were fresh either.  The gravy was good.  It helped us finish the fries.  We didn't want to go to Pickle Barrel since we never had a great experience with them.  We only went because the group decided.  With the prices they charge, the food's pretty crappy.  Won't be going if we could help it."}
{"text":"So it was my last day visiting with my friend over the weekend and she begged and begged me to take her here because she was just \"dieing\" for some Blintzes. She says she used to get them here when she was younger and has such fantastic memories of their taste that she wanted to get them again. Alright, I relented and granted her wish like the fantastic genie that I am.   After wading through Sunday morning traffic and dealing with finding the proper parking spot in the garage making it so we don't have to walk miles, we arrived at a semi busy PB. We were sat halfway around the earth towards the back. Sheesh, I never knew  a place could be this vast in Toronto. Most restaurants we eat in are the size of  closets and elbow room is a gift when it happens. So after walking the ring to Mordor across the valley of fire and the plains of sorrow we arrived at our table and presented with what appeared to be \"The Codex Gigas\" (Google it if you like). Our Server \"Ben\" came to the table with relative speed, relative like how the polymorphic solid known as \"Glass\" moves. (You are now smarter) It probably took a good 10 minutes for him to get to our table to introduce himself and explain the specials they had. I ordered us waters and sent him off on his way.    All the while I was watching my friend quickly turn page after page after page, forward, backward, forward, backward, looking more and more confused. And then her confusion changed to horror, and then horror morphed into anger.  I didn't even need to hear her speak. Blintzes, were nowhere to be found in this entire codex of non nutrition. I almost saw a tear well up in her eye as she couldn't grasp how they were not on the menu.   When Ben finally returned with our waters another 5 minutes later it was painfully obvious that there was a problem with the look of consternation on my friend face. I took the reigns and decided to spin a tale of woe that was by no means true but it sure sounded great.  I explained how I lived 8 hours away and I made this trip especially for my friend recommendation of how fantastic their blintz's were. I made such an epic tale of this journey and my inability to eat breakfast the way it was explained I think I made the table behind me weep openly, or maybe it was the fact they put too much pepper onto their pasta, either way, it was an emotional moving experience.  Ben stared in disbelief at the staggering tale of heartache and death that followed me to be in his presence this morning, and now he needed to be the one to tell me that they took them off the menu a few weeks ago.  Man it was hard to keep a straight face through all of this, but it did cheer up my girl. Ben had a look as he walked away as though I had kicked his puppy, I'm quite certain I made his day. Anyway, I am rambling on here.. Lets get onto the food.  After the initial shock passed for my lady sank in that she would never taste what she longed for, she decided that a Belgian waffle would be the next thing on her pallet. After reading War and Peace I settled on the BBQ Chicken Quesadilla and a Chicken Pasta dish.  The Quesadilla came out in about 10 minutes  and was well presented. I snapped a picture of it and then took a bite. Promptly burning the h*ll out of my hand when the sauce shot out the back and it just so happened to be lava. Water and rags cooled the burn and after the food chilled I managed to eat the rest of it. Not a bad flavor, but it needed some more chicken.  20 minutes later the food came out and it was pretty tasty. Unfortunately my burning hand took my concentration away and I did not get a picture of the pasta or her waffle, but come on, it's a waffle.  You've seen one, you've seen them all. Although it was not a Blintz she seemed to enjoy eating it, and my pasta was pretty tasty. A little light on the garlic but the pasta was cooked very well. The garlic bread or should I say brick that came out I'm pretty sure was baked last year due to the hardness. I probably could have used it to break concrete. Soaking it in the sauce for the duration however enabled me to give it a try, and it tasted ok.   On my way to the bathrooms, which by the way are completely on the other side of the universe in this place, I passed the desert case, I thought that the mini parfaits would be a great way to round out the meal so I got a Rocky Road mini to finish everything off. In Summary, I didn't have a bad experience at this spot I just wish I had my camelbak water jug to combat the dehydration I felt when walking to and from my table.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I didn't even need to exercise that week. Ok that's enough rambling, this is bordering on absurdly pointless."}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant good customer service the food was average restaurant quality worth the cost."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Everything was mediocre. Nothing heated properly. Eggs tasted like they had been made hours ago and microwaved (very grainy). Soup had a bit of a funny after taste... at least the milkshake was decent (but not great).  ... to their credit, the restaurant did take the eggs off the bill when we complained. Reasonably good service - very friendly."}
{"text":"What do you do when there's a 25 minute wait time at Milestones next door? Go to Pickle Barrel, of course!   My best friend was visiting from Vancouver and we were excited to have dinner together for the first time in over a year.   We were sat right away, but it took a while to be greeted by our server. We got our drink and food orders in right away because we were ravenous. Drinks arrived shortly after they were ordered and so did our mac and cheese popper appetizers. Mac and cheese poppers were good and presented nicely on a banana leaf and metal basket, but it only came with a side of ketchup as a dipping sauce, which is a huge let down.  I was excited to see that Pickle Barrel now serves lobster grilled cheese and for way less than Joeys. I guess you get what you pay for because I was so incredibly underwhelmed with my food. First of all, my sandwich was tiny. It was like they used the butt end of the loaf to make it. To say that it is a grilled cheese is a joke, since there was barely any cheese in it. It was also bone dry, like, no butter was used on the bread. Decent amount of lobster and I liked that it was served with some spinach in there to give the illusion that this sandwich was sort of healthy. I upgraded my side to sweet potato fries and they were also underwhelming. Too chunky, not crispy, and served at room temperature, as if they had some extra sweet potato fries from a previous order and threw them onto my plate.   My friend got the chicken grilled cheese and she also commented on how dry it was. She didn't finish her food. My fiancé got the fish tacos and said they were mediocre.  I guess that's what to expect when you have a menu as big as Pickle Barrel's. It's a little ambitious to have so many options because there's no way you can master everything.  Our server seemed nice, but the service department was a bit lacking. He never really came back until we flagged him down for another drink and then again for the bill. He never did a quality check on our food. Our dirty plates took a while to be cleared and a manager eventually offered to have them taken out of our way.   Several washroom stalls weren't flushed and full of toilet paper. As someone who used to work at Pickle Barrel years ago, I don't think that our visit was up to the chain's standards."}
{"text":"i went there once and it sucked, we had 14 people, reserved a table prior and i sampled about 7 dishes and they all sucked, i can cook better, my theory on restaurants is when there are too many items on the menu something is bound to go wrong,the freshness, taste something...anyway, first and last time at the pickle barrel, the people that reviewed this restaurant must have lost there taste buds on the way there or dont know what good food tastes like...."}
{"text":"Very slow service (1:30). Ordered appetizer, never came. Food order took 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches and chicken fingers. AND they were cold when they are supposed to be hot. Won't be coming here again. If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Fine for dinner before a movie, but I have never really beena fan of the roadhouse themes."}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary. I usually get the stir fry meal, i guess it's kinda cool that they make it right in front of you, but, aside from that, the actual taste isn't really that spectacular."}
{"text":"My first Pickle Barrel experience. Would not have been my first choice but friend we were visiting picked here.  About the most remarkable thing about this restaurant was that you take an escalator to get down from it. Very chain like. Could be a Moxies if you were playing pin the tail on the restaurant. Food was unremarkable.   I got the make your own smoked meat sandwich. I expected to be blown away by the portions- I even paid for an extra thick sandwich- and I wasn't. I upgraded and got a dainty looking portion of sweet potato fries on the side. They were the best part of the meal. Our waiter checked on us often. A bit too often actually. I think he was angling for a better tip; looking like he was going out of his way but not really providing     My friend is celiac and the service really fell down for her. She wanted to order a dessert off the \"low gluten\" menu and wanted to know what low gluten versus gluten free was. The server admitted he didn't know. He also didn't offer to go find out. My friend picked something she thought would be safe. When it came it had Oreos and brownies in it. She picked the out but shouldn't have had to. This is just after my celiac friend discussed her disease with the server.   Also, I don't know if someone was having an off day but there was a pretty steady sound of broken crockery coming from the kitchen; probably half a dozen plates or whatever were dropped during our visit. I didn't feel like shouting opa after this mediocre  meal!  It was a three star meal really but due to their insensitivity to a serious gluten sensivity they lose one."}
{"text":"The food experience overall was great, however the staff (both the hostess and the waitress) made the atmosphere feel very hostile. I've been to other locations where the employees have great customer service however the ones here gave me a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place has been around Yonge and Eglinton for a few years now, great location and even though the view of the city has drastically reduced after renovations in 2013 it continues to be a great place to dine in either alone or in a group setting. The menu is extensive and sure to satisfy a wide range of tastes and palates. Service might not always be consistent or the best in town for that matter, but if you able to overlook that you will find out that the food it's always served fresh, hot and yes, delicious. Prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. Having said that, I'll continue to visit this restaurant for a long time to come."}
{"text":"The food is not that great. However, I must say that we enjoined the breakfast a lot.  From the nice server to the general atmosphere and price, it was a great value"}
{"text":"My experience with PB is like a Justin and Selena romance. I'll try you out, leave you and re-kindle our relationship after a year.  On January, 25th 2016, I vowed never to re-visit Pickle Barrel again. This time, it was inevitable. My friend, Ms. S, turned a quarter century and insisted on dining here. I hinted to look elsewhere. I pleaded. I begged. I showed her my last review. But to no avail.   So here's my honest opinion.  The food arrives: Nachos. Mushroom Swiss Burger. A Sapporo. Three food items that should not disappoint. I wish that was true. The PB famous nachos are consistent with what you would imagine. I liked it because the Jalapenos gave kick start to my appetite.   Then comes the burger. I was really confused. Did someone drop the burger? It looked nothing like its picture. Check out my photo and you be the judge. But I'm not here to critique the appearance of a CAD 13.99 burger. I'm here to scrutinize flavours, texture and consistency.   Here's what I liked. Condiments and sauces muddled together in good harmony. Everything \"melted\" well together. The bread was toasted and kept its shape through the 7 minutes it took me to consume its entirety. I appreciate the real cheese they use and not those ones that come in plastic wrap The quantity of meat to everything else was fair.   Here's what I didn't like. The beef patties need a bit more salt. I had to put a conscious effort to make out the beefy notes of the patty. And after I did, I conclude it comprised of low quality beef. It tasted like store bought ground beef and not a blend of Chuck or sirloin. The beef was not succulent. Luckily, the sauce and excess grease disguised the Sahara desert-like beef patties. The burger also needed some tartness to balance out the super savoury sauces. I added ketchup on my own. It blows my mind that ketchup isn't a requirement in restaurant burgers. Acidity is your friend.  Overall, the burger was not bad. I just hold Pickel Barrel to a higher standard. Burgers are not hard to make and I feet like PB dropped the ball on this one. Also, honourable mention to the sides. They were just freaking awesome.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   On another note, I commend Christina, our server. She was spectacular. I have yet to experience better customer service. Friendly, bubbly, and full of warmth. Her ability to connect with everyone is magnificent. She loves what she does and it shows. What truly stood out is she made sure everyone was happy with their experience and took the time to understand everyone. Thank you, Christina!  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   To end my lengthy review, here's my conclusion.   I truly encourage all the execs at CARA to sit down and have a burger at PB. Nonetheless, I wouldn't buy what I wouldn't eat. PB has great potential but lacks the WOW factor for critics like myself. PB is such an iconic brand but will be overshadowed by the big American competitor next door.   For now, I have no intentions to return.   All the Best David L."}
{"text":"Coach decided we should meet the team at a central location for drinks and food. Yonge & Eg was this central location and she picked this place. Besides the company, nothing was good about this visit.  1. The menu was overwhelming, it was a book! It's great to know that they have a large variety of food offerings, but I got tired after page 4.  2. It was understandably busy. It was Saturday evening afterall. There was about 30 minutes between getting our drink orders and food orders. While our food was served, our server was nowhere to be seen and we just ordered more drinks with a random server.  3. The eight of us ordered at the same time, however, my meal took an additional 15 minutes to arrive. It was a chicken sandwich with fries, so I'm not sure why that took so long and I was just sat at the table watching my friends eat.   4. My friend's soup had a hair in it. Maybe it was the kitchen, or the server with squaggly beard and hair. Who knows? They did replace it, so he joined me in watching the rest of our friends eat.  5. Food quality was mediocre. No one at my table thought their food was anything special. You know the feeling you get when stare at other tables being served food? Yeah, you definitely wouldn't get that here.  I'm always around Yonge/Eg and never went to Pickle Barrel until this visit. Now I never will again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here today. My wife's club sandwich was dry but that's not surprising considering it's 75% bread. My cheese burger was overcooked and flavourless and the bun was was too big for the tiny dry meat patty. Our service was awful. No one asked us how our meal was or got us a drink refill. We will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"Really, really, really inconsistent. I live walking distance from here and have been coming to this location for years. I like the post-renovation look, and I like the breadth of the menu. I feel like there are things they do well - eggs, deli sandwiches, stuff like that - and if you stray from that, you're on your own. The quality of staff varies wildly. I've had really helpful, pleasant, amicable waiters and I've had people who bring me dirty napkins with dirty cutlery. During my latest visit, one server, an older Israeli man, actually took my menu out of my hand to show me where something was. I was ordering a specific thing and knew it was on there, but didn't know what page it was on, and he somehow thought this was okay. The food is kinda good, mostly whatever. It's not even your best option in the mall, in my opinion, but it might be better than braving the food court."}
{"text":"I will never get the fascination with this place.   First, the service is consistently terrible. Last time I was there, the host barely said a word and did not even try to crack a light smile while taking us to our table. You're a host. Smiling and being nice is pretty much your only job.  The actual restaurant set-up is absurd. The booths all face outwards. I felt like I was in a play about being in a restaurant booth.  And I am so tired of people excitedly telling me how big their menu is. I know. This is NOT a good thing. No restaurant can support a menu as large and extensive as The Pickle Barrel's. Unless things are pre-made, frozen, etc. This is probably why their food is so bland.  They get 2 stars only because their food is edible. But I would put Pickle Barrel on the level of an East Side Mario's. Every time you come, you ask why you're there but leave only kinda regretting the trip."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, each time it has been with a big group of people and only once have we had a reservation.  Usually we go for office lunches.  They are always friendly and I have no complaints about the food, it's always really good.  The service is a little slow but that could be due to the fact that we usually are there with a a group of 10 people."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the Promenade Pickle Barrel, I normally love going to Pickle Barrel but this location was terrible; the windowed area looks very run down and dirty; the window ledges are disgusting and not cleaned at all, chairs have dirt on them... all things that matter when you are eating somewhere.  The food was also very disappointing, my spinach omelette was literally burnt and looked stale, as if it had been out for hours. The potato latke's were stale and tasted old as well. The breakfast potatoes were also very stale and not crunchy at all. Nothing tasted fresh; my coffee left a weird brown residue on the inside of the mug... again, not fresh clearly. And even for the breakfast Potatoes.. they gave us literally 12 small potatoes on a small plate not even with the meal...   Just generally very unimpressed with this location and the quality of food. Don't think I'll be returning to any location, Aviva Vaughan is an awesome breakfast place as well as What a Bagel; fresh eggs, crispy fried potato wedges and amazing omelettes. The omelette i got at Pickle Barrel Promenade was a complete waste of money, didnt taste the slightest bit fresh or appetizing. Extremely disappointed as my family and I are huge Pickle Barrel Fans... atleast WERE.  I can also see other 2 star reviews of this place over the last couple of months, and managements response, but it doesnt seem as though there have been any improvements."}
{"text":"I came here on a weeknight for dinner with my family. The restaurant was quite quiet. Only 3 other tables with customers from what I could see. 4 staff on the floor.   I was in a rush to be somewhere and warned the server I needed things to come quick. He acknowledged.   We ordered smoothies, a salad, zucchini curd sticks, Spanish paella and fajita. - I may or may not have forgotten something.   The salad, sticks and paella arrives after 45  minutes followed by the smoothies 10 minutes later.   Yes, the drinks came after 50 minutes!!! I asked the server why everything took so long. He tells me that they have updated the menu and chefs are unfamiliar with the menu. Everything I've ordered has been on the menu for months!   I would say that regardless, drinks should be served before my salad and main.   The fajitas took very long to come and was bland. - 1.5 hour wait. The tortillas came in half the amount I usually get.   I always had to wave the staff down when I needed service. It didn't seem like they wanted to serve me.   I asked to speak to the Manager and she apologized for the service, even took the fajita off the bill.   But when I asked for a machine to pay for my bill. She just left the machine and bill on the table for me to punch in my own bill. - There's a first for everything.   Let's just say the service and food quality was disappointing... Especially the service."}
{"text":"Service was inadequate and slow. BBQ chicken was dry and tasteless. I'm from Texas -- I know BBQ and that was awful. \"Mixed vegetables\" was 1/4 of a corn on the cob, half of a bell pepper and three asparagus.  Woopie.....! Didn't get your money's worth. Don't come here, just don't."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE! Ordered a chicken hummus wrap- barely any chicken inside and it was full of tomatoes more then anything! the wrap + the chicken was piss cold! never again!!!!!!! Spoke to the manager and she was NO HELP!"}
{"text":"The final night of my American Friend's stay in Toronto.  I decided to bring them somewhere that fits the following criteria without going too far out of the way as my Friend had an early flight out the next morning and I was doubting my ability to wake up at \"6 AM\" to drive them.  @@  What I do for Friends these days...  Criteria #1 - Near Finch Subway Station Criteria #2 - Canadian Back Bacon Criteria #3 - Montreal Smoked Meat  This Centerpoint Mall fits the bill enough as my Friend is nothing of a Foodie so doesn't require the most authentic of flavours.  Upon arriving to this Pickel Barrel as such it is typical of it's nature being inside a Mall environment.  This one however is full CLEAR glass enclosure which means from the mall path you can see everything inside.  Inside is nothing worth looking at as it was the CLASSIC style decor of a Deli Shop, nothing upscale that others know of from their Yorkdale, Vaughan Mills, Markville Mall locations.  We we greeted somewhat and provided seating at a table that had 3 of 4 chairs and the table slightly GRIMEY.  Fine, it's a Deli Shop not a \"5 star* restaurant so I didn't mind too much.  We weren't told who our server was and no one came by within 10 minutes to greet us.  The server we got DID his job and barely fulfilling his duty for any Tips at all.  We did get our Food and Drinks but nothing even close to being above and beyond as he stared at my EMPTY glass and still says \"What else can I get you?\"   How about the better Waiter that is serving those tables over there?  Famous Deli Sandwich(Montreal Smoked Meat $8.99 - Big One $1.00) -  It's as standard as a Sandwich can get.  Fries and Coleslaw were alright.  Eggs Benedict($9.99) - Latkes were okay.  Canadian Back Bacon were okay.  Hollandaise were okay.  Fresh Fruit looked OLD.  Poached Eggs were OVERCOOKED.  This Pickle Barrel is for the people shopping in this Centerpoint Mall which means demographics of 50 years old or over.  Their requirements for a Meal is much different than people going to other Pickle Barrels.  For the same Menu, Price, I would definitely TRAVEL further for another Pickle Barrel with stylish Environment, better Service and generally not feeling like a Retirement Home."}
{"text":"This restaurant has pretty good food but the service was SO. BAD. We ordered a plate of poutine and they gave us 3 orders of sweet potatoes instead. We also had to ask for the ketchup twice and waited for the bill for over 45 minutes even though we asked several waiters and waitresses several times. They also charged us for the sweet potato fries that we did not order! So we had to wait another 20 minutes for the bill to come back. Wouldn't recommend for someone who doesn't have that much time in their hands. :)"}
{"text":"where do I start? I only came here because I didn't want to wait for the cheesecake factory one day. Theres a reason why theres no line up at all for this place. Our server had forgotten to add in one of our orders and at the end, I asked for a take out cup because I wasn't able to finish the milkshake. He gives a different sized lid for the cup so that it's not even closable. That's besides the point. The food is mediocre. Calamari is basically frozen squid hoops that are deep fried. Onion Soup was far too salty and pastas lacked sauce and flavour. I needed to add a **** load of parmesan cheese to flavour it myself."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hate for this place. Why ? I came here a couple of weeks ago on a Monday night to meet up with a former colleague. The location is great - steps from Eglinton, it's easily accessible by public transport. You can also find a lot of street parking if you do your research and read the signs carefully. It's a newly renovated restaurant (Nov. '13) so the feel of the place is nice and clean. You get a great view of the Yonge-Eglinton intersection if you sit by the windows. Services was excellent; our server came often to check on how we were doing. The food is pretty good - the menu is extensive that there's something for everyone. For the large portions, pricing here is quite reasonable. If I need to meet up with someone at a convenient location, I might decide on this place again.  PS - The chicken hummus wrap was large and yummy.  Good for: groups, drinks, after work"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service...had to wait 10 minutes For someone to come to the front to greet me on a Wednesday night! Only to be offered the worst table in the most crowded section and when I objected, the waitress seemed upset to offer another one... Server wasn't attentive while taking orders....dessert I ordered wasn't available but I wasn't informed until he brought the other dessert orders with two tiramisu shots (instead of the cake which I originally ordered). I felt like being put on the spot! I agreed to the substitute but one of the shots seemed like it was sitting outside the fridge for a while!  In short, won't go back!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Pickle Barrel all the time but haven't been until today for a couple of years. The menu has clearly improved!! It's my first time at this location and I was really impressed at how FAST all our food came. Our waiter was nice and answered all questions concerning the menu we had.   The decor was typical with what you see at all Pickle Barrel locations -- dark colours with dim lighting, and a cash area with desserts nicely displayed.   To eat I got the eggplant parmigiana which was too oily for my liking but the taste was great, and the cesar salad which seemed more like a meal than a side dish (which I can't complain about as I got to take my leftovers home). To drink I got a strawberry martini because it was $6 but it was overly sweet and tasted like a melted version of a daiquiri. I also got a mojito with an extra shot which was average. My boyfriend got the two chicken breasts and veggies off their limited time locally grown farmer menu which was good but he mentioned his meal had a strong cinnamon and sweet taste so it felt more like a dessert.   Overall I enjoyed my time here including the customer service and how fast we got our food and, therefore, would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"My last visit to the pickle barrel was back in 2009 downtown. I didn't enjoy it at all. I actually made a pack with my friend that we wouldn't go back. 5 years later and I'm on my way to pickle barrel with my sister. I ordered the Atlantic salmon. It came w mostly potatoes and some mashed up green beans (I think) and red peppers. They were very soggy and mushy. The potatoes were good though. The salmon itself had this disgusting olive spread on it. At first I thought it was a pesto, I was very wrong. I ended up scrapping it off. I don't find the food well prepared or tasty. My sister got a medium rare steak which came medium. No pink what so ever.  We also got apple cidar beer which had ice in it. Who puts ice in beer?  I got the jumbo skor dessert. That was good but not enough for me to give this place another experience. The service was friendly. Pickle barrel, I am done with you."}
{"text":"I know at least with my friends Pickle Barrel has a bad rap, I'm not sure why. The Pickle Barrel at Yonge & Eg is in a pretty central location, and it's farily big, so it's rare that you'll ever have to wait for a seat for a long time (like a lot of other restaurants in the area).    They have your typical cafe style food, sandwiches, wraps, burgers and the like.  I like the nachos platter, my staple when I go.. Seriously, the best darn nachos I've had.. They put some sort of tomato sauce, so sometimes the \"older\" nachos get soggy, but it's still delish. If you are afraid of the sogginess, then go ask them to go lite on the tomato sauce.  The bruschetta is also one of the best i have, though it can be hard to eat (they cut the pieces in thin triangles). The bread is some kind of garlicky flatbread, absolutely yumster!   I ordered a veggie wrap once, it was pretty good, but nothing compared to the nachos.   I can't attest to any of the other dishes to be honest because I like to stick to my faves! But try em and let me know!"}
{"text":"This Restaurant chain, which started almost 40 years ago, used to be a wonderful place to eat meat sandwiches, go for brunch, and enjoy the amazing food. It has turned into a Sysco systems fiasco. Frozen, already prepared food that is put on your plate. Long gone are the days of true delicatessen food from this place. This is just embarrassing."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. The server was obnoxious, didn't know the menu, couldn't answer a simple question about what comes on the burger....  The lettuce in my salad was wilted and disgusting  The fried pickles were a mess with brown lettuce underneath   The burger was burned, had no sauces and the waitress gave us a disgusting attitude when we asked if they could put sauce on it. It came back with a frikken pesto sauce on the bun...."}
{"text":"Pickle barrel is always a favourite for me. They update their menu with even more variety of foods. Loved it. Spacious so not much wait for a table esp since its at yorkdale so it's probably always packed. Service was good as they kept on asking every once in awhile to check if everything was good. I wouldn't expect that much when it's prime dinner time. Huge portions tho. Tbh, it is like a cheaper version of Joey's."}
{"text":"Packed with old peeps, I felt really odd walking in.  Still decided to check it out since I've heard good things.  The menu features an assortment of choices and it was difficult to decide between the Sundried Tomato Burger or the Fish and Chips.  Asked the waiter which was better and would recommend.  He told me the burger was best in regards to calories.  I didn't quite remember (must be getting senile already in my seat) asking him that in specific but I kinda felt that was rude from a complete stranger.   Regardless, I went with the healthier choice being just over 600 calories!  The Sundried Tomato Burger looked aesthetically pleasing to the eye and featured an array of flavour.  The goat cheese spread balanced out the spice in the burger and the sweetness of the tomato.  Very nice, but I'm not interested in visiting again.  Perhaps when I'm 60?    Each star will represent each element I enjoyed in my meal today.  The iced cappuccino also helped."}
{"text":"This being the second time I've ever visited a Pickle Barrel location, I found the food to be consistent with that of the one I visited before.    Came in for the $19.99 valentine's special and ordered a steak dinner in hopes of trying something new.  Had it prepared medium-rare.  That proved to be the better choice in the end because it allowed the meat to be juicy and tender... Actually unlike any steak I've really ever tried before.  I'm not into beef all that much but this was an exception  I'm glad to have made.     The soup that we opted over the salad was a good choice, but I recall it being some sort of tomato soup that was orange.  Otherwise unmemorable.   The little desserts that came after were so neatly displayed that you really had at least 8 varieties to choose from. It was surprising that I even had room for dessert!    The entire meal was all in all pretty decent although I only visit Pickle Barrel by invite of a friend or boyfriend.  Not exactly somewhere I would by choice make the suggestion to visit."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for dinner after finding out there was not a huge selection of restaurants at YD. The restaurant is bigger then it looks, it is very misleading until you get onto the escalators to go downstairs to the dining area. We were able to beat the dinner crowd and got a table quickly. Our server (Alan, also noted in Alice L.'s review) gave really good service, and made our evening/dinner that much better (very rare nowadays to see people go a bit above and beyond in their job). Our friends ordered appetizers, which looked quite plentiful. We ordered the P.B burger and I ordered the BBQ chicken breast entree. Also we ordered 2 peach bellinis for us girls, and I really liked it (I am a major sucker for sweet drinks so it was easy to like).  Overall, the dinner was good, the service was very good and the meal price was fair. I'd say we would go back, hopefully get the same server. The manager came by to ask us how our meal went which is nice especially in large franchises."}
{"text":"I kind a liked downtown one near eaton centre so I decided to give it a try this location for spicy mussel(it was really good at downtown location).  This is franchise so I was expecting the same taste but I thought it wrong.  Meat ball spaghetti -not enough source.  Asked for rmore and then they brought it after almost half an hour.  Spicy mussel - not spicy just too watery.  Ambience is so much different than the ones I been in to. Should be a 1 star but another star for huge parking spot"}
{"text":"I have visited the Pickle Barrel's various locations over the years, especially the Yonge/Dundas location when I used to work in the area. I was happy when they opened a new location in my neighbourhood (Newmarket). Their vast menu always fascinates me: how do they keep all of that food on hand to make so many different entrees, salads and desserts?  Unfortunately, I have given this restaurant a 3-star rating because their service is almost painfully slow. It shouldn't take 2 hours to have dinner unless you're willing to sit there and gab, or you have a large group. Whether I've been there alone, with a friend, or with my book club, service is so slow that you are all too often trying to track down your server. They are all usually quite nice people but I don't know where they disappear to for fairly long periods of time, especially when the restaurant is not busy (as was the case last night).  The food is usually good, I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner at different locations. If they could do better with their service (i.e. be more attentive), I would certainly rate them higher."}
{"text":"The service was awful. We were only one of two tables. My friend asked for water, and they only brought 1 glass. Then I asked and it took forever to arrive.  We were never greeted. We had to ask for everything... we asked for him to take our order for coffee. Waiter never came back to refill our coffee. We had to hunt him down.  We also had to ask him to take our order. Which he got wrong.  Never checked on us after the food was delivered.... COLD(Yuk to COLD eggs). We had to ask for everything. Worst experience by a waiter... and the award goes to PB team.   Will never return"}
{"text":"Horrible! We've tried this location so many times we've decided to give up!  Food- horrible Menu- too many options (probably why the food is so bad, they just can't figure out what they are doing) Waitstaff- very busy hanging out with each other at the bar.  Atmosphere- dirty and old, omg the bathroom was disgusting   Never again not worth it"}
{"text":"We had three for lunch that day.  Huge menu, large space, easy to get seated, but first got third degreed by the host before we were seated about what brought us to PB.  I guess this is part of their marketing surveys, but we were seated quickly.  Service was ok but waitress seemed less than delighted to be there.  Nevertheless, we ploughed onward.  One of us had a martini and the Harold Cobb Salad - good.  Another had a glass of the house red wine and a Lobster Grilled Cheese sandwich - not really tasty and not much lobster.  Alas, another had a SanteFe Bowl -- wasn't that tasty - actually not good at all with an odd \"tart\" taste.  So total experience -- overall less than inspired and closer to - we won't go there again!"}
{"text":"Mixed review with three visits to this restaurant.  The first two times, the food was great as well as the service.  I usually get the deli meat plate as it's very good here.  The third time I visited, the waitress was not the brightest and kept making mistakes and when I substituted sweet potato fries for regular fries, she didn't bring the coleslaw because substituted. The meat was also not lean as requested. I also had to ask multiple times to get mustard and to no surprise, it was from a cabinet somewhere and I had to open the plastic wrappings myself.  The yonge street location near the eaton centre is better. They are also weird at times where menu items are unavailable but service is still good with seasoned waiters that know the food."}
{"text":"Was good a couple years ago, now the value for money is gone. The quality and amount of food served is pathetic, what once was a 6\" tall sandwich is a 3\" tiny thing and the prices have gone up across the entire menu. What was a thick juicy steak, is thin and helplessly bad. The staff are actually great, it's simply greedy ownership/shareholders trying to squeeze more profit out of every menu item. Want a nice juicy thick steak, go elsewhere. Want a serious meal that will leave you satisfied and looking forward to the next time you can come back, doesn't exist at the pickle barrel... Well, not anymore at least.  I will never go back, ever."}
{"text":"Dear pickle barrel,  Thanks for accommodating us after cheesecake factory rejected us on this bloody cold boxing day. Yorkdale was packed, ugg store had a lineup, ttc was broken down and needed crowd control, the cold was cutting my face, and I seriously bruised my ego and my knee after wiping out on the snowbank - so i was glad to have a warm dinner spot after watching star wars.  The dinner was mediocre, i had the tuna poke bowl. A bit light on the tuna side and heavy on the lettuce. Poke guys downtown was much  better. Hubby got grilled salmon, way  overcooked he says.  The drinks however, generated an interesting discussion with the lovely manager. She tried to hear our concern and provided a tiny bit compensation. The problem is a design issue that corporate office should address. And i get the manager probably feels compelled to defend corporate, maybe.   They sell 22 oz beers on the menu, which we ordered. On the glass it marked a clear 500ml mark near the top, much like your average pint glass. You know the one, solid glass handle, slight room for head. This glass is apparantly what you will get if you want the 22oz beer. 22 oz, as per Google, is 650 and change ml. 500ml with head room is not it. The manager tells me that beer mug is exactly 22oz filled to the rim ( in fact she promised she did the measuring herself in the kitchen with water. ) lol, dont think so. Pictured, volume measured and nope.   Even if it really is true. So i need to accept headless beer filled right up to the rim so that my server wont even be able to walk it to me without spilling.  Dont advertise for 22oz beer when you sell me 16. There is a difference.  Thanks."}
{"text":"The food at Pickle Barrel while not gourmet always seems to be quite good almost no matter what you order. The service here is not bad either and the prices are relatively good."}
{"text":"There is a saying about stepping on the same rake twice. Or about fooling someone twice. I'm guilty of both.   I knew this place is bad, from back in the day, but I've decided that maybe, just maybe, things got better - after all the pretty pictures in the takeout menu and the renovated front / pick up areas look all so attractive.   Truth is - nothing changed - this place is the kingdom of bland, not to mention overly expensive.   Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered togo dinner today and Im giving you guys 1 star due to very simple thing that should have done,no lid on the dipping sauce of my calamari and the sauce spill all over my calamari. Come on why not put Lid!"}
{"text":"Our server was very good. Just for her I'd give this place 4 stars!! However...  The MANAGER here is a racist!!! He went around the tables beside and behind us to ask them how they were but did not even come near our table! All the tables around us were non-Asians!  So for this awful man's prejudices, I give this place 2 stars!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, with a large group, with one other person, for lunch, for dinner etc... Out of all those times, I had one bad experience that comes to mind. That's a great percentage  They have recently (I don't know how recent) revamped their menu. They still have the old favourites and all day breakfast but have added some new items. The menu is vast and goes in many different directions so depending on what you are craving, there's sure to be something for you.  The service as of late has been very good. It seems that with the revamp of their menus, they have also revamped their serving staff. I almost feel as though I'm in a classier restaurant than what my bill informs me of.   The food is good, not great, I feel as though the entire atmosphere is what really gives it the extra stars. But it is one of those classic places that is always reliable for a decent meal for a great price. And a place that serves all day breakfast along with a New York strip is an okay place in my books.  And seriously, what can you ask for in a chain restaurant?"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in pickle barrel now. Food options for vegetarians is small and very bland. Way to over priced."}
{"text":"I got the 2 course early dine (3:00-6:00pm) special. For the starter I got the mixed green salad and for entrée fish tacos. The mixed green salad was enjoyable. The dressing was sweet-sour (just the right amount) complemented by strips of slim apple slices. Sprinkled sunflower seeds was a nice counter balance. The fish taco came  with three piece and the presentation was nice. Close enough to the picture in the menu. This wasn't a warm meal as I pictured it. The fish was soft and maybe too salty after eating a few bites of it. The dips added brighter flavour to a dark tasting dish. I was full in the end but the tacos wasn't anything special. The service today was fairly good. Came at the right times and explained some option.  The newly renovated restaurant had a modern feel and the washroom was pretty and state of the art!"}
{"text":"The service was overall pretty bad. I went out with my family to use up a gift card and when it came to paying the bill, apparently the card couldn't be used because of some damage to the magnetic strip. I find that hard to believe considering this was one of two cards I got from my company just this Christmas (everyone in my company got 2). I had already used one of them just fine and stored both safely. So we had to fully pay for a meal that we wouldn't have bothered to go to if it weren't for this issue. If I didn't have a gift card, I my family wouldn't have even ordered 3 course meals and 2 draft beers either. Nothing could be done on the restaurant level.  The table we got seated at was not level. Generally not good when trying to share food. Sheila, our server after getting our drinks took quite some time to get to our table to order our meals. The waters we got was in different glasses and did not have a lemon as other guests had. One of the beers had been spilled by the server as well. My ginger ale was in a smaller cup than my sisters. Her service seemed really rushed not even listening to our full orders; trying to quickly get away. Always also pushing recommended food without even mentioning extra costs.  All members of my family ordered a three course meal: Panko basa Spanish palla Pan seared salmon Fish and chips.  The starters came in 10 minutes but not at the same time. I noticed that my dad's coleslaw did not come at all and I found out by asking that it was to come with the entre. The thing is that the fish and chip entre already comes with coleslaw. Were they trying to cut costs? We ended up switching to a salad. The daily special beef barley soup was also out of stock so I had to go with chicken noodle soup. I noticed while drinking the soup that there was a hair in it. I did not mention it thinking not to make such a big deal over it. The salad was OK except that the greens looked pretty wilted.  Throughout the service not once did our server check up on us.  Our entres came 15 minutes later and again not at the same time. My dad's fish and chips came with a stray soy bean sprout. I noticed later that my bass came with less topping compared to other people. Our server failed to mention that they were out of mussels for my mom's paella and so instead added more shrimp although did not ask us. The dish only had 4 shrimp and it was swimming in sauce. My sisters salmon was flaky and had a fishy odor. It did not seem very fresh and no roasted potatoes (just 2 boiled ones).  My mom couldn't take eating her dish so we asked to replace it with the salmon my sister had. It was a world of difference compared to what my sister got. It was a bigger cut of salmon  cooked fresh and moist on the inside. The potatoes were still boiled (also 2).  The mini desserts came next. Our server touched the spoon heads before giving them to us which is not good for food handling. My dad and I found some small papery stuff. On the outer glass rim for my dad and a thin shred on the mousse in mine. The brownie was not very good. Not soft sweet and buttery at all.  By the time we finished the dessert, I had to ask the manager for the coffee that still hadn't come yet. The manager told us they would brew a fresh batch. My dad said the coffee seemed really weak.  So then at the end of the meal I find out that my gift card did not work and now, I will have to call the head office to fix the card and do this again another time.  My dad noticed on the way to the bathroom, the kitchen was not very clean ad all. We heard some dishes breaking while eating and it seems they had not cleaned up.  A pretty bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst restaurants , experience, and concept i have ever been to. I was shopping with a friend in the mall about two weeks ago. We were walking back and forth and debating if we should give this one a try and then unfortunately we did. We went downstairs and there was 3 hostesses. They took our name down and asked us to wait for 10-15 mins for a table of TWO. Funny thing is that i was walking around and out of like the 200 seats they had or even way more there was only around 20-25 people. I didnt get why we had tl wait this long. Anyway finally we sat down and ordered our server was professional and nice so far. Food is really average and i would even say slightly under average. Now the worst part when i wanted to pay our server was no where to be found. 5 minutes after i realize that our server and 3 more server are standing and playing with their phones in the small drink station that they have. I literally stood up, waved, whistled , tried to grab their attention in anyway but they were too busy laughing and showing each other videos. I had to wait 17 minutes for me to order my bill and 10 more minutes for him to bring it back so i can take some of the change back as our bill was 60 and i left a 100. So basically my experience at that location was 15 mins wait to get seated, 30 minutes ordered/ate, and 27 minutes to pay. Will not be back."}
{"text":"If you appreciate restaurants with variety, er...an overwhelming selection of food on its menus, this is the place for you!  On my first visit here (and possibly last?), I was ravenous and delighted in page after page of appies, entrees, burgers & sandwiches, seafood and so forth. It's truly American dining at its \"Canadianest\".  Mussels (my first love) are only $7.99 and their beef burger sliders were about the same. Fiance and I started with those -- the sliders were massive. Like, a tiny bit smaller than McD's kid size burgers and there were four of them!  I ordered a veggie burger with a side of yam fries - the server wasn't on top of his game at all that night (or is that typical? I won't comment on that) and thought I ordered the fries as a starter, so out came this plate of pretty looking yam fries. Until I actually ate a few -- they were not fresh, like they'd been sitting for awhile under a hot lamp.  I took one bite of the veggie burger and almost puked -- it reminded me of Chinese herbal medicine. Needless to say, the server took it off the bill (but still charged me for a full appy size yam fries). At that point, I didn't bother to complain anymore.   I guess the only highlights of this dining adventure would be the beer and the dessert. Fiance ordered one of those yard-long beer flasks...I think it was Sapporo and I ordered a brownie dessert that came in a mini-martini glass. We thoroughly enjoyed each.   I really don't think I'll be back. Of course, that won't matter to Pickle Barrel since they probably make a killing from servicing the movie-going crowd."}
{"text":"The hosts seem a little flustered, but I don't really care because they're not the ones serving me. I tend to always get the same server; he's delightful and hilarious.  I went here a couple of weeks ago with my friend after work. We tried the Asian nachos and they were delicious. Beer specials are pretty good too. If I had a bigger budget to work with (I'm a college student), I would definitely dine here more. My only problem with this place is the menu is unnecessarily big, it's very overwhelming. Also, the restaurant itself is like a maze. Just too big, but the space would be great to use as a banquet hall for huge parties."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ever come here.  Oh wait, I work in the mall.  Every few months, I seem to forget all of my bad past experiences and come back.  Just really meh. I suggest another sit down establishment in the mall instead."}
{"text":"So the nachos was very dry & it lacked the chicken I wanted on it, (just few pieces) and the over all service was blah. I will not name or describe the waiter/waitress so they don't get in trouble but I will never revisit pickle barrel again."}
{"text":"I usually hate restaurant chains, but this place is still a favorite of mine to stop in when I visit Toronto.  Big beers! Yes they serve 16, 32 and I believe a 64 ounce beer if my memory serves me.  I started with the four burger sliders appetizers, which is just a great way to kick off a night of devouring fatty foods with booze. They give you the sides to mix and match your burgers to you liking. I also got an order of mozzarella sticks and they were pretty darn good.  I ordered a half bbq chicken that came with fries. Oh Canada your ketchup taste so good...why is that? Oh yeah no HFCS...what a concept. Anyway the chicken was juicy, bbqed to perfection and the fries were addictively (is that a word?) good.  Now this place would have scored easily a 4...maybe 4.5 if yelp offered half star reviews. But the waitress was awful! She came over to our table and took our orders...we sat there noticing a few things...A) No napkins, B) No utensils, C) No condiments. You need at least two of those three items when dining out.  When we brought it to her attention after sitting with greasy hands from eating our appetizers, she immediately threw her co-worker under the bus and said it was her fault that we did not have those items. Hmm? You are the damn waitress...it might be her fault as the host seating us, but it is also yours you silly goose.  Then when we finished our food we had to flag her down after sitting there twiddling our thumbs and staring at the empty glasses that once had soda in them. I do not usually care about waiters and waitresses, I get that they have long hours and it is a thankless job, but seriously she was probably one of the worst I have ever had and it almost ruined a fun night out."}
{"text":"I just want to know how you can go wrong with a simple fish & chips? My fish was not fully cooked, my tartar sauce was just mayo and just overall, the whole time I was thinking how this establishment is still open!? As soon my friend and I were seated, we weren't greeted with a waiter until 20 mins later and he said, \"Oh sorry, I thought you guys were already being served\". The servers were just sitting at the tables chatting away like there isn't anyone to take care of in the restaurant. My friend got a MTL smoked meat sandwich and it was bread, 5 inches of meat and a slice of lettuce. It was disgusting. I could have made 6 other sandwiches with the amount of meat they put in there. Plates were disgusting, glasses were disgusting, employees were disgusting and do not get me started on the washrooms. Disgusting.   Would not recommend to anybody, will not be returning."}
{"text":"4 stars due to bartender,  jazzmin And all bar staff   Quality attentive service given by her  A true pro.   Had the waffle and berries. Not bad at all   Coffee was actually decent too   Will be back"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times either alone or with guests and they consistently perform well.   Servers have a great attitude and bartender Andrew is always at the top of his game.  Most importantly the food here that is served is really excellent and presentation is nice as well.  As an example I had the poached egg breakfast today with side sausages which were quite tasty and served with a salad and toast.  If I had one negative it's that the coffee really isn't that great in my opinion.  Highly recommend. I'm just fussy about my coffee ."}
{"text":"Wouldn't even give 1 star!  Horribly tasting food and really bad service!  The waiter was not bad but he should tell the customer if something we're ordering is going to be too much for a person to eat..  While they server placed the fajitas,  2/4 brocollis fell out.. They forgot the add the 1/3 part of the fajitas - the sweet potato!  The Quinoa Super Bowl was so bad!  Over all horrible experience!  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Ok first off I don't want someone screaming out my name like some uncivilized Neanderthal ..when a table is ready..wait is so long people just walk off & u then have to wait for the people to scream out 20-30 names then u get seated..service is slow, when food comes they dont even know who ordered what, server walked around for like 5 mins with our food..food was ok...the banana milkshake was great..I got the 36oz too bad I'm lactose now & I paid the price of a lifetime from 3am-7am..ain't goin back place is like a high end mcdonalds ..lol not like when I went as a kid and they would place a basket of pickles on the table."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant.  Tonight was our first visit here.  Unfortunately it didn't really deliver in expectations.    The service was quite good.  Very friendly and attentive.    The menu is too big.  Very difficult to read.  So we stuck with the basics.    The food was a disappointment.  My wife's PB burger wasn't even hot.  I couldn't even say it was warm.  But she was too hungry to complain and send it back.  I ordered the chicken burger that had a fancy name but I can't remember what it was.  It was just a soggy coated chicken breast with hot sauce.  There was supposed to be some battered jalapeños and a aioli sauce on it but there wasn't. The chicken burger wasn't very tasty.  I would not recommend it.  The 3 onion rings on top were soaked in oil.  Making the bun very greasy.  Whoever put this plate together needs to be trained better.  It should never have left the kitchen.    Overall, the service made up partially for the poor food.  We probably won't be back until later in the year to give them another chance.  The food just wasn't good.    Do less and make them great.  I don't think the kitchen can handle this menu.    Recommend:  Take your time coming here.  It isn't worth the rush."}
{"text":"Great food and service; I asked to get the lobster jumbo shrimp linguini but substitute for Gnocchi and they did so with an extra $8 charge. I wish the Gnocchi was smaller and had no stuffing inside though, it would have just been perfect. Overall love the restaurant and environment."}
{"text":"Bright, spacious and in a prime location at Yonge Eglinton Centre, this Pickle Barrel location is a good stop for a Saturday night dinner. Meeting with some friends and watching the Leafs at the bar area, we were encouraged to stay until the rest of the game, with no pressure to leave. The service is spot on, attentive but not overbearing, and contributing to an overall good experience.   The food was good, however as you may see from the pictures the shrimp dish was a bit lacking in the presentation and the bun on the turkey burger looked like it was chewed on somewhat when brought to the table, but the flavour was quite good. I had the aforementioned Turkey Burger which was moisy, with a piece of red pepper and cheese. It was a reasonable portion and a good alternative to a beef burger. The paella that a friend got looked quite good but I heard that the flavour did not represent a true paella, where Saffron may not have been used. Without Saffron, they may reconsider calling the dish a Spanish paella is a misnomer. Therefore, in my opinion the food itself rates a 3/5, but note that the 'Brown Cow' cheesecake was excellent and my friend ordered a second slice for the table.   Overall, service and price was very good, just continue to focus on presentation and seasoning."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I begin with this one? The service in every moment during our lunch was non existent or lacking.  We waited for 20 Min for our server to come and take the order.  Food comes out in sheer 'I don't give a shit' fashion in terms of quality and presentation, none of our cutleries are even on the table. Then the server brings cutlery - 1 set.... 'playing the flag down ur server' game again with aggregation..  during our dining, the server never checked up on us once, THEN, while we are still eating, comes and asks to settle the bill bc he's leaving.. nice move.  And we realize the dessert from kids menu didn't come or and again, need to flag down another server to ask for it.  The rating of this resto is already in the toilet and by his single visit, I knew exactly why. Does anyone from mgnt care about this state of affair?  This place is one of THE worst resto in the city in all aspects."}
{"text":"Always go here.... almost always hit up the breakfast portion of the very large, very broad menu. And pair my steak and eggs with a half-yard of Stella Artrois for sum yummy goodness. Always good service, prices aren't like CHEAP but definately fair. And last time I went for an app and a pint (or 2) I had the crispy barrel potatoes, and the bacon chive aioli was soooo darm good. I'm a big fan of this chain and this location in particular. Try it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Never again. Menu is way too big (to be fair at least they do have vegetarian options), but the food is so bland. Tastes like a bad at-home-meal. Service is also slow and there's usually a wait too...don't really see why.   The layout of the restaurant is interesting, but kind of confusing....feels a bit like a maze.   Food from their take out section is just as bad too. Baked goods are dry and just plain icky."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have visited a Pickle Barrel--what a change!  The new location in Newmarket ON looks like it has cloned the feel of a Cheesecake Factory.  Nice decor, a thick paged book for a menu, complete with advertising and stunning photography.  And the menu was no longer the classic home style food of the old Pickle Barrel.  I remember their Belgian waffles from years ago--yum.  I had the Rose Reisman inspired Paella because the picture looked very tasty.  The presentation was good on all the plates at my group's table.  Unfortunately the paella was a 3 dressed up as a 9.  I could not figure out why the plate was screaming hot, but the food was cold.  I bit into a piece of chicken so cold that felt like it was partially thawed.  For $17 the dish contained 3 medium shrimp and 4 tiny mussels.  The flavor was surprisingly bland.   The desert sampler was six mini martini glasses filled with a variety of deserts for $11.  All of them were very good, but the Tiramisu was the best of the lot and the only item I had that was worthy of my expectations.  This was my second attempt at the new Pickle Barrel in Newmarket.  I went the prior Saturday morning for breakfast.  The picture of the Eggs Florentine was enticing, so I asked if they made their hollandaise sauce from scratch.  I discovered they make it from a powder.  I skipped the Eggs Benedict and went for the safety of eggs over easy with bacon and multigrain toast.  The eggs came out undercooked.  Powdered hollandaise, possibly frozen ingredients and pale flavors--try this restaurant once for the experience, but I doubt you will be able to rationalize the price with the result.  I wish there was a Cheesecake Factory closer than Buffalo NY..."}
{"text":"Great spot for a birthday dinner. All good was great and the the service quite pleasant.  (Blue cheese steak is worth returning for)"}
{"text":"Mmm mm mm! I don't get to eat at the Pickle Barrel often anymore but when I do, it's always great!  This location is in the basement of Yorkdale and when we used to live in the area, we came here more often.  We were here one night after work doing a little shopping in our old stomping ground and decided to treat ourselves.   My husband went for the Rubin and I opted for the Cali Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich with the most delicious Carrot Ginger soup. Oh. My. God. The soup. So good and with just the right about of bite from the ginger.   Both of our sandwiches were fabulous and very satisfying.   The service was great and our meal came in a reasonable amount of time considering we were there right a peak dinner time.   I'm only knocking then down a star because the table we were first sat at was really dirty and sticky even though it had been wiped down. After we were moved, everything was spot on.   Side note: I recently found out that a Pickle Barrel is opening up close to me!! Yay!! Hold tight for that review!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my boyfriend today for my birthday on June 12. At first glance, the place seemed very nice and we got seated fairly quickly!   I ended up getting the steak with fries and a mojito it tasted pretty good although I found the portions for the fries wasn't very uneven with the steak the steak was a little bit too small in my opinion but nevertheless it was pretty good regardless of the size! My boyfriend ended up getting shrimp pasta and he said it tasted pretty good as well!   Both of the meals come with a caesar salad as well which also tasted pretty good although the sprinkled a little bit too much to cheese on my salad!  The service here was pretty good even though I was a little bit sceptical about some of the reviews prior to going to this place today honestly I didn't find the service to slow and I thought our waitress was pretty good my boyfriend even gave her $20 tip!   I will definitely come back with some friends or my boyfriend again!"}
{"text":"Wide menu selection but the food is average.  The service we had was below standard, but this was due to the servers tenure.  She was in training.  Overall, I feel the place under spiced and over priced."}
{"text":"Was at this location Sumday Sept 25th, 2016 (5:00pm) Food was wonderful but the service was absolutely horrible. Took 20min for our witress to come to our table and when she did it was like we where inconveniencing her, she dropped off our appetizers and didn't take our dinner order, waited 25 min for her to come back completely ignored us the whole time. Caller the manager over and she was even rudder then the witress as I'm telling her about all this all she can do is make up excuses for the witress. We didn't get an apology or anything from the manager or the witress. Never have I had such horrible service at this location.. I definitely will be contacting there head office and reporting this manager and witress"}
{"text":"Thanks to the long line for cheesecake factory, people resort to coming here. If i had known the quality of the food, I'd definitely stay away from here (or maybe this location). I ordered the gnocci and was quite disappointed.  It's a very westernized style and it tasted like raw flour filled with cheese.  My family ordered the fish and chips and other deep fried fish dishes and they looked awful. The basa fish was mainly batter and it was not deep fried enough. It was super saucy and the brown rice was so dry.  The onion rings were the worse. They used a beer batter and it resulted in a soggy and burnt dish. Sorry, this experience was not good at all - the prices are super expensive for the kind of food they have here.  Customer service is good though."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner. Nothing special. Not the cleanest place. Food was okay. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel befuddles me! Over the years I've eaten here a handful of time, never having had a negative experience, but it's never something that pops into my head when trying to figure out where I want to go to eat. The menu is vast covering pretty much everything you could want. And all of it is done reasonably well. Marketing perhaps?"}
{"text":"Menu was rather long in my opinion but service can be a little slow when they are way to busy.   Ordered a super food salad and was impressed on portion size and how good the food tasted.   The chicken and waffles was good other than it was a bit high on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Great service good food reasonably priced! Four of us were there for dinner, Leanna and Vishal served us. There was a good atmosphere! Will definitely visit again! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Realistically the management of this place needs to have a better handle on their employees. Tonight the server we had must have been either brand new or just plain lazy. Not until we asked for the table to be cleared was it, there was dirty plates and cups piling up. I actually had to start stacking them up to make room for or main course. The cutlery was, in my opinion deplorable, they all looked to be dirty but upon a more thorough inspection it was just heavily water marked. The food at best is mediocre, however, it was the best part of the evening. Being there for a birthday party you would assume a dessert on the house would be in order yet nothing was provided. I'm not saying its necessary but some acknowledgment would have been respectful. Finally, the server was anything but hygienic, the odor emitting from her was repulsive, I lost my appetite."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pickle Barrel and the service was awful. The server came to our table after 15 minutes of waiting, though the restaurant was not busy. So we put our order for drinks and food at the same time. The food was served after waiting another 20 minutes and drinks came even 5 minutes after that! The server never apologized for delay or never asked if everything was ok. We had ordered Kali Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Maple Nut Salmon; and beer (Stella) for drink, no fancy cocktail that may take forever to make. The food was ok, nothing great. We will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place but it disappoints every time. The food is poor quality. I've been here several times and continue to be unimpressed. The kids like it - that's why I keep coming back - but I'd rather punch myself in the face than come back here again. Small portions. Crappy quality to the food. Service is terrible and slow. Always feel like we are bothering them. Our waiter actually complained that he wasn't supposed to be working today and was upset that he was. Awesome!  There are lots of decent options in aurora and Newmarket. You don't need this one."}
{"text":"3.85 / 5  overall  consolidating all my tips into one review for the heck of it: the do's: -Try the jolly rancher martini if u like sweet fruity drinks.  -sit at the bar and you can usually meet some fun or at least interesting people :) -big TV screen at the bar is great to watch the games.  always a nice lively crowd for Toronto matches!! -Jessica the beautiful and fun bartenderess, the big screen TV and the vibes are the main reasons I come here. then drinks,  then food. all in that order. food is usually great -fried chicken and jalapeño corn waffles with maple syrup was out of this world.  this is a #yolo combination.  yup I just made that up.  so go get your #yolo on -candy apple martini... my guilty pleasure.  -if you're wondering if you should indulge in those take-home sweets,  I recommend the red velvet cake.  I'd love to try the pumpkin spice cheesecake if they have any left next time -go for the fettuccine seafood style or shrimp and lobster  the dont's:  -sangrias (unless they updated cocktail since Dec 2014), fish tacos, Turkey rigatoni (it's OK,  pasta was overcooked), and anything that possibly looks \"too good to be true\" lol (e. g.  ordering a curry bowl of some sort in a North American Chain restaurant is just risky business... but then again, #yolo)"}
{"text":"Used to come here before a movie at the Silvercity. It's been decent each time I've been here. Nothing special. Just your regular Pickle Barrel food. Pastas, burgers, sandwiches, fajita's. They pretty much serve every american type food that you'd want to eat here. Very large serving sizes and plenty of items on their menu. The service isn't bad considering that they've been packed every single time I've been here. Did get a shake here one time and the banana's in it tasted like they were not yet ripe. The deserts are also enormous."}
{"text":"Went here for our team's Christmas lunch.  This particular location in Newmarket is fairly large and nice.  A slightly upscale-ish look to it.  The menu is fairly extensive so if you can't find something here to eat, well then you have issues!  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  I've tried this at Harlem restaurant so I was curious how PB would stack up.  I loved their waffles - they have jalapenos in their batter which gives the waffles a nice kick to them.  They are light and fluffy and all things that waffles should be.  They could give you one more waffles since the fried chicken to waffle ratio could use some tweaking.  I prefer the friend chicken at Harlem though.  At PB, while the inside of the chicken is surprisingly moist, the outside is a bit too charred for my liking.  It doesn't remind me a of the typical fried chicken.    The service is good, but since we came at lunch time it wasn't particularly busy so I would expect it to be good.  We were here last year as well, and one order was slighly screwed up (we pre-order to have more time to eat and relax).  They fixed it immediately by bringing the correct side right away.  So that was nice - no arguing,no extra cost (although I wouldn't expect there to be, but sometimes you never know)  Not the best food ever, but it's good for a large team since there are lots of coices, vegetarian and vegan choices as well."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and the options are not great for me here. I know the burgers can be 'switched' to a veggie patty, and there are salads, but the menu is not vegetarian friendly...So I ordered the potato barrels to begin with, being careful to let the server know to make a note to not add bacon bits. That is all I ordered, because it arrived burnt and really, really greasy looking- not appetizing to look at or eat. So, I lost my appetite for anything else. My negative experience also had a lot to do with the server. I did not feel as if he cared too much about customer service, he did not ask me if I would like to order anything else, and when I asked for my bill he gave me attitude. I usually tip when I go anywhere, and I left one when I felt he did not deserve it, but it was not the normal amount I would tip someone in a service oriented industry. If you like Pickle Barrel, but prefer good customer service (and food that's not over-cooked) with your meal, then do yourself a favor and go to the Yonge Street location. The location at Yorkdale has an unnecessary pretentious atmosphere, but maybe that was just the server that particular day. Burnt food should never be served in a restaurant, especially a chain that should provide consistency at all of their locations. I will not be visiting there again. Moxy's is around the corner. Better atmosphere, friendlier staff, and more variety of great foods (with vegetarian options). There are many other places in and around Yorkdale that provide great food and service in a nicer environment."}
{"text":"Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner we have tried it all. My boyfriend and I are regulars. Service is great (Ask for Scott, he is one of the best servers they have. He's knowledgeable, friendly and efficient) I've never been disappointed with their food quality save for one time and they did not hesitate to take it off my bill, the waitress was very kind and helped me choose another item that morning which was quickly brought out. I enjoy their extensive drink menu, we normally get a bottle of malbec with our red meat oriented meals, but end happily with one of their delicious mixed drinks. They have daily drink specials as well, which offers you a chance to try their more popular drinks at a reasonable price.  I am enjoying their current tiki taco and drinks (worth paying extra to keep the cute glasses if you collect such things).  For an appetizer I suggest the Asian Nachos or the calamari. My staple meal tends to be the PB house burger, meatloaf, the steak or steak sandwich. I can safely say the steak sandwich is addictive, as it comes cover in mushrooms and sautéed onions. We don't generally have room for dessert, but I have had the lava cake and it's very good, there is also a lovely pumpkin spice cheesecake for a lighter fare.  In all, I have always had a pleasant experience at the Pickle Barrel and it has become my go too place when we head too the mall."}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch here. The Mediterranean Burger was very delicious. So was the cabbage borscht soup I ordered on the side. Would deff come back here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had to walk out of the place.   Came in for a nice meal with family so we could discuss life among ourselves. Within 5 minutes of being seated, the TV set volume was substantially increased making it a distraction. After a request from the waiter and then discussion with the manager, it turns out that not only is Pickle Barrel a restaurant, but is now a sports bar. It is corporate policy. If I wanted to eat at a sports bar, I would went to one.   I am a long time customer of the restaurant and have used their catering services for several large events. But now the relationship is broken, likely for good."}
{"text":"OY VEY!!   Pickle Barrel for what it is is fine.  You will never get a meal that is to die for here.   If you order correctly, you will survive the awful service.  Yes the service is awful, it always was and will always be.  You don't go here for the service.  You go here for the wide variety of food.  Gotta love how all the Kvetchers gives this place a 1 star.  Did you really expect better?   Everyone that gave this place 1 star knows nothing better but to Kvetch.  And you keep going back.  Let me tell you what happens to Kvetching customers in the kitchen.  Your food gets tampered with.  You think the servers don't recognize you on your return visit without tipping or causing a scene?  Enjoy the extra \"flavoring\" in your food on your return visits.  Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"I've been to 3 locations - this one, Dundas Square and Yonge and Eglinton. The decor and atmosphere here is a little lagging compared to the other two - it's more of a buffet/diner feel as opposed to a restauranty ambiance you get downtown.   Now to the most important part: THE CALAMARI. I write in my tip that I try to get fried calamari every place I go, in search of the best ones. This place is definitely in the top 3!!!! So crispy, big portion, chipotle dip (not spicy though) - if you're a seafood fan this is a must try.  I got the grilled cheese with bacon, fries and coleslaw (I'm broke ok?!?!). I'm a fan of grilled cheese and bacon so it was good enough for me. It's a double stack so 2 layers of cheese and bacon and 3 pieces of break. Fried and crispy, it was pretty good as far as basics go.   My friend got the burger, it was pretty big and looked super juicy. He didn't want to share :(   The service was great, our server was nice and helpful.   They have a lot of healthy options and a lot of delicious looking dishes too, like the paella (even though if you're going to get paella - go to a legit Spanish restaurant).  All in all a good experience, our bill came to around $45 for both.   There's parking outside the mall, all around.   TIP: stop by T&T - they might have free samples! Or just look around, T&T is always exciting, so much interesting food (like dried squid...drooool)  xoxo"}
{"text":"After sifting through the book-like menu I ordered the \"Best Ever\" Meatloaf.  The gravy is an odd mix of salt, sugar and a dash of beef flavor sort of like the flavour of those fries and gravy chips you sometimes see.  If I were lost in the woods for days before coming by this place, I'd probably just eat one of the servers.  The service was quick."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel has chosen a prime spot in Yonge & Eglinton. On more than one occasion I have gone there with friends because we were at a loss to where to go!  But the analysis paralysis does not end with choosing a restaurant. Once you open PB's menu, there is too much choice. Too many dishes!  This time, we went for breakfast and I ordered the multi-grain French toast with berries. It was delicious and filling. The food is inoffensive. It satisfies a the everyday palate."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of atmosphere but an extensive menu of food and drinks. I enjoyed my matzo ball soup and berry salad for lunch. Friendly and helpful waitress."}
{"text":"Called them from Detroit a month in advance to make a reservation for a party of 10 for Sunday brunch. Arrived early and checked in with hostess. The rudeness from the get-go was jaw-dropping! While acknowledging our reservation, we were told \"We have nothing available and have no idea how long it will be.\" It went downhill from there. We were seated more than an hour after our reserved time. The service was abysmal at best. The food was mediocre and cold. Some of us were almost finished before others got their food.  While the manager offered 2 free appetizers in view of our wait, it was almost an hour after we were seated before that arrived... are you getting the picture? We had to repeatedly request coffee warmups. I could go on and on...suffice it to say, it's a good thing our focus was the reunion with our Toronto friends. We plan regular such get togethers, but they won't be at Pickle Barrel. What a total and profound disappointment! Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Went to pickle barrel tonight, the appetizers were pretty good, but over priced. I had a barrel cut steak which wasn't very good, it came with veggies and asparagus which weren't good at all, and a scoop of mashed potatoes that was just mashed boiled potatoes- no spice. All in all I wasn't very satisfied with the meal and the service was so slow. I get that it's busy, but it wasn't THAT busy. Maybe I'll try again another time, but not for a while..."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd bad experience. Once before the renovation last year and again this Jan 2 2015. Staff were eating food from heat lamp stations and one of the cooks was walking the kitchen with with food hanging from his mouth while handling food. My wife had stomach cramps from the salad. Serious contamination issues with their food preparation."}
{"text":"I guess those reviews with only one or two stars might be some exceptional cases of disappointment.  I have not been to this location for decade until today around late afternoon to meet with my ex-colleague.  The restaurant was pretty empty.  We chose a table beside the window in the sun room to enjoy some sun under the shelter.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  We ordered a triple smoothy each of our choice with strawberries, banana and pineapples.  $3.99 for a smoothy made with fresh fruit and 100% real juice is a fair price in a restaurant with service.  The poutine; however, is the worst one I have ever had.  I prefer my poutine with cheese curds.  The tables and seatings are comfortable, the place is spacious, a bright sun room area, and big portion of food with fair prices are possible reasons this restaurant stays!"}
{"text":"Food is edible. Some dishes are a miss, others a hit. The problem with this place is with the management. Service is slow and awkward, and management need to treat their female colleagues respectively.  Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss with this place when it comes to service. Do not come here when you have \"hanger\" aka angry hunger because you will be waiting forever for a waiter/waitress to take your order. The last time I went, the waiter was so bad that I had to call the hostess to give us another waiter. He gave us menus and everytime we tried to get his attention to take our orders, we would walk away and serve another table. Im not exaggerating but for 30 minutes we sat there with just water and our menus. Thankfully the new waiter was 100 times better. The food was just okay. Youre better off going to other restaurants or fast food places in the area."}
{"text":"Just to put things in perspective, I came here to the pickle barrel and ordered off their \"all day breakfast\" menu... It can't be bad right??  I mean I love breakfast, and brunch.  You can't screw up right?  WRONG.  I ordered a eggs benedict (because I figured I'd add to my eggs benedict list: http://www.yelp.com/list/the-best-eggs-benedicts-ever-gatineau-2).  They did have other stuff on the menu, but I figured that the pickle barrel wouldn't do that bad of a job.  It came out and the eggs looked like they were \"poached\" with a egg mcmuffin tool (it was perfectly round, not the good way).  It sat on a slice of canadian ham (cause it looked like Schneiders ham) that was as dry as the desert.  Served next to that was a bunch of potatoes.  So... biting in I don't think i've ever had a worse eggs Benedict.  Dry, bland and entirely too runny.  So bland I don't even think salt would have fixed it.  It tasted like I was eating liquified paper on a crunchy (and stale) english muffin.  Wow... maybe it's cause it wasn't breakfast.  Then again, don't call your menu \"all day breakfast\" when you can't deliver \"all day\"."}
{"text":"Met some friends at the Yonge & Eglinton location for dinner & drinks last weekend. First of all, this place is huge! Secondly, so is their menu! It took me a while to decide what to eat, but I finally went with the trout special from their summer menu, along with a Caesar (Sunday Special!) to drink.   The trout was amazing. Not only did it look good, but it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I loved the salad that came with it, too. Nothing boring about this dish, that's for sure.   I hope to go back very soon to try some more of their great food."}
{"text":"Greasy, burned food. One morsel tasted like it had mold. Had to wait a long time for a coffee refill. The waitress was very polite, but I asked for a quiet place in the corner somewhere so that I can read and was placed right near the kitchen, which was noisy and strange in an almost completely empty restaurant. I wouldn't reccomend it."}
{"text":"Just ate here with a good sized group of people - about 15 of us. There was only one waitress and often with a group that size, they put on 2 but she was as fast as she could be. The food came out of the kitchen at the same time and I didn't hear that anyone was dissatisfied with their meal."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, its nothing special. They have a lot of comfort food I would say, nothing out of the ordinary. Check this place out for sure, but if you want something unique, this is not the place for you, I mean nothing here stands out, its your everyday same ol' Canadian food I would call it. I would definitely eat here again though, just not as often as I would another place, also the price is kind of pricey."}
{"text":"A standard chain restaurant with a big selection for food and drinks. Consistent quality you can depend on. Maybe a little lacking in flavor intensity. My Thai Red Curry Rice Bowl was not spicy at all although it was listed as a spicy dish.   Service was efficient and friendly. Portion was satisfying and price was reasonable. This location has expanded and there was plenty of seating available. We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table on a Friday with no reservation."}
{"text":"I grew up with Pickle Barrel (the original location on Leslie) so it pains me to say this, but the food at the Yonge & Eg location is just crap. And I base that opinion not on one meal, but on several meals. I live and work at Yonge & Eg so I've had occasion to eat here over the years, mostly out of convenience.  My most recent meal was delivery...I got a menu in the mail announcing that Pickle Barrel would start home delivery, and being a delivery fan, I decided to give'r a try.  Not good. The stir fries were meh. The deli sandwich was just bad. The lettuce on the lettuce wraps was soaking wet. The fries were bleh.  This is consistent with my dine-in experience at Pickle Barrel Yonge & Eg, both pre- and post-renovations.  Attention PB Yonge & Eg, it's time to step up your game!!"}
{"text":"Pickle barrel is always my top choice when I'm hungry but don't know what to eat. Their extensive menu offers so much variety to choose from often times I'm actually torn between choices. However, the problem with extensive menu items is that it seems like everything is mediocre, not too shabby but not out of this world as well. Wouldn't be my date night choice of restaurant, but a good place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Always a good time. Great food and very friendly staff! Doesn't deserve 2.5 stars, if you're looking for some wholesome food it's always the right choice!"}
{"text":"30 mins to get water and coffee. Not even tap water for 30 mins. Coffee came cold. Sent back coffees and still waited another 15+mins... Service was painfully slow. Waiter forgot what we ordered about to set down items from other table's order. Kids menu comes w side - my boys chose fruit as side.  Side for fruit came w one slice of melon although picture on menu shows berries n more. Asked waiter about getting berries n pineapple and he said that that'd be a fruit cup order to get w berries. I showed him menu pic of the kids side dish order and after more back and forth he finally gave my son berries. It's literally in the menu picture. How can he dispute that?! We ordered 2 salads that came w half ingredients listed on menu, missing veggies, or brown rice or quinoa. Salads came w no dressing! Avocado had a hair on it! Gross. Had to chase down waiter to let him know about no dressing n salad. Staff seem good at avoiding tables and eye contact when they knew tables in solarium area were feeling neglected. Still waited for coffee. Got up to speak w manager bc couldn't wait longer re concerns. she said she knows it's an issue w food and service and she's been trying to 'tell customers to contact the head office w complaints'. Then she tried to rectify it but by then meal experience was sunk. Awful experience, nothing was done right from get go."}
{"text":"The entire place got a whole new revamp of its decor and layout. It's now a nice bottom floor restaurant that boasts a bountiful bar. We order the P.B. Famous Nachos as an appetizer, and it was absolutely huge. The sour cream and salsa were in huge portion laid out on top. The nachos themselves were cheesy and crispy, with lots of onion and tomato. Definitely recommend it for a party of 3 or more. As for the main course, I had the Shiite mushroom and chicken pasta, served with a side of Cesar salad. The salad was huge, it could've been a meal on its own. The salad is served with many crispy croutons and your own Parmesan shaker, but they could've been more generous with the Cesar sauce. The pasta itself was delicious; very light white wine cream sauce, grilled chicken, onion, peppers, and various other vegetables prepared deliciously. Very satisfying. My boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich, and although the size was definitely impressing, it was too dry and the bread was too thick. The fries he chose as a side were thick and fresh. The service was great, our orders were quick to arrive, though my salad appeared before our nacho appetizers. It took them a while to get our bill for a reason. The washrooms were exceptionally clean, and  overall I'm very satisfied with my visit."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3 star restaurant. Ill even go as high as 3.2** Come on guys, it's not gourmet but it's certainly NOT a 1 star dive. This place is usually quite busy and full of younger people. In fact, when I'm here to catch a flick next door at the silver city you can usually find me here. The prices are reasonable for the type of food offered.  Appetizers run from $5-10 and entrees are in the $10-15 but can go as high as $20+ for some of the steak and seafood dishes. I've always been here on casual terms, and service is good. I tend to stick to they're cheaper options because I find they are worth the money, though peope do tend to order the pasta dishes quite often. The Greek feta burger is a standout for me, as well I enjoy the Luau chicken salad...I'll even admit to liking their all day breakfast options at the front of the menu including steak and eggs. Overall, you can't really go wrong here but don't expect to have a life changing meal or anything."}
{"text":"sat in the bar for expediency.. not so much. finally bartender came to take my simple order of beer and fries to go.. beer while I wait obvi. Just took forever for something ao simple."}
{"text":"So so restaurant. Slow service tho. Food is not bad after all, but not as good as the other Pickle Barrel locations"}
{"text":"There's no place like Pickle barrel after watching a great movie!! Ambience is casual, very well-lit area. Friendly staff. We just ordered a late night dessert-frozen vanilla yogurt and a giant banana split. We loved it!!! The price is just right!! Cheaper than what it looks like.."}
{"text":"Greasy fish and chips.  Cold steak on the Caesar.  Probably not made fresh to order. In attentive service.  Horrible experience.  But the kids pasta got a thumbs up from my kid."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of this place. It's located one floor below the rest of the mall meaning no natural light.  The menu is big and has lots of options but there's never been anything on their which would be classified as 'crave worthy'. The salads are filling, the ingredients are fresh, they include healthy options whenever possible. But everything I've ever had is forgettable.  On top of that the place is loud and cramped and despite friendly service, doesn't identify as the type of place where you sit and mingle.  Don't get me wrong, it's not that I hate the place. It's clean and the servers are friendly. It's just not the type of place where I refuse to go.  Thankfully, Yorkdale has plenty of other options."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here with a group of friends for a christmas get to together.  As soon as I looked at the huge menu I was immediately skeptical about the quality. We ordered the fish tacos since I love these things and she wanted to try them.  The fish was really soggy and grease poured out when I squeezed it.  We sent it back and enjoyed a glass of water while everyone else ate around us. The waiter seemed indifferent that we didn't like it,  offer us an alternative which we didn't take, and left.  No apologies or free dessert.  I didn't realize until after we after that others didn't enjoy their food either.  The red curry and a peanut sauce dish were not the best either.  I should have checked yelp and saw this is a 2.5/5 rated restaurant.  The menu is expensive but it's actually quite nice inside the restaurant. It's a pig wearing lipstick as far as I'm concerned.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Burgers were kind of bland but the sweet potato fries were really good."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a bite before a movie, or even after. The restaurant is quite massive...did not expect to see that many tables. A wide selection of comfort foods did please me. I opted for the meatloaf which wasn't spectacular, but still quite satisfying. Could have done with a bit more pepper or even hot sauce to add to the flavour. I would chalk this up as a place to go if you don't care too much about having a dining experience, but rather a \"I gotta eat so why not\" venue."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I've ever experienced.  So much so that I'm typing this review mid-dinner.  Service from the start has been bad.  Only received 1 menu between 2 people took forever for drinks and the waitress to take our order.  (I don't blame her though... she was overworked and the other waiters looked like they didn't know what they were doing.)  Ordered poutine as appetizer, fried were so tough to chew that it seemed they were fried twice.  They also forgot the bacon  chive alioli.  The cobb salad was missing the dressing.  Chicken ripped when it should diced.  Overdry chicken.  Asked the waiter for dressing and he never came back.  At least the seafood trio was good that it saved the dinner from being a total disaster.  I would seriously avoid this location.  In fact, this location could have ruined Pickle Barrel for me.  PS. We talked to the manager and he took off the poutine and salad and offered us a dessert.  That did made up for the dinner and we appreciated the manager's consideration."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the new Pickle Barrel in Pickering, very close to home. The crowds were a turn off when they just opened but tonight didn't seem too busy.  I was seated quickly once I got inside. Nice looking place with a high ceiling, a few booths, a good mix of seating.  I perused their vast menu for a while before deciding on the Rueben Burger, one of their features. It has two patties, pastrami, cheese, and sauerkraut. I got a Caesar salad as my side.  The Caesar salad was good, not overdressed. The burger was pretty tall and I had to squash it a bit to fit my mouth. Unfortunately, that first bite was a mouthful of bitterness. The underside of the bun was burnt. Charred. I picked off some of the burnt bits but ended up eating it with a knife and fork. That spoiled it for me.  My server was very efficient and fast but also very annoying. I didn't appreciate being referred to as \"Boss\", as in \"How's it goin', Boss?\" or \"here you go, Boss.\" or \"Need anything else, Boss?\" It wasn't very professional.  Growing pains? Maybe. I'll have to wait and see if I get the urge to give them another try."}
{"text":"location location location.   Is there any other reason this place still exists?  I've been dragged here too many times in my life. I would rather eat fast food. I think that says enough.  I remember being moderately satisfied by their milkshake. Otherwise they're like 0 for 12 on meal attempts."}
{"text":"Great spot for all day breakfast. 9/10 times the chef is on point.  Theres buttons at the table so you can buzz the waiter when you're ready.  I love that its male servers and female hostesses - works very well. All staff is super friendly. The bathrooms are clean and well renovated. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and comfy booths.  The burgers are good and so are the sandwiches.  No complaints here :)"}
{"text":"I came here last night with a few of  my girl friends to catch up. I was a little disappointed by the service that we had. First off, our waiter took forever to come take our order. My friend had ordered the fettuccine and she didn't get her starter Caesar salad until much later.  I had ordered myself the fish tacos, and I can't say anything bad about it -- it was good. I think it was just the service that we had was a bit slow for a place like this."}
{"text":"My first time at Pickle Barrel, I went with a group of 7 at dinner. The place seems pretty big but it took awhile for us to be seated. It didn't seem busy so??? But anyways, I ordered the gnocchi dish and it wasn't amazing. It started off good but by the end, I didn't want the few pieces that were left. The spinach is weird in the dish because it's soggy. Our server was nice at first but gradually became more and more rushed (maybe he was near the end of his shift?). We ordered asian nachos and calamari as apps and I wasn't a fan of the nachos as they have a weird taste. The menu is so expansive, I definitely want to go back to try the other dishes and hopefully have a better experience."}
{"text":"This location used to be one of my go-to spot with my friends. Over the years, the quality of the service and/or food has declined. Today, the service was fine, our server, Renae was attentive and tried really hard. The food was a huge missed. My lettuce wraps, well, the lettuce came with dirt all over and it's noticeable, I don't know how the busser missed this. I was told the manager would come speak to me, but never did. My server quickly took my plate and swapped it out, I could see the disappointment in her face when I informed her about the lettuce problem, it was totally not her fault though. The chicken was over cooked, it was pretty dry. My boyfriend got the BBLT, it was good, the bacon was really salty for my liking. The aioli was on point for the fries."}
{"text":"This place had a long wait time. It is definitely not worth it. We were seated at a booth. Our server was very well attentive and friendly. She met our needs. Coincidently; she walked by as I noticed a hair in my food, as I was pulling it out, she quickly came over and took my food away. Called for a management, discounted my meal; offer me something new or if I wanted anything else. It was an unfortunate event. The food satisfied the hunger but nothing stood out. Probably not returning again, the food quality has gone downhill. Joey's the place to go."}
{"text":"I like to try every Pickle Barrel in the city. Good food for a reasonable price. Infact, I find it a bit more upscale in terms of seating and selections compared to Jack Astors, East Side Mario's and the likes. But very similar in price. My boyfriend thinks the same way so it's never a quabble to go to Pickle Barrel.   My boyfriend almost always ends up getting the steak, ribs or something meaty. And will usually think it's \"moderate\". But I am a Meatloaf fan. And I've said this in every Pickle Barrel review. I don't think I've ever ordered anything but that amazing meatloaf (with extra sauce) for just an unbeatable $12.99.   Things I liked about this location in partciular:   1. Cozy basement seating - not as creepy as it sounds. But you walk down a level below Yorkdale Mall's ground floor to the restaurant. It's so classy and nice! And absolutely beautiful interiors.  2. Our server was a sweetheart.  3. Holy Washrooms! Wave your hand, and that door will open for you!  Ankie Tip: Order a martini cocktail instead of a regular one if you really want to feel the alcohol guzzle. The regular cocktails go down like fruit juice. For $7, you might as well pay for a little buzz. I highly recommend the Blue Bayou... which is what I got."}
{"text":"Well this was a disappointment!   More like \"Ickle\" Barrel than Pickle Barrel!  We have had some good evening and lunch meals in the past at this location. We really enjoyed when Rose Reisman re-did the menu. Those days are gone! On this occasion we went for brunch/breakfast before a movie matinee.  We both ordered the standard breakfast (3 eggs with very crispy bacon).  We had a choice of potatoes or latkes (we both ordered latkes) and toast.  Frankly - it was awful -- I can say without a doubt that it was the worst restaurant breakfast I have ever had in all my 15 years in Toronto.  I ordered tea - and they brought me a pot of hot water.  When i went to put the tea bag in, there were paper strips from some other food floating in it. I told the waitress and she replaced it and apologized (but yuk!!) I wonder if she even brought a new pot.  Goodness knows where that stuff came from.  Then the meal came - what a disappointment - 3 eggs swimming in water -- odd for over easy (utterly tasteless and undercooked -- the white was still runny).  I got 2 small rashers of bacon barely cooked, and two latkes.  No sour cream or applesauce for the latkes (does anyone else think this is odd?)  The latkes were actually the only decent thing on the menu.  My husband made out better than me -- he actually got 4 rashers of bacon - although not crispy.    The waitress was careful not to ask if we enjoyed our food -- it had to be obvious we were not thrilled, and lots of food left on plates - but that was even worse in some ways -- she didn't even care enough to ask -- so the servers don't care and the restaurant doesn't care that you are satisfied!  The bill came to over $27.  For this!!!???  - We will not be back. Shame on you Pickle Barrel!!!  I have had $5.99 breakfasts that were tastier and no issues on cleanliness and quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is an all-around good deal, with lots of choices, and lots of seating.  It's good for big groups and small.  Our group last week was 5, and we got a nice quiet round booth in the back.  It's a very good value for what you get.  If you have a large group with many different palette preperences...there's always something for everyone.  And since the price is very VERY reasonable, with big portions, every comes out of there satisfied, and without breaking the bank.  Service may be a bit lacking, but they really are just \"servers\" there.  I don't think they are really trained to help \"Make the experience\".  So if it's a special occasion for 2...don't expect the waiter to help with that.  I had the double burger...yes, the DOUBLE burger.  It's not on the menu, but for an extra $3, they will give you another pattie.  That was a great value.  Their bugers are thick and juicy...and taste 100% like beef, unlike some that are mostly filler.  I would recommend this place for any group outing!  NOTE: they don't take reservations for groups less than 8."}
{"text":"I was really unhappy with my recent experience at Pickle Barrel. It was my first time at the Newmarket location and I was left very disappointed. We came on a busy day for lunch and we were seated at a table with almost no space between us and the next table. This made it impossible to have a private conversation and made us very uncomfortable. Apparently there were no other tables available. The table was also right beside a busy walkway which was not preferable. So right away the seating was not a great start. Our waitress - let's call her Judy - was trying her best to be friendly and patient despite the busy lunch hour but it was clear her patience was wearing thin and she was rushed. We ordered our meals and when they finally arrived, they did not come how we had asked. My friend had requested no tomatoes on her sandwich and I received the wrong dressing. The service was taking longer than expected so we decided to eat what we were given and get on with our day. My friend had her 6 month old baby with her at our table who had woken up and was becoming very vocal so we requested the bill and got ready to leave. We were ready to pay with credit card when Judy informed us the system was down and they could only take payments in cash. We had no cash and a fussy baby. What were we to do? Judy came and went a few times trying to figure out what to do. She was told to take all our information - including credit card information - and we would have to come back once everything was up and running again. Really, Judy? It was hard to believe that this was the solution they had come up with for the \"pickle\" that they were in. We refused and were becoming increasingly frustrated with their insistence on this resolution to the problem. Just as we were about to speak to the manager (who still had not come by our table to address this), the system began working again and we were able to pay our bill. That is the last time I will see the inside of that restaurant as they have lost my business. Not only was this situation handled poorly, the food was nothing to speak of. We left this very long and extremely unsatisfying lunch with a bad taste in our mouth. I will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I must say, myself and my girlfriend were lucky. We got in to this place before the lunch rush hour started. Our seats were great and the service was prompt. The decor was nice and the ambience made the area for a nice conversation.  The price was average, but the food was cooked to perfection. The calamari was amazing to start. It had the perfect crunch and the sauce was a great complimentary flavor. My girlfriend got her favorite BLT bacon sandwich and it was juicy, flavorful and presented really well. Myself, I got the PB blue burger with fries. It was delicious cooked perfectly and was very filling.   Our server always made sure we had everything we required ie; water and napkins.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone. I've had a great experience and would like to try their chicken and waffles next time I go."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a minus star I would. What kind of chef put this garbage menu together. Ordered the \"marinated for 24 hour\" chicken strips which literally had no taste. My sister had the nachos with \"seasoned beef\" which was literally a cut up hamburger patty. The calamari was the only half decent thing I ordered. My mom had the heaven bbq and the ribs had a weird taste   All in all the best thing on the table was the pickle that came on top of that gross side of coleslaw....and I hate pickles. I literally hate myself for wasting my money"}
{"text":"There are few chain restaurants as hit and miss as Pickle Barrel. The food can be either surprisingly passable or abjectly disgusting, with little consistency between visits.  I live in the area, so I've been to this particular Pickle Barrel many, many times. (It's a fast, relatively affordable option.) It was the last trip about a week ago that prompted me to write this review, as I was quite pleasantly impressed by how much I enjoyed my meal.  The restaurant offers a two course dinner for $9.99 before 6:00, so that was exactly what I took advantage of on my most recent trip. I opted to start with the Matzo Ball Soup, a dish I had inexplicably never tried before.  I have to imagine this is an incredibly weak version of this Jewish staple, but I nevertheless liked it well enough to finish my bowl. The broth was a pretty generic chicken noodle soup type of thing, while the matzo itself, which was enormous, was tasty if entirely bland.  My main course was the Spaghetti & Meatballs (zesty tomato meat sauce  and giant home-made meatballs). It'd be easy to expect a tasteless, Ragu-type sauce with chewy meatballs, but I'll admit this dish is actually pretty decent. The zesty sauce and fairly-close-to-al-dente pasta elevate it above what one might expect, to be sure.  (And god bless the daily drink specials!)"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for somewhat healthy and an average price for maybe a lunch date with few friends or your husband etc. I would recommend this location, for appetizer I got the lobster and artichoke dip with tortillas. It was the bomb! So delicious. I just started going to pickle barrel at many locations but I really like this one and the Vaughan mills location also."}
{"text":"Complete rip off. Paid a premium of 20.99 for lobster and jumbo shrimp linguine and what I got is nowhere near the price I paid for. Got couple bits and pieces of lobster like a dog chewed on it. Jumbo shrimps were just regular sized shrimp. The server was great tho but doesn't make up for the bad food."}
{"text":"Terrible experience this morning at Pickle Barrel Yonge-Eglinton. I ordered the smashed avocado toast, and the server asked if I wanted Latkes or home fries, so I replied latkes. When the plate came, there were no latkes, so I called her over asking where they were. She said she forgot to tell me, but the dish didn't actually come with latkes. This wasn't a big deal, as my main concern was there was no avocado on my avocado toast!! The server said it was underneath the tomato, so as I peeled it up, I saw the TINIEST piece of avocado under there, not smashed and spread across the toast as it was supposed to be, but just a tiny insignificant piece hiding under there (see image). The whole thing tasted awful anyway, had like a vinegary taste which was so gross. Needless to say, worst $15 I've ever spent.... will not be back."}
{"text":"The Good: service, menu options, healthy menu, delish salads, all day breakfast, waffles, waffles with chicken, waffles with cheese, waffles. I love waffles!!!!!!  The Not so good: The food. It tastes ok when you dine in but maybe the ambience and company makes everything taste better? I dunno but I do know that the take out and delivery can taste pretty iffy.... except the salads. Those always taste good."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Pickle Barrel this weekend with a group of friends.  I called ahead to ensure the restaurant is open (as the mall is undergoing huge renovations).  The person who answered confirmed they are open.  I had a lovely conversation with this person (I wish I had caught her name) and I made a reservation for 5:00 pm for 8 people.  She even asked if there would be any kids in the party and if we needed a highchair or booster seat.  We ended our conversation with her reading back to me my name, phone number and a confirmation of the time/details of our booking.  Sounds good, right? I let our friends know we had a reservation.    We arrived at the restaurant at 5:00 pm and it was pretty busy.  The girls at the front desk did not have our reservation.  I'm sorry to be so blunt, but these 2 girls are totally spaced out and awful hostesses.  Nevermind that the reception desk itself is high in height (therefore ridiculous for average height women to conduct a conversation over), the music/tvs are blaring so impossible to hear each other and the desk is cluttered with all sorts of crap (menus, specials, signs?) blocking your attempt at a conversation with the hostesses.  We finally got seated and it turned out our friends were already there.  They had the same run-around at the reception desk.  Not a good start.  Dinner itself was pretty good.  Our party had a variety of dishes from burgers (they were ok, nothing to rave about) to pasta and everyone liked their food.  Decent size portions too.  The kids menu is awesome with lots of choices.  We sat in a window overlooking Yonge Street so that was pretty nice.  Our waiter was pretty good too. I used the ladies washroom and by the looks of it, it had not been attended to all afternoon.  There was toilet paper and crayons (?) all over the floor in one of the stalls. The soap dispenser on 1 out of 3 sinks was empty.  And the garbage bin was overflowing onto the floor.  Overall, not a great experience.  Not horrible, but we definitely will not be returning.  I learned one lesson though - always catch the name of the person who takes your reservation.  Luckily, we were seated even though it was quite busy but if that had not been the case, I would have been massively peeved and probably would have left.  I've never really been in love with Pickle Barrel and every time I end up there (usually because friends pick to go there & I think I should give it another shot), I remember why I don't love it."}
{"text":"Made a plan for a Sunday morning breakfast here. I love the ambience and decor of the place each time I step in. Barely any customers so got a preferred table right away.   The pros: The regular bacon strips  and multigrain bread. Delicious. Looked quite appetizing as well which is always nice. Fresh fruit! Even though they could've cut  better. Fair price for the food. Great selection of options.   The cons; The eggs, bleh. No option for anything inside the eggs, no veggies nothing. Just plain scrambled eggs ( done with a bunch of oil so it doesn't stick.. I could tell). The potato barrels were crap. Overdone, un appealing. My partner had eggs benidict,..it was like warm but tasty  But the biggest con was the slow inattentive service. My coffee got cold waiting for the milk. One poor server running around trying to get everyone's order. Felt bad for him. Had that not been there I would've given 3 stars but poor service is one of my biggest pet peeves in a restaurant. Even getting the bill took 10 min.  Overall might visit again, but not for breakfast at least. Cora's and Denny's still rule those two."}
{"text":"I've always loved this restaurant but I have to say that this location has turned me off to this place.   They brought me a poutine with no gravy, just a couple cheese curds tossed on some fries. The chef, and waitress failed to notice this?   Service was lagging considerably. Barely saw my waitress at all. I had to get up and get my own cutlery, and waitress never came around for me to get a drink after I was eating.   I'm disappointed in this location. You guys have great potential, please take the opportunity to do better"}
{"text":"After experiencing PB at Yorkdale and Yonge and Dundas, my friends and I decided to check out the newest location.  We didn't receive the best service. I'm assuming the staff was new and inexperienced. The server messed up our drink order and never checked up on us after we received the food.   The final straw was after our plates were taken away, it took forever to receive the bill."}
{"text":"Service is okay but food is just terrible.  Crispy calamari $10.99 - yes its deep fried but it was just filled with so much oil that it felt like I drank a cup of oil  Hot BBQ beef brisket $10.99 - the beef was dry and the sandwich was suppose to come with BBQ sauce. There was no evidence of sauce being placed in my sandwich. $2.99 extra to add yam fries. The fries were good.  Fried chicken and waffle $16.99 - chicken was dry and would much rather have KFC chicken.  For the price I was really expecting much more. Its one of the rare occassions that I could not finish my meal. The food looks good in appearance but looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Service was great - was seated immediately on a Saturday night for a table of four. Our server, Alan, was very professional/courteous, and was very pleasant to deal with (give him a raise!!). The manager also dropped by to let us know we can approach her if we needed anything. I love it when managers introduce themselves and actually go onto the floor to help their staff! Not giving a five star rating as the food was good, but not amazing. Had the chicken quesadilla (app), mussels (app), and a peach bellini. All were good.  Would recommend going here if you're hungry and passing by (we went shopping at Yorkdale then for a movie) - great for convenience, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied. The following are from my experiences  Service:   1) We waited 30 min for our first appetizers to come. 2 minutes later we get the mains.  2) There is a good 10-15 minute wait for the servers to bring things we request. Eg. an extra plate, a refill on drinks, or even forks which were not given in the beginning. 3) Understaffed, our waitress was literally running around everywhere! The absurdly high prices for food should be able to compensate for more staff!  Food: Starters: $13 each We got the nachos and wings to start. Nachos were delicious. Wings were DRY and overcooked.  Such a shame to mess up a dish as simple as wings.. Mains: $20-$25 Manhattan Steak: Asked for medium, but got a brown eraser instead. The meat was so dry and overcooked! The manager kindly agreed and took it off the bill.  Fish: Not fresh, but tasted good Dessert: Excellent   To conclude: I think the average person can be able to cook a meal better than any of the mains! For that reason, dont come here for the food! Come for the ambiance, drinks and desserts! Subpar experience. Very expensive. Not worth your time and money."}
{"text":"I was in the GTA, visiting family and friends for a couple of days and my sis and friend were all about going to \"The Pickle Barrel.\" Apparently, what 20-year olds want, 20-year olds get.  Our two families, 8 people, all headed out to there to the Bramalea location. We were seated promptly and then forgotten equally promptly. It took our server, Nina, several minutes to get to us and then several more to get us water. Two of us who didn't want ice in their water had to wait close to 40 minutes for their tepid H2O.  It wasn't that busy either dudes. I don't know what the hell was taking this chica so freaking long.  Then we ordered the hummus (meh) and the calamari (yay) for appetizers. The squid came within 10 or 15 minutes but it took a couple of inquiries before the hummus made it out to the table. The special drinks of the day were Bellinis and please, allow me to ask Signor Bellini for his forgiveness now on behalf of The Pickle Barrel because what the eff was that shit that they passed off as a Bellini, I don't know... It was this blended wanna-be-a-margarita-but-ain't-got-'nuff-attitude fail of a whale.   Everyone at the table ordered different things and I would say that: 2/8 raved about our meal, 1/8 wished she'd ordered something else, 3/8 were happy about their food, and the last 2/8 wished their food had been cooked to their specifications (egg white omelette, not whole egg and crispy fish for fish 'n' chips not some soggy p.o.s.)  The shiitake gnocchi were so freakin' good that I have visions of gnocchi dancing in my head. The lobster and jumbo shrimp pasta was seriously muy delicioso (and I don't bust out my rudimentary Spanish skills on just ANY occasion!)  So, with the exception of those two amazing dishes on that EXTENSIVE menu, I'd say go somewhere else where you can get better service and good food for a better price- Jack Astors, maybe?"}
{"text":"So this PB I come to often coz I know a server that works there that i like to use when I'm there but it seems every time I go there and have another server it's kinda terrible..   I was there saturday night after 9:30pm with a party of 9 to celebrate something.. 6 of us got there first, our drinks were taken 10 mins after we sat down, which I found was kinda long for drink rounds (I work in the food industry and have been for 14 years).. We had ordered 5 apps but put a hold on them till the remaining of the party came, server said it would come out fast, so we said that was fine.. The 5 apps we ordered were Asian nachos, regular nachos, 2 deep fried pickles and coconut shrimp..   When the remainder of the party came they ordered their drinks and we ask for the apps to come out now.. The apps came out but half of them were almost warm or cold, which was disappointing, fried items looked as if they were left down too long then they should've been..  During apps we went ahead and ordered our main entrees.. I had seen that they had a new menu so I ordered the fried chicken and waffles, another person had ordered a burger, another chicken fingers, another steak, another steak Diane and the remaining 4 had ordered fish and chips..   Second rounds of drinks took forever to come out (from the time we ordered it, it took anywhere between 5-7mins).. So we decided to order the third round of drinks as the second was hitting the table..   Our food all came out except my food.. Which is understandable but what boggles my mind is why the server would said that I had ordered the French onion soup as well and had said that I said that I ordered it.. Everyone at the table can confirm my order, which I'm pretty sure I know I didn't  order the French onion soup and I would never order it, I'm lactose intolerant.. I finally get my food, fried chicken was dark then I wanted to be and the waffles could've be done a little longer.. Some of the party didn't want to start cause there wasn't any ketchup offered.. I took upon myself to find the first server I can find to ask for it.. They give us 2 almost empty bottles of ketchup.. By now I'm pretty annoyed about the service we were receiving considering it wasn't busy.. No vinegar offered for the 4 that were eating fish and chips.. No water offered to the table.. Did I mention I help clear the table as well? I'm speechless at this point..   Overall I think this experience has really turned me off about this location.. I try to give it chance after chance but every time it seems to disappoints me more and more.. I'm over it.."}
{"text":"Price: Medium price range. ($11-13 for a burger).  Taste: I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Bliss burger with a side of mixed green salad. The meat tasted like cardboard and it was very dry. The salad had too much salad dressing. I was surprised that they poured the balsamic dressing onto my salad (not mixing it) as opposed to having it on the side like other restaurants.   Atmosphere: The decoration was nice and the place had a relaxing atmosphere. It was clean overall.  Service: Great service. The waitress and manager checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything.   Overall: Unless they improve on the quality of the dishes, we are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Not the best Pickle Barrel location...  Working in a restaurant myself, I'm pretty lenient on mistakes being made on the job as I can understand where restaurant staff are coming from. But when these mistakes are being made over and over and over again, that's when it becomes a problem. Common problems that I face at this Pickle Barrel location are: - long wait times for appetizers and entrees to come out - really hard to find server sometimes - twice my appetizer came out after my entree - forgetting salads (they comped dessert for me) - unenthusiastic hostesses - burnt take out sandwiches  Those things aside, food is great. My favourite things on the menu are the deep fried calamari and the iced cafe mocha. Sooooo good. As well, the restaurant is quite large so wait times are basically non-existent. Atmosphere is great too.   So yah, I give this Pickle Barrel 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Very fast service. Great margaritas and food came fast and hot. The deep fried pickles were delicious and the Mac and cheese poppers are amazing! Ill definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Food was good. Good portions. The server gave me two sides to compensate the one I ordered being brought out late ! Yay!!!! Server was awesome, such a nice guy.   The elderly couple next to me weren't pleased with anything.  I felt so bad for server, the hostess, and manager. They made the hostess clean the table and chairs for like 5 minutes straight......the place was spotless to be honest. The server was getting yelled at because they didn't like the food. They asked to see the manager.  The elderly lady put the piece of bread in the managers hand lol i dont know why. I guess it was hard.  The manager resolved the issue and brought them a free appetizer but the old man got mad and shook his head. Then they started telling the manager that this had been the worst pickle barrel they'd been to.  Ugh so annoying to be hearing that next to you, your whole dinner. As for the elderly couple...I think they should stick to good old home cooking since they'd make perfect meals lol."}
{"text":"I really do not like to give these kinds of reviews but perhaps it will help them do better. I ate lunch at the Pickle Barrel today with my mom and my husband. The waitress was very nice and the restaurant itself is aesthetically pleasing. The food on the other hand...well...just not good. First, I ordered a Cosmopolitan and it was among the worst I have ever had. It had a cherry in it! Who does that?! Please don't ever do that again. I ordered the rueben sandwich and it was just okay (couldn't taste the sauerkraut), I've made better fries at home. My husband and my mom had the club sandwich and it came on a hamburger bun and was tasteless. My husband said he had better at a cafeteria.  I've been to the Pickle Barrel once before (this same location) and had only appetizers and thought it was pretty good. It was the reason I came back.   I won't be back to give this another chance."}
{"text":"enjoyed our Sunday afternoon visit here! was fairly empty that day....clean dining area & chic decor. Extensive menu so the choices are endless....and easy for everyone to find something they would like. Good for a casual dining experience:-)   Great matcha green tea/acai berry smoothie, coconut shrimp, steak sandwich & risotto rice balls! The grilled cheese with lobster - not likely to have it again (what lobster??) bc it was rather dry, like it was missing something in its toppings...ordered a bit of BBQ sauce on the side for dipping to help with that!! The food was served rather quickly & was good quality, well worth the money.  Our server was friendly & helpful. Will be back to this location for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the first and last visit to this restaurant. We ordered the lamb steaks. Meal was so so. we both left lots of food on the plate. We had the butternut squash soup and the waiter brought the main course before we had finished it. Not good. Will never go back. A total waste of money."}
{"text":"2 stars because the friend pickles were good. The rest of the meal...not so much. The Ruben was greasy, the lobster grilled cheese was dry and the fries were floppy and under seasoned. It should have been a tip off when the menu was the size of a dictionary. When you try to have 200 items on your menu, the quality is bound to suffer. Definitely won't be returning"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. But this location is really lacking.  I came on a weekday late afternoon for the early dinner 2 dishes for $10 deal. The place was pretty empty so I was expecting speedy service. I got the Caesar salad and the spaghetti and meatball as I was craving pasta. After 10 minutes, my server finally showed up, took my order, and disappeared. Another 10 minutes later she appeared again, took my drink order and disappeared again. The salad came first. That was pretty standard but something I can make at home - nothing fancy. Then the pasta came. The spaghetti came on a big plate with loads of pasta, watery tomato sauce, and two giant meatballs. The meatballs were actually pretty good but the sauce was so watery and tasteless it totally ruined it. It just screams to me: \"here's your cheap food, we don't care in the kitchen\" I wonder if the pasta would come out differently if I had ordered from their regular menu? Disappointing to say the least. Then I waited another 10 minutes sitting around looking for my server after I was finished before she appeared again.My drink was $12 - more expensive than my actual dinner. After tax and tips my dinner came out to $30. Totally not worth it for slow service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Spiced rum daiquiri is amazing. So was the famous deli. Sooo good. Lived the chipotle sauce and sweet potato fries as well. Service was excellent and food tasty. Very reasonable prices and big portions. Love it!"}
{"text":"TIME WARP! While other PB has been renovated in the past few years, this one is still intact, with the whole place looking like it's a diner from the 80s (ok maybe 90s). Sorry I am just not used to it.  However, the menu is the same, with a few pages that cater more to the clientele of that area (matzo balls, anyone?)   The food was ok, not extremely impressive, just like any other PB. I had a luau chicken salad and shared a bruschetta.   The burschetta had some toasted baguette bread around the plate, and then the topping was in the middle. Still delicious, but I wished it was already stacked. Oh and I don't think I saw any Parmesan, just Feta? ... ...  The viaigrette for the salad was too citrusy, but otherwise fine, expected PB quality."}
{"text":"Horrific.  I've never ever not finished what's been served to me.  Streak ended.  Do not get the fish tacos here.  Like highline fish sticks dipped in batter on a bed of bagged salad on a cellophane-grade tortilla.  Impossibly terrible.  The absolute worst meal I've ever been served at a paid restaurant.   I suppose that's worthy of some sort of award.  Or at least a free embroidered vomit bag.  The waiter was great.  That's the one saving grace.  Otherwise I would have been telephoning Yelp HQ trying to figure a way to give them a zero ranking.  Yes.  It's that bad.  I can only imagine that elderly people flock here to hasten their inevitable demise.  Euthanasia via portion control.   The single worst place on earth I have ever eaten at.  Repent.  The end is near."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for delivery (I ended up ordering from somewhere else in the meantime as I assumed my food wasn't coming)  When it finally did show up the delivery guy was rude and not only was the food ice cold (obviously) but it wasn't what I ordered... Even the drinks were wrong - I think someone stapled the order to the wrong bag or something. Regardless it was a terrible experience. Especially when I'm only a block away.  If I wasn't babysitting a newborn I would have walked over and gotten it myself and/or brought it back over to ask what the hell happened."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, I instantly regret my decision. They manage to screw up the simplest of orders. The latest being my wife ordering a sandwich with a soup as her side. The waiter brought it on the same plate and spilled all the liquid on the sandwich making it soggy and gross. I ordered an eggs Benedict and I ordered the eggs medium-soft. They came so well done, that they were practically chicken!!  I don't understand how this franchise is still in business. The food was a lot better when it tried to mirror itself as a Jewish style deli. Just give up!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with some work colleagues.  This location is in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre so it's conveniently located; there is heaps of parking and it's also right by the subway. This particular Pickle Barrel is under construction so the aesthetics of this place is a little rough. Both the food and service is a-okay. Pricing here is pretty reasonable; most entrees are under $20.  I don't know when I'll be back as my experience here was a-ok.  Good for: big groups, casual dining"}
{"text":"Hostess seemed to hate her job and took exceptionally long time to seat us in an empty restaurant. Lots of tables left uncleared. Location seems new with lots of large screened televisions to watch the game. One note to make was this is the brightest/most lit Pickle Barrel I've been to. Usually P.B has a dim, low-light ambience to it, but this location was relatively smaller and more open.   Also there seemed to be one waiter servicing the whole restaurant that night, however he was very friendly to us nonetheless.  Food was mediocre especially for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed by Pickle Barrel several times, particularly at the downtown location near the Eaton Centre.  I came here with a group of about 10 or so, and thought I'd give the Fish and Chips a try again as it was a different location.  The atmosphere was dim, large, and modern. The service was slow. We were in a hurry to catch a comedy show near by and it took us a while to find our waiter to get change.  Unfortunately, the fish looked slightly burned, the batter was tough and not crispy; therefore, I was left quite disappointed. The best thing about the dish were the sweet potato fries and the tartar sauce. My friend ordered the same thing and his experience was similar. My partner ordered the chicken and waffles and it was mediocre. I tried a bit of it, and it was incredibly sweet as if they poured too much maple syrup on top.  Pickle Barrel has failed me again. There are so many better options in the Yonge/Eg area."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service, there is nothing left to say except find somewhere else to eat, and don't waste your money on this place !"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here. I ordered the Barrel Cut steak which tasted like it had just been fished out from the bottom of their freezer and thawed in a microwave before being slapped onto the plate. The fries and veggies that came with it were bland. Everything tasted frozen.   I ended up sending everything back."}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant in one sentence: I expected food like The Works and got something closer to McDonald's.  Between my mother, my two sisters and I, we ordered the Rue'Ben (two orders), the Big Horn and the P.B. House burgers. The first two are part of their \"Notorious Six\" menu. We also ordered a side of onion rings and deep fried dills. It total we spent $100.  This is not the worst food I've ever had but the photos and boasting \"baddest burgers in town\" were nothing close to what we ate. Despite the fancy names of the burger toppings, which made it seem like each burger was significantly different from the other (like at The Works), the food was very bland and unappealing. The fries were terrible, worse than the cheap oven fries you buy at the grocery store. The fried dills were actually good and the best food item. The onion rings were better than the fries but they didn't really stand out.  I can't really speak on the customer service because we ordered this as take out but the person who placed my order on the phone was very friendly. So was the person who processed and handed me my order at the Pickering location.   Three stars probably seems too high but this isn't the worst place I've ever been to. Just don't go expecting these amazing burgers. Not worth the $20/burger. I would not buy any burgers from this place but I might go again and get something else, if someone paid for me. I'll be sticking to The Works from now on - fantastic burgers, bottomless fries & better prices."}
{"text":"Had a work event here. Never again. Servers not very friendly. Dropped two plates spilt drinks on customers. Food very late. Too bad because looks nice with a great patio."}
{"text":"I've been to pickle barrel many times. It was my go to chain restaurant (moxies, Kelsey, Casey's...). I feel like that is no longer the case. I was here for dinner with a party of 6.  After we got there it took at least 20 mins for someone to come and take drink orders.  We had enough time to figure out what we were having. We also noticed the tables weren't properly wiped down. When they brought us the drinks one of the glasses was dirty. One of my friends said that one of the components of the dish was cold but fully cooked. Which leads more to believe food is not made to order.   I decided to go with the lobster grilled cheese. Fortunately the food didn't take long to arrive. As far as grilled cheeses go it hit the mark. They used a whole grain bread (scored some healthy points) and it was crispy just the way I like it. There was a fair amount of cheese although I don't think there is such a thing as too much cheese. My only wish was that they would have added more lobster. I would have gladly paid more for it too. I also felt like not much effort went into assembly.  The grilled cheese came with sweet potatoes fries (I upgraded) and a coleslaw topped with a slice of pickle. The sweet potato fries weren't anything special. It was to soggy for my liking. The coleslaw was pretty good and went well with the sandwich.   Over time this restaurant is getting worse and worse.   They removed the pomegranate milkshake which was favorite. Their attention to detail is non existent. I guess you get what you pay for. Next time I'm in yorkdale I would rather go to joeys or milestones."}
{"text":"Just wow! The worst service i ever had in a restaurant. We got the food after 1:30 hours, taste awful and received the wrong foods.   The manager and waitresses were so impolite and inexperienced that I do not how they do even work here.   What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Ordered a lobster jumbo shrimp pasta...and there was exactly 2 small pieces of lobster and tons of pasta. Wanted to complain to the manager but I couldn't since it was a corporate lunch. For $20 a pasta, I was expecting a bit more. Server kept messing up our order as well...about three times to be exact. Ordered a cafe mocha in a To go cup, and it was half full. I think this is enough reason to render a 1 star rating..."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Decor is attractive and the service was good. I really enjoyed my super sesame shrimp bowl. It was fresh and very tasty. Loaded with shrimp,edamames,pickled onion,sprouts and more. It was 15.99.  The menu is very large,so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Pickle Barrel was at this location, and it was amazing! Now the quality has slowly diminished. We sat in to eat on Sunday evening.  We ordered: Fish and Chips- a little on the crispy side.  Soy Burger - had a strange after taste Spanish Paella - Used a different rice than before, and the overall dish was sweet.   Not the best experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Pickle Barrel chain because of their great menu selections. There's always something I want to try even though they don't change up their menu that often.  The service is good here (and the other Pickle Barrels I've been to). There was an instance when I ordered some sort of seafood pasta and I took a bite and didn't like it. I'm not sure if the seafood gone bad or I just didn't enjoy the taste. I told the waitress about the situation and I asked if I can get the menu to order something else. I was surprised when the bill came and I only had to pay for the entree I finished.  Give this place a try after you're done shopping at Yorkdale because I think this place is a lot better than the other restaurants in the mall."}
{"text":"I still don't understand why people go to Pickle Barrel.  Don't ever sit beside the kitchen, or else your clothes will reek of meat. After coming here, I had to chuck my sweatshirt into the washing machine because of the stench.  Went with a brie and asparagus Benedict ($9.99) but even they couldn't really get that right. The watermelon that came with it was warm and dried up - my friend, a former chef, asked me if it was pickled, since it was it was actually puckered up! The potatoes were flash-fried, but terribly undercooked. The Hollandaise was mediocre but the brie was low-quality. As well, the asparagus was so dried out that you could actually see that the inside of the spears were cracked.   I would have said something, but didn't want to put up a fuss when I was with a group of friends. It doesn't matter though, I doubt I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"I ordered something from the seasonal menu, pictures attached. The manager came after 10 min, offered me something else, no thank you. My daughter ordered the seafood linguine and the seafood was probably expired because it was extremely stinky. I hope she doesn't get sick. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Such a below average restaurant. Massive menu but nothing is actually good. Only thing I like is that you can always get a table because it's never packed"}
{"text":"Can I please give 0 stars???  I have been here MANY times and usually had a not bad experience but this time was AWFUL AND I WILL NEVER RETURN  I ordered the greek chicken souvlaki which came with a greek salad that had tons of rotten lettuce so I asked for another The next one had the same amount of rotten lettuce and soft veggies It was GROSS And when I asked the waiter to just take it away, she seemed annoyed and angry I'm sorry that I choose to NOT eat your rotten lettuce  They didn't offer to take it off the bill Service was RUDE and each time I come here, the service and quality gets worse and worse  I'd just avoid it!"}
{"text":"Gigantor menu. It took me a long time to go through it, and once I was done, I had to go through it again because I had forgotten everything that I thought looked interesting. This is definitely not a quick in and out experience. The food is mostly tasty. Not too extravagant, but the portions a large. The drinks are very delicious, and also large. The raspberry pinacolada is super awesome. Due to its large size, I went through several brain freezes. And like with any frozen drink, it was worth it. :)"}
{"text":"My wife and our friends have been supporting the Pickle Barrel at Centerpoint for 17 years and over the past two of those years(since the renovation) things have been going downhill. Wait staff are terrific as always. There is a snarky/rude female manager however. Three of us were there this morning and we  were less than impressed. We wanted to order breakfast from the regular menu and were told that we could not because it was a \"Holiday\"! What?? It's Fathers Day, not a Holiday. The plates were old and dingy with wear and so large that the food looked lonely. What is going on in that kitchen? There is no consistency from one visit to the next. The Great Reuben sandwich is far from great. Skimpy on the meat, only a handful of fries, the dill pickle had seen better days and the slaw was tired an limp. Pull up your socks Pickle Barrel. Get that kitchen in order, straighten out your managers attitude and stop trying to force your customers to use a special higher priced menu with some lame invention of a Holiday. It's insulting and a shady way of doing business. I wanted to give a \"no star\" review but your waitstaff deserve credit for having to persevere  such difficult conditions."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service.  I've visited this Pickle Barrel hoping that after many tries their customer service would improve but to my dismay, it hasn't. Regardless where I've been seated (patio, front of restaurant, back of restaurant, bar) the greeting and service has been poor. I've been left waiting about 15-20 minutes before a server arrives, introducing themselves and offering to get a drink. By this time, my friends and I usually order our food right off the hop due to the wait. Food comes out hot and tasty, nothing to complain about there. It's just the waiting at the beginning which really plays a huge part in making me want to return. Due to this same experience time after time, I will no longer be going to this location, period. I was hoping it was a hiccup in opening the business a few years back but the same crappy wait times have continued with no resolve.   Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Went for Sat brunch at Markville location, no line ups but had to wait for table.  Menu choices were all over the place so took longer to order, You can't decide whether to have breakfast, lunch or dinner.  What do you think of a restaurant who serves luke warm calamari and burger and fries?  And could have gotten better quality food at a burger joint.  Mental note to self: go to the food court to have a better dining experience for half the price. And honestly, how good can the service be if they are constantly having to bring stuff back to the kitchen to be reheated!"}
{"text":"I just bought a salad to go from the take out area, and as soon as I got home and opened my salad there was a dead fly in my salad, i will never ever buy or eat at the pickle barrel again. How could a restaurant operate like this and stay open. The was a waste of 7 dollars."}
{"text":"Wonderful fun atmosphere. Many excellent food options, great service and reasonable prices. I've never had to wait more than a few of minutes for a seat."}
{"text":"Stay away... the food was horrible and it was dirty.  The table beside us wasn't cleaned during our entire meal .. my food came cold and my wife who has the exact same had here arrive piping hot.   It didn't look all too sanitary either.  Manager did offer my entree for free when he saw how it arrived .. that was nice .. but the overall experience was extremely poor.  It's like a hospital cafeteria in there."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is okay for 1 thing - breakfast. That is it. Even at that, this isn't my restaurant of choice.   Pickle Barrel does one thing well - they keep the same crappy menu and service pretty uniform amongst its Toronto locations.   I suppose you are wondering why I have such a hate on for Pickle Barrel, but all I can say is I gave them too many chances. I haven't had any memorable meals here. Memorable moments, yes. Like when I asked for no veggies with my steak (while ordering) and the server asked if I would mind just sliding them onto one of my friends' plates once being served, since the chef disliked substitutions. I mean, where the hell am I eating?! I am actually saving them money and plating time by omitting part of my meal - not even asking for a substitute."}
{"text":"We came for a Sunday lunch and despite the busyness we were seated quickly and served promptly. The waitress asked every 5 minutes how we're doing which is a little much but better than being forgotten.  I had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye because, well, it IS the Pickle Barrel... I never like garden salad dressings but this time I loved it!!"}
{"text":"This place is one to avoid. I came here with a small group and I think I waited about 40 minutes for appetizers. It was busy but the staff seems surly and the food is terrible. It feels like a journey back in time to the 1980s. Bathrooms are passable but the menu really does not bear repeating."}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel name has been around for years.. Have been to their Yonge and Dundas location, Yonge and Eg location, Centerpoint location, and been to this Promenade location a few times as well.    For my lunch experience at this particular location yesterday, I would give it a satisfactory review..  Had the pastrami sandwich for lunch.. $12 for sandwich, fries, and coleslaw..  Not a bad price.. Also had a $5 beer special to watch a bit of the Olympics..  Ordered mine on light rye, fatty.. Meat tasted exactly the way it should.. 3.5 stars on the sandwich.. 3 stars for the rest of the meal..  Pickle Barrel being around for many years, I expect the restaurant operations to be well run.. And well staffed.. The waitress and reception score would be on par today with 3 stars.. Just a little bit of a wait as the reception was missing and other staff saw us waiting to be greeted but didn't offer help.  If you're looking for a better Pickle Barrel experience, I would suggest the downtown core location first and then Yonge and Eg location second.  Pickle Barrel in general isn't a bad place for a deli sandwich lunch with drinks licence and waitress service.. Wouldn't mind revisiting here and there for a quick lunch date."}
{"text":"Considering that there was a brekkie special for $4.99, as pictured, it was fine.  Special only ran 'til 10:30am and it consisted of 3 eggs (any way), 2 strips of bacon (no sausage option stated), toast (multigrain, white, dark/white rye), & a coupla slivers of fruit.    The portion wasn't overwhelming.  I'd say just right considering the price!    Coffee was $2.50.  Not sure if they offered refills, but the waiter did ask if we wanted more.  One thing I should mention was that hostess' face (young, Asian) looked like she had just eaten something rotten.  She had an attitude and was unhappy for some reason.  There were a bunch of people waiting to be seated and she eventually arrived and looked extremely displeased/pissed off.  As a patron, this was not the best impression to walk into.  I *may have* decided to order something more $$$, but I was turned off with the reception of the hostess."}
{"text":"Yesterday, we came here for my father's birthday because it's a convenient meeting location since we all live on opposite ends of the city. My husband and I have been to this location several times and also to other PB locations and they have been inconsistent every time.   On the plus side, our visit last night was the best in comparison with our past visits and I admit that out of all the locations I've been to, I like Pickle Barrel Yorkdale the best because they have more seating available and they seem to have a larger menu selection. Here, they have my favorite pasta dish, which is the Mushroom Gnocchi, which the other locations don't seem to have, so every time we're here, I order this dish. Last night, we also ordered the Nachos appetizer, a generous portion that even our family of five could not finish, but it tasted amazing. The Gnocchi was my main course and it comes with a choice of either soup or salad so I opted for the  Caesar Salad, which had shredded cheese and lots of croutons that gave it a good flavor. For dessert, I ordered the peanut butter brownie cheesecake sampler served in a shot glass, a good option when you're full from a big meal and just need a small touch to satisfy your sugar craving.   Another pro for Pickle Barrel is that it's a jack of all trades (although a master of none), perfect for my family who have different food tastes, so whether you're craving Asian, Italian, or all-day breakfast, they'll have a bit of everything.   The service however has been inconsistent every time. Sometimes they are fast and other times, we have waited forever before somebody attends to us. Last night, they were quick to serve our food but we had to request for napkins and cutlery since they forgot to supply it for our table. Waiting for the bill at the end took a while too but I acknowledge that our waiter was cheerful and nice whenever we requested anything from him.   Pricing is a little high for the quality of food you get but I guess they charge so much because their portions are so large.   Overall, I would come back here for any group excursions and if I want to have two meals for the price of one (i.e. whatever I don't finish at the restaurant, I take home and have it for lunch the next day)."}
{"text":"I have been to a few branches, this is my 2nd time here.     Ordered my usual Maple Nut salmon and my friend had the  Teriyaki Salmon. We both agreed that the presentation is nicer than the other branches we frequent. It also feels like the serving size is a bit larger or maybe the presentation gave that illusion.   Service was good. Place is clean. Washrooms are smaller than the Leslie finch branch and is not as clean."}
{"text":"One of my clients is at Yonge/Eg so I've eaten at this Pickle Barrel four times this summer.  I had the Chicken Parm, smoked meat sandwich, buttered chicken and breakfast (bacon and eggs).  Of the four, the breakfast was the best.  Anne was our server the last two times and she was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"As always an enjoyable time. Patrons turned off a tv when his team lost, seemed weird."}
{"text":"Grew up going to PB, with so many great memories and meals there as a kid! Unfortunately my last outings as an Adult at the Pickle Barrel at Sherway then at Promenade... and yes I tried once more for old-times'-sake, we went to the PB at Yorkdale this week. It was awful. My dinner guest ordered the deli-trio, all of the buns were stale. Not even a pickle was served with the deli-sandwiches - that just seems wrong! We couldn't find out which type of meat was on which bun, however much later we discovered by poking around in the sandwiches minus the stale buns, that they mixed all three meats on each sandwich, this seems weird - since my guest actually wanted to discover whether she preferred Smoked Meat versus Pastrami versus Corned Beef. Our server never came back to ask how our meal was. Washrooms had only cold water. Do the servers use these same washrooms to wash their hands as we do? If they do, that is scary too. The toilet did not flush. Fire alarm came on during our meal - since no one was running, and we didn't smell smoke, we finally managed to remove our hands from plugging our ears to wave our server over - she said it was the monthly fire alarm test. At this point, we told her about the stale bread and she said 'oh'. On a positive note, I ordered the beef brisket wrap which was tasty and juicy. I guess that I will just have to hold on to those special childhood happy PB memories, sorry that there will not be any new ones ever made. Bye-Bye Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"I think the prices are fair but the portions here are smaller than they are at the down town location near the Eaton Centre. Also the food tastes better at the one near the Eaton Centre. I found the food here very bland. I am giving it 3 stars because our server was extremely attentive and so nice. We sat on the patio, which was lovely. They had a heated lamp which was great for me since I am always cold. They also have lounge couches which would be nice if you're stopping by with friends for a drink. I loved the patio.  We ordered the lobster dip which was basically a runny, tasteless salsa. I think they forgot or ran out of an ingredient because our server asked us specifically about it and I told her it wasn't very great. It also took a long time for it to come out. I had to ask and it still took about 15 or so minutes after that. Our server asked if we wanted to replace the appetizer and I decided to get sweet potato fries. I'm glad I did because the portion of sweet potato fries with my boyfriend's turkey burger were measly at best. His burger was also minuscule. You would need a microscope to see it.  I didn't like that my caesar salad came out before the appetizer because then I was eating before everyone else.  My chicken pesto linguine was bland and oily, not as good as ones I've had at other Pickle Barrells and the chicken was overcooked and dry (pet peeve).  The sweet potato fries and dip were good and I was glad they brought out ketchup too because I like to dip them in ketchup and mayo :P.  I really, really liked the music playing at the Pickle Barrell. I had a fun time here but the food isn't the greatest. The patio's great so I will likely visit again."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking - anyone who orders a steak from Pickle Barrel deserves what's coming to them, but it was New Year's Eve so I felt like splurging a bit.   I ordered Steak Frites, medium. Maybe I should feel bad about joking with my friends about how there's no way that they were going to get the steak right, but when I received it I stopped feeling bad. It was just barely pink in the middle and grey on the outside.   I told the waiter I wanted to send it back. He took the plate but not without telling me that it was \"still pink inside\". Apparently he doesn't know the difference between medium and medium well.   The second steak I got was medium rare. Still not what I asked for but I didn't mind. And hey, it actually wasn't horrible.   Also, prepare to ask multiple times to get your water refilled! Probably one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves considering how simple of an ask that is..."}
{"text":"Got some takeout cornbeef sandwiches, portions were kinda small and the takeout guy had me on hold for the pre order for almost 10 minutes.  In the past experiences, i found the food to be jus OK."}
{"text":"Went about a week ago. Was really looking forward to it hadn't been in a couple of years. Wow what a disappointment. We ordered nachos which were stale portions very small also ordered ceaser salad which was very good but hard to screw up that. Won't go back. Way over priced for what you get"}
{"text":"Revamped pickel barrel. Looks much more upscale inside. Tight seating inside. They placed too many tables which partially block off the entrance to the patio area.   I was a bit peeved when I asked for a table of four and was told I would need to wait 25 minutes before I would be seated. There were several large tables that were free with no one seated. I was eventually seated. And those tables around me were still empty. Our server was nice, but not exactly the sharpest of the bunch.   Our food was served not all together, so some of us got our plates sooner, but our server did not bring any cutlery for some of us to start eating. We signalled for him that we needed cutlery, but he wanted to take someone's order first. After he took the other table's order, he proceeded to walk to the computer, and enter that table's order in the computer for like 10 minutes. Like wtf, go get us our cutlery, our food is getting cold. For a second I thought he didn't understand us, because who in their right mind would continue onto their other tasks when a customer is waiting to start their meal when it has been served. He then said that he was going to get us some cutlery. Took about another 10 minutes before he came back to our table with the last plate, and he had the cutlery with him. Really. What was the point of serving 3 out of 4 our plates, when you bring us the cutlery with the final plate? He really should have come brought us our cutlery to our tables, and then grab that last dish.   So I got the classic burger. Totally does not look anything like the photos on their menu. It's two measly patties that are dry and bland (no seasoning at all, wtf?) sandwiched in soft bun.   By the end of our meal we wanted to pay a mix of gift card and cash. He did not return the change, and I had to actually ask for it. I guess he actually thought he deserved a 40% tip."}
{"text":"Visited this newly renovated Pickel Barrel only to have such a terrible and disappointing experience. If I had a choice to give zero stars, I seriously would.  My biggest issue here is that every person who entered the kitchen did not wear a hair net, beard net, or a hat/cap or something to catch the hair (servers, prep staff, and even the manager). I could not believe my eyes when I saw a server with a full blown beard going in and out of the kitchen with plates of food on his arms. There should be a policy within any establishment that serves food to people that they have the option to either have food servers shave their beard or cover it with a beard net.  And then there was my server who didn't even tie her long hair up. This was most upsetting when we found a hair in my sister's soup.  We started off the night thinking it was going to be a great meal as the restaurant went through some very nice changes (a very well needed renovation). It immediately went downhill when I noticed that our server was very negligent...it took her forever to get our order down. Even throughout the meal, she never once came to our table to ask us how everything was. We had to flag her down whenever there was something we needed.  Our server was a filipino lady who spoke nicely to us, but that was it.  It was very evident from my meal experience that food safety is not on the management's mind because it did not seem like our server was properly trained on food safety practices. She handed us our dessert spoons with her thumb and fingers wrapped around the part we would scoop food with. I don't even wanna know what goes on in the kitchen.  In terms of the food... 1. Small hair found in chicken noodle soup (as mentioned above). 2. Random raw soybean sprout found on my dad's fish and chips plate. (if you have any food allergies, do not come here). 3. My mom's Spanish Paella did not have any mussels, despite the description and photo on their menu. Our server did not even notice this... and had to be informed by us... Then she made some excuse that the kitchen most likely ran out of mussels and added more shrimp. It only came with 4 shrimp. After doing some research on the interernet, 4 is normally the number of shrimp they add in Pickel Barrel's Spanish Paella. What a liar. She even did a little show and went to the kitchen to confirm, but really just lied to our faces. That is certainly not acceptable. We should have been informed ahead of time that there was firstly no more mussels and given the option to change our entree.... because really that dish is not worth 17.99 if you do not have mussels in it. As well, I wonder how many people they have done this too, because that's really just false advertisement. 4. The Spanish Paella was suuuuper salty. 5. The brownie in the mini dessert (chocolate brownie mousse) was super dry and hard. This is the first time I've been somewhere where the restaurant failed on dessert... please tell me how can this be?! 6. There was foreign material sticking to the rim of my dad's mini dessert cup.   All in all I felt that there was no quality control on the food or the service. We will give credit to the server for exchanging my mom's plate with another dish. However, her initial suggestion was to switch to a soup/salad instead of exchanging it with a comparably priced entree... like come on now. The bill came to a total of  $84, and for that kind of money, you kind of expect food that is safe to eat and to actually taste good."}
{"text":"Now closed and I understand why. Many decades ago Pickle Barrel was a restaurant you could on for good to very good deli food. Time to go back to your roots."}
{"text":"Terrible. Order the half chicken dinner with fries.  End result; ended up with super dry chicken and undercooked greasy fries."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant for the first time early today.  My friends and I were promptly greeted and seated. No more than one minute did our waiter come, introduce herself, and take our drink orders.    After a few minutes with the menus, we settle for a calamari starter and our main dishes. One of my friends food came before our and wayyy before our starter. The server was quite embarrassed and upset so she took our starters off the bill although we didn't notice or cared which was sweet of her. She apologized and a manger showed up to make sure very thing was okay.    The food was yummy and so was the service. I would def return."}
{"text":"This location is in my top five for worst restaurants on the planet. My masochistic tendencies mean that I am a repeat patron at this establishment.  One recent visit with 8 other family members, stands out as a particularly terrible experience.   So let's start from the beginning. First, we get sat in the front of the restaurant, which is notoriously understaffed. (Come to think of it the entire restaurant is generally under staffed) We ordered starters including bruschetta, and a bunch of different salads. The bruschetta wasn't so much bruschetta but rather tomatoes of salsa consistency with bread sticks that I guess you're supposed to dip into the supposed bruschetta mix. So we sent that back because it sucked. Fine, we screwed up and probably didn't read the menu right. Then onto the salads. My dad took a few bites and then noticed that the lettuce underneath was moldy and slimy. GROSS. As previously mentioned they were grossly understaffed, so after a hunt for the server we sent it back.   We also ordered milkshakes that sat on the pass for easily 10 minutes until my uncle pointed out that they were sitting there. The obvious thing that happens when a milkshake sits around is that it melts, so we got soup instead of Pickle Barrel's famous and usually delicious milkshakes.   Enough about the awful starters and stuff. Let's move onto the mains. Most of our food was cold, that was clearly due to no one picking it up from the pass.  My cousin ordered the fish tacos, they were barely cooked and super inedible, and once we tracked down our server it got sent back.  To their credit, they allowed my 80 year old grandmother to order off of the kids menu because adult sized portions would go to waste, but yet they managed to totally burn a regular old grilled cheese.   So you would think that after this horrendous experience a manager would come over to talk to us. Nope, not until we called her over.  I wish I could say this kind of thing is due to being a large party, but it's happened to me when grabbing lunch with just one other person. Pickle Barrel has had  the advantage of being the only sit down restaurant in Promenade Mall over the years. Now with the complete renovation of the food court, I would sooner go there then have to suffer ever again.  I wish you could give NO stars because that's how bad this place is."}
{"text":"Besides the convenience of being at the Y&E Centre and the Energy industries legal epicentre, i would never go here if it wasn't for the convenience of a lunch meeting.  That being said, every time i've come here - it's been a reminder why chain restaurants do just ok, but never do well. Aged, confused menu, food out of bags - it's just not worth spending your money on food like this."}
{"text":"Apparently, they have a different standard on medium rare. This is the worst steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place has totally improved since they renovated. And I'm not just talking about the design. Their coconut shrimp is the best I've ever tasted. The mac and cheese poppers are really good too. So are their fish and chips and the grilled cheese sandwich with avocado, roasted red peppers and brie. When you feel like something sweet, I love the mini turtles cheesecake shot. They bring an assortment of dessert shots to your table for you to choose from. My boyfriend and I go here quite a bit and he loves the strawberry cheesecake. The place is huge so you hardly ever have to wait to get in. Last time I had the chicken fajitas and the only complaint I have is that they give you so much chicken and only 3 little tortillas. But they were still pretty good."}
{"text":"My mixed green salad came like this. I was told by the manager that this was what they serve as their mixed greens."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is one of my favourite franchises, but this one at Bramalea really disappointed me. We went at 8pm (last call is at 8:45pm), which MAY have explained the bad food and service, but I don't think that should really be an excuse.  SERVICE - Slow service, took a while for the waitress to come by and get our bill, take our order or check up on us. We didn't even have cutlery when our food came, and waited for someone to come by.. but no one did, so we had to just take cutlery from other empty tables instead.  FOOD - Meh. Disappointing how it's worse than other Pickle Barrel's I've been to.  + Blue Cheese Burger $12.99 - comes with fries, pickle, and a coleslaw salad. Fries were not that hot and felt like it was not that fresh (may have been because we went at 8pm..) Patty was kind of dry.. had to squeeze ketchup to make it more edible. I wouldn't get this again.  + Cajun atlantic salmon penne $16.99 - comes with crostini (standard.. you can't really get this wrong), as well as soup or salad. The caesar salad was quite a big portion as a side salad, which was nice. Salmon penne was okay.. salmon was a tad dry. My friend also found a tiny piece of plastic in the penne.. she didn't bring it up to the waitress cause she didn't look pleased to serve us already (we should have mentioned it now that I think about it.. but oh well.)  Sigh."}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel is quite good.  They are willing to accommodate a large group at last minute notice as well.  :) The portion sizes are quite big and the prices are very very reasonable.  Their menu is quite large so you will have plenty of option to choose from.  They have a very good smoothie/milkshake menu as well which is perfect for the non alcoholic drinkers like myself.  :) I was quite impress with my food.  I paid $13.99 for egg plant Parmesan, with spaghetti and a side of Cesar salad."}
{"text":"Three of us came for lunch. Ordered two pastas and a sandwich. The fries that came with the sandwich were soggy and still cold in the middle. Both orders of pasta came with a spoon that had dried food still on the handles from a previous meal. The food was mediocre. It was a very unpleasant meal. Most likely will not be returning here. ((EDIT: the manager did come speak to us about our experience))"}
{"text":"VIBE  The place looks like it hasn't been updated since the mid 90s. Think of the band Colour Me Bad's wardrobe splashed across the interiors. It's a little bit like that.  It's also a bit of a maze to get through to the back but plenty of booth seating which is great for a work lunch.   I ATE  Let's just say there is a LOT of choice on the menu, which is a mini book. A quick look on their website assures me there are 300 menu items. That's crazy. CRAY. I had the Mushroom Burger. It was OKAY. It looked cooked. Not really impressed to be honest. Now I know.   Colleagues had Rose Reisman's Warm Chicken Spinach salad. This looked pretty good. I would recommend this or the other salads. Suffice to say, you won't go hungry here!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  So I wouldn't get the burger here again. But I'm not going to get in a \"PICKLE\" about it! Mwah ha ha."}
{"text":"I eat here rarely, and not because I want to. Frequently I get sick with how much grease is in their food, I ordered chicken strips and fries and it wasn't seasoned and tasted of oil. I ordered a turkey burger and, even though I couldnt tell if it was under cooked or not, it got me sick. The poke bowl got me sick. I've lost any desire to eat here."}
{"text":"As a regular as this establishment, my father has been coming to this location since it opened several years ago. So it was a surprise for me to hear the following as I write my super negative review. If you want a nice peaceful meal without being verbally assaulted with false accusations by the wait staff, unfortunately this is no longer the place to come.   Negative stars big time as I listen to the story of the crazy waitress verbally assault and make false accusations of my father. A waitress that he has never seen nor dealt with prior to this embarrassing assault in front of other patrons. She threatened police action if he were to go back, he one upped he and offered that the police come now. If they had anything substantial to back their crazy accusations, why didn't they call the police? Because they have just lost a regular patron due to a looney toon waitress.   He has been a regular at this establishment since it opened without issue, and is friendly with the rest of the wait staff, unfortunately the manager that he is friends with had recently resigned her position and the new manager, which he didn't know either, backed up the crazy waitress. Luckily he received supportive comments from other wait staff.  i find this type of behaviour despicable, deplorable, and unprofessional. Outrageous lies by a waitress, backed by a manager new to the position, we think we have an idea of what she was trying to do, but i don't want to be hit with any slander.  Obviously I don't even think they deserve the mediocre 2 stars that they do have, but maybe Yelp should allow at least a zero star rating, as I feel i am over rating them by being forced to give them one star."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of pickle barrel but it just happened to be where I ended up with two friends today for lunch.  I like that they actually have items that are labelled gluten free, as well as a list of foods on the website that are naturally gfree or modified ways to order meals. Simple pleasures ;)  I ordered the santafe bowl, which was quinoa, avocado, tomatoes, corn, chicken and black beans. It was supposed to have some sort of lime dressing but I didn't taste it. The meal was good - very filling and very tasty. It was also a fairly decent price at $15.99.  My biggest complaint would be the incredibly slow service we received. It took about an hour to get our drinks and my friend ordered a dry white wine and was brought a warm, fruity wine. White should never be warm, but it also seemed like he just didn't know what dry meant (in which case he should have asked for clarification instead of assuming).  She sent the wine back and it took at least 20 minutes to get her new wine. A little ridiculous.  I had no qualms with my delicious Bellini and my other friend enjoyed her martini.  Overall, the gfree options would probably tempt me at least a few more times, but my overall opinion of pickle barrel is still just meh."}
{"text":"I would give minus stars if I could. For some stupid reason I came back to this restaurant and again, had a horrible experience. The staff here is the worst. Not only did we complain, but a woman was very frustrated with the hostess as we arrived, and another couple was in line behind us to speak to the manager. I can't even believe this location is still open.  On top of all this! I wrote an email to the co-operator or whatever (Arthur) earlier in the week and I haven't yet received a reply. Really disgusting service by this location."}
{"text":"Tried out the new PIckle Barrel today.  It reminds me of walking into a Milestone the way it's been decorated and the way menu is set up.   The decor is nice and the tables don't feel too crowded together which is a plus. It's less reminiscent of a jewish deli now and more main stream.  The food wasn't bad the portions were quite large.  For being open two days I would say that they are doing well there are still a few kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is one of those chains that I've always been overwhelming disappointed by, but when you're starving and your first choice for dinner has a 25 minute wait, you settle for the less attractive next door neighbour.   If it's not obvious already, a lot of my review will mimic my counterpart, Katharine, as I dined here with her and her fiancé (her review is spot-on, by the way and I'll try not to repeat most of it).  We were seated, in a booth, quickly by a friendly hostess. We waited quite some time for our server. When he finally came, although he was nice enough, he was a bit too casual for my liking. I got the vibe that he was there to make money and wasn't particularly interested in ensuring that you have a great dining experience. It's Pickle Barrel though, so again, I didn't have high expectations to begin with.   Again to mimic Katharine, the Mac and Cheese balls were pretty decent but man, my grilled cheese was terrible. Dry and bland. I couldn't finish it. I should mention that I always finish my food. If I don't, I take the rest home with me. I hate wasting food. This was close enough to cardboard though that there was no point in bringing it home. That said, the beef barley soup I had with my sandwich was pretty good.   We were offered the dessert menu; we took a quick peek but weren't interested. I've always felt that it's too difficult for a restaurant with such a large menu to offer decent food. Seems it's still true. It would also help the chain if the servers were more attentive, like checking up on us during our meal and refilling our drinks without us having to wave him down. He brought us water when we were seated though, so that was nice.  Interesting to note: Pickle Barrel doesn't offer pitchers of beer. They have beer on tap. Why are there no pitchers?"}
{"text":"Never cared to create an account to post a negative review until now.  This place has gone downhill in a predictable manner. Yonge and Eglinton is a prime location, so these guys don't even care anymore.  From my past 3 visits, they got the orders wrong every single time, and responded to a quiet and reasonable request to fix the order with accusations and attitude. Today was the last visit. Ordered 2 Egg Benedicts with salmon, morning potatoes, and multigrain bread, and what we got was 2 plates full of cold chunks of what I am going to hope were actual potatoes, wrong bread type, ham (instead of salmon), green salad with a strange odorless/tasteless/colorless (water?) liquid on it and what looked (and tasted) like vomit instead of hollandaise sauce.  When I told the waitress that the order was wrong, she went on the offensive that I either didn't tell her exactly what I wanted or that she didn't hear me because I wasn't loud enough. She took the plates back and a few minutes later came back the exact same plates with a few strips of salmon on the side. She threw the plate on the table, with stuff almost sliding off them.  We barely ate anything. Quietly paid our bill and left. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"I find their menu way too large for them to concentrate on making any one thing on it truly great.  Everything is mediocre, but passable I guess... I went here on Saturday for breakfast (they have a $4.99 breakfast until 10:30am) which consisted of 3 eggs (more if you want just egg whites...why? You know its probably coming out of a box!), 2 slices of bacon, toast and some fruit. I exchanged my bacon for sausage which was a mistake, as they didn't seem cooked enough and I wound up not eating them. The eggs were good, but how can you mess up scrambled eggs? Coffee was $2.50...that's a little steep.  They were just finishing up renovations and I noticed that it's a massive restaurant...and then I also noticed that it only has 2 single stall washrooms for the whole thing (unless there are more at the front?) but that has to be the most ridiculous arrangement ever.  Disappointed, I have good memories of other locations. Maybe I'll stick to those."}
{"text":"We had a decent dinner here.  The food is really not overly exciting, they still have the classic pickle barrel staples like smoked meat sandwiches and deli, along with a plethora of other items, including Asian, Italian and middle eastern inspired dishes. Something to please everyone, I suppose. I didn't find anything to be entirely innovative or interesting.   The restaurant was closing early because of a staff event which is fine, but it did seem like the servers and hostesses were  really trying to keep reminding us to be out as soon as possible.   The food was decent, I had the brisket sandwich which was covered in gravy, with a side of tomato soup and it comes with a pickle and coleslaw. Everyone enjoyed their meal. One person in our party ended up having to share the deli platter with someone else because they ran out of the ribs and couldn't find anything else on the menu that she wanted and this was 15-20 minutes after we had placed our orders. We got a lot of apologies but generally restaurants give a discount or something to make things right, we didn't receive anything to that effect.  The restaurant has been renovated quite a few years back and it's warm and welcoming. The food is ok, nothing exciting to be honest, if you want a simple meal for a reasonable price or if you're with picky eaters, the pickle barrel is a good stop."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this location, but now I will NEVER go back.  I was here this evening with two of my colleagues. One of them had black stuff in her drink and a green bug crawling in her bowl. In hindsight, this is when we should have left. My colleague  got a replacement drink and an entire new meal. A few minutes later we noticed a roach. Yes a ROACH crawling on the chair next to us. That was it, we got our purses and headed out. The part that got me is how nonchalant the manager was about the roach. She did validate as customers we had every right to complain to headquarters, which I will be doing tomorrow. It's disappointing how this location has gone down. I hope the do a proper cleaning and extermination so nothing seriously happens to a customer. This will be my last time going to this location."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a group of 10. The food was terrible. The service was worse. No plates or glasses were cleared during our meal, no refills of water or pop offered. We were also charged an automatic 15% gratuity for a large group. Perhaps that's why the server didn't do anything, he knew he was making money regardless of how he treated us!   Do not eat here. Save your money. Go to the food court."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a lower rating than the one I gave. The host showed us to our table and it took 20 minutes to get a glass of water. What was really amazing was that out of the 6 servers on the floor that night I've made eye contact with all of them to try and order but was ignored. I had to repeatedly call a server that was passing by and if I had not said it for the 6th time he would've kept walking. Truly atrocious experience."}
{"text":"They've renovated this location so I was hoping the food had gotten better. Big mistake. I got sick after eating their calimari appetizer. Even their Rose Reisman dishes tasted awful. It's too bad because this location is so convenient next to the movie theatre. I don't know why it's always full of people. Everytime I eat here I get sick to my stomach. Unlike other Pickel Barrel locations."}
{"text":"We were here on a Saturday afternon for my Mom in law's Bday. It was really busy. So we were glad we had a reservation since we were a group of 11 people. We got the private room at the back which was nice, but it seemed as if we got forgotten there. We had to go hail a waiter to get menu's & to order. The food is the same quality as other Pickle Barrel's but the service wasn't so great. They screwed up the billing & we had to get them to correct it two times. Perhaps if we'd been a smaller group & in the main body of the restaurant we wouldn't have been forgotten so easily."}
{"text":"Despite it being busy we still got a table relatively quickly. Our server was also very nice. She let us know that the food would be a little slow because there was a party there this afternoon. I had the Rose Reisman Maple Salmon & it was delicious. Everyone else at the table was satisfied with their food as well. Good location, even if it does get busy later on in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Nancy told me to visit more locations, so I did.  1 server but if they get more, ask for Cheryl.  This location offers tea/coffee with the early bird, Bonus... But because of that, they were more busy ...  My server apologized for being tied up at another table, haven't had a sorry from servers in a long time, they're usually just blasé...  Ordered the super salad, they ran out yesterday.. Why did the hostess give me a super menu if it's missing items? Or why not point it out???  I was allowed to substitute(another first in the restaurant business in a while) toast for more fruit.  Refill came a bit late(but 1 server for 10 tables) can't fault her...   Oh yeah, 3 slices of bacon instead of 2 and it seemed \"thicker?\"  I can cook breakfast at home. I go out to sit, eat, unwind and enjoy life...   5 stars because of all around \"everything\" made it a good experience.    Tough choice, going to Vaughan mills by my home or spending the extra 8 minutes to come here.. It might be worth the drive."}
{"text":"I got an email from pickle barrel... try our \"new stuffed French toast\" looked so good... so I went to the easiest location I could visit... last time I said I wouldn't come back... I'm stupid for not heeding my own advice.  Manager who was probably the only saving grace to the establishment looked at me dumbfounded when I requested the \"new\" item. So I showed him on my phone, the email. Straight up told me, \"we're a bit dated.\"   So I told him I would need a few more minutes to find a new item. But I stuck around and ordered a coke.  The server brought my beverage instantaneously which would be a good thing, but she was upset that I hadn't decided yet, in 30 seconds, sorry... I asked for 1 minute...  She came back after 5, I'm pressed for time and I knew I was fubar today, I was going to order something else but I just went with the nachos, you can't screw that up and they possibly can't take forever...  Forever later and several games of candy crush, she brings it out. Drops it on the table walks off.  I shout at her(nicely and to get her attention) \"sorry\" stumbles back, \"can I get a refill on my Pepsi\" \"we don't have Pepsi we have coke.\" I'm vexed at this point. \"Whatever you have, I need a refill\" A minute later the manager brings me out my refill.  That was the end of the day. Never had her come back, never asked if I was okay, food was ok or anything. I chased down the manager got the bill and paid.  If anyone sees me dining here again! Mention this review and I'll give you $20 on the spot! FML"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery through just eat.  Everything was stone cold when it arrived. I got the Manhattan steak which was nicely cooked although freezing. It came with a school lunch style small scoop of mashed potato and around 6 green beans. The four \"jumbo garlic shrimp\" that cost 5 bucks were just normal small shrimp. They were cold, too.  The P.B House Burger was overly greasy, the side of fries looked like it came from the children's menu it was so tiny, and of course, it was all cold.  We asked that the steak be sent in a separate container, it wasn't.  The whole experience (including delivery and tip) came to just over $70 for two people. Never again."}
{"text":"I don't like Pickle Barrel to begin with.  The food is boring, bland, and no matter how they dress up their restaurants it is still a sub par chain restaurant.  Out of all of the PBs, this one has got to be the worst one of them all.    I was with a buddy a couple of weeks ago and we were hungry but nothing else in the neighbourhood was appealing, so we decided to go to PB only because we knew what we were going to get....we were wrong.  1. We arrived and had to wait for 5 minutes (no exaggeration for the hostess to arrive at her post.  She arrives holding a cleaning cloth!  First, a hostess should be at her post or at least close by so she can greet the guests!  2. The dining room looked like a tornado went through it.  With all the staff around, you would think the place would be efficient and spotless.  The place felt greasy.  3. Our waitress was nice, and calm while all the other staff looked frazzled and running around doing every job.  The hostess was seen clearing tables and taking plates into the kitchen.  Not efficiently either....what was the wait staff or bus staff doing?  4. The food was more bland and tasteless than other PBs.  Surely, nothing to crow about.  In the end, I was thoroughly disappointed with my smoked meat sandwich, and the club sandwich my friend had was passable.  The fries were of the frozen variety and tasted very bland.  Some people may describe it as cardboard, but I've never tasted cardboard.  I don't give a lot of 1 stars because there is usually some sort of redeeming factor to be found.  I did not find anything redeeming about this Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"I have had very poor experiences at 90% of the Pickle Barrel locations I have gone to.  I have always had plenty to complain about...not that I am actively looking to pick on something but they have a horrible habit of disappointing chain-wide.  From poor past experiences I reserve the PB as a last option destination.  After a Saturday night at the movies my friend and I decided to go for a drink, she suggested to me we go to the PB. Considering it was for one drink, I figured it could not hurt.  When we approached the front hostess station, the two young girls were so self absorbed in their own conversation they ignored us.  With no acknowledgement I was turned off and walked in to the bar area. They could not break away from their conversation for a mere second to welcome guests and to say you may sit anywhere you wish at the bar section.  That is all I wanted to hear because sometimes they may be full due to the movie crowd.  The manager came by to check up on us about 3 short minutes after we sat down to ask if everything was okay, if we'd been looked after by the wait staff; I was pleasantly surprised by this very proactive manager; and I promptly informed her.  She was so nice and attentive that she apologized and went to talk to the pair up front right away.  This is the only location of the PB where I have gone to a few times previous with groups and did not experience any of the other PB issues at other locations.  I would have given a one star review for the poor customer service but the manager at the bar section brought it up to three, even though we only had a drink each.  I hope this management staff can set an example for the staff to be pro-active and well trained. The entire chain of PB sorely need this level of management if they are to improve on a wider scale."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Yorkdale location of the PB chain for years. It's practically hidden underground between Bowring and the rest of the mall at the west Bay Store end, but don't let the fact that you need to take an escalator down to Pickle Barrel put you off.  This is a nice casual deli restaurant to nosh in. PB's claim to fame is a huge menu with a variety of fresh & healthy food selections while keeping the traditional deli sandwiches and seafood & all- day breakfast items. I like to start off with a green matcha tea smoothie and homemade soup of the day and end with their mini- desserts tray. For the price of 2 desserts you get 6 mini- desserts, all scrumptious. I wouldn't recommend their fries, they are too dry and thin, but otherwise, you can hardly go wrong. The atmosphere is much better than the location would lead you to expect.  It's a huge spacious dining room with lots of alcoves to provide privacy and small colourful overhead lamps everywhere. You won't mind there are no windows and you'll certainly forget you're in a big shopping mall."}
{"text":"I like this location, it is nice to drop in just before the movie at the Rainbow cinema or even better after long shopping day. Service is friendly and quite efficient so I'm not sure why others claim it is slow. The decor is nothing special but ok for a casual dining. I like that the food is freshly made and their soup of the day is always a hit. Our favorites include PEI spicy mussels and pasta, bruschetta is alright as well. Their cocktail selection is quite good and very reasonably priced all around $6-7. I like their Bellinis, they are huge and you can have one glass all night. Overall a great neighborhood PB, good for families and couples alike."}
{"text":"Its more a 2.5 star. Friday night came here at around 7:45pm was a 10 min wait for 2 ppl but when we were brought to our table we notice the restaurant was not even full maybe half full. Wasnt sure why there was a wait for the table. Hostess was friendly. Our server was kinda hard selling. Kept asking if we want the $5 beer deal. When we order a cocktail he kept asking if we want to add another shot for $2.99, I told him its fine and he askes again. Food came pretty quick. Food tasted alright. Wasnt great but wasnt bad. Prices are average price. Server did come twice check on us. Menu does have a lot of options. May come back if no other choices.  Update 3 hrs later. Decide to change it to 1 star. We waited for at least 20 mins to try to locate where our server went. We did not see him amd ask the hostess for the bill and she said she will get it right away. 7 mins later she was out of sight. Server finally came over after disappearing for more than 20 mins. Didnt ask if anything was alright n pushed us in getting dessert. I also think they put alot of salt or MSG. I was thirst and still so dehyrated and keep needing to drink water 3 hrs after the meal. I definitely will not come back. Atleast not to the Yorkdale location."}
{"text":"This is my second time at a Pickle Barrel and you will note on my other review that I wasn't all that impressed. But today I went again, not my choice it was a \"going away\" lunch for a co-worker, but I'm really glad I went.  What I ate: Triple Bacon B.L.T. (from their menu description, applewood smoked bacon, peameal bacon, prosciutto, crispy bacon aioli, tomato, lettuce, artisan bread)  What I thought: Delicious flavours, from the crispness of the bacon to the savory aioli. This sandwich was so good. I paid the extra to have the sweet potato fries (glad I did) and was completely full.  Price: Well, I'm a little frugal (that's just me) but this place fell within my accepted lunch budget (less than $15).  Service: Our waitress, Janina, was attentive and made sure that we were kept up-to-date on our order delivery time (i.e. when she'd walk by, she would take a moment to let us know our lunch would be ready soon). Our glasses of water were filled, the table cleared and the bills taken care of in a professional manner.  I will definitely go back and plan on taking my husband, next time he's out in Brampton."}
{"text":"One morning I woke up in one of those moods and said to myself, \"Treat yo-self girl\". Yes, I said it exactly like that. I decided to go to pickle barrel for breakfast solo because I remembered my mum saying she enjoyed it. From my first interaction with the hostess to my last interaction with the waitress I felt really welcomed. Everyone was attentive, informative and didn't make me feel like a crazy lady eating breakfast and drinking cocktails solo while I watched TV on my iPad. My waitress (sorry I forgot your name but she was a nubian queen) recommended the DEEP FRIED FRENCH TOAST. Honestly, they don't look that appetizing but they are delicious. Slightly crispy and crunchy in the outsude and soft and pillowy on the inside. It was very filling, I couldnt finish it. Next time I wake up in one of those moods I will be paying pickle barrel a visit."}
{"text":"Chicken was a bit dry and the potatoes aren't pealed but the dessert was big and delicious! Our waitress Mallory (sp?) was excellent, she checked in on us throughout the evening and even went the extra mile at the end of dinner service when she ran up the escalator to return my friend's phone to her."}
{"text":"I really didn't enjoy my experience here.  Our server was pleasant and seated us promptly.   The food absolutely lacked flavour. I ordered the pasta with eggplant and my eggplant was not even cooked! I couldn't eat it at all. The sweet potato fries were not even fully cooked either. How could you mess up fries? It was just overall a horrible experience. My friends and I were very disappointed with the food"}
{"text":"Really bad experience at this location. Went on a Friday around 8pm, 3 guests (including myself).  Service - not worthy of the title, sorry. I arrived later than my friends, but she figured that we already knew what we wanted. She kept rushing us to order. Want us to order faster PB? Have a smaller menu. We ordered wine with our main, she spilled at least a quarter of mine on the table and wiped it up and did not top up my drink... After RUSHING us all through the beginning of our meal, she was nowhere to be seen for dessert... Oh, nobody at the front desk greeted me or asked me why I was hanging around (was waiting for my friend to get me). Pretty shitty service. My friend forgot her ID and the waitress LECTURED us on why she needed to have her ID to order drinks. My friend, before this lecture, had already said it was fine as it was her fault she didn't have an ID. Don't know why the lecture was necessary, we're not 14, we get it.  Food -  Two starters to share: Mozzarella sticks - no flavour, I could easily pass these again. California Avacado Springrolls - I was hoping for some distinction between the flavours they said would be in it. Best part of this would be the sauce it comes with.  I ordered the Canadian Cheddar Cheese Burger. Was HORRIBLE. The fries were bad, there was ONE slice of cheese on my burger. A really small slice. The burger itself was dry and disgusting. Friend 1 ordered the Spanish Paella, this was DELICIOUS! Friend 2 (sans ID) ordered the French Toast thing - it was HUGE portion and was nicely presented. She was very satisfied with her order.  I'm a fat ass (and didn't finish all my meal) got the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake - wasn't as warm as I remember it being but it was good. My friends got the smaller version of the cheesecake, they were satisfied.  EDIT: forgot about drinks, pass on the martini special...unless you're getting the chocolate one. That one is delicious!  Suffice to say, I did not tip."}
{"text":"So my wife and I came here for lunch. We had an hour to spend before our X-Men: Apocalypse movie at Silvercity Yonge Eglinton.  We ordered French Onion Soup, Everything Salad, Chicken on Waffle, and Fish and Chips.   Friendly staff. Don't be shy to chat them up. The Shock Top our waiter suggested was great, I really like it!  French Onion Soup was delicious and not too salty. Fish and chips I had was nice and crispy, and the fish was moist inside. Would order again if I'm craving for fish and chips.   Bill came to $65 plus 15% tips. Not bad!  Would definitely come back and try their dinner service.   Food:  4/5 Ambience:  4/5 Quality:  4/5 Service:  4/5"}
{"text":"Great service & fresh food here! We came for a family breakfast here on a busy sat morning. We got seated quickly and the tables were clean. Our waitress was bubbly and friendly. She was patient with us and quick to repond to our requests.   We ordered breakfast food and it wasnt a long wait. We were really happy with the quality of food and the service."}
{"text":"We came here last night (September 17) for dinner. The food is in small servings and very expensive. It's ok to pay that kind of amount if the food is worth (delicious) but not.We waited for our food for almost 1 hour and then when we asked our waiter, Justin, he said food is coming soon coz he has other things to do that's why he can't check the food. He should not even say that to us. Customer is more important and they have only very few customers last night. But we just keep quite. Customer service sucks and so with the food. We'll never come back here anymore!"}
{"text":"With the price I paid ($78) for, I can definitely have better food somewhere else. We ordered Pork sausage & egg ($8.99); Famous Deli Sandwich ($11.99); 2 dishes from the limited time summer menu and one PB signature cake ($6.99)."}
{"text":"I am done with pickle. Every time I have visited in the last year it seems the quality of the food goes down. A side salad with a meal used to be an appetizing blend of ingredients, the last time it was small dish of unappetizing looking lettuce with some strips of carrot and apple on top. If a person can't depend on the fact that a meal they ordered last month will be the same meal this time then it just becomes an adventure in the dining that I can do without. As for the service well I will leave that to the other less enamoured reviewers, suffice to say \"Good bye Pickle Barrel\" It was nice knowing you for a while."}
{"text":"No food in the fridge? That calls for a trip to pickle barrel. Why do they even call it pickle barrel anyways? They don't even serve pickles there. That's okay, cuz I hate pickles anyways.  I always come running back to the burgers here. The Classic and PB House in particular. I do enjoy how the meal comes with a side salad. Gotta get my greens in! I also hate greens, but like I said, I gotta get them in.   Another favourite of mine is the strawberry killer shake. Never get rid of this! This shake is bigger than my vocabulary and under $5! It's amazing! I'm salivating just thinking of it. Can I get one to go?  Service here is usually pretty ok, but it can get busy."}
{"text":"Just like the reviews here in Yelp, the Pickle Barrel at Yorkdale Mall has a lot of inconsistencies that really makes this restaurant disappointing.  I've been here less than half a dozen times and it's gotten progressively worse. I had a bad experience with our server and our food during my last visit in April.  Our server expressed her disinterest in serving us from start to finish. She didn't take down our orders, insisting that she knew them, despite there being some dietary restrictions. Lo and behold, those things ended up in our food.  I got the PB House burger from there and there was a real lack in flavour. I only know that because I've had it on multiple occasions and I loooooved it.  I find big restaurant chains lack the ability to change when staff don't seem to care about their customers. Not sure if this location will likely change, but because they're situated in one of the biggest malls in Ontario, they'll always have customers."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because I can have breakfast for dinner while my company can still enjoy regualr dinner foods. Menu has been revamped so it's not as extensive as before. There are a lot of new items as well. Tried the fried mac and cheese balls and they were delicious. Come in five with spicy ketchup and perfect to share. The lobster benedict had a decent amount of lobster for the price. Eggs were poached the way I like it. The mini desserts are the perfect size to end the meal with. Server was very attentive and friendly. Without being asked, she comped the smoothie when she noticed we didn't drink it due to its off taste."}
{"text":"Came here after a bad waiting experience from boom co. Was seated fast and the server made up for the lack of service we had just experienced at boom. Huge menu, had a hard time making a decision, but stuck with the thick cut french toast. Food was fast and quite satisfying. Was the first time my husband had come here for brunch, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My kids like this place. Unsophisticated and average, it is well balanced for a family of four."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after ordering Shittake Mushroom burger with Angus Beef along with mashed potatoes, yesterday night. Tastewise it was so bland and oily, you could feel that the burger patty was frozen and cooked. The mashed potatoes were just plain potatoes that someone had beaten up. Upon asking the waiter, he informed that they mash it in the morning and store it in freezer !! He replaced the mashed potatoes with fries, but the damage was already done. Giving one star only because of good service.  My sister ordered grilled chicken sandwich, and it was bland too. For appetizers, we had ginger chicken bites. They were like someone had fried the chicken in morning, microwaved it before giving us, and was topped with ginger sauce. Nothing like the pics in menu !!"}
{"text":"First off, I am not a huge Pickle Barrel fan.  For years they have had a MASSIVE menu and for some reason, I always would either get something I ended up hating or would fall back to a plain jane quarter chicken dinner.    So about 6m to a year prior to this visit, I finally had a nice Shrimp Pasta with a side caesar salad and piece of toasted garlic bread and ... LOVED IT!  My wife also found a nice new dish - Hoisin Chicken.  So based on the prior good experience (after so/so experiences before) we had high hopes for this visit.  And of course wouldn't you know it - a NEW reduced/simplified/healthy menu.    Meaning? - Yes, my shrimp dish is no more. - Yes, my wife's Hoisin Chicken was dropped - and they kept the Hoisin Beef.  She ordered this and though it was fine, it wasn't as good.  Further, as per her comments, if you are providing a healthy menu, why would you offer beef over chicken - when starting with both and then removing one?  In our eyes - they BLEW IT.  And to make matters worse - coming as a family I don't want to spend a fortune and the PB was probably the easiest on the wallet.  (Nice mall but have always felt their food court was up there with one of the worst of all the surrounding malls).  Next time I guess we either eat at home and/or go somewhere else before hitting Yorkdale.   Sad.  Bathrooms were clean though the paper dispensers were not 100% operational; we arrived a little later than planned and had to wait about 10m but otherwise all went well.  But yeah, this is a place where if you think you can sit down at 6pm by just strolling in, good luck.  If I could I would give PB 2.5, but I can't and won't give it a 3.  The food quality tends to be fresh and good but management's menu change was abysmal.  Visit September 27th, 2013."}
{"text":"I just completed a review for the Pickle Barrel meal I had yesterday (spoilers: It was terrible) when I realized I was actually at another Pickle Barrel Location just last week, on Thursday.  I didn't order food that time, however I did have drinks and our server seemed to completely forget about us. Both our waters and our alcoholic beverages were completely empty and we kept trying to flag down a different server - any server!! - without luck for the three hours we were there. As a result, I had only two drinks over that entire period, but with the week I'd had, I could have easily been convinced to have 3 or 5 drinks if a waiter had been nearby so I could place my orders!  It was really surprising and disappointing. I've actually never had service that bad. We had to order our second round through a different server (or perhaps busser) who was just walking by. We didn't see our original server again until we flagged down the hostess to have someone bring us our cheque."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special.  I can't find anything wrong with it really, so technically according to the way I score things it should get a 5.   Service was good, food quality was fair, pricing was fair, location is decent, and overall experience was good.  So... no complaints.  But at the end of the day, this is just an average place.  There are 1000's of other places like it.  Nothing bad to say, nothing particularly good to say either.   Derek"}
{"text":"I would like to talk to someone directly about how terrible of an experience I had today at this location."}
{"text":"Good restaurant to take a picky eater to! They have the biggest menu I have ever seem - it goes on for pages...it's literally a book. We go there when we are all in the mood for different things. Service is also usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Pickle Barrel I've ever been to! I am a big fan of the Pickle Barrel at Yonge and Eglinton, but not this place! First of all, our server was not attentive at all. The napkins he brought to our table had stains from previous customers *gross* The utensils were not too clean either! I had to ask the server to bring me a new set of utensils because they were not washed properly and rest assure that I, by no means have OCD! We wanted to have our salad with our meal, but the salad came first. So, we finished it, because the wait for our main course became too long and we were starving. Finally, I got a big plate of shish kabob, but some of the pieces were burned and the rest of it did not taste good. So, I ordered some lemon, so I could at least make it edible. The waiter brought the smallest piece of lemon possible!! I just couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant and write this review for everyone to know and avoid this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A place where 90% of the customers are seniors. They have renovated the place and you can definitely tell that it has moved up a notch in terms of class. The service was great! We asked about the complimentary salad that used to be a part of the main dish we ordered and even though we were told that they have discontinued it, and they don't even offer Parmesan cheese because (manager's quote: \"cheese price has gone up\") with pasta, they made an exception for our table and gave us free salads. We had 3 different guys coming up to our table asking how the food is. Honestly, the food was good, but it was quite average. It can get really annoying when they keep asking the same question over and over, while you're trying to talk with your friends and eat.   pros: free parking in the mall parking lot, good service, decent food, reasonable price   cons: can't think of any, other than the fact that the vibe is too mellow. After all, it's located inside the most boring mall I've seen (but for others that can be a pro), Also, there's nothing on the menu that excites me enough to comment on (very average meals)."}
{"text":"I LOVE Pickle Barrel!  This restaurant is particularly special to me, because this is where my hubby and I had our very first date!    I have been to this location in particular many times, and have almost always had a great experience! This location in particular gets packed, since it is located in Yorkdale Mall. So expect a wait of 15-20mins at the very least.  Their menu is like a mini novel, especially if it is your first time here, it can be overwhelming at first. But you are guaranteed to find something for everyone, no matter what the dietary restrictions or preference. The menu is organized well, so you can skip a page (or pages) if you know you don't want a type of food.  Some of the dishes I have re-tried and find amazing here are:  Coconut Shrimp (perfect amount of coconut flavor, not overly sweet like some other places) Any of their Fish entrees Pasta's are also tasty Chocolate Molten Lava Cake (absolutely divine! The BEST to date I have ever had!! Anywhere!!)  Overall, their appetizers and desserts are amazing, a must try. If anything pack your main course to go   The décor and overall ambiance of this location is very nice, dim and calming - even when it is packed! They have different sections, which are slightly different from one another, but yet an open restaurant. Does not appear boxy and secluded.  Great restaurant to come with friends, a date, the significant other or even family."}
{"text":"To give this place a one star is giving them more than they deserve. I've been to this place twice and both times have had really bad experiences.  The food overall is not bad. So A+ for the kitchen staff to be able to keep this place afloat, however the serving staff are all messes.  Today, I needed to get someone to ask where my server was as I waited over 15 minutes to have my order taken. The man who came to ask what we wanted was wearing a hat and had the most unprofessional looking appearance. I didn't even think he worked there.  After taking our order we didn't see him again until he brought out food. We needed to ask the host/bus girl for coffee and for a to go container as our sever did not return to the table.  Finally when we did see him, we saw him talking to what appeared to be a friend who worked there by the serving station instead of seeing how his tables were doing. We watched him doing this about 4 times while we were there and people needed things.  This obviously reflected in his tip by us not giving one because the service was so poor. He just watched as we asked other people for things we needed. If it wasn't for the bus girl/hostess getting us a few things we wouldn't have gotten anything after our initial introduction.  When I called to complain to the manager, she did nothing but compliment her staff and say that she would retrain them. Funny enough, the last time we were there we had this lady as a server and we weren't that pleased with her service either. So good luck \" Retraining, your staff.\"  It seems like it's the blind leading the blind at that restaurant.   Needless to say, I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my go-to restaurants. I was here with a friend 2 days a go and the service has gotten better. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Quesadilla and it hit the spot! It was lightly grilled with cheese, mushrooms, onions, red peppers and chicken. Served with sour cream and salsa on the side.   I also love their All Day Breakfast. Especially the Eggs Benedict.  It's a filling meal at a great value! You get to choose the options offered for bacons and eggs. Served with mini sauteed potatoes and various fruits on the side. Missed breakfast this morning?  Well, you can have it for dinner!   The food and the ambience was great however, I had one concern about our server and restaurant. For dessert, she offered us \"Samplers\" of mini desserts.  She brought a selection over for us to choose from and we had our picks.  It turns out that these \"Samplers\" were really samplers... My friend and I assumed they were free of cost since they were called \"Samplers\" and I'm pretty certain others have too. The cost wasn't a big deal but it's the principle that mattered. I believe we weren't the first ones to be mislead and lead into this trap. It was pretty upsetting how we were mislead this way.   I googled the menu and these mini dessert \"Samplers\" were there for a cost. They should remove/change these \"Samplers\" to avoid confusion or better yet, be REAL mini dessert Samplers that's free of cost!  So if you're ever offered \"Samplers\" for dessert you should beware!"}
{"text":"The food at this location sucks. The servers don't come back to check if everything's ok. Overall just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment whenever I come here. Well for this location per say. However, in general Pickle Barrel has so many choices for meals that range from juicy steaks, to pasta, to vegetarian options. The wait to be seated wasn't bad at all considering it was a Saturday evening (wait was about 10mins) and the atmosphere is very nice. The waitress that served us was very cool and made with our orders pretty quickly.   For the food, definitely trying the pasta my friend had (I think it was gnocchi with cream sauce and mushrooms which was awesome)."}
{"text":"Worst experience so far. My family and I sat there for 30 mins waiting for the memu. Horrible horrible service. I would never come back"}
{"text":"Went here for mother's day and it wasn't that busy surprisingly! It was only a 30 minute wait which was great compared to the Cheesecake Factory next door which has a wait of 3 hours.  Our whole family was really satisfied with the food. The service is okay, it seemed they were really busy. It would take a while to get the attention of a waiter to help serve us."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken fajitas. Comes with TONS of condiments (sour cream , salsa, guacamole, shredded lettuce, several more) and skillet was very hot. Delicious, except they burned some of the chicken, but there was more than I could eat anyhow. Very friendly and prompt staff. Didn't have to wait for seating, but it was a Monday at about 5:45 pm. Right next door, the new Cheesecake Factory told us we'd have to wait 3 hours. This was a very satisfactory alternative."}
{"text":"Came here for a staff party of about 8 people. The food was decent, basically what you would expect from a large chain. The service however, was absolute crap.   We had to flag down our server for everything, and it would take him a while to get back to us. He wouldn't even fill up our waters unless we asked, didn't give us a jug of water either. Then a coworker of mine, while trying to flag him down, spotted him taking swigs of beer while on the job. Are you kidding me? Someone retrain the staff or at least keep an eye on them.   Another coworker of mine left early and paid for her bill, but wanted to pitch in for an appetizer someone else bought so she left $5 on the table. About an hour later when we were paying for ourselves, we realized the waiter took the $5 while clearing the table. By the way, tip was already included in all the bills because of our party size.  I don't know about you, but I sure love having an intoxicated, unobservant and tip greedy server. I really should've talked to management that night, but my coworkers didn't want to cause a ruckus. Never coming here again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"We had a really poor experience there yesterday. Party of 18, half the food orders were wrong when they came out. Manager did not know the difference between rye bread and challah. Drink orders were wrong. Understaffed and just overall a negative outing, would not go there ever again."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!   I'm a fan of Pickle Barrel and it's been awhile since I last visited but if this location is representative of the whole, then Pickle Barrel has really gone downhill.   First, we had to wait (along with 2 other couples) for what felt like 10 minutes for the hostess to emerge and lead us to our table. A number of waiters passed by in the meantime without reassuring (or even acknowledging) us that the hostess would be with us shortly.  Then, the Chicken Panini I was was served was cold. Really cold. It wasn't that it became cold; there weren't any signs of it ever being in a grill. It was warm on the edges but cold inside. The manager came and said that they would take care of that in the bill. They changed it to a somewhat warmer Panini that was delivered in less than 5 minutes. Did they microwave it? Although the meat was warm this time, it was still dry and tasteless.   Then we discovered quite a big egg shell in my wife's Feta Burger. Well, at least the burger was hot.   The only bright point was that the manager waived the bill, so all we wasted was our time and appetite (although, I reserve the right to update this post in case of a food poisoning later tonight)."}
{"text":"Great ambience, Plenty of choice to cater to every taste... all of this despite being in a mall. The Citrus Salmon (in a bowl) is recommended for being filling, yet adequately healthy. The Burger was good but a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"I was shopping with a friend so we stopped in for a small bite to eat for lunch. We chose Pickle Barrel because of the convenient location. We were seated quickly but the service from the waiter was a little slow.   We ordered deep fried pickles and the fish tacos. We also wanted just some pickles on the side like you'd get with a sandwich and were told they now charge for that. I thought that was a little odd considering we were ordering meals and I've asked for a few extra before and never been charged. Just seems like subpar customer service.   As far as food goes the deep fried pickles were good, they're actually the only reason I didn't rate a 2. Nice and crispy and good pickles inside. They gave us a good amount as well. However the fish tacos were a let down. I could have made better at home easily. One of my fish tacos was half batter with nothing inside and the toppings were nothing special. Kind of bland. The tortillas tasted raw like they weren't warmed up.   The waiter never came back after bringing the food so we didn't get a refill on our drinks and had to finish the meal thirsty. I don't expect to have to hunt down my server for a drink mid-meal. I felt like the waiter could care less about us. Turns out when we got the bill they charge 1.50 for 4 extra side pickles. Just disappointed all around, subpar service and food unless you only want an order of deep fried pickles."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. If you are seriously considering going here, don't do it. You will absolutely be disappointed. Food was served cold, service took forever. Three people had flat beer (they all ordered the same type) and when the manager showed up to check on this, she said she \"tried the beer\" and checked the tanks and they were fine. She actually thought she would convince them that the beer was ok and they were lying. Also she was about 8 months pregnant. I sincerely hope she didn't try the beer. In the end after a long and painful process they got new beers (bottles) and we moved on. Never again."}
{"text":"Although the Pickle Barrel (at least in Toronto) are now on a unified menu, and all their food pretty well tastes the same, I had three problems with this branch of the franchise: 1) Very low-rent decor, similar to cafeteria seating, not as nice as other PBs, 2) Very blase/uninterested service-people, 3) I got quite sick after the burger with feta. It tasted okay, but I was in the washroom for hours that night - I hadn't eaten anything else that day that could have been responsible, and I've had this meal before at other PBs. Oh well - I won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Amazing service every time!  I tried their mushroom and cheese gnocchi which was delicious. A bit salty the second time but I'd definitely go back!  Also good deals on drinks!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this restaurant is nothing special.  The menu is the same as every single other Canadian/American food restaurant in town and I think there are less items to choose from.  The prices are higher too.   The atmosphere is nice.    Staff is pleasant but service was so slow and it wasn't even busy while we were there!  I won't go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have lunch here yesterday. I would suggest strongly that the management should either re train or overhaul the front of house staff as soon as possible, that's if they care enough to keep their customers. The food was ok, nothing spectacular but perfectly fine and acceptable for lunch, the restaurant was clean, apart from some dirty dishes which remained on an adjacent table to us for at least twenty minutes or so. The restaurant was moderately busy, but relaxed and not chaotic so they were not rushed off their feet. There were four service staff on duty on the 18th of April 2017. Service was appalling and they didn't have a clue of how to treat customers. We arrived and waited to be greeted at the front door, but there was no body to greet us for about five minutes. Of course this should have been a warning sign and we should have walked on to somewhere else, but we were quite hungry at the time and so chose to overlook this. Eventually a young waiter came, pointed to a booth which was available for us, but did not physically walk with us to show us to our table, I thought this was bad customer service for a start. We ordered and drinks arrived. I had ordered a starter, which was unceremoniously dumped on the table by the waiter about fifteen minutes later as he walked past with a pile of dirty dishes in his other hand.....gee, thanks, I thought. Approximately forty five minutes after, our burgers arrived, seriously, I could have almost roasted a small chicken in that time. Along with having to overhear how tired the waiter was to his colleagues, we were never asked if anything was ok, did we require a desert, more drinks etc?......Although my husband had a top up of coffee randomly poured into his cup and I had to ask for a coffee, with which I got what appeared to be a \"huffy\" response. So we finished our burgers and waited to receive the bill, and we waited, and we waited. There was a button for service to press on the table with a choice of options. We pressed this twice for the bill, no one appeared. An older waiter walked past our table so I asked politely if we could have the bill, he said it would be right with us. We waited for another fifteen minutes, by which time I was furious. We had a forty minute drive back home and I really wanted to get home to continue with some business before the end of day and not get stuck in the late afternoon traffic, It was extremely frustrating. We got up from our table and waited at the front of the restaurant in the hope it would indicate further that we needed to go. There was not one member of staff in the restaurant and another customer had also stood up to try to find somebody.  A couple of minutes later, a young female waitress came from the kitchen with some soup for another table and I told her that if nobody moved their butt to take our payment within the next minute, we would be leaving. Hey, guess what......our waitor arrived with the card machine within seconds like a Genie from a lamp. There was no apology, which would have placated me somewhat, but a backhanded compliment of how he liked my jacket. It was in fact a blouse, which I could have quite cheerfully removed and used it at that point to slap him with. My advice to anyone shopping in Centerpoint Mall would be to avoid The Pickle Barrel at all cost and if you want a stress free lunch, just go to the food court to relax."}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch here on a Thursday afternoon. When we arrived the restaurant was not full although there were a few large parties. We were a party of three.  We were seated promptly. Our server was very sweet but seemed to be stretched a little thin as her appearances were very far and few between.  Our drink order was placed about 10 minutes after we were seated. Our drinks came quickly after the order was placed.  My boyfriend (who had eaten earlier but came for company) ordered a poutine. He said the gravy had a \"tangy\" taste to it that he did not really enjoy. But that could just be personal preference.  I ordered the BBBLT. Which was Apple Wood smoked bacon, back bacon, prosciutto, lettuce, tomato, avocado and a bacon aioli as a dressing.  The prosciutto was honestly inedible. It was like leather that had been salted for 10 years. I couldn't even chew it. There was no apple smoked bacon on it. When I asked the server she claimed she \"thought it was in the sauce\".  The bread was cut very unequally, the top bun was so thin it was falling apart, making the sandwich almost impossible to eat. Maybe I should of used the prosciutto to hold it together.  My friend ordered quesadilla with no chicken because she's a vegetarian. When it came, she took a bite and the immediately had to spit it out (ew) on her plate because it was loaded with chicken.  She got it sent back. The server was very apologetic and asked her if she was okay, which we truly appreciated. It took them quite awhile to bring her a new one, but when it arrived she said it was tasty. Everything was fresh and well made.  All in all, for the price we paid I can not post a good review. Pickle barrel is supposed to be a high quality, high profile restaurant and I feel like they did not perform to their potential today. I am very disappointed. Even though our server was a sweet heart, the service was slow due to understaffing. The food was not the quality I expected. The restrooms were not stocked properly with soap or paper towels.  I will unfortunately not be returning."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location when I live at Yonge and Lawrence. Now that i've moved I havent been there in a while. I came here 2 weeks ago with a girlfriend I haven't seen in ages! I REGRET COMING HERE!  The service was terrible. Our server ignored us the entire time, we had to ask other servers to get us refills on drinks and to order dinner and desserts! It was ridiculous. He was serving tables around and beside us but when he saw us hed just look away and go back into the kitchen. I was very upset.  I am not going back to this location!  Yonge and Dundas is muchhhh better location! **"}
{"text":"Very decent prices for an average meal with above average portions in a restaurant with a nice decor. The food is not bad but not great either. I would definitely come here to eat when I don't feel like eating at the food court."}
{"text":"I've always felt \"less is more\" when it comes to a menu. Their over-sized menu offers a boatload of dreck and few highlights; I've never been dazzled with any of the fare. The service at the Yonge and Eg locale is particularly egregious, and the wait is frequently quite long.  Obligatory Restaurant Pun: Finding fault with this place is like shooting fish in a BARREL.  Menu Readability: PB's menu is about as thick as a R.L. Stine novel and equally horrific.  Need to mention: I don't like this place. Don't eat here.  What this place teaches me about myself: I don't automatically love places with Pickle in the title."}
{"text":"If nothing else, you have to admire the consistency of Pickle Barrel's various offerings. You'll never walk out of a Pickle Barrel thinking you had an amazing, memorable meal, but, generally speaking, you're also not likely to have hated your food. It's almost always passable.  On this particular Sunday, I was meeting a few people around lunchtime, so I decided to go with the Craft Your Own Omelette option. I asked for mine with black forest ham, bell peppers, and onions, and also requested white toast and a mixed greens salad. (The dish also includes a small piece of pineapple and a small piece of melon.)  It's fine. The omelette is big and hearty, and the eggs were cooked relatively well. (The whole thing was oddly wet, though, so that was a little off-putting.) The veggies are included in the omelette raw, which seems like a bizarre choice, but whatever. The toast was served dry and unbuttered, and it might've been nice if an assortment of jams had been made available.  Strangely, the highlight of this meal was the mixed greens salad. It was topped with tasty toasted nuts and slices of apple, and the maple balsamic dressing is nothing short of delicious. I wish they'd sell that stuff by the bottle.  The service was above average, at least, and the meal was pretty cheap. But wouldn't it be amazing if one day you went to Pickle Barrel and it was more than mediocre?"}
{"text":"To be honest...this location is far superior to the one in Vaughan Mills and that to say that they're the same company should be considered blasphemous. This location has got the VM location beat on every aspect...especially in the service department. I met a friend for lunch on a Monday afternoon....at around 12:30pm. The restaurant was fairly quiet and ample searing was available. We were given a booth for 2, close to the entrance to the outside patio, and close to the bar. Our waiter was over a few minutes later and took our drink order. He made a few recommendations for lunch and off he went to get our drink order (a diet coke and an iced tea) He popped by several times in the next 1/2 hr to see if we were ready to order and when we finally did, he did all the right sells..bacon on that, Caesar salad instead of fries, gravey for the fries, etc. he was excellent. I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon with fries, my dining companion ordered a Club on flatbread with a Caesar salad. Food portion size was excellent....my GC was wonderfully flavored and the bacon (applewood bacon) added a nice smokiness to it. The fries were cooked perfectly. My friends salad was fairly large and her club was large. She couldn't finish her meal. We finished off with a coffee and tea. Total came to $35...good value for what we had. Great service, great food...I'll come back to this location."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, I was surprised to see the place filled with a few people being Halloween and all. Some of the servers were in the Halloween spirit (in costumes) while others weren't. Our server acknowledged us immediately and had loads of energy. He was quick in taking our first order of appetizers and drinks. We decided on the fried dills and the mac and cheese poppers. Both were delivered and presented in a very \"pleasing to the eye\" way. They were both great and exactly what I expected to get and I would recommend both to anyone who just wants a bit of \"classic old fashion\" eats.  For our main I went with the Chicken Chow Mein and my friend decided on the BBQ burger. One thing that was disappointing was my friend ordered it with no Coleslaw on the burger and the waiter looked at him with the puzzled look and said of course it comes on the side. Then of course when the burger came the coleslaw was on the side but also on the BURGER. It wasn't a huge deal my friend scraped it off and continued eating. After a few bites of mine I was completely stuffed. Couldn't put another bite in my mouth. I had tons left over and asked the waiter for it to go.   This is where my server went above and beyond. Most places that I go to bring me the containers and expected for me to do it myself.. anyone who knows me know I hate that!! It's so annoying because they should take care of the customer from start to finish. This guy did that and I was pleased to see that. It was a job well done on our servers part..   I enjoyed the night out from start to finish. Next time i'm shopping at the mall and looking for a place to eat, I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch yesterday. Was seated right away and the server we had was friendly. We ordered off of the breakfast menu. It was okay. The eggs lacked some flavour (needed salt). My boyfriend also had some hair at the bottom of his eggs (so gross) but we were done eating by the time he found it we didn't bother saying anything."}
{"text":"Service slow, food only ok.  Decor dated and ambience kind of crusty.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my friend. Arrived at around 2pm. First impressions of the restaurant was it looked like a Denny's express in the mid west United States. Server asked for drink orders as we were being seated. We would need a minute. Server comes back takes our order and tells us he ran out of fruit billinis, he ran out of white freezie cocktails too. Okay just bring us beer. The beer tasted like piss water. Order food; server says they've run out of chicken and waffles. Okay, a bit frustrated I asked if we could have a couple mins to decide. 30 seconds later a random server comes.over and asks if there is a problem or if he could help us. I explained that they didn't have what we wanted and we needed a minute, is there a problem? \"NO its fine\" he snaps and walks away. Our server returns 20 seconds later and takes our order of a bunch of appetizers  (4 to be exact, Inc nachos, tacos, etc). Food takes forever but is fine. However server NEVER RETURNS. Never comes back to ask if everything is okay. NOTHING!!! now my friend and I can chat for days so we pass the time talking but realize it's now 5pm and no one had come back to ask if we need more drinks, do we need the bill, anything??? I wanna go home, as soon as we stand up to put on our jackets. Our server SHOUTS FROM ACROSS THE RESTAURANT \"I'll bring your bill!!!!!!!!!\" And returns with a bill. \"Can..we..have..separate bills man?\" I ask. He seemed huffy. What an ordeal for him. never going back here again. What a headache."}
{"text":"This place apparently imports their water from the French Alps because good luck on getting yourself a glass (of water.) I asked twice - the water never came. Now, it should be known that going into a big food chain like this, there are certain meals you should just leave to speciality restaurants. (e.g: Ordering a curry dish.) I got the brilliant idea to order the fajitas; this seemed easy enough to not screw up -- was I ever wrong. The rice was bland, the chicken tasted reheated, the shredded cheese had formed into a ball, the salsa was runny and flavourless. Our waitress failed to do any quality control check; my boyfriend's father ordered breakfast, they forgot his bacon and the 'toast' was cold and still soft. Upon asking, the bacon arrived ten minutes later as did the bread - still cold, still untoasted. Save your money and find a new food chain restaurant to give your money to, 'cause this one isn't it."}
{"text":"How this place still exists is a shock.  The place was practically empty at 5:30 yet they sat us right next to a birthday party that arrived 10 minutes after we were seated. When we asked, we were told they had a lot of reservations and thats why they sat ud there.  What a load of crap.  In the hour we were there, perhaps 3 other tables were filled.  But the worst was the food which not only took forever but was inedible.  Here is a restaurant that used to be known for its brisket but not only did we wait half an hour for it after being told it was not ready a few times, when it came it was cold and chewy.  So we couldn't eat it. To make matters worse the side veggies of cauliflower and broccoli were raw!   While the waiter was nice enough, he could have advised the manager rather than apologizing to us over and over. Not his fault but the kitchen's. Haven't been to the PB for years.  This confirmed it. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My friends and I came around 9:30pm. The server we had a large group of 8-10 people that came in after my group of friends. Besides that we were the only other table. Waited close to 30mins just to get our beverages and yet another 20 for small apps. When finally getting our bills waited so long just to get our server to get the bills. Food was mediocre and didn't save the poor service I received."}
{"text":"Though the menu is huge and claims to have \"something for everyone\", by the same token you really have to know to order. Not everything is good.  As a rule of thumb, stay away from pastas as they tend to be overcooked. Barbeque chicken tends to be dry as well.  However, anything from the deli is always delicious. Try ordering the deli plate it won't disappoint!  Service is always a hit or a miss here. Servers quit all the time so they're constantly fielding newbies with little or no experience in the biz and it shows."}
{"text":"They just changed their menu (which is fine) but don't know how to cook the new items.  Went for brunch and ordered sausages and on the outside they looked fully cooked. They were completely raw.  Thankfully I noticed before ate it.  They did deduct it from my bill and give me a discount but that freaked me out. What else do they not k ow how to cook?"}
{"text":"Used to be a hip and creative food joint but now it's just a regular restaurant that serves overpriced and unsatisfying food. Texas sandwich is acceptable but avoid the curry (it feels like a microwave dinner)."}
{"text":"I could not believe the state of the washrooms on Thursday evening. I had to check every single stall before I found one that was near acceptable. There was exactly ONE semi clean washroom. I witnessed a lady bend down and pick up toilet paper scraps from the ground to use because there was zero toilet paper I'm the entire washroom. I'm so disgusted. Also took forever to get our bill. The food is mediocre. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This chain is usually hit and miss with both food and service but this particular does quite well in both categories. Their service is top notch and their food is consistent in quality and taste. Their drink menu is fairly good with a variety of choices. We usually do a dinner/movie and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"There are two things to know before you go to Pickle Barrel. 1) The menu is long and extensive 2) So are their meals ... If you're not sure what you want to eat you should go here because they'll probably have something to satisfy your hunger with. On the downside, if you go here hungry and don't know what you want to eat you'll probably eat everything you order and be full for the next 3 days.   What I can recommend right off the bat without thinking are a few things that I know are good... they aren't in a specific order just what I can think about off the top of my head. I should note though that the menu can be scary to go through because it's a little TOO long.   1) Chicken Fingers..either with fries or their Greek Salad... this is a classic and you can't go wrong..so if you want to be safe this is good.  2) Greek Salad... you can have it for yourself or share it with the table as an appetizer... **Warning this salad is REALLY big  3) Luau Salad... really nice summer salad  4) PB Sliders  5) Avocado Turkey Club... this is ridiculously good  6) Waffle with fresh berries or banana served with frozen yogurt  7) BBQ Haven... really big meal and really good..   During the week I think on Tuesday they have cheap Bellini's so it's can be nice to go for lunch or dinner... if Bellini's are your thing..and their martini's are really strong at this location. I know random ordering a martini at pickle barrel but if you're looking something that's going to hit you over a meal I'd suggest PB.   Every time I've been at the Yonge and Eg location the service has been great.   Also if you park in the mall you can get your parking validated."}
{"text":"First of all a restaurant needs to clean and second of all pills shouldn't be laying around I personally work in a restaurant but this is the first I don't realize we can do this in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"excellent bellini & calamari! the service is superb! the only thing is the wifi wasn't working but other than that it's perfection!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed with the food and dessert. Having been going to PB for many years with family and friends. Always loved their spinach dip (no longer available) ordered the lobster mini tacos. The shell was soft and bland didn't do justice for the filling.  The steak was dry and chewy. My all time fave seafood linguine tasted different than what I had remembered it to be and I know this dish cause I order it 9 out 10 visits. The seafood was sparse and the dish wasn't even hot.  The three chews gnocchi in sundried tomato sauce was really tart and the gnocchi wasn't very tasty.  The sausage penne was really not that good. The new item of grilled beef and mushrooms was actually the best dish. The meat was tender., mushroom nicely cooked, mash was tasty and the baked slice of squash was really nice.   The mini desserts were 2.99 each and was really not a hit among our group. They were small therefore pricey and taste either to sweet or not sweet a enough.   This location I guess got another facelift therefore was real nice and modern looking. However. I am unsure as to whether I would return since my favourite dish doesn't taste the same anymore. Maybe I will give it another chance to try other selection."}
{"text":"The food and serve is very good, the dishes are a bit different from the typical chain restaurant types and the plating was beautiful but one thing i must say is that its a bit on the pricey side. for one large caesar salad with chicken it cost me $16!..call me cheap but I think thats a bit much for some lettuce and grilled chicken. Other than that the food and service were good."}
{"text":"Spacious, clean and consistent for the pickle barrel.  Always good food and friendly staff.  Had the  Fried Calamari ( thick slices al dente ) Fried mac n cheese poppers blue cheese burger,  Mushroom swiss burger, Turkey burger Berry Quinoa salad  Paella on a bed mussels   Fruit flies flying near the table so be wary."}
{"text":"There are Pickle Barrels all around town.  This has to be my worst experience so far.  Can't give them a total fail but I won't be going back there anytime soon. The service is slow with less than half capacity.  The place is in disarray and maybe they need to look inwards and make some changes. I was there with my wife, Mom, and Mom-in-law for an early dinner.  I swear, as we get older, I think Dinner goes from 6-7PM-ish to 4PM-ish! The Ginger Chicken Bites appetizer was horrid - overly salty and no other flavours.  The Moroccan Cigars were not worth the price I paid - especially when we all know it's a frozen mid-east spring roll that they deep fry.  I only ordered it since I haven't tried them in any place for a long time. The entrees fair no better.  The striploin was overcooked - basically well done and then some.  So they took attempt #2 at it - came out medium well in some places and well done in other spots.  Don't they thaw the meat before they cook?  Do they even know what Medium is?  I know, what the heck was I doing ordering a steak at PB?  Not my idea, I did recommend against it but they are Moms - and they are always right! The Seafood Linguine was passable - a little too creamy though.  The Montreal Smoke Meat was really fatty - way more than usual.  The Matzoball was dry even drowned in the soup - how?!?!?! Never had this issue at Centrepoint Mall.  Next time someone wants to go to a pseudo-deli, we're driving a bit further and avoiding this PB = Pretty Bad! 1.5 stars!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"After multiple trips and getting less and less service and quality, I have basically thrown in the towel with this place.  The last time I checked in, I got food that was less than desirable - I did post an unflattering photo of brown lettuce for a salad, and being charged a $1 per slice of bread - and service from people in off the street hoodies.   This time was breakfast.  No salads and toast is included!  Bonus right!?!  Nope!  Didn't even get to breakfast.  Coffee came, it was horrible!  Brown liquid with no flavour...not even a hint that it was coffee!  It felt like they took the coffee grinds from last day and re-ran it - and to make sure it's hot, they added more hot water!  OK...maybe not, but it sure was tasteless.  The whole fam turned their nose up at it.  A \"new\" pot was offered and we gladly took it.  Well...Same results - flavourless, aroma-less, watery mess.  On top of that, the server from the start treated the customers like annoyances.  The fam and I just upped and walked out.  If coffee is this bad, breakfast must be atrocious.  I can go really deep into all that but I don't want to risk CARPAL TUNNEL SYDNROME on it!  Suffice it to say that their low rating is for a reason.  They better do a massive shake up with their management team because they are losing lifetime customers like me.  Think about it, I was going to the Atrium on Bay location when I was in my early university days.  I don't want to \"carbon date\" myself but that was eons ago.  I have been a client for decades and I am thoroughly frustrated with what has become of a good go to place.  No customary Cheers for this one!  Jeers!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked this gets such poor ratings.  Each time I've been here for brunch I've had a great meal and experience.  It's a franchise restaurant peeps. Family type restaurant, not expensive prices, to level the expectations.  They have an awesome all day breakfast menu and I've had many items on it and they do it very well.  My favourite soup there is the Matzo ball....love it!  Their early bird breakfast is tasty as well as the PB big breakfast or even with wake and bacon.  Their bacon  is applewood smoked so a sweet maple taste which is really nice.  Eggs are always good here, many options of toast, all in all a solid hearty breakfast. Also they have free WIFI here which is pretty convenient.  This is one of my go to places for brunch or a quick lunch and they have never disappointed me.  Try it out peeps!"}
{"text":"It's close to work so it seems we are coming here more often than I would like for lunch social activities. New jobs, good bye lunches, birthdays, etc. This is because if the extensive menu, you'll find something you'll probably eat on it.  It's funny but by saying \"We are going to pickle barrel\" everyone knows its a two hour lunch regardless of how many people are going.  The building looks really great, modern, classy, and like all pickle barrels with a proper patio, amazing. Best patio in Newmarket, hands down! Lots of plants, palms, comfy seats. Love. Plenty of free parking as well.  Inside it looks great too. Modern, stylish, attractive, and welcoming. Tables, booths, table/ booth hybrids, bar seats. Nice lighting, and there are televisions so you can eat and watch sports.  The service is consistent. Consistently bad. There have been times where et have had excellent service, but that is the exception. You can understand sometimes. Sometimes at lunch its crazy busy and OK, its slow, but after work when there's 4 tables? No excuse having to wait 20 minutes to order, drinks that never come, 35 minutes to get a bill...  Food is good. Well except when it's not. It really depends on who is working. I love the breakfast hash. Great most times. I have discovered they used frozen sweet potatoes when I got a skillet of partially thawed potatoes. Another time the egg they tossed on top was too runny, the whites weren't set. I can't eat that because I don't like it. The potatoes were just warmer than room temp. So I sent it back for further frying. Didn't get it back untill everyone had finished eating and paid. Had to stay behind. Took it to go. Got to the office. The hash was cold and soggy and the egg was really cooked. Rubbery hard yolk. A friend got a raw uncooked Turkey burgers on a bun one time.  So what I'm saying is you get bad service and inconsistent food. When it's good, its great, when it's not, watch out."}
{"text":"I will only give this place two star because the food was pretty okay. I got a caesar salad to start and then fish and chips as my entree. It was all quite tasty.  The waiter took a bit of time to get our drinks. He did the bare minimum. Got our orders and then brought the drinks and food. He checked up on us perhaps once. My friends and I got there in time for their special that had a soup or salad and main entree. It said on the menu to add a mini dessert for $1.99. I was definitely surprised when I was charged $2.99. When I asked him about it he hesitated and then told me it was the correct price. My friend said it was fine and paid for our meals. I knew I was not wrong so after dinner we went to the washroom and looked at the menu by the hostess station. It was indeed $1.99. I was not happy at all. Customer service was not a strong suit of the waiter.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This review is a bit late from the actual date as I wanted the give the company a chance to \"step up to the plate\" and deliver per say, but nope..the chain/management and even the executive assistant to the president have fallen short of what customer service is and what is should be.  On December 15th, myself with my family (4 of us) along with another family of 4 and my sister in law dined here.  We had an assortment of different dishes, ranging from hamburgers for all the children (4 of them) and also my sister in law had the burger, my buddy and I had the ribs dish and my wife had the fajita dish.  About 16-18 hours later not all, but most of us were incapacitated for the majority of Saurday the 16th.  I took myself and children to the walk in clinic for diarrhea and vomiting, where based on our symptoms we were diagnosed with food poisoning or at best food cross contamination.  My sister in law was also sick and had diarrhea and vomiting.  My buddy's wife and her 2 children also had the same types of issues and were up in the early morning dealing with vomit and other things.  I took this issue up with the manager at the yorkdale location, were he seems genuine and took our conversation very seriously.  I was instructed to write what i had told him to head office.  I did that and 3 days later i was written a wonderful note that they hope we feel better and, I wish I could say that they basically wiped their hands of any wrong doing, but instead that is exactly what they did and said in the letter, explaining how they triple check everything, double check everything else and there is no way that they could of gotten us sick.  I wrote back stating there is no way of knowing for certain after first of all checking for anything wrong 2 days later that any food that was bad already wasn't consumed and any workers that were working that evening were working again the day of the check, but to no avail.  I even asked if they have camera's in the staffs washrooms, because after all they may have vigorous hand washing policies but who's to say the staff actual wash their hands after using the restroom.  There is like everything else about this story, room for error and also room to understand that as a restaurant chain there is always going to be room for something to go wrong, no matter how obsessed you are with making sure no one gets hurt or sick.  Rather than offer us some type of compensation we were shut down and the Pickle barrel's medical opinion over turned my doctors.  Case closed.  In replying, I also did mention that i would write this review, and many more on all my food review sites, and also take this to the media, and not for any compensation because i wouldn't eat there again even for free, but if I can save one person from going there and getting sick I have then done my job.    You can read any of my reviews, and there are many and you can see what is takes for a place to get anything close to even 3 stars..it would need to be a complete disaster but yet these guys got a 1 star, and if I could would of given them a -1.  Just a complete lack of acknowledgment that they could be in the wrong and it made us sick.  Complete lack of professionalism on the part of the head office and more importantly a complete lack of customer service from the restaurant itself, offering me a free appetizer if I return for all my troubles....HAHA  troubles....no troubles at all...cleaning up barf and diarrhea all night and then missing our plans for the following day..trouble...pheffff..not at all.  Shame on you Pickle Barrel for even trying to say it wasnt you...is that your way of staying out of a lawsuit???    Your in the food business...just because you feel no one has ever gotten sick from your food....I think would like to think that there are many..maybe not all reported like that same night but there are many.  Do yourself a favor and stand in the 5 hour line for the cheese cake factory..the 5 hours you waste in line will offset the 4 hours your will spend on the toilet and in the doctors office the next day anyway!"}
{"text":"I called on Pickle Barrel for reservations for a party of 17... there was a little bit of a back and forth over whether they could accomodate, but was advised they could in the end.  I was only providing 3 days notice, so that's fair.   Our table for 17 was ready on time, they provided two servers for our table which was great.  We had some young kids with us, so it was a little chaotic at times, but they didn't seem to mind.  (it wasn't out of control or anything).  Service was good... food was good.... okay.  Nothing knocked my socks off, but it was good. I personally find the menu a little too large, takes a while to even go through the whole thing.   Overall, a good experience.  I would go back.  Decor is nice... kids menu is good, and overall good value I think."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We went on a Sunday Morning so it was not busy.  We must have waited 25 minutes before  someone even took our drinks order so we gave both food and drink orders when they came by. After that, it was a further 15 minutes before we received our drinks and then what must have been 10 later until we received our food.  Once we had finished we was left sat there for another 30 minutes before we had the chance to ask for the bill, then what must have been another 15 minutes before we got it. It's a shame because I really enjoyed my breakfast. I have the hat trick, three eggs, sausage, bacon and pea meal with pancakes and these awesome potato fritter things. Everything tasted great and my eggs where made perfectly.  I just hope this place one day matches the quality of the kitchen to the quality of service ."}
{"text":"Went there with a few of my friends with children. They were very accommodating with the children and gave us a bigger table with room for strollers and high chairs. I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich with fries, and the portion was very generous, the toppings on the sandwich complimented each other very well. My husband had a breakfast special which was also very large and the portion was generous. We ordered a kid's meal for my toddler, and the chicken fingers were made from scratch with real chicken breast, it came with a drink and also a sundae. The only downfall is that it was pricey and we wound up paying almost $50 for 2 adults and a child for lunch. I would recommend this place for families though."}
{"text":"So happy that the Pickle Barrel has finally graced it's presence by opening a location in the Durham region. I have been long awaiting this addition to the Pickering Town Centre (note it's not actually connected to the town  centre but located behind it on Liverpool).   My family visited this restaurant on Tuesday afternoon just after 3pm. We were kindly greeted upon entering. The restaurant just had a few tables full at this time so we got to pick whichever table we wanted. We picked a long table in the centre of the restaurant against a tall banquet. The backside of the restaurant has a wall of tall windows looking onto the street and the high industrial ceilings make the restaurant feel very airy and bright.  After being seated our waitress came over with the menus and introduced herself she let us know of the specials for the day and took our drink orders. When she returned with our drinks we were ready to order.   Surprisingly our food was prepared and ready pretty quickly but then again the restaurant was not very full.  The Great Reuben - Grilled marble rye, pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing. It was quite a large sandwich, cut in thirds, the meat was hot, tender and tasty, cheese was gooey and melty, the bread was nicely grilled and toasted to keep everything together and it never got soggy even with the sauerkraut. A very filling sandwich indeed. I upgraded my side to Sweet potato fries which was a good portion and very crispy and also came with a simple chipotle aioli for dipping.  Hubby got the Classic Beef burger which is served on a brioche bun and he added bacon and cheese. He said his burger was really good and also surprised that it had a double patty. He also upgraded his side to onion rings which although he only got about 7 or 8 onion rings they were really thick and hearty which a golden brown crispy coating.  For dessert we wanted to get cappuccinos however the waitress apologized and said the machine was out of order. Thankfully I also ordered a cheesecake.  Brown Cow Cheesecake - Rich chocolate cheesecake with milk chocolate chip cheesecake patches, finished with a whipped cream topping and chocolate drizzle. Absolutely loved this creamy cheesecake, just the right balance of sweetness from the chocolate and tanginess from the cream cheese, I adored the combination of chocolate cheesecake with the chunks of chocolate chip cheesecake mixed in and the crunchy chocolate shell drizzle on top. I thought I was too full to finish it but it was soo good I couldn't resist leaving a crumb behind.   Overall I have to say we had a great time. Our waitress was very kind, always checking on us to make sure we were ok or if we needed anything. Our meals were perfectly cooked, and came out pretty quickly, good sized portions, and were nice and hot. I look forward to returning to this restaurant and am Happy it has finally opened in the Pickering area."}
{"text":"First off I should say I am a Fan of the Pickle Barrel......so maybe this review is bias but anywho I can't say I've ever had a bad experience at PB before either......and I do enjoy going through there gigantic plastic coil bounded novel they call a menu.  At this Location I love that its high up so ask for a cozy booth by the window so you can peek out at the frantic pedestrians running around on yonge street.   Service wise we had an amazing waitress named Lenny. She was soo bubbly and sweet and made our dining experience worth coming back. If you come ask to be seated in Lenny's section and i'm sure you won't be disappointed.  After flipping back and forth through menu we settled on two appetizers the Crispy Fried Calamari and the Risotto Balls.  The calamari was absolutely delicious cooked perfectly and nice and crispy and they gave a hefty portion too. It's served with lemon and a chipotle aioli which we kicked it up a notch with some tabasco sauce. Super yummy!  The risotto balls were a little disappointing at first because when we cut into them they were sort of cold in the centre. We alerted are lovely waitress and she gracefully took it away and said she'll take care of it. Within minutes she brought us back a steaming portion and they were nice and hot but not burn your mouth hot. They were perfectly crunchy but smaller than traditional risotto balls but I really enjoyed the chunky tomato sauce it was served on.  For mains I had the Pulled Brisket Sandwich which is served on a brioche bun and topped with crispy fried onions and served alongside sweet potatoe fries. A typical brisket sandwich and sweet potatoe fries, not mind blowing but still delicious and no complaints.  For dessert the crispy crunch and reeses peanut butter sundae jumped out at me so I had to have it! However when it arrived it wasn't what I expected. First of all PB does NOT serve real ice cream in any of there desserts, instead they serve frozen vanilla yogurt but I knew this already from past experiences at PB. However besides no real ice cream this sundae was just lacklustre, it was frozen yogurt piled with too much whipped cream with a light dusting of crispy crunch and far too much reeses pieces....if it were reeses peanutbutter cups I may have enjoyed it more but it wasnt.......and slim to none chocolate sauce.  Overall service was top notch that night....a water glass never went unfilled, Lenny checked up on us and wrapped our leftovers, provided us gracious and courteous service with a warm smile and cheerful attitude. Food was hit or miss but the portions a hugeee and affordable plus the menu is sooo grand its worth coming back to! Trust me after one visit your know if you are a PB fan or not.......but I still AM! :-)"}
{"text":"I went to this location and ordered the 10z New York Striploin, the steak meat when i cut it was bright blue in color and looked like meat was bad, when i complained about it, the manager comes up to me and tells me \"this happens when the animals are hurt and the ligaments are damaged\" and she insisted she had seen it with chicken too. To be honest ive never seen blue meat. They did not charge me for it, but I'm definitely never going back here."}
