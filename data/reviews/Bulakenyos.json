{"text":"I seldom cook and I often go here almost every other day. They have good food and give you good portion . You get your moneys worth compare to other Filipino restaurants around the area ."}
{"text":"Okay food not salty like most .. had beef calderetta and pork singing .. took home Kare   Kare and palabok .. it is mostly take out with hardly any space to eat in .. not sure the hours of operation one sign says 11 to 8 and another says 11 to 7 .. they are planning to open a larger fine dining location not sure where yet .. most of their food is served from the kitchen and not on display"}
{"text":"RATING FOR TAKEOUT/DELIVERY Our office frequently orders take out and delivery from this place. They have the friendliest staff, make sure to chat them up and make friends for VIP treatment.  They really know how to wrap up their take out/delivery orders to prevent spillage: aluminum tray, covered in plastic or aluminum foil, and even a cardboard box for easier transport (please see pic). Favorites of our office are:  - Fried Chicken - Pork BBQ - Caldereta  - Lechon Kawali - Lumpia Shanghai"}
{"text":"Really authentic Filipino chef, IMO. Must order: Pork spring rolls. Caldereta dishes. Menudo. Adobo. Lechon kawali was crispy and juicy!  Tosilog (all day breakfast) was not very good; home-made pork tocino.  Well-priced."}
{"text":"Ordered Lumpia shanghai, pork menudo, chop suey and pansit bihon to go for a party we were having. Overall food was good except for the pansit. Not my fave version of it. Lumpia was filled well and tasty, pork menudo was good too and chop suey was just ok. We had lots of left overs... Will probably not order there again as I have had better filipino food elsewhere but food portions are generous in general and good experience. Worth giving it a shot as everyone's tastes are different."}
