{"text":"We went in today to get out of the cold and to warm up with some coffee, tea, and churros. The service was very lovely! Workers are very friendly, environment is quiet and customers are mostly seniors."}
{"text":"Pupusas ordered here today were made fresh in front of my eyes while old folks puttered in and were greeted by name by the wry-smiling ladies behind the counter. There is coffee piled in sacks around the roaster, and a list of prices on the fair trade beans along the wall. I believe this is a coffee co-op of some sort.   The decor is minimal with a sweet mural, lots of plasticized pictures and prices of food. A glass counter with a few salads and pastries, a big window facing out onto Beaubien that gets fogged up on cold days. Hard, simple tables and chairs, brightly lit. A nicely neighbourly spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for breakfast and both ordered a breakfast dish that was supposed to come with corn tortillas. We verified a couple times that the tortillas would be corn and not flour. When they came they were in fact flour. We told our waiter I couldn't eat them and he told us he would try to look for corn tortillas but seemed uncertain that he would actually find any. He came back and told us he couldn't find any but that they were going to make some for us if we didn't mind waiting a bit. The woman in the kitchen came out smiling showing us that she was making them by hand. After finishing most of our breakfast the tortillas finally came out and it was completely worth the wait! The woman who was making them seemed to get a kick out of how much we loved them so she kept bringing more and more, maybe about 6 in total. She also brought us more beans and cheese so that we had something to go with them. Overall a great experience!"}
