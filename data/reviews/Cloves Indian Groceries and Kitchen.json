{"text":"I placed a food order through phone for pick up. They said it would be ready in about 20 mins and I reached the store in time to pick up the food. They said it would take another 10 mins, it wasn't even busy but I agreed to wait. After waiting for almost 15 minutes more I went and followed up. They were confused as if my order was never received. The guy at the counter told someone else took my order so it would take additional 10 mins. At this point I was really annoyed because I don't understand how someone else can take my order. After almost 35 mins of wait I got my food and it wasn't even hot. Completely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This store of Indian groceries is newly set and they have wide range of Indian brands filled in their racks for now.We have been going to Lotus from past 2 years and now I feel , this store is better organised and also a better version ."}
{"text":"Hello guys,  Lately I have been hearing really bad reviews on food they have in the kitchen, people from work, outside and myself. Firstly there Non-veg food ,( Meat is expired) and bubbles come out of the gravy.  Secondly Veg food (Idli, Paneer, vada, Daal, Saambar) is just Awful with an A, is not fresh. They have now expired food on shelves ( Maggie and Yogurt).  A sincere advice to people who prefer healthy, fresh food, Please DO NOT shop at cloves."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of groceries. Although,their customer service isn't the best and their food is not good. The lady taking our order said each meal takes 15 min. We ordered a dosa and it came cold."}
{"text":"2 stars - Why??  Ordered - Panner 65: looked blood red. Food color makes me go crazy. Tasted good, but was really really oily. . please refer to my pic below. Onion Uthappam : again it's really oily. Couldn't finish one dosa. Maybe batter has food soda in it. Poornam : supposed to be sankranthi special, but was served cold. While I eat them, a fresh batch came out and I could have waited for 2 mins to eat hot fresh Poornam. Looks like they don't give a shit about customers, and it goes likewise.  Probably not visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I am rating 2.5 stars but rounding off to 3. We came across new Indian grocery store in Chandler and we had to give it a try considering the number of options available in the valley.   The place is pretty organized and arranged well, it is clean and tidy. They also have a small restaurant as a part of the store.  We found some fresh pulses which is not easily available. One can find authentic gongura leaves (Roselle/ Hibiscus cannabinus) , thotakura leaves (Malabar Spinach) and other Indian veggies too. We also ordered samosa chat and punugulu. The service was very slow and we had to wait for half an hour get our order. The taste was average and wouldn't suggest for the wait time.   Overall I am removing two and half stars for the restaurant wait time and the taste of the food. Mainly the cost of the groceries, the scarcity is understandable but hiking the price doesn't help either. Also, comparing other Indian grocery market in the valley the price is a little more on the higher side."}
{"text":"Range of Vegetable selection is good and Fresh  Food is also a real deal. Very quite and neatly maintained. Glad to have it in Chandler:)"}
{"text":"Groceries are IN-expensive now .Store is big and neat"}
{"text":"This is a great place- they have a wide variety of items in stock from fresh produce to imported English chocolate! The cafe is a great addition; the curry is delicious! I will certainly be back!"}
