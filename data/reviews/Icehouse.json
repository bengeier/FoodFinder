{"text":"I have never been so disappointed by the service in my entire life. I had been to this place once before and it was fine, but the second time around, it was terrible!!! Our waiter was rude. When we ordered a beer, a coke, and a glass of water, he snarkily responded, \"Oh yeah, part-tay!\" We were there with a person who had a food allergy and we asked him for a suggestion of what he could order, and the watier responded in a very dismissive manner. \"Just tell me what you want to eat,\" he said. When we mentioned that two of us were planning to share a bucket of chicken, he suggested we go for the large version. Now neither my friend nor I are Jabba the Hutt, so there was no way in hell two people could finish so much chicken. He then forgot to place our order and left without telling us he was switching servers. We had to order again after 30 minutes and when the food did come, it was giant baseballs of chicken and they were thrown unceremoniously on the table on a brown paper mat. There were two measly halves of a biscuit thrown in with the chicken, and when we bit into one of them, we noticed that it had the consistency of chewing gum and realized that it was still raw. We thought that they were apologizing by giving us a discount on the chicken (charging us for the small bucket rather than the large), but after we paid, our waitress realized that she had mixed up our order with someone else's. We were then forced to pay for this disgusting bucket of chicken.  Wouldn't recommend this to even Jabba the Hutt!

{"text":"We made a quick stop for Father's Day to sample a couple of items and it was D-Licious
The place is small and old fashioned; picnic tables, no tablecloths, roll of brown paper for napkins (very useful!!) opt for the terrace if possible

1st off that Bourbon Lemonade is addictive, too bad i was driving 'cause i would've taken a whole pitcher!!

The pulled pork taco was great and that crunch (fried onions?) made it even better
The star of the night was the fried chicken!!! God it's good, just enough skin with a tangy spice, just amazing. it's served with a fantastic potato salad and a good old coleslaw.
The only unsatisfying item was the shrimp taco that lacked some oomphff!! i would of like the shrimp more fried but the spicy sauce gave it a good kick

Service was super, very fast and attentive. nice going gals!!

will definetely go back for other types of tacos, po-boys AND fried chicken and will bring a DD for my pitcher of Lemonade!!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Never disappointed, accept when you can't get a table cuz it's so small but so popular. My favourite is the popcorn shrimp and any tacos."}
{"text":"I use yelp a lot for restaurant/bar recommendations....I have never taken the time to write my own review...but, unfortunately, I'm going to now.  I'm in Charlotte from out of town, went to the Icehouse for drinks (did not order any food).  THIS WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST BAR SERVICE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!! The outside bar was NOT busy, but our service was slow, and sooooo rude.  Chelsea ( the outside bartender) was clearly wasted.  Spent her time at the end of the bar talking to her friend.  Dropped, and broke, a whole,.bottle of vodka behind the bar then ran a lap around the parking lot ( not joking, she did).  She was so rude to all of the patrons as they asked for their checks ( not just us) .. .....everyone, apparently interrupting her socializing with her friends at the other end of the bar.  Sooooooooo.....food might be good here....INSIDE bartender is probably fine, but if you are there and Chelsea is trending bar....good luck to ya."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the South, the food does not compare well with the BBQ I grew up with.  TeX Mex was marginal at best.  Ridiculous price for a tiny pour of bourbon.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Icehouse takes the meaning of \"a bucket of chicken\" to a whole new level... because it literally comes in an actual bucket - a metal one, not one made of cardboard that will eventually turn see-through. Thin battered crispy fried chicken covered with a couple of hot sauce shakes. The chicken was juicy and really soft, which leads me to believe that they were sitting in a vat of buttermilk before they met their impending fry-o-lator doom.

One friend had the lobster burrito. This thing was the size of her head. Stuff with generous chunks of lobster, corn, homemade corn chips, black beans and drenched in a tarragon aoli, The burrito was the size of a football... if the football was the size of a Nalgene bottle. I had a bite of it and it was really delicious. I really enjoyed the crunch from the chips against the bite of lobster. My friend made it a point to tell us how good it was because she said it after every bite, and made these faces that even *I* felt violated for the burrito."}
{"text":"Bourbon lemonade was outta this world, as was the food.   It's tiny, so expect a wait, especially if you're with a group."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! We ordered the popcorn shrimp, clam stuffed jalapenos, pulled pork tacos  and lobster burritos. Oh and of course, some bourbon lemonade. I would have licked the plate had their been anything left. Service was A+, everyone was quick and efficient. But be prepared to wait, we waited between 30-40 mins on a Wednesday night for a table for two."}
{"text":"Tried Icehouse out on a Saturday college football afternoon.  It wasn't crowded at all, which made for a pleasant trip.  The staff was accommodating for us, to choose an easy spot for a wheelchair. 

Our waitress left quite a bit to be desired.  Drink order -- 5 minutes later with drinks.  We need a minute -- 15 minutes later before coming back for our order.  She kept going over to the other end of the bar and chatting it up with other staff.  She only came back to check on us once (even though I kept seeing her looking over toward us.  Thanks for not refilling my drink).

The food was \"eh\"...kinda glorified bar food.  My daughter got a quesadilla, and it sure wasn't worth the price charged.  I got a jerk wrap that was pretty marginal, and hubby got pulled pork sliders that really had no taste to them at all.

If you want a nice big place to go watch a lot of sports and drink, this might be the place for you.  If you want to find somewhere with a great drink selection and a great menu to go with it, you might want to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great selection but super packed. A bit pricey for what it is. They could not give each of us our specific bill so we had to split the total collective bill equally among us. Very annoying."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the drinks were mediocre at best. 

We shared several tacos and burritos. The shrimp poppers are delicately sauced and were a great way to start the meal. The lobster burrito was definitely the highlight. It was a bit expensive compared to the rest of the menu, but 100% worth it.

So, I would have given this place 5 stars if I had ordered a Pepsi. However, we got the Bourbon Lemonade. Essentially, we paid $50 for a pitcher of Wild Turkey and sourmix. Major disappointment.

The atmosphere is hip and the service was quick and personal. The decor was authentic and, but for the weather, you wouldn't know you were in French Canada.

Long story short, if you are near St. Laurent, eat there but don't drink there."}
{"text":"We went to watch the Michigan/Michigan State and South Carolina/Alabama game.  It's a great sports bar to watch football as they have many TVs with different games playing.  The beer selection is awesome, but I was disappointed in the service and the food.  Service was very slow. . .not for drinks, but for food.  The food itself was just okay.  I looked for what I thought would be a healthy option and ordered the Garbanzo Bean burger.  Shouldn't be bad, right?  WRONG.  It is fried.  I was SO disappointed.  Who serves a veggie bean burger fried?  I may go back again to watch football, but if I'm hungry. . .I'll look for other options."}
{"text":"Just came back from the Icehouse and it was amazing.
We had trouble finding it at first since its really small and not well indicated.  Luckily, we found it and got a table. 
The place is soooooo small! it has 4 large picnic tables, 3 small tables made for two people and counter space.  Super quaint and super cute though. 
To drink, i had a bourbon lemonade....... SO GOOD. went down the hatch pretty well. my friend had a normal gin and tonic.
To eat, we were recommended the crab cakes, lobster burrito, chicken wings, short rib tacos and bbq chicken tacos (new to the menu).
The crab cakes were the best i have ever tasted, Crispy outside, tender inside, and tasted only of crab. 
We settled on two different kinds of tacos (comes 2 on a plate); the short rib and bbq chicken. The short rib taco was a bit dry to my liking but my friend thought it was awesome.... so varying opinions. 
The BBQ chicken was amazing! it was topped with fried brussel sprouts..... really interesting. 
On the side, we ordered a biscuit. it was really good and ginormous. 

Next time, try a bucket. they just empty it out in front of you on the table. Cool concept. 

Total bill: 53$ not bad for the amount of food we had and quality.
Tip: get there early since there is limited seating and don't expect to be there long. Service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I love the patio at Icehouse on a nice night. The beer selection is good. The menu is varied. On my first visit I had the shrimp tacos, served with black beans and saffron rice. On my second visit I split an order of wings - half hot chili garlic and honey bbq. I like smoked wings, and they were a good size, so I was happy. I also got the curry chicken salad in a wrap, which was pretty salty (and I'm a salt lover) so I was a bit disappointed there. The curry flavor was great, as well as the toasted almonds and raisins, it was just oversalted. Living nearby I'm sure we'll be back as the evenings get even more beautiful."}
{"text":"I went to Ice House this evening after reading a great review in Night life Magazine. I thought the atmosphere and the set up was fantastic. Little red tables, tight cozy terrace. The music was great and the place just felt like home cooking. The waitstaff was fair but don't ask the bartender a thing she was a bit rude. The food was good to mediocre I got the fried chicken basket $18 bucks for 4 pieces and two sides, creamy coleslaw and potatoes with a buttery biscuit. I've had better fried chicken in my life the biscuit was great the sides had a bit too much mayo for my preference. They don't skimp in their alcoholic lemonade. 

The only thing that bothered me was getting a pink piece of fried chicken and having the waiter try to convince me to eat the pink chicken. After much discussion about how I didn't want to risk eating pink chicken he eventually brought me another (much smaller) piece. I think when you serve someone even slightly semi cooked chicken your immediate response should be Im so sorry I'll get you some more. 

Go to Ice bar for the atmosphere and drinks but t don't expect an overly amazing meal."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est très petit et il faut attendre un peu pour avoir une place, mais l'attente en vaut vraiment la peine!  La nourriture est très bonne et le service est rapide.  Il y a beaucoup de friture par contre, donc il ne faut pas s'attendre à manger léger, mais les portions sont de bon format!  Et l'entrée de jalapenos farcis au fromage est vraiment délicieuse!!"}
{"text":"I've always had great things to say about this place. The food is fantastic and you really get your bang for your buck. Definitely a Montreal go-to in my books!"}
{"text":"We went here with high expectations. A friend of my son claimed it was one of his favorite restaurants. 

Arrived right before closing and they were kind enough to fry up some chicken for takeout. It was a bit expensive, maybe twice as much as KFC equivalent, but figured it would be worth it. 

Unfortunately it was not. The chicken was kind of dry, the batter was interesting but was missing something. A bit over sweet; not enough pepper or other spice. 

Maybe their ribs are better, but based on the chicken we will not bother going back."}
{"text":"The mahi mahi tacos are the bomb. So is the dirty steak burrito! Thumbs up for friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great beer menu.  Nice outdoor covered patio area with picnic tables.  Cons: But inside lots of TV's and sports bar feel.  And the acoustics suck.  The food was mediocre.  We had BBQ pork sandwich and blackbean & chicken quesadilla. Both were good, just not great"}
{"text":"Raw chicken. I mean bloody, blood flecked inside half the chicken pieces, fried but raw. This was a sick display and offensive, as staff offered us 3 tequila shots or a free desert but charged us (very overpriced to start) for the chicken with no real apology. Eating here is a health risk, staff are arrogant, the menu and design are overpriced mock brooklyn, GIRLS + Ubisoft, with attitude. Massive GMO still bleeding? Come on. Southern food in Montreal? No thanks."}
{"text":"I'm not  a fan of this place, it seems to have a laissez faire vibe and everything is overpriced. I mean sure the food is great (Steak burritos and popcorn shrimp= win!!) but the fact that there are no menus, and you have to awkwardly stand in front of a chalk board figuring out what you want is really annoying.

   Also the service is s**t  20+ minutes for a drink order and the waiter was a bit snappy, but ill give him the BOTD and chalk it up to him having a bad day. I'd go back but it has to be under really special circumstances. Seriously guys like tip 10-15%"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The bilingual staff is good, although the manager is kind of loud and a bit rude. You often get ignored when you are standing at the cash trying to pay. Never make people wait to pay!!
The food is so good though, and there are so many options. Ive been back many times. The prices are fair, but it can add up fast. The drinks are expensive and they charge extra for sauces.
Go for it."}
{"text":"Good food and decent beer prices. It can get a little loud later at night, but does allow for larger groups. Lots of TVs and sports, lots."}
{"text":"Solid choice for dining off the Main, Icehouse offers a full menu of tacos and burritos with interesting combos. ALWAYS order a bourbon lemonade with your meal, not to be missed! 

Good bets:
Popcorn shrimp
Mahi Mahi taco
Pulled pork taco (amazing spicing on this one, a tad heavy on the cloves)"}
{"text":"Franchement,
Mais quelle déception...
Le poulet, est tellement dégueulasse, que je dirai facilement qu'en rapport KFC, cnest excellent.
Les prix sont exorbitant et je m'arrête la car sinon ça serai vraiment trop long..."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to Ice House as a friend was raving about the fried chicken. But was quickly disappointed, not so much by the food, but the poor service that we received. Our waitress was outwardly rude to us throughout the evening - like she decided when we sat down she didn't like us! We asked for help with the menu since it was our first time, and just told us to go look at it. When our food arrived, the coleslaw splattered all over my friend, when it was dropped on the table. Accidents happen, but when our waiter realized it, they weren't any ways apologetic and didn't even offer a wet-napkin for her to clean up the coleslaw that was on her dress and hair. The coleslaw also splattered all over her drink glass, when we asked for a new glass, our waitress looked as us confused, \"you want to wipe it\"? No, we'd like a new glass since this was smothered in coleslaw. We ordered the fried chicken and 7-layer dip and the food itself was good and something I would normally enjoy. But the lack of service and general politeness will not have my return or refer this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Un peu cher, pas le meilleur service en ville, assez gras, mais ô combien attachant. Malgré quelques petits défauts, le Ice House sait charmer par son ambiance texane. L'ambiance est importante pour moi et ce petit restaurant a tout pour me plaire de ce côté là. Pis on va se'l dire, même si la bouffe fait un peu \"Junk\" c'est tout de même excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is quite awesome I love the Philly cheese steak. The place is huge so you never feel overcrowded even when they're busy. I heard they have great lunch specials but can never come during the day but definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"Good food, had the beef wrap and fish tacos( Tacos were actually very good). Ambient is lovely, Service not so much. Found it a little over price but overall it is a great joint. 
I will definitively be back and try other items in the menu.
Bourbon lemonade is quiet good too, pricy at $9 a glass."}
{"text":"11pm Friday no food and wouldn't honor my living social coupon. Told me bar was closing soon too."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other table seated (still early).  The waitress took our drink order and returned quickly.  She could have been friendlier but did her job well.  Service was good. We ordered Teriyaki chicken wings ($5 for 6),  Thai Beef Spring Rolls ($10 for 4) and a Pulled Pork Quesadilla ($9).  The chicken wings were average size, grilled with good flavor but were a bit \"flabby\".  We prefer our chicken wings crispy.  Came with a few celery and carrot sticks and ranch dressing.  Tasty but would not order again.  On to the Thai Beef Spring Rolls........crispy, very tasty but small for the money.....1 inch by 3 inches.  Menu says comes with spicy peanut sauce but we didn't get a peanut sauce, more like a sweet thai chili sauce.  Would order again though.  Finally the quesadilla was REALLY good, just the right amount of cheese, pork and onion served with salsa and sour cream.  Would order again.  
The atmosphere is really beautiful inside with the blue lighting and high ceilings.  I'm sure it must be packed during football season and they have PLENTY of flat screens.  We would definitely return and try other items."}
{"text":"Great Wings/Nachos
Now that we are a good ways into football season, I, like everyone else have two things I want to eat when watching these games. Wings and Nachos. I am giving Ice House a good review and rating on these two dishes for a few different reasons.

I will start off with the wings.  What makes them stand out?  Well, they are not the little baby wings that you find at a lot of other places.  They are always served right off the grill when you get them,( Yes they are grilled) and since they are not deep fried, you can actually taste the flavor of the chicken.(Not just the sauce) Let's face it, when you can get something so common like wings everywhere it takes something special for them to stand out.

As for the Nachos....... I got the pulled pork nachos, which I split with one other person.  The portion is large enough to suffice as a meal for two. Well, for must of us it is. The best thing about the portion size is that you are not having to dig through the chips to find all of the good stuff.  I know when I get nachos most of the time everything is dumped on top of the chips. So once you eat the salsa,peppers, olives, guac, and whatever else is on there, you wind up with about 2/3 of your chips by themselves.  At Ice House this is not the case."}
{"text":"I'm from the South, so I've always been afraid to try any sort of barbecue or Southern-style food in Montreal. When my friend suggested Icehouse for dinner, I decided, why not. I should have gone with my instincts.

We ordered the fried chicken bucket. The fried skin was as hard as a rock and had a strange tang to it. Once I was able to get under the skin, I found that the chicken was undercooked (pink in some places). The biscuits were also undercooked, with a jelly of raw dough in the middle. Disgusting!

Not only that, the waitstaff was incredibly rude. They might want to take a lesson from the people whose food they're (doing a very poor job of) imitating and learn a thing or two about Southern hospitality. When we sat down, our waiter asked us if we were ready to order. When we said we didn't have menus, he got really impatient with us and told us that the menu was on the wall. He then preceded to ignore us for 20 whole minutes. When he finally did take our orders, he got impatient when one of our party was indecisive and left our table. In the end, we got our food 2 hours after we were seated. 

Some places have bad food but nice service. Other places have good food but bad service. This restaurant, having both bad food and bad service, has absolutely no redeeming features. There's a saying, \"Wise men learn from the mistakes of others, and fools learn from mistakes of their own.\" Be that wise person and don't go to Icehouse! Save your Southern food adventures for the real South."}
{"text":"The pitchers of bourbon lemonade are enough to make anyone an instant fan of this place. The chicken and red fish tacos were good. The stuffed jalapenos were excellent (but don't bother if you can't handle some fire). 

Good location for people watching, and the napkin dispensers on the wall are great idea since these can be some pretty messy eats. Perfect for a late evening meal before heading out on the town. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"We met here on a cold snowy Sunday night,

Of all the places to find in mtl, tex-mex is pretty unusual. But I'm so glad it's here. We were 8ppl and we ordered up a storm. Tacos, burritos, 2 buckets of ribs, 7 layer dip, fried apple pie, and to make go down easier a pitcher of iced tea bourbon.

My fave is the pulled pork taco, which is very nice, balanced BBQ flavour  served with fresh lime and some crispy pig skins.

The lobster burrito was ok, it wasn't bad just you couldn't tell it was lobster if no one told you.

The bucket of ribs was amazing, fall off the bones, it was a bit on the sweet side, but nothing bourbon iced tea can't fix. The tangy bourbon iced tea contrasts very well with the BBQ items on the menu.

We completely did not see the hot sauce \"bar\" available at the front counter, next time I come back I'll be sure to borrow...

The fried apple pie with ice cream is just wrong for your figure, but it will bring out the kid in you! And boy is that kid going to be happy :)

Good eating in the neighbourhood :)"}
{"text":"Tiny, casual yet trendy place close to St-Laurent with some great food and drinks at an acceptable price.

They have 6 piknik style tables inside, seating approx. 24, and about 6 seats at the bar along the wall. The outside terrace, that is partially heated, seats about 16-20 people.  
As others mentioned, they don't take reservations so don't go there during prime time without expecting to be seated outside or, worse, wait on the street (no room to wait inside) for a long while.
For some, the food and drinks will be worth the wait & the cold.  

Menu is on a chalk board inside.

The hits: Bourbon lemonade, fried chicken taco, pulled pork taco, lobster burrito, ribs, fried chicken and popcorn shrimps 

The misses: Beef taco, vodka lemonade, crab stuffed jalapenos (they could have been stuffed with squirrel and one couldn't taste the difference the peppers are so overpowering).

Service was fast and friendly.
Not a bad idea to call ahead and see what the wait time is. 514.439.6691"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the entire city. If you ever watch the food network show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it is the kind of place where Guy Fieri would try. The food is amazing, and I have never had a bad experience. 

The bourbon lemonade is sweet and strong. The last time I went I had pink bourbon lemonade which I think is better than the original. Do not drink on an empty stomach or you may end up tipsy before you start eating. The lobster burrito is incredible. It has chunks of lobster in it, black beans, corn and some sauce. It is one of the main reasons to go.  

The fried chicken is also very tender. The presentation is great. The waiter puts a paper over the table, turns the bucket upside down. All the chicken scatters on the paper and enjoy. They also have a variety of hot sauces (if you like things spicy) you can add to any meal. The seven layer dip is beautiful. It has the right amount of creaminess. With perfectly fried tortilla chips.  

Every time I go I get the popcorn shrimp and the lobster burrito and I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicken smashing!!! Okay, I must admit that I arrived at Icehouse with high expectation after seeing it aired on Food Network TV Canada few weeks ago while in Ottawa. I have a couple on my list after my Ottawa stay and is trying to clear as much as I could if they are within reach. 

Since Icehouse is within our radar, we decided then to explore the area where Saint Laurent Boulevard would lead us. The street is long and in between, I spotted some of my \"must-eat\" gems and marked the landmark to make a return. 

Turning right into one of the lane, I enter a quaint street away from the crowd from St Laurent and into rue Roy E. I excitedly trying to eyeball for Icehouse while focusing on my GPS assisted google map working in the background. Smart enough, I knew I have arrived! I rolled my eyes to the left and couldn't hide my excitement when I saw the signage with a calf standing atop the grilling at the entrance. 

The day's business has just began, it's 15mins past 4pm. We were their 1st couple on Thursday! We chose our 2-seater and the lady came to us with a glass of tap and asked if we wanna start off with some drinks. Bourbon lemonade's  a winner, leave the ice tea out! The latter is so tad sourish and lifeless for a $4 while I enjoyed the former much even though it cost slightly higher at $9. The lady politely introduced the special for the day and told us the menu is on the chalkboard right above the bar counter. Right away, I admitted that I came here for their fried chicken and she was happy to list me all the sides that came with it. Well, I guess she's thrilled about the media publicity seems to work. We were the only Asian gals in the petite dining room. Crowd floods the room soon. 

Within 15minutes, she returned with a brown parchment paper ripped off from its roll and laid it on our table, along with 2 forks and towelettes. Along with, she brought along 2 condiments that she sing praises: less spicy nectarous mustard sauce and another more fiery one. I opt for the former while my sister went for the latter. I agreed with the lady that the condiments did a good job on the fried chicken for a more flavorful experience.

Seriously, I do not know what makes a good tex-mex fried chicken but if it was going to be something I had at Icehouse, then I will be disappointed. The chicken parts  were decent in size, not too small. But the problem we had lies in its rock-liked crust. I am not sure if that was how it meant to be when u claimed that its a Tex classic? The meat was bland, bare and unseasoned. If that's the reason for the hot/sweet mustard condiments to work magic on, then there's no way I would agree more. If the DP sauce has been a bit generous, then the deeply fried bird could be coated well in the vinegary element to reverse its disastrous fate. The texture in the parts were tough but slightly better in the drumstick and wing parts that form 2/5 of the half basket. It will be questionable to spend $18/5 fried chicken only to get a dry texture wrapped around a thick layer of battered stone crust, extremely charred. 

But I did appreciate the buttermilk biscuits which are intensely buttered in taste, moist and soft, very moreish! The biscuit was baked thick and good for 2. Then comes the 2 salads that I loved the creaminess with a hint of tanginess in the soft boiled new potatoes. The slaw did a good job too. Slight tart and very refreshing, a good companion to ward off any greasiness. 

I enjoyed the causal dining atmosphere but less on the famed fried chicken. I guess they have other well deserving dishes which I didn't mange to try, perhaps the burrito is one? Not sure."}
{"text":"I've been to Icehouse several times and always came out satisfied, until this last time.  Perhaps it's because it was a Sunday, when typically restaurant chefs take the day off, but the chicken was dry and bland and simply not worth the expense.  I'll come back to try one more time, with hopes it's good, but it seems this spot is a hit or miss, nothing consistent."}
{"text":"Went to see the afternoon game today, not a place I would recommend; amateur bartender and some drunken redneck tried to pick a fight over bar seats, they need to hire a profesisional staff that can serve better"}
{"text":"Bangin hot whiskey cider.

Food truck events in the parking lot.

Cool bartenders.

Lots of TV's."}
{"text":"I heard all sorts of good reviews for this place.  I went last night and had the worst experience I have had in restaurant.  Deep fried chicken had a 1 inch crust and inside chicken was raw.  We had an assortment of tacos all very blan and boring didn't eat half of them.  The 7 layer dip was severed in a small round plastic container and was Impossible to eat and all I could taste was olives.  The French fries where horrible.  I was with a friend who eats out and we both couldn't believe how bad the food was.  The service was horrible? Tons of attitude.   The menu on the wall was noy visible from half the restaurant.  I asked for a menu and the girl looked at me and told me it was on the wall and to stand up.   I get that they are trying to give a certain feel to this place, but if you can't get the food to make up for it then it fails.   I've been told the cooks have changed in the last few months so I'm going to blame it on  that.   I do not recommend even trying this place.   Horrible.   There are many new BBQ place in the city that are cheaper and better"}
{"text":"I mostly enjoy this place because it's a fun spot to go with friends. One of my favorite things to do for an early dinner with a few pals (early because Icehouse fills up so quickly), is to order a pitcher of bourbon lemonade, a bucket of chicken, and a bucket of ribs. It's a pretty amazing feeling when you're super hungry and someone comes over and just dumps a mountain of fried chicken and biscuits on the table right in front of you. It's a super-casual good time and feels just like you're at a backyard BBQ that you never ever have to clean up. 

Honestly, though, I go to Icehouse more for the feast-fest than because I love their fried chicken and/or ribs. I think they add honey to their fry batter or something -- not sure. Normally, I can really get behind a killer savory-sweetish combo, but when it comes to fried chicken, I'm a traditionalist. Don't get me wrong, though -- it's still good (maybe even great). But just not my fav. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone, which is exactly how I think a rib should be, and they sure are tasty. But again, just not my fav."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT time sunday watching the game!  great atmosphere great service!!!  Ask for Tiffany if you go she was terrific!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rick the manager was very accommodating for us. Put on the Chicago Blackhawks game we wanted to see. We asked for closed captioning but he outdid that by putting on the sound! Our waitress, was very attentive plus actually showed interest in what we were cheering for. The range of draft beers available was broad. The banana bread pudding was especially delicious. Would highly recommend this sports bar!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of spot you think is awesome when you've never visited the American Southwest. My expectations were somewhat met. Some menu items are solid and totally worth it, some are three times the price they should be. That bourbon lemonade pitcher, as delicious as it is, is a total rip-off at over 40$ plus tax. What do you guys put in there ? Liquid gold ? Stick to the beer and you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"1/2 price bottle of wine put me in a great mood to flirt w the hot bartender:) excellent place to watch football"}
{"text":"If you want greasy comfort food.... This is the place to go. I can't bring myself to order anything other than the lobster burrito as a main (though have sampled other people's fare) and have always found it to be perfect. The appetizers are alway perfect for sharing (popcorn shrimp, jalapeño poppers and oysters have always been crowd pleaders). The only thing I am not a fan of is the potato salad.... though this has more to do with personal preference than the quality of the product. The service is friendly and the locale charming. Wash it all down with a bourbon lemonade and you'll be set.... Get there early or you'll be waiting awhile."}
{"text":"My favorite place to watch the games. The wings and Tuna appetizer are awesome!"}

I was a little disappointed with the ribs. The flavour wasn't there and the sauce was very mild. The server was very nice though and explained everything on the menu to us because we don't understand French. 

Putting the food on parchment paper is brilliant; it adds to the dining experience."}
{"text":"The family and I had traveled to Charlotte to check out the Ikea (which was an adventure in itself), and following our visit we searched for a pet friendly restaurant to have a dinner.  One of the recommendations that had good reviews was the Icehouse South End.  

We arrived to find a semi-busy location with an outdoor patio where you could keep pets and enjoy a meal or drink.  While the main idea of that statement was true... If you plan to dine on the patio, you need to be a smoker.  If you are not, then don't plan to visit unless there is a steady breeze.  Our family (including our two small dogs), spent the evening in a constant drift of second hand smoke.

If that had been the only issue,  I probably would have taken the 'live and learn' mentality and not written this review... but the situation got worse.

After waiting about 10 minutes to even be greeted,  we were told that it was a good thing we hadn't been taken care of yet because she ( our waitress Kandice) 'was the best'.   We were actually excited to have someone with such a positive attitude.  That attitude was short lived.  While we did get our drinks,  the first attempt wasn't correct.  Again,  maybe just a fluke situation.  

We continued to review our menus to decide what to eat.  The selection is diverse and should offer most at least one or two dishes they would enjoy.  We placed our order (probably 15 minutes after being asked the first time).  

Food came within another 15 minutes.  Food was 'good' but nothing Special.

Kandice managed to check with us just after the other staff had delivered our meals to the table and finally fixed the first drink issues and refilled the others that had been depleted.  We didn't have her stop by again until at least 15 minutes after we had finished eating.  In fact my wife and youngest daughter had left the table to keep themselves and our dogs from suffering the smokers overflow any longer.  

After finally dropping off our bill to the tables, again our waitress disappeared  for at least another 10 minutes, and only then to return to serve other customers at the outside bar.    I finally walked my bill up to the bar in person to finish the transaction.  

While I can't state it as confirmed fact, it seemed she only had four tables and then two or three customers at the bar she was tag-teaming service with another staff member. She didn't have a load that most wait staff couldn't easily balance with better intervals of check-in / refresh.

So other pet enthusiasts be aware,  while this establishment does permit the attendance of your pets on the patio; before you decide to try it out,  understand the potential situation you may encounter.  

Here's to hoping our visit was the exception and not the rule."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, friendly staff, ok food nothing to rave about"}
{"text":"The food is not that great. The menu is not that great. The atmosphere is not that great. The service is slow when it is busy. The waitresses could be hotter."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up, I would have given it 5 stars.  The food was incredible!!!  My wife used to send me over there just to get a side salad because it was so good.  I have called the buffalo chicken wrap from Icehouse as the best I've ever had.

No longer.  The food went from excellent to poor.  Everything was bland and tired tasting.  The ranch dressing was watery and tasted almost fishy.  The buffalo chicken wrap was dry and fell apart when I tried to eat it.  No blue cheese; now they give you that watery ranch on the side.  The side salad went from quality greens to iceberg.  The wings were overcooked.  The BBQ was horrible.  There wasn't one thing on the table that people actually enjoyed.  What a disappointment.

Service was slow.  The waitress was nice.

I brought my family here from out-of-town thinking they'd be impressed and I was just embarrassed.  They should be too.

2 stars for atmosphere and the beer selection.  It was crowded during the Panthers game and they had plenty of TVs.  But....man cannot live on beer and football alone.  Well, not for long, anyway."}
{"text":"Great food! Menu has a lot of options! Tons of BEEER!!! Great sports bar, clean, staff is friendly, tons of TV's. Love this place!!!! Recommend the chicken nachos...they are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Gave it another shot and was grossed out again

Tacos were fine.

Chicken was gross- really dry, over cooked, had some pieces that were not well butchered and were basically battered bone. The seasoning was off. Biscuits were great. Potato salad wasn't for me, and coleslaw was also mediocre. Would only go back for drinks and  maybe some light snacks, will not go back for a meal.  

Service is good, like the iced tea, good ambiance but there is a TV or two-  not for everyone"}
{"text":"Ok. I really want to give this place a better review. I can't though. They won't let me. Every time I go, the food is pretty good (especially the lobster burrito), but there is always some lame ass moment. If you go alone they will most certainly make you wait while they let couples pass you by. EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING 45 MINUTES PLUS. Yeah, first world problems, I know. Still sucks when you are paying $20 for a lobster burrito and over $7 for beer and tipping 20%. The burrito is good, but truly not worth the hassle. Their booze drinks are WEAK. I have sat at the 'bar' area and watched them put about half a shot of bourbon in the overpriced bourbon lemonade. The staff seem fairly nice but always in a rush. Ultimately this place is Canadian kids playing dress up at tex-mex BBQ. And way overcharging you for it. Last time I went I gave up and left. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ce qui m'y a amené? Je travaillais près de ce restaurant et leurs cuisines sont ouvertes très tard certains soirs de la semaine. 

Le concept est intéressant. C'est un tout petit restaurant avec de la nourriture individuelle ou à partager servie dans des sacs, des cartons ou du papier. Bref, à la bonne franquette. Ce que ça me rappelle? Un fast food, mais version haut de gamme et en beaucoup plus gras!

Ce que j'ai le plus aimé? Leurs cocktails: l'endroit offre des limonades ou des thés glacés agrémentés de bourbon. C'est simple et délicieux."}
{"text":"Overpriced Mediocre Food. Pretentious Service.

I only eat here because I live around the corner.

None of the items on the menu are particularly memorable or remarkable. In fact, just about everything tastes like what you'd expect from a hipster who developed an interest in Americana cuisine and has watched too many YouTube cooking videos.

The drinks, however, redeem a visit. They have a solid selection of local beer, and their bourbon lemonade and ice tea are better enjoyed by the pitcher than by the glass.

When it comes to the service, though, it ranges from rude to condescending, and is always slow (which is odd given how small the place is). The staff just generally tends to treat you as though they're doing you a favor for letting you eat there.

If you're in the neighborhood and you're looking for a quick drink and snack before you move on to something better, it might be worth visit. If you're looking to enjoy an actual meal, though, I'd urge you to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Icehouse we noticed our server sitting at a nearby table throughout most of our meal. Another server frequently came by our table to refill our water or to apologize for slow service. At one point I happened to look down and noticed bright green gum stuck to the back of both my legs and all over my knee high boots. Someone had stuck their chewed gum to the front of the seat. Upon letting the other server know so we could possibly get a towel or napkin I noticed our server still sitting at the other table. Finally she came by and when we once again mentioned the gum assuming someone would offer a towel or an apology she replied \"We all have personal problems.\" Um, what?!? 

It wasn't her or the restaurant's fault obviously and I wasn't looking for a free meal or even an offer to cover the cleaning costs, but an apology or visit by the manager would have gone a long way. Just stop by the table with a wet towel, apology and offer to help and it would have been fixed. The gum came off and aside from some inconvenience and embarrassment at walking around with the backs of my legs covered in gum there is no lasting effect -- aside from the determination NEVER to go back to Icehouse. 

That server was obnoxious and the management lacking."}
{"text":"If you like bad food and mediocre service this place is a must!!!  Ordered the blackened shrimp pasta Alfredo... Ask upon being served if the shrimp were blackened and was told by two different servers that that is the way they do it here.  Took some pictures for your entertainment."}
{"text":"Yes they do have a good beer selection. Their food is decent. Fried pickles portion was pathetic though. Their pimento burger was pretty good but WAY over cooked. I may be bashing the food but it wasn't that bad. Service on the other hand... Order a beer only to have the server come back and tell me they were out of my selection. Rather than getting my new order she left and I didn't see her for 15 min. Friend of mine came a little later, ordered a beer, 20 min later it finally arrived. The servers response for the wait? \"sorry I had to brew it myself...\" nope not a substitute for bad service. Better luck next time Icehouse"}
{"text":"HELLO BEER! This place was formerly known as the Southend Brewery and it hasn't really changed all that much. It has a HUGE selection of beer, so if you're a beer fan you'll want to step foot in this venue before any other. The people are great, super nice! It has a really cool modern feel to it. The food is pretty decent (they even made me a POUTINE, which is a Canadian delicacy... look it up... you won't be sorry) and overall I left very pleased. I'd definitely go back! Bring a sweater, they keep their AC on pretty high :)"}
{"text":"The name is misleading. I was expecting a house made out of ice. Upon arriving I was disappointed to see just a regular bar.  I thought I had the wrong address put in but when i asked around for an icehouse they said that was it. Food is good so it gets 3 stars"}
{"text":"Not a bad place but can be slow service when packed. Food when we were there wasn't all that but we were told that they were in the middle of changing their menu so we will have to get back to check it out."}
{"text":"This place is crap. Bartender completely unavail and then when she does pay attention completely raucous and obnoxious. Where am I? I've been here 3 times - gave it the benefit of the doubt and everytime bad service by all.."}
{"text":"We live really close to Icehouse and want to like it but I won't be returning after giving it multiple tries.  I think the lack of service and lack of caring about customers must start with the ownership and trickle down through the staff.  First visit I came in to watch a football game.  They have countless TVs and I asked if I could watch the Bears game on any of them.  Was promptly told by the hostess no, they are a panthers bar.  As frustrated as I was, I understood and came in anyway as all the other bars in the area were full.  Only to discover there were other games on, and the Bears game was playing.  Sat at a table outside where we struggled to get any service until we finally went inside and were helped by a very nice bartender. 

Take me to St. Patrick's Day of 2015.  Should have known when they were the only bar in the area that was almost empty.  Every bar had a St. Patrick's theme with a lot of activity, Icehouse had a car bomb special as their attempt to celebrate.  Which is OK, just wanted a beer and food.  However, I guess that was too much to ask for.  Came in and a waitress acknowledged me as I sat down and said she would be right with me.  After her passing us by for 10 minutes, looking at me and never acknowledging me, I asked her if we could get some menus.  She said yes, and walked away, obviously something was more important.  We got up and got our own menus.  When she came back, she apologized and said it wasn't her table.  However, no other wait staff came to help through the evening.  We finally ordered our drinks and dinner.  20-30 minutes after we ordered, we were told they were out of chicken parmesan.  As we were expecting our food, they were telling us it wasn't available.  No problem, we ordered something different and I ordered another beer.  10-15 minutes later she told me they were really struggling with the beer tap and asked if I wanted a different kind.  10 minutes later i received the different beer.  

Received the food, at least some of it.  The stuff they had to make because they didn't have the primary dish was warm, the rest was cold.  Cold enough that a 7 year old said it was cold, so we're not talking luke warm.  That being said, one dish was missing.  When we asked the person bringing it out, she lied and said it was in the kitchen, she just had to pick it up.  5 minutes later, the waitress came back and said it was just being pulled out of the oven.  Of course it was, they just tried to make it really quick.  It came out undercooked with the cheese not melted.  When we got the bill, the original dish was on there and we had to ask for another one with the new food on it.

This was not just our experience, but the experience of those around us as I heard at least one other table ask for the manager's number.  They were told there was no manager on duty and that the same waitress described above was the highest person in charge there.  She did give them the card of the manager though.  And on a side note, had the tuna wrap that tasted absolutely horrible.  I took a couple of bites and left the rest.  Whoever came up with the recipe never actually tasted this beast.

So with all said, a horrible tasting dish was the least of our issues.  As I started with, the fact nobody seems to care about customers or customer service starts with the ownership.  Great location, get a new owner who knows how to run a place and they can make a bundle in this location."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY order the BOURBON LEMONADE!

With that cleared up, this is a hip, unpretentious little restaurant that serves really creative comfort food. 

The 5 of us arrived at about 10pm on a warm Saturday night (kitchen is open till 2:30am) and found the place relatively empty so we were able to snag a table on the wooden terrace. 

The tables are basically pic nic tables, there are no menus (there's a very visible blackboard), very little in the way of plates or cutlery (bring baby wipes!)....and lots and lots of fried food perfect for sharing!

We shared the bucket of fried chicken with biscuits, cole slaw and potato salad - which was literally served on parchment paper directly on the table. The chicken was crispy and delicious. 

We also shared the jerk shrimp tacos, crispy beef tacos and the lobster burrito (tacos come in 2s and burrito is cut in half). The shrimp tacos were very good, the beef were good but not particularly exceptional and the lobster burrito was pretty good."}
{"text":"The style:
- this is a meat house, the focus is in tex-mex (ribs, chicken, burritos, etc)
- there arent alot of veggies or sides, they believe the burrito order doesnt need anything else. Buckets of ribs and chicken some with potato and coleslaw
- they are friendly but their style is aggressive. They will throw things onto the table (coleslaw, ribs)
- there are no plates, just a roll of brown paper on the table
- there are no knives and forks unless you ask for them

The good:
- the ribs where very good
- lobster burrito was also very good
- positions where fair size, burrito was enough for an adult

The bad: 
- its very expensive, burrito was $20
- they make you wait outside
- the dont take reservations
- if you are only 2 they will mostlikely ask you to sit with someone else unless a table of two is available... Ideally come with a group and helpfully your timing is good enough that you can find a spot that fits your party

Overall very enjoyable, great experience, highly recommend.... Just know its not a date restaurant, it a guy night out restaurant"}
{"text":"Idk why this place has 3.5 stars???!! Everything about this place was so cool. The staff was great. The owner is great and super involved. The bourbon lemonade is absolutely delicious! Like sooooo amazing! The honey drizzle on the fried chicken was perfect. The potato salad  left me wanting more and more. It's a super chill atmosphere. I'm so glad I didn't let the 3.5 drive me away from coming here. It's so worth it!!! Go! Oh and the biscuit!! Yuuum yum yum."}
{"text":"Decent but boring spot in Charlotte. Food is pretty good and the beer selection is great , but this place just really lacks personality. If someone comes in town and asks me where to go, I can't imagine saying \"Icehouse, it's something you HAVE to see.\" They are doing everything logistically right, it's just a snooze fest whenever I go."}
{"text":"Icehouse is a controversially good place. I've been postponing a visit there for a long time for one very annoying reason - they don't take reservations. And I don't go to places where I don't have a guaranteed table. Me and long lines are clearly not friends. 

Anyways, Icehouse is an interesting take on a New American cuisine taqueria style:

Location: located one block from the St Laurent madness, it's very convenient to stop by for those awesome tacos

Reception: this place doesn't take reservations, and is a little too proud/arrogant about it. I understand that one of them has studied economics 101 and figured out that low supply (or impression of it) will result in higher demand. Food is not economics. You have influencers, who get pissed off at waiting and no reservations, and you have everyone else who will follow influencers. I personally know at least 20 foodies, who refuse to go to Icehouse just because they don't like the uncertainty and possibility of waiting. 

Ambiance: it's a garage converted into a restaurant. Super simple design, good, crowded, loud ambiance. Slightly pretentious in its simplicity, but still interesting. 

Food: food is great. I had all kinds of tacos, burrito, sides - it is all good. Sometimes a bit too much sauce or parsley, but guess what - tastes differ. 

Drinks: they don't have coffee, tea, or anything non-alcoholic except water and lemonade. So if you don't drink, you are shit out of luck. And no espresso after your dinner. Suck it up and go to second cup around the corner. And then re-read my point about pretentiousness/arrogance above. 

Conclusion: I will only go back there on weekdays around 6-7pm, since this is when they will likely have free tables. If they don't (and they don't take reservations), I will totally log back on here and change this review to a much worse one. 

Note to owners: People, there is opentable, telephone, text messages, internet, mail pigeons for gods sake to take reservations. If you don't make enough money to install phone/computer to take reservations, I'm sure there will be plenty of Montreal yelpers who will donate enough money to buy you a netbook! I will be the first one!"}
{"text":"If you feel like eating fat and getting dirty, I highly recommend Icehouse. Fried chickens are on tables and it comes with coleslaw and potatoes salads. Chickens comes it realy big pieces and they are very crispy. It also comes with a piece of bread in the bucket and it is buttery and a bit sweet. We also ordered mahi mahi tacos and pulled pork tacos. If you are a sensitive to spicy food, beware of the mahi mahi tacos. One of the garnish is hot pepper and it can get pretty strong."}
{"text":"Oh no... I ate too much, but it was all delicious including the cole slaw and the potato salad. Everything was great. What a great taco, what great ribs, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place. The bartender was attentive,  waitress (Marg) was fantastic, and our order of chicken tenders was the best ever; the tuna achi was magnificent.  We'll definitely be back on our next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was average. The real reason I am writing this review is because of the management. After eating there last night I looked over my bank statement and noticed an additional charge aside from what I paid for my meals and my drinks, and not it wasn't the tip. It was almost $50 that had been charged to my debit card of food and drink I did not order. Well obviously I was surprised and somewhat irritated, so I gave them a call. I asked to speak to a manager and held for no longer than three minutes while someone went to get him. Sean, the manager on duty, was extremely polite and efficient. He asked about the problem and immediately took action. He put the money back on my card and all was taken care of within minutes. He even told me to ask for him the next time I was in and he would give me an appetizer on the house. I was pleasantly surprised at how easily and quickly he resolved the issue and was impressed with his customer service. Kudos to Sean at Icehouse in the South End."}
{"text":"One of the best 'veggie' burritos I've ever had. The bourbon lemonade was really good, too."}
{"text":"Small yet cozy animated restaurant!  I was anticipating  great food the moment I walked in. 

There homemade limonade and bourbon is delicious and refreshing.  I also had the chance to try their mahi mahi tacos. The fried fish was warm and crispy , and the tangy coleslaw reallly brought everything together. I have to  go   back and definitely try more oof their   menu!

Positive points : good service , great deco and cheap eats

Debbie downer point:   might not  be your style if you are looking for an intimate spot as everyone is squish together.  Expect  to share a  picnic table with strangers if you are only two.....(I personally did not mind at all )"}
{"text":"Patio and terrasse are so perfect. A lot of people, reservation is impossible.
Happy Hours worth it all the way.

Food is good. Different kind of tacos: Chicken, fish and shrimp are the best.
Drinks are Home made and pretty interesting : Pimped iced the is great.

Looking forward to go back to this place this summer after work!
Cheers"}

{"text":"I stopped in here to catch the pre season football game. I requested to sit outside the weather was perfect.  My waitress was ok. I ordered my food and drink.  Midway through eating I noticed an army of ants coming up the wall where I was seated. I was mortified.  Then I looked over & a dog jumps up to bite a lady coming from the rest room. Horrible!!! The manager came over and apologized,  took half off the bill. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Looks like it's closed,  I can understand why.  This place is awful."}
{"text":"Icehouse 

Short and Sweet 

The line up was a bit long, the place was tiny . I didn't like that menu was written up on a chalk board wall . I couldn't read half of the items ( not many ) and had to basically go near and around other patrons to read the menu. They should provide a paper menu at least. The service was fast and efficient no fuss. 

What we ordered :
fried chicken taco,
old school beef taco
popcorn shrimps
bbq chicken burrito

We also ordered a big jug of bourbon lemonade 

The tacos were yummy , the right balance of ingredients and spices. The only thing i would change would be the soft taco shell on the fried chicken taco.

I wasn't a fan of the popcorn shrimps WAY too sweet and they were tine shrimps. As for the BBQ chicken burrito whoever came up should *^*&%$%^#$#! Im sure there somebody out there who loves it, but as for me NOPE! I dont know if it was the bbq sauce who messed up the whole burrito. 

I believe our total was about 70$ or maybe more. 

Icehouse is worth the try.  But don't expect too much!"}
{"text":"Like others, I checked out this place only b/c I had a Groupon. I was sure I was going to have a bad experience because it seems like a cursed locations where restaurants (no matter how good they are) but I had the Groupon so I grabbed and a friend and off we went. We went on a Thursday night where they have a $2 Carolina Blonde and Carolina Strawberry special (they have $4 Margaritas on Tuesdays) I got one just to try the Strawberry but knew that by drinking these, would not help much towards the $30 mark since my friend wasn't hungry. 

We had attentive service, ordered the chips and queso for a starter and it was great. The salsa was better than some I've had at authentic Mexican places and honestly, I wanted to put my straw in the queso dip and have at it.....but supposedly ladies nor humans are supposed to behave like that. 

I got the Large Pulled Pork Platter with fries and slaw and again, didn't disappoint. The pork had a western carolina based sauce and the cole slaw was different with a vinegar dressing which I loved. After a few bites of each I was full so I got it to go and it was even better as leftovers. 

I am really hoping they stay in business because I was all around happy with my experience. Large place with a spacious patio, tv's as far as the eye can see and a humongous beer list. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This has been my 4th time eating here and it never disappoints. Service is phenomenal and there service is always fantastic. This place is worth the line up. I suggest going early weekdays. Fish tacos are a must have"}
{"text":"Went to Icehouse for lunch with my beer-loving family when they were in town - Great choice.  I had the pulled-pork sloppy joe, which is basically just pulled pork that's been simmering in sauce, with a slice of cheese on top.  Good sauce, and nice bark on the pulled pork.  Family members ordered the blackened fish po boy and the buffalo chicken wrap.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and the buffalo chicken sandwich somehow stayed crispy for hours when I took home the leftovers.

As for the beer, it's a great selection (mainly bottles, tap list was disappointingly small at 8 beers vs something like 200 bottles).  Despite the few draft beers, the bottle selection gives beer lovers a good opportunity to try tons of random beers, and still never make it through the list."}
{"text":"In the past I have enjoyed icehouse but those days are done. My co-workers and I went to enjoy lunch today but quickly lost appetite. 

I was unsure and kept going between the margarita pizza and burger. The waitress ( with a trainee with her) said she would give us another minute to decide. Unknowingly I decide to try the burger instead of the previously ordered pizza. I ordered the burger with mayo, cheese, lettuce and grilled onions. The waitress proceeded to ask \" so you don't want a burger on the menu?\" (Attitude) and I said \"no\" and repeated what I wanted - not that hard! As I was in mid-sentence, not knowing there was an issue, the blonde waitress walked away and I was unable to complete my order and left the trainee standing there dumbfounded.

As we waited for our food ( who knows what I was even getting) the blonde waitress ( wish I would have gotten her name) proceeded to have the trainee tell us she would not be coming back to our table and the trainee would not be able to as well. 

To sum it up...
We requested for the manager to come over and informed him of our issues with the service. He apologized, comped our meal and ensured he would address her as she abandoned us as customers. 

The food was ok as I lost my appetite, the trainee ( wish I knew her name) was excellent ( we left her a hefty tip) but the main waitress needs a new job.

Would only go back for maybe a drink - only if the blonde waitress with glasses is not there! Sad :( Really liked the place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I think it is a neat place.  I like the fact that they have hightop and lowtop tables.  Sometimes though, it is hard to see many tv's with where you are sitting (we went during NCAA tournament time for our first time), so that's not always the greatest for trying to watch several games at once.

As far as the food goes.  The first time I went there I had a chicken wrap, and it was pretty good.  Last week on my return, my boyfriend and I split wings, bbq quesadillas, and fried pickles.  The wings were pretty good, a very smokey taste, which I liked.  The bbq quesadillas were excellent!!!  I highly recommend those.  The fried pickles were just blah, I didn't care for the taste of the batter but they were still okay.

Good place and I will return, just not my favorite sports place."}
{"text":"If you know me you know I love tacos and this place is doing tacos right. The chicken tacos at ice house are out of this world. There's only a couple ingredients but they com together well. Fried chicken jalapeño lettuce and a delicious sauce make them killer. I'm not a big fish person but the fish tacos here are worth trying. And if for some reason tacos aren't your thing they have buckets of friend chicken fried oyster po boys and just so much more to try it definitely come check out ice house"}
{"text":"there aren't too many tex-mex places in montreal to compare to. however, in general the food is pretty good. not exceptional. some menu items seem over prepared for tex-mex food. it can get cramped on fridays and saturdays."}
{"text":"This is a decidedly Montreal take on a classic Texas staple: the ice house. The concept of the ice house is this: it's damn hot outside, so let's sit in the shade, order a bucket of cheap beer, and let our dogs run around. So what then is an establishment like this doing in Montreal? I don't know the answer to that, but the similarities to Texas ice houses stop at the decor, meaning the decor is Texas themed. 

They have Shiner Bock posters up, but do not serve Shiner, what gives? Next departure would be prices. Ice houses are supposed to serve a bucket of cheap, light beer cans (Lone Star, Shiner, Coors, Bud, ect. choose your piss-water). Instead beer here is still piss-water, but damn expensive piss-water, even by the pitcher. 

Never far from an ice house is a $1 taco truck serving up delicious street tacos. Montreal's Ice House serves delicious food, but it's $$$. Have you ever paid $16 for a burrido? Now you can. The food is tasty, but everything here is very expensive in defiance of the core Ice House principals of providing a cheap place to hang out."}
{"text":"Out. Standing. The two gents working the place on a Tuesday night were impressive in customer service, deliciousness, and quickness. Get the tacos, get the Molson, get happy."}
{"text":"IceHouse can be a hit or miss.  I've been several times, and some nights it is PACKED, and others, you could hear a pin drop.  It has been a strange dynamic.  As others have commented, the food is mediocre.  The beer selection is good, service is ok.  The TVs are great.  It is a great place to watch football, but not a great place to go and eat.  Many of the tables are high tops, which aren't kid friendly.  Unless they have music playing or there is a football game on, there are probably better places to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Les crevettes popcorn sont magiques, mais l'attitude des serveurs est pénible. Dans leurs têtes, ils sont way cooler than you."}
{"text":"Great patio. Perfect place to watch sports games. Food is good and variety on the menu. During football playoffs they put signs on the tvs of which games will be playing so you can sit accordingly. Busy place and staff does well handling the volume."}
{"text":"I can't really say much since I haven't eaten here yet but the space inside is wide open and very inviting. The drinks are priced a little on the premium end but probably worth it if you are looking more for atmosphere than specials. Also, the bar outside is a great place to sit and enjoy the cool weather while you down a couple pints."}
{"text":"Pros = beer selection and tons of TV's 
Cons = food 

Would go here to watch a game at the bar and drink some beers. Would not go here for the food. Maybe the burgers or sandwiches are good, but I didn't try them as I had the fish tacos. Bland flavors and small portions for the price, which was high for what you get. No sides (rice/beans) for the tacos either. I would recommend side for the fish tacos. Willing to try again, but I'll go with a typical bar sandwich next time..."}
{"text":"Not sure why someone said the service was poor - I found it very friendly and considerate.

The ribs: they aren't my kind of ribs but they are very good. If you like them falling off the bone and quite sweet, they are for you. I happen to prefer mine on the vinegary side of the spectrum and a bit tougher.

The lobster burrito is awesome, if pricy (but you're getting half a lobster!). 

Only thing missing is a beach.

(Ever noticed that for every restaurant that serves burritos in every city in North America,  there's always at least one Yelp review from someone from California dismissing the burrito as not as good as the ones in California?)"}
{"text":"Icehouse is great! Southend has needed a big place like this and now we have it. I see others don't like the food but I have been three times and have never had a bad meal--I've taken groups of 4 or 5 each time and no one complained. In fact, we all tried each others' food and loved it. 

The extensive beer selection only serves to make the dining experience more enjoyable as you can try anything and everything. 

Rest assured that this is a casual dining experience where you can relax, have fun, and enjoy a good night out watching a game with friends."}
{"text":"I like my restaurants small and recluse. With good music playing (The Pixies, duh), autographed photographs of retired skaters hanging on the wall (Tony Alva) and a small but perfect menu: tacos, tacos, and tacos. 

I'd eat here every night if my waist band and wallet allowed me. I love their popcorn shrimp, portobello tacos, their veggie burrito (guac for miles) and their crab nachos. This place has something for everyone. Also, their bourbon lemonade is the perfect libation / thirst quencher. They also sell pitchers of beer.

Don't be surprised if you bump into Win Butler."}
{"text":"The one thing that truly stood out besides the laid-back vibe of the restaurant is their bourbon lemonade. One is just not enough. And you can get them in pitchers. Need I say more?

I'm a fan of their informal friendly style. The only menu is on a chalkboard at the front of the restaurant but the menu options are mouth watering. 

We had the fish tacos and popcorn shrimp. I've had better tacos in Montreal but the popcorn shrimp was delicious. 

Try this place for a laid back bite to eat - just don't pass up the lemonade."}
{"text":"Fried Oyster Po-Boy! This little place serves ups some serious southern inspired food. Get their early since they don't take reservations. The patio out front is a great place to people watch."}
{"text":"Icehouse is a solid lunch spot with lots of choices! I had the steak and blue cheese salad.. and I was disappointed that the steak was really chewy and yucky. The rest of the salad was great, but I would've preferred to pay an extra couple of bucks for some decent steak. Luckily the menu is HUGE with so many other great options. My friend had a burger which was great and my other friend had a delicious fish sandwich. There are alot of TVs if you want to watch sports. I will be back and try something new :)"}
{"text":"2nd Review: I've been to Icehouse on 5 different occasions so obviously, I've been a fan. But not anymore. I was quite disappointed in the way they handle their clients if they happen to be a pair. Here's what happened: 

On our arrival we were asked if we would like to sit outside but declined because it was windy and cold. Despite there being 2 free seats at the bar we were told to wait - I did mention them to the waitress but she didn't acknowledge me. I just figured they don't use those seats for customers. After 10 mins of waiting in the cold a table was freed up and we were asked if we would like these seats but that we could only have them if we're willing to share with 2 other people. We said sorry, no thanks.  

So a pair of ladies came in and was promptly seated at the 4pax table because they were okay sharing tables. Another 15 mins go by and two guys show up and the waitress asks them if they would like to sit at the two seats at the bar that were  free (but we thought it wasn't available because she ignored me when I asked about it), to which they reply: 

\"But these 2 were here before us\"

and she says

\"Ce n'est pas grave\" (Oh don't worry about it)

And in they go to sit to eat. Why didn't see give those seats to us before and why is she letting them in before us?!

Needless to say we were getting annoyed as it was the 3rd pair of people who were seated before us. We felt like we were being punished for not wanting to have our dinner right next to two strangers.

Shortly after a table for 4 becomes free and after 5-10 mins of waiting (expecting they would give it to us..) I ask the other waiter what's the deal. I tell him we've been waiting 30+ mins in the cold and that there's a free table inside that we could use. He says \"We only have two 2pax tables and this is our policy.\" I tell him it's a ridiculous policy and he shrugs it off and leaves.

What a terrible way to treat your customers, especially when there's no one waiting behind us in line. It's not like we were even holding bigger groups back or anything. We just stood there incredulous and decided to leave. Lesser patient people would have made a much bigger fuss much earlier. Instead I felt this review would be enough to let others know that if you're a couple and don't wish to sit right against 2 strangers, you better hope those 2 places inside are free and that the waitress doesn't pick favorites."}
{"text":"It's bad I can't leave zero star, in few words since I'm still sitting here, overpriced and bad food, no mention the chicken was most disgusting think I tried in my life, never again! Believe the good fakes review and be so disappointed like me right now..."}
{"text":"The Spot: 
Hot, smokey and vibrant would be my description of the plateau's staple tex-mex restaurant, Ice House. Where once stood a mexican style restaurant with a great tequila menu but hardly the clientele to support it, Ice House now has taken over, boasting a constantly packed house of patrons eager to fill their belly's with authentic Texas style eats.

What's Really Good: 
We've got two words for you: Lobster burrito. Yup I said it. The Fried Chicken is good too. Ice House has what I call a \"lo-fi restaurant style\". With its simple brown paper tablecloth, chalkboard menus and diner style napkins and cutlery, Ice House is pleasant and welcoming, especially considering there really is no sexy way to dig into a bucket of pork ribs or the aforementioned fried chicken, (both available in half or full bucket servings.)

The taco menu also offers you the usual, chicken, steak, seafood and veggie options. You'll find all the other Texan fixens such as popcorn chicken, crab cakes, wings, oyster po-boy's and a brisket sandwich.

You'll wanna know: 
Depending on the day, the bourbon lemonade can set you on a fast-track to a blackout (my personal preference) or taste like liquid sour patch kids. If you prefer consistency, opt for a nice spicy caesar. When you think you've ordered enough, go for one more dish. Sharing is caring after all. Finally, the atmosphere is awesome. Ice House is loud, fun, vibrant, and most probably full of familiar faces. You'll definitely be tempted walk out with your top button undone."}
{"text":"I went into Icehouse after waiting tables tonight, grabbed a beer, half night pint night on Wacky Wednesdays. Yay, can we start meeting here on Weds for a Yelp Office Hours meeting?

P.S. All the single ladies.... go sit at the bar, this is a boy hangout."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny afternoon for drinks & dinner. We got a nice table  on the terrasse and had some great bourbon lemonades. The popcorn shrimp was incredible and the lobster roll was good but NOT WORTH 25$! Omg! The price wasn't advertised and we were shocked when we saw our bills. 

Nevertheless, will definitely come back but will not be getting the roll."}
{"text":"Nowadays in the 21st century perfection is a hard thing to find specially since hip hop died thank you mumble rappers. Anyhow I could go on this subject forever but wtv. Me and 2 of my realest day 1 homies were driving around laval wondering where our next food adventure would be. So my day 1 homie decided to drive us to Icehouse. As I walked in Icehouse me being me started bashing the place until the beef and pulled porc tacos arrived. Let me say this, the last time I witnessed something this epic was when Goku and Vegeta fusioned to be Gogeta. The waiter Francois was super chill, funny and total OG. Strongly suggest everything on the menu cause no joke we took 1 of everything EPICCCCC 
Shoutout to also my day 1 homie to show me this place"}
{"text":"A friend and I passed by Icehouse last Tuesday. I had heard a lot of fairly positive things about it, as well as some grumbling about price... so it was high time that I made it over there to formulate my own opinion. We arrived before 8 o'clock and the place was almost completely full. 

We managed to get seats at the counter on the terrasse, which turned out to be the most awkward restaurant seating I've experienced in a while. The counter is too shallow to comfortably sit straight, yet the chairs are too close together to be able to sit sideways without being forced to play footsie with your neighbor. Not to mention, on a beautiful summer day when you want to sit outside and do some people-watching, you've actually got your back turned to the action and you're facing a wall. Moral of the story: don't sit at the counter.

We started off with the bourbon lemonade, which was very tasty and generous on the booze. I had two of these over the course of the evening and I was definitely tipsy, even after all the food we ate. Yum.

Between the two of us, we shared the fish tacos, the lobster burrito and a side of the jalapenos stuffed with crab. The fish tacos were entirely forgettable - I can't even remember what they tasted like. Probably nothing. The lobster burrito on the other hand, was really really REALLY good. Wow, yum. I think the stuffed jalapenos were good too, but the lobster burrito was so tasty that I went into obsession mode and literally couldn't think of anything else while I was eating it.

We were still hungry, so we decided to order an oyster po boy to share. It was really tasty, but not much like the oyster po boys I've had in New Orleans. I was also thrown off by the fact that the waiter described a po boy as a \"sandwich that basically has anything fried in it\". Not quite, buddy. In any case, I definitely understand the appeal of this sandwich. Messy, saucy and tasty. I really wish there were more oysters though. We cut our sandwich in half and I only had one oyster in my half. (To be fair though, my friend had tons in his half). It was good, but the lobster burrito was better. Or... maybe I was just hungrier when I ate the burrito. Who knows.

The total with tax and tip was well over $100, which, yes, is way too expensive for what it is. But next time, I would just grab a lobster burrito at $20, and that's it. No $9 bourbon lemonade X 2 next time. Okay, so it's not exactly a \"cheap eat\", but cheap lobster is kind of an oxymoron.Service is... not fantastic, but it wasn't BAD either. This is a fun place with a casual vibe, so no, you won't be doted on, but you'll get your food with no problems.

Would I go back? Sure. I probably wouldn't order any fried chicken or ribs because I've spent time in the southern US and I'm not sure that Icehouse can hold a candle to the freakishly good side-of-the-road cheap wonders that I gobbled up down there. 

But it's a fun place. 

Just don't sit at the counter."}
{"text":"Go in with an appetite !! Don't underestimate the small tacos, they are filling. Be sure to top it off with some Bourbon Lemonade, and if you're the hungry type, try the chicken bucket and the ribs. AMAZEBALLS."}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure what to expect from the Icehouse but I actually had a great time.
1/2 price drafts on Wed. nights with a pretty good selection to choose from. They also had live music and I was excited that they had some healthier food items on their menu unlike a lot of other sports bars. I opted for the seared tuna appetizer and it was very tasty. There is also plenty of space to hang out indoors or outdoors. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great location and an awesome selection of beers. Plenty of TV's to watch a game, but unfortunately that is where it ends. Food sucks & the service isn't much better. Took my family there for lunch on a Saturday when it wasn't too busy to give it a second try (first time I went was with 15 buddies and since we didn't have a reservation, they didn't even try to accomodate us. Their loss as we just went down the street and dumped a lot of cash at McKoy's) With it not being too busy, I figured service was going to be attentive. Once our food was delivered, our waitress checked on us and then wasn't to be seen again. I was desperate for a drink after trying the fried pickles... or at least that is what I think they were before the cook decided to keep them in the fryer until they were puck-like. The wife got a Salmon BLT, which reminded me of the old Wendy's commercial, but only with salmon instead of beef. The miniscule portion of salmon was quite disappointing. The pulled pork sandwich wasn't much better and actually reminded me of Mac's... which has gone down hill FAST the past couple of years, but that is another review:)"}
{"text":"Hands down the rudest service I've experienced, staff was particularly unwelcoming and we ended up leaving the table. One star is totally overrated. If the dude serving us was the actual owner, time to learn how to handle your customers!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some Tex-Mex? Then make your way to Icehouse for some deep-fried southern comfort! They do not take reservations and there will most likely be a long line up that takes around 30-45 minutes to get through, so mentally prepare yourself and keep your group limited to 2-3 people since it is a small, but cozy place. A great restaurant to enjoy some bourbon lemonade over their hot and spicy comfort food, their menu is written up on the wall by the open-kitchen and ranges from fried chicken to tacos, to burritos and spicy popcorn shrimp, among many others. They have an interesting variety to choose from, which I have never seen elsewhere in Montreal.

Their tacos are soft, loaded, and come in two's. You probably could not tell with all the filling that takes up most of the space on the plate, but the meat is definitely under it all and comes packed with flavour too. The pulled pork and shrimp were great picks. Next on my 'to try' list? Fried Chicken Tacos. They also have an array of hot sauces to choose from, some of which may definitely clean your colon dry.

Ever heard of a lobster burrito? I definitely have not, not until I came to Icehouse anyway. Apparently it is one of their best menu items, and it better be for $20. Mind you, the burrito is huge; if you split it with someone, paying $10 for it will seem much more appropriate. Loaded with corn, beans, and other typical burrito stuffing, the one thing this mouth-watering wrap was missing was a kick of spicy heat (which I could have added on my own if I was not too busy stuffing my face). The lobster tasted great, soft, and fresh - not in the slightest bit rubber-like or chewy. Definitely a must have! Next on my 'to try' list is their Oyster Po'boy, which looked phenomenal and their Catfish BLT that just sounds fantastical.

The popcorn shrimp was pretty good, I was not expecting it to be spicy but that did not bother me. They are the perfect snack if you are in the mood for something on the smaller, lighter-fried-side and not looking for a heavy meal. Alternatively, the lobster roll can also be considered a lighter option depending on one's appetite. \"Delicious, savoury, an explosion of flavours in your mouth, and totally satisfying,\" are just a few ways my friend described it and she would eat it again in a heartbeat. Next appy-must have? Crab-stuffed Jalapenos, yes you read right.

Icehouse has so much to offer, it blows my mind. It is on the higher end of the price range, and most likely in large part due to the ambiance and popularity, but definitely worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Looking to get out of the University Area for a recent Panthers game, I decided to go to South End area and to Icehouse on South blvd.  This was the second time I've gone to Icehouse and I am more than willing to give this place my stamp of approval.  

Is it the greatest bar of all-time? No, of course not.  Is it the worse bar in the world?  Far from it.  Do I like asking questions, and then answering the very same question I just asked? Of course I do.   

First and foremost, I personally think  Icehouse has the best everyday beer deal in the entire Charlotte area.  They have $2.50, 14.9oz Stella Artois cans - EVERYDAY!  At most places you can't even get a 12oz bud lite bottle for $3.00!! 

I arrived around 7pm on Friday night, my date and I were able to secure a few seats at the bar in front of one of their two 50+ inch screens.  We put in an order of a dozen wings - 1/2 honey bbq, 1/2 hot.  When they arrived at the bar literally smoking hot. They were a bit small in size, but still looked very appetizing.  The wings were sauced perfectly - nice and wet, but not dripping with sauce.  The best part about the wings is that they were nicely charred which added a nice smoking flavor to them. Good sauce + nice smokey flavor + cold ranch = GREAT WING. 

We also ordered the Castro Pizza as the Panthers game moved into the 3rd quarter.  I was a fan of the Castro, especially the black bean puree that was used as a base for the pie.  Do not order the Castro expecting a red, tomato base sauce.  None-the-less, I found it to be bursting with flavor and freshness.  One could easily tell it was made to order.  The veggies, cheeses, and black-beans united in formation in favor of flavor!!

Final thing I have to mention...They have great service here, especially the male bar-tender that was serving my friends and I.  We affectionately referred to him as \"Super Bar Tender\".  We meant it in the highest regard - he was everything you want out of your bar tender - quick, efficient, had some personality but didn't bug you or seem like he was working you for a tip.  

So here's to you Honey BBQ Wings, Castro, and Super Bar Tender - keep up the good work, cheers!"}
{"text":"Both times I have been there the food is average at best, definitely not great.  Basically overpriced bar food.  Waitress screwed up our orders this last time.  Won't be going back, there are much better places."}
{"text":"The place is a hit and miss. When super busy the food is a miss when there are no lineups the food is fantastic. 

The bourbon lemonade is wonderful.  Lobster burrito is good.

The decor is great and atmosphere is wonderful."}
{"text":"Bon au risque d'en choqué plusieurs, j'ai décider d'écrire cet avis.

Je dois dire que je comprends absolument tout le hype pour ce resto et mon opinion reste tout a fait personnel et reflète mon expérience. 

Je dois avouer que malgré les attaques perfides que ce type d'aliment peut faire à ma santé, je suis un fan de ce type de cuisine et que pour moi, il y en a trop peu de qualité à Montréal. Donc comme je passais dans le coin et que j'était curieux vivre par moi même tout le bien que l'on dit du Icehouse, je ne pouvais m'empêcher d'y arrêter. 

Commençons avec les points positifs car il y en a: 
Premièrement l'endroit est super sympa. C'est vivant et même un mardi, c'est plein à craqué. Le service aussi était sympa, malgré un petit problème de communication au début (j'y reviens plus tard)
La limonade (maison) au bourbon est vraiment excellente. Enfin les desserts semblent aussi intéressant. 

Mais bon, pour moi ça s'arrête malheureusement là.
Revenons à mon problème de communication. Puisque l'endroit semble plein, je vérifie si il y a de la place avant de remplir le parcomètre.  On me dit que oui, je remplis le parco et à mon retour, j'apprends que je ne peux manger le poulet au bar. 
Le sympathique serveur me trouve une place sur la terrasse relativement chauffé et malgré le froid (il fait 9*C) je suis déterminé à goûter ce poulet. 

Le service est rapide, peut ètre trop finalement. Le morceau de poitrine n'est pas totalement cuît,comme dirait le chef Ramsey: It's Raw! Pour moi, c'est une faute grave. J'ai déjà vécu les affres d'une volaille sous cuîte et plus jamais on m'y reprendra. 
Le serveur reprends le morceau et je commence a manger les autres. Un deuxième morceau n'est pas cuît :( donc sur les 4, la moitié n'est pas comestible. 
Lorsque le serveur reviens, il me ramène le même morceau mais surcuit cette fois ci. Je décide de na pas lui parler du deuxième morceau. Aussi, malgré le fait que je prennes bien soin de ma personne, que je ne sois pas affligé de maladies honteuses, il me semble que ce n'est pas super de replongé dans l'huile un morceau déjà entamé. Oui je sais, l'huile est bouillante, mais quand même. D'ailleurs ce morceau est maintenant complètement sec et totalement immangeable. 
Courageux, je me convaincs que je ne suis pas venu pour rien et je goûte les morceaux plus petit donc, je l'espère correct. Je ne sais pas si je suis tombé sur un mauvais soir ou si mon karma me rattrape, mais c'était loin d'être à la hauteur de mes attentes. 
Le poulet était sec, la friture insipide et trop grasse et il manque définitivement une sauce pour trempé le poulet. Bbq, épicé, n'importe quoi aurait fait l'affaire. 
Un peu frustré et beaucoup oublié puisque sur la terrasse (seulement une fourchette et ma limonde, pas de napkin ni de verre d'eau) j'ai décidé que j'en avais assez. 35$ pour 2 morceaux à peine mangeable et 1 limonade alcoolisée, c'était trop chère payé. 

Puisque l'endroit est super bien noté et que je n'ai essayer qu'une infime partie du menu, peut être j'y retournerais.
En somme déçu de mon expérience, mais ce n'était peut être qu'un concours de circonstance."}
{"text":"Don't let House of Cards fool you, there's no decent barbecue joint in Washington DC. So when my Texan friend who has been living in Montreal for a decade told me about a BBQ joint he had been meaning to try - I was in. After all, I was at 4 poutines in 3 days and even as a native Quebecois in town just for a few days, I needed a break. 

From the very strict \"wait outside\" policy (I went inside to look at the menu, and I was told to \"take a picture of it and GTFO\") to the waiter who literally splashed us with coleslaw (everywhere on our shirts - didn't apologize) to the ridiculous prices ($20 or a half rack of ribs, with one side, seriously?), Icehouse screamed attitude. 

Their food better be good then. Right? Not really. Popcorn shrimp had amazing breading, with definite Asian influences with the sweet sauce. The ribs were fall off the bone. Good stuff. The fried chicken had also great batter, but the chicken itself had probably been prepared too long and it was dried DRIED. For my friend, all was saved when they brought the corn bread and potato salad (vinegary, thick, excellent). 

For someone in severe BBQ withdrawal, it was fine. I guess that sums it up. 

Note: Posters of shiner bock and all around - and yet you don't serve it? Shame on you."}
{"text":"Creative comfort food served on parchment paper in a hip little corner.

From left to right on the picture are: popcorn shrimps, half-bucket of pork ribs, coleslaw side, and potato salad side. The popcorn shrimps had a very textured and sweet batter (coconut?) with green onions bringing out the flavour. I don't easily get impressed by fried food but this was very good. The ribs were covered by a very sweet un-tangy sauce that I liked a lot. The rib pieces themselves were not all equal: some fatty fall-off-the-bone pieces and others that were dry and invited a toothpick. The sides were adequate. The watermelon and lemon iced tea cocktails had a nice distinctive bourbon sweetness. The food was plenty to split in two, and we paid just under $30 + tip per person.

It's pretty creative on every front, on the food, the drinks, and the setting. I don't find it cheap though, so a 3-star. But it's promising enough for a second visit, maybe a redemption for 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good, no-frills food. Very relaxed atmosphere. Tried the all dressed nachos which were amazing but have to be shared as it is a huge portion. Also had the portobello mushroom tacos which I highly recommend as they were filling but not too heavy. My friend ordered the lobster burrito which she loved as there were huge chunks of lobster in it. Have also tried the steak burrito on a previous visit which was good but huge and very filling, almost needed to be rolled to the car afterwards! Service was great as well, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not as pricey as I thought it would be. I had the bean burrito. It was fairly bland but luckily there was Tabasco on the table. I also had an iced tea and bourbon. There was not much of a tea flavor but tasted like bourbon and water. Not terrible but not what I was expecting. Friendly wait staff and a very cool place to hang out. Next time I might come to hang out just for some beers."}
{"text":"Was there this past weekend for a drink and some munchies. Love the atmosphere, awesome music, nicely surprised. Too bad the pation wasn't open :(

We had a couple of pitchers of bourbon lemonade. It was a beautiful day so this really quenched my thirst. We had the popcorn shrimp and frito-lay pie to nibble on. The pie was decent, and the shrimp were addictive! Almost had a sweet and sour taste to them. 

I was checking out other folks and their dishes, the fried chicken and ribs looked awesome. Nice and messy! Will definitely be back for a meal.

Was a little on the pricey side, but worth it if you want a little treat."}
{"text":"Fried chicken, shrimp po boys and tacos, what more can you ask for. Potentially best service I've ever had. Highly recommend just make sure you don't ask for plates #regularjeans"}
{"text":"First time to IceHouse and we loved it! Brought my nephew and pup, and we had a great experience on the patio. Between the outstanding service from the start (our server brought water out for the dog without having to ask) to the delicious ribs, Mac and cheese, and tomato and basil bisque... we will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Apparently Montreal has some sort of a misty-eyed exoticism about Texas. Being from Texas, I decided to see what America's beret did with beer house cuisine. Tacos, burritos, and sides are available and people kept raving about how \"Texas sized\" the portions were. (They were more of a Texas snack.) I recommend the popcorn shrimp. It was so good that I wanted to cry, which I did when I saw the $100 bill."}
{"text":"Bring your ear plugs! This is a great place to watch sports, but if you plan to talk, go elsewhere. The night I went it was busy and the stereos were blaring. Our table was located directly under a tv and speaker and I found it too loud and impossible to hear anyone...good thing my server could read lips! It's a large and open space with a large patio.

Icehouse serves typical bar food. They offer a couple veggie burgers and one was made with garbanzo beans. It was a bit mushy for me, but I'm glad they offered something new. 

I feel mixed about going back because it wasn't a comfortable atmosphere or memorable food. However, it's in a great location with a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ice house is your standard sports bar.  This place sits in the old Southend Brewery which has moved to charleston.  Cheap drinks, tons of Tvs, and decent outdoor seating with a bar. The price is cheap and its a great place to watch sports.  Be weary though, the food and service is hit or miss.  I have had some of the best ribs of my life here and other times the food was below average. So if you want to come watch some sports are need a quick place to chill this isn't a bad look."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing. Do yourself a favour and share a bucket with friends. Portobello tacos are delicious and my friends really enjoyed the fish tacos although I haven't had a chance to try them yet. Have also had the steak burrito, which was good, but next time I'd stick with tacos and friend chicken. 

The lemonade with vodka is great. 

This place is small, so be prepared to show up early or wait for a seat. You do feel rushed to leave, but that's understandable given that seats are at a premium. Once the patio is open that should help. 

Both times I've eaten here I've been seated at the bar, along the wall. The napkin dispensers on the walls will remind you of school, but you'll soon see that they're really quite useful.

Great place for some kick ass tex mex eats, it's quickly become one of my favourites in Montreal."}
{"text":"After a talk thread involving ribs had the mention of Icehouse having good dry rub ribs (which is what I prefer), I decided to grab the bestie and go try it out.

Located in SouthEnd, I knew where Icehouse was after spotting it while trying to find Big Ben's (lying GPS cow!).  On a Tuesday night around 5:30, it was, as expected, a pretty sparse crowd.  Upon leaving around 7:30, there weren't very many more folks there.  Pretty easy to turn into off of South Blvd, plenty of parking.

Dark, sports bar.  Some tables about, lots of high top bar seating.  My hot date took the wooden chair and left me with the booth side of the table (s'why I love her so).  Lots of TV's.  There seemed to be 1, maybe 2 waitresses working.  Ours was pleasant, though we had to flag her down when things were needed.  Though we were chatting about some pretty serious stuff, so perhaps she was just giving us some space.

The food:
The appetizer was the BBQ Nachos ($12?):  Yes MA'AM!  These were deeeelicious.  Large tortilla chips that held up well to the weight of slow smoked bbq chicken (I swear to dog I thought we ordered pulled pork nachos - I must be losing my mind, or the online menu is wrong), queso (not semi-melted yellow cheese) and the typical nacho toppings, served with roasted salsa that was pretty darn good, and sour cream.  The two of us ate the entire plate - which was a big pile of food.  YUM!  4/5
I ordered the 1/2 rack of dry ribs ($11):    They were decent.  Not the best I have ever had, but good enough.  The first rib I had, which was on the small end of the rack, tasted a little porky (I know, it's pork, but you know what I am talking about), but the flavor improved as I got towards what would be the center of the rack.  They were moist without being greasy, but the extra powdering of the rub, which seemed to come pre-service, was just weird.  I ended up with a face covered in rub-dust (oh, dear).  I had the pasta salad and cole slaw as sides.  Both were run-of-the-mill bar sides.  Tasty, but nothing that changed my life. 3/5
Dessert was the Banana Bread Pudding ($6):  Go get this.  Now.  Two HUGE diagonal-cut slices of a dense bread pudding served with butter pecan ice cream, which was the perfect complement.  So sinful.  So good.  Slightly sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, the banana flavor came through.  Unless you are a competition eater or a giant, get this to share with someone, it is a lot.  4/5

By the time I got home, I was in a food coma.  I would go back to Icehouse again and definitely get the BBQ Nachos and the Banana Bread Pudding."}
{"text":"C'est bon, mais ya beaucoup beaucoup de friture :) cependant les crabcakes étaient pas super :/"}
{"text":"In a small slice of the old gargantuan South End Brewery is Icehouse.  Long gone is the beer making equipment as it was bought by Olde Mecklenburg Brewery. Luckily, Icehouse itself boasts an extensive list of craft and microbrews - so much so that's it difficult to decide.  They have about 12 on tap that rotate and the same amount of seasonals.  The waitress knew a little bit about beer, or at least acted like she did, so that was helpful. She was a good waitress - paying enough attention to us but also letting us enjoy our meal.

The food was decent and reasonably priced.  My burger was good, complete with fried pickles, and my side of veggies was nice and crisp.  The wife's seared tuna tacos served with sides of beans and rice were also good.

Icehouse is a cool little place in South End for a good meal, and if you're a beer snob, it's a must visit."}
{"text":"Pimento Burger was good and large beer selection.  Went on an off time but staff was friendly."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you went to a 5 à 7 that turned into more of a boisterous, flowing 5 à 9, and then you emerge back onto the street feeling a little tipsy and undernourished, wanting something substantial to fill your belly? Maybe you'd planned to go home and cook, but those plans are quickly being squashed by the urgent rumble in your tummy. Well, Icehouse is perfect for that moment.

They don't take reservations, so it can be difficult to get a seat. It was getting on toward 10PM on a Thursday when I went and the place was still full (the patio especially packed), but we managed to score seats at the bar lining the wall, conveniently close to the paper towel dispensers on the wall (these aren't the neatest eats).

I loved the bourbon lemonade and its mix of sweet and sour at just the right alcoholic strength (i.e. not too strong for me, a bit of a wimp that way, but you could definitely taste the bourbon). And the lobster burrito was an amazing combination of textures and flavors. Super satisfying and filling. Yum!

My only complaint is that our meal was quite pricey for what it was. Our bill for two lobster burritos and two tumblers of bourbon lemonade came to almost $75 after tax and tip. That said, it would have been more reasonable had we not chosen lobster - the other mains are less expensive.

I'll definitely return and try some other items on the menu (the tacos, for example). All in all, this is one of the most original places I've tried in Montreal in recent years."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. So unprofessional. Never got half our food and left. Stressful awful experience"}
{"text":"The short review... Tons of TVs and crappy bar food. I'll echo other Yelpers and endorse the BBQ chicken nachos. Skip the burger... overpriced and underwhelming. Keep your expectations realistic and you'll be happy with Icehouse."}
{"text":"PROS:

1. Savorful, hearty, drool-worthy food. We had the lobster burrito, wings, and so much more. Everything was really good but the lobster burrito hit it out the ballpark for me. The drinks are not too strong and complement the food really well. 

2. Service is fun and friendly. The atmosphere of the place is very cool and relaxed. Great place for drinks and food at night.

CONS:

1. Pricey but I'd say it's a place you'd only go once in a blue moon, so the cost is worth it.

OVERALL:

-I'd recommend it and would go back.
-Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Ok, here's the thing.. I like Icehouse ok.  I've met my husband there for lunch several times.  I've just not been wowed by the two big things I look for in a dining establishment.  Food and service.

The food is ok.  I can't say I've had anything that's really bad, but nothing really memorable, either.  Once, the buttermilk fried chicken was super good, but on a repeat visit, it was tough and the gravy was watery.

As for service, I've not been impressed at all.  I've only ever seen female waitstaff, but they never smile, or try to convey that they're remotely interested that anyone is there.  It makes for a rather boring experience, in my opinion.  I'm not saying they need to sit down and ask for my life story, but at least smile.

I'm not saying I won't go back, I probably will, but this place is way down on my list of places I would enjoy frequenting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourites in the city. There is so much delicious food, from the fish tacos to the brisket or the absolutely addicting fried chicken. Also don't forget to have the bourbon lemonade. No matter what you pick, you will be delighted with the food at Icehouse. I highly recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Icehouse but this was by far the worst experience Ive had. The only plus side was the barman who didn't ignore me and my friend and made us an awesome bourbon lemonade. 

So we arrived to a waiting line and we got to sit outside to wait before getting in. Ppl kept coming in and the terrace got full pretty fast. The ppl already sitting when we arrived had drinks so I expected the waitress to come over to us and ask our drink order but no, in fact the ppl who kept coming in after us got that privilege. So we just sat there wondering if it was our faces she didn't like or our choice of clothing, anyway she completely ignored us until we got called in to sit inside 40 mins after we arrived. Luckily the barman noticed us and offered us drinks. 

So we sat there and drank for about I would say 30 mins looking at the ppl who just sat down getting their orders taken. At that point I was ready to leave but I was starving the car was far and it was cold out so we just waited. Ppl who came in after us were already eating. I had dragged my friend there so she was giving me this look of like girl why you hate me so much lol.  Finally this other waitress came to us and was like have you been served and my friend said \"ummm no\" so we asked what was good and she suggested the mahi mahi taco. We also split a steak burrito and fries. 

So food arrives. First the burrito,  the menu said it would come with cheese sauce but I guess they replaced that with soggy fries and jalapeño. I was confused because the menu ingredient for the burrito didn't include fries and not a mention of how spicy it was and I can handle some heat. Then the taco. Another disappointment as it had jalapeño as well and we were not tasting anything at this point. It fell apart in my hand and it tasted awful. The fried fish was soggy and was covered with so much batter that you could barely see the fish inside. 

We just wanted to leave so we went to the cash and waited another 15 mins of the 2 waitresses walking by us ignoring our presence. Not even a \" ill be with you in a min\" our waitress decided to clean our table spot while we waited standing like tourists. 

I really don't see what the big fuss with this place is about and I rarely leave a bad review but this was just such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really cool.  Great place to go with friends and to watch sports.  I love their local selection of craft brews.  The wings were good and the fish tacos were nice too.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Great service...tried the wings and BBQ sloppy Joe. Overall good experience. Kid friendly if you can get a booth against the wall."}
{"text":"Overhyped. Long wait. overpriced. Ive been to a lot of bbq joints thats why I was not impressed. The chicken batter was tasteless. The batter is so important to any fried food and if the batter is lacking seasoning you failed the entire dish. The ribs were basic bbq ribs that you can get anywhere. the vegetarian burrito was lacking flavour. Overall it is alright but not worth the price and there are better places out there. The bourbon Lemonade was good.

I do enjoy the outdoor patio and atmosphere is good for a friends night out but could use a lot of salt, pepper and cayanne. The place is also very small is not good for large groups."}
{"text":"Restaurant sympathique de l'extérieur, avec une belle terrasse. Mais nous avons attendu longtemps avant d'être servis ! Et plutôt déçus : c'est très TRES gras et huileux. Même pour des burritos/fajitas/... c'est trop !"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend (visiting from out of town) and we were both impressed with our experience at the Icehouse. Service was great and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. The server suggested that we grab a range of dishes and then share between us which was a good idea. We had the fried chicken, the ribs, coleslaw, potato salad and fries and it was more then enough! Didn't get chance to try the tacos but they looked good from what I saw others eating.

The only strange thing I found was that they don't have a handout menu that you can have a read of at the table. The whole menu is on a giant board at the front of the restaurant which is no big deal but a strange decision.

Shout out to the friendly, bubbly girl that kept coming around with water and took our payment."}
{"text":"WOW

Icehouse va vraiment de flaberguaster. C'est de la bonne bouffe. J'allais dire mexicaine à cause des choix de tacos et burritos, mais je crois que c'est plus du genre américain.

La bouffe est juste trop bonne, vous aller vouloir tout essayer. Je conseille d'y aller avec un ami et d'échanger les plats, car la majorité arrive en paquet de deux.

Les crevettes pop-corn sont très bonnes aussi comme plate d'accompagnement.

Pour boire, il faut vraiment prendre un pichet de limonade. Juste un, car le sucre tombe sur le coeur après un au complet pour deux personnes.

J'y retournerais n'importe quand pour leur trop bon tacos."}
{"text":"This past weekend I went to Icehouse for lunch. I have to say the service was right on point, but I was also sitting at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and made me a good Bloody Mary so no complaints about service or drinks from me. I started with the Slow Smoked Barbecue Chicken Nachos, they were amazing! I probably gained a few pounds after that appetizer, but it was worth it =) I also got the blackened tilapia sandwich and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I love tilapia and even though tilapia is not the most flavorful fish, the blackened seasoning was barely there and the sandwich was bland, but on a positive note I loved the fries. This is for sure a good place to go watch a game, and have some drinks. I like the service and the atmosphere and I'm definitely going back for some more nachos."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place last night. We managed to grab a table at around 7pm on a Wednesday night so I think that as long as it's not the weekend, you'll find a comfy table for small groups. 

Started off with a pitcher of the bourbon lemonade ($40), which is deliciously sweet and strong. Honestly, I would go back just for that. We weren't starving so we ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer ($12) and 4 orders of tacos (8 total tacos). We got 4 mahi mahi tacos ($16), 2 portobello tacos ($8) and 2 pulled pork tacos ($8). I can't speak to the pork tacos but I really loved the mahi mahi tacos. The portobello tacos were good for vegetarians but lacked the punch I tasted in the fish tacos. My favourite thing was the popcorn shrimp appetizer. Sweet, tangy and spicy simultaneously! 

All in all, Icehouse has great food, drinks and ambiance. Love the terrace in the summer! Next time I go, I'll prob try the fried chicken and sides."}
{"text":"The first thing that attracted me to this place was their outdoor patio which is right out in front of the restaurant. It's the perfect place to sit on a sunny day to watch the passing people parade on Rue Roy.

The second thing I liked was the service which was very attentive.

So we ordered beers and wine from a decent selection and also the bucket of fried chicken which arrives at your table in a metal bucket which is then dumped onto the table which has been covered with butcher paper. The chicken was very good and I like how it was presented.

I don't know when I'll be in Montreal again, but I would return here again."}
{"text":"I'm not really convinced this is a place where I would love to come to after work or to just eat. The place is pricey and as for their food, it's not really filling. 

However, they do have a pretty big beer selection. If I were to come here it would probably be just to come and drink and maybe order an appetizer. I enjoyed it though as the service wasn't bad and my coworkers and I had fun. If you're choosing for beer, go here. If you're looking for somewhere to chow down, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Le IceHouse est un endroit de pure décadence, où se côtoient sans jugement garçons et filles de tous âges prêts à se gaver comme s'il n'y avait pas de lendemain. Cuisine texane à son meilleur, mon conseil est d'y aller en groupe plutôt qu'en couple, car vous aurez envie de goûter à tout, au grand malheur de votre estomac qui je l'espère tuffera la run jusqu'à la dernière bouchée. 

Les assiettes sont généreuses et les prix justes. Prenez un burrito (les plus courageux/les-vrais-de-vrais le prendront \"dirty\" pour +6$), et séparez-vous un bucket de poulet frit (le seul que j'accepte de manger, parce qu'on me le sert renversé direct sur la table préalablement tapissée d'un élégant papier craft). À votre disposition: Plusieurs dizaines de sauces piquantes (dont plus de la moitié sont faites maison, avec en prime une réserve secrète de sauces dangereuses pour ceux qui n'ont plus de papilles gustatives) et une moutarde au miel qui se mangerait à la cuillère tellement elle est bonne. L'expérience vient accompagnée de salade de patate et crémeuse au choux, ainsi que de divins biscuits qui fondent dans la bouche. Vous n'aurez plus faim, mais je vous oblige à prendre des chili cheese fries, parce que ma vie n'est plus la même depuis que j'ai goûté à leur version servie avec moutarde jaune. Pour finir, ou plutôt pour commencer, n'oubliez pas de vous commander un pichet de limonade au bourbon, parce qu'avec autant de nourriture, vous allez avoir besoin d'un peu d'alcool pour vous convaincre à la mi-repas que vous avez encore de la place pour finir tous les plats qui vous auront fait céder."}
{"text":"Southern style comfort food served on a large parchment paper lined on the table. The highlight of our dinner was definitely having the bucket of BBQ ribs or the fried chicken poured over the parchment paper on the table. It was just so much fun to grab the food and eat it with your hands. Every \"bucket\" of food was accompanied by coleslaw and potato salad (there was in my opinion nothing special about the sides).

My favourites were by far the fried chicken (extra crispy and very filling), the beef ribs (large, very saucy) and the fish tacos (so crispy and fresh). Make sure to come early or during a nice and sunny day because there aren't many tables indoors."}
{"text":"Dont understand what is not to like about this place. Popped in during world cup on way to airport and the place was packed, service was attentive without getting in the way and the beer selection was enormous. Glad to see that this area is coming back with the addition of Icehouse. its a sprots bar- Food was good for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Seems like a great place to stop in and watch the game and for that I'm sure my boyfriend will be back. 

The beer and drink selection is pretty good and relatively inexpensive but the food is nothing to write home about. I was really unimpressed with my tacos. My boyfriend got a salmon dish that had WAY too much salt in the sauce. It was almost inedible. 

I'm sure he'll be back for games, but he'll have to do some major convincing to get me to return -I'm not a big sports fan, after all. It does, however, lend itself well to bigger groups."}
{"text":"Les nachos étaient delicosos! Belle terrasse, et  service attentif à nos besoins. Par exemple, alors que nous allions commander plusieurs plats, le serveur nous a averti que cela serait peut être trop de nourriture pour nous. De plus, aussi bien pour un groupe d'amis que pour un souper avec des plus jeunes. Atmosphère relax et sans prétention."}
{"text":"Best steak salad ever!!!!  Been searching for this and I found it!

Amazing nachos as well! 

Service is alright, for sure don't go to be wowed by that :)"}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken and tacos. Tacos were very mediocre, had much better. Pieces of fried chicken were over cooked, and others were undercooked. Cooks don't seem to understand that pieces of chicken of different size need to be cooked different amount of time. 

Waiter was kind of rude, he threw the chicken down onto the table (no reason why), getting sauce and oil all over my cashmere sweater. 

Maybe if you're into dark and extremely casual diners that smell like BO you'll be into this.

Also, waiter insisted that I sit at a table right in front of the door where there is a draft and people entering that will hit you, despite four other tables being open. Smh."}
{"text":"Just went into Icehouse to watch football on a Sunday! Been going there for football on Sundays for close to a year. We spend $100-$150 each week. I'm sitting next to a few Steelers fans on the patio. My Bucs vs Steelers game is on a TV so we sit there. After a few minutes, the game gets changed? No big deal, we ask one of the waitresses to put it back. She rolls her eyes and walks away. 5 minutes later, the manager (he was a  fan with a Bucs tattoo) walks over to us and says \"Im not changing any TV's.\" No \"Hello\" or \"Can I help you guys\"? Very aggressive, short and rude! I say \"The game was on and that's why we sat here.\" He says \"Im trying to run a business here!\" Terrible way to treat a customer! I asked the bartender for my check and told her why I was leaving! She was sweet and apologetic! The Steelers group, who were sitting next to me, also asked for their checks to leave! I didn't even know them! One of the ladies said she was in the business (F & B) and said that manager was so unprofessional and out of line! Wr all took our business elsewhere because this manager was an absolute jerk! I will never, ever patronize Icehouse again! There are so many options to watch football uptown! Icehouse is not a place you should go!"}
{"text":"Portobello and Poulet Frit was so tasty and packed. Though, could have added a bit more guacamole.  The place is rusty and has a great vibe. It gets busy. Open long hours and patio is just right for a beer. They have beer from west cost micro breweries to local MTL beer. Close to Saint Laurent busy area and also a bit quiet just cause it's a block off the main street."}
{"text":"So it's really late and we wanted to go out for drinks and a bite. The place we'd originally wanted was packed to the rafters so we started to walk back to the car when...there was Icehouse. 2 folks from Ottawa, one from Toronto and my partner and myself - we were greeted promptly and the friendly and welcoming service continued right through the experience. Drinks were not only great but special requests were accommodated without a second thought. I am in love with the bourbon lemonade, so refreshing and wickedly wonderful.  We sat out on the porch and had THE best time. Didn't want too much to eat but the old fashioned beef tacos really hit the spot. The Ottawa folks asked for some of the fried chicken with one taking the coleslaw and the other the potato salad. The raves over the chicken, the incredible corn bread kept coming with superlatives being added with almost every mouthful. I personally loved the potato salad though some found it too sweet. The coleslaw was just right. I can't wait to go back there and really dive into some of their other dishes. What a find! What a treat!"}
{"text":"Good place for some beers (lots to choose from) while watching some sports games. Came on a Saturday night for the first stop of a self organized bar crawl and all the tables were full! So we just bum rushed the bar. Nice, open space with a lot of seating and many, many flat screens. Will have to venture back one of these days to try out the food.

For future reference, it's 3 blocks from the East/West Blvd light rail stop, which is a block more than comfortable on a really, really cold night."}
{"text":"The food is lush, striking the right balance of southern decadence and class. I've found that the quality varies somewhat, but I've yet to be dissatisfied. The decor is inviting and rustic, and the lighting is pleasantly minimal in the evenings. The service is friendly and speedy, but you may outright be asked to leave if too many people are waiting outside. 

If there's one thing that needs work, it's the hard-to-read, half-unlit chalkboard menu. It's a terrible system to has led to me missing out on tasty menu items.

The bourbon lemonade, popcorn shrimp and mahi-mahi tacos are all fantastic. The crab guacamole nachos are limp and lacking in taste. The lobster burritos are not worth the price. The \"old-school\" tacos are delightful.

In other words, it's not perfect, but I'm very glad it's there."}
{"text":"This Thursday night the Icehouse was packed with football fans and people who just appreciate a large beer selection.  I don't have much experience on their food but the staff have been great."}
{"text":"Really good food. Hearty flavors that span Asian to Southern. My kids love the barbecue sandwiches. My wife loves their Thai Beef Salad. With new place, a little inconsistency is normal as tweeking occurs, however the value is good for the quality of food. I'd go here over 15 North anytime for a meal.  Service depends on who you get - ask for your favorite server if possible (once you find him/her).  Good service should be rewarded and acknowledged."}
{"text":"I'm a little conflicted about Icehouse. I want to love this place - it has all the things that I love: tacos, nachos, sunshine, a totally casual vibe and a patio. 

On the other hand, dinner for four of us was $200 and we ended up feeling a bit underwhelmed and hungry - we grabbed more snacks afterwards. 

The four of us had: a pitcher of a bourbon lemonade cocktail, 3 dozen oysters on the half shell, 6 tacos, an order of fried chicken, and an order of the crab nachos. 

The food was all good, but nothing really stood out as amazing. The nachos were a generous portion - but really expensive. I think they were close to $30. 

All in all, I would come back for cocktails and split the basic nachos with friends but that's it. For what we spent, I think we were expecting to be wowed."}
{"text":"My favorite fried chicken in Montreal at a reasonable price with a belt of dipping sauces! The crab cakes taste freshly made and I don't normally drink alcohol but the whiskey lemonade makes me want to drink it like it's water. It's the closest I've gotten to \"southern\" food in Montreal. Makes me miss home in Virginia!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Charlotte all my life I've never been here.  Driven by it and gave it the \"hey, that looks like a cool place\".  

Finally popped in on a nice Saturday afternoon and found the patio.  It was obviously the place to be.  Packed and a nice crowd having a good time.  My kind of place.  I was on a little time crunch and the wait staff responded perfectly with the timing of drinks and our lunches.  

The interior, although we didn't get seated there, looked warm and inviting, spacious even.  The patio is a combination of tables and chairs with picnic tables and a large bar."}
{"text":"Love Ice House! Parmi mes restos préférés à Montréal. Le style de la cuisine est différent de ce qu'on retrouve ailleurs et c'est excellent."}
{"text":"Just a nice bar, grilled wings are awesome! Kitchen close at 10 PM on weekends so hurry. Drinks are good price is reasonable. Oh had a side salad and fries nothing special about these at all. But again grilled buffalo  wings that are not fried, yep the best may need to ask for extra sauce can't really taste it."}
{"text":"I bought a Living Social coupon to try this place out. The actual structure is very nice. Cool side of town, but the food and beer, which is why we went, was less than stellar. Pretty expensive without the discounts. The beer list was nothing to call home about. I could have gotten every  beer at Harris Teeter. My \"CAROLINA BURGER\" was fine, not worth 9.99, that's for sure. Our waitress looked very bored and just did the minimum. I left a nice tip so she could cheer up for the rest of the night. But she definitely didn't earn it. No reason to return to this place, sorry to say.


Side note: I know the economy is crap and most people are having a hard time. I want to help support local businesses, so when I go to a local business and see a 10$ hamburger, a 6$ bottle of beer and a staff that could care less if you're there or not. It makes me feel like staying home and not dealing with the aggravation."}
{"text":"i so want Icehouse to be good, but it isn't.  Food is meeehhh, not horrible, but not special.  Service is non existent.  great location, but just not a destination spot."}
{"text":"Great texas ambience, very friendly staff and awesome tex-mex menu. Definitely a place to come back often."}
{"text":"Good food. The hummus appetizer was fantastic. The Greek
Pizza was good yet a little salty. Maybe I'd remove the olives next time. Good service. The waitress was good. My specialty drinks weren't that fabulous. I had a margarita and it was too sour!! I will go back."}
{"text":"Great lobster burrito and the nachos are very tasty. The place is tiny and they make you wait outside. The waitress was rude but also rushed. The food made up for the lack of service ."}
{"text":"Come early to get a table, Icehouse takes no reservations and is tiny. Recently we mosied in at 6:30 on a Friday with a group of 4, sat down at the last available table and had a pitcher of bourbon lemonade within minutes. We watched 3 other groups come in right behind us and then leave.

Icehouse isn't fancy, it's just central, tiny, friendly and no fuss. Plastic trays, no plates, no menus but everything we tried was undeniably tasty. The prices could be better but the bill at the end of the night still seemed cheap to our Toronto friends, and the food is really filling and flavorful. The $20 lobster burrito got rave reviews, I loved the cheese stuffed jalapenos and my deep fried oyster po'boy."}
{"text":"I went to Icehouse when they first opened last year and was not impressed. This weekend I decided to give them a second shot, and I am so glad I did. Their Cuban sandwich was absolutely amazing. I'll be going back time and time again for it. The chicken and black bean egg rolls are light on chicken, heavy on the beans and we loved them as well!"}
{"text":"This place is great for your run of the mill, work downtown under 35 crowd. That's not my crowd, but that's obviously who this place was designed for.

The bottled selection is good and their rotating drafts are good as well - I do like seeing their iced down bottle display :) We sat at the bar and I had a chicken pita with pineapple mango salsa and a side salad with balsamic. Both were very good, and the bartender was very accommodating and attentive.

On the down side, this place got loud quickly, so I wouldn't recommend going there after 830pm if you want to have a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"Note**-This is a sports bar. Do not come here if you are expecting a great Surf & Turf special. With that said, THIS PLACE IS GREAT!
 
There's nothing better than football Sundays. Throwing back cold beers..finger food...watching football...with good company.

One of my favorite things about this place is that they show EVERY game that's on. It's up to you to find a good spot where you can follow the game/s of your choice. Being new to the area, I appreciate this very much.  

I mistakenly wound up at a bar a few weeks ago to realize that they would ONLY show the Cleveland browns on the 25 TV's they had. I missed the entire first quarter of a NY Giants game by the time I found a place that would show the game. That will never be an issue here.

They have an huge selection of beers on draft as well as bottle. Service is pretty good for what you would expect on a busy Sunday. The food is SOLID. You can't really ask for more out of a place like this -- Wings, nachos, burgers, wraps, they're all good for what the place is ( A sports bar). Again, I cant

After trying numerous sports bars in the area, this will be my go-to from now on. It's conveniently located down South BLVD and right on the light rail. They have a great outdoor patio as well. If you have never been here before, make sure you stop by to check it out."}
{"text":"Okay so I would say that this is similar to Grumman78 but much much much smaller and more food options (good sized buckets of ribs and chicken to share with a couple friends). Different flavours of burritos and tacos but also other stuff so you'll probably be able to find something you like. I had a chicken burrito and jalapeño poppers.. Honestly I wouldn't come here for burritos again, but the jalapeño poppers were tasty so I imaging that other stuff is tasty too.. But the burrito had very litte flavour, but the fries were tasty, crispy and salty/flavourful (not included with burrito). 


They do have a number of fun hot sauces to try (at no extra cost of course), one was in the millions of Scoville units, it's fun to try and dare your friends.

The iced tea that I ordered tasted like salt - not like a real iced tea (despite it being homemade in house).

I think that it a chill fun and unique place to try, I would go again with a group of friends to hang out but I wouldn't go with the sole intention of eating their food - although it's by no means bad, I just wouldn't crave it as nothing really stood out, except maybe the poppers.

Fyi expect to have to wait a bit for your table, but they have heaters outside to help you not freeze while waiting on their patio even in pseudo winter weather."}
{"text":"Waitstaff wasn't impressive. Food was okay, decent prices. Really neat building though, very spacious."}
{"text":"The pork nachos are my favorite! The waitresses are very nice, the drinks are pretty good... Nice place to visit for dinner or to watch football."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, the fish tacos were to die for. Both of my friends ordered burritos and were extremely satisfied. Most of their produce were harvested from local farms which enhanced the flavors and the overall experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 2 friends. We ordered the fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, and the fried fish sandwich. It's cool how they dump the fried chick on the table. The fried chicken was a bit dry. The fish sandwich was really good. The popcorn shrimp was a bit greasy. I also got a pink bourbon lemonade, and my friends got the regular bourbon lemonade, both are must tries! The pink one has a slight fruitier taste. The service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"Hey it's a bar!  Actually a decent place with decent food and a large beer selection.

I stopped in here for a bite to eat for something different than my usual late night places.  The staff was friendly and the pizza I ordered was actually decent for bar food.  

There are TV's throughout the place for your sports game viewing.  They have a big patio that is enclosed in colder months.

I just wonder why it took me so long to try this place."}
{"text":"I want to preface my review by stating that I have never had a \"regular\" meal here. By \"Regular,\" I mean that I haven't had a typical sit down lunch or dinner here.

 I have on the other hand been here a number of times for happy hour or for a late night drinks and apps with friends, or on the weekends to watch college football or pro football. I like the set up here. lots of tvs, modern bar, high tables. 

The beer selection is solid here. Not as many as Taco Mac, but definitely still good. And to be honest, my first few visits here I kind of stuck to basic appetizers, but later I tried sandwiches and tacos and really enjoyed them. I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I've always sat at the bar. The service at the bar is fine, not sure about the servers at the tables.

Overall I'd recommend this place to hang out. Great place to catch a game, grab a drink and have some bar food too."}
{"text":"When the waitress dumped the fried chicken onto our table, it was soooo greasy (dripping with oil) and you can tell that they hadn't changed their frying oil because it was so dark. The skin was not edible and the meat was dry. Yuck. The drinks were decent though, I'll give them that. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We showed up at 6:45 and were lucky to get the last two-top. Felt bad for the people after us because they had to wait outside (it is -10 tonight).

The handwritten menu on a board it was hard to see - the writing is small (I wear glasses) and some parts have no light at all. Ordered the shrimp ceviche (on special) and popcorn shrimp and a bourbon lemonade. 

Bourbon lemonade was way sweet, had very little lemon, and maybe had a shot. For $10. Waited at least 30 minutes for our food. This I didn't mind so much. Shrimp ceviche: the portion was palm-sized. Tasted good. They brought us a shrimp po boy - not popcorn shrimp - but my companion was too hangry to complain. I didn't complain because it was loud, so maybe it was an honest mistake. Anyway... The remoulade on top was very, very sweet, it was too much. The shrimp themselves were good but they got so soggy in that sauce. (I'm from the South, no sauce is that sweet.) For the portion sizes and taste, it wasn't a good value. We paid $40 including tip and came away hungry. We could've ordered a bucket of chicken for almost the same price. 

The service was friendly and they were enthusiastic about the menu. They were really nice. It gets loud. Just depends on if you're in the mood for a rowdier setting.

It's really unfortunate that we weren't pleased with our meal. I've read reviews where when it's not packed its good, and just forget it if it is crowded. I have to agree. But I was so disappointed, I won't be back."}
{"text":"While I still am not completely sold on food here I have had some great experiences just grabbing some drinks with friends.

I came after Nikko on my bday and the bartender comped a round of shots for my friends and I - nice touch! No, they weren't cheapy ones either, I actually was able to pick the drink.

I can find almost any beer I am looking for - from Purple Haze, to my home-brew Saranac they have it covered and at a reasonable price. I had 5 beers on my tab and paid a measly $17! If that is still too pricy they had a bud/bud light $2 special which I thought was more than reasonable. Perhaps my favorite feature is that they are able to keep your tab open but still give you your card - as a naturally forgetful person this has been great.

On Saturdays they have great music on the patio from 8:30-11:30- which is not to be missed! They play all the favorites ( and span several musical genre's ) and take requests. They also garner a nice crowd, I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place is atmosphere and shear phun!!!  Either a love it or hate it relationship will exist after you've visited and for me I love it and come almost every Friday night... I sooooo need it!   I cannot continue through to the next week until I have my chicken taco and a cold pitcher of Creemore.   It's no frills Tex-Mex and you are going to get messy.  Paper towels on the walls and a sheet of brown paper on the table, what more do you need... utensils?  Hipsta please!  Pass anyone of the 25 hot sauces and lets get at it.

I love it at the Icehouse and can understand how some can be taken aback a wee bit... well a lot of if they come unprepared and unaware.  Yes... you may wait on a busy night, but take a peek as to how small the place is. So take it for what it is and get used to it, cause Icehouse is an experience as much as it is most likely the best Tex-mex in this city."}
{"text":"so i went there right when they opened and it left me @ meh.... then my lady friend who lives a block from it took me back there and it was really good, we went back again saturday night and i felt compelled to write a short review about how much i like the place, its bar its great.  first time i went there i sat down at a table and got some weird jerk chicken deal...not good.  last two times we have sat @ the bar and i have gotten the tune both times, it super super tasty and cooked perfectly, seared blackened crust with cool red/raw center exactly the way i like it.  plus they have an absurd beer selection which melikey a lot.  i'll probably end up frequenting this place and she likes it so go try it for yourself.

i mean they have kronenbourg 1664 my favorite beer on menu, its a random french beer that i FN love"}
{"text":"i went here for the first time yesterday and i was not that impressed. i was in the mood for a burger so i ordered there texmex burger. which i thought was gonna be different because of the guacamole but spicy because of the pepper jack cheese. NOT. my burger taste like a plain cheeseburger with wayy too much lettuce. i was kinda disappointed. on the bright side the vodka & redbull was $5 and they have a million flat screens so i was able to watch some basketball. our waitress was also really nice. i just wish there food was better because the location itself is great."}
{"text":"Oh noes, Icehouse. I was really excited to bring some out of towners to this new restaurant/pub seated in the heart of South End. The building itself is really neat - super tall ceilings, a nice patio facing South Blvd. and tons of super sweet flat screens inside. This would be a great place to watch a game...but not to eat...and here's why. 

Four of us were seated and ordered all different things off the menu - chicken tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp and spinach quesadillas and I ordered the Thai beef salad. Even as we ordered, we thought that some of the menu items looked a little pricey as depicted. But, as this is a new restaurant we didn't quite know what to expect. The food came out very quickly - quite literally within 5-10 minutes, which was good. But the outcome was not. My mother ordered the shrimp and spinach quesadillas and upon tasting them, she put them down and asked me to try them. The spinach had a metallic, almost chemical taste to it. Within five minutes the waitress came over and she offered to bring her something else, later stating that too much oregano was reason that the quesadillas tasted strange. No offense, but I cook with oregano often, and that wasn't the odd taste. 

My husband's shrimp tacos were fine, but we took issue with the fact that for $12 - all he received were two small tacos with no sides. And my father's chicken tacos - $9 for the same. Even if these tacos were stellar (which per my dining mates they were just ok), that is a paltry amount of food for the price. The only decent item at the table was my Thai Beef Salad - the seasoning was nice, the mint was a pleasant touch, I just wish it had a little more spice. Portion wise it was more than enough. 

As a replacement to the spinach quesadillas, my mother ordered the Thai beef spring rolls and they were positively swimming in oil. Now, I don't mind a fried item, but lifting up a spring roll and finding a large pool of oil isn't appetizing to anyone. Needless to say, she didn't eat very much at lunch. On a brighter note, Icehouse has an extensive and affordable beer selection that would please just about anyone. 

Overall, I like the concept and the feel of Icehouse - plenty of brews and plenty of tvs. The food, however, fell waaaay short. I really hope that this place reevaluates its menu as the location and the concept have a lot of potential."}
{"text":"A-OK is a good description for Icehouse.

Patio: probably the best feature about this place. Complete with a bar and TVs... it's a great spot to grab a beer on a nice evening.

Food: I've had a little bit of everything off the menu. It's all been just okay. One bright spot on the menu: the barbecue chicken nachos. Pretty tasty. If you're looking for a good snack and drinks, stop here and get them.

Bar: wide beer selection that can fit any price range. Different specials every night.

I love the space. Lots of TVs and a fun atmosphere to watch a game. Is it one of my go-to spots for sports? No. Do I like coming here? Absolutely. With so many options in Charlotte, it ranks in a mid level spot on my list."}
{"text":"I rolled in here the other night with Yelper Extraordinaire Matthew P. and was blown away by the food.

The nachos we had to start we're fresh and awesome with plenty of toppings and more than enough (but not too much!) cheese - no sloppy nachos here.

We (four of us) the shared a serving of fried chicken tacos, half a bucket of fried chicken, some jalapeño poppers, and we washed it all down with a pitcher of beer. Everything was great.  Sure, almost everything was fried, but I would argue that's WHY it was GREAT. 

Apparently they use a method of frying called \"chicken frying\", which (strangely enough) doesn't always involve chickens... Whatever. It tastes great. Especially the fried chicken taco, which basically re-defined the dish for me - I now know why I had to fight Matthew for one of them, and why he fought like a wild dog over a bone for it.

Same thing for the fried chicken - absolutely fantastic. If you can handle your friend food, then you need to try it. It's not even that fried, so don't worry about taking out extra life insurance.

The atmosphere and decore is spot on too; nothing too fancy, but keeps with the theme of the food, and is cool. They've got a nice outdoor section which I'm looking forward to try as soon as it's open this year!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good but for tacos it is was pricey. Not a lot of seating either. I had the lobster taco which was 20$ but was small. Drinks are good though. They only have one Bench for a large group other than that go with only one friend."}
{"text":"The Menu is kinda like a nice short story.. a la Edgar Allen Poe (my fav. short story writer). Saying that to say.... ITS TOO MUCH STUFF ON IT!!!

Food is pretty good. I like the WINGS, (1/2 dozen for 6 bucks UN-HEARD-OF...... DOZEN = 10.95). 

BBQ BACON SWISS....... good!!!!
FRIES......GOOD (I'M THE ORIGINAL \"FRY GUY\")

CAROLINA PULLED PORK SANDWICH..... 8.25 (WHAAAAA???  8 BUCKS FOR A SLOOPY JOE SANDWICH..... NO BUENO)

OTHER than that.... I don't go too far outside those optiions. When I'm here, I'm posted up at the bar or somewhere with a friend for drinks and a ez bite to eat.. & NOT a Dinner location for me. (Distance..not the Food). 

When you enter the place you may just want to stand and wait for someone to seat you. THAT'S a crap shoot.... maybe someone will.......maybe you they won't. 

They did a great job on the patio. Bartenders seem to be on point.
No reason for anything negative for this place... I like it and tell ppl about it. 

Cheer's!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for sports viewing.  Usually good about getting the game on you want to watch.  Best wings in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the Icehouse. The first couple times I went with friends were awesome. The Bourbon lemonades, the crab-filled jalapeno poppers and the fish tacos are amazing. They also make this awesome watermelon-tequila drink of which you will dangerously want a whole picher for yourself!! But lately I took my boyfriend there since I had been craving for more of their awesome food and we were extreeeeemely disapointed. The cheese-sauce and steak burrito is such a bummer, filled with french fries (why??) and it was way too sloppy. But that was nothing compared to the fried chicken. There are no words to express how bad that was - hard as rock, badly frie chunks of chicken. I give it a 3 stars because their drinks and apps are great but I would definitely recommend you stick to the basic tacos and avoid the chicken bucket!!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my landlord, who suggested many other good things in the area, so I thought I would try out the Icehouse. Since it's only about 100 feet away from me, I figured it was only a matter of time before I stopped in for a beer anyway. 

When I heard they had good bourbon lemonade, I was sold, since it's pretty hard to find good bourbon outside of the U.S. The bourbon lemonade was pretty tasty, though fairly pricey as well, considering that it is not very strong. I know alcohol is more pricey in Canada in general, especially for things like imported bourbon (they use Maker's Mark in their drinks). But, I couldn't help but think that the bourbon lemonade was all part of the owner's business plan to serve people salty food that they greedily wash down with sweet, expensive drinks in order to run up their bills.

The menu features all kinds of regional American cuisine, though you'd never be able to eat the things they serve here at a single place in America. For BBQ, you go to a BBQ place. For seafood, you go to a seafood place. For tacos, you go to a taco place. Once more, you're not likely to find great seafood and great bbq in many of the same geographical regions in the U.S., so not only would it be hard to find these items in the same restaurant, but it would be hard to eat them all in the same state.

The fish tacos my table ordered were quite delicious. I did not eat any of the oysters the table ordered, though they reported they were delicious as well. 

We enjoyed everything for the most part until the bill came - everything was priced a bit higher than we would've expected.

The place is very tiny inside - it looks more enjoyable when the patio is open."}
{"text":"This is the happy hour spot of choice for my firm. They have a good beer selection and a lot of TVs to watch the game. Their hot wings are amazing and the tacos are also delicious. A great place to see a game, have a drink, and be with friends."}
{"text":"The best thing about ice house is the brown paper that they use instead of plates. 

They also make a delicious lettuce taco."}
{"text":"Just off the main drag is this gem. We had the spiked lemonade and the half chicken bucket. The spiked lemonade is just like what the other reviews say, delicious. The fried chicken bucket came with 5 pieces of fried chicken,  corn bread, coleslaw and potato salad. Everything was amazing. The chicken, although harder than most fried chicken, was  double fried and had a great taste to it. We loved the flavour of the sauce they used over it. My personal preference would be that the batter wasn't as hard and crunchy but it was still so tasty that I wasn't bothered by it. The coleslaw and potato salad were top notch; both very tangy and flavorful. I'm not usually a cornbread liker but even this was good. Not as dry as most I've tried. The vibe was cool, hip, upbeat and different. The service was friendly and helpful. We had a really good time and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was glad a table was available, because the place is small.
Had  the fried chicken, potato salad and coleslaw with a bourbon Lemon aid.

What  I Liked:
Very crispy chicken, I like crispy
Lots of different hot sauces
decent selection of drinks
Our waitress was great, made sure we had everything we needed.

What I didn't:
Drinks were weak, we were asking ourselves whether there was any alcohol actually in  there, I ended up just getting a beer.
Barmaid behind the counter had some attitude I didn't care for, but hey I'm just a customer right.

Would I go back? Maybe, but likely won't be making a special trip to eat there like I did yesterday."}
{"text":"We wandered in here on a Thursday night because we were nearby and my friend had raved about Icehouse.  It's a small restaurant and they don't take reservations. On a Thursday it wasn't a problem but I could see where on weekends you might have a wait.  They also have a great looking terrasse which I can imagine would be fun in summer.  Sadly it was the end of November so we couldn't get to try it.

This is a very casual restaurant.  You don't even eat off plates here.  Prior to serving the waiter places a piece of brown parchment on the table and that is what you eat off of.  Also there are no menus.  The waiter comes and tells you what they are serving that night and what the prices are.

Icehouse specializes in Tex-Mex.  None of us were particularly hungry so we split a serving of fried chicken (5 pieces) with potato salad and coleslaw threeways.  It was fine for us because no one had an appetite but normally I would say split this among two people max.  The chicken was very crispy and sweet too.  It was also fairly moist and juicy.  The potato salad was smoky and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The coleslaw was as good as any.  We had some bourbon lemonade with this and it was pretty strong.

Our meal came out to about $18 before tip which wasn't so bad but as you can see none of us ate very much.  That being said the rest of the prices seemed reasonable for the part of town that we were in."}
{"text":"Great place to watch football.. This is a Gamecock bar. If u plan on watching the game show up early, this place fills up fast. Halftime corn hole is a must. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 3.5 stars I would. As the other reviews says, it does have a great beer selection, lots of TVs to watch the games, and the service was friendly and attentive. The food portion is an issue. We stopped by the other night for a quick bite. Ordered the fried pickles. I'd do that again. They were tasty! After scanning the menu I went with the pimento cheese burger and homemade chips. Now, the flavor was there, just the size was missing. Big bun, small patty, $10. The chips were chips. Next time I'll try the wings."}
{"text":"Tiny little gem just off St-Laurent.
We had their classic mahi-mahi taco and a half bucket of sweet tender finger licking ribs. Nina Simone with other groovy tunes sound track.
Beer on tap. We can't wait to come back for their brisket sandwich.
Friendly service."}
{"text":"This is just your standard sports bar with lots of TV sets to watch multiple football games at once.

Since I have been around the US I have a couple teams I watch on a Sunday. This place will have all the active games up. So someone like me can watch all the games at once without having to bounce from bar to bar and or channel to channel.

As for the food... This place is really nothing special since it is just a sports bar.

Oh yea.. The outside place is dog friendly."}

{"text":"Great tex-mex comfort food!
We took the fried chicken and ribs buckets, it comes with a delicious potato salad, coleslaw and babeurre bread.

The waiter was great and funny, we had a good time!
Be prepared to wait a bit before being seated. The place is crowded."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere.  Really good beer.  Not so good food.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside for lunch.. I got the pulled pork BBQ sandwich (grade: B-) and I tried the chicken parm (grade: C) that my wife ordered.  From looking at the menu they seem to have some good specials almost everyday.  Would I come back and give it another try.. Yes.. Would I strongly suggest to someone visiting the area.. I dont think so.  But... You be the judge if you feel like taking a chance..

{"text":"I'm a Texan living in Montreal this place is so sweet ! I highly recommend the bourbon ice tea I hate sweet cocktails but this one has it down perfectly! For food go all out definitely have the crab stuffed jalapeños to die for, hands down one of the best things on the menu. The bucket of battered chicken with a biscuit a real biscuit is sooo goooood!

Alert: they have $3 burritos $2 drinks on Saturdays - if your on a budget go for it!

The only reason why I cannot give it the full 5 stars is the price ... it's definitely over priced for a Texan girl. 1/2 a bucket of chicken with two apps and one drink each for two will rack you around $80 which is a bit steep for Texan comfort food ;)"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would believe me I ate a quarter of a chicken breast and got charged 6.50 for did not like it at all had to see the worst experience I've ever had and I'm a chef and the quality of work that they put out it wasn't worth the price of the chicken breast sad to say this will be the only time and the last time but they will never get my business oh by the way you do get a free appetizer card though if you don't like your meal maybe I should sell it."}
{"text":"Food was good. What I really didn't appreciate was being touched on my shoulders and moved aside by the owner so that he could shut the door. My friend who loves this place, was caressed on her shoulders as a means of being notified that her food was ready. Sir, we like your food, but please do not touch us."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a casual drink & bite with some friends, a first date, or a night out with your significant other. I ate a combination of a couple tacos and a po'boy sandwich with fried oysters. Everything was delicious. 

If you are in Montreal this is a must visit. I plan to go back soon to taste more from their menu."}
{"text":"It was okay....nothing to write home about. I went on my lunch break and ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich which lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Food wasn't anything to rave over. Service was kinda horrible. I had the spicy tilapia tacos and the went overboard with the sriracha. My girlfriend had the chicken and black bean eggroll, let's just say it should of been called black bean eggroll.  Not sure if I'll be back here. I really had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"First off, the food here is fine. Some of the stuff is pretty good, even. Upon first entering, there is a nice air to the place; well decorated, interesting menu, etc. 
The problem here however is that the place is too aware of the positive. Every item on the menu is overpriced, and the staff have never been particularly attentive to me or my party in the several times that I have visited. 
I used to live in the southwest, and though I was very excited to see a frito pie on the menu, I was sorely disappointed by it. Not even real fritos! Had the consistency of stale deep fried tortilla strips. 
As much as I wanted to like this place, I can't come here anymore, and not just because of its subpar frito pie...just kind of feel like I'm getting ripped off for some not all that great food."}
{"text":"Came here on a summer night. Lovely spot with cute patio. The drinks are great and the atmosphere is fun. Go for their chicken tacos! And their bourbon lemonade was awesome!"}
{"text":"Le poulet frit, ça n'est vraiment pas mon idée d'un bon repas, autant côté goût que santé. Par contre, le poulet frit du Icehouse a complètement changé ma vision de ce met typique du sud des États. J'y suis allée assez tard en soirée, donc on a probablement commandé un peu plus que ce qu'on aurait vraiment pu manger, mais ça en a valu la peine parce qu'on a goûté à plein, plein, plein de bonnes choses. Entre autre, on a mangé les nachos, le poulet frit, les tatter-tots, les jalapenos frits, les tacos au poulet frit et les crab cakes. C'était délicieux à s'en licher les doigts un à la fois comme lorsqu'on est enfant. Et c'est bien comme ça parce qu'on vous sert la bouffe directement sur la table, donc ne pensez pas y aller et devoir être civilisé. Oh non! Pensez plutôt à vous mettre un chandail foncé au cas ou vous feriez des dégâts et mangez avec vos mains. Vous serrez surpris du goût et de la fraîcheur de certains des plats, surtout puisqu'une bonne partie des ingrédients sont frits! Ça paraît que c'est fait \"maison\" et non pas comme dans le fameux PFK qui m'a fait renier le poulet frit pendant plusieurs années. Icehouse, tu as changé ma vision du poulet frit!"}
{"text":"I chose to try out this place through a Groupon special. First impression...nice set up. Modern bar feel (digging the counter height tables); plenty of flat screen Televisions...all tuned in to sports :) There's an upstairs area that looks down upon the scene and also an outdoor sitting area. They had an outdoor space heater and a live band playing outside the night we were there (the lead singer sounded great by the way). We ordered a Spinach Artichoke Dip for starters and it was delicious. Sizzling hot and a little more creamier than other spinach dips that I have had in the past, with chunks of artichoke hearts. I ordered the Bacon Avocado Burger for my entree' and my bf had the pull pork plate (I uploaded some pictures) both were pretty good. The only downside to the entire experience was that our waitress was kinda slow. She bought our drinks and didn't done back for awhile...it was like that through the entire meal actually. All in all I enjoyed myself and will definitely be coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"Icehouse is a great bar with a very strong sports bar look and feel to it. With all of the TV's on for the game, you're going to have a good time tossing back a few brews while the uniformed guys from one city get their butts handed to them by the other uniformed guys from the other city.

I can't really vouch for the food (it looks both expensive and good), but the bar is well stocked and the bartenders are fast, friendly and efficient.

Good times to be had here!"}
{"text":"Delicious mahi mahi tacos, amazingly crispy amd flavorful fried chicken, and refreshing cocktails. I came here with a friend and we decided to split everything since it's the best way to try a bit of everything. Great service! Fried chicken comes with potato salad and cole slaw. Very good!"}
{"text":"Living downtown has a number of perks. One of the big ones on my end is the proximity I have to so many great restaurants. It hits the bank account a bit but when I get a craving for a certain type of food, I am usually close enough to a restaurant that can satisfy my desires. Last Friday, I had a serious hankering of some tex-mex BBQ. Luckily for me, I am a short walk away from one of the best Montreal has to offer. So I called up a buddy who I knew would enjoy the experience, we braved the cold and made our way to Icehouse. 

Icehouse is chef Nick Hodge's second restaurant, he of Kitchenette fame. This small, probably 30 seat space in the Plateau serves up comfort food with a decidedly Texas flare. Tacos, Burritos, fried chicken, ribs. You come here hungry and you most certainly leave here stuffed.

As soon as we walked in the door, we were given a complimentary cup of warmed Dr.Pepper with bourbon. Warm and sweet, the bourbon added a nice kick to it. Given the stiff cold we had to deal with outside, it was a most welcomed surprise. Once that drink was done, we each ordered a glass of the house Bourbon Lemonade. I simply love this drink. The perfect balance of sweetness and sour of the homemade lemonade with the punch of the bourbon. When I've been here in the summer, there is nothing better than ordering a full pitcher and enjoying it on the small terrasse outside. Regardless of the food you order when you visit, the Bourbon Lemonade is an absolutely must.

As an entree, we ordered the queso fundido with chorizo. While I had expected a little more chorizo that we got, it was a very good dish. The consistency was good - thick enough that it stuck to the tortilla chips but not so much that the chips broke when you dipped in. Nice balance of the cheeses - slightly sharpeness but still mild enough. A good start.

For the mains, my buddy ordered the Lobster burrito with pico de gayo, corn and chips. As a side, he ordered some fries. Now I am not a burrito guy. Really not. This one here may have changed that. Absolutely stuffed with lobster, so much so that my buddy was a little surprised, the combo of the lobster with the pico de gayo and the corn had a great balance to it. The fries were perfectly executed as well.

On my end, I ordered the half bucket of HP sauce ribs that comes with coleslaw, smoked potato salad and a buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was flaky and rich. The coleslaw is more of the creamy variety if we were to use the St-Hubert coleslaw scale but still light enough to offset the richness of the potato salad. The Ribs were picture perfect. Just fall off the bone good. The sauce had a nice smokiness and sweeteners that basically made you want to suck up every drop of the sauce that was on the paper towel laid below the ribs. It is so good that once the ribs were done (and believe me, that didn't take very long), we dropped the fries into the sauce and finished them off that way. 
Believe me, if you order the ribs, you need a few towelettes but frankly you won't care.

Icehouse is one of my absolute favorites since I discovered it last year. Note for couples, it is not the place for a quiet sit down meal. Despite its small size, it gets relatively noisy quickly pretty on top of the great music that they play throughout the evening. We walked out of there waddling slightly but very happy about the meal we just had - just like every other time I have visited.If you are looking for a cool, relaxed setting to enjoy a great meal, Icehouse should be high on your list.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm glad there was such a massive line at Schwartz's that I by-passed it and went to this little gem instead. I was seated promptly outside (Saturday, 7:30pm), it was warm out but they also had the patio heaters on, if I came not even 10mins later I would have ended up having to wait for a seat. I went alone, and the servers were very nice and attentive. I didn't know how the ordering process went though, so I made the mistake of getting my seat first then asking for a menu. There is no \"menu\" per se, it's written on the board inside, so you have to read there and then order. Also, it's only in French.  

Ordered the fried chicken tacos and a beer ($17 for both). At first, it looked like there wasn't much chicken in the tacos, just pure lettuce, but underneath was a fair share of chicken. The chicken had a bit of a fishy taste to it, I'm assuming it was in the same batter or same oil as the chicken? Nonetheless, it was pretty good. Crispy outside, juicy inside. I didn't like the fact that there were tons of jalapeno chunks inside the taco though. Perhaps they should serve those on the side, or put less? Also, why don't places ever use corn tortillas?? I think they make tacos taste much better. 

I wasn't super full from my meal, but full enough. Getting a dessert would have been nice, if I was able to read the menu from the outside. Maybe they need to print out their menu for the patio customers. 

Overall, I'm glad I was able to try this place out. I'd eat here again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is great for drinks and nachos.  The BBQ chicken nachos i have had there the past two times have been amazing.  

The overall menu is basic to boring, and the staff seems preoccupied and dull.  But when you are there to hang out for a couple hours and have beers, it isn't a huge issue."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but hey, better late than never! I had heard a lot about Icehouse and that it was a must-try resto in Montreal. I am a fan of Southern comfort food so we ventured here for a friend's birthday in November (the month is relevant, you will see why soon enough). I had heard that it was rather small, and found out they did not in fact take reservations. When we arrived, we saw why; they have a max. seating of 25 people (we were originally 15 people in our party, of which 6 ended up staying to actually eat). We had given our name to the \"hostess\" (mind you, there wait staff takes on the hipster \"I'm too cool for you\" attitude which can be very off-putting) and were told it would be awhile. We ended up ordering drinks on the patio (which had heaters, but it was mid-November and pretty nippy out, so not ideal). We ordered a pitcher of beer, which came out half-head (such a rip off) and ended up costing 23$. After about 30 minutes of waiting outside, our group dwindled down to 6 people. We had debated leaving, at which point I went inside to pay for the pitcher, and was met with a rude \"we're not allowed to only sell alcohol, you have to order food too\" speech from one of the waitresses. I explained to her that we had been waiting for over half an hour and had yet to be seated inside. We eventually decided to stay anyways, and were told that we could eat outside if we wanted to. Although I did not like the idea, we ended up staying. After ordering more drinks outside, a table freed up inside which we quickly grabbed. The tables are by no means capable of holding 5 big guys (and me), but we squished in and made due as we had no alternative. We each placed our order; I had the shrimp po-boy, while others around the table ordered 1/2 bucket ribs + 1/2 bucket fried chicken, full bucket of ribs, etc. Although our orders were, by my standards simple and easy to understand, the wait staff still managed to make a mistake. Instead of 1/2 & 1/2, they brought a full bucket of fried chicken and 2 half buckets of ribs. After explicitly explaining that they made a mistake (as they fought us on the issue saying that that was what we ordered), they brought out another 1/2 bucket of ribs. The food was decent, but not close to being as comforting as authentic southern food. And the wait staff left something to be desired in the customer service area... That being said, I would not recommend this place, nor would I willingly go back."}

{"text":"When I hear Icehouse, what initially comes to mind is that 12 ounce tall can costing a dollar and some change. Cheap, tempting, and while I've had it oh once or twice in my life, I don't know if I'll ever pick up another can. Yep, that's kinda what Icehouse is. It has so much potential, but lacks proper execution.

The bottled beer list is quite impressive, but the food isn't anything special and the draft beer selection is even less impressive. 

For food we had the sports bar staples; wings, which were um, for lack of a better word, gross and chicken strips. Strips with the batter falling off like it was rolling down a slip 'n slide. Other food items I can't comment on, but a friend stated the veggie burger wasn't very good either (he should have read Faith's review before ordering!). 

On a positive note though, the decor is pretty nice. A modern take on the typical sports bar. The kitchen is open and at a glance, Icehouse can almost, almost qualify as a high end restaurant. If only the food were better."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in lower plateau or probably the best. 

Tasty, greasy food with good sauces. This is a place to be in a sunny afternoon and enjoy it with your friends. Great vibe inside. I haven't tried a lot of tex-mex places but this one definitely has thermosphere.

+ great tacos / vibe

- we were 3 and ordered chicken plus some fish tacos. The place was crowded ok, but we waited at least 40 mins or so. If you are very hungry this is not your place. Go to Main, across Schwartz's.

- dry chicken. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"I really can't understand how this place still manages to get good reviews, it makes me wonder if people just feel the need to give a place praises because that's what everyone else has been saying.
I had like everyone else, heard great things about Icehouse and was told it was a must try. My sister on the other hand warned me that it really wasn't worth trying, she was right.
The service was horrible!! The concept of not having a menu for every table and only having it on the wall really fails to work when your location is L shaped and half the restaurant has to get up and awkwardly stand beside other tables as they eat and chat while you in a rushed fashion try and decide what you'd like to eat.
I was willing to put the crappy service, crappy menu placement and lame, nasty, gimmicky serving aside (they basically dump the food on the table) as long as I was about to eat some great food, that didn't happen either. 
We were a large enough group with big enough bellies that we were able to sample almost all that the menu had to offer and didn't find a single item worth going back for not to mention that their fried chicken has to be one of the nastiest things I've ever tasted.
You won't be seeing me at icehouse anytime soon and I know that I speak for everyone that was with me in saying...not deserving of the hype"}
{"text":"My first review after returning to the States.  Not much for foodies here.  Typical Sysco menu.  Very good craft beer list though.  Disinterested server.

This is a good place for casual gatherings, quaffing some cold ones with only moderate expectations from the kitchen.  Hey, it's a \"bar and grill\"."}
{"text":"First and foremost, come here for the eats.  When one walks in to this fine little hidden gem amongst the rough of lower Plateau they are immediately confronted with a comfortable and relaxed décor, some punk music jamming on the stereo (as was the case tonight), and plenty of happy patrons enjoying delicious grub.

I tried all of the different tacos (chicken, ribs, porc, portobello, \"red-fish\") and was happily surprised at all the results.  Everything was delicious and the waiter brought out some home-made tabasco and habanero sauces which were very much appreciated.

As far as the drinks go...not my cup of tequila.  Don't get me wrong, the bar offers great options as far as unadulterated beverages (tequila, gentlemen jack, etc.) but the Micalada (not too certain on that pronoun nor its spelling) which is essentially a caesar with beer in lieu of vodka and mexican soy sauce and worcestershire in lieu of clamato (not really like a caesar...) was an underwhelming and underboozy beverage for my taste.  I attempted to order a pitcher of margarita (hey, I'm from California) and was informed that it would a) cost $50 and b) be worth it.  Overall, a) it did but b) it definitely was not.  I don't know about you other yelpers, but when I drink a margarita i expect to taste tequila.  If I wanted to drink candy, I could go drink at any crappy bar on the lower main.  If I wanted to pay an insane amount of money for said candy beverage, I could ask some idiot first-year from McGill where Candy Bar is.

In any case, I can get a nice little drink at Else's down the street, and head over to Icehouse for a delicious little snack.  After yoga at Moksha, of course."}
{"text":"The food is ok in general, HOWEVER,
extremely pricey.

Don't get the \"guedille au homard\" for $25; I kid you not, it is the cheapest hot dog bug you can find filled with an overcooked lobster(consistency of octopus) and mayonnaise. It comes with absolutely nothing and is a complete ripoff.

The soda was flat as well.

Portions are extremely small, this should not try to call itself a tex-mex restaurants if it has such small portions."}
{"text":"We aren't sports bar people, but we really enjoyed this place. Crazy good spicy tuna thingy I had. My 19-yr old son ordered some kind of gi-normous burger that had an egg on it and it was so impressive that a patron walking by had to stop and comment on it. I didn't think too much about their wings...I prefer Wing King in Fort Mill...but they were passable. We stopped in one day, starving, and found the entire place focused on the Carolina-Clemson game. Great atmosphere and we had a fun time, even though we are actually MN Gopher fans!"}
{"text":"Super cute place, with a tiny cozy terrasse. We had their famous chicken on a bucket, it's delicious! Perfectly cooked, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Perfect for a casual date. 

The chicken that comes in a bucket is basically put over the table with a paper tower under it. It's a nice little authentic move :) It came with a side of potato salad and a cabbage salad. It was around 20$ and definitely shareable if you're not hungry."}
