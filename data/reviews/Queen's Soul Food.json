{"text":"The food was great many selection of soul food selection to choose from it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service. Tilapia was hot and fresh. Collard greens and mashed potatoes were delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and look hard for vegetables with seasoning. Being in the south if you can go to big mama's house, that's always #1. But Queen soulfood is a good 2nd place. Nice and friendly service and very clean establishment. 

I had mac and cheese, pinto beans and cole slaw. Everything was great!  I'll definitely be back!  Good luck surviving beside one of the oldest restaurants in Charlotte...People had change in the south."}
{"text":"I ate here one time on a whim because my husband said he used to eat there when he was a kid. It was very good food for good prices. The atmosphere and cafeteria style is pretty outdated."}
{"text":"Ain't no way in the world I am going back.  My wife and I went for the first time and we both got baked chicken.  She got cabbage and I got greens.  The chicken was very dry and had very little flavor and the veggies had very little taste as well. The staff was so very friendly, which just so happened to be the best part of the whole experience.  Too bad you cant convert friendliness into great food.  So disappointed.  I wanted a place near home that could be my go-to spot.  I guess I have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Ox tails were seasoned good with a dark gravy broth, however they were not tender and pricey."}
{"text":"OK I don't get why this place is getting such a bad rap. I stopped in last night and the server was super friendly and eagerly told us what all they offered since it was our first visit. I had a large plate: meatloaf, tangy soft and delicious. The jerk chicken was my favorite with just the right amount of kick, and so tender it was falling off the bone. The yams were sweet and soft, macaroni and cheese was cheezy, buttery bliss, and rice with brown gravy. Oh and their corn muffins?! I could eat a plate of them. Seriously. The food wasn't overly spiced, which if you bring your kids, is a great thing, but it still had plenty of flavor and was cooked to perfection. He owner was so friendly, he came out to ask us about our meal and apparently remembers my hubby from 10 years ago when he came in while it was still an Asian buffet. I'm from GA born and raised, and for those of us that love good home cooking and can't find the time to make it, this is the perfect place. I plan on stopping by today. I had leftovers for breakfast... Yes it's that good. Next time though I will go with a small plate, because the large was enough for two meals."}
{"text":"I came here hoping for some great soul food; mediocre at best. WRONG! It was terrible. I went with the smothered pork chops because all other options looked...sad. I also got the collards and mac and cheese. The collards were \"eh\" and the Mac and cheese was \"bleh\". My boyfriend got the fried chicken and complained that it may have been sitting in water at some point. Amazing service and friendly people but I was not impressed with the meal. The only thing that made the trip worthwhile was the cake. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! I will be back for the cake...maybe."}
{"text":"Best Mac n Cheese in Charlotte hands down!! Costumer service good, n they dont skimp on the portions.

Dont leave tips for the servers as they do not receive them. Was informed that's management requires them to turn in any tips made at the end of the day into the register to be added to the store's sales for the day :/"}
{"text":"I just started a new job a few miles away from this place, so I decided to stop by on my way home from work. I guess there was reason why I had forgotten my credit card at work, God was warning me not to stop at this place. I had great expectations going in because it was so many people going inside & coming out with numerous amounts of to go plates, but looks can definitely be deceiving. I love, love, love soul food, but this is not soul food. I ordered the bourbon chicken, mac & cheese & collards. Everything was so bland & disappointing. I wanted to like it so bad, but couldn't eat it after 3 bites. The cornbread & sweet tea was very delicious, I was so excited to taste everything, but the disappointment infuriated me. I couldn't believe I wasted $9 on subpar food. Nonetheless the customer service was fantastic. They're all very nice & friendly, but the owners could definitely invest in a new recipe. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I was was in Charlotte for the night, and wanted some soul food and someone recommended Queens.   I ordered the bourbon chicken, the curry chicken, macaroni and cheese, and collard greens.   As I sat down and started eating, I realized I had made a terrible mistake.   I don't know if it's because it was so late and the food was just sitting there all day, but the food had no flavor   it took me back to one of my childhood rap songs by Sugarhill Gang, \" the macaroni soggy the peas are smushed and the chicken taste like wood.  And baby Bubba I did not recommend this place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer Service was great, can't complain about that everybody was so friendly and the location was good.  BUT the food was -it was just awful I hate to say it.  No flavor if they could just try and put a little love or something to their food this place wouldn't be so bad.  Do yourself a favor train your current cook or hire someone to help him."}
{"text":"First time being in here and was very very impressed! Great selection of food to choose from and everything was made fresh today. I had the meat loaf yams and green beans and it was wonderful!!! Will definitely be back here again for lunch! The staff were helpful and funny just like family!"}
{"text":"Customer service was really good- owner is comedic. Too bad the joke's on us with the flavorless food. The collard greens had too much vinegar, a dash sugar could balance things out. The yams were strange and syrupy and the macaroni with cheese appeared cheesy, yet tasted too greasy with butter. Corn muffin was soft and sweet and the bourbon chicken was tasty. Drinks come with meal and the meals range from $9-$11 depending on two/three meats/sides combinations.Also, one stalled restrooms with no changing table.  Doubtful to return even if someone else was buying..."}
{"text":"I waited until my third time to review. The food is pretty good..chicken is ok, greens are heavy on the vinegar, potato salad is ok, but the mac & cheese is pretty lackluster, which kinda hurt my feelings. There is one lady who gives significantly larger portions than the rest, everyone is typically nice. In short, it'll do- but it ain't Grandma's."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. I usually get my order to go but I think they give you the best portions for your money of any soul food restaurant in the city. The soul food spots I've been to are (Floyds, Nana's, Mert's and Lola's). Queen is by far the best if you ask me. Friendly customer service and great food, nice prices. What else could u ask for and I think they have the best variety of food on a daily basis."}
{"text":"The place is raggedy. The food is not fresh tasting. The host is okay butto  talkative. I had bourbon chicken and it tasted like they just poured bourbon in it and heated it up. I'm sorry, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, it was very good... just like authentic \"soul food\". The owner/manager is friendly and funny, and he'll tell you stories and try to remember you when you return, which helps to make you feel welcomed.  Although this is my first time writing a review on this restaurant after visiting several times, I was a little disappointed recently when I stopped on my way home from work.  It appears that if you come too late (or right before they close), you'll likely get what's left over unless you order a meat that has to be prepared upon request, like a kind of fish.  I guess it's a hit or miss, depending on when you go and what you prefer.  However, there are plenty selections and I can't seem to find a better soul food spot in the area that competes with this one?"}
{"text":"After 4 years, Queen's Soul Food never disappoints!
Mr. Tony is the best host! 
My food was fresh and well seasoned as always!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Home cooking big portions and friendly owner. My favorite are the yams, collards, Lima beans, fried chicken, smothered pork chop, potatoes salad.... I haven't had anything that wasn't good. Every time I've been in there there is a line to get food and the place is always full of police officers, firemen etc.  that to me is always a good sign.  It is not a fancy restaurant but the food is good and consistent."}
{"text":"Visited Queen's after chuch Sunday since I was in the area.  It's cafeteria style meat and 2 or 3 sides.  I was a little disappointed with the food here........I ordered the smothered chops, cabbage, and potatoes...my son had the ribs, mac n cheese, cabbage, and a side of catfish.  The majority of the food had very little seasoning but especially the cabbage......the mac n cheese, potatoes, and the catfish had very little taste so needless to say I won't be returning to Queen's in the future."}
{"text":"This is a seriously overlooked gym in The Queen City. We came here after reading about it in the Charlotte Agenda. This place should be packed wall to wall with a line out of the door. There is $7 lunch special that's 1 meat, 2 sides, cornbread or a roll (get the cornbread!!!) and a drink. I think it's regularly $9. The food is fresh and flavorful. The yams are perfect. No, for real, perfect. The banana pudding and apple cobbler are bomb, too."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, because of uncertain reviews we almost missed this!  It's more of a laid back inner city atmosphere.  The food was good, the greens.... man, I'd go back just for those!  And the customer service can't be beat.  Not sure if he was the owner, an Asian gentlemen, but my God that man, even if the food wasn't good made us feel so welcomed!  Such a difference, made sure to check on us, thanked us when we left, and they were busy!  I had baked chicken with gravy, mac & cheese and my greens.  My husband had the fried catfish and BBQ chicken, yams and black eyed peas.  I'm getting my own fish next time!  Food was great!"}
{"text":"After hanging out in Charlotte for Christmas shopping. We needed a place to take the load off and rest ourselves. We noticed a family favorite restaurant that serve ala carte but we saw this restaurant off in the corner. Deciding to risk it all, we tried this restaurant.Best Choice. Great layout, spouse had the baked chicken and I had the bourbon chicken.  Excellent flavor. Fresh vegetables and sides. We approve of this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time eating here was years ago. I was just visiting at the time now I decided to recently go try it again and I love it! Beat soul food in Charlotte I had yet far. Details details details! This isn't some rushed food that some through together in one day. If they do they do a damn good job at it because it taste like it was made overnight with LOTS AND LOTS OF TLC! Every bite is finger licking good. At 1st being from the north I thought K&W was soul food until I tried this. It was love at first sight I even went back the next day! Keep up the awesome work with this hard working dedicated team!"}
{"text":"I went this week. Ordered the  fried chicken special. The chicken is not seasoned. The potatoes were very salty. On the way out, i saw the sanitation grade. 81! Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting and the food was delicious. Mr. Tony came out and greeted his customers he was very personable. I would definitely go back to enjoy his conversation and good food"}
{"text":"Here is the breakdown of my first visit to this place . First it's not authentic Soul  Food. Second the owners are friendly and comical they will make you feel welcomed. Third The food is decent but not great so don't expect miracles. Fourth don't leave tips urban legend has it that it goes to the owners not the restaurant workers. Fifth while the customer service is friendly the food is not something you can't find anywhere else. I would not recommend going out of your way to try this place."}
{"text":"The food was great, and the owner was really entertaining. The service was great and very friendly. No lie I didn't expect much when I got there. Byt definitely a good find, and definitely succeeded my expectations. If you go, definitely get the smothered porkchop, fried okra, and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style, no fuss. Good foooood though. Like good. We went on a Sunday at noon and it was packed.

I got a small plate of the fried chicken, mac and cheese and cabbage. It was more than enough to fill me up. Would totally go back."}
{"text":"It was ok. The food is pretty good. Not as good as some places. The service was ok, seem like everyone had an attitude and didn't wanna be there."}
{"text":"Hands down the best soul food I've ever had that wasn't cooked in someone's house. I was sure that it was owned by a local family but come to find out it was owned by a gentleman who used to be good friends with Queen Latifah's grandmother.. hence the name Queen.. I'll put it to you this way. This place was so amazing I went back for seconds the day I was leaving town to fly back to KY. They had the best fried chicken and their side fixins were top notch. I personally couldn't get away from the black eyed peas and macaroni and cheese but they had everything from collard greens to fried okra to mashed potatoes. They had it all. The cornbread was perfection as well. The people that work there were absolutely delightful both days I went. They play 70s/80s funk and Motown hits and for those of you that know me... those are my jams and what I grew up with quite a bit. Great experience all the way around."}
{"text":"My top 5 favorite soul food places in the country.  The food is great and the option of meals unlike any other place I've visited.  It is cafeteria style i.e. you have to bus a tray around, but the food is delicious.  The place is not a high end restaurant with waiters, elegant decore, and soft music.  However, what they lack in asthetics they more than compensate in the deliciousness of their food.  If good food is your focus this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast, courteous staff and owner!!! We got here at the last minute and they welcomed us in. Food had not been laying around and was top notch!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I had the bourbon chicken, Mac n cheese, with greens! YUM. The owner was super sweet and made sure once your got through the buffet style selection you paid and were on your way!"}
{"text":"Great Southern cooking with very friendly service. Had Sunday lunch, the freshly fried catfish was excellent. Good mac'n cheese, alright collards. Yams were savory and sweet. Fried chicken was nice and crispy, the dark meat was better, the white meat was a little on the tough side. Good home style soul food at very good prices."}
{"text":"If I don't have a chance to cook dinner Bc of my schedule, I always go to Queens Soul Food!  Great owner, great customer service, and really good food!"}
{"text":"Great Food!  Food is not over seasoned with great flavor.  Genuine cooking recipes.  If you want more info on this place read the reviews on google 300+ at 4.6 stars.  

The best thing about this place is not the food but the inspirational story of the owner.  I would suggest having a chat while eating in and learn about the life of this person growing up.  It will definitely put you in a state of mind to be grateful of your life and pursue your dream.  Absolutely and exceptional person.  

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Was here in town with a large group, we were all talking about getting some soul food. I scouted out Queens and decided even though the reviews say I shouldn't.   We ended up ordering a three Veg plate, which included mac & cheese, greens and yams. The food was overall a five out of 10. The mac & cheese was so so , The greens had too much vinegar  and the yams were so so too. 

What really bothered me was I paid seven dollars for Soso food and small portions with no meat.  The container was small size not your regular size to go container.   Only one small cornbread muffin instead of two.  The portions were dished from a small scoop, and practically leveled off.

In summary trust the yelp reviews, I cannot recommend this to the rest of my group.   I hope Queen reads their reviews and make some changes because I want to see black businesses succeed."}
{"text":"I am very unsure why there are recently low reviews. I found this spot about 3 or so months ago and have visited about 3 times. The food is awesome. This is the best soul food restaurant that I have been to in Charlotte. Bland? Not at all. The food is seasoned very well, as soul food should be. Maybe it depends on the day that you go. But each time I have been it was absolutely great. The staff is awesome and the owner is accommodating. Queen's is GOOD!"}
{"text":"Value does not meet quality. This restaurant was recommended to me as a great soul food place. Sorry, many other places in CLT far outrank this one. Limited options of sides which were \"okay.\"  I ordered the small plate white meat chicken- the avg tasting breast & a rubbery piece of cornbread is all you get for a whopping $10. I'll make my drive to South CLT LaWan's, Nanas & even House of Prayer before returning here. They do have unsweet tea which is sometimes hard to get."}
{"text":"It's crazy how much food you get for the price! I love how I can tell the greens aren't canned and the mac n cheese isn't the cheap, tasteless, runny kind you'll find at a Chinese buffet. The customer service is great and they're always welcoming."}
{"text":"The food was very good and I was so pleased until I found a long hair in Greens.  I had to discover it in my mouth.  Eat the greens with caution.  Not okay at all."}
{"text":"So.... I went to this place on a Saturday evening.  I love soul food and I am always willing to try new places.  However, I was so disappointed with this place.  The place looks run down in the inside.  But I didn't want judge based upon the inside because some of the best food are in a hole in the wall.  So I ended up taking a 2 wing plate to go.... and I got Mac and cheese, and collard greens as my side. Once I got home...I was excited to try the food.  And I was so disappointed.  The mac and cheese was so nasty that I almost vomited while tasting it.  The collard greens was okay. And the chicken lacked any type of seasoning.  Needless to say.... I ended up having to get food from somewhere else.   This meal was a waste of my money.  And I will never be back here. Just gross!"}
{"text":"Recently visited with my family. We had the Flounder, chicken and ox tails. All were very good. The sides were great. Collard greens are perfectly seasoned. I will be back. Anthony the owner has a great personality."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for only two nights, and LOVED Queens so much we had to go twice.  The fried fish was perfect - crispy, flakey, and not at all greasy.  AMAZING  curried chicken.  Fantastic greens, and Mac and cheese.  I only wish I could have tried every single thing!!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot if you want to just chill out and talk. Not eat, if you want soul food that's has no soul. Creamy Mac n Cheese, come on now! My husband is from Dominica says the jerk chicken is a flop. I'm not a chef but I know soul food and there's a spot on South Tryon that gets the job done. So everyone has a bad day in the kitchen so maybe another day. But for today it is what it is."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the lunch small plate with collard greens and yams. Oh my! The catfish was cooked to order. My entire family loved their selections. Overall, we had the meatloaf, fried chicken, and catfish. The peach cobbler is ok. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped in during lunch and was very surprised. It's always the places of the beaten path that has great food. Queen's had exactly what I was looking for. Great food! Only bad thing is that I didn't come sooner! I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is okay, nothing spectacular. The food was warm, not hot because it's sort of on a buffet line type thing. I got a large plate (2 meats, 3 sides, cornbread/roll, and drink for $12.99) with fried chicken, bourbon chicken, macaroni & cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes with gravy. The collard greens were sweet which was different to me. The atmosphere could have been better. One employee walked through the dining room talking on her phone extremely loudly while we were eating. The banana pudding was just like any other banana pudding, not home made and mediocre. The sweet tea was pretty good. Don't think my family will be back."}
{"text":"High recommend this place is you in this area , clean great food and fair price . I will back soon for more"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst food I've ever had. I really wanted to like this and I hope maybe I just went on one of their off days. The mac and cheese LOOKED good. The taste was the exact opposite. It literally tasted like they put water in it. There was cheese, but you couldn't taste the cheese. The noodles were overcooked. It was ridiculous. The fried okra was not seasoned, at all. The corn muffin looked gross, didn't even try it. I fed it to the ducks at freedom park. The tilapia was half decent, again, it wasn't seasoned though! Very bland. The mashed potatoes and gravy weren't only thing I finished. They were honestly the only thing half way edible. I'm from the north and was really looking forward to southern soul food. Disappointed. The ladies were nice though."}
{"text":"The owner takes ALL of the tips, the employees NEVER see those tips! Restaurant has a bad roach problem I witnessed bugs in food after working with the food. Cooks do not use gloves when preparing your food! They also use food from the day before and tell you it's all fresh. I've witnessed so much working here it has completely deterred me as a customer and quit eating the food as I witnessed the way they handle the food. If you like making minimum wage and don't get your tips and no discount on meals oh not to mention the slave driver who will cuss and completely disrespect you while your working and not to mention no breaks and no weekends off then this is the place for you. This place is a complete hole on the wall with no value of its employees. Labor board was called because he didn't pay overtime. Employees are overworked and under appreciated."}
{"text":"I visited about two weeks ago.  Food was good and manager was very visible and personable, apologizing for no AC.  They had plenty of fans so was pretty comfortable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here! Fried chicken dark, Mac n cheese, candied yams and roll were all HOT and delicious. Good value with the lunch special. Service was slightly slow but very friendly and courteous!!  Heard server ask customer behind if he never wanted bread or just today, as if she would remember for him next time. Server and manager came through the dining area to welcome customers and recognized new faces and actually held a conversation beyond the typical \"manager check\". The atmosphere is what you would expect from a small strip mall restaurant.  I think the quality and value of the food paired with the friendly welcome more than makes up for it! I will be back and bring work friends."}
