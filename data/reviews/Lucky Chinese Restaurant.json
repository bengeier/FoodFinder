{"text":"Restaurant was busy for a weeknight and we figured that was a good sign. Checked Yelp and it appeared positive.   Had the Manchurian noodle with shrimp, chicken pakoras and chilli chicken. Service was quick. Pakoras came out first... At least that's what we ordered. Not sure if I would call what the hard, round tennis balls, brown, almost black, mostly breading things, pakoras... But okay. Taste? Just like I expected. Not good. I thought maybe the just burned out batch. Nope. That's how they all looked when I looked around the room for other patrons who ordered \"pakoras\".   Manchurian noodles were drenched in oil. A lot of oil. Slippery couldn't hold them on chopsticks oily. The dish as mostly noodles - no veggies and shrimp were tiny. Chilli chicken was also a greasy mess.  The only thing that they didn't mess up was the rice. Oh and the Coke that I ordered.   The only \"positive\" thing was that portions were huge. Enough for us to take home for lunch and dinner the next day. Not that we wanted to eat it again."}
{"text":"I am totally hooked to this place. Food is great, they give plenty for take out. Price is also reasonable, you get some discount if you pay by cash. They also have lunch special that comes with soup or roll.   This is a bit too crowded on weekends, I prefer going a little late in the evening for take out."}
{"text":"Speaking from the point of view of a Chinese person, this restaurant has the most authentic Chinese food in the area. As a family run restaurant, the owner, Cindy, makes anyone feel a part of the family. Of course the food is stupendous. If you like spicy food, then this is your \"Lucky\" day. Dive into a bowl of Dan Dan Noodles, fire up your mouth with Kung Pao Chicken, and/or enter bliss with the only freshly fried General Tso Chicken you'd find anywhere. After trying the food once, you'll be coming back every week (like I do)."}
{"text":"No other Hakka restaurant in the GTA satisfies me as much as Lucky's does. Although it's quite an effort of a drive coming from Markham, it always does justice. Ordered the chicken manchurian noodles and there was explosions in my mouth from the spice, the flavour, and all the meat in my mouth. They don't cheap out on the meat at all compared to other places. I'll definitely be back another time for lunch to chow on that chilli chicken people have been raving about."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout Chicken Wings and Chicken Pakora.  Chicken Pakora was pretty good,  a little on the hot side for me but as far as Pakoras goes worth eating for sure.  When I ordered the Chicken Wings there was nothing on the menu that indicated if it was spicy/garlic/hot etc. But I when I tasted them they were absolutely bland and I mean completely bland, there's more spicyness in KFC wings. I was quite surprised, I was expecting a basic level of tastiness and it was literally wings fried in a batter, salt and pepper and that's it.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to parties held at Lucky's and the food was never good. Frederick's is way better! Like a million times better! What a total waste of money of a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"So...  I actually discovered this gem through several friends, all of whom were looking for an authentic chinese restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  It is important to note that this place is slightly out of the way (wexford is a good 20-30 min drive depending on traffic), and  serves American Chinese food and authentic Szechuan food.  My parents come from out of town not to see me, but for this food (particularly the green beans).  :)  Okay, maybe a bit of both.  If you want real Szechuan food, ask for the real, Chinese menu.  Otherwise all you will get is the american chinese menu (if you are not Chinese).  It's a short menu, but full of some good stuff.  Get the noodles (under appetizers), phonetically pronounced Dan-dan (as in \"Hahn\") mein, the green beans, and the fish.  Yum!  But pretty much all is good.  And make sure to ask for it spicey if you really want it spicey!    Definitely worth the drive..."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious restaurant.  Chili chicken is AMAZING, as well other dishes are pretty decent but a some like the fried rice is a little on the oily side. Would definitely rec com end this place."}
{"text":"Very bad service and the worst food ever. Very old stale food is microwave heated and served to innocent customers who have to pay enormous prices for small portions of rotten food.  The manager and staff are very rude.  When we complained about the food they asked us to pay and leave and they said they are closed now at 1030 pm when their website says 11 pm.  Buyer beware and dont go to this filthy restaurant"}
{"text":"Hands down to the taste; value; portion. Best chili chicken!!! Not your best dining area but place is clean. Busy place; a lot of take out too. Call ahead for take out as they have long lines during peak hours."}
{"text":"Very good value for take out!!   We tried this place on a whim and with a craving for some Haka.  We ordered some classic dishes - cantonese chow mein, crispy beef, pakoras and spicey veggie fried rice.  All for $34... amazing price, and amazing food, too!   Portions were very generous, enough to feed 4-6 people easily.    We ordered over the phone and picked up at a busy dinner time.  The restaurant itself was filled (which is a good sign!) and the food was ready in 15 minutes.  The restaurant really would needs a website and online menu.   Otherwise, we'll be back and this may just be our new go-to Haka takeout in the Scarborough.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I work really close to this place so my colleagues and I order take out from here at least once a week. Their lunch specials are huge portions that can be split among 2-3 people WITH leftovers for the next day.  All lunch specials come with a spring roll or soup.My favourite is the chicken corn. Plenty enough food for lunch. The chili chicken is among the best in the city.  Their hakka chowmein albeit a little greasy at times, is tasty. Some other great items also include szechaun vegetables and black bean beef with vegetables. On most days,  you can find a few neighbourhood police officers stopping in for lunch which is a good sign as they tend to know all the good places to eat. If you decide to dine in,  you will be entertained with the multiple t.v.'s playing Bollywood movies. Stop in if you're in the area.  It's a good bet if you're craving Hakka."}
{"text":"The chicken pakoras are highly addictive. Best chili chicken and hot and sour soup I have had in the city hands down. Will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"The owner has reached out and said he has addressed the video issue to ensure family friendly videos are playing.   I haven't been back to confirm this but I plan to visit again.   I do appreciate  the owner reaching out."}
{"text":"Best hakka restaurant in Scarborough, delicious food for cheap and huge quantity of food! Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"Best spot for hakka! Have searched the entire GTA for a better spot for chili chicken and can't find one. Have been going to Lucky's for years and I highly recommend it!!! Super cheap, food is prepared fast and full of flavour!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chilli chicken in Scarborough. Tried Frederick, Lin Garden, Kinkin and Spicy Dragon and i still prefer Lucky's. Service is fast and lots of people lining up for take outs. Every time we dine in there, you can see police officers getting their take out food. This is our Go To take food when we have potluck at work. You can always request less sauce, less salt, less spice or less oil. We usually order chilli chicken, sweet and sour fish and fried chicken wings and Hakka chowmein. Pakoras good too. But their Chilli chicken is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant that has unfortunately closed."}
{"text":"Best hakka chinese restaurant! Order the sweet and sour chicken or chilli chicken they on point!"}
{"text":"The portion of the food was good for the cost. Food tastes alright like typical Chinese restaurants (chili chicken, black bean beef, curry fried rice?). There was some kind of hard shell texture in the fried rice, it could have been egg shells but I'm not too sure.. didn't want to risk it and threw it away."}
{"text":"Ordered from here 2 days ago and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! The curry chicken was delicious and had a great kick, the chicken pakora was not too greasy, had a great crunch and was spicy. The Singapore noodles were very good and also not greasy. Only downside I would say is their chilli chicken was just okay and not nearly as spicy as I would have liked."}
{"text":"I have snuck in here forever.  And will always come to this place so long as I can drive to it.  There is a way of sort of ethnic dining in Toronto, where you get to really try good food from different cultures.  I would recommend this place for a dip in.  A way you can tell if an ethnic local Toronto place has good food, is who actually goes to eat there.   I.e.  You go to a Chinese restaurant, you want to see people from that Culture eating there.  Inside this place, you get all kinds of ethnicities coming in here, and really enjoying their food.  Yes, if you are not used to a bunch of ethnic people from all races coming in to eat, you might not find this place that comfortable.  Whole families will come.  So will a date.  So will someone for takeout.  So will someone out of a barber shop.  It is asian people serving you, with Bollywood songs on a big screen in the background.  Super crowded place.  You sit down, you get your menu.  Service is chaotic, but for the charm and business of the place, you eventually get fed a heavy portion.  Best, Chilli Chicken,  Chilli Chicken, Chilli Chicken.  Remember I warned you about the frenetic environment.  Scarborough's New Frederick's.  As Frederick's has Fell Off!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this hakka-Chinese restaurant.   If it's your first time, ask for mild spice. The manchurian chicken and chili chicken is a must try when you visit! Portions are huge and the staff is great! Go to the Midland/Lawrence Ave E location"}
{"text":"If I am ever in Toronto and want some Chinese, this is my go to spot.  I have been here quite a few times.  Legit Chinese for those that want Zabiha.  Flavorful, and fresh.  I have heard from others that the quality has declined since the last time I have been here, but I cannot vouch for that until I experience it myself."}
{"text":"I've been trying a lot of Hakka food in the GTA, with so many disappointment, this is still my favorite Hakka Chinese Restaurant. Best flavor, portion and price. To be honest, the taste did change a little after they opened the second restaurant, I believe the chef who used to cook here went to the new location but it's still good overall. My must order dishes are Chicken Pakora, Singapore Rice Noodle, Garlic Chicken, Hot and Sour Soup, Manchurian Chow Mein...It's not a big restaurant, so if you plan to dine in with a big party, go early or I would suggest you to go to the other location, it's bigger over there. And they are always busy, so even for take out, make sure you give them at least half an hour to be ready."}
{"text":"Disgusting Customer Service. My mom collapsed and fainted in the store due to the Flu. While trying to help her regain consciousness, I asked the staff to please call 911. Instead of calling 911 a lady who works there told me \"Why dont you call 911, you have cell phone\" (my cell phone was on the table where we were eating). It took another customer who was dining-in to convince them to call 911. I was absolutely shocked. Foods great, but they really need to work on their customer service and how to treat customers with respect."}
{"text":"Have been going there for past 10 years and loved this place but last 3 times in past 4 months was very disappointing. Ordered chilli chicken -all 3 times was dry. On one occasion ordered shrimp fried rice - maybe 4 shrimps in the whole plate.  I need to find another good Hakka place. :("}
{"text":"Waaaaaaaay tooo long to wait for take out.  Over 45 minute wait for 2 dishes when I was told 15.  Oh well Fredericks around the corner next time."}
{"text":"Their beef and brocoli and chicken hot sour soup are good, better than other chinese restaurants. Their fried squid are over cooked and they used too much bater on it to the point that it tasted like starch and dry. Still food and ambience is ok for casual dining"}
{"text":"This is my first time having Indian Hakka fusion food and I must say, I am a fan. The chili chicken won me over. There's something wonderful about chicken.. Crispy.. Fried... And tossed in a sweet and sour sauce.   What to order: Chili chicken  Veggie pakora (kindof spicy) Singapore rice noodle Crispy Shrimp with a yummy dipping sauce  On another note, the place is clean, has several TVs playing Bollywood music and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"My family loves Hakka food and this is one of the great ones!  Try the special spicy chicken you will not be disappointed.  Their crispy beef is amazing as well.  This use to be the go to for me for Hakka but found somewhere that is walking distance from me.  But I will be back to lucky's for sure!"}
{"text":"All these reviews that praise this place that I will never step foot in again. Customer service is 0.  Have walked in twice and both times was wanting take out and both times totally ignored. No hello welcome Can I help you kiss my ass nothing. That's exactly what I left with..nothing. This excuse for a restuarant could be the last  standing Chinese  food place in the city and I would not give them a dime. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a coworker, who brought me in for lunch.  Love the ambiance; Bollywood videos playing on the TVs, very clean.  The food was great.  We had chili chicken, Manchurian beef noodles, and spring rolls.  The chili chicken was amazing.  As hot as it could be and still be edible.  I had sweat dripping down my nose!  The beef noodle dish was quite good as well.  The spring rolls were OK, nothing unusual.  They did come with a great pickled salad, which was delicious.  The food is great, the service is prompt and friendly, and the price is good.  Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Best Hakka by Far! Even above Frederick's, Faley's, China Palace and China Cottage (all of which are great)!  If Luck is reading this - please open in Downtown Toronto - may I suggest Liberty Village :)  @Sol R - Hakka is fusion of Chinese and Indian cuisine, and many of their guests are South Asian - so that's the reason for the Bollywood music (and I guess the videos).  That said, I agree that the TV is unnecessary   Back to the food - I love the Special Spicy Chicken, Manchurian Noodles and for sure the Chicken Corn Soup. Just be sure to ask for \"less oil\" - not that its healthy that way... just less \"bad\" ;)  Hope this helps :)"}
{"text":"This place had been on my list for a while and I finally got to go last night.  I was told the Dan Dan Noodles appetizer and Adrian's shrimp were the way to go and needless to say, I was not led astray.  We had a number of dishes between the 7 of us and everything was very tasty.  Definitely worth a shot if you are from the area."}
{"text":"Delicious spicy Hakka food. Been a few times with large groups and they do get busy on holidays so expect to wait.   This place has been around for sometime and I still enjoy going back for old time sake.  Not sure why other reviewers think the food is pre-made, it's not a buffet here. Clearly some people are unaware of how quick a commercial wok can stir fry.   As with most Chinese places, the takeouts are your best bet if you don't have time to dine in. However they do like to really pack those boxes. They always throw in the hot sauces but ask for fork and spoon."}
{"text":"Excellent cozy place to eat in or take out. Food is amazing and staff are super friendly. I felt warm and welcomed, we weren't pressured for time or tips unlike some of the other places I've come across. The portion sizes are HUGE for the price!!! One container lasts me for 3 meals which is great! Would definitely recommend this place! Just watch out for cars in the parking lot as it tends to be hectic there."}
{"text":"I've been going to Luckies for about 15 years now and I must say its one of my top 3 picks for Hakka food. They have two locations both alongside Lawrence Ave. East (Golf Road & Midland Rd.). However, I would recommend trying the location on Midland as I have had better luck with them in the past few months.   Food- Luckies tends to be one of the more spicier Hakka restaurants that I have been to in comparison to other Hakka restaurants. The food is tasteful and the portions are HUGE. My favourite dishes are the Chilli Chicken, Manuchurian Chicken and the Schezuen  Shrimp. Each dish comes with a bowl of steam rice as well. However, if you order additional Fried Rice be warned that it's a LOT. 1 Fried rice is a little less than $8 but will fill up 3 people easy. Definitely recommend any of the Manchurian fried rice dishes over the regular fried rice.   Service-Average service. To be honest I wouldn't expect anything more from a Hakka Restaurant. The food is generally ready within about 10 mins.   Also, if you pay by cash they reduce the bill by about 15% (I think this is only for take out items though)."}
{"text":"First time here, and I was amazed at how yummy the food was. The interior looks like your everyday hakka place, so I was quick to judge. The portion sizes are large. I would say though they give a lot of vegetables with the protein dishes. Our table ordered some meat and tofu dishes and I would say about 70% was vegetables.  There's a lot of non-unique vegetarian options. It ranges from different types of tofu to different curries. They have a whole section for veggies on the menu.   Service wasn't terrible, wasn't the best the best either. You have to go up to them and ask for things such as if you need another glass of water.   I would highly recommend the chilli chicken here. My friend who comes often says it's her go to.   This is a great place for big groups to mix and mingle with different dishes."}
{"text":"We went this place the waitresses were rude and refused to serve us. No one I know would go to this place again. I have never seen such treatment of customers."}
{"text":"Singapore rice noodles Hot!  Soooo flavorful. Very good and we'll seasoned food dishes!  love it"}
{"text":"Delicious.  This place has been in Wexford for a while now."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE! Huge portions of rice and noodles filled past the container rim, delicious food and when you ask for SPICY.... ITS ACTUALLY SPICY! Not many places as liberal with spice as this place, most foods places when you ask spicy its tamed. I got Lucky learning about this place it truly is one of the best chinese food places I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I'll be a returning customer for sure. Thank you for existing in this world of mediocre copy cat Manchu woks, you my friends are on a whole other level please keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Chinese restaurants and I'm blessed that this one is close to me.  I like how they are willing to make things non-spicy and they are very always ready when you go to pick up."}
{"text":"Special Spicy Chicken is one of my all time favorite dishes. It's a little sweet, savory and spicy with a thick gravy on it. I drive 30min to get it as often as I can. The Manchurian fried rice and other dishes are awesome. It's the one place that fills my NYC Chinese food cravings but in terms of quality it's steps above most NYC Chinese food spots."}
{"text":"Lucky Chinese Restaurant is located in a strip plaza at Lawrence and Scarborough Gulf Club Road.  Most people would mistakenly call it Hakka food, but I would call it Chinese food made for Indian taste buds.  The misclassification stems from the known fact that the local Chinese population residing in India are predominantly Hakka Chinese.  While the root of most Chinese-Indian cuisine is indeed Hakka Chinese food, it is still erroneous to classify it as such.  Although the décor is authentically Chinese, you can tell just by looking up at the tv who their clientele is with Bollywood music videos beaming off the screen.The food here is spicy, but at least there's flavour.  The Chili Chicken was not just a plate of breaded chicken that was drenched in a salty soy sauce unlike some other establishments I've frequented.  If you can't handle your spicy, luckily they provide you with an entire pitcher of cold water upon seating.  Hot tea is available as well, but that just worsens the burning effect on your taste buds.  The Chili Chicken, albeit spicy, was quite flavourful.  The chilis in this dish really pack in the heat, luckily, it is served with a bowl of rice to counteract some of the fiery sauce.  I also ordered Chicken Pakoras, which are fried fritters that are made with varied ingredients depending on the region.  These ingredients can range from onions, to eggplant, to potato.  The ones at Lucky's were served with lime wedges.  The fritters were not too oily.  The outside was nice and crispy while the inside was tender.  I believe ours was of the Aloo Pakora variety, which is made with potato as the inside had the fluffy texture of a mashed potato.  Most fritters (think chicken balls) are quite bland and flavourless and must rely on the saving graces of a sauce, but these were great with just a squirt of lime juice.  Verdict:  Prices here are a little more than what most Chinese restaurants charge (usually around the $5-$6 range).  Our bill rang in at about $25 with tax and tip.  The portion sizes are sufficient, and we had some pakoras left over that we just couldn't finish.  The staff here are quick to respond and the food comes out pretty fast as well.  I can't quite decide which dish I liked better as both were good.  But I think if I had to choose one, it would've been the pakoras as it allowed me to enjoy my meal without needed an extinguisher to douse the inferno that was building in my mouth.  I know - I am a big wuss when it comes to spicy food but I'm building up my tolerance!  I am no expert when it comes to Chinese-Indian food, but the food at Lucky's is pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"Been going there for years. Although I have a lot of Hakka Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood, I prefer Lucky's to be the best."}
{"text":"I liked their chicken corn soup and chicken fried rice. Chicken pakora not bad. Definitely will go back. First time when went there, I liked that the waitresses walk across the room time to time in case you need anything else."}
{"text":"This is my favourite go-to hakka Chinese restaurant in the city. Service is a-ok, the food is freshly prepared and absolutely delicious. The place is always busy, portions are large, and prices are very low. The chili chicken is the best! The hakka noodles and rice are also staples in our order."}
{"text":"The couple of times I ventured all the way out to Scarborough was just to come here for their chili chicken. It is amazing, simply put. The manchurian fried rice is good too but I'm not to crazy about it.  This was the first hakka restaurant I had ever been to and I thought it was pretty amusing being in a Chinese restaurant that played Bollywood music videos and for once, the minority in the room"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 10 years and I haven't been disappointed once! I refuse to order take out from another hakka place. Their chilli chicken and spicy beef are their best dishes. I always order the chili chicken, beef, and pineapple chicken. I think they changed the recipe for the chilli chicken because a couple years ago it had more of a kick. Still a great dish."}
{"text":"The chicken pakoras are delicious, and have huge pieces of chicken, and potatoe. They are very spicy, but heck it's Hakka, so suck it up. These things will clear your sinuses. These are the biggest pakoras I've ever seen. The chicken spring rolls I had ordered were not greasy at all, and we're really crunchy and light. I know I've tried other dishes here in the past and have never been disappointed. The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. Great place for take out or dine in."}
{"text":"In India and other India related countries a specific type of chinese food exists. often immigrants from te Haka region migrate to these places and open up their on restaurants. These restaurants cater to the local spices and tastes and tend to be different and more spicier than the average chinese meal. these meals are often erroneously referred to as Hakka Chinese. The dishes like \"curry chow mein\" aren't actually typical Hakka dishes, just the people who are owning the restaurant are from the area.  Luck Chinese specializes in not actual hakka chinese food, but the Indianezed version of chinese food. It's sort of like Americanized Chinese food, just Indianized instead.   In this restaurant it is very obvious who the target clientele is, Indian music videos play in the background, and most of the customers I usually see are also Indians.  Ambiance - Nothing really super special, nice enough decor, has a bar, appears to be clean.  Service - The service here is usually pretty good. They are nice enough, and they are willing to help people who don't know much  Food- I LOVED their pickled carrot dish! It's delicious. Also I like the noodle dishes that they have. they let you chose your spiciness and it is usually accurate. I hate it when I order a 3/5 and get bland stuff. Other than that I like most of the dishes I have had here, I have been going for years, and it is one of my favorite places to go. The meals are really reasonably priced, and well worth it."}
{"text":"Singapore noodles with chicken and shrimp are fantastic! Chilli chicken was spicy, seasoned very well. Again large portion on the meat dish, enough for 2 and still some leftovers for the next day. Large dining room with a TV in the center playing some bollywod songs. Servers are polite, no complaints whatsoever. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My brother introduced it to as many years ago. We often have Lucky's HAKKA food once a month! Its so yummy!"}
{"text":"Chilli chicken and veggie spring rolls  yummmm been coming here for years and it is always amazing ! Fast efficient service and tasty food ..what more could anyone ask for"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  Portions are very good and the food is excellent.  There are two noodle dishes, the vegetable singapore rice noodles (spicy), and manchurian vegetable chow mein (spicy) that are impossible to choose between.  Both have gorgeous flavour and huge portions.  The one dish that presents a question is the ginger beef.  A couple of times we've ordered this and it had a weird smokey flavour and was saucy.  Once we ordered and received something much more like we expected, crispy, gingery beef with no smokey flavour.  Overall, quality is good, pricing is decent and the staff are nice."}
{"text":"Lucky's Chinese can be good, sometimes. The service is great but the food, the food comes out different each time you order it. I live in the area and I thought \"Hey this food taste pretty good I'll order it again once in a while\". Every \"Once in a while\" the texture, the food it changes, I order the same thing over and over again. it texture turns out worse, and worse. If I expected the flavor to change i'd expect it to change in a \"Its edible\" way. The only thing that stays the same and edible is the steamed rice. The food is good, depending on what/or when you order. I'd recommend it, if your looking for a cheap but large meal that can last you days."}
{"text":"I love chinese a little mild, and while I am use to eating that, this was a great twist on flavor and spices.  My kids didn't enjoy much, they don't like the spicy food, the hot and sour soup is Hot/spicy, but yummy.  a family of 6 kids and 6 adults, when kids didn't eat much so we had quite a bit of leftover cost around $120 + tip.  which is okay. Portions were a little on small, but we didn't mind.  a dinner order of Schezuane (sorry about spelling) chicken or beef, is good for two people.   Place quite crowded, if you have a big party call and reserve or wait in parking lot.  even with the crowd service is quite fast and prompt."}
{"text":"Not sure why there aren't more reviews. Good food. A bit on the spicy side if you're into spicy. Although they do accommodate if you don't. I usually get less less spicy for my Special Spicy Chicken. It's my favourite dish and pairs well with some Fried wontons. This location is more quiet than the other one. Wait times are more bearable. One of the better if not one of the best hakka restaurants around."}
{"text":"I've had the spicy thin rice noodles and an order of sweet and sour chicken balls. I was a bit aprensive about the Indian style Chinese food but was pleasently surprised with the taste and portion size. HUGE portions...my Wife and I hade the noodles for 4 meals!!!! The chicken balls were incredible, so much chicken and very little batter. It also comes with white rice so you have enough for a few meals. I really want to try something else on there menu now that I know the food is good.   The restaurant itself looks really clean but I found it a bit weird that you can see the kitchen while you are paying, we took it to go. But again looked and smelled quite clean. It is funny because they had a bollywood movie going and our family does not understand the language but they quite wrapped up in the story and when the food came they wanted to know how it ended, lol I thought it was funny. Took about 10 min for our food to be ready so I don't think it was a long wait."}
{"text":"Bland food with little or no flavour.  Chilli chicken which everyone raves about here was disappointing.   vegetable forced rice, seafood noodles and beef noodles were all bland.  food took longer to prepare than other restaurants even though the restaurant was empty at the time."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum  Eggplant in garlic sauce was excellent also.  I love everything on the menu"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is delicious. Hakka Chinese cuisine. My favorites, chicken pakora, chili chicken, chili beef to name a few. The quality and quantity is so amazing. They even have halal if you are wondering. The prices are very reasonable for the sizable quantity they serve. If you order take away and pay in cash, they even give you a 10% discount. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Chinese decor with Bollywood films playing on the TVs, I have been to this small but nice restaurant a few times to sample some dishes.   Chilli Chicken, & Chilli Fish were really good, the spicy sauces permeated deeply into the flesh & resulted in delicious bite sized pieces of chicken & fish with full flavor throughout.  Chicken & Fish Pakoras were dark golden brown, crisp shell & the leavened interior was moist & infused with the flavors of each respective meat.  Vegetable fried rice is a great accompaniment with any meat dish as assorted vegetables such as, baby corn, onions & cubed peppers are plentiful throughout the mix.  I recommend this place for great spicy food at an easy going price."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant experience I've had this side of the Pacific? Likely. Great food, staff is extremely knowledgeable and helped to guide us through their selections and how they are prepared. Our waitress' recommendations were spot-on. Various staff delivered the dim sum and main dishes, each providing a meaningful explanation of what was presented. In all, it was a great dining experience, and this is an excellent restaurant. Applause well deserved!"}
{"text":"Usually we love this place, but the vegetable pakora is quite literally the foulest tasting pakora I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I never drive through the area without  stopping at Lucky's for some shrimp pakoras and chilli chicken.  The place is the epitome of consistency.  The warm tantalizing pakoras are always perfectly fried with the right proportions of dough, shrimp and green chilli peppers.  The staff are courteous and on the ball.  Another location further west would make my life easier and fatter."}
{"text":"Hi there Hakka freaks, I winced a bit when I read one of the reviews. It was a good review, a positive review, but when the woman wrote that the Hakka noodles and Chilli chicken are staples when she orders I thought to myself: \"I'm glad they never put any staples in my food.\"  *   *    *    *    *    *    *  I am devouring yet another giant portion of Singapore Rice Noodles, and they're excellent.  Big chunks of chicken, #25 size shrimp, spanish onions & green onions, red pepper, bean sprouts & garam masala. As usual, I'm enjoying a cold beer with my lunch and will probably stumble over to my hovel to a long afternoon nap after I negoiate this pile of noodles."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite hakka Chinese restaurants. Almost everything here taste amazing. Some of my favourites are the seafood soup, chilli chicken, chilli shrimp, any of the manchurian dishes and fried rice, pakoras, wings, fried banana dessert and Singapore noodles.   * I would recommend dining in store rather than takeout only because the food is more fresh and you get large portions."}
{"text":"This review is only for take-out. Huge, huge portions, I'm not even sure how they got it all in the box.  We had the manchurian chicken fried rice, manchurian eggplant, and chili chicken with sauce. Fried rice was standard, nothing that would make me go there versus other hakka places, other than the extreme portion size. Manchurian eggplant was better than I had at most places, actual large chunks of eggplant versus smaller strips of eggplant I've had at my usual hakka spot, Lin Garden. Chili chicken was also fantastic. If it wasn't so far I would go back here all the time!  Pay cash for take out and get 10% off over $15-20 order (can't remember the exact amount)."}
{"text":"Recommended to us by a friend, this place serves enormous portions, so you can ignore the rather scanty list of appetizers.  The food is more Chinese-ey and less Indian than Kim Kim which is another \"Hakka\" favourite.  We ordered Hakka Chow Mein, Singapore Noodles and Crispy Beef, all of which were great, espieally the last (but watch out for the little green chilis which are diabolically hot and can easily become camouflaged in the sauce).  As an FYI, this place, like most \"Hakka\" Indo-Chinese places, is Halal and serves no pork.  No decor to speak of.  Service was brupt but friendly.    Prices are extremely reasonable, especially given the portion size and use of Halal meat."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 lunch specials and chicken wings.  Chicken fried rice, $6.99. Chicken wings, $8.75  Both are ok.  The fried rice came with a spring roll."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty foods. Provided a pitcher of water (which was definitely needed after the level of spicyness) and the restaurant was blasting the air conditioning (which I also understood why after eating)!"}
{"text":"The food is a real treat.  Intense flavors, freshly prepared, totally delicious, but substantial and comforting.    The strip mall location, and the drive to get there are both serious drawbacks, however.  For as much as we liked this place, we almost never ate there.    But maybe if you have some annoying errand to run in the Wexford area, this restaurant can ease the pain."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, just dropped in for takeout. I'm pretty sure me and my boyfriend have gotten food here once a week for the past three weeks. The people that work here are very friendly and very helpful, if there's anything you want to know about the dishes they'll explain it to you. We've tried the chili chicken, egg fried rice with chicken, beef and broccoli, fried noodles with chicken, sweet and sour chicken balls, egg fried rice with shrimp, spring rolls, and cashew chicken. Everything has been fantastic! This is definitely our go-to place for chinese food and it doesn't hurt that it's about a 2 minute walk from where I live!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant of all time, and I've lived in New York and Los Angeles, as well as several other cities in the continental United States and Europe. Maybe if I visit China itself, I'll find something approaching how delicious Lucky's is, but I doubt anything could ever come close.  The secret menu, originally printed only in Chinese, but now available in English as well, is a treasure trove of authentic Schezuan dishes for which there are no equals. Twice-cooked pork, spicy sliced beef, real kung pao chicken, pork with brown sauce - it's all here, and it's all amazing.  Start off with a bowl of the dan-dan noodles. They are perfection in a tiny porcelain dish. Spicy, and with a tiny bit of ground pork, these were my after-school snack growing up.  Recently Luckys changed hands, and while the food and service are still excellent (the current owners were trained over the course of an entire year by the previous owners, who were also the cooks) there will always be a certain element missing for me now: The Tseng family, one of the most wonderful families I have ever had the honor to know."}
{"text":"Been to this place several times since the early 90s. Last visit was very disappointing. We were party of four. As usual not the friendliest greeting. We ordered few beers, chilli chicken, house special fried rice and chilli beef. Food came out almost immediately, as it was pre made. Chilli chicken was cold and dry. Other items were OK. Probably I will try different place next time."}
{"text":"Went back to one of our favourite Hakka waiter recommend the chicken balls of course I ordered it with the usual chilli chicken with rice the food came tried the chicken balls just say I wouldn't order it again small chicken balls of course also the waiter said you get 8 balls counted in was only 7as the waiter who recommended it said to him only 7 balls told him guess the guy in the kitchen can't count or he drop one on the floor waiter started laughing. After he finished laughing told me don't order the balls again. Told him how about we don't come here anymore he started laughing again I guess he doesn't go out much."}
{"text":"Great food, not greasy and huge portions.  A little more expensive (and I mean very little) than other hakka places but when you consider the portion and quality.  WELL WORTH IT.  I recently moved to Whitby and still drive to the boroughs for Luckys Hakka."}
{"text":"They have increased their prices. Ordered chicken hakka chowmein and chilli beef. Beef has a lot of meat and enough kick. Im kinda disappointed with the chowmein. Noodles is undercooked (a bit hard) and oily. Chilli chicken is still their best seller. Im supposed to order party tray this weekend but i will settle with Spicy Dragon for price and portions. I will come back for Chilli Chicken only."}
{"text":"I decided to grab dinner at lucky tonight and as alway they never disappoint. I got the beef curry again and it was great. This resturant is 5/5 in my opinion. Great service Great food Good place for groups. Price is decent."}
{"text":"Just grabbed some take-out for my company...  Brought it all the way back.... Only to find out there are no chopsticks no spoons no forks but yet they remembered to put the spare chilli oil & green chilli sauce containers  P.S our company is not near any restaurants so its not like we can just go ask our neighbors... we ended up wasting a lot of time driving around trying to look for plastic or even metal spoons"}
{"text":"I have to admit the Chilli Chicken is really good.Most of the other dishes ordered were also pretty decent - egg fried rice, eight treasures.  I wasn't very impressed with the Hot and Sour soup or the dessert - fried bananas which was purple inside (?) and very hard (the spoon went flying trying to cut through it) I did like the honey vanilla ice cream though! Service was good and the old school Bollywood videos they were playing added to the amusement for the evening."}
{"text":"This is the place for Hanover food. Our order is usually composed of chilli chicken, Hakka noodles, and sometimes beef fried rice. We skip the Manchurian fried rice as it's not our favourite.  The prices here are amazing, pay with cash if you got it and the serving sizes are huuuge. We've never eaten in just always had the takeout there's always leftovers.  This place tends to get busy so calling in your order is key. I'd like to try other things on the menu but these staples are done sooooo well.  Keep in mind the food is quite oily, but that's what makes KT taste so good.  Highly recommend this place if you've never been."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and we got the usual. Manchurian mix fried rice and chilli chicken (with gravy). The food was good as always, Luckys is properly one of my favourite Chinese restaurants.   However, the service wasn't that great. Despite the staff being kind, we constantly had to ask them for stuff we needed (e.g. the menu, water, straws, etc.)."}
{"text":"I love Lucky's, but I'm not a fan of this location. I rather do take-out from this location instead.  My family and I came here the other day for dinner. It was packed, however we got seated within a few minutes. I've taken out from this location multiple times, and do dine-in at the Midland location often. The service here was alright, not the worst but not the best. I felt like some waiters were extremely rude and rushing us. I understand you have many customers, but were paying you, not eating for free for you to rush us out within 45 minutes. Some of the waiters were really helpful and nice though.  The food came pretty quick after placing the order. We got two Manchurian fried rice, one spicy and one non-spicy. Both of them were amazing and the portions were really good. We also got chilli beef and chilli chicken. The portions were super small compared to usual! I mean when I do take-out I get way more, and the Midland location gives you way more for the same price. Both dishes were good, however I loved the chilli beef. Even though they were \"chilli\" dishes, both of them were not spicy.  I wouldn't dine-in at this location again, I rather go to the Midland and Lawrence location.   P.S. they don't have dessert here."}
{"text":"As a Toronto native, I grew up eating Federicks..but this place gives them a run for their money. The service is quick and they actually answer their phone. The portions are huuuuge, so get your sweatpants ready. Our go to's are the Manchurian noodles, fried rice, vegetable fried rice and chili tofu. This time we tried the vegetable pakora and they were sooo good! It's also a nice place to dine in and watch some Bollywood movies"}
{"text":"My most fav hakka chinese place for a fast ad quick dinner with friends and family. They have been around quite a while and I hope they stay in Toronto always expanding into more locations! I wish them success and luck all through."}
