{"text":"Went to Buttermilk for the first time tonight after randomly seeing it late one night while waiting for a bus across the street. I love the regular Monday night free cinema concept and it's well-equipped for it - it seemed like a fun date night idea for couples on a budget! The place was cosy with its warm lighting and comfortable seating, luckily being a Monday it was not super busy but you could tell a couple of people were in the know and sat around for the movie. It was a little difficult to find the movie listings in advance so my one suggestion would be for them to advertise on their site that movie listings are posted on their Instagram network (also would help to cross-promote to their social media)!

Food-wise, we had the Village ice cream waffle, the savoury Arugula waffle, and a custom banana and whip cream waffle that were all delicious. The waffles were perfectly cooked, texture was great, and there was consistently good flavours across the board. The Arugula waffle combined the peppery green with a spicy kick of chili oil with smooth cheese, the banana cream tasted a LOT like banana cream pie and was a top contender, but probably my favourite was the Village vanilla bean ice cream topped with sticky toffee drizzle with pecans. Cold+Hot=win in my humble opinion. And you can never go wrong with Village. Also had the fresh-squeezed orange juice - it is probably the freshest I've ever had! Ridiculously good. 

Fun fact - this business shares a brotherly sibling connection with Village Ice cream, so I expect good things to follow from Buttermilk as they find their legs (maybe a pizza waffle, or flavoured waffles like green tea matcha as mentioned by another reviewer). There should also be a banana cream pie waffle and/or special seasonal waffles (Pumpkin spice waffles anyone?). Village ice cream does so well I think because they offer new and exciting limited-run flavour combinations alongside classic recipes that appeal to regulars and newcomers alike. Buttermilk needs to adopt that model to really up its game but it's quite lovely regardless. Definitely go for the game nights or movie nights!"}
{"text":"I love the sweet AND savoury waffles here. Get one of each! They all come with some pretty instagram worthy flare. The staff is all very nice and they have game and movie nights. The birthday waffle has an extra special surprise!"}
{"text":"As I watched the three overwhelmed employees struggle with keeping up with orders, I became completely disgusted by the total lack of food safe practices. No gloves, dropping stuff, touching their face then touching the food. It was gross. I couldn't eat there, you shouldn't eat there unless you want staphylococcus food poisoning."}
{"text":"I'm a really big fan of waffles and after trying Buttermilk for the first time, all I can say is that I'm in love.

Although it is pricey for a sweet or savoury waffle the size and the flavour does make up for it! For those who never been to Buttermilk it is pretty simple just choose between savoury or sweet waffle and place your order, grab yourself complimentary water that can be found on the shelve towards your right, and take a seat with the number card that they gave you.

If you don't want to wait on your phone, Buttermilk does have board games and magazines that you can borrow and keep yourself entertained. 

Wait time isn't that long but depending on when and what time you go it might. Sweet waffles come out first/faster than savoury. Two waffles will be able to fill you up but if you want a snack, one can do.

The waffles are served on a Buttermilk stamped cookie sheet under a baking pan, unfortunately there isn't any special plating but the crisp and fluffiness of the waffle does make up for it.

I would recommend Buttermilk, they are a great place for a quick breakfast, late night snack or a snack in between. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty and cozy interior. That's all. Over priced and nothing special.
If u are just looking for the place for sitting down and chatting with friend for hours, this place would be good. But, just for waffle, eh ........."}
{"text":"It was good, but the portions could be a little bigger.  One waffle for my 230lb husband wasn't enough."}
{"text":"This is a fabulously decorated little shop that smells so delicious. We visited late on a Friday evening, it was busy but not packed.
 the young lady at the front counter was super bubbly and made some suggestions, as we weren't sure what we wanted. 
The menu is very small. They currently only have sweet waffles to choose from, but they all looked delicious.
We ended up ordering the Village Waffle (Village ice cream, caramel, whip cream and pecans) 
The waffles were warm and soft, and of course they used all the best ingredients.
The only detractor for me is that for $15 for two waffles, for the portion size, it's on the expensive side.
Needless to say, a great little place for a date, a group meet or somewhere to take mom."}
{"text":"I would say this is overpriced for what it is. I do like that they have board games and show movies! The space is cute but I'm hesitant to pay so much for a waffle - especially when it's not my favourite food. The toppings were yummy but the waffle itself wasn't cooked properly - over cooked. Maybe it's improved since I went!"}
{"text":"Nice chill atmosphere with friendly staff. They provide wifi and board games to enjoy during your meal. Their freshly-squeezed orange juice is to die for. I had the fruit waffle (homemade waffle, raspberry cream, and seasonal fruit) and it was delicious. I glanced around at other diners' choices and they looked/smelled really good too"}
{"text":"Okay, not fantastic. We assumed the waffles would come with maple syrup, or that syrup would be at the tables. But it only comes (I think) with the original waffle. Our waffles were a bit dry and boring. What got me is the ingredients - most places that proudly display their ingredients are using local, organic, high quality stuff. They actually had Robin Hood flour and Rogers sugar on display - the cheap stuff you buy at Safeway. For $13 for a plate of waffles, is it too much for me to be expecting they use Highwood Crossing flour? Or blueberries that weren't frozen five minutes ago? It's okay in here, but I think they either need to make great waffles or make cheap waffles. Not expensive average ones."}
{"text":"I ordered the ham and cheese waffle. 
My friends got the Rueben....this was the one that looked the best. 
Waffle was soft and delicious. It came promptly. 
Unfortunately they didn't have coffee ready a couple times. 
The orange juice was freshly squeezed...it smelt good. 
The dish bins were full and dirty. There wasn't really anyone in there so the fact that no cleaning was getting done was a turn off. 
I'd come back for a stop if someone wanted too...but definitely need the staff to move it."}
{"text":"Walked by last week and have been waiting to try it out. Checked out the menu online. This morning still being chilly, I headed out downtown, paid for parking, waited for 9am. Sat at the counter for a bit, then a gal came up and asked if I been there before, No, it was my first time. She told me they were out of paper menu's but the menu was above the counter and some specials.  I knew I wanted a coffee and cinnamon bun waffle, sounded delicious. She said let us know when your ready to order, quickly walked away.  Then all 5 staff dissapeared into the back, after 5 minutes longer waiting.  I left...  not to waste my morning, drive downtown and parking, I found another new place for breakfast, where i was greeted and had a coffee within seconds."}
{"text":"My favorite waffle place with great ambiance, staff and menu selections. There is also an added bonus of introducing Chicken (from Anju restaurant) & Waffles on Friday for their anniversary which I really appreciate that. I recommend Earl Grey, Reuben and Arugula Waffles. They also had seasonal menu items to feature like the sausage they had previously due to the Calgary Stampede show. Every visit (rarely), there is something new on the menu which can be a great way to come back to try it out. Perhaps the only downside for some would be the price as it is on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Service was good nothing special, although the waffles were relatively cheap and very delicious. I absolutely recommened to anyone who likes waffles"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with a friend of mine one morning for breakfast. It had a really good atmosphere to it. The place had a relaxed vibe where you can grab some board games and water while you eat your meal. 
The waffles were amazing! I got the cinnamon bun waffles while my friend had the fruit waffles. They seemed to be made fresh in an iron cast waffle maker. 
They had a selection between sweet and savory waffles but as good as they are, they seemed to be a bit over-priced. 

However, the service was not all that great. It would have been nice if the servers could have checked up on us to see if everything went okay. and while we were ordering our waffles and I asked for their opinion on what they think is the best waffle to get, they seemed like they were in a rush to just get our orders in and it seemed like they just say whatever they think would please me. The place was not even busy."}
{"text":"We went into Buttermilk for lunch, around noon... it was not too busy and we got to order right away.

I just got a simple plain waffle with syrup and strawberries, I wanted to see how good the actual waffle was without the \"extras\". It wasn't long at all before a nice server brought it over... I looked at it, all cute and square... then, I took a bite.  HOLY WAFFLE HEAVEN. 

It was crispy but moist but fluffy with a bit of chewy, Deeeelicious!

I also got one of their premixed fresh fruit drinks... I forget what they called it but it had watermelon with mint and lime...it was like I was having a little spa party every time I took a sip. 

So now the task will be to go back and try the more exciting waffles and JUDGE. Savory, here I come!"}
{"text":"The orange juice alone gets this place 3 stars! There's is nothing like fresh squeezed OJ in the morning; it's like the nector of the Gods. Getting a while pitcher of it is a great deal too. We got five glasses out of it. The rest comes from the delicious waffles they make. We tried the seasonal waffle, a banana and Nutella one, and the Reuben waffle. The banana and Nutella was good. The wake was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside with all the deliciousness of Nutella and sliced bananas. What surprised me was how amazing the Rueban waffle was. The pastrami and the cheese melted together in a flavor filled blast of awesomeness. It went to another level when it was dotted in Mama's secret sauce. We loved it so much that we had to grab some extra sauce to enjoy the waffle. Going to be coming back to enjoy these waffles more often!"}
{"text":"Waffles are delicious and the pricing is decent. Would definitely get two waffles next time. Not totally thrilled with the order and then seat yourself idea but it does make for a good, quick place to stop and eat. Would like it more if they had a larger drink selection. Cappuccinos and lattes would go perfectly with these waffles in this type of setting."}
{"text":"Nowadays, every breakfast/lunch restaurant will include waffles on their menu. Usually, it isn't quite that good. Coming to a waffle specialized store, I was expecting quite a bit. 

With the same owner as Village Ice Cream, Buttermilk definitely didn't disappoint. A perfectly crispy waffle with the Village ice cream, pecans, and chocolate sauce on top. Each element paired beautifully with each other, and tasted amazing!

Cute decor and spacious, comfortable place, a nice place to visit and try for sure. Definitely a large waffle per order though, so you gotta make sure you're hungry for it!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Buttermilk after passing by it for months. We arrived shortly before the lunch hour and liked the look of the place - clean and bright, modern but not too eclectic. 

Ordered the 2 sweet waffles for $14 and a savory for $8. Fresh squeezed orange juice ($5), coffee ($3) and watermelon agua ($5). Placed our order at the counter, took our drinks and sat down with a numbered placard to wait. 

The juice and coffee were good, but the agua was disappointing. Barely any watermelon flavour and was meh for the price.

Waffles are served on cookie sheets rather than plates. Our sweet ones came out long before our savory one. 

We tried the lemon curd & goat cheese, which was a delicious combination of flavours and there was a good amount of both ingredients on the waffle. The fruit one came with raspberry cream, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Was good, but pretty standard and could have used more berries. For the savory, we tried the Reuben and I really liked the ingredients used. The meat had the right amount of saltiness, and there was a decent amount of sauerkraut and sauce. The extra sauce for dipping was appreciated and the pickles were cold and crunchy.

The waffles themselves had a nice texture - soft and fluffy on the inside with a crisp edge. I just wish there was more flavour to them since I found them a bit bland. 

Got quite busy as lunch hour hit, so I'm glad we got there early. I like that they have movie night, game night, etc. Something different is always nice."}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service right to when you walked in and when you left!! The owners really care about how their business is doing and how they can improve! I loved how you had options between sweet and savory waffles and how you can get fruit on the side. I'm definitely wanting to go back their soon!"}
{"text":"Really good waffles! I'd go back! Fresh squeezed orange juice that's the bomb. I had the coffee waffle with chocolate and bananas. Very tasty! 

Waffle is cooked perfectly! Good coffee."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect spot for teenagers who want to take their loved ones out. Nice decor and super friendly staff. Prices are average $9 for a waffle. I set by the bar and my God the orange juice machine smells good. The waffle was good I shared it with a friend. Coffee is basic so don't expect any fancy shmancy latte."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch! Fresh squeezed orange juice, thick crispy waffle, from sweet to savoury its all delicious. Not only is the food amazing but the staff are all so friendly. The owner himself walks around and  checks on the patrons. My favourite part of this restaurant is the board games. They have a little selection of games you can play at your table or you can bring your own. It makes for a very fun experience. Thank you buttermilk for being such an awesome spot!"}
{"text":"They probably should be more creative with the waffles and the batter is just basic. Nothing special that sets them apart from real restaurants that do waffles for brunch. Get creative make sourdough waffles, do herb infused waffles. What's the point in opening a waffle restaurant and not experimenting with the batter? Is it laziness? Is it fear? I've been here 3 times and all 3 times I left disappointed and wanting more from buttermilk waffles. Gonna leave out the fine because it's not fine. Just basic. The toppings also need work"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We deliberately skipped dessert at pigeonhole to give this place a try but I wished we hadn't.  The waffles were nothing special and the toppings were scarce.  I found the waffles themselves a tad soft and it quickly became soggy with the sauces.

Very pricey for mediocrity..."}
{"text":"If your looking for a delicious snack and a relaxed atmosphere, this is a great place. The waffles are perfectly fresh and full of flavour. They also offer board games and a family friendly environment."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends while we were in town on vacation. The menu is nothing but variations on waffles including waffles with ice cream. I am not big on sweets but wanted to make sure I got syrup so the only logical thing for me was to get the original. It was a decent waffle. Overall I think I would rather go to a restaurant where there are more options than just waffles. I had a friend with the cinnamon roll waffle and she really enjoyed it. Two of the guys in our group got the ham waffle and both really liked it. However, within an hour or so everyone was ready for a more substantial meal. I would probably only come here if I was looking for dessert only."}
{"text":"Had the cinnamon bun waffle to satisfy my late night craving for a cinnamon bun. So good!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin this experience was terrible from the beginning. It took 20 minutes to find parking on a Wednesday. Then when we got inside it wasn't too busy there were places to sit.

Service 2/5- the front girl taking order was so disorganized and couldn't get our order right. The food took forever to come. Only reason why I gave 2/5 is the waiter who brought the food to our table was polite.

3/5 for the waffles. They were okay. The waffle was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. However the toppings where meh! I had the ham which was okay ask for a side of maple syrup and it'll make it taste much better. The village waffle with sticky toffee was good but it became soggy by the time ate it. 

Overall tried it but most likely won't come back."}
{"text":"The lemon goat cheese one was not as good as I thought. The lemon sauce was too sour. The pecan cinnamon was better. I rather spend $7 for village ice cream though. Their waffle cone is waay better."}
{"text":"I think I went there with more expectations. I just didn't like their list of options on the menu. The girl who was serving us needed to learn to smile . Seemed like she was forced to serve customers. I liked their arugula waffle way more than blueberry waffle. It felt like it was missing something, imperfect. Would I go there again? - maybe.  I think bringing more varieties will attract more people. Cause few people  I have spoken to they all said the same thing."}
{"text":"The service was awful. We waited in line for nearly 20 minutes prior to even ordering our waffles. This was in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and the place wasn't even busy. Once we ordered we played games and waited for over half an hour before receiving simple waffles. They were not filling, or overly impressive. It's $10+ for a single waffle. We were given one ticket for a free plain waffle in the future for our wait. The place isn't worth going to and we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I got the \"Village\" waffle which has village vanilla ice cream, melted chocolate & whipped cream for about $9. It was really good & fills you up. We waited a bit but it was worth it. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"New to 17th avenue and all things waffle!! Six types of waffles or enjoy the al a carte! We had the Lemon Curd with crumbled goat cheese and the Fruit waffles. You grab a seat then order at the counter; pay attention for your order or someone might bring it to you. It's pretty busy but we managed to grab a corner at the long table. 

Everything tastes awesome though we do think they should offer some more savoury options!!"}
{"text":"I ate at \"Buttermilk Fine Waffles\" last night and it was the best experience thus far. I kept thinking, why haven't I come here sooner? 
They have a small menu which to some may be a deterrent but I love local restaurants with small menus because it makes it easier to make a decision. A majority of there waffles are sweet but they do have three savory waffles and three Waffle bowls. I don't know how the Waffle bowl would work but it sounds interesting and I do definitely want to try this sometime. 
My friend and I went for dinner so we got the savory waffles and we got the combo with the drink and chips for $15. That's not bad given the rootbeer is locally made and the first ingredient is water then cane sugar so I was a fan of it. I was just going to get the Waffle and root beer drink not in a combo but then the cashier told me to and that these chips were \"delicious\" and definitely worth it so I blight why not I'll try them. I asked if they were made here or locally .. nope the cashier says. They just come in a bag but still they are \"delicious\". I get my meal and there the brand ruffles plain chips.. so I was a little upset about that. Definitely not worth the extra two dollars but that's it and that's why this place lost one star but other than that it's amazing. 
I got the ham Waffle so I would definitely recommend it. 
I also got a sweet Waffle for dessert and chose the Nutella banana Waffle and it was incredible !! 
Definitely recommend just don't get chips when they offer :)"}
{"text":"Great little waffle boutique. We split an order of blueberry waffles and cinnamon bun waffles (2 each); both were great. Light and fluffy. Definitely a great addition to Calgary's food scene. Downsides, if it had any, fairly loud...but probably because it was busy"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the unique selection of waffles they had your classic waffle to a Reuben waffle, which was delicious. A little pricey, hence the 4/5 stars and the lemon sauce on my waffle was a little too bitter for my liking, but otherwise great. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today and it did not disappoint. For starters, cute place and great branding. Nice selection of toppings and great to have both savoury and sweet options. Price discount if you're sharing a couple of waffles, which was a nice touch. We each had a savoury waffle and split a sweet one, which was the perfect amount of food for two people. The waffles were perfect: crispy, moist on the inside, and the perfect amount of toppings. The flavours were well balanced. The only thing that detracted from a 5-star rating was the fact that there were a few yellowed pieces of arugula in my waffle topping. It's kind of cute that the place is operated entirely by teenagers (go trust and empowerment) but unlike more seasoned kitchen staff, that comes at the expense of having the maturity of being a practiced cook and knowing to pick through the arugula leaves before serving to pick out any that past their prime, as arugula doesn't tend to keep very week, so yellowing sets in early. Minor detail but makes a difference. Other than that little hiccup, definitely a stellar experience and worth a return visit."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast, lunch or even dessert venue. You walk in to an open concept, order at the front style diner. The waffle menu is on a chalk board at the front. There is a selection of savoury and sweet waffles. I ended up sharing three waffles with a friend and it was a perfect amount. If you are really hungry I would suggest ordering 2 waffles to yourself. They come out on a baking pan! So cute :)

We ordered a cinnamon roll, blueberry and arugula waffle. The arugula was the best! I would definitely go back to try some for just dessert. There are an assortment of waffles with ice cream toppings. I even noticed they play movies on a projector on Monday nights. Great date idea!"}
{"text":"We had the savory H.A.M. waffle and savory arugula waffle. They were both super good! It's a fun atmosphere inside, with high ceilings and board games if you want to play. The staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"Had the waffle  Benedict, the salted Carmel Sunday waffle and the coffee crisp waffle. The waffles are light and crispy.  Some of the best waffles I have ever had. The Carmel Sunday waffle had ice cream, whipped cream, pecans, almonds and salted Caramel sauces. Really sweet really good. The eggs Bennie was very good. They only serve this until 12:30. The coffee crust was also outstanding. Can't wait to try the Ruben waffle."}
{"text":"Buttermilk waffles makes amazing waffles, although they are a little over priced, it's not much of a meal there not super filling but a great snack or desert. Everyone needs to go here at least once"}
{"text":"1st visit last July 2015. Value for money is the 1st priority for me for a place, so this review im afraid, will not be kind. The girly wanted to try it, as she likes waffles, so thought what the heck. Nice enough inside, obviously spent a pretty penny refitting whatever it was before, fresh and clean, airy without being too overly lit. Staff are nice. Place is clean and comfy.

 I order for the girly and I, I pick the ham and waffle savory thing (over $10 IIRC), the girly plumps for the blueberry thingy. I look at the menu board, inwardly im thinking \"Holy crap? $8 for waffles?\" and assumed I would be getting a good 4 chunky waffles, for the plain waffles option (Waffle batter can be bought for pennies) or a 'dennys' style portion.

Total including pop and coffee was inwardly eye watering, but didn't want to make a scene so just paid.

Trays arrive. They do this cute thing where ones 'plates' are waffles served on parchment paper on a lovely ultra clean baking tray. My portion is....2. Two tiny waffles and a sliver or 2 of ham that looks like it was warmed over from a resealable bulk pack. The girly's was the same but with blueberries.

2....waffles? Inwardly i'm annoyed for being reeled in. I rationalise and think that surely the girl will come over with another 2 when we are almost finished. Nope. Too bad. One just gets 2 measly waffles. One can practically inhale them in a few mouthfuls. Honestly, the last time I was this inwardly incredulous at the miserly portions was at 'Sultans Tent' (see seperate review)- the current reigning champ of the 'You gotta be kidding me right?' - school of value, type reaction when the plate is put in front you.

We leave, my stomach still grumbling, girly seems happy as tiny ladies eat less I guess. I speculate to myself that perhaps the ground rent is sky high or the refit costs are crazy and the ownder needs to recoup costs, but this isnt the way to go about it. Yes, a biz needs to make a profit, but come on, 8 bucks for 2 plain tiny average tasting waffles and a blink inducing THREE dollars for a small cup of coffee, isnt the way to go. One can go a km or so away and have a gut busting 'Cowboy Breakfast' at Humpty's for a few bucks more, AND bottomless coffee! (which doesnt taste like boiled road tar a'la Starbucks)

Lower the prices or UP the portion sizes, watch footfall increase, yes its a lower margin, but better keeping it constantly busy than having the place with tumbleweeds running through.

 Wasnt busy when we went in last year, and it wasnt busy when I went in on Sat evening tonight. 2 other folk inside. Coffee is still $3 bucks, and still burnt tasting, extremely bitter and lukewarm.

I have no idea what it is with new catering businesses opening along 17th ave being totally at odds on pricing models to what is happening in the economy. AB is undergoing a recession as the tar sands collapse, and theres businesses going bust along 17th ave so fast I lose track. La Villa, Corbeaux Bakery, Tilted Kilt, Resto 901 bar. All (I suspect) casualties of too trendy pricing and not enough money to serve their fantasy market. The political logo at the rear of this restaurant is a little bizarre too.

Waffle house folks, sincerely, its a lovely place, but unless you adjust to the reality of your market, I cant see you surviving, and I want you to, as I like to support local biz - unless - I cant afford them. Don't be another La Villa.

Without a change of course,  I give this waffle house 2 years."}
{"text":"On my way to work, I stopped in one Saturday morning,,treated my staff to waffles, I tried a few different fruit topping waffles. They were delicious, and I am not usually a fan of waffles. This place is nicely done up, simple and delicious. I liked that you can help yourself to tap water, I found the service a bit slow that day but I'm sure it was just keeping up making waffles! My favourite is the plain waffle with butter and syrup. Simple sweet and delicious! A must try for sure. They also have one waffle topped with Village Icecream, that's gonna be my next to try!"}
{"text":"I really don't get what people like about this place. I hate giving bad reviews but this place was just such a disappointment. The waffles are sub par compared to other local breakfast/brunch places that don't even specialize in waffles. The waffle batter was plain and the toppings were underwhelming. I noticed that there were a few super-sweet sounding waffles with icecream and such and I think maybe that's what some people go for? The atmosphere and service are great but I come for the food and it just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable stop for breakfast or a late night desert option!


I am a fan of waffles, normally I try to relegate them to birthday waffles and boxing day chicken and waffles (yes, just two times a year, waffles are special dammit!) But I broke my rule to try these... twice...

I actually was there on opening day. It seemed like they had a few kinks to work out, but still a pretty good start. The second visit did not disappoint. The home made toffee sauce is so good!

My only complaint is that I think the waffles could be cooked a touch longer. I like a crispy outside and a soft inside, i think they need another 10-15 seconds in the iron. Just my thoughts, to each his own waffle, i suppose. None the less, if you like waffles even a little, this place will hit the spot! Plus. village ice cream! on a waffle! Daaaaaaaaaamn!"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about their waffles so I was really excited to check it out today. Also, it was lilac festival so they had a limited time lilac waffle that I got the chance to try as well. Didn't know you could eat lilacs so that was exciting to learn haha
The store had a cozy feel where we had to order up front and then sit wherever and then they brought out the waffles to us. There was no wait to sit down and we went around 10 am. We tried the lilac waffle and the ham savoury waffle with earl grey tea to drink. I would have liked more drink options such as lattes or cappuccinos so that's something they could work on in the future. 
The lilac waffle had lilac syrup and custard topped with almonds and blackberries. It had a very faint lilac scent and flavour which was great because it wasn't overpowering the waffle. The waffle itself was so soft and the toppings were a great addition to this combo. The ham waffle also had the perfect waffle base topped with ham and cheese with a side of siracha sauce. I loved trying one of their dessert and savoury options - it came together really well. 
They have a games night on Wednesdays and a movie night on Thursdays with $5 waffles which is awesome so I would love to check it out."}
{"text":"Dragged bf here just before noon to try the waffles. Workers were friendly and showed us the menu, but also sort of cold. With the mix and match for $14, I got the lemon curd and goat cheese waffle, bf tried the fruit waffle. While we waited, the restaurant was mostly empty and offered blissful A/C from the scorching sun. I checked out the decorations, which are nice and suitable for a trendy dessert place such as this one. They offer water from this stylish tap and it's pretty innocuous - by the back wall. Our waffles were served on a metal tray, which was good for sharing but a little weird. The lemon curd goat cheese waffle was delicious! Bf expressed that his fruit waffle was way too sweet. It seemed to have a sweet sauce drizzled all over it - really not to our tastes. 

I might visit again, but I don't think I'll be giving this place any special attention because it's just not that astounding."}
{"text":"A great place to have waffles and being Belgian, I know my waffles! Great variety of waffles and atmosphere. We had Black Forest waffles, Eggs Benny waffles and fruit waffles- all great. We will be back!"}

Review by Moe Age 10 for Father's Day, visit of 4 people, 2 adults 2 kids

Food Quality:  food was good, everything tasted ok.  standard for waffles in my short experience.  there was nothing wrong with the waffles, nothing super.  A few  items are a bit unusual but still are good ( I.e   lemon waffle ) the rest were very average.

The Arugula waffle was order with chips and this part was very dissapointing because for $2 they just add a handful of store bought chips.

What we had:
Ruben waffle, Arugula waffle, Lemon goat cheese waffle, Birthday waffle (ice cream and whip cream)


Price / Value:   a premium price for a regular experience, dad tells that this is in part for the location.  
The waffles were not filling at all you would need at least two to fill you up, so if your very hungry keep in mind that one waffle is not going to fill you up


Ambience:  very boring, felt like cafeteria seating, shared tables, chairs not that comfortable (no back support).  décor is bland.  washroom was clean.  Busy but tables became available quickly.


Service:  not much to say since, it is very self serve counter style order.  they do bring the food to you.  There was no big water jugs all they had were these little cups that you would have to keep on going to the station and refill your cup.  The cups were so small that in one sip all the water in the cup would be gone.

Overall / Presentation:   
My goal is to be a breakfast / waffle expert critic.   Out of 4 people, nobody said that they would make the trek all the way down from the SE of Calgary for these waffles.  

 
If I where to compare this  to another waffle restaurant named Waffleton ( which I highly recommend though its in Waterton);  Waffleton would be like gold and Buttermilk Fine Waffles would be like a regular stone."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and I honestly can say it's not that great. I've had better waffles elsewhere that didn't specialize in waffles. Services is great and friendly but I wasn't full by the end of my \"meal\" and I found it overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great spot post dinner, cinnamon bun waffle was incredible. A little steep on price but otherwise a great shop with delicious waffles!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with the gf for lunch before the Flames skill competition since it was close to the Dome.

Fairly full, but tables turned over fairly quickly. We ordered a HAM waffle and a Rueben waffle. You order at the counter and take a number, when your food is ready they will bring it to you. Meanwhile they have a shelf of board games if you want to kill time while waiting for your food. 

First off the waffles were fine. They were crispy and fluffy, but nothing that would warrant such a large price premium. The HAM was bland, needed to be drowned in the hot sauce. The Reuben was better, but for $9 you basically only get an appetizer. The idea of savory waffles are good, but waffle sandwiches would be way better. Charge a bit more and add another waffle along with more toppings so you have a sandwich and an actual meal. 

Overall the value wasn't there, nothing special other than the concept of a savory waffle."}
{"text":"Waffle was good. Personally I found the blueberries a little tart. Atmosphere is really relaxed; definitely different than most other breakfast places."}
{"text":"The guy at cash was very knowledgable and friendly. The waffle was good but I was still pretty hungry after. It was 9 dollars for the waffle I got which is pretty expensive considering you only get one waffle."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and awesome concept. 
I'm a waffle lover, such a simple thing is created to be beautiful and flavorful here. They have a great variety of different kinds of waffles to choose from, blueberry is my favorite! Always fresh. The freshly squeezed orange juice is to die for here. Great, friendly staff. They have different board games here to play if your interested in spending more time. Great little place, very modern, only down fall is the size of the place, when it's busy it's hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best waffles I've ever had.

Not just because the waffles themselves are light and delicious, but because they way they turn the base waffle into a delicious savory meal!

I had both the Reuben and Ham and cheese waffles, and both were superb! Think open-face sandwiches, with high-quality thinly sliced meat and delicious sauces, floating on top of a light, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside waffle, and your watering mouth will tell you that you need to go.

There are board games, a large assortment of interesting and artsy magazines, and very nice people running it.

So go already."}
{"text":"This place is run by the brother of the guy who owns Village Ice Cream and since I love Village so much we decided to come here for brunch but we were both pretty disappointed. You get a really tiny waffle for what you pay (you can see the size in my photo with utensils for scale). The waffle itself wasn't crispy at all and was relatively bland. The blueberries on top were nothing special and I'm not sure the white stuff they put on top added anything to the dish. The coffee was probably the best part of my meal and they get their coffee from somewhere else. Overall Buttermilk is kind of a let down and I wouldn't recommend going."}
{"text":"meeting my friends there around 11pm, not busy, no wait for table.

it's a nice place, but the waffle was just okay , nothing special and a bit disappointing actually (the place sold out everything when they opened, and needed to close the place for restocking)"}
{"text":"Awesome choices and amazing waffles! Love that they stay open a bit later and partnered with Village Ice Cream for one of their creations! Not too many seating options so it's hard to sit down if you come on a busy morning."}
{"text":"Date today- dec 30th.
My wife- I'd like the ginger-nog waffle and the peppermint hot chocolate waffle.
Host- we only have holiday waffles during December.
Wife- ummm... so are you saying you don't have them.
Host- nope.

Ummm wtf?  As far as most humans are concerned, dec 30th is still December... thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"The best day to come is Waffle Wednesday, when you can get 2 for 1 sweet waffles! The waffle was very fluffy but I would have liked it to be a bit crisper in texture. The toppings were the perfect amount, and there wasn't a sweetness overload. The takeout boxes and cutlery were all comparable which was very nice!"}
{"text":"So good!!! Everything that you've heard about how good buttermilk is true! Once you walk in and order the place is quirky and fun like it should be, once you order you find a table (if you can!) and then the waffles themselves don't take too long to come out and they taste fantastic."}
{"text":"Really good overpriced waffles. That is what sums this place up in a few words.

My wife has wanted to come here for a long time so we finally made a point of coming. At around 9:15 on Sunday there were a few tables taken but the place was mostly empty. 

The menu is small, but I think this is a good thing. They hit on a few really good combinations for their waffles and don't make it overwhelming to make a decision by trying to offer everything. What the menu is missing though is a \"sides\" option. When the menu says you get \"XYZ waffle\", that's it. You're just getting a waffle. No bacon or sausage, no little cup of fruit salad or some hashbrowns, not even a garnish. Now this idea is great if you're say meeting a friend for a cup of coffee and wanted to enjoy a waffle while you chat, just like how you would grab a doughnut at Timmy's. But if you're going out for brunch, then at $9+  for just a waffle with some toppings, you'e going to leave hungry. As I did and got Sausage McMuffin from McDonalds on my way home.

It was $30 for two waffles, a cup of tea, and a glass of orange juice. Way too expensive for me if I'm going to leave hungry."}
{"text":"Came here on a \"foodventure\" through Calgary and I was pretty unimpressed. Their waffle benedict was just kinda sad. Lack of hollandaise, over cooked yolk. For $15 you'd think they would at least poach an egg the REAL way. Not with a mold.

The location is good, cute looking atmosphere. But I wouldn't come here again. And if I ever did, I sure as hell wouldn't get the waffle benedict again."}
{"text":"I have given up on Buttermilk. Twice I've tried to go for breakfast and twice it's been closed. I was delighted when they announced they were finally opening at 7, but got here to find it opens at 8 now. I have to be at the office by 8:30! So here I am at Red's having a very nice breakfast. Your loss Buttermilk."}
{"text":"Perfect place for dessert! Was able to try one of the savory ones as well and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I remember I was sooooo excited when I saw signs of this place opening up. Being a mega fan of waffles, it was disappointing that Calgary didn't have a designated waffle cafe, UNTIL NOW. 

While they definitely had a rocky start on their first few days, I felt it might've left a couple of people disappointed and quick to judge. It took them a while to find their footing, but I felt like they were successful! If there's one thing Buttermilk knows how to do, they know how to make a damn good waffle. Soft and fluffy on the inside with a crisp exterior. They have their own creations of both sweet and savoury as well as a build your own waffle, in addition to their waffle of the month. I also like the presentation of the waffles being on a baking sheet. I usually stick to the flavours that I know and love, but I tried their lemon curd and goat cheese waffle and was really surprised as to how much I enjoyed it. My favourites however are their Village waffle as well as their Fruit waffle. 

The place itself is cute and trendy, with old school waffle irons and kitchen tools decorating the place. They host both movie nights on Monday, showcasing classic and popular movies, as well as a board game night on Wednesday. While I do think the board game night is great idea, I found that the movie nights were difficult for me as I was just not able to get comfortable on the hard chairs, so I've only done it once. A great thing about the events is that they're free and you're not obligated to buy a waffle if you don't want to, except I don't see why you wouldn't nor how would you be able to resist. 

The only downside of this place is that I find it to be a little overpriced. It's cheaper to get 2 waffles instead of a single, so either go with a date or go super hungry. While I love fresh orange juice, $4 for a small glass of warm juice is not worth it. 

Overall, I think it's a good stop for waffles and cute place for a quick meet up or date if you're in need of an idea."}
{"text":"Best waffles I have had in my life! Utterly soft and melt-in-mouth ! Just the right amount of sweet . We had the village -ice cream waffles and hands down the best ones ever! They also have movie screenings on some days and have really great coffee too!"}
{"text":"I visited Buttermilk a few days ago for the first time with a friend. My initial impressions upon walking in were that it's a warm and welcoming place. It's very casual in the sense that you need to order at the till then go take a seat and your food gets brought to your table. The staff were very friendly and were easily able to accommodate to my various food allergies. I love that they have board games at each table to keep you entertained while you wait for your waffles! The waffles themselves were quite enjoyable. My friend ordered the Rachel's Cinnamon Bun waffles and I ended up building my own! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried the lemon curd with goat cheese and cinnamon bun waffle. Both were good, however, unsure if they were worth $8 & $9. As tasty as it was, it's basically a waffle with special toppings.  Perhaps a specialization of the waffle batter itself would give this place an edge. Quinoa waffles? Coconut waffles? Green tea? Taro? Lavender? Maybe a filling in the centre? Feature waffle of the week? Plus all the cool toppings...would turn this place into a more creative and memorable experience. I'm always rooting for businesses to succeed, so will try this place a few more times to see how the menu evolves over time."}
{"text":"Parking3 out of 5
Service 2.5 out of 5 guy who brought the food out was the nicest
Food 3 out of 5 
Waffles are ok, not anything phenomenal. Very basic choices. Ham waffle didn't have much to it I added syrup to kick up the taste a little. Food would of been out sooner if they were a little more organized behind the counter when preparing waffles. Cashier could of be a little more friendly regardless of how busy the place is , would of made the wait a little more enjoyable ."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Buttermilk!  I really enjoy the sweet concoctions that they offer.  Some even include Village Ice Cream which is delightful! You order at the counter and your fresh waffle yumminess is delivered to the table.  Very kid friendly!"}
