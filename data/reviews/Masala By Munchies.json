{"text":"Was in the area for business and decided to check this place out.  Quality and quantity food for excellent prices.  Will come back next time I am in town and check out the biryani."}
{"text":"The owner was really friendly and I liked their thali deal.2 choices of meat + 1 veggie + naan or rice. I got butter chicken and naan with Chana masala. I thought their food was pretty good and the price was reasonable. The portions were good size and the naan was really good. I bought their gulab jamans and I would say that they were mediocre. Good place though but I would recommend take out.
Almost forgot to add that the beef samosas were really good too!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to break the bank, and get quality home cooked Pakistani food, you need to come to this place asap. I've recommended Masala by Munchies to several of my friends."}
{"text":"Time to update! I brought a few white people here to grab some take out the other day, and we loved it!

We got :

1. Veggie and Beef Samosas!! So good. They were clearly home made. Everything inside was fresh too. Super greasy, but they're samosas!

2. Butter Chicken - some of the best I've had recently! So good, with lots and lots of big chunks of chicken! Not too sweet, and perfectly creamy!

3. Chana Masala - OUR FAVOURITE CURRY ACTUALLY. So good, not at all what I was expecting. 

4. Achari Aloo - THis was just okay. I was expecting a lot less gravy and just more potato, but still good!

5. Garlic Naans - HUGE AS HELL. Three of us shared, and there was still some leftover!

6. Chicken Biryani - Fresh and delicious, as per biryani fare!


Will defo be coming back to grab take out from here, so glad that there's a decent indian place near my home in north RH!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and was anxious for something different for lunch.

Ahhh Pakistani will do the trick!

I knew of one in the plaza at the NW corner of Major Mac and Elgin Mills.

Well sure enough it didn't  take long to have the take out bag filled with a Thali, Rice and Naan all for a reasonable $11 with tax (maybe Tip too)

They offer a varied selection of Biryani Rices and items the previous reviewer outlined.

I went with the Thali as it offers 2 meat dishes and 4 veggie dishes plus I opted for the Chicken Biryani rice and a Naan

The mutton was delicious with several pieces of osso buco that one can enjoy the inner bone marrow

The chicken was surprisingly not that spicy and was chunks of tender thigh and breast meat

The 4 veggies I chose were eggplant, spinach, curry lentils, and cholay

Naan was cooked in the Tandoori

It was a generous portion and I had some leftover veggies and rice to add to my dinner later

This is mainly a take out place as its not anything fancy but the owner is proud of his cooking and the quality of his food. That home made quality is what I want because after eating for almost a week on business with clients in those places where every hostess and server wears black and its the same factory food menu, I need something real.

This is real food, cooked slow, with care in Vaughan. This place will be even busier once the EMS, cops and Fire guys catch on.

The food was less spicier than I expected.

The previous owner here was Karibu"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp again for helping me find this gem. This place is literally a hole in the wall. It is a family run business. They have a few tables to sit down and eat but it is more of a take out place (they just have counter service). When I came in at around 2:30 pm on a Sunday the place was very crowded.
Service was a bit disorganized as there wasn't a proper queue, people were just cutting in to the line, which is not the owner's fault I guess. 

Lets talk about food.
Chicken Biryani ($6) - absolutely delicious! It was very flavourful and had just the right amount of spice. There was plenty of chicken (all bone-in scrumptious dark meat!) unlike Biryani King which only gives two pieces. 

They have some weekday specials like $1 Naan on Thursday, $4 Chicken Biryani on Wednesdays and $9 Thali everyday. All prices exclude tax. All in all a great place to get cheap, good quality homemade food. 

Oh, and they seem to have some dessert options as well. Like Anita B., I also saw some jalebis and they have halwa puri on their menu. They also offer catering. I will be back to try more food here especially the thali since it sounds like a great deal!"}
{"text":"Oh man, best kebabs out there without a doubt. Owners are really friendly and you can ask them questions if unsure of what to get. For the price you pay, you get a ton of food. This is an added bonus to the fact that the food is amazing. My friend and I often pick up food from here. While we wait, we get the Bhel Puri. Honestly, this very simple dish is taken to another level at this restauran! So good. Food is fresh, packed tight and service amazing."}
{"text":"Drove by this place this past Saturday and it has been replaced by some other restaurant. Masala by Munchies is closed."}
{"text":"this place is awesome, if your looking for cheap pakistani food.  The biriyani is excellent (dark meat only booooo).  The beef samosas are some of the best you'll find. The beef kebabs are really good, but maybe a touch over spiced."}
{"text":"Good food. Dive. Don't dine in. Get Take Out. Watch out for Daily Specials. Great value. Delicious. Lingering food if you know what i mean."}
