{"text":"I have been to Steak on a Stone three times within the past two months.  As odd as it sounds, the reason to go is not for the food, but for the experience.  Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent, but concept of cooking your own steak in front of you is what sets this place apart from other steakhouses, earning \"5 stars.\"

The restaurant is located in a dark strip mall, and does not look very exciting or appealing from the outside.  Once inside, the décor appears to be somewhat outdated, but I did not get a negative feeling from it.  The dining room is chilly when you first sit down, but there is a reason for that.  It heats up pretty quick once you start cooking your perfect steak.  The staff was friendly and understanding of our two friends who had never been there.  They explain their menu and the cooking process very well.

They offer a full menu, but you are truly missing out if you get anything other than the stone entrée.  They bring out a 750 degree stone with a raw steak (or chicken, shrimp, etc.) on it.  You get to cook it as rare or as well done as you please.   The idea is that you cut small pieces and cook each piece individually, that way your food is always hot.  If you are a slow eater, you may need to cook some of your steak first before eating it or risk having it overdone.  Since I eat quickly, I never have that problem, and I like my steak medium rare.

Also, you have to get the Saganaki as an appetizer.  The Kasseri cheese is brought out to the table by the server.  Without warning she lights that bad boy on fire and suddenly a rush of flames come hurling towards you as the server screams, \"Opa!\"  You don't even realize that your eyebrows may be singed as you experience the melted goodness in your mouth.  Certainly a surprise if you don't know what's coming.

Overall, this place is great.  The combination of the food and the experience earn this restaurant a look."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with my visit to Steak on a Stone. While the renovated building did have some neat features (high ceilings and open cathedral like spaces) I was left in want. Service was lack luster and the wait for a uncooked steak was unreasonably long. I enjoy the almost caveman concept of cooking on a rock, but somehow the mark was missed. My only praise goes to the quality of the cuts of meat. The marbling and tenderness of the fillet I had was great, but nonetheless expected from such a cut."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, my family and I just love the food here along with the atmosphere.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Usually restaurants that have a gimmick are not that good. Steak on a Stone is not an exception. No one in my group enjoyed their meal. The staff was not very friendly or attentive. We felt like we were being rushed. You can find a lot better for less."}
{"text":"If I could have one dinner to rethink, I would not have picked to come here. I only give one star because it won't let me do no stars.
We had reservations, showed up 10 minutes early and we were sat 10 late. 
When we ordered our food we were told there weren't enough stones.. So we had to wait even longer. 
It was definitely an experience. Just one I never want to have again. The service was one of the worst instances of my dining history."}
{"text":"The overall experience of this place is very good.  Decoration of this place is so so.  The special about this place is you can cook your own steak on a stone and the way you like it.  I don't suggest everyone to dress up very nice because the smell of cooking the steak will STICK with you until you got home change your clothes and take a bath / shower."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, great service, menu is way to big and too many things to chose from which I sometimes find too time consuming however the biggest disappointment is their go food quality. I went there years ago when they first opened and it wasn't that bad however for my second time there nothing was prepared right. Bread had too much garlic salt on it, Cesar salad had a non cesar type dressing, steak was overly salted and it kept sticking to the stone. We had potato skins as an appetizer and the cheese on  It resembled cheese whiz. 
Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The only person who should be going there is Robert Irwin from restaurant impossible"}
{"text":"Disappointing, to say the least.  My family and I decided to try Steak on a Stone because we've never been there before, and we all love steak. So it seemed like a natural fit. I could leave a long winded review, but I'll just go straight to the pros and cons.

Pros: The hostess and wait staff were very friendly and courteous. That's it.

Cons: The food. First, the salad  reminded me of something they would serve in a high school cafeteria. With wilted lettuce, and big tomato wedges. No big deal, we were here for the steak after all. After they went through the spiel of how the steak was cooked, I surprised to find out that  I would be the one doing the cooking. If I would've known that, I would've  just stayed home and done it myself.

So they bring out our meal and the first thing I notice is the green beans. Again, total cafeteria food, straight from a can. The baked potato was alright, though it's hard to screw that up. So when the steak comes out, it's doing it's thing, cooking on the stone. So I'm waiting and waiting and waiting, Flipping it over on the stone trying to cook this thing. The stone just didn't stay hot enough to cook the steak on both sides. So I ended up with it cooked on only one side. I even tried to butterfly it but to no avail.

This place turned out to be a big waste of time and money. Like I said, if you want a good steak you have to cook yourself. Stay home."}
{"text":"I feel I was misled for some time about this place. I always felt it was upscale and out of my price range. However, I am wrong, wrong, oh-so-wrong. Steak On A Stone, as far as the Montrose based restaurant is concerned, made me sad. We entered into what can only be described as \"a formerly nice Elk's Lodge\" and walked through the very empty dining room to a secluded area and were seated next to the drink machine. All the room in the world and we got to listen to the hum of an air compressor. But wait, there's so much more.

Everything was dirty and in some kind of disrepair. It had that look of \"ok from far away\", but upon closer inspection, the carpet hadn't been vacuumed for cleaned in some time, the walls were scuffed and dingy, the windows needed some serious scrubbing, and whatever I touched had a slightly tacky film.
 
We sat down and had to send all of our silverware back. Dirty utensils wrapped in napkins. Hooray.

At this point, it seems impossible to understand how they could receive a 2 star rating, but at the very least, the food was inexpensive, at lunch, that is, for the food we ate.
 
You get to choose your own very appropriately sized meat. I appreciate a decent cut of beef over quantity any day. There was a long list of options for dipping sauces. It reminded me of hibachi in self-serve style. The dipping sauces for the meat all tasted bland, though. The meat was better by itself. If anything, Steak On A Stone should focus on pushing how good their cuts of meat are. They are far better looking and tasting than the chain places across the street (such as Outback). 

The sides were not bad or good. I tried the rice and the regular mashed potatoes. I sort of wish the menu had been better thought out. The suggested sides are unoriginal and really don't match the food or concept of the restaurant. Speaking of which, the concept they are going for seems to fall short of the experience I feel I was promised. With a little effort, I'm sure this place could do better. But everything had the feel of half-assed and apathy. I can deal with cooking my own food and paying to do so. But a more cohesive and patron friendly experience would actually do wonders for this place.
 
In the end, at lunch time, for 4 people with drinks, entrees and a dessert per person, with a 25% tip, the meal was under 100. For a steak lunch, that's worth 2 stars. I won't be coming back or recommending this place, and I know this wasn't just \"a bad day\" for them. 

You could have done so much better guys."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.  The seating is a little spaced out, but it makes for a very intimate little atmosphere... very easy to talk to whomever you are eating with.  The food was very good, but I have to say I was really kind of freaked out by the stone.  Half the time I was afraid I was going to burn myself while I was eating.  It was a great experience and I will probably come back at some point, but the concept of cooking my own meat on a ridiculously hot stone right in front of me... well, it just was a little more stressful than I was bargaining for when I pictured a relaxing dinner out.  To be fair though, it is a really fun concept, the food really was excellent and the staff quite personable.  If I could give a 4 1/2 I would!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant three stars for the concept and atmosphere of the restaurant.  I'll admit that it was kind of a cool cooking method to have your steaks cooked on stones in front of you, however, the food is not that great.  If my bill is going to be $60 for two diners with no drinks, I'd expect steak at least comparable to that of Texas Roadhouse, but this wasn't even close.  Nothing there tickled my fancy very much.

Save yourself some cash and head over to a different steak chain."}
{"text":"First I want to say... the novel idea of cooking on a stone seemed fun! We sadly chose this establishment for my and my 7 month pregnant wife's anniversary. The food wasn't bad.. when we finally got it. We got their early for our reservation and were greeted by what seemed like a very stressed host, so sat at the bar and had a drink. Ambiance is just ok nothing what you would expect for the final bill.  The bartenders were friendly and helpful. (little did we know they would be the only ones)  We actually were sat 15 minutes early, and thought how awesome that was. As she walked us to our seats I noticed at least 10 to 15 empty tables, got me thinking...  Well we sat for almost half an hour till anyone even acknowledged us. Two couples were sat after us and I watched as they were both helped before us. Finally the girl that sat us in the first place asked if we had a server yet, and we both said no. No offer of drinks... nothing. Then 10 minutes later one of the bartenders comes by and ask if we have a server, and again we say no. No offer of drinks again and just \"we will find you one\".  FINALLY about 35 to 40 minutes into this a server comes over. He was friendly and I was thinking, they must have given us one of their best. WRONG! The water they serve is substandard... really horrible. We ordered starters. I must say they were pretty dang good. We ordered our drinks. It took 15 to 20 minutes to get my simple rum and coke to me. It took them another 25 minutes to bring our food, which didn't make sense to me. You figure its a raw steak, what could take so long?? Well, then I was never given one of my sides that I paid extra for. I also order sauteed mushrooms and onions (which by the way they charge separately for) and they never came. My wife finished her drink and they never came back to give her another. It was the worst service I have ever gotten of anywhere I have eaten... that is saying a lot, since I was military and lived all over the country.  The bill was over 70.00 dollars and I will say the worst 70.00 I have ever spent. I was laughing as were driving off, thinking how we could have eaten at near by burger king and gotten better service. This place could be amazing... it obviously has the wrong management and training structure. The only thing this place is good for is having drinks and appetizers at the bar... that way you don't have to deal with any of the obviously badly run and mismanaged staff and timing.  Well that is my rant. Never again will I go here and I will definitely never recommend it to anybody. Horrible place."}
{"text":"Came here last week. Only 4 tables had customers.we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We laughed and left. The hostess is the worst.she whispers when she talks and even rolled her eyes at the customer in front of us. We are here tonight for 2 reasons. #1 we have a gift card #2 Valentines day. So here is were this place went wrong. GREAT CONCEPTS need a good team to succeed. That is missing. The brothers owner got sick and is no longer here. HUGE MISSING LINK. 2 i heard that the Steak on the Stone concept is being shut down soon and it will be a sports bar. Very reliable source. So I believe since this decision was made. THEY JUST DONT CARE ANYMORE. Its a shame.i know the owner worked his ass off to make this place work. It was kinda fun while it lasted..on a final note. Even the product has gone down hill a little. So maybe it is time to make it a sports bar. So sad to see it go."}
{"text":"Steak on a Stone takes itself way too seriously, and under delivers drastically. First off, we call to make reservations at 6:45 for 4. Pretty smooth, first open reservation is for 7:45. The man on the phone made it sound like it was a very busy night. That was expected. We arrive 5 minutes early and are told to we need to wait. Ok sure, we're early. But wait, what is this? There are approximately 6-8 tables open. Not including the tables they have pushed together to seat 8-10 people. I'm thinking \"Ok, this is strange. Why would they not seat us at one of those? Must be reserved.\" Meanwhile 4-5 more parties of guests arrive. They are told the wait will be 45 minutes! Some stay and some leave. At this point I am really thinking we picked the wrong place to dine this evening.

Finally we are seated, promptly at 7:45. Great. Our server comes over, takes drink orders and explains the menu (which is unnecessarily huge by the way) and leaves. He comes back quickly with our drinks and takes our food order saying he'll be right back out with some bread and our salads. 15 minutes pass, finally he is back with bread and 2 of the 3 salads. He puts them down and leaves before I can get his attention telling him he forgot mine. After another 7 or so minutes I spot him again and tell him what he forgot. He apologizes and brings it out quickly. Before leaving the table again he says are food will be right out. I cram the side salad down just in time for our food to arrive. Food was ok, nothing spectacular. By the end of the meal one of my friends realizes he never got his baked potato. We ask the waiter he apologizes again, blaming it on his handwriting which I thought was strange. He brings the potato out and we finish dinner. Check comes, plates are cleared and our waiter disappears for another 10 minutes before coming back to get the check. We pay and leave.

All said I was throughly unimpressed. Steak on a Stone wants to be an upscale restaurant so bad but just can't do it. The dining room is dirty and over lit. The windowed area is even worse, and the soda fountains being there don't help much either.

My advice to the owners, get rid of your management. Hire competent waitstaff, clean up, turn down the dining room lights and get rid of most of your menu. Stick with the namesake steak on a stone and a few other dishes. Also, don't take yourself so seriously. Just because you want to have an upscale restaurant it doesn't mean that it is one.

Skip this one for sure."}
{"text":"I have never done their steak on a stone. I heard about this new concept back when they were called Kristofer's. I always wanted to try it, just haven't got around to it yet. 

This review is based solely on their buffet service. Their buffet is served around brunch time on Sundays (call first). This place is great for a large group, especially on the holidays. I have come many of times on Orthodox Easter. 

So much more than your typical buffet. It's not about the quantity here, its all about the quality. Savory, stick to your ribs, comfort foods, with a Greek influence. I mean, whoever is in this kitchen IS Greek, obvi. The best thing by far is the lamb shank, it's tender, meaty and seasoned how I like (not all those crazy spices that my grandma doesn't use). 

If you like Greek food, they have some of the best in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The steak is delicious and the green beans are amazing!  Pretty yummy french fries as well.  I usually take big groups here for work functions and everyone always loves the experience.  The waitstaff and management have always been very accommodating.  Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"3.8 stars....

Great concept. Great steak. Good service (not great, however).

The atmosphere and decorating could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Ok, so you know that Gordon Ramsay show, \"Kitchen Nightmares\"? Gordon comes to a struggling restaurant and gives them an update, facelift, revision to make them successful. This place has a lot of good things going for it, but I think Steak on a Stone is its own worst enemy.

The dining room decor is ok... it feels a little dated even though I know this place is somewhat newish. Maybe it was the time of day (6:00pm on a weekday) but it felt too cavernous and empty. Something a little more hip, a little more intimate would have felt like a better dining experience.

People on here seem to have beef (har har) with the fact you cook your steak on a stone. See title of restaurant. I thought this was great, and I did get a different flavor experience by quickly cooking each bite on a lava rock. It made me slow down and enjoy my dinner. I also like the fact that you can choose from a variety of interesting dipping sauces. Way to go, SOAS!

Okay, so ... good concept with the steak and sauces, so WHY IS THERE ALSO A GIANT GREEK MENU? If Gordon has taught me anything about running a restaurant, it's that you need to keep your menu small and stay true to the concept. It's like this place had a couple of partners who couldn't agree on the menu and one of them wanted to have a full greek menu or else he wasn't going to invest. I dunno why anyone would do this. Open a second restaurant. It seems super strange and I'm sure it isn't cheap to continue to stock those ingredients. Stick with your niche. 

Lastly, two little minor details that bugged me:
(1) The butter came in plastic peel-off lid pats. Everything about this place is trying to be \"classy\" but then the butter comes off in peel-a-pat. This isn't Bob Evans, especially not what you're charging for a steak. Simply chilling some butter balls in a bowl would elevate the experience.
(2) It smells really strange when you first walk in. It's just the smell of burnt fat from cooking steak on those lava rocks... and though it is tasty, the general smell in the restaurant isn't appealing or appetite-inducing. Maybe it's the mix with the greek food, I don't know."}
{"text":"Love this place! My hubby loves to come when we want some tasty food, served fast.  The lemon soup is his favorite, and I love to cook my own shrimp. I love that it's never super crowded, and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Quality food and unique concept. First time in my life the last bite of my filet was just as warm as the first! Resist the urge to touch the stone."}
{"text":"I liked it here. 

We were driving from Solon to Canton Airport on a Thursday afternoon looking for somewhere DIFFERENT to eat. Usually along the highway there are chains and chains of the same ol big named restaurants..... needless to say when we say Steak on a Stone, we thought.. what the heck??? And decided to give it a try. 

A very unassuming interior, and probably even a more plain exterior doesn't scream \"try me\", but i am glad we did. That usu sally happens when you open a place into an already established building, you don't get to put your own 'stamp' on it. 

We sat over by the windows and there really aren't a lot of views being right off of I-77.. but we were hear to EAT, so let me get to the important part. 

For an Appetizer we had Saginaki - a Kasseri cheese that they saute and flambeed at your table. Very cool. Guy almost caught his hair on fire getting alittle too close... but the cheese you spread on break.. and it was OH SO GOOD. 

So the theme of the place is that you cook your own food, on your own little 'stone' that is heated at a temperature in excess of 750degrees.. We both got steak and mashed potatoes... oh, and in case you don't think when faced with Delicious food.. DONT TOUCH THE STONE. So, we were able to cut up our almost rare steak into pieces and cook those pieces as long as you want.. medium, well, etc. They also have Scallops, Port Tenderloin, Chicken.. Lamb Chops... 

When making a selection you get to choose from 2 sauces.. from house steak sauce to Lemon Garlic Oil, or Jack Daniels and Mind Jelly.. or plain ol' melted butter... they have about 12 to choose from. I liked the House Steak Sauces just fine. 

The mashed potatoes were good, i like when they leave the skins on them and mash them a bit lumpy. 

We liked what we tried for what the theme is. There have pasta and other things for those who aren't into it. I am glad we came... This is a good lunch place, i think we paid about $20 total per person with a drink and our appetizer... so not too bad. Thumbs up from me and my travel companion..."}
{"text":"They bring you a brick-sized chunk of lava, at a blistering 750 degrees, with a scattering of salt.  On it: a steak.  

You cut it up, and you're in for the busiest meal of your life.  Because maybe you've eaten at The Melting Pot, but that shit is training wheels.  It doesn't matter how long you leave some bit of chicken bobbing in that heated broth; you can't overcook it.  Sure, have a leisurely conversation, go to the bathroom, run for President - by the time you get back, that chicken's just perfect and moist. 

Whereas that stone?  It's like they dropped the heart of the sun onto your plate.  You put a chunk of meat on that sticky, sizzling brick, make some amusing bon mot to your companion, and by the time you get back it's this leathery strip of burned protein, curled up at the edges like a dead spider.  

So you must COOK!  COOK FOR YOUR LIFE!  There is no time to waste, you laggard flaneur!  Put the piece of meat on the supernova, tug its seared flesh off, flip it over, and perhaps - PERHAPS - you might have a piece of meat called, laughingly, medium-rare.  

Do you choose to drink?  Do it between bites, you thirsty slacker.  Jack Bauer is yelling \"THERE'S NO TIME!\" in your ear.  The meat!  The meat is becoming coal!  Speed up!  EAT!  COOK!  LIVE!

Oh, Steak on a Stone, you are so living on the edge.  

Steak on a Stone is a place of mystery.  Why do they give you such aggressive sauces to dip your steak in when the meat is perfectly good on its own?  Why is there a full-out greek menu along with the steak on that stone?  Why are there two grammatical errors proudly displayed on the cover of the menu?  How many third-degree burns do people incur here in the course of a month?  

People say the atmosphere of Steak on a Stone is a little run-down.  It is not.  If you recognize Steak on a Stone what it is, which is essentially a Chuck-E-Cheese for grownups.  Is it overpriced?  Yes.  Is it a little saturated with, shall we say, the frommage?  It is.  

Is it fun as all hell when your waiter sends a fireball into the air, yells \"OPA!\" and plunks a plateful of burning cheese down on your table?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  

You will be occupied during the meal.  Maybe you were foolish enough to think that at a restaurant, people are supposed to cook for you. No.  Here, you will toil upon the salted bricks, slicing and maneuvering and deftly avoiding permanent scarring from the nuclear furnace sitting directly over your lap, AND YOU WILL LEARN TO LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good, a little over done, but not uneatable. The service left much to be desired! I would not return nor recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"How long does it take to make potatoes?  We waited close to 45 mins for our food and all they brought us cooked was the potatoes and they weren't cooked all the way.   If your cooking your meat in front of you, than why so long for side dishes?  We got the greek potatoes and we each got 4 small potatoe wedges!  very disappointing.  my husband got the ribeye which was large, and I got 5 shrimps for the shrimp meal. I left extremely hungry and after paying over $50 for the both of us, I should be stuffed.  Our waiter would walk over to our table and walk away without saying a word.  No drink refills and we had to get our own silverware from the table next to us. The worst part is you leave smelling like meat and smoke.   Do yourself a favor and go to Longhorn or Outback a few doors down."}
{"text":"Not bad for a steak place was a little pricey but no complaints"}
{"text":"Restaurant itself looks pretty nice inside.  Not very decorative and fancy.  Definately more of a family restaurant feel.  

Started off with calamari which was okay, the batter was very light but they gave us a lot of calamari.  

So, then for the entree...
I ordered a NY strip.  The cut was pretty good I thought.   I just dont like the fact that I have to cook my own food on a stone that is 700 degrees in front of me.  There was constantly steam coming up into my face.  I felt rushed to eat my steak because it was cooking!!! 

I thought it was a little pricey too ($23 for my 12 oz ny strip).  Beer selection is pretty weak.  

Unless you really want the experience of cooking your own steak on a hot stone, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here with the family for lunch at 2:30 on a Saturday, and there were 4 other tables that were occupied.  The presentation was the biggest disappointment.  We walked in and the wait-staff were standing around in the dining area (an unoccupied area) joking and cussing.  First turn-off.  Second was the menu.  It was cheaply made and laminated.  It was not organized, and not easy to understand.  The waiter that helped us was not overly friendly, and I felt like he was going to expect a small tip from us. He has been with the restaurant around 3 months, and wasn't very helpful.  Probably not trained well, and did not have personality of a good waiter.  The food, however, was very good.  The hummus plate had an abundance of hummus, and the grape leaves were the best I have ever had.  The steak came out on a 750 degree stone, and had an excellent flavor.  The sauces were not good, and we're not necessary.  The sides (the whole family got different sides) were ok, just not great.  Except for the Mac and cheese.  The kids said that was the best they have ever had.  Overall, I felt that the restaurant was disorganized and dirty, but the steaks were very very good.  I am not sure if I will go back.  Oh, and there are no lunch specials for anything on the stones.  4 people plus tip came to just under $100."}
{"text":"You cook your own food on a very hot stone slab here. Once the novelty wears off you may realize this isn't so great. I go out to eat because I don't feel like cooking.  The food isn't bad but it certainly is not worth the price."}
{"text":"This is the most overpriced restaurant you have ever been to. Don't waste your time, just go Outback for better food and service, or Hyde Park if you want something nicer. The service here wasn't very good either. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Uggh.

My instincts always tell me to stay away from chains. Especially chains with a silly gimmick like this one. But yeah, I decided to listen to someone (or a few someones) about checking this place out. I don't even really LIKE steak. And I especially didn't like it here. 

I will say, service was great. Nothing wrong in that department. Our server was such a nice, personable girl. I feel bad that she's working in such a shitty chain.

The ambiance was terrible. There wasn't any. It had a Hometown Buffet or Ponderosa type of feel. Or shit, hospital frickin' cafeteria kinda feel. Whatever. It sucked. Had the ambiance been better I think I would have enjoyed it a tiny bit more.

The food was not good. 

When you leave, you smell bad. Really bad. From all of that gross steak scented steam that emanates from the stone you're cooking your own damn steak on.

Cook that shizz in the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"OK, I know this sounds stupid, but I went for fish fry at Steak on a Stone. Right off the bat, I know it was a bad idea, it wasn't my choice, but that's what was chosen so there you go. 

Needless to say, they are not known for their fish fry. Also the smell of meat was a little over whelming even for this lover of all things that once walked. And the next time I did laundry I was like, holy smokes! My pink sweater smelled like a delicious beef jerky! 

With that said, the decor is kind of boring and non-descript. The mildly gimmicky lava stone with raw meat on it looks cool. I kept thinking what a disaster the place would be for kids. I can just imagine a toddler reaching out to touch the pretty stone making noise and unwittingly burning off their fingers to little stumps. 

I've heard the meat is delicious, it's good for groups, the meat seemed pricey for having to cook it yourself... I always find that annoying. But all in all,  I'll try it again sometime, for the meat.  And the jerky sweater bonus."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED! It was pretty good too...shame it couldn't make it!"}
{"text":"A small quaint place, the steaks are hands down the best steaks around! Love the idea of cooking my own steak one bite at a time on the 700 degree lava stone! Each piece perfectly cooked and hot and juicy from start to finish!"}
{"text":"We were impressed!  Steak on a Stone was recommended to a fellow worker and me as a fun place to take a customer.  It seemed kind of gimmicky, and there's manual labor involved on your part since you pretty much cook your own steak... but we loved it.

Some other Yelpers mention the dismal interior, and I will agree that the lobby area is dated.  But we were seated in the airy side room, and it appeared clean and bright in there.

I arrived early and had an excellent dirty martini (plus teeny tiny blue cheese stuffed olives) in the bar.

We started with three appetizers - Saganaki, crabcakes and sauteed scallops.  The flaming cheese was the best of the apps.  Both the others were on the small side, and I wouldn't recommend them.

I went with the 8oz filet, adding on 1/4lb of shrimp.  This came with my choice of two sides (salad with Ranch and steamed broccoli) and two sauces (Bernaise and Creamy Garlic).  Your meal is brought to the table as a raw hunk of beef and a single shrimp sitting on your own personal hot lava rock.  The waiter turns the meats and presents the stone to you.  You will then carve off individual slices of the meat and press each side on the stone for a couple seconds, dunk in sauce and eat.

What I particularly liked about this way of cooking is that the stone sears the meat and won't cook it beyond about 1/4\" thickness.  So, you can chat it up with the rest of your party for 20 minutes or more, and you'll still have perfect steak when you're ready to dive in.

Now, I didn't pay for my meal... and it is a pricey place (my steak and shrimp ran $34), but I would go on my own dime.  Heck, I'm already thinking about how Ken and I can roadtrip to the North Olmstead, OH one since its a tad closer to home!"}
{"text":"Not bad, I must say.  Steak on a Stone is a steakhouse with some subtle Greek undertones.  The idea is a gimmick: you cook the steak (or lamb, duck, or whatever) yourself right in front of you on a pre-heated stone.  It's like Benihana without the cooks with hilariously stereotypical Japanese accents and tea-flavored ice cream.  The steaks themselves were quality steaks - maybe a little bit on the small and expensive side, but nevertheless good.  The sides and sauces were also good, and were all made from scratch.  The most noteworthy thing (other than the stone itself) was the garlic butter served with the bread.

I liked the interior.  There was a bar at the front, as well as a large lobby with fans that presumably had stone blades.  The place was clean and tidy.

Best of all, they had Christmas Ale on tap.  After three or four of those, I would be drunk enough to take my drunken talents to LeBron's old mansion across Medina Rd.  The fact that in May, a restaurant still had a Christmas beer on tap made me very happy like a little schoolgirl.  Except giving beer to a schoolgirl is equally illegal and creepy.

This is a place to splurge.  If you can afford this place on a regular basis, good for you.  Go screw yourself."}
{"text":"Had really high hopes for this place.  I should have read the yelp reviews before going as they are pretty right on.  The menu is huge, reminds me a of a Greek diner.  The steak on the stone was just good but I didn't really dig cooking it myself.  The fried portabello mushroom appetizer was one small mushroom top, sliced and fried for 6.50.  My associates would give the place 3 stars and I could be convinced they were a 3.  I won't be returning to this restaurant,  I could get just as good a steak for the money and have someone else cook it for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last weekend. The service was great. We had a really good cheese on a stone and bread appetizer. However, the steak on a stone was just so-so ... frankly, it was a lot of work for a minimal payoff. I guess I'd rather have someone else cook my steak for me rather than having to do it myself at the table on a 750 degree stone."}
{"text":"Cool place but not my taste of food. Maybe if I had a steak on a stone maybe better idk. Had the chicken parm.  wasn't very good the decor is really cool but that's about it. Service was a little slow. When we got there we were told be a 30min wait ok not bad but when we got seated it wasn't full. So don't know what the deal was there. Then our server didn't seem to even want to be there. So all in all not a big fan."}
{"text":"We were out celebrating the 4th of July and decided to stop in to Steak on a Stone for our first visit.  As we pulled into the parking lot, we had to zigzag through the maze of pot holes in the pavement...not little holes either.  This should have been our first clue as to the philosophy of the owners to put money back into the business for upkeep.

We walked into the foyer and noticed that the baseboards were beat to heck and there was peeling paint on the bottom of the walls.  It looked really bad and was not a good first impression of the inside of the building.

Then we opened the door to the restaurant itself and were hit with the smell...and not a good smell.  I would expect a steak house to smell like steak.  This smell was foul.  It smelled like old fish.  Since there were very few people there, the hostess greeted us immediately and began to walk us to a booth along the back wall.  This gave us a chance to walk across the whole carpeted floor.  We both had on tennis shoes and our feet stuck to carpeted floor the entire way.  Do you have any idea how much skank you have to have on carpet to make your feet stick to it?

We sat down and didn't even look at the menu.  We both just said to each other \"I can't eat here.\"  We got up and left.  On the way out, I did tell the front desk that the establishment had a really bad odor and that our feet stuck to the floor.

If what we saw is any indication of how they maintain the \"public space\", I hate to see what the kitchen looks like.

If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.

My recommendation to the owners:  spend some money and clean that place from top to bottom."}
{"text":"My word, this place is both interesting and delicious.  The main concept is that you cook your own steak on a 750 degree stone right there on your table as you eat it.  My friends and I love unique ideas like this so we decided to try it out.

They have other items besides the \"stone\" menu, but that would defeat the whole purpose of going.  I ordered a 12oz ribeye with salad and baked potato.  After a quick salad, out comes our waitress pushing a cart with our meals.  Sure enough, there was a raw slab of steak on a stone!  She gave us our instructions: don't move the steak or you'll ruin the searing (causing it to cook faster than planned) and to cut off little strips to cook individually.  

We also had our choice of two dipping sauces for the steak.  I went with creamy garlic and Jack Daniels.  Both were delicious and our party didn't have any regrets about their various sauce choices either.

The service was quite nice and helpful, a must for such a different dining experience!

My only note of warning is don't wear your fancy best clothes.  There's pretty much no way to avoid some splattering from cooking a steak right in front of you.

I can't wait to go back, it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Food okay.  Bad service!!!  Not worth the money.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is exactly as it advertises:  You order your cut of meat, they bring it on a stone.  It's pretty simple, really.

That said, my husband and kids pick this place as their \"go to\" celebration restaurant.  The \"flaming cheese\" (aka saganaki) is delicious and fun for older kids to watch, the cuts of steak are delicious, and the service is OK.  I've noticed that it's been a little inconsistent lately, but from what I'm reading on Yelp it may be a management issue (turnover).  

One thing that contributed to a 4-star review instead of a 5 is their inconsistent application of the \"rules\".  My daughter is a very small kid, and she's 9 1/2.  She's been traveling and eating at excellent restaurants around the country since she was 6 months old (she has her own frequent flier account).  The first time she went, she was able to cook her own steak.  The second time, I could order her a steak but had to cook it for her.  The third time, she was able to cook her own.  This most recent time, she wasn't allowed to have her own steak at all.  The server mumbled something about the owner being there - and I assume that was the angry middle-aged scowling man that was skulking around.  I reassured the server that my daughter has made her own steak there before, and that I would assume all responsibility for supervising her, but he wouldn't budge.  Rather than cause a scene and ruin dinner, I just said \"never mind\", ordered the next size larger steak for myself, and let her cook to her little heart's content.

I agree with the reviews that say that the restaurant is trying really hard (and failing) at being upscale.  I've eaten at several upscale steakhouses, and this isn't in the same ballpark.  Rather than try to be something it's not, SOAS should accept the fact that they're not a Morton's or Yachtsman and embrace what they really are.

Bottom line:  Delicious saganaki.  Great cuts of meat.  OK sides.  Cook it yourself, or they'll cook it for you.  Your choice.   Could use some service / decor improvements."}
{"text":"Ok... My favorite steak place! The prices are a bit high, but it's a very fun concept with great tasting steaks. They bring you a rare steak on top of a 700 degree lava stone. They flip the steak once and give you the plate. You cut and cook the steak a piece at a time to your desired wellness. All the sides are great too. I also recommend the lemon square desert!! I go here once per year with friends and we have a great time!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to a different Steak on a Stone (in Montrose) and love it there! We decided to give the restaurant in Willoughby a try and I was surprised at how bland everything tasted. It was a total shock!! The steaks, which are usually great, were OK at best. The broccoli was bland (even though it looked like there was a lot of butter). My son ordered the alfredo sauce and even it was bland.

Because we love the Montrose location so much, we will give this one a try one more time, but if it doesn't live up to the expectations (especially due to the cost), we won't be back to the Willoughby one."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I dig the concept - Pick your cut of steak (or other grill-able meats/seafoods) and cook it to your specification on a personal rock that they serve it on at your table. when this place first opened, I was really all about, but lately, it's diner beware. 

For instance: The last time I ventured out to this pace for lunch, I ordered a strip and two sides (one was the Avgolemeno which was tasty) but I found myself sawing the crap out of that steak to get a piece free to cook on my rock. At first I assumed dull knife, but then I took a bite and struggled to chew. It was the second tough cut of beef I'd had there and it wasn't pleasant.

In past visits I've tried the shrimp on the stone which was decent, but also a few of their Greek entres. All of them were average. If it weren't for the lack of Saganaki and Avgolemeno in Akron, I may not be tempted to return.

If you're looking for a new experience or just feeling like an out of the ordinary dining experience, give this place a try or two. Being so close to this restaurant, I can say that it will be pretty easy for me to drive a little ways past for a meal that's a notch or two up."}
{"text":"Wow, I am very shocked at the reviews for this place and seem to see a common trend in them which blows my mind. Ok so I get people hate the idea of cooking their own food and feel that when going to a restaurant you should not have too!

However I have to say this place was rock or I should say stone solid!

I wish this place was open in California and better yet near or in the San Francisco Bay Area! What a cool concept and great eat eats. So here is how it all works people...

This is your typical steak place offering you several cuts of steak and some seafood. The idea here is you get your cut of steak or seafood and it comes on a stone. Now this stone is uber hot and allows you to cook your own steak and cook it how you like it. However you do not need to be a cook to be successful. In other words, you'd have a hard time burning the hell out of your steak or under cooking it where it is a bloody mess. Basically the stone allows you to slowly cook your streak while cutting nice bite size chunks away and fully cooking them to your own specification.

This allows two things in my book. 1) Keeps each bite nice and hot 2) Lets face it, it's a cool idea and adds the primal adventure of man cooking meat!

Now let me just say the cuts of meat are indeed good. These are no cheap cuts that will be tough or hard to cut through with your teeth/knife. The other cool thing is the dipping sauces they provide. They allow you to choose from sauces. Some are simple, while others are more fusion like.

Overall this was a great eat, fun place, and I thought it was cool. I would not recommend this for children, that stone is super hot so the chances of burn are pretty good. But like anything else you should know how to approach such situations."}
{"text":"What a fantastic idea for a restaurant.  You cook your own shit on a hot ass stone.  Just be careful not to burn your face off as you lay your head down to take a nap after a nice juicy steak.  The sauces they have to compliment your juicy meat are really good and the service was fantastic.

I wonder if I could bring one of these to wrigleyville.  Imagine 400 drunk cubs fans with third degree burns to their face."}
{"text":"Don't know why anyone gives this place less than 3 stars.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I would definitely come back to this place.  The hot stone that the steak comes on is their \"gimmick\"...but does set this place apart.  I've had steaks cooked on a hot stone in Japanese restaurants, but the stones tend to get cold quickly.  These guys take it another step...the stone stays hot throughout the meal!  I like my steak rare...so I had to eat my steak pretty quickly.  Although the steak was cooked more than how I like it near the end of the meal, their smorgasboard of sauces made it still delicious!  I had the chicken lemon soup....it was a lot thicker than any greek restaurants I've had...so I wouldn't recommend it...if you're expecting traditional...but if you have no idea how greek soup should be like...it's still pretty flavorful!  I'd go to Steak on a Stone over Flemings down the street any day!  The Filet was what I had....and it was a quality piece of meat."}
{"text":"Ehh, you are paying for the experience. In the end you come to terms with that you just payed a butt load of money to cook you're own food, and get sizzling grease splashed on your clothes."}
{"text":"The one star is for the novelty of the steak on a stone. Not much to say regarding the food; other than 'do give in to the temptation of having a steak on a stone. You will regret it as every tastes terrible."}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience at a Greek inspired steak house.  While the draw is serving a steak of your choice on a 750 degree stone, heated by two dragons; SoaS has a phenomenal menu including an array of mouth-watering Greek desserts.  If you enjoy good food, friendly service, and an good overall dining experience Steak on a Stone is for you!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell. 
* The signature steak (on a stone) was baller, the rest of it was just (kind of) average, though the dinner bread was also baller.
* The restaurant is in a strip mall, so not super charming on the outside, however the inside was nice.
* The menus desperately need an upgrade.
** Nice service, fun concept. Definitely worth a shot, the prices are quite fair, and we will most likely be back to try other options on the large menu!"}
{"text":"The bad. The restaurant is filthy. It looks like it has been a while since it has been cleaned. The ceiling around the air vents are all blackened. The fans in the middle of the restaurant were covered with dust and grease. The paint job needs redone since the floor boards are dinged up and whoever painted before didn't know how to use tape. And everything  had too much salt.
The steak on a stone dish was good though. I have cooked my own meat at Korean restaurants before, but this was the first time cooking on a stone. I tried the Greek potatoes and green beans as my sides. They were lukewarm when they came out in stark contrast to the 750 degree stone the steak cooked on. I have a rule while traveling  to not go to a place I could go to when I am home. This restaurant fit the bill, but I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks. This is the best beef I had in this town. The beef is amazingly beefy and full of flavor. It's only minimal basic seasoning for the steaks. There's a large variety of dipping sauce but I can eat and enjoy the steak wihout it. 

It smells like a steakhouse as you walk in there with all the guest busy cooking their steaks on the stone. The service is awesome and great for any occassions. 

The Greek food is also wonderful."}
{"text":"Overall, the experience was decent, but I wasn't very impressed with the novelty.  This is definitely a Greek-leaning restaurant with their main dish being the namesake.  Most people in my company ordered this.  They bring out each person's 750 degree stone with their meat on top.  You determine how well done the steak is by cutting slices and cooking it on the stone.  Everyone loved their steak.  It was very tender and flavorful.  The multitude of dipping sauce choices for the steak is totally unnecessary, as the steak was tasty.  However, I can grill at home.  Cooking my meal at the table isn't interesting enough for me to want to return any time soon."}
{"text":"This is a fun take for a steak house restaurant, but the atmosphere needs some serious revitalization. They have a whole Greek menu (which isn't really fitting the 'steak on a stone vibe'), but nonetheless the gist here is that you pick the cut of steak you want and they bring it out on a hot lava rock and you cook it bite size piece by piece as you eat it. The steak itself was great and it was unique to be able to cook it to yourself just to your liking. 

The one thing that was a real turn off was the atmosphere. The walls were plain white with plain tables and chairs, also their were huge loud fans hanging from the ceiling. There really was no atmosphere at all, which would not be ideal for a date night. From the white walls to the half Greek menu, this restaurant is unique but I left with the feeling that they were confused with what they want their restaurant to be.

Try the flaming cheese appetizer!"}
{"text":"On my last visit to Ohio, a friend took me here in an attempt to impress me with novelty. We went in for lunch on a Saturday and the place was near empty. The decor is generic family restaurant and could definitely use a makeover, but the staff was all very friendly and attentive.

Since I can't find a decent serving of grape leaves in Atlanta, I was thrilled by the grape leaves here. I wish I would have ordered two!
I had the lunch portion NY strip, on the stone so I could get into the experience. I really wanted to scoff at the idea, but I had fun with it and it tasted pretty good with all dipping sauce choices.

If I lived nearby, I would go again and try some more of Greek offerings on the menu. As far as the steak on a stone, it is fun for special occasions and guests."}
{"text":"I agree with Sean C. His review says it well. Nice people, clean and fun and tasty experience.   Not too expensive for steak and a nice place to take a date. Would not eat there everyday but was impressed for my first time there."}
{"text":"Had a large birthday dinner here & the family had fun! A molten rock stone slab with salted meat, searing each bite and sharing the experience with others was a fresh new concept to doing something outside the norm! Reading reviews I see gripes about the steak not being top notch (Like Hyde Park, Mortons) or paying \"butt loads\" to cook your own food. Crotics often get self absorbed in the process of critiquing and forget what attracts people to dine in certain places. The food is worth the menu pricing by all means and portions are not small which was good for sharing!  Bottom line the experience is fun and interactive. The choice of sauces was pretty plentiful for all types of styles and the have a very nice selection of seafood as well. We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"This is an update of the review I made on Steak on a Stone's Thanksgiving Day buffet.  My daughter and myself started to become ill the next day. Severe diarrhea and stomach cramps.   Tomorrow I will be filing a complaint with the Lake County Health Department.  I believe the food served was not held at correct temperatures to prevent food poisoning."}
{"text":"I am a recent employee of this horrid establishment and would love to share my two cents on what really goes on here. The two owners, Rodger and Cathy have absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant and care more about making money than they do keeping their employees/customers happy. I have witnessed them fire a kitchen employee because he gave a server a ramekin of blue cheese without a ticket being ran in! They also threatened to fire me because I added shredded cheese to a salad and not charge the customer an extra $2.

These are just minor issues compared to the concept and overall feel of the restaurant. First, the building was an old Don Panchos that shut down and there has been no renovations inside to give Steak on a Stone it's own feel. The walls still has the bright red paint left over from a Mexican Restaurant. They so desperately want to be an upscale, high-class restaurant but it will never happen. The employees wear polos with a patch on the chest which screams chain restaurant!! The also serve burgers and sandwiches which should NEVER be allowed on the menu at a STEAK house. 

The food is so-so but extremely overpriced. So If you want a $12 steak for $25 AND you have to cook it for yourself, be my guest. 

I only worked there for 3 months and the employee turnover was ridiculous. Within my first week there were 6 servers who quit. Over my 3 months I saw roughly 15 servers walk out the door because there was no structure and constant yelling from management. This explains the horrible service because chances are you are being served by someone who has only been working there for 2 weeks being trained by someone who has only been there a month!

I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants to have a good night out and enjoy a great, affordable meal. I wouldn't be shocked if they went out of business in the next 6 months."}
{"text":"I met up with my brother and some friends here to celebrate his birthday. We came on a Friday night, around 7-8, and it was pretty decent crowd. I believe our wait was about 20-30 minutes, so we sat at the bar in the front for a few drinks. 

The bar wasn't very impressive, and the drinks were over-priced for Akron, OH. But we all decided to have the bartenders Ralph and Wendy (16 year old twins) attempt to make us a couple cocktails.. It was entertaining to watch these fools pour drinks like they had just opened a \"My first Chemistry set\"... Anyways we got through it and finally made it to our table.

We all ordered the steaks, which are much more expensive than a local steakhouse. But we knew you were going to be paying a lot more for the \"experience\". We admired the lack of decor in the plain jane building as we waited for our steaks to arrive.

We were all new to here, and it turns out steak on a stone, really just means steak on a slab of hot granite countertop.. It was a pretty \"boring\" experience, and for the price I wouldn't do it again.

Nothing special here, thumbs down. :("}
{"text":"If I could have given this place no stars I would have. Everything about my visit was awful from the food, to the service, to the management, even the place was terribly cold and the restrooms filthy! Even the wait staff's shirt was filthy and she continually set her dirty shirted belly on our table! The only redeeming factor about this visit was the Greek salad which was not deplorable....so yay for Greek salad!?!"}
{"text":"It is a great dining experience, and love love love  the steak on a stone. I have taken clients here many times, and they said it was the best steak they have had. One of my favorite places to go in this area."}
