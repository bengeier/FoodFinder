{"text":"Great coffee to start your day and survive afternoon. Always great coffee, I've been coming here for a while"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. It's fine. Decent coffee, downtown prices, hipster service."}
{"text":"I ordered a latte and a scone to go. The latte was ok, but the scone was raw inside. I called to let them know their scones weren't cooked properly and the employee didn't apologize or offer to replace it, he just said \"ok, I'll let the owner know\"   I think if you sell uncooked raw baked goods, you should at least offer to replace it. It's basic customer service. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good place to be with friends; far from ideal to study or work at.  A cafe generally needs to meet two criteria: (1) drinkable coffee and (2) functional wi-fi.  Unfortunately, both areas did not meet expectations.  As I write this in a mildly perspiring state at the Coffee Bar, my two devices still cannot connect to the wi-fi. And the coffee tastes slightly better than The Coffee Bar's adjacent national chain neighbor.  By the way, if you're curious why I'm perspiring: no air conditioning.  One ceiling fan can barely keep my mood cool."}
{"text":"I really like this new coffee bar. I had the black forest steamer which was delicious and really tasted like black forest cake. I also had the banana bread which had a good amount of banana in it. The decor for this place is also very inviting and I love the map made of coffee beans, behind the counter. I will definitely go back to try their dark chocolate steamer as I love dark chocolate. The gentleman at cash was very friendly."}
{"text":"My most favourite cafe to go to! They have the best coffee and then cookies aren't bad either. Barista Matt is the sweetest guy ever! He takes his time to draw beautiful latte art on each and every cup of coffee, really talented.  He can draw all different latte arts from soccer player Cristiano Roanldo to minions and lots more :)   They have a nice second floor where you can chill with your friends while playing scrabble (which they provide for customers for free) and sipping on their tasty lattes."}
{"text":"When I was there on a Sunday morning, service was slow which hampered the experience. And somehow to large American is came to $8.48?"}
{"text":"Came in in the morning this week to grab a coffee and breakfast. Excellent service, great coffee, and a cool environment. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place has a very welcoming and relaxed feel which I love. All of the baristas are great. They have tasty salads, sandwiches, juices and a range of delicious cookies/bars complete with gluten free options. I make it a regular weekly lunch stop. Make sure you pick up a loyalty stamp card because chances are, you'll be back."}
{"text":"My first experience coming here, as I was recommended from my co-worker to try their Bullet Proof coffee.  It has a nice buttery taste.  They have a good selection of breakfast options.  I tried their ham sandwich, which was warmed for me.  The service was good, and each drink is freshly pressed.  The ambience is warm and inviting with a Western cowboy appeal.  I noticed pictures of actors and celebrities with their signed autographs nailed along the wall.  Coffee has a nice smooth taste, I will come back again!"}
{"text":"The coffee is tasty and the staff is great. It's a very relaxed atmosphere to read, work or have a chat."}
{"text":"Great espresso, have been in North America for 2 weeks and this was the first real espresso we had, strong flavor, smooth, great crema and aroma. We also had some very nice muffins. If you are looking for decent coffee this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A welcome change from all the Starbucks and Tim Hortons in the area. The chairs outside are a nice touch and their chillers are a great way to cool off in the summer.   Staff are always friendly. Decor is a little over the top on the wood but a lot of time and effort was put into it.   My only compliant is their choice for their menus and signage. Papyrus is awful please change it."}
{"text":"The Coffee Bar, as the name suggests, is a coffee bar :)  Stopped in here on a rainy Saturday afternoon to get some caffeine and to warm up.  The smells in here are amazing... and I was eager to try their coffee.  Ordered an Americano and a extremely large scone.  The coffee was very hot and very strong....pretty much exactly what I am looking for in my coffee so that made me happy.  The scone was very \"bready\".  I know that's not a word, but not sure how else to describe it.  It could have used some more berries, and sugar.  I really liked the decor of this place, and it was very quiet.  There are some board games you can play in the upstairs seating area.  The map made out of coffee beans on the wall behind the counter is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot chocolate and coffee to go. My husband who is a big coffee fan said the coffee was average and it wasn't hot enough. My hot chocolate was good, not too sweet but a bit heavy. I would go if it's on my way."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and their croissants are really nice. They also have some unique juice/smoothie flavours. I didn't really like their banana breads, etc. The coffee is ok. It tasted a little too strong/burnt to me but I suppose that's a matter of taste. Very convenient location.  The prices are a bit steep for what it is, especially since Tim Hortons is right next door."}
{"text":"I have been twice here for breakfast and Cuppuccino. And as mentioned in other review the friendliness of the staff could be hit or miss. But nothing to complaint about. The breakfast egg & ham and others are all pre-prepared but they are good. The best part and the reason for 5 stars is the coffee which was excellent and I found the place cosy to hang around. I haven't tried the velvet Latte wondering if it would be too sweet but it sounded quite enticing. This is a good place to hang out, get some nice coffee and a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Cozy, friendly, and close to the Harbourfront.  I once got the Nutella Latte and it was underwhelming. They have a crossword puzzle on a big table downstairs and a few games and a bookshelf upstairs."}
{"text":"Great coffee place...you have to try it to believe that they got the best latte! We had Nutella and Velvet  Latte it was so delicious."}
{"text":"Lattes are alright, nothing extraordinary. The location is a little odd, so the \"front patio\" has nothing to separate you from the Front Street traffic except a narrow sidewalk. The barista we had was super mellow and taking this time while a really long queue formed. I guess this is a place where you don't expect a coffee *stat*. You wait. You be patient. You savour the moment and all that jazz. It's that type of place. The front counter was littered with so many different treats and cookies...it was kind of overwhelming. There was a trivia challenge that you could engage with the barista but he didn't seem very informed about it, and when he asked us the trivia question for the week he was kind of mumbling so we couldn't hear it when he said it the 3rd time. In the end we gave up because we just wanted our coffee. Anyway, might not return unless I'm in the area and I crave a non-Starbucks latte."}
{"text":"The velvet latte was amazing!!!!! I will definitely be back for the bulletproof coffee and goji latte. I wish I could come here every morning."}
{"text":"What to expect from the cutest barista in Toronto? The best looking (& tasting) Velvet Latte!"}
{"text":"Hmm it's a lovely neighborhood establishment but $5 for a small 6 ounce butter coffee is a bit steep. Service is accommodating and the place is quiet though. Some interesting and new coffee options (goji latte and such)"}
{"text":"One of my new favourite coffee joints in this area. Coffee Bar Inc. definitely adds soul to this hood that could definitely use a lot of it. Great service, staff are awesome and I always end up making new friends :) Snacks and drinks I've ordered have always been yummy. Live music is awesome. Lots of seating upstairs. Board games to play w/!"}
{"text":"Umm newbie in town just found her favorite cafe! Yay excited!  BaristaBrian is just the sweetest! Check out his latte art when you're here next! I love finding a nice local cafe to make my weekend mornings exciting.. Yelp reviews showed me the way here and I'm glad I did.. It's a cute little place with seating upstairs, perfect to relish your morning coffee on a lazy Sunday!"}
{"text":"If I were to grade on just the coffee, I'd say it's alright, and give 4 stars.  We had velvet lattes, and they were alright.  Sweeter than I'd prefer, but whatever, it's something different.  However, they my wife bought a scone from here, and it might've been the worst scone I've ever had.  It was extremely dry and tasted like pure baking soda.  My wife's theory is that it's gluten free, but, I don't think I care.  This should not be a professionally made & sold item.  For selling this at all, I'm docking a star."}
{"text":"Very bad coffee ( it was bitter and taste strange) and service! I would rather go to Tim Hortons!"}
{"text":"Coffee Bar has very enjoyable lattes! I highly recommend hitting this place up over some big box coffee shop as their drinks menu is unique and delicious. They have a neat upstairs and area near the window for you to chill out. My friends and I don't get to come here too often but each time is a good experience."}
{"text":"Finally and oasis of sorts in this concrete jungle of condos. This area seems to be improving a bit after the initial few years of dreadful dreadful offering of shops/restaurants. The cafe is not much to look at from the outside though one does get this place is different when one gets in. Open interior with a wooden rustic finish worth a look if you are into this kind of thing. The sandwich offering looked decent and were enjoyed by my dinning companion. The desserts looked OK and we ordered a duo of cookies (lavender and salted chocolate chip) The chocolate was OK though a bit oily. The lavender cookie didn't fare well and felt like it was half baked. Might have been a day off so might try other offerings on the next visit. Now for the main attraction (caffeine fix in my case) I ordered the cappuccino and here is the verdict Espresso: Medium Crema': Decent Milk: Frothed Well Latte Art: Good A decent attempt at a capp I would say 2.5 to 3 stars. Worth a visit over chain offerings in this area."}
{"text":"Velvet latte and Crack cocaine brownie. ...yum! I don't normally like cinnamon in my latte but all the flavors worked well together."}
{"text":"These coffee shops are just everywhere!  I picked up some snacks but they were out of juices.  When you go after the lunch hour, that's what happens.  :(  There's a lot of seating, an upstairs area, and a few games you can play too.  They even have weekly yoga sessions?  Live music?  That's pretty cool.    Nice people work here."}
{"text":"Great coffee, food, and chill vibe! HIP and really friendly :)   Shout out to Dan on the guitar for entertaining my family while eating here"}
{"text":"I was very excited to find another Indy coffee shop in the heart of downtown. Service was very friendly and instantly felt welcomed. Pricing was very fair for the specialty coffees and very worth it. It has a cozy atmosphere and is quite a big space for a downtown location with two levels. I will definitely return when downtown!"}
{"text":"ehhh make whatever hipster jokes you want about this place (even I made fun of the font choice in their logo when it first appeared) but this place is now my go to. There's  not much in our concrete jungle but this place has one of my favourite tasting coffees. I go so frequently if it weren't for me being out of town so much, I'd have filled up way more loyalty cards. Everyone's super friendly and the owner was delightful to talk with as well.  I love the rustic wooden interior and on Tuesday nights they have live music on their second floor. They're definitely a company that likes to get involved with the community around them so give them a visit and introduce yourselves!"}
{"text":"The Velvet Latte was absolutely amazing, my friend who usually likes super sweet lattes even liked it as served. The rustic and cozy atmosphere paired with the friendly staff who were patient with my indecisiveness made this a cool and warm place."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful, and apparently open ridiculously late on weekends when you need something to sober you up. Great little indie spot, nice people, board games, and music a few times a week. Would recommend wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite cafe in Toronto. Customer service is amazing. I had the chance to meet the owner and she was very warm. I correctly answered her trivia question of the day and got a free hot chocolate, which was delicious. The amaretto flavour shot was divine. The barista is a talented artist and he created a picture of a panda bear on my beverage, which was super cute. The ambiance is warm and inviting, and they even have board games on the second floor. It's a great place to kick back and relax and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great coffee and great atmosphere. Love the patio in the summer time! Pricey but a good change from your usual Starbucks and Timmy's."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Friendly staff. I would have loved some butter for my scone but made up for it with the free wifi. I admit that wifi doesn't taste quite the same as butter on a scone but we all have our crosses to bear."}
{"text":"It was a really good break in the city with this good coffee bar not too far from the city's famous attractions. It also offered free Wi-Fi which was a plus."}
{"text":"Delicious velvet latte and a decent oatmeal cookie. Pleasant quiet vibe with live music (dude on guitar). Beautiful coffee artistry, too!"}
{"text":"Lovely place, the coffee is amazing here. I'm really happy I found this place and the stuff is friendly and nice. I would definitely recommend this coffee shop"}
{"text":"The scones and food is OK. The coffee art is really amazing but the taste is certainly not the best that I have had in my life. The wifi is really poor quality. Wouldn't recommend this place to go to often."}
{"text":"Stopped here a few times during my Toronto weekend. It was always about the same - decent with interesting stuff, but lines take forever. My fiancee thought the latte was fine, nothing impressive. They ran out of soy milk (this was early in the morning on a Saturday), so had to finish w Almond milk, which she isn't a fan of. I got a breakfast sandwich, which wasn't bad. They had no salt, pepper, or hot sauce to add, which was both surprising and disappointing. Service was great. Had a brownie chocolate cookie, which was crispy, warmed up nicely - tasted like a hot chocolate cookie. really liked it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Got a wonderful cappuccino. A young women helped me at the counter and was super sweet. Coffee is very smooth and tasteful. Definition worth the walk! Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"*Update! I'm here right after a blue jays game and somehow everyone is packed into the Tim's next door, but this place had room for my group of five on the patio and upstairs! We chose upstairs for an epic game of scrabble. Quality of the coffee is excellent, just like the first time and the music is sweet! *  I hadn't had a coffee all day, so naturally I was jonesing for one sooo bad, and then suddenly BOOM! Walked right past this place, and thought \"let's check this out!!\".   The decor was pretty sweet, most notably the badass and HUGE world map made of coffee beans right behind the main counter.  I ordered \"the best cortado in the world\" from the barista, who was super nice, and guess what I got? One of the smoothest, best tasting cortado's I've ever had!  I also ended up getting some mini-cupcakes which were awesome :)  I was in quite a rush, so I didn't get to check out the upstairs, or order other drinks to see if there was consistency, but I'm definitely going to go back when I get a chance."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this place really a great addition to the neighborhood. I'll start by saying this is a small place, but they seem to know what they're doing. Their desserts are wonderful, and the coffee is brewed really well, with a nice roast on the beans and a lot of care in the preparation.   I've been there a few times, and every time the people are really friendly, they're good with joking around and chatting with the customers.   The actual space is quaint, but this just adds to the appeal. This is really the type of place that is great if you want a nice cup of coffee, a latte, or some other specialty drink.   I enjoyed their coffee, espresso, and I really liked the Velvet Latte, it was really good. The price is fair as well, comparable to most other coffee shops. The desserts are great too, I think I've had a few too many, but I'll regretfully go back for more (they're too good to pass up).   I plan on trying more of their coffees and desserts, but overall, this is a great stop for my morning commute. This is definitely a 5 star coffee shop, and they are my new go to spot."}
{"text":"I like the set up here. Lot of seating and staff was friendly. Great selection as well. Comfortable chairs and large space to read if you wanted to."}
{"text":"Came in here to grab a latte to go, and enjoyed it. I saw a sign that said they have bullet proof coffee, which I really want to try. They should think about advertising that more."}
{"text":"Straight up, the worst cafe to go to in Toronto. I've been to a lot, just your average Torontonian, we love the coffee scene. But if you want to go to an anti-Toronto place, this is the place! Terrible weird decor, a mix of an out of place cowboy vibe and out of date fonts.   The owners have created a place of fear. You can see it in the timidity of the staff, and the general way they lack creativity. The owners are old has beens stuck in a time warp. Places were run differently 30 years ago, and thank F times have changed! Not here though. Their fear regime spreads to the customers too - these tyrants have kicked people out for using their wifi, plugging in laptops, and not dressing appropriately (whatever that means, not cowboy enough?).   Country hicks trying to run a Toronto shop. Toronto is dominated by quality espresso shops with easy going and collaborative vibes. This place has only survived because of the CN Tower tourist trap, other than that it's a dead zone."}
{"text":"This was a surprising find in this neighbourhood. It is next to a Tim Hortons, but is clearly targeting a different coffee consumer. I bought an Americano that was pretty good. The interior is lots of wood, and very brown. They also have pies from Kanga and other small eats. There is a nice little patio and lots of space inside to sit. This is easily the best place to get a coffee in this little block. I'd give this three stars normally, but there really is nothing better very close by. (Sense Appeal is a short walk away, but yeah, it's a short walk away.)"}
{"text":"Real coffee. If you don't like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, second cup, etc, go here. Fast service and very good coffee"}
{"text":"For a takeout americano = 5 stars  For sit-in: a disaster. They seem to actively want people to not be here. It's always too hot, partly because there's no AC, but also because the heating is cranked in winter. The music is too loud, at least when the employees can stop fiddling with what's playing as if the teenagers passing the aux cord around at a party.   The coffee is really good! They just seem to want nobody to drink one... in which case, why open a coffee shop?"}
{"text":"Super cute little cafe! Had their cortado and it was excellent. Perfect balance of espresso and creaminess. Could even taste a hint of cocoa. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Nutella Latte and Organic chai lattes are delicious. The baristas are friendly and funny. Cozy coffee house. I love that they have not just one but three games of scrabble here to play."}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem in downtown as mostly it is surrounded by chains.. liked their  cappuccino and the Carrot cake was good too! Interiors are something to talk about.. rustic and neat. I'm glad i went there on  sunday but i've seen it being busy on normal days."}
{"text":"I wanted something that want Starbucks or Tims. As soon as you walk in, serenity now.....the music., the decor, the vibe. Welcome to a west coast coffee place.  In house baked goods. Breakfast wraps and sandwiches. They also seem to have a great selection of teas.  Coffee wasn't spectacular. Which as disappointing.  Want to step away from the bustle of Toronto. Give it a try. Free wifi."}
{"text":"So far, this is my most favourite coffee shop I've found in Toronto.   Please do yourself a favor and order the Velvet Latte! It's a sweet, silky latte with a touch of cinnamon. I will walk far out of my way to grab this addictive treat!  Having visited this spot for the first time in March of last year on a trip out to the big city, I remember returning home to Edmonton and being devastated that none of the local coffee shops had something comparable to my Velvet Latte.   The atmosphere is rustic and romantic. Grab a spot on the leather chairs upstairs next to the fireplace and cozy up next to your special someone.  Did I mention they take the time to create incredible coffee art? If the coffees weren't so delicious, you might have a hard time taking that first sip!  This place is a nice escape from the hustle of the city. Make sure to stop in!  -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"The Nutella latte is amazing and the service is really friendly. The wifi sometimes doesn't work and they're \"not allowed\" to reset it. Also it's super hot in the summer."}
{"text":"The velvet latte was ok, it was smooth but nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the ginger molasses cookie it tasted weird like it had unmixed baking powder and it was grainy. The crack cocaine cookie on the other hand was very good!!"}
{"text":"Lattes are not so great. Mainly due to their  size. Think Tim Hortons quality with third wave  prices   No one wore fedoras in the Wild West"}
{"text":"Great coffee but you pay the price & the friendliness of staff is hit or miss - thus the 4/5. But it's a nice treat once in a while.  On the flip side, they do have a loyalty card so after buying 10 specialty drinks at $5-6.50 (depending on size, etc) you get one free!  Wayyyy better than the Tim Horton's next door in terms of quality of coffee.   They also sell coffee beans and grind them to your specifications which I bought today so I can make espressos and lattes at home for much cheaper.   As well as breakfast sandwiches and dinners to go by local chefs for ($7.99).   If you don't mind a noisy patio, although there's is simple, since I live in the area I like to sit down and sip my latte and watch the world walk by.   Would I recommend to a friend who could afford it? YES!   Will I come again? YES!"}
{"text":"One guy who works there has a serious attitude problem. The super rude guy said his name was Vinny. He pushed through us physically and kept shooing us away because we were in his way apparently the whole time we were in the store. He seemed mad because someone had spilled something and he had to clean it up. He even raised his voice to tell us to back away from his side of the counter when we had moved out of his way to another part of the coffee shop that was also in his way... We said we wanted to see the teas they were selling then he said we have to ask for them one by one and he will pass them to us. No need to get territorial about the wall of fancy tea or mop closet. So you hate your life or are having a bad day but don't take it out on the customers that are spending money where you work. We were there ready to drop $20 on an extravagantly-priced tin of tea because someone wanted it as a gift, we were in a hurry, and it was one of the places on the list of the company's site. Next time I need that specific product I'll definitely be going elsewhere. There are plenty of other local retailers with better service that sell Sloane tea--they're all listed on the Sloane tea website. Funny, my previous review was saying how great the service was here. I'm sure that guy wasn't working that day.   Fortunately, another guy, however, was super friendly and helpful. I had spoken to him over the phone to ask questions about specific product he had available and he was helpful over the phone so we decided to come in. He was patient, knew about the product, seemed to have tried them all, and ultimately he helped us pick something the person we were giving it to loved, so that's great that he led us in the right direction. Very helpful and knowledgeable. His suggestion was a big win and was exactly what she wanted.   It's a shame because it seems like whoever runs the place cares about their reputation enough to carry high-quality sought-after products. They seem to have a fairly good reputation otherwise from other patrons, as well as from my previous experience, as well as my experience with the guy I spoke to on the phone who later helped me pick the tea. Unfortunately, they made a bad hiring decision with the first guy who was super rude who shouldn't have a public-facing role."}
{"text":"Came here twice during my weeklong visit. The barista on Sunday was a wizard with latte art! However, the berry scone I got was obviously baked together with the pizza scone because it tasted like pizza...which was very weird. The latte was a bit bitter for my taste though."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to come in and review The Coffee Bar Inc. a couple weeks after its grand opening. The cafe is located on Front and Spadina, an area which is saturated with condos and commercial quick-serve restaurants. When I arrived, I was excited to find out that there were two floors to the cafe. There weren't many cafes out there that had a second floor, so The Coffee Bar Inc. was the first one I visited. I really liked the upstairs space, which provided comfortable couches and a fireplace. The cafe had a rustic modern design with some personal touches. The owner and her family own a farm and horses so their decor reflected that traditional barnyard feel. I definitely enjoyed a couple of the the plates they had on the wall! Another thing I thought was fascinating was that they collected wood from old barns and refurnished them into furniture. Each hand-carved wooden furniture had a name plate stating how old the wood was and where it originated from. They also have some fun art done by their barista.  When I spoke to the owner, Marie, about what inspired her to open up The Coffee Bar Inc., she told me she saw there was a lack of community space within the area. This is very true for those who are familiar with Front and Spadina. Most of the businesses nearby are fast-food joints. Marie wanted to offer a community space for the residents and so far she has been receiving great response!  I got to try a few items that they offer at the cafe. I highly recommend the Velvet Latte. It tastes exactly how it sounds, very smooth and great for latte lovers. I really liked the Lavender Shortbread Cookie from Cafe Neon, which I tried to savour but failed because I kept eating it until I was done. Also, I got to taste one of the mini Bite Me cupcakes for the first time so that was a threat as well! I think my favourite was getting to try the Agave Espresso BBQ Chicken sandwich from Foodbenders. The Turkish bread on the sandwich was absolutely delicious. I sort of wished that I asked for my sandwich to be heated up because I'm pretty sure it would've tasted ten times as amazing. So if you haven't tried Foodbenders' sandwiches yet, I highly recommend them! I can definitely see why they are becoming popular in cafes.  To involve the community, The Coffee Bar Inc. has open mic every Monday and Tuesday starting sometime in April or after. There is also yoga every Sunday morning from 8:30 AM and 9:30 AM and a 5K run club right after at 10 AM. For anyone who is successful in completing the 5K route (the route is different each time), you'd be able to get 50% off your Americano when you make your way back to the cafe. So definitely a great opportunity for you to connect with your community and have some great coffee!  Just to note, the cafe has no outlets available for any who plans on bringing their laptop to do work. The baristas would be more than happy to charge it for you while you wait but there are no outlets available by any seating areas. So if you are like me and have a laptop that dies after 10 minutes without being plugged in, I don't recommend you bringing it to the cafe."}
{"text":"Great coffee in a part of town full of chain restaurants, cool, independent and lots of character. And super cool latte art!! Only complaint is being given my delicious sandwich in a paper bag despite asking for \"eat in\" (and watching other food go out on plates)."}
{"text":"The Coffee Bar is a welcome additional to a dismal selection of businesses below the condos at Front and Spadina. I raised an eyebrow at this place opening up pretty much immediately next door to a Tim Hortons, but I suppose the clientele base will be different.  There is seating for about 10 on the first floor and a nice little loft area up top that seats perhaps another 10.   I popped in a day or two after opening day for an espresso, and the following day for a brewed coffee. Espresso was very nice. Both times there was a bit of confusion paying, but assuming this will be fine now once staff get settled in.   They have a variety of baked goods here with many vegan options."}
{"text":"Cozy. Tasty. Experts. Super cozy cafe set in a cross between a Jackson Hole film set and an unpretentious Silicon Valley coffee house. Nutella Latte is delicious and additional offerings like Chicory Root Chillers, protein smoothies, and creative coffee art show round out a small but well curated cafe experience. Do not miss the not so secret upstairs area with cozy games and chairs for working."}
{"text":"You can see CN tower while having a great Gorji latte. Lovely decorations and great chat. Lovely cafe I will come back"}
{"text":"I came to this hidden gem on Front St on a Wednesday evening, they close a little later than the other coffee shops (7pm) so already it was a win for me. I ordered a Chai latte and it was made fresh, I think with steeped Chai and none of that pre-made Chai milk liquid. Really good. It was around $5.75 for a large size, which is a bit on the pricey side. The barista was also really friendly and jammed on the guitar for a bit, it was fantastic. Didn't have any problems with the wifi, and the atmosphere was great. Really love the wood interior. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really yummy coffee and snacks, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE wifi. Doesn't even work. Space is super nice and quiet but it's probably because no one is ever there."}
