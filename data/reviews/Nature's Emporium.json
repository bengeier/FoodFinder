{"text":"I basically live at Nature's Emporium. I especially love the hot table... it seriously gives Whole Foods a run for its money some days.
The staff here are EXCELLENT. Always so helpful and cheerful, other grocery stores around town should take note. 
The only cons are that sometimes they don't have specific fruits or veggies but I understand that if its not available organic then there won't be any until the supply is ready and I respect that. Obviously it can be a little pricey since it is organic, especially the meat. But I do believe in quality over quantity.
Nature's is my first stop for anything organic or when I need to buy supplements."}
{"text":"4.5 stars overall.  
-0.5 star because they have limited choice of hot table; my kids couldn't find anything to eat for lunch there. 
Firstly, cheese section, LOVED IT!  They have a lot of sample available and the lady working in the cheese section was extremely helpful and able to find the right cheese for you and your family. 
Fresh bread from Ace Bakery: not a lot of choice but more selection under frozen section. 
I noticed that their baby section is getting smaller and less selection for the past few times I went.  They used to carry vegan colour crayons and other art and craft toys but not anymore but for baby food section, it's pretty much remained the same.  
We got most of our baking, cosmetics and supplements there. When they were on sale, you would able to find a very good deal.
This store is much bigger than the one in Vaughan.  If driving is not an issue, I strongly recommend you to go to this location.  
I usually grabbed a coffee on my way out.  They usually have deal for coffee and one bakery item for $4 or something.  I feel much better to eat their bakery goods than those at *bucks :)
They also have roasted whole chicken deal for $25 or something with 2 salads, yummy organic chicken.  
They have excellent customer service; everyone work there are very friendly and helpful.  
They never run out of buggies/shopping carts.  
I found that it's a bit hard to find a parking even during weekdays. 
They have two sitting ares and both of them are nice and clean; no sticky tables and chairs YEAH!!!"}
{"text":"Just came back from the store.  I love that place.  I was first introduced to it by a co-worker (thanks Tiziana) to buy some Manuka honey.  The first time I stepped into the store I was totally impressed with their selection of everything but especially the cheese section. AND...most of the cheeses you can sample without asking someone for it. I have never had items from the hot table but I bought the in-store made spelt crust pizza.  Oh my gosh, best, best pizza ever.  But what brings me back to Nature's Emporium in Newmarket is the staff at this store.  Super friendly, EXTREM knowledgable.  You just need to look at a product for 2 seconds and someone ask you if you need help with this item or if you have any other questions.  I got very useful free tips on health and diet."}
{"text":"Could it be that I am in love with a store?  With loads of prepared foods and organic offerings at consumer -friendly prices this store has become one of my regular haunts.  

There's a beautiful selection of fruits and vegetables all certified organic, more cheeses than I knew existed, prepared foods for take-out, fresh meats and seafood, a bakery, and a well-organized supplement department staffed with experts including  registered Naturopaths, Homeopaths, Nutritionists and Herbalists. (Excuse my long sentence, but it just conveys my enthusiasm!)  If they don't have what you need, they'll get it for you.   Shopping here at this  over 50,000 square foot facility is a breeze with super-friendly and well-staffed check-outs"}
{"text":"I was starving at lunch time today, and turned to Yelp to help me find a Vegan option in Newmarket. This led me to Natures Emporium. 

I was very pleased with the selection on their salad bar and their vegetarian/vegan hot bar. As with all of these cafeteria style eateries, you do have to be really mindful of what you put in your plate, because it can add up quickly. I regularly go to Whole Paycheque downtown Toronto, so I'm very accustomed to this and I know how to load my plate. I'm always mindful of things that are \"heavy\" like lasagna or Mac and cheese. If something is really dense, it will obviously cost more to fill your plate! To cut costs, opt for salads, loosely pack your plate, and just buy what you will actually eat. When possible, sometimes I will use a soup container instead of a large bowl or plate to help me keep the quantity in check. 

I opted for some gluten-free brown rice pasta, topped with veggies and a bit of tomato sauce. It was tasty, just like real, home cooked food. Not loaded with sodium and all of the other crap. 

In all I got my pasta, a water, an apple and a date square for $16. 

I will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and the experience has been overall good. But last time i got food from the hot table the quinoa was bitter. Then my kid for some reason wouldnt eat the pizza slice i bought him. Later i thought i would finish it and i realized that the pepperoni was very chewy and i wondered how he could eat any of it at all. We came home hungry and ate leftovers that we wanted to avoid to start with."}
{"text":"Nature's Emporium is the go-to health food store in the Newmarket area stocking plenty of organic produce, hormone free meat, bulk items and supplements.

There's also a large deli area where you can order something to-go or load up a tray from one of their many buffet style trollies. When you're done, walk everything to the front of the store where they'll weigh your plate to determine price.

\"Your total comes to $33.00\" I'm told. Wait, what? My eyes glaze over slightly as I stare down at our barely filled plates of chick pea curry, falafels and apply celery salad. Talk about your sticker-shock. But what are you going to do, put it back? No. You'll pay and try really hard to enjoy it.

While their deli may not provide the best value, do check out their great selections of oils, grains, beans and veggies when you're in."}
{"text":"Great gluten free and organic hot table

Their grocery can be expensive for organic but i trust their buyers over Fortinos

their POS system likes to overcharge with no apology or credit

The sign says $2.99 and the charge $3.29

And other examples i cannot be bothered with explaining

They have a Hot Table for lunch and I had Thai Curry , some salad, and Quinoa and it came out to almost $20 . Expensive for sure but it was very good

Extensive cheese selection is impressive but is higher priced compared to Grande Cheese

Organic shopping continues to be very expensive but they offer a huge selection with poor customer service

Take advantage of their sales but after feeling gouged at the cash and going through multiple price checks for miss priced items at check out I feel i dont need the extra work to keep them honest. If you cant keep your POS accurate then it means your dishonest.

Never, ever had this concern with their competitors

When you feel that you are taken for granted and have check out anxiety then it is time to move on to other retailers

They do not price match. Walmart had a PGX promo and they would not bother to match. I know go to Walmart and price match  against their flyer pricing.

Who thought to shop the big W for organics?"}
{"text":"I was in here for the first time a few month back and I was really impressed with the size of the store. This is consider and ECO store and in my mind most if not all ECO stores are small. Not this place. 

They have all the same departments that any other grocer would have but it is all organic or natural. The selection is great, I especially liked the little restaurant they have. Everything is made fresh using the very ingredients you will find on the shelves, can't go wrong with that. 

The health and beauty section is mixed with their wellness section, I found lots of great brands and products. Plus I picked up a guide to healthy eating, something I have been trying to do for a few years now. I will defiantly go back soon."}
{"text":"I never went into this store until I needed some vitamins and supplements and now I see what all the fuss is about! They have exceptional customer service and the largest selection of supplements. I went in for something they didn't carry (which is very unusual) and they immediately offered to get it for me. My order came quickly, it came when they said it would, and they called me as soon as it was in. This is the kind of service I appreciate and that is why I don't go anywhere else. They have a wide variety of teas which I love - kinds you can't get in regular grocery stores. Their prices are slightly higher than other stores but everything is good quality. The staff is always friendly and helpful and I always leave with what I was looking for. A great place to visit in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"When I win the lottery and can treat money as water, I will give them five stars.  Yes, it is very impressive as other reviewers have mentioned.  Lots of variety and some quite unique food, not only organic but also gourmet.

My general qualm about the organic and local food movement is that if --  as I suppose some foodies wish, all food sold was in this manner -- all poor and most middle class families would not be able to afford it, at least not without sacrificing something else in their life.

If price is not an issue for you and being \"echt\" organic is, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Nature's Emporium for their breakfast bar.

Nature's emporium is a natural food store that also serves fresh food, coffee, teas, has fresh baked goods, soups, etc.  Sort of a healthy grocery store with vitamins and fresh food, and more.

I stopped in today to try out their breakfast buffet.  It is my first time.  I typically have my favourites that I go to.

The food was very good.  I came in at 830 am, so the buffet had just been put out. 

There were lots of choices, oatmeal, eggs, bacon, sausage, keilbosa, potatoes, fruit, etc.

They also had a cook onsite running an omelette and crepe bar.

The food was very fresh.  I quite enjoyed my breakfast.

The food is charged based on weight, and you can have as much or little as you want.  Mine hit a hefty $18, but too be fair, I was at a sleep study and didn't really sleep well, so I needed a large breakfast to get me through the day.

Fortunately, Nature's Emporium goes out of their way to cater to people with food issues.  I must eat strictly gluten free, and I have to avoid most grains as well.  There was an abundance of food, and the chef was an interesting fellow just looking to provide the best food experience that he could.

They have the breakfast buffet on Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays. They have a card that allows you to get a free meal after every 10 meals ($15 value).

A great meal and a very pleasant experience.

PS don't expect fine china: paper plates and metal cutlery, and you can take it away with you as well."}
{"text":"I like a lot of things about Natures Emporeum and one thing that I DON'T like: It's too far away from my house LOL.

The store moved into the space previously occupied by Weston Produce (remember them?)  And upped the game.

You have:
- a lot of healthy food options, all under one roof
- prices that are on the high side but more tamed than those at many other organic / natural food places I've been to
- many products from local farms.
- some products that (as far as I know) can only be found here

Examples? I can think of a few:
- Whole cocoa beans (the closest I could find is cocoa bits at Whole Foods)
- Cocoa bits covered in dark chocolate (great alternative to candy and other sugary stuff)
- Cool glass canisters for sprouting

... and I'm sure there are more things that I can't remember now or don't know about.

All in all, my favourite store. Wish it was a bit closer."}
{"text":"Great store. The people in the supplement/medicine section are extremely helpful and take time to explain your different options for whatever you are looking for. Although the products can be quite expensive, it's worth the money...at least for most things. I really trust this store and I know all their products are organic so I don't have to spend time looking at the labels. It's very clean and the layout of the store is done in an efficient manner. They have a nice variety of organic prepared food that you can take out

Great store, highly recommended for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Not just pretentious and expensive, but sells lots of cheese labelled \"organic\" that definitely does not have organic certification. 

Shelves are littered with sale stickers that are merely discounts over ridiculously inflated prices, still more expensive than regular prices in the area. 

Plus: all produce us sold as organic. Minus: many fruits moldy the next day."}
{"text":"Hands down the best organic food store I've ever been to. 

This is why:

1) You don't have to worry about carefully reading the product label - you can trust their selection. 
2) They carry ranges of quality so you have product depth as well and have a choice in how much you want to spend. 
3) They have excellent sales every now and then and it can turn you into a Hoarder!
4) They carry a wide range of products from prepared foods, groceries, cleaning supplies, baby supplies to vitamins. 
5) Staff are so well trained its shocking. Seriously, go ask the meat deli for chia seeds and you'll still get an answer -and a recommendation too while they're at it. 

I love what they've done here and I can't wait to see a southern expansion. My only complaint is that they need a little bit of a bigger selection on their sushi grade fish and beef. Otherwise kudos to carrying ostrich; bison and varying qualities of chicken."}
{"text":"I love Nature's Emporium.  This store is fantastic in just so many ways.  From it's great selection of products, to friendly and efficient staff this is my favourite Toronto supermarket.

My absolute favourite part of this store is their cheese section.  They have a wide range of cheeses from all over the world and it's a great collection.  Lot's of raw milk and organic cheeses.

The store itself is very clean and very well laid out."}
{"text":"The produce department is outstanding...it's all organic and the prices are very comparable to non-organic at other grocery stores. Amazing freshness and quality.
Selection in the grocery aisles is incredible, and the vitamin department is mind-boggling. They have absolutely everything!
The only problem...the staff. Not the check-out staff, they are all super friendly and nice. I'm talking about the staff in the store...not very helpful or interested in helping customers find things/answer simple questions.
Other than that, Nature's Emporium is an amazing store."}
{"text":"Nature's Emporium is just impressive!! 

I always a little bit skeptical about \"Health\", \"Holistic\", \"All Natural\" and \"Organic\" food store but my experience at Nature's might just have change my mind.

Huge Selections of everything and anything!! The best cheese selections I have seen, 400?! different cheeses including  raw, organic cow, goat, sheep from local and overseas..

Deli, Prepared Food, Bulk Food, Meat even Coffee and Tea. 

Supplements, Health Products and Even Cosmetic!!

I never know there's so many options and choices in a health food store till I visit Nature's Emporium and the prices are surprising competitive too!!"}
{"text":"I needed Dr. Hauschka products and both my usual stores (Ambrosia and Healthy Planet) didn't have anything in stock. My friend suggested Nature's Emporium so I popped over and I'm so happy to have gone in! It was glorious! I found item after item that I needed and more - I'm pretty sure at one point I heard angels singing. The store is packed to the rafters with every kind of natural product. They have tonnes of variety and the employees are kind and helpful. I was so thrilled not to have to resort to shopping at multi-billionaire sociopath Jeff Bezos' Whole Foods, but instead I was able to support a great Canadian business! Their prices are reasonable, the store is organized, and there is lots of free parking in the plaza lot. I wish Nature's Emporium the best of luck expanding and hope they open a location near me one day. In the meantime I will definitely be going back for my regular shopping!! Yay!"}
