{"text":"Friendly staff! Not a lot of seating in this place but it a takeout spot so go figure. I always order here, usually a go to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"The coworkers and I partook in dinner here tonight. They have a few tables to sit down and done if you'd please, but it's really a takeout joint. I asked for spicy chicken hunan and the house special lo mein. I got small sizes, and they came with a pint of rice too. One small dinner was enough to fill my needs though, so be careful if you want leftovers. The two dishes were both made spicy and I loved the portions. Small pieces of meat mixed with larger portions. Vegetables were fresh, and the sauces were on point. Only paid 10$ for the two small dinners and I had half of each left. Takes them about 12 minutes to cook a meal if you are a walk in."}
{"text":"5 star Chinese takeout. Simple, fresh, flavorful, fast Chinese takeout that's fairly close to my house and isn't expensive. Been looking for a good Chinese takeout place since we moved here last year. This is it."}
{"text":"I used to love this chinese restaurant until I got food poisoning from their pad Thai. I was so incredibly sick that I will never return. Customers beware!!"}
{"text":"Well This week is my birthday and after a friend pushed me to let her take me to lunch at her fav Chinese food here!I never ate here before and gave it the EggRoll test What the H don't people know how to make an Egg rolls anymore?cause This place it wasn't hand made it was a frozen one you get at a supermarket horrible. Only a yellow shredded cabbage, nothing else but it was Soggy in center raw! And I asked Waitress for hot Tea? Was told we don't have that? I live in San Diego and they brought a pot of hot tea before you ordered! I long for those places here.! Well my friend ordered I forgo'd it & checkout said to cashier That was the worst EggRoll ! She said\" sometimes you have good days & bad days? Never again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time two nights ago. He had the bourbon chicken and I had the curry with chicken both definitely could've used more sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, the place was very clean and we didn't have to wait long. Will visit again soon"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Food was really good.  The portions are great.  The kids got the combo platters that came with fried rice and egg rolls, great price.  We ordered from the House Specials portion of the menu, the container was packed full of meat and seafood.  All veggies were fresh."}
{"text":"i was enjoying my pad thai until i looked at the chicken and it looked like a rat tail or something i had to stop eating."}
{"text":"I've been craving Chinese for a few weeks now. I haven't found my go to spot in the area yet, but I'd been by this place a time or two and had not been turned off by anything.   I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan and some fried rice. Everything was ready in maybe 5 min. The dining area was small but tidy. I chose to eat at home though. The fried rice satisfied my craving, nothing special but just what I needed to hit the spot. The MGGP even had fresh zucchini, a nice surprise. All was reasonably priced. No where near gourmet but if you're looking for typical Chinese takeout, it'll do!"}
{"text":"Below average Chinese food. Eggrolls appeared frozen and were not good. Sweet and Sour Shrimp was mostly breading and greasy. Fried rice was not typical Chinese fried rice and didn't have much flavor. Wonton soup was most basic soup with just broth and wontons. Will not come back and would never recommend."}
{"text":"Come to pittsburgh for a two night stay for shopping and my parents refused to eat fast food for dinner and wanted Chinese food instead. So I choose this restaurant as it was the closest to the hotel with a good review. When I first walked in I was surprised it wasn't like a restaurant but a food courts style where you order and take the food home.   I order 3 pint of shrimp fired rice in Chinese and it cost around $20. The owner absolutely refused to take the order to us in Chinese and force us to order in English. I wasn't angry but the order is still written in Chinese and the owner still yelled out the order in Chinese to the kitchen anyways so what was the problem for me ordering in Chinese?   The food came quickly in less then 5 minutes and we took it back to our hotel. It was hard to eat it out of the oyster pail but the food tasted OK but they really over done it with the oil and salt. (We tasted that they put a LOT of MSG) We were so thirsty afterwards we had to chugged down almost a gallon of water.   The next day, we went back and order the same thing but this time asking for less oil and salt. This time, it actually tasted way better then the first and we were not all thirsty afterwards. Mine recommendation, order it with less salt and oil.  Minus 1 star for food. Minus .5 star for value.  Minus .5 star for service."}
{"text":"Always quality, hot tasty food. And plenty of it for the cost.  Different than most typical take- outs with the same old wontons.  This family cares about the quality of the food and their customers.  My daughter lived in China and noted some of the popular Chinese restaurants in Sq. Hill were \"legit\" and good but Golden Dragon was still her favorite!"}
{"text":"Tried take-out here and it's just far too salty. My entire family was guzzling drinks for the rest of the evening. The egg rolls appear to be frozen store-boughts. Prices are slightly on the high side. Location is pretty convenient. They appear to be mostly take-out with almost no in-house seating. The salt issue is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"If you want food poisoning eat here. It is not listed on the menu, it is disguised as Chicken Fried Rice. Usually available around 8:30 at night.  Skip this crap hole and go to Moe's instead  Heed this warning or sacrifice 6 hours of your life locked in your bathroom..."}
{"text":"This restaurant puts no effort at all into soups or egg rolls.  They just buy the same Wonton's and egg rolls that you would buy in the frozen food department.  The Shrimp and Chicken dishes aren't bad but unless you order extra sauce...you get almost no sauce at all.  I judge all Chinese places by their Crab Rangoon's.  They have decent Crab Rangoon's but they are way over priced for what they give you.  The entire menu is over priced to be truthful. I tried to order 1 and a half orders of Crab Rangoons and you would think I asked them to cure cancer.  They out right refused to sell me 1 whole order plus a half order.  I told them they lost a customer because they refused to sell me a 1.5 order and they couldn't have cared less.  I will not go back to this place."}
