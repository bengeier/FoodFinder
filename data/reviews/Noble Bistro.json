{"text":"We happened to walk in on New Years Eve to this restaurant by chance.  Wow !!! We were so impressed and happy with this find.    Food was unbelievable.  Lobster Lasagna and White Chocolate Desert featured on the Set Menu were a definite must have.    Service was impeccable.  Staff were friendly.  Manager and Head Chef personally came to our table to ask about the food.  This restaurant obviously prides itself on customer service.    Considering we were not dressed for the occasion and we had a 2 year old they were absolutely fantastic and made our New Years.    Thank you to the everyone for taking time away from your family and friends to work and make our dinner and NYE special.    We will definitely be recommending this restaurant to others and if we make the drive down from Collingwood next time this will be on our fav list.    Thank you again."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! Definitely the same quality of bistro food you expect at a downtown Toronto bistro. The farm to table concept works well here - local produce and proteins are the stars of the show. I definitely recommend the chicken gnocchi, which is pillowy soft, as a good gnocchi should be. The pork chop was perfectly cooked - not over or under - and the spaetzle was delicious. We are picky, and were so happy with our meal @ Nobel Bistro."}
{"text":"Chef Johnross has opened what should be an amazing success in downtown Oakville. The menu is terrific The staff are friendly & helpful  The environment is great Noble offers private dinning & private function facilities  The wine cellar is constantly growing  My new regular Hang out when in Oakville"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was skeptical when I read the rave reviews about Chef Johnross.  However, they were right! My husband and I went with another couple and every appetizer and entrée was incredible.  Our only complaint was the triple chocolate mousse dessert but this is where the amazing service was most noticed.  Our waiter noticed that no one ate the dessert so he asked what we didn't like about it (the texture was granular and chaulky).  He took the desserts off of our bill and the manager brought over a free gelato (which was amazing).  It doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Reading West magazine this week was the story about this newest restaurant in downtown Oakville and my Bride and I decided to try something new.   We had a 6pm reservation. The place was full by 7:30pm on a Saturday.   From the moment you are greeted ( thanks Karen) it's a place you want to stay. The decor is nicely done. The staff is quite knowledgeable and very friendly and the food simply stated, is very good.   My wife ordered the salmon and it was cooked to her liking although I didn't see couscous on her plate. Regardless, I tasted it all and it was perfect.   I ordered the Foie Gras appetizer and it was splendid paired with the suggested Pinot noir. Then came the duck that was truly extraordinary. I don't think I've had a better duck breast entree in over 20 years.   John Ross ( The Chef) donning a Jays cap, even took a few minutes to talk prior to the busy period. Super nice guy.   Our waiter Warren was super. He and all the others made the experience special.   Oakville deserves a great restaurant like this and I wouldn't be surprised it goes to the top of everyone's list of good places for dinner.   We are already planning to bring friends and family soon.   Wishing them great success. They clearly know what they're doing here and it shows."}
{"text":"So excited that a nice bistro has arrived downtown Oakville!  Warm welcome by the hostess who took our coats and seated us.  The place was approx 3/4 full, not too noisy.  Warm decor with dark wood tables and neutral colour scheme.  Our server offered us water and gave us time to peruse the menu.  Good variety to please most palates.  Ordered the daily soup - roasted tomato and the organic salad to start.  Both starters were delish.   Fresh salad greens with pear and goat cheese and big chunks of walnuts.  Wine and old fashioned were both good.  Chicken and mushroom gnocchi and lobster fettuccine for mains.  The gnocchi was the star with light fluffy dumplings that had been browned so they were crispy and a creamy funghi sauce with chicken.  The lobster fettuccine was ok.  For the price $32 I expected actual chunks of lobster but it was more of a ragout of tomatoes and bits of lobster.  Fettuccine was cooked perfectly but not nearly as good as that gnocchi.  Desserts were the baklava cheesecake and chocolate mousse.  Both were okay as  I've had a better quality mousse elsewhere.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Our server forget to bring the sugar for my cappuccino and we had to ask someone else to bring it.  Same server had to be asked to top up our sparkling water.  I do expect service with a bit more finesse but those are things that are easily fixed.  The evening ended with coat check confusion.  We had a tag, he hands us one set of coats, nope not ours, tries again, nope still not ours, 3rd time's the charm.  Thanked him for showing us the contents of the closet .    Definitely worth a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"In the middle of the week, I went to Noble Bistro as a surprise dinner. The restaurant was practically empty. It is a big restaurant with simple wooden decors with few arts on the wall. When I was reading the menu... I couldn't figure out what type cuisine this restaurant offers. When our waiter came, my yelping mode came out. I started to ask questions about this place.   Information: Their cuisine is Chef inspired Farm to Fork cuisine, and chef of this restaurant JohnRoss Woodland, who is named one of the best 30 chefs under 30 in Chopped Canada. Impressive!!!  The waiter was impressed with my inquiries, so he offered a tasting menu and each dish would be a surprise and he asked me if had any restrictions. I did have two restrictions, and he said no problem with it.   First, my beautiful looking appetizer comes with a white wine (based California); I get seared scallops with cauliflower purée mixed with wild mushrooms and asparagus. It was so delicious, i heard myself making noises ...hmmmm! Second, my main meal was Black Sea bass with black pasta, grape tomatoes and pesto purée. It was perfect portion and every single bite of dish was heaven; it came with another glass of wine (based New Zealand).Third, my exotic looking desert, deconstructed strawberry pistachio shortcake, on the side strawberry sorbet with limoncello; it was an absolute delight. Best of it, it wasn't too sweet. I just loved it.  What an awesome service we had! What a delicious surprise was this tasting menu. This place is a gem for Oakville residents!"}
{"text":"Had a really wonderful lunch at Noble Bistro. The atmosphere, the service and menu selection were all fantastic and the food was outstanding!  Each dish was delicious! We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for Valentines day. Menu was somewhat limited, especially the desert menu but items were very interesting. We had the cesar salad, lobster ravioli appetizer, pork belly appetizer, scallop with short rib main and halibut main. Very delicious but somewhat on the salty side. The pork belly was missing a step, very tasty and delicate but needed to be seared to really make it great. The waiter was good but I felt I wasn't fully heard for some reason. Maybe it was too busy on Valentines day but the room wasn't full as we went really early. Décor is refreshing and clean."}
{"text":"The best meal we've had in Oakville in years. Really tasty, creative dishes. Atmosphere and service were great. Visit this place!"}
{"text":"Very romantic and classy place, perfect for a special occasion. They have a fine selection of reds and whites. They also have a few cocktails although I would go for wine. The cocktail I ordered wasn't as great as I expected but since the food was pretty good, I didn't mind.   The service was impeccable. We started with lobster bisque and they gladly split it in two bowls for us. It was the special of the day and absolutely delicious. I ordered the gnocchi, again very good. My husband got the trout entree which wasn't bad either.   They aren't great for kids. They accept reservations. On weekends, you may need to call ahead and reserve, especially for big groups. I strongly recommend to order a few courses since the portions are slightly smaller than usual."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Arizona and just had the most amazing dinner!  Service was perfect, ambiance is casual but chic. Love love love the food!  We had the pasta dish, organic salad and I had a gluten free vegetarian meal they accommodated for me. Everything is made fresh daily. Thank you Noble Bistro"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend and decided to go here for my brothers birthday.  Everything was beautifully presented and they were SO delicious that I forgot to even take photos of them!!  The lobster linguini for starters was just the right amount and tasted not overly creamy and seasoning was delicate and perfect. Scallops were tender and sweet potato purée and pork belly sauce was a combination that I haven never tried before and my mouth had a pleasant surprise! We all ordered different desserts and every single one of them were tasty and not overly sweet.   Service was flawless and I would highly recommend this place and would suggest ordering the 3 course chefs plate (like omakasé). Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed"}
