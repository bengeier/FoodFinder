{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! I love ping pong so it was fun to go and play with my husband. Seemed a little bit expensive ($35/hour) but you can play for a half hour, which is only $17 (not bad). Kind of a clubby atmosphere - loud music (DJ) and low lighting, but it definitely gave off the aura of being trendy and for a younger crowd. We only had drinks there (kind of expensive, but it's Toronto), but our bartender, server, and all the employees there were very friendly. They also had a promo going on - a game of 'around the world' ping pong that anyone could play for free - so that was nice to get a little more bang for your buck while there. I would recommend it for groups of friends (this would drive the price down) and would be more fun for doubles, or rotating around players. Would LOVE to go back if I lived closer :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty fun - its a little confusing with so many tables right next to each other - you often get hit with a ball from a neighbouring table I found.

Your typical hipster joint - loud music, drinks that cost 5x what they do at lcbo and a huge cover+fees for every little thing. Really only good for parties - we rented two tables in a group of 6 and we all barely got to play and still paid an arm and a leg. you could probably buy a ping pong table at a garage sale for the cost of one trip to this establishment."}
{"text":"SPiN was a lot of fun! They also having amazing side snacks such as the smores (a must try!), homemade cinnamon donuts and bacon candy!"}
{"text":"We ended up at Spin after bowling on a rainy Saturday and I left with three balls in my shirt. No, I was not drunk, there were balls flying everywhere. 

Since it was our first time, we were placed in the corner with a bucket of balls and some paddles. The place was busy, the music was good but man oh man was it a sausage fest. 

HINT: If you are a single lady, go here for a drink and you might just meet someone. I'm not responsible if you meet a jerk mind you, that goes for any bar. 

We played boys against girls and as things do, balls started to fly everywhere in an aggressive fashion and nobody seemed to mind or care. It wasn't until we left that I realized that they put us in the newbie room. There were other rooms........

I would go back, it was pretty fun."}
{"text":"Went here for an office party and we all had an awesome time. It's a unique concept which makes it a great date or a fun outing with a friend. If you're a tourist, you should definitely check it out. I wouldn't go here regularly, as it's very pricey to play, but it's a great place to go once in a while to change it up from the regular bar scene. I found everyone to be very social and energetic, the bar staff were very friendly also."}
{"text":"We were headed to the F-Stop, right across from this beauty of an underground spot, when we realized, even though we had tickets for the event at this club, and had waited in the cold for over a half hour at the front of the line (just my boyfriend and I, dressed to the nines for NYE in Toronto), we weren't getting in any time soon. 

We decided on a whim to give the bar across the lane a try. What a spectacular choice! Spin was off the charts bumpin! 

The DJ was live and quirky, providing an incredible atmosphere for the entire crowd all night long! The drinks were reasonably priced for sure, coat-check was a free service, the security rocked, the staff and servers, all wonderful, and the crowd was truly fantastic! Young and hip, with this sense of ease and comfort, this accurately-lit venue, with their blue hazy lights, open-concept bar, lounge and table seats appropriately placed, and of course...PING PONG TABLES totally had my heart the moment I set foot inside. It's the coolest vibe ever! And guess what? No cover fee. It was absolutely free. In my opinion, it is ABSOLUTELY worth checking out. I know we'll most definitely definitely be coming back to Spin."}
{"text":"I enjoy ping pong and I like beer. SPiN combines both and I like the concept. The food is also very good. It's also dangerously close to the office. It's random and kinda neat that Susan Sarandon is a backer of this place."}
{"text":"We came by on a Friday night for a two-hour session of ping pong. With a group of around 10, there was always someone willing to get up to play. Most of the other tables were surrounded by people who were just \"lounging\" with beers in hand.

Beers: They have a decent selection that range from $5.75-ish to $7.30-ish. I liked the Czechvar, which is on the higher end. There were a few draft beers that I have not heard of before, but I'm no beer aficionado. Cocktails run around $10-$12.

Ball boys: No running around after balls that fly awry! There are a couple ball boys who collect the strays and refill your basket. Great feature!

Equipment: The tables, nets and floors were top notch. The paddles probably could be replaced more frequently.

Atmosphere: Weird lounging with a mix of people dressed for clubbing, work and something in-between. It felt like we were in someone's really big basement.

Price: It seemed a bit overpriced at $120 for two hours of table rental. Beers were fairly normal in price.

I'd go again if I really had a craving to play ping pong (probably unlikely) because the ball boy service is what makes the experience a step up. As a place to gather and drink....I think there are better options around."}
{"text":"Despite the casual dining concept, the service staff here are truly on the ball- literally. Not only are there servers responsible for taking orders and delivering food, but they also have a crew whose (potentially dangerous) task is to pick up and deliver back all the balls in the room. Our server for the night was an absolute doll and incredibly accommodating.  We began our adventure at one of the picnic tables, moved when it was our time to play, and then headed back to a table for more eats and drinks, and every time, she transported everything for us as we moved.  The kitchen was also accommodating in making sure we had at least a good start on our meal before our table was ready to play. In the 25 minutes we sat at our picnic table before our game, we received six savoury dishes, and had at least one drink each, and somehow never felt rushed or overwhelmed.
Speaking of drinks, the bar menu at SPiN feature about 14 international wine offerings (from $8-12/glass), approximately 12 local and imported beers by the bottle ($5.75) or can ($6.30) or draft, 7 fruit-forward cocktails ($10.60-15.50), and three 32 oz \"punch bowls\" ($54.50) to share.  Ha, and unless you want to forfeit your game due to an inability to hold yourself up (nevermind successfully hit a ball), you're going to want to share.  Over the course of the night, we sampled the Cucumber Margarita (Cazadores, Cucumber, Basil, $12.40), Hurricane (Bacardi Black & White, Passion Fruit, Pomegranate, $10.60), the Peach Pit (Bulleit, Peach, Vanilla, $12.40), the Bottom Heavy Bowl (Grey Goose Le Poire, Pinot Grigio, Pear, Raspberry, $54.50), and the iPunch (Tequila Tromba, Pomegranate, Smashed Blackberries, Agave, $54.50).  Of the single glass cocktails, the winner was the Peach Pit- it was sweet, fresh and aromatic without feeling cloying or artificial. The Hurricane was nicely balanced but not as addictive as the aforementioned, while the Margarita packed a serious tart punch.  I personally adore sour drinks, but do yourselves a favour and drink this one before any of the fruity sweet bevvies.  Speaking of punches, I loved the idea of the punch bowl, as it easily yielded 8-10 small glasses over the night. If you like a smoother, less sweet offering, then the Bottom Heavy would likely be the best choice, but for me it was all about the iPunch. It was tangy from the pomegranate, and sweet from the agave, and biting into a blackberry yielded a bit burst of tequila spiked juice. I definitely would come back with a group of thirsty friends for a bowl of punch alone.

And whenever I drink, food I usually soon to follow. Designed by Jon Lovett (whose instragram photos have been making me hungry for months now), the food menu focuses on local, sustainable ingredients, all prepared in house and served with playful flare.  Actually, throughout the night, Chef Lovett was gracious enough to pop by the table a number of times to deliver food himself. Appropriate for it's purpose (aka. to potentially be consumed one handed during a head-to-head ping-pong showdown), the menu is made up of 14 small plates meant for snacking and sharing.  To round everything out, one can also choose from 5 sandwiches, 4 awesome sounding desserts, and 2 salads (which probably should be reserved for the picnic tables. Working a paddle in one hand and a fork in the other may lead to some potentially dangerous accidents. Me hand-eye-coordination? Apparently, not so much).  Sticking to the small sharable type plates on the menu, over the course of the night we sampled:

 
Poppers- Jalapenos, Atlantic Rock Crab, Buttermilk Ranch Dip ($9)
A nicely balanced popper with some mild heat from the jalapenos, sweetness from the rock crab and a tangy kick from the cream cheese filling. I also liked that he used panko, which kept them much lighter than the typical stodgy bar-menu staple

Cast Iron Prawns- Inland Farmed Prawns, Old Bay, Garlic, Chives ($12)
If you're a garlic lover, you're going to love these. The prawns were really nicely cooked and seasoned well and tossed with a sweet vibrant garlic sauce just waiting for a good sop.  The standard white toast that accompanied probably wouldn't have been my first pick for a sauce-eating vessel, but in in pinch, it did the trick...."}
{"text":"Avid ping-pong player? Expert cocktail sipper with a big appetite for shmoozing? Always getting turned away from F-Stop? You're in luck, Spin is just next door. 

On the weekend this place is usually really busy and full of enthusiastic (drunk) folks losing balls, collecting balls - and working up the balls to buy you a drink.

If you're with a good crowd, you're probably going to have a solid night out filled with fun music and enough white man's overbite to go around. I've been there about three times now, never picking up a ping-pong racket (special name?), but still managing to have a fantastic night every time. 

The bathrooms can be a little gag reflex inducing, but hey, the grosser the bathroom, the better the night. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's not my thing. Maybe I'm old. But what did I think of SPiN?
I'm just not into the idea of sipping a drink while balls are flying left and right. I want an olive in my Martini, not a Ping Pong ball. I'm surprised I didn't get flash backs to all those cops chasing me and Halsey on the highway to San Diego.
SPiN was...
Turkey.
Turkey meat. Turkey skin. Turkey crap..."}
{"text":"For those of us who grew up in the 'burbs, with ping pong tables in our basements, this place is awesome!  It's a fun place to play ping pong, with an interesting selection of beers on tap.  They named two drinks after the episode of Entourage that takes place in Spin L.A., although one of those drinks has been removed from the menu.  The only reason not to give it five stars is that non-members cannot book a table in advance on the phone, and the tables tend to be booked if you show up late.

Your friends who grew up in the city, without basements, will not \"get it\", and will probably be weak ping-pong opponents."}
{"text":"If you don't know already, this spot is all about ping pong!

A great location for a group if don't like the poolhall but want to have an activity while drinking. And it's right downtown on King St! Lots of fun and friends get really competitive, with balls flying all over the place.

This place is always packed on the weekends (even some weeknights), so do make a reservation. It's funny that it's actually cheaper for walk-in customers BUT don't expect to ever get a table.

Drinks are okay, music is good with a proper DJ, good spot to pre-drink and have some fun!"}
{"text":"I've only come here for big group events where someone else is paying, as SPiN is just too expensive to be a regular indulgence.  Besides, I'm just not that into ping pong and some of the people who seem to come here are super competitive, which is both intimidating and kind of obnoxious.  Honestly, the vibe is really \"warehouse rave\"--there's no seating, just concrete floors and UV lighting (in the back room, anyway).  I'll probably go back on someone else's dime, but it'll never be my first choice."}
{"text":"It is expensive but a fun experience is guaranteed. Ping-pong in a bar! We had a b-day party with two tables booked.
Everyone had fun.
Gives strangers in your group a chance to mingle while playing ping-pong."}
{"text":"My work held a party here in November and it was a lot of fun. A section of the room was booked just for us and so I don't know what it looks like on a regular day. It is a great location for parties or just hanging out with friends.  I cannot comment on the food because I think my company catered but we had a tournament and the two hosts were fun and engaging. 

I will definitely come here with some friends another time."}
{"text":"SPiN is super fun! Went here with work; we ended our night here after 2 other places, so didn't get any food. However, we kept the drinks flowing...and it was glow in the dark night. Never has ping pong been so fun. Everyone's white shirts were very conspicuous and the ping pong balls glowed too. Would definitely revisit with some friends!"}
{"text":"Been to SPiN twice now, and def is the new spot to hang out in Toronto. It's neat, different and exciting. SPiN is a place where you can play ping-pong / table-tennis, enjoy great food and an amazing variety of beer. 

Its kind of hard to find, so i will help you guys out, the entrance is on the right hand side towards the back in the same building that has firkin on king.

The game: 

Awesome layout! as soon as you enter, the first section is where anyone can pick a table and star pinging. They also have the back side of this place that's usually booked out for corp parties. Also unlimited balls, so no need to worry if you aren't the greatest at the sport (yes it is considered a sport in may parts of the world). 

The food/Beer : 

Being vegetarian, I only tried the veggie burger so far, and it was different. They made a vege patty out of falafel mix, it was a good different. Some one having lunch a few seats down from me at the bar looked to be enjoying their food, and knowing I would come here and post this I had to ask. She had ordered something called a tiffin, it has three parts, bread, soup and salad. Here's the best all their food is served in Indian style metal cutlery. 

As for beer, they serve hop city, that's all you need to know, just kidding, they have an odd variety which is good cause i tired of the same crap. 

This place is awesome, love the music, the layout, the food, beer and of course the game!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to spend an evening with friends. Playing ping pong is a fun activity and their drinks are good. The music is alright, if your tastes are a bit outside the mainstream. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My boss took the whole team here last year in December, it's kinda like the end of year celebration, to motivate us work harder next year and thank us for our hard work for the past year. 

I have to say that I had fun here playing ping pong. Overall it's a good experience. But I think the snack here is totall over priced. I had a few drinks and some snacks just like everyone else in the team and for the 2 hours we spent here, I heard my boss ended up paying over 500 bucks, we only had 2 tables and i think the rate for playing pingpong is reasonable. I blamed the overpriced snacks.

I am just happy that I'm not the person that's paying."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me on a date night here for some ping-pong fun. I must say, I am not am avid ping-pong player...this was actually my first time playing ever!

It is very quaint, dark, evening type atmosphere with a bar, had an industrial style. Their appetizers were delicious (although pricey). We ordered the prawn sliders and the falafel sliders. The prawn ones were soooo good!

The service was quick, the wait was not long at all to get our ping pong table or for the food. The place is pretty large (can accommodate large groups). It also seemed like you could book party rooms that are somewhat separate for your party.

Overall, we had a great time, we paid for one hour of ping-pong, had some food, no drinks (we both don't drink). Nobody bothered us, there wasn't anyone annoying or loud nearby. So our experience was pleasant and we would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"SPiN is a great place to catch up with friends over a casual game of table tennis while drinking Sangrias or other alcoholic beverages. 

The food looks great but the dishes end up being either mediocre or sub-par. The mini macs had a pretty convincing imitation Mac sauce but the burger meat was dry and flavourless.  Despite having a delicious garlic aioli sauce accompanying the tator tots, the tots themselves could have had a crispier shell.  

Avoid the food but stay for the company."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday party and was oh so pleasantly surprised. Ping pong? On your 21st birthday? I went with it. It was awesome. 

We had two tables reserved on a Friday night from 11-close. Checking in was seamless and it was good space to accomodate our large group. It was great to have some seating to put your bags and jackets on but I wished for more. Perhaps that would have encouraged more lounging because otherwise, we're all just standing around.

I had a delicious cesar that had a spicy kick and ton of accoutrements. Served out of mason jar, I had no complaints except for the steep price. Lower it a dollar or two and you would have had me coming back for seconds, maybe even thirds! 

All in all, a unique concept that is excellently executed. Our ball basket was always fully stocked and it was a great way to spend some time among friends. I love playing ping pong with abandon."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun, the 60's soul / R&B sets the vibe, beers are cheap, food is unbelievable, and the wait staff are super friendly. 

Food: the best Chicken & Waffles in the city, hands down. It's like a sweet soul kitchen in there. Everything is apparently made from scratch, soft baked pretzels? so fresh, bourbon popcorn? crammed way to much into my face. You are literally doing yourself a disservice if you are not ordering food when you come. 

Dranks: $5.75 pints? on King West? are you kidding me? also, get the punch bowl to kick it up a notch, i don't know what the bartenders are doing back there, but it definitely does the trick. 

A lot of reviewers are moaning about the price per table, I didn't find it expensive, factor in the free coat check, and cheap drinks then tell me about the price. Seriously, split that with a few friends and its cheaper (and more entertaining) than going to the movies. 

If you're looking for a different type of scene on King West with a relaxed vibe, this is your place."}
{"text":"Such a fun night out here. This is all about ping pong. Don't be fooled by the outside, inside this place is very spacious. It's great for a night out with a group of friends. Sure you could go bowling but why not try something new and interesting. It's always busy and always full of laughs and memories."}
{"text":"alright m coming soon again! came with one of my friends when i was a visitor to Toronto. Couldn't get into the nightclub opposite it, hence ended up going to Spin. Was something different! Beer n ping pong! awesome idea :)"}
{"text":"Fun, 
great idea

Expensive per the hour comparing to other big cities.

Music was very good.
Lighting was though for playing.
But Ping pong balls unlimited!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about SPiN before coming here but was still surprised by how great it was. The ping pong was pretty much what I expected (a blast) but what I wasn't expecting was for the food to be so delicious. The online menu is deceiving in that it sounds like typical mass produced bar food but its entirely not. Jalapeño poppers were made from fresh jalapeños, and even the chips and dip were made with fresh-baked flour chips. From looking online, I thought all the drinks were going to be at least $10 but draft beer and mixed drinks were just $6-$7. The night ended up being way cheaper and way better than I expected!

Also I was afraid we wouldn't have ample seating to have a full meal but the place doesn't start getting packed til around 9pm, so if you're going earlier than that, shouldn't be a problem to find somewhere to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Cool place! Good music, vibes, setting, drink menu, and such a blast to play ping pong in this setting with ur friends! Would come back again! Havent tried the food yet."}
{"text":"SPiN Toronto is one of the newest and most exciting additions to Toronto. SPiN is a ping-pong social club - a place to play the game, meet new people, have a few drinks (and great food as well).

Ping-pong no longer needs to be confined to your uncle's dark basement - SPiN is a more like bar/lounge meets table tennis dojo. Sip back a variety of local, import and micro-brews while challenging you friends to a game (or 3). Full bar and menu means that SPiN is a place you can stay for quite a long time.

The minute I heard SPiN was coming to Toronto I joined the club and made sure I kept my ear to the ground for it to open. It is now open (yay!) and the grand opening event is scheduled to be sometime in October. For members the club will offer tournaments, ladders, clinics and other benefits. For non-members - you can still play, just show up and request a table (I think I counted 12 tables total).  SPiN is open to the public!

Overall SPiN is a great time out! A funky/cool atmosphere, great drinks and food and ping-pong! What more can someone ask for?

I think SPiN is my new hang-out. I'm not that good at ping-pong (yet) but I'll be on the pro circuit in no time."}
{"text":"It is a really cool place even if you don't like ping pong. The food is kind of pricey, $9 for a pizza pocket and $17 for two cans of PBR. But if you just plan on playing pool and going someplace elsewhere then it's fine. You also have to book the tables in advance I believe. But double check"}
{"text":"The staff here are great, the food is crazy overpriced, and the crowd is unpredictable. I believe some celebrities frequent this place somewhat, as evidenced by my friends run ins/pictures. The concept is fun and will definitely be returning, although definitely not  to eat."}
{"text":"A Saturday night out started here and with the serious amount of fun we were having ended here too.

I am not a big fan of ping pong, even having a table here in my office, I have yet to feel the urge to pick up a paddle and play. However put drink in the equation and I am all up for getting massively involved.

So its a Saturday night so of course we had to wait for a table to free up, honestly since my friend was doing all the chatting at the front I am not even sure if he had to pay to reserve or what they told him but we chilled at the bar for an hour until we got summoned.

The crowd, okay a mix of total douches - imagine baseball caps and even one guy wearing a wife beater vest and another wearing those plastic knuckle duster rings that only the most biggest douche would pay money for. 
The chicks were dressed up too so it made me wonder whether this was there plan B after going to the shitty F-stop opposite and coming right back out. 

The service in general was good, apart from 'top button buttoned up comb over boy' who didn't seem to want to move outside of his end of the bar regardless of the amount of people waiting.
By the time I asked for the food menu it was our turn on the tables so we continue with the liquid diet.

Playing ping pong when drunk is the only time I can ever imagine doing so, but its serious fun and even though the balls we hit were usually hitting other people and tables nobody seemed to mind. 

I know between four of us having had four rounds of rum and cokes and the table for an hour the bill came to $135 and that seemed pretty decent to me."}
{"text":"came here after many times of saying no - only because I've never played ping pong.

we took the $20 for a 30 mins option over the $40 for an hour.

it was fun because it wasn't busy and we were being goofy but i don't know how I'd feel returning on a busy night having people watching."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great staff, great time!

Planning a work event here couldn't have been any easier. At first, some of my group were skeptical about planning a party for 40 here. With just a couple tables for our reservation, it seemed like it could be difficult for everyone to be engaged and we worried it could get expensive.

But from the first time I emailed about event, Spin made it super easy for us so we took the chance. 

The event coordinator was fantastic, helpful, and very patient when my superiors made it tough to get decisions and answers to her in time. Right down to 15 minutes before we arrived, she remained patient and friendly and did whatever she could to help me make it easy and within our budget.

We had the lounge plus two tables and it worked out great! We organized our own tournament in two of the tables (but you can add a service where they do this work for you) and used the lounge table for practice. We had a great server dedicated to our group and the catered food was a big hit.

Not many from our group had been before, but everyone had a great time and started talking about \"next time.\" 

I've been once before on a whim on a Friday night and from both experiences, it was clear that the staff all share one goal: to make sure you're having a blast."}
{"text":"Pour les pongistes et amateurs de bière! C'est une combinaison peu banale mais je pense que le concept mérite à être importé en France. Prenez une douzaine de tables de ping pong, un bar, et mettez un peu partout des employés équipés de filet pour ramasser les balles et c'est parti!
La clientèle est très diverse : entre cols blancs, jeunes et bobos voulant s'adonner à un sport tendance.
Curiosité à essayer si vous êtes à Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised by the food here. I came for a corporate event and did not expect the food to be as good as it was. Really enjoyed everything - sadly was only able to take one picture."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a birthday party and based on other reviews I think we lucked out because there was only one table of douches and they left early. The crowd that night felt more like university students. The kind who don't wear Birkenstocks but at the same time aren't sexy enough to be hitting the club scene. 

Our party ordered a lot of food and while the prices aren't uni-student friendly, I feel they're at par with the neighbourhood. We tried a bunch of appetizers and the only item I didn't love was the charcuterie board ($18) because it was mainly toast and crackers with not much meat or cheese. 

Overall this place had a fun atmosphere, kinda reminiscent of your childhood friend's dad's basement but cooler. They have black lights above each table so wear white for fun. And unlike other King West establishments, you can actually sit down on couches without having to shell out moolah for bottle service."}
{"text":"As an avid ping pong player and aficionado this is one of my favourite venues in the city, on 3rd thought it just might be my absolute favourite.  A few years back I visited SPiN NYC and was blown away by the concept of a ping pong social club. Ever since the TO location opened up I have been nearly weekly. 

It is important to know the rates before visiting SPiN, see below for the details. 

Walk-In Rates Before 5pm

General Public:
$20 per hour
$10 per half hour

Member Rate:
$10 per hour
$5 per half hour
Walk-In Rates After 5pm

General Public:
$28 per hour
$14 per half hour

Member Rate:
$14 per hour
$7 per half hour

So let's say you walk into SPiN with a buddy on a Tuesday night and get a table, you're looking at $28/hr which some may find it expensive. However, for the ambiance, atmosphere, chic design and notion that you never have to pick your balls up off the floor, other may find it attractive. I am one of those guys. 

If you are a ping pong lover this will be your Neverland. There is a bar with both domestic and import beers on tap, various cocktails and solid grub to hold you over and great for sharing. 

Be forewarned, trying to walk into SPiN Thurs-Sat in the evening looking for a table is almost impossible. Unless you are a member I highly recommend going before 5pm to take advantage of the special rates, or on Mon, Tues, Wed & Sunday evenings. I also always call ahead to make sure the venue is not rented out for any corporate events, of which they host many. 

6/5 for me."}
{"text":"I recently attended a work function here and had a good time. I never really played much ping pong but enjoyed playing. The real surprise came from the better than average food, excellent service and a few good beer options. 

One question - Is it a bad sign if you work up a sweat playing ping pong?????? 

Spin is massive with too many tables to count. I love the fact that they give you a bucket of balls so you don't have to chase your single ball around all night. People actually have a job there picking up stray balls with a cool sweeping contraption. 

Spin appeals to a broad audience so expect a mixed crowd. There were a number of \"suit\" office events, students, people on dates and die hard ping pong players (and a few dressed the part).  They have a lounge area you can reserve for larger parties but it only comes with one ping pong table. 

Service was a real standout - everyone was friendly, they were quick to bring out food and very efficient servicing a large number of customers at the bar.

We ordered a number of appetizers for our party and they were surprisingly good. I loved the Philly cheese steak - a skewer with beef, green peppers and warm cheese. Pulled Pork sliders were also a standout.  Mixed feelings about the jalapeno corn bread.  We also ordered multiple cheese, veggie and fruit plates which were all a hit. 

Not a huge drink selection but sufficient. They had Blanche du Chambly in bottle and one or two German beers on tap. They served 5 wine options in either red or white and a number of cocktails.    

I expected to hate this evening but it was very much the opposite. Good food, drinks for all tastes, the huge space ensures no overcrowding and competitive fun for all.

PS - Expect to be hit with flying ping pong balls 184 times per visit.... but they don't hurt.

BK"}
{"text":"Came here a few time now. This place is pretty awesome. Ping pong and drinks (mainly). It's probably best bet to make a reservation ahead of time rather than just showing up and hoping for the best. 

They also have some shareable plates which are pretty good. 

The staff there do their best to keep the floors balls free!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, but a bit on the expensive side.  Food is also not bad, but again, a bit on the expensive side...

I guess if you don't mind spending a little bit, it's a great place to hang out!  They're always busy with corporate events too.  Make sure you book ahead of time if possible.  But they only let members book way ahead..."}
{"text":"I ventured to SPiN with a few friendly co-workers over a lunch hour for one of their birthday's. This adventure sure did beat the stuffy sit down lunch scenerio. Having just recently opened you would never know it. It was a bit of a slower lunch, but everyone was very one the ball (no pun intended). 

The whole concept is to play some Table Tennis while enjoying lunch. Pretty awesome idea. We played a few rounds and then I enjoyed some Grilled Cheese with Tomato soup (very comfort for the cold winters coming). We also tried the pretzels, the onion strings and my co-workers enjoyed sliders and the veggie burger. It was all very simply well done. 

I feel as though this place will only keep growing as the concept keeps building and the word gets out. It will be a great late night hang out ... at a price. During the day to rent a table for an hour is $20, at night it's $28.. not the cheapest evening out amongst friends but perhaps a great special occasion local or even a pre-drink scenerio."}
{"text":"Spin is a great place with a nice vibe and perfect to kick back for a few games of ping pong and have a beer on the side.  We came here on a Sunday night and there was a bit of a wait for a table, but it was expected on a weekend.

Definitely a different atmosphere than your typical pool hall and it would be nice if there were more pub games such as pool, foosball and darts.  Overall a nice place to hang out for a couple of drinks and play some good ole ping pong with friends.  Very friendly bartenders and service is quick!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday so it was pretty slow so take this review w a grain of salt. First of all everyone who works he is super good looking and seemed to flirt with each other the entire time and not be too chatty.. But it was a slow Sunday so no worries. It seems like the typical king west crowd would come here but I do love that it's a ping pong bar it's a fun new idea. They play fun music here so I would like to come back and check me out on a busier night.. Maybe a fri or sat.. But duely note it's super easy to reserve a table on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"It's a fun night out in the city! 

We stopped by here one night, completely unplanned. Originally we were headed to a club, but since most of them had lineups, we stumbled across spin and decided to try it out for some ping pong fun. We managed to grab a room and paid for an hour, which was reasonably priced. They provide you with racquets and balls - so many balls, so you don't need to worry about that. There's music, drinks, and tables everywhere - definitely not how we planned to spend the night, but ended up being an awesome night out! 

Overall, I would recommend SPiN to a friend - especially those who are competitive with sports and love to drink and dance!"}
{"text":"I have hosted many of my company events at spin and have always has a great time. We always booked the back half for our events with an open bar and appetizers. The food is typical bar food with a twist and it's always a fun time."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest bars EVER! You could pretty much spend a whole evening here and continue to enjoy yourself throughout the night.

The wait times here are pretty ridiculous if you come on any weekend, but it wasn't too bad overall. We ended up leaving at one point for some food, but we got a call for a table within 2 hours on a Saturday night without reservations. Note: make a reservation if you're coming on a weekend. They charge per hour, so you can stay as long as you want!

With ping pong balls bouncing EVERYWHERE, this gave an interesting environment. A huge space with 12 tables in total, and a bar right in the middle. They had all sorts of beers and a special for tall boys too!

They had staff constantly going around to pick up balls in an interesting badminton net ball-picker-upper contraption which was probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen. They got the balls, then deposited them into the basket for those playing at the tables! You never have to go and chase your balls!

An awesome night, even though we didn't get to play. Definitely coming back again to whack some balls with a paddle!"}
{"text":"We went there with a group of 18 people early evening. I don't have any other similar places to compare SPIN to but to many of us the rental price for the ping pong tables seemed overpriced with $55/h. 
Also, we ordered a share platter from their menu and it was a ridiculously small portion for the price we paid. So we had half a chicken (it was just a few small pieces chicken breast and two wings or so), with some fries, gravy and two buns and they charged and still do $50(!) for that! None of us could believe it and thought it was highway robbery.
The evening was fun but I wouldn't go there to enjoy their overpriced, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Cool spot but hard to get a table unless you reserve ahead of time! Tables are also not very cheap."}
{"text":"Good fun. We did a walk in without problem of getting a table for 2pm. There are 12 tables at $15 for an hour so not bad if split in half or 4 ways. We had a few beers as well as food. The quality of food isn't of the greatest I'm afraid so we won't be going back to eat. All in all the experience and atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I freaking SUCK at ping pong.

Moral of this post: I freaking LOVE this place.

SPiN is a bizarre combo of fight club meets an alcoholic, pro-ping pong ballers wet dream. Although I don't believe I belong to any of the groups mentioned above, I do love coming to this place. 

Their food is great, the constant flow of ping pong balls is amusing, and the Ceasers are to die for... Did I mention they rim them with spicy Dorito rimmer? (What is that you might ask? Only the greatest thing your arteries will love-hate).

If you're looking for something different, or even just looking for a sweet place to hang out with your friends (while either showing off or making a fool of yourself) this is a great place.

Highly recommend booking a table in advance (to show your friends you know whats up), or wearing white (there's black lights, so you might as well want to be the brightest thing in their underground club)."}
{"text":"Ping pong and liquor?... Sign me up.

Looks a little shady from outside, but from inside the decor is modern and there are plenty of ping pong tables. Lounge was packed and everyone was playing.

Watch your steps and be careful not to step on the balls."}
{"text":"I made my husband his 30th birthday party here and it was a great experience.  I booked the lounge and one extra court to accommodate about 40 guests.  

SPiN was great to deal with in terms of sorting out booking logistics.  They helped me decide the amount of courts to book given the intended size of our party.  They allowed me to bring in my own cake and they served it to our guests and agreed to waive the cutting fee.  I also brought balloons a few hours before guests arrived and they allowed me to store them.  The wait staff were great about circulating the cake to our guests and cleaning up once the plates were left behind in the lounge.  The bartenders and waiters were also very attentive to our party's needs throughout the evening.

Our friends really enjoyed the service, ping pong and the music!  I would definitely recommend SPiN for another party.

They are also a peanut free facility."}
{"text":"Been to Spin a few times now and it's always been a great time! 

This time hosted a corporate event here on very short notice for 50 people. Dealt with Jordyn, who ensured that the event was a success. 

When we got to Spin, the team was excellent in setting us up for the event and catering food and drinks. 
The grilled cheese, chicken meatballs, tuna poke and sangria got great reviews. 

Everyone had a great time! Would definitely recommend! 

Overall, great atmosphere, decent food/drinks, good space and great service!"}
{"text":"I got invited for a product launch party from work at SPiN. 

Have been there a couple of times already, so the place is not new to me. You can play ping pong/ table tennis on minimum  12 tables that I counted on site or just chill out at the bar. You can either play a tournament amongst your friends or just hit the ball for fun. 

They have a basket of balls nearby and you don't have to pick up any fallen balls as people around quickly \"sweep\" them. The only complaint I have is there are spots that are too dark and the spots that are lighted are dim, particularly when you first enter. You have to get used to the lights. Perfect for a bar or lounge, but not as much for playing and chatting with people around.  

The food served was good - on a platter all finger foods. There was a small sign in each of the picnic table where the food was, but sometimes difficult to read and also which dishes which were which. Two dips in platters and one had dairy and one did not. 

But a good experience overall as the staff were helpful."}
{"text":"If you want to get semi-dressed up to go to an underground ping-pong bar, Spin is where you might want to show your face. You don't have to dress up in your Sunday best but dressing up (not just for Spin but also the surrounding bars and restaurants) might help you fit in a little better.

My cousins and I didn't because we didn't give two shits about hooking up with anyone there. So we ordered our beers, played a few rounds of expensive ping-pong, then walked out down the street to another bar that fit our personalities a little more (i.e. Horseshoe Tavern and Odd Seoul).

Good place to bring a date and lose (on purpose) or for a group of office buddies to come down to relax and have fun. I may or may not come back here if I were in Toronto if I remember to bring nicer clothes.

Oh yeah, beers are expensive here. So is the ping-pong time. If you're only interested in playing ping-pong, you might be better off finding a Chinese friend who might have one in their basement.

Parking: Limited paid street parking
Price: $$
Wait: None for drinks, reserve tables in advance or wait a long, long time"}
{"text":"SPiN is a really cool and unpretentious space. the vibe is very laid back and the service is 110% awesome. We checked in since we are having a corporate function there.

A few interesting beers. If you like a light beer, cracked canoe was awesome.

Tried the fries, sauce was good but I wasnt blown away by them. Try the ribs, they are beef so bigger than a \"regular\" pork rib. comes with 3 and heavily sauce with a creamy blue cheese dip - very yum.

So come on down and get your Pong on! Even if you can't play they have ball boys who will pick up after you with their nifty badmonton racquet ball picker-upper.

Until next time, I hope you Ping before you Pong and that you never hold too many balls at one time."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how much fun we had at Spin Toronto last night.

The staff were all helpful, friendly and cheerful, especially our Aussie server Ben and other lady server whose name I never learnt. While some of the fellas looked a little glum (probably because they had to pick up balls off the floor all night while the ladies did the serving!) but not Biniman who was skipping about whipping ping pong balls into his specially made net with a giant smile on his face.

Apart from the fact my friend beat me at Ping Pong we will definitely be back (most likely for a rematch!)

Keep it up Spinners!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  All I have to say is you gotta go and try it out for yourself.  I mean seriously....who doesn't like 1. Ping Pong and 2. Booze....

Great concept.....love this place."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend for a friends going away party. I would certainly go back. There is something fun about trying to keep track of a small bouncing ball after having a few drinks :-). 

They serve drinks in this little jar shaped glasses which I absolutely loved. Drinks are cheaper than any other joint on this strip. Bar service is quick and friendly, Free coat check is a bonus. 

There is always ample amount of balls around, thanks to the ball bus boys. There is enough space between and around tables. And there are benches all over the place, but nothing if you want/need a comfortable place to lounge. 

Worth an experience."}
{"text":"This is a fun concept for someone who is never been it's a lounge/bar with ping-pong tables everywhere and it gets quite busy we went in around midnight and were able to get a table around 1 AM after we put our name on the waitlist. It costs $20 for every half hour and $40 for the full hour. 
They have loud throwback music playing and there's drinks flowing everywhere and there's never any shortage of ping-pong balls because they keep replacing your baskets. 

It's a fun concept but definitely gets packed so if you want to make sure you get a table you have to make a reservation in advance which can be a little pricier! 

 I wish they had more places to sit and more couch areas so that those who are not able to play can still at least enjoy their drinks and hang out"}
{"text":"I came here for a girlfriends birthday and it was fun but I would never order food from this place!!!! We ordered the chicken platter to share, the fries were way to salty the chicken had no flavor nor did the gravy it just looked like goo for $50.00 I would have rather order Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"Who knew that ping pong and drinks went well together like peanut butter and jelly?

My cousin and some pals went out for dinner at Marben and we decided to go along King Street for after-dinner drinks. As we were walking along King Street, we saw the sign for SPiN and decided to play some ping pong. I came here a while back for a Yelp Event and had a lot of fun; my other pal had also recently come here with work colleagues and she had an awesome time as well. For a Friday night it was quite busy, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. It was $15 for 30 minutes - we were a group a four so it turned out to be quite reasonable. While we played ping pong, we also enjoyed SPiN's cocktails - for $10, you get a mason jar - not too shabby. It's a cool concept and my cousin (visiting Toronto) enjoyed herself. Where else can you drink and burn the cals at the same time?

Good for: out-of-towners, groups"}
{"text":"This place seems pretty cool. I ended up here after a long and random night. I didn't know such a place existed. Of course there are ping pong tables but I don't know that much playing of ping pong was happening. Most of the balls seemed to just be flying around randomly but it looked like all the players were having a good bit of fun. I think I found beer for around $6.50, not bad considering the area. The staff seemed really great. Several staff members struck up random conversations with me as they were collecting balls or whatever they do. The atmosphere was a little chaotic toward the en of the night, but if you're looking for a place where you can get dressed up, drink and mingle, and play around like a big kid, then you'll like it here. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Instead of watching TV to distract you from your drinks, why not play ping pong?

A great concept, no cleanup as you are given a bottomless bucket of ping pong balls... well, until you're done playing... and the prices end up being reasonable the more people you have with you.

It is an open place and there is the chance that you can be hit by a stray ping pong ball if you're not careful but it's not like a ping pong ball ever hurt anyone right?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun night in the City of Toronto, Spin is the place to be. It's so lively and full of music and people when you walk in. You will also see several ping pong tables, booze and balls flying at you when you walk in. A group of us decided to book a table here for a Friday evening. I think it worked out to about $5 per person for a group of about 10 which wasn't too bad for about an hour of ping pong. If you think you are a good ping pong player, think again. It gets quite interesting how your skills gets progressively worst as you drink and play ping pong throughout the night. Drinks are pretty standard pricing for bars along King St. Overall, a fun night out at Spin with friends, some fun ping pong and of course good drinks to start the weekend!!"}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere. Great place to catch up with friends, have a drink, and eat some yummy food. The only problem I have is the price. Which is north of what I'm willing to pay. Other than that it's wicked fun."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great spot to have some fun or try something different. They had great beers on tap, and tons of ping pong balls. 
Pros: great social experience and atmosphere. Fun times mastering ping pong while having some drinks. You'll  never have to chase down a ping pong balls since the basket is always stocked.
Cons: if you are above average and really want an intense game of ping pong, weekend nights aren't the best idea. Lot of people in your way and restricted space. I believe it's a bit overpriced to rent a table. It was like $62 for an hour. But then again, it's in the heart ofToronto and the place is huge... lease = 
$$$$$"}
{"text":"Venue: SPiN Tornto
Specialty: Ping-pong, cocktails and Bites
Menu items: Cured Trout, Pretzels, Chicken and Waffles, Winter Shortcake and Gin Blossom cocktail

Imagine a 12,000 sqt of retail space dedicated only to ping-pong tables, cocktails and good food. Well, that is exactly what the famous Susan Sarandon, yes the same one from The God Father and Stepmom, with fellow investors envisioned when creating this chain of ping-pong club locations across the globe.

SPiN Galactic, home of all things ping-pong, hides in an alleyway just west of the Spadina and King street intersection in downtown Toronto. The club boasts 2 fully licensed bars, 12 ping-pong tables, a cocktail menu, a full food menu, a lounge and a private party room. Memberships are available for the more obsessed players, but walk-ins are always welcomed and the prices are decent if you are in for a night of drinks, food, socializing and fun.

Asides from the great entertainment value of beating and defeating a friend on a ping-pong table, or even watching a pro tournament right next to you; the drinks and the food at SPiN Toronto lure crowds in with great force. With a new food menu recently launched by Executive Chef Jon Lovett, this venue is hitting all great marks when it comes to tingling one's palate. With locally sourced ingredients, and homemade sauces and breads, this menu is one that adjacent restaurants on the King West strip should watch out for.

The Chicken & Waffles, is my favourite dish at this ping-pong club. A roasted board of king capon chicken with stuffing, wafflees, pumpkin and cranberry sauce bring the perfect entertainment value to any hungry player. If you are more into finger foods, the Pretzels are the perfect way to play and eat, and then play some more. Using the chef's original recipe with spices, these doughie goods come ready to dip in a warm cheese sauce - a perfect and filing savory ensemble. And if you are more into the sweet stuff, SPiN offers a delicious and decadent Winter Shortcake that is made with buttermilk biscuits, fruit preserves and cream and topped with mint.

The night is not a night without trying SPiN Toronto's Ryan Dzoic's cocktail list. This is an area where SPiN outshines many fellow bars across the King strip. With cocktails that are carefully crafted and mixed, innovative ideas like freezing edible flowers on ice and using it as ice-cubes on drinks, and even testing with ingredients like homemade syrups, maraschino cherries and specialty rums.

But the very best part about SPiN its is ball pick-up method - players are given a basket of balls for play and staff move around to collect the wayward shots. No need to bend down after you indulge in all this food! Now that is what I call a well-rounded service.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"One important caveat on my review for SPiN is that I don't actually remember a bloody thing about it. Okay, I have a few, very vague impressions. But it was part of my bachelor party weekend, so cut me some slack?

Now in all honesty, I wasn't super-keen about the prospect of going to a Ping Pong Parlor as part of the bachelor party, seeing as I figured I'd be pretty tipsy after a Jays game, drinks and dinner (I was right). Combine that with the fact that I don't think I have ever played ping pong for more than eight seconds and you're looking at potential embarrassment and/ or injury. Thankfully, I avoided both and actually acquitted myself quite well, finishing a very respectable third in our round robin tournament. This leads me to believe either that my friends are not the most athletic and coordinated bunch (a possibility) or that I'm just a wonderfully gifted natural athlete whose skills are only magnified by copious consumption of liquor (I'm leaning towards this explanation). 

Anyhow, the place was a lot of fun, more than I really expected. Well laid out, lots of tables, good service (from what I can remember) and fun times. Probably prudent to make a reservation but I really don't know. Still, give it a go even if you're a novice and remember that beer makes ping pong more fun!"}
{"text":"SPiN is a ping pong bar with loads of tables for the playing and every so often they turn the lights out so it is glow in the dark laser style ping pong. Worth a visit for sure.

In general SPiN is an alright place but it is super expensive to book tables so I pretty much only go here when there is an event on which is a shame as I would go way more often if it was more affordable. Gotta love a good game of ping pong. The other thing that kinda gets me about this place is that I'd like a slightly more delicious drinks menu. 

I will give the crew good points for having lots of charitable events there, they are awesome at that. Great staff too."}
{"text":"Looking for a cool hangout spot and you're done with the whole pool hall and darts thing? Then maybe it's time for some ping pong. (Note: I had the pleasure of visiting this place during a Yelp Elite event.)

Spin Galactic's angle is definitely being an activity-orientated place where you and your friends can gather from some food and drink. The main focus, of course, is the ping pong and it dresses it up with a lively background and some black lights.

While you can play ping pong in your friend's basement, it's not the same. Spin has a staff of retrievers who make your balls their business. Any missed shot or errant ball is gathered by staff and eventually returned into a bucket by your table. Taking away the need to retrieve a ping pong ball after a failed return adds a big layer of enjoyment to playing. It keeps the rhythm going and adds a considerable value to the hourly rate for the table.

There are better food and drink elsewhere, but nowhere else has ping pong like this."}
{"text":"Great place to go after a night out in King West. If you are looking for an alternative to over-priced martinis or a dive bar on a weekend out with friends, why not ping pong with alcohol?! great venue, spacious and great crowd. Can get a bit pretentious but this is King West after all."}
{"text":"I start my February food-free challenge with the ultimate SPIN GALACTIC only because I've come to realize that the LCBO doesn't qualify and I'm not sure if a yelp event involving food counts either. So I will really base my review on my two experiences I had ping ponging it up in the newest night life activity in the city of Toronto.

I think that ping pong tables speak for themselves. If you play and have people who want to play with you, I don't see how you couldn't give it 5 stars... but I'm talking about the establishment, the overall business and I have to say that it is lucky to be getting 3 stars at all. On two occasions, my experience was meh, although favoured towards me as the end result so I guess they will get that extra A-OK from me.

Experience 1 - came for a friend's birthday knowing that we were going to get the private room, only to get the call 2 hours before the event that they were double booked.... no they weren't - apparently, the Maple leafs players were going to show up later in the night so they moved our party out. As a result, I ended up playing underneath a leaking pipe. The manager propped a cup in between the dripping to prevent it from getting it on the table or the floor, but I really consider it a safety hazard, and increased no-fun points because the ball was splashing water every time it hit the table.

Experience 2 - finding out that I am getting charged $60 an hour for a table just to RESERVE  a table!!!!!! If you walk in to play for an hour, it's $28,  but if you want to secure your spot, that's double your money. I think that's a little too rich for my money. They are already making so much money off of food and drinks. Unless you get a huge group of people who won't get that much playing time, it would cost a fair amount just to have 60 minutes of play time. 

I think they attract the corporate events at this place, which I totally give them kudos for. But I can buy a ping pong table for $100 and play until the cows come home.

I think this place is awesome, but just things that seem a little unreasonable. that's just my take. Now I wish I had more money :("}
{"text":"A full service bar loaded with ping pong tables makes for an amazing place for social gatherings.  It is important to note that it is a good idea to reserve a table before arriving; we didn't, and were unfortunately unable to get a table on which to play.

The food menu is pretty comprehensive as far as bar-ish food goes with everything from oysters, to grilled cheese, to milk and cookies.  The energy in here was good, and the crowd was fun.  Definitely worth checking out next time you're in the King West area.

ps. Cracked Canoe on tap is a must."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of coming to this place for a recent birthday. Once I heard it was around the King and Portland area on a Friday night all I could think about was drunken 20 year olds all up in my grill. Plus I really suck at ping-pong. But I was pleasantly surprised, for a bit...

Showed up to the venue around 8pm and took a couple of minutes to locate it. There's a small sign on King Street pointing towards the alleyway but walking through there still made me confused. I kept going and sure enough I saw the Spin sign pointing down some stairs. They even had one of those sliding peephole things you see in the movies, though it wasn't being used. No password needed.

Walked in and the girls at the reception desk greeted me. I told them my friends had reserved a table and they smiled and said to walk right in. They had a stack of old television sets displayed on the ground playing The Big Lebowski. Nice touch. Also in the front area was a display case of ping-pong accessories. Another nice touch.

The place is pretty massive and it was cool seeing so many people deep into games of ping-pong. The black lights were in full effect, but from what I heard this isn't an everyday occurrence so not sure what the lighting is usually. Found my friends, said hello, and proceeded to the bar for a pint. They had a dozen good beers on tap (I counted) and a glass of Creemore was 7 bucks, which is decent. The bartender was very nice and polite. There was also an absolutely stunning server who would check up on our table and ask for drinks. She was so amazing I almost asked her out, which is totally not my style but I was pretty mesmerized.

They have these guys who go around collecting balls with this little net. It's pretty cool because you can basically just go about and play your games and not worry about stray ping-pong balls as they just swoop them up and drop them back into the bucket next to your table. Very cool. They even seem to have some sort of VIP ping pong table if you're fancy. Oh, and free coat check!

From around 8pm to 10pm they were playing amazing soul music. Stuff like Otis Redding and Smokey Robinson. The music definitely played a big role in how much I was enjoying myself. But when after that the shitty dance music started to pipe through the speakers. Started off with some wack remix of Notorious BIG and then I started to see the club kids slowly wander in.

We stayed for another hour and bounced at 11pm and the place was pretty bumping at that point, but the vibe had completely changed. I loved this place early on when the music and people were perfect, but I can see it becoming a questionable experience during late-night hours. I would love to come back and practice my pong skills but I'm going to do some research and find out the best times to come back when the music is tight."}
{"text":"SPIN: As good as it gets! My friend brought us here on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy but we only had to wait about 20-25 minutes for a table. The place was spotless, spacious, and they have a designated person to pick up your balls! Amazing!!! They have this handy dandy net and can pick up hundreds in seconds. Ping pong has never been this much fun. A large group of us went and we all took turns playing. There are 2 bars and they have a variety of drinks. I stuck with the cider and it was delicious. An hour of play was $40 and they give you a 10 minute warning. If you're looking for a chill spot with a cool crowd, try SPIN! The bathrooms were also clean and there were plenty of them.
Can you please build one in Los Angeles?"}
{"text":"This is a great venue for corporate team outings. The folks can accommodate groups of all sizes. The toughest part is to get a reservation here on a day of your choice and the best part is that everybody wants to play ping pong as it is a lot of fun. There are unlimited balls and you can hit wherever you want. There is a person collecting all the balls. I have seen folks who play for fun and there are competitive games too where people fight till the last point. It's up to you to decide how you want to take it.  The food is good. The Chicken sliders are my favourite. The servers are friendly and there is coat check in. Overall, a great experience - won't hesitate to give"}
{"text":"Its ping pong.  Its booze.  Its good music....what more can you ask for?  A king west place that isn't completely douchy !!

Never ate here really, but never came for a meal.  See first line....ping pong, booze, music.  

The weekend prices for tables though at night are quite high, but then again....there always booked.  But i usually come during the week for fun and relaxing.   Some people are way to intense at the game though haha.  

Watch out for balls in your face :)"}

You can play ping pong which is awesome and there is ample amount of space. The bar offers a variety of drinks and there is also a small food menu. I will be coming back for some chill fun times soon!"}
{"text":"Brought my work crowd for a great Friday lunch and drinks 2 weeks ago. Was fun!

The Server was horrible. He was perhaps overwhelmed that there were 20 of us. Didn't seemed happy to be making the tips from being busy. I understand it's still their soft launch, but com'on, everyone was drinking and you're giving us an annoyed look for Friday? Then the server over charged me, gave me an event room charge when clearly I am paying for just the tables and my drink + food order.

The front desk tried to iron it out for me, but they really never got around to it. She tried to iron it out but her last correspondance to me was that the server didn't get back to her on the table/court time charges after I left thnking my coworkers didn't pay for it. Maybe I should be drinking there anymore. Give the $ to their competition by drinking elsewhere first,  then go play, laugh, and enjoy the company you bring?

Great potential, but com'on service was down right horrible for a downtown establishment that's just launching."}
{"text":"Came for a large birthday party.  Great location though the entrance is a bit hard to find since it's in the middle of an alleyway.  We rented a ping pong table for 2 hours.  It's a large basement location.  You get all the ping pong balls you want and no need to pick them up off the floor since the staff are going around collecting them.  They've got a large bar and a good food menu though I only had drinks that night."}
{"text":"I heard about the Spin concept on a late night talk show and suggested it to my friends.  I think we were all glad we tried it.  There happened to be a charity event in the front room with live music but even when they sent us to the back we had a blast.  You can be as terrible as you want.  They don't mind newbs.  They pick up your balls for you and you pay for time spent at a table.  We ordered an appetizer and drinks and killed an hour, probably could have stayed longer.  They don't accept American dollars."}
{"text":"Came here for a social event. I have to say, whoever picked this place is brilliant, and whoever came up with the idea of opening a ping pong bar is a genius. There are a handful of pool bars in Toronto, but ping pong? really? 

It is a bar and a ping pong place at the same time. Do not know how to play ping pong? Me too, so does everyone else there actually. I still had fun though. For those clumsy people, you might want to be extra careful. You will either die from balls hitting you in the face or from slipping on them. The 4 stars rating is not for the food. I did not eat, and it's not really good place to eat (You will agree with me, when you have ping pong balls on your plate). It is just a very social place, and a good change from pool, billiard and foosball.

When it gets later, the crowd quadrupled and it looked more like a bar. Good selections of beer (Czechvar and Paulaner!!) It gets really booked though. Bumped into a friend at Soma, becausehe could not get a table. Everything was booked until 12am (It was 8pm, Thursday night). My advice, make reservations!!! 

I would go again, if I have a bunch of friends who do not know what to do and we happen to be close to King.

PS. They serve mixed drinks in candy jars, and you get to sit around those picnic tables!!!
PPS. The balls have \"Hopcity\" printed on them.
PPPS. You do not have to pick up ping pong balls you dropped because you suck. They have people hired to do that!!!!"}

The price to play is indeed high - $60 an hour during primetime - but playing doubles, and rotating a fair bit, I don't think anyone felt put out.

Surprisingly, the beer selection was fantastic. I didn't progress past the rack of Hop City taps...because they had a rack of Hop City taps! Cool beans. Try out Happy Hour/Big Mouth, if you haven't.

Also, friggin CHRIS BOSH was there. And it's not like he still lives in Toronto, he was here for a Heat v. Raptors game. So wtf, if it's good enough for CB4 on a road trip, I dig it. When approaching him didn't work, we tried tweeting him. That was even less effective.

So, right. Chris Bosh."}
{"text":"It's fun because of the ping pong, but not as fun because it's seemingly run by teenagers."}
{"text":"SPiN is a indoor ping pong bar, I came here with a large group of about 15 people and we booked 2 tables. Even though not everyone could play at the same time it was still a great time as the games didn't last very long. Their drink selection of beer and alcohol is extensive and reasonably priced and the servers are coming around every 10-15 to check up on your table. This is a great place to check out with some good friends or to go on a date."}
{"text":"Who knew that douche bags liked ping pong so much?

It seems as though the bright orange balls attract their feeble minds like catnip.

Don't you dare call it a Ping Pong place.  It's a \"social club\".  If by \"social\" you mean \"Ping Pong\".

I couldn't figure the place out.   You can probably buy your own ping pong table for your home at around the price of a round of beer here.   

The aesthetic is warehouse-chic.   The tables seem well lit.    The crowd is a mix of \"Bridge and Tunnel\"  and \"King Street Vomit\".

Everyone's so quick to let you know that famed Hollywood grandmother Susan Sarandon is an investor in this spot.    I'm still not quite so sure why this is relevant.    I have no idea what she has to do with either bars or ping pong.   I mean, that's like saying that a plug-in electrical grill can be marketed based on it's loose connection with a former Heavyweight champ.  Ludicrous.

I had the fish tacos.  They were totally adequate, perhaps a notch above standard pub fare.   I ate them while watching two people playing ping pong.  Neither of whom was Susan Sarandon.

How did they think up this place?    How did they convince a legitimate financial institution to back this ridiculous premise?

I truly left more confused than when I entered."}
{"text":"Although I would typically give this place a 4* I was really disappointed with the experience I had Saturday night. I reached out directly to give them a chance to respond but I received no reply.

We got a reservation during peak time meaning it was $80 including tax. When we got to our table everything was fine however about 5 minutes into the play the overhead light went out and was off for most of the game except for the times it would flicker brightly. This made it nearly impossible to see the ball and when the light did flicker brightly it was very distracting. It ruined the whole playing time as we may as we were basically trying to play ping pong in the dark. Hoping this gets fixed before someone else has the same experience as us.

The service was also quite slow as we had to flag someone twice to get drinks that didn't come until about 30 mins into the hour."}
{"text":"Came here for a party as a guest. We took out three ping pong tables in the back room.

The concept is very fun - there's food and a full bar. There's seating and tall tables around the ping pong tables for spectators. When you arrive, each table has four paddles and a bucket of balls waiting to be used. The paddles are in pretty good condition - not new, and nothing really special. Some of the balls were squished, but overall it wasn't a problem. You can hit the balls anywhere you want, since there are attendants picking them up and refiling your buckets continuously.

The drinks menu was pretty good. I didn't get the impression that the bartender was very skilled though - every time we ordered a drink he would pull out a little laminated binder with drink recipes and follow them. As a result it took him maybe twice as long to get drinks out as it usually would. Drinks were served in these cute mason jars. 

We had quite a few of the drinks - the Peach Pit was a little bland, and not very strong. A predominantly club soda taste to it. Their Mexican spin of an Old Fashioned, the Pasado de Moda (definitely the most expensive drink on the menu at $15.50) was pretty overpriced but pleasantly strong, with a fun giant cube of ice. Not worth the price though. Hurricane and Singapore Sling were both fruity and very sweet. Long Island Iced Tea was very solid, and they made a pretty good Manhattan too.

I had a lot of fun, but I do have to say that I don't think I would have come if I was paying for it myself. The combo of drinks and ping pong seems a bit counter-intuitive - by the third drink the only thing I wanted to do was sit and watch (and drink some more), the opposite of playing ping pong."}
{"text":"Why go to a regular bar to drink when you can go to Spin to drink and watch your ping pong skills get progressively worse as the night goes on?  I don't even know how to play ping pong and still found it really fun! 

This is a fun place to go with a bunch of friend.  Usually the worst part of ping pong, especially if you suck is running after the stupid ping pong ball, but at Spin they have a huge basket of ping pong balls at the ready and people who will collect the ping pong balls and refill the baskets.  This is crucial for terrible players like me.

I also noticed that they have individual stall washrooms.  I quite like that too."}
{"text":"I went in here to check out the vibe. It was a nice novel concept, to have a ping pong bar. Great music and glow. Looked like great hangout spot. Charges by time or can grab drinks at the bar. There was a nice glow inside. Also staff going around gathering ping pong balls from the ground with a net/sweeper. There were benches and tables and spots to sit and lounge."}
{"text":"I've only been on a weeknight so it wasn't too busy and I had a lot of fun. Alcohol and beer pong, whats not to love?"}
{"text":"Ping pong + good eats + booze + fun ambiance = good times. I booked 2 tables in the back for my husband's 30th birthday party. The official party area was booked, but the space we had was great as it was separate from the main large area and located close to benches (good for coats/purses). But most importantly it was close to the bar, which meant that guests wouldn't be gone for too long or linger far from the group and break up the good vibe. Our group had 20 people of very different ages, backgrounds and tastes, and everyone had fun. Some of our guests ordered food, some got their drink on at the bar, some chatted at tables, and most played ping pong. The staff were very friendly when booking the reservation and throughout the night. Just a heads up that SPiN is very loud (it's all hard surfaces, which doesn't help the acoustics). I suggest booking well in advance (i.e. several weeks) if reserving for a Thurs-Sat. Also, please be forewarned that they are VERY SERIOUS about showing up on time and leaving on time as they accommodate back-to-back reservations."}
{"text":"Good: The hostesses were very nice. 

Better: It was glow-in-the-dark night. I never realized what a toothy smile I have!

BEST: The badminton racket shaped thingie that they use to pick up the stray ping-pong balls. Best job ever!

Unfortunately, almost everything else was bad. Don't get me wrong - being there made me want to indulge in a bit of ping pong myself, but not at this particular locale. The price to play is atrociously high, and the experience is schizophrenic. Loud atonal music prevents any ping pong commentary from the peanut gallery. I'm not sure if Susan Sarandon and Co. intend the place to double as a club, but dancing between the tables sure is awkward. I'd rather get my drank and ping pong on at the Legion. 

That being said, I think it's an interesting place for corporate events and probably worth it if you're really into ping pong and get a membership. The beer selection is decent albeit at standard King West prices, and the menu and cocktails look much more interesting than usual pub fare. 

Dollars:  $43 for an hour of walk-in ping pong and two pints."}
{"text":"Normally I don't like to write negative reviews for restaurants on here even when their food or service is questionable. But I just can't find words to describe my disappointment for the poor service they put on display during my client appreciation night right before Christmas. We reserved a table at Spin Toronto at least 2 weeks ahead and I was never been told or made aware that if I don't preorder platters you will lose your chance to order platters period... as they don't have platters on their regular menu (to me that's real odd). Anyways, after our group had been left at the table with absolutely no service or explanations for 25mins, nobody came to present us menus or asked us what we would like to drink, we started to ask questions and got sent to the bar to get drinks, which takes forever . It was our first (most likely the last time go to Spin) and it was a busy night, maybe that's how things work here...but that shouldn't be the kind of service one should expect when we had to agree into this $400 minimum expense for 5 of us within 2 hours and 18% mandatory tips on top, not including the table fee. When we were politely questioning about the platter order for the group, the manager (I don't want to name her) was being extremely unhelpful and almost rude, instead of trying to solve this problem or misunderstanding, and failed even to try to offer a smile or to show us she cared. We had to order everything on the 10-item limited menu and couldn't go anywhere near to the $400 minimum expense that we had to pay anyway. Good thing is that they did warn us the food is going to take only 45mins to be ready because it's a \"busy night\", so that helped a lot. The whole Spin Toronto experience made us feel like they are trying so hard to make every single one in our group to be unimpressed about their service and to make sure we won't come back again. 
To customers, don't go there unless you don't mind to be ignored and over paying for your food and pingpong. 
To the restaurant owner, don't let these people run your business like this and ruin your brand.  
To the HR manager at Spin Toronto, next time try to recruit staffs that are actually fit for hospitality industry, know how to smile and present positive customer experience. 
To the \"manager\" on that night and other waitresses that we had pleasure dealing with that night, keep that 18% gratuity and be thankful that was \"mandatory\" and pre-paid."}
{"text":"Update on the VIBE 
Not my favourite place on a Friday night. Mainly 905-er central. And to the douchebags who were trying to take pictures of us while utterly drunk: just remember when we left, you were literally on the floor by the end of the night. Stay classy.

Great Gin and Tonics though. Love the mason jar concept."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent venue for a corporate event in the city. They charge per table per hour rather than the number of people in your party, which was great for my work's social event - we were there more to socialize over an activity than to play a competitive ping pong tournament. 

TIP #1: Have someone in your party organize a round robin tournament for your group. It makes ping pong more enjoyable for everyone and ensures everyone gets equal time at the table. 

We also ended up ordering a bunch of share platters (open fire flatbread, all the (hogtown) grilled cheese, colombian empanadas) and drinks, but these really stood out to me:

- white sangria: these are amazing for only $8 (a bit steep, i know) a glass! They taste like twisted lemonades and my party ended up depleting their supply of sangria... whoops!
- open fire flatbread: what more could you ask for when you can get warm and toasty flatbread paired with a smooth and creamy hummus? definitely their best share platter that we tried. 
- all the grilled cheese: while you only get 12 quartered + double stacked sandwiches, this is a great heartier share platter option. i love the pesto dipping sauce that comes with it!

TIP #2: Don't plan on having a whole meal at SPiN as their food and drinks can get quite pricy. Think of it more as shareable happy hour apps!

Overall, I definitely recommend this place for a corporate social event. It has a great atmosphere to mingle with your colleagues outside the office, and your company will likely cover the more expensive costs that come with the venue."}
{"text":"SPiN is the hottest new place on King St W... awesome vibe, great music, full bar, friendly staff and of course some ping pong! They have frequent events and attractions such as their Dirty Dozen tournament where the best of the best face off in an exhibition style tournament to amaze the crowd. There's also a monthly open tournament for anyone to enter.

Tuesday nights are their Glow in the Dark pong sessions which are a blast!

Fridays and Saturdays the place is usually jam packed - so I'd advise reserving a table in advance if you want to play some pong... but it's always fun even if you just go for some drinks and spectate too. The crowd is pretty cool and I've met tons of awesome people here!

It's tons of fun and if you haven't been yet - you definitely should check it out soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, mostly for company's parties.  Its location is a little hidden, in the back of an alleyway and the establishment is in the basement level.  Spacious and fun space (black light in the evening), lots of ping pong tables, some lounge areas and a big screen TV in a corner.  Staff is courteous and is on top of picking up ping pong balls from the floor.  Food is unexpectedly good for a ping pong bar, but overall food & drinks and table rental are on the pricy end."}
{"text":"While I'm not an avid ping ponger (that's probably not correct terminology),  I do LOVE SPiN! 

I've been to SPiN for two private events, and both were fabulous. They are such a great venue to work with, and the space is amazing for a networking / cocktail social event. 

The space has three areas - one large room where there are 8ish tables, one smaller room in the back with about 6, and a private room with one table (it's beautiful!). 

The food here is also absolutely delicious - bacon lollipops anyone? And I love the drinks in the mason jars. While the front desk girls are not always the most attentive, the catering staff are absolutely amazing. 

I definitely recommend this place for a private event - also for a weekend evening out! Definitely a great alternative to a regular bar!"}
{"text":"Great spot if you're looking for a scenery change up. I mean, Ping Pong and drinks, what's there not to love!? 

From the outside, you can't really tell how big this place is, but there's probably 8-12 tables on inside. Weekends can get really busy, and the reservation process is terrible! You'll find empty tables reserved all night, while others are packed with too many people! 

Music is good though and the bar makes decent drinks. Can get a bit pricey though if you're there for more then a few hours. Perfect pre-drink spot though if you're going out for the night."}
{"text":"Got to party it up ping-pong style here for an awesome Yelp event and really enjoyed my night at Spin Galactic.  A word of advice getting here though, the venue is actually located on the cobble stoned King to Wellington lane way and don't get confused as there is an actual Spin bike studio in the same building, just walk by to the end of the building and down the stairway and you'll find Spin Galactic.

It's kinda weird picturing the idea of a ping-pong evening social club,  as the combination of black lights and ping-pong balls brings to mind freak-show girlie bars in Bangkok, but there's none of that type of debauchery to be found here!!! 
Like Daniel B says there is the usual \"King street vomit\" crowd playing Pong whilst wearing suits, platform pumps and Prada dresses, wtf?  But there were also some nice folks here just for a good time wielding some mad paddle skillz too.  It's also mega fun watching folks play pong whilst on the verge of getting sloshed and oh yes the drinks here are quite tasty (and $$) so it may be a challenge resisting the urge to lubricate.

Amazingly enough this place gets suitably packed as we were here on a Monday night and upon leaving around 10:30pm there was still a lineup about 10 deep queueing to get in.  

If you're looking to change up the usual night out, and don't mind shelling out a little extra dough for the novelty of smacking some balls around, I'd definitely suggest getting your pong on at Spin Galactic."}
{"text":"The Pretzel Knots ($10) were quite popular. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the yummy dip completed this snack. Their Short Ribs Smörgåsbord melted off the bones perfectly, which I highly recommend if you love ribs. They have a couple of adult fruit punch that are great for the crowd! Overall I was very impressed with the food that Spin Toronto served. The prices were quite reasonable too!

So next time if you decide to drop by for a friendly game of ping pong, take a look at their menu as well!"}
{"text":"Came back here last weekend for the first time in a year when the Yelp Elite party took place.

The vibe is simply too douchey, as Natalie mentioned it's pure 905ers. There is a large variety of age groups here, but it is 80% 19-21s.

It gets very busy and if you're trying to hang out and have a conversation, you're more than likely going to end up with balls in your face. Seating is scarce, a few picnic tables scattered around between tables. 

It's probably a lot more fun if you actually want to play ping pong...."}
{"text":"Fun place to check out - it will kill some time and you will get a good sweat in if you're competitive at all."}
{"text":"Came for a work social (group of 14). Tables were $35 per table per hour before 5 pm and $55 after. Surrounding the tables were lounge couches and bar islands to grab a bite, drink, chat, and spectate. 

Some of the food was neither here nor there, although the attempts at unique fusion dishes were appreciated.

Cheetoh Chicharróns ($7) - Meh.

Loaded Poutine ($12) - Standard, however it was inconvenient to share or sneak in a quick bite between playing.

All the Hogtown Grilled Cheese ($40) - Savoury and satisfying. All the great things you would expect in grilled cheese. 

DIY Butcher Lettuce Wraps ($35) - Liked this one. Steak was tender and the Sambal sauce was zesty with a great kick.

Draft Beers and Ciders ($7) - I felt the selection was a little limited.

My experience at SPiN was enjoyable - good venue, laidback atmosphere, prompt service, and an opportunity for great team bonding."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here at first because I wasn't really sure what the scene would be like but it actually turned out to be a lot of fun! A group of us came by late one night and it was a super casual but nice place to chill, have a drink and play ping pong.

The music and lighting was kind of strange for a ping pong place but given its location I could see why they would want to try and make the place more trendy and lounge like. 

The snacks we had were surprisingly good as well! We had chicken and waffles which was delicious, grilled cheese, pretzels, as well as various cheese and meat boards. Our table was right by the bar and a few drinks in and everyone was having an awesome time. I had a great evening and would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it!"}
{"text":"I am the producer of a feminist film society in Toronto that has monthly screenings aimed at championing women in film. I reached out to SPiN with the hopes of gaining their sponsorship for our May 2016 screening of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY because we were looking for prizes we could giveaway that would act as \"date night\" packages. SPiN was happy to be one of our monthly sponsors and donate a few hours of pong to our lucky winners :)"}
{"text":"SPiN is fun! What a cool concept for Toronto. I love that they have machines that pick up the balls for the employees- I feel less guilty pelting the balls at my opponant. 

They have unique drinks and beer choices, and an inclusive environment. It's dark, glow in the dark, and the music isn't too loud. It gets packed on the weekends though, so reserve in advance for those dates!

I wouldn't order food here though- it's not great. Very plain- like burgers and cheese fries kind of thing."}
{"text":"SPiN is a pretty interesting concept in Toronto, since it is like a ping pong social lounge/bar kind of thing. Although I'm absolutely terrible at ping pong, I would say it's still a pretty fun place to come to with a group of friends or on a date or something. It is pretty pricey though, being about $17/hour I think on the weekends? I was lucky enough to come with a large group of people who booked a table for a birthday, so we ended up only having to pay $6.25/person for 2 hours.

The atmosphere at SPiN (at least when I went on a Saturday evening) is lively - they have a TV which was playing the Leafs game when I went. They also have a DJ who is pretty decent and plays some upbeat/club-type music. Even though the place gets super busy, it's pretty spacious, so it's not like you'll have rampant balls flying everywhere or people from other groups getting in your personal space. They have staff members who walk around sweeping up balls and refilling your ball buckets in a very efficient manner.

They also have food at SPiN, but I thought it was mediocre at best. I ordered a meat/charcuterie board for $13, and was disappointed with the meat to bread ratio. I think more than half of the board was bread/crackers, so I felt like I got tricked. I also ordered a mixed drink at the bar, and that plus a pint of beer ended up being around $20, which is not cheap. The bartender was pretty nice/cool/fun though, and I thought it was cute that they poured my drink into a mason jar-type glass.

Overall it is definitely a fun place to check out once in a while, but for a ping pong noob like me, it's not a place I would frequent often. I would recommend eating somewhere else before or after, because the food here really is not worth the price and you will leave hungry."}
{"text":"I came here as part of a work outing and it turned out to be one of my favorite venues. Spin is setup with ping pong tables on two sides with a bar in the middle. My company had 3 tables and a small lounge area with a fourth table. The food was excellent. My co-worker commented on how much he \"felt like an adult\" because there was a huge cheese platter with grapes. There were other platters with nachos and cheese, sliced dried meats, etc. Needless to say, it was pretty fancy. There were also Spin employees walking around serving food like beef tartare and grilled cheese sandwiches. We also received drink tickets.

The Spin employees also setup a tournament ladder for us. This was the first time I had this much physical exercise in months and I'm exhausted. The sign that stated that it was basically a gym with beer was pretty accurate.

The food was excellent and I had a lot of fun. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came for the work social, stayed for the rad device that collects the ping pong balls..."}
{"text":"Very fun and unique new way to chill ....

however, very very pricey.  35 dollar an hour... 

i could buy a whole set and go to the community centre to play for hours.

but i must say.. very fun.... a great way to break the ice."}
{"text":"Went here for some drinks and ping pong after dinner ... It's not nearly as cool as the blacklit vibe in Los Angeles.  Drinks were fine.  Service seemed annoyed to have us there."}
{"text":"I never liked ping pong in my basement - I'm not sure why I like it so much here.  There is something very social about the environment and the sport that work well here.  The space is huge and I love not having to chase down balls - they have people who pluck them up and put them back into a basket beside your table.  I'd come more regularly but the price of the tables seems a bit steep - close to $250 for 2 hours / 2 tables on a Saturday afternoon.  As a result, it tends to be more of large group activity as playing is a bit of a novelty."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great place for groups. The music& lighting puts you in the mood to play ping pong! We had the sliders which were average. The only setback is you need to wait for a table on the weekends and its a bit pricey."}
{"text":"In terms of a concept, it's cool. Drinking beer, listening to fun music, all while playing ping pong in a room with around 30 tables. 
My first visit was fun...Saturday night. Place was busy, but not packed like a normal Saturday night bar (obviously the tables take up a lot of room). We had a reso for a table, so we didn't have any waiting. It's kinda pricey to play...$40 for a hour, but it was fun. Drinks were also kinda expensive for a less than stellar 'bar' ambiance, but I suppose you're paying for the novelty."}
{"text":"Went here for a buddy's birthday in January, DID YOU KNOW SUSAN SARANDON IS PART OWNER OMG so anyway, the place is pretty cool looking inside, a little sparse looking but since they needed to leave room for the multiple ping pong tables - holla.

Part of the fun IMO, is that if you suck at ping pong it's extremely entertaining to watch the balls fly all over the room/land on humans/land on other human's tables/one time landing in another human's drink.  I mean this depends on your skills and does not in any way reflect on the service at SPiN Toronto.  Which btw, was great.  The staff was very intent when it came to picking up the balls with these cool net thingers (we wanted to try them too, no can do).

Any place where you can act like a total goofball while having several pints, is a place for me.  I don't remember how much it cost...if you play with enough people, it's not really an issue for your wallet to figure out.  I did find it amusing how people were playing in their mini club dresses, but hey whatever gets you pumped for your evening of grinding ahead!"}
{"text":"Great concept.

Classy.

Ping pong balls galore with ping pong ball boy."}
