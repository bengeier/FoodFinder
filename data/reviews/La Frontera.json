{"text":"I was in search for a burrito truck like the ones that you can find in Oakland, CA.  I was so excited when I found this place on yelp, but I was a little let down on the burritos and the tacos.   I don't know if its an Arizona thing, but where is the rice and beans in the burritos, or am I just a weirdo?  The tacos were decent, where's the cilantro and onions?  Where are my spicy carrots and radishes?    The meat was good though.  For $4 a burrito and $1.25 for a taco, it was not bad I guess.  I wouldn't make the 30 minute trip next time."}
{"text":"New Mexican spot in Matthews was awesome!! I ordered the Burrito Texano and my friend ordered the Naked Burrito.  The food was fresh and delicious.   Def would recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"First time here love the food hand made tortillas is the best, will come back when am back in town"}
{"text":"The area is a little sketchy but the food makes up for it.  The cane asada tacos were loaded with very flavorful and delicious meat. It tasted very fresh.  Don't be afraid of eating at this place!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Phoenix. Don't be jaded by its exterior because the interior is cooking up the most authentic Mexican tacos and burritos around."}
{"text":"Great Mexican street food! Well ok I should say great burritos because to date that is all we have had here, they are addictive. I order the shrimp burrito with no beans and I ask for cabbage, they are freaking incredible, the shrimp burritos are more expensive at $8 but are worth every penny.  My husband orders the beef burrito with no beans. No there is no rice, sour cream or cheese in these burritos, if you want that go to your local crappy chain Tex Mex fast food joint.  My husband speaks Spanish, but I'm sure you are fine ordering in english."}
{"text":"Cute little food truck with a cute little eating patio. Best sonoran hot dog EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from la where we have street tacos everywhere!! This place give me that dtla feel. Seafood, tacos burritos!! You name it. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"This food truck has the best service, food, and menu. The prices are very affordable, the food is delicious, and they are never unprepared. I've been here multiple times and haven't had a bad experience yet. This business definitely deserves more customers."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, quick and very reasonably priced. The outdoor seating is clean and plentiful. The only issue I have is that everything on the menu is in Spanish so we had to struggle through our order. One of the people in the truck came over while we were ordering and spoke to us in English, but our food still didn't come out the right way. There were ingredients missing on 3 of 5 items plus they made extra food that we did not order and charged us for it initially (although to their credit when we brought it back up they refunded our money).The food is delicious, but you might not receive exactly what you order. I would still say...try it!"}
{"text":"Freshly made authentic mexican food, open late. Near the airport. First stop after landing at PHX at 10pm. Ordered three tacos (carne asada, al pastor, and chicken). Each order gives you two tacos, so I had a total of six. Green sauce, red sauce, lime, and cucumbers came with the tacos. They call out the number in spanish, but luckily counting in spanish isn't that hard. I got the horchata but it wasn't well mixed and was powdery at the bottom. Take it to go or eat at the picnic tables. Saw a bunch of Mexican families there during my visit."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very new. But it is the only Mexican food near here without having to go all the way to South Blvd. Not officially opened as of 11/29/2012 but serving food. Waiting for his liquor license to come in before he has the grand opening. Had the lunch special of 3 tacos with a side of refried beans. Has many choices of tacos. Ground beef, steak, chicken, marinated shredded chicken and a couple more I can't remember. The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was very good, Very tomatoey, lots of onion and cilantro and just enough heat. Not runny and watery. The tacos were quite good. I had the ground beef with lettuce, tomato and cheese. They were very tasty. They are also offered with cilantro and onion as well. The man running the place served me and was extremely friendly and made sure everything was OK or if I needed anything like more chips or anything else. The best part was my bill was only $6.41 and I wasn't still hungry when I left. I think I'll be going back there again."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Phoenix... that i am aware of. If you are looking for good tasting real Mexican tacos, this is the place to go. nothing fancy just great food."}
{"text":"La Frontera is choice #2 for me and the missus when we need a fix of street food. Street food is supposed to be simple and the tacos at La Frontera are just that, simple and to the point.   If you're looking for a Mission style burrito, you will be disappointed. But if you want tasty tacos de chicharron or carne asada, you're in for a treat.  Part of the problem here in Arizona is that we have a mix of expectations when it comes to food because there's not much tradition and a healthy influx of people from other areas here. While I'm not sold on the Sonoran Hot Dogs at many other places around here, La Frontera's sister cart (same parking lot) does a great job putting together awesome hot dogs with everything on them.  As for tacos, skip the Al Pastor, I still haven't found a place here that makes 'em the way I like (crazy thin sliced off the spit, sweet and succulent, with pineapple). Go for the Carne Asada, Chicharron or the Lengua, anything else and your guess is good as mine as we've been just twice."}
{"text":"It is a small lot. You would miss this if you weren't looking for it. The food is great - I love it. They offer many varieties and the toppings are fresh!! Everything is so rich and flavorful- cooked just right!! I love their tortillas"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Found my new taco spot. Hot and fresh. *Cash only*"}
{"text":"5 + Stars. This place is great even though it's a taco truck fresh carne asada fresh beans fresh everything. I would pick this place over any Mexican restaurant anytime. I've went in the morning  at 10 am and 2 a.m. and it's still the best quality of food. I wish they would open a restaurant and they be making bank. Never had a bad experience and recommend it to anybody and everybody!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak fajitas for $11.99. I thought it was pricey for lunch, but no lunch specials on Saturday and Sunday. So when meal arrived it looked great! It was hot, fresh and very good. Had enough to take home for leftovers. Our waitress even asked us if we wanted chips and salsa to go. I would definitely recommend and will return. Nice place!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place by accident!! So glad I did! Awesome Pastor Tacos! I have been back 2 more times and it continues to be consistently good!"}
{"text":"I'm getting tired of yelp being wrong about times places open and what they serve. When I'm driving through a town, I don't have time to waste.  This place does not have Sonoran hot dogs and an orange Jarrito was $2.25. To be fair I didn't order any food because all I wanted was to try a Sonoran hot dog which is what I searched for in yelp."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over 40 times. I love the carnitas burrito and it's sort of my go to. This place is very consistent and I've never had a bad burrito. Their red sauce and green guacamole sauce are very good. I love the food, but the neighborhood can be a little dicey. I just wish they were closer to my house."}
{"text":"We arrived at Phoenix airport at midnight and this place was very convenient because it's close to the airport and open until 2 a.m.  I was impressed by the homemade corn tortillas. The tacos we excellent with lots of meat!"}
{"text":"The best carne asada burritos in town!! they actually have the best burritos I ever tasted in my life. You want real Mexican food.. go there!!  Thanks to my Mexican friends for introducing this hidden gem to me!  OK hear this.. this place is so good I took a friend visiting from DC to it and he liked it so much a year later I was going on a trip to DC he called me asking me to bring 6 carne asada burritos with me and I did!! bought them, froze them overnight, took 'em with me to DC and he couldn't be happier!! TRUE STORY lol"}
{"text":"Fantastic. We tried them the week after they opened. Starting with chips the queso with chorizo - excellent.  I had the taco and enchilada, very fresh and tasty. Wife had fish tacos, shrimp and fish and I will get them next time.   Kiddo had the quesadilla and loved it. Came with bowl of rice in a hard tortilla bowl as do the beans. Very clever.   Locally owned an operated. This place is a gem.  Fresh reasonable Mexican with a full ball (full bar will be open soon with mixologist) - Can't wait to go back.   Fresh, friendly, great service and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best carne asada tacos in all of Phoenix! Enough said."}
{"text":"I have been going to this taco truck for a few years and they never cease to amaze me. Meat is always fresh, tortillas are good as well. Try the Al Pastor tacos! You'll love them!"}
{"text":"Searching for food near Carolina's which was closed. Saw a line and a group of people eating and thought that must be a good sign. IT WAS GREAT! Had carnitas tacos that are amazingly delicious, chili verde burrito with papas is carnitas with green chilis-yum, the the chorizo torta with fresh avocado and grilled jalape√±os - awesome. Very impressed. Great tortillas too."}
{"text":"I had to double check to make sure this was the same place I ate, considering the other reviews.  I think when I went here there was one or two good reviews that made me check it out, only to find a below average Mexican joint.  Went on a Friday night, around 6 or 6:30.  There was one other person eating in the entire restaurant.  Service shockingly slow considering only one other patron.  Decor was weird and oddly spacious... in a way that indicated they didn't have enough money for more booths.    However, I'm more moved by food.  Hence my disappointment.  The chips were cold and the salsa was weak.  Cheese dip was fine.  I went with my usual \"go-to\" meal, the tacos al carbon.  The refried beans were cold, and based on the cheese on top, were never more than luke warm.  The steak was tasteless.    Sadly the food is just as expensive as surrounding Mexican places, like Don Pedro's and Salsas, with worse food, decor and service.  Maybe I should give it another chance based on other reviews but it has been the worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"We have struggled to find good Mexican food since moving to Charlotte. Found it here at La Frontera! Having lived in TX for 7 years from San Diego, we have a love for the traditional Mexican of So. Cal., and then discovered what became some all-time favorite TexMex dishes. We couldn't even find a decent margarita here until we found La Frontera. The guacamole and margaritas were good, as was the taco sampler plate. I had camarones al mojo de ajo (shrimp in garlic butter). My only suggestion, which the manager promised to help with the next time, is for the shrimp to be deveined and shells removed before cooking. Tail on would be simple enough to remove, but it took me a good 10 minutes to clean and shell all of them, and by then, my husband was half-finished and most everything else was cold. Like I said though, the manager said he would take care of it the next time we ordered a shrimp dish. Attentive & friendly service in a clean cheerfully decorated restaurant goes a long way too!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. I really wanted to like this place. It has good reviews and is close to home. Unfortunately, I stopped in on a Wednesday around 6pm looking to try their margaritas and get some food to go. Sat at the bar, waitress brought chip n salad right away and they were good, although then salsa was watery. Waited for another 10 minutes as more diners filtered in. Nobody asked us if we wanted a drink or anything. The one girl working (is that even possible?) was in the back and putting to go orders together most of the time I was there. I ended up leaving without trying anything and wanted to post a review so the owners might see it and add more staff. Hate to give a low rating but...? Will try again and update this review. I really hope you guys can get it together."}
{"text":"Sonoran Hot Dogs. Insanely good. Enuff said. Do this place up after the bars and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"The best tacos you can find in Phoenix! Very sketchy looking on the outside but inside there is magic happening. The only place I know that can make amazing cabeza. Stop by here if you're looking for amazing, authentic Mexican tacos near Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went to this place because Nogales Hot Dogs wasn't open yet. It was not impressive. I wouldn't call their hot dogs \"Sonoran hot dogs.\" They're more like fully loaded hot dogs that happen to be wrapped in bacon. Tasted like store bought hot dogs with only a little bit of beans, onions, ketchup, mustard, tomatoes on them. The horchata was just okay but came with mostly ice and only a little bit of horchata. The fries were, however, very good. Thick cut fries seasoned with salt and pepper, those were the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Their Chile Rellanos are out of this world, and truly the best that I have had in over 20 years. I chose to have them with beef, and swapped out the rice for black beans, to go along with the re-fried beans. Their salsa is very good, and tastes like a salsa that I used to go to a certain Mexican restsurant in Charlotte many years ago to buy by the container.  Portions are plentiful, service is good, everyone was extremely friendly, and prices are reasonable!  I'm quite sure that you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sonoran hotdogs are apparently a thing and because I love hotdogs, I made sure to stop by to try one.   The hotdogs run $3 bucks a pop. I (think) there's coating of beans on the hotdog, and is topped with tomatoes, onions, jalepe√±os, and shredded cheese. The bun was toasted and robust enough to withstand the medley of toppings.  The hotdog was great - it was unlike anything I have ever tasted. I liked that touch of beans because it gave it this distinct flavor. Not much to complain about considering it was three bucks.  The truck is located on a vacated lot - there are two La Frontera trucks. The one you want to hit up for a Sonoran hotdog is #3."}
{"text":"I literally tell everyone about this place. It's so good  I've never once went and had a complaint. Everyone I've ever brought to try it now religiously goes back because they are hooked as well. I always get the carne asada or el pastor in a taco or burrito. Good quality, size and prices. If you haven't been you need to go! Super authentic and delicious!! Bring cash though! Unless anything's changed since I last went they only take cash but it's so worth it"}
{"text":"OMG, where to start. Just to add to what Scott said, they received their liquor license and seemingly have everything running already. They're also adding a cute store next door. I spoke to the owners and they want to do a Cracker Barrel type set-up next door, it's very novel and really stands out, but let's talk about what actually matters, the FOOD.  I lived in Mexico for a few years and i grew up in a 100% Mexican household. Nothing about me screams gringo, and yet I've been frustrated to go to other Mexican restaurants and see them whitewash their menu, pun intended. I love my burgers and hot dogs and so forth, but when I go for Mexican food, I'm NOT going for a Tex-Mex, Americanized version of Mexican food like fish tacos. There's a time and place for all of that, but not when you want real Mexican food.  This place is the real deal. All the food is prepared by Mexicans, the entire staff is Hispanic as are the owners, and the selection is crazy. From sopes to burritos (okay, arguably not real Mexican food, but might as well be in today's age) to mole to the hand-made tortillas (I asked, they hand-make tortillas, how awesome is that!?), to the tacos and nachos, this place feels like a Mexican home's kitchen simply expanded to accomodate 80 people. The food is as authentic as anything my mom would make, and by no means are you getting any watered down Mexican. Having said that, it comes as no surprise that the food is delicious. My personal favorites are the Hurache (like a Mexican flatbread with meat on top) and the sopes (like...well just go have it), all the food tastes fresh, delicious, and you're full mid-way to the plate. Just like, and i can't stress it enough, actual, real, Mexican Food.  What else....  FANTASTIC prices. You can get crazy-full for five bucks, let alone ten. They lunch specials with gigantic sized portions, I don't know how they do it. Parking is ample, location is central to everything (about five minutes from where I work, which is a perk), and super clean inside with lots of seating and really beautiful decor. And the service, they treat you a smile and an unparalleled attention to your needs. A++++++++++++  If you haven't made this a weekly or even daily lunch spot, you're missing out. This is simply a destination and a must-go to any Charlottian who wants real Mexican food, and I mean real, not your Cantina 1511's or Cabo's, or other poser Mexican joints. This is real deal la raza right here."}
{"text":"To be honest I just wasn't that impressed with the place.  I can name several Mexican restaurants in a five mile radius that are better.  Service was good, but there were only two tables occupied when we were there (counting ourselves)."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for cheap Mexican food.  Started coming here last year.  It would be good if you order in Spanish, but English would do just fine.  Great place to be at after a long night of drinking too.  This isn't the safest area in the neighborhood, but the food is good, so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"If you fly into Phoenix and you're starving, be brave and wait until you get in your car and drive 5 minutes to La Frontera.  Great street tacos.  Don't get scared away by it being off the beaten path.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Best food we have found yet. We drive 45 mins just to eat here and often we just take it to go and find a nice quite place to enjoy it. This place is always worth the drive. Taco are delicious. The burritos are stuffed with only meaty goodness and the Sonoran  dogs are pretty darn good too!  The green salsa is an absolute must have with your tacos or burritos! Nice that it stays open late for those late night cravings! Writing this review makes me want to jump in my car and make the 45 min drive again!"}
{"text":"Really yummy homestyle Mexican. Ordered take-out (enchildas verdes and oaxaca ) and they were just delicious. Can't wait to eat-in and try their margaritas!"}
{"text":"Great Sonoran dogs and shrimp burritos. Good prices (cash only) but you have to eat outside and you're definitely not paying for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been looking for authentic mexican street tacos for five years, and by Lordy-Mae I've found em'! I'm originally from Mexico and like any Mexican will tell \"My city San Luis, Sonora has THE BEST tacos in all of Mexico\" . It's hard to replicate the flavor or the (sazon) but La Frontera has certainly succeeded. Well done La Frontera, well done."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Mexican. It does not get better than this for tacos and the like. Al pastor pork is an \"11\" as Nigel would say."}
{"text":"This is the closest Food place next to my office and I am never disappointed in the fare i get from here. They have all the classic Mexican flavor I'm looking for and it's a classic spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! I come here while I'm working and the tacos are soooo delicious! The crew working is super friendly and generous! Don't be afraid to try this roach-coach! They will not let you down!"}
{"text":"Best burrito ever!  I'm not a Spanish speaker, but had no trouble ordering lunch.  We had one chicken and one shredded beef.  Both were great and served piping hot.  The burritos are huge, plenty to split."}
{"text":"These food truck tacos are so darn good! The al pastor tacos are my fave and I come and eat here just for them! The meat is spicy, juicy, and has such great flavor. Get it with the toppings (cabbage, onion, cilantro) and bam your mouth will thank you later. Also, make sure to squirt on the green and red salsas!  Don't let the location steer you away from this place since it does tend to appear a little sketchy! I've eaten here at different times of the day and I have never felt uncomfortable!   Oh and it's CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Omg the best Mexican food I've had in AZ. Had the carne asada burrito and was like THAT'S IT! That's what I've been missing! Couldn't even think about not eating the whole thing. Outstanding flavor - guac and salsa are delicious as well but not even needed it was so flavorful on its own. I will make the 50 mile round trip to get this mouth watering food. Don't mind the shabby parking lot. At least there's parking."}
{"text":"THE BEST tacos I have had in the US and Mexico. The carne Asada tacos are incredible and fresh. The meat is always juicy and flavorful. Nothing beats this place and everyone needs to come try it!!!"}
{"text":"(Cash only.) This place is so amazing. People, stop going through those disgusting drive through taco places after the bar, come here! It's local and authentic. Yum! I usually get the tacos, $2 each or something like that. Cheap. Delicious. I am there at least 1-2's a week (not just post bar.) The menu is all in Spanish and they speak it also so, figure it out, lol."}
{"text":"Love this place.  First went for lunch.  The place is SPOTLESS, bright, cheerful.  Had the Flautas and they were very good and as mentioned in previous reviews, fairly priced.  Service was very nice - prompt, friendly, unobtrusive.   Took the family for dinner last night, arrived late and were greeted as if they had been staying just in case we came.  Great selection of Mexican beers and tequilas.  Food was delicious - you can get fajitas everywhere but these are really good.  Service again was excellent."}
{"text":"This find is gold, and I'm not sure if I am ready to share this to the world. They're located in an empty parking lot behind a Jack in the Box on 16th street. This place is so authentic you have to order in Spanish. I've tried the carne asada, lengua (cow tongue), barbacoa, and pollo tacos. It comes on cucumbers on the side with green and red sauce. This last time, I tried the burrito de chile verde, filled with what I believe was very tender carne asada meat inside. Horchata comes in super large size. The prices are super cheap for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Looking for a romantic, cozy place to take your date on Saturday night? If so, this is certainly NOT the place for it. However, if you want to practice your Spanish skills and eat awesome food from a truck parked on a busy road, this is your spot!  I had two tacos: carne asada and al pastor. Both were excellent. I also had a vampiro with carnitas...kind of like a tostada. The meat is really juicy and tender. All of it tastes like it has been marinating for a good amount of time.  I've spent a fair amount of time in Mexico and this made me feel like I was a back there. To my right, a woman selling bootleg DVDs. To my left, Spanish-speaking families drinking soda out of glass bottles. Not the best area of town and to be honest, it smells a little funny...but if that doesn't put you off go check it out!"}
{"text":"Perfect street tacos. I couldn't stop ordering them.  The carnitas, el pastor, and carne asada tacos were awesome, tender and crispy.  Pretty easy to find and I had no problem conversing in English (although I chose to practice the small amount of Spanish I know).  Totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"I waited until eating here several times and trying different things on the menu before writing my review. Overall, I've been pretty unimpressed with Phoenix Mexican food since moving here.  Turns out La Frontera serves up what I consider to be the real deal. I'm surprised there's not more competition (send me suggestions!).   Hands down, the shrimp taco from the seafood side is my favorite. Perfectly fried and comes with a nice sauce. I'd pass on the ceviche...I'm not a fan of the tomato juice they mix it with. From the meat side, I like pretty much everything but tripitas, cabeza, and lengua are my favorites. I usually get a mixed plate of tacos and for some reason, they always seem to mess up just one of my taco meats. Other than that complaint, prices and hours are great."}
{"text":"The best original Mexican food around... The meat is so tender and juicy. The handmade tortillas are the best. The portions huge... The quesadillas are amazing... Everything taste so good... The also have ceviche.great also. Love this place. The people are super nice."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place out after seeing all the hype on yelp =)  .. Came to the conclusion that they are just OKAY.. Not the best. There are much better taco trucks out here. 2 stars for their decent closing hours, place to get food when you have NO OTHER OPTIONS. Either way, if it came down to that I would rather eat juliobertos or Albertos (Etc)"}
{"text":"Greatest Tacos ever! I have traveled far and wide to find Taco perfection. My journey has come to an end.  This is Taco Bliss."}
{"text":"The tacos I had here - chicharron, carnitas, pollo, and carne asada - were really good and so inexpensive. They were very well-seasoned, with a little bit of spicy kick; If you want more heat, the tables have plastic bottles of red and green salsas. This is beyond hole-in-the-wall, though: La Frontera consists of two trucks, each with a blue tarp and dining tables and chairs beside it. Both are kind of permanently stationed in a lot on 16th Street near Van Buren, with a Watermill station in the middle of the lot. I got my tacos from the truck nearest the street; the other truck is for mariscos and Sonoran  hotdogs."}
{"text":"When I told people back home I was moving to Phoenix, I always got one of two responses: \"It's hot as hell... but it's a dry heat\" and \"I hope you like Mexican food.\" Well as luck would have it, I'm a major taco guy, and La Frontera is the real deal. It's in a parking lot behind a Jack in the Box, and the eating space is constituted by a few tables outside under a tarp with pigeons and a stray cat hanging around. In my opinion all of that really authenticates the whole experience.  They have all the meat choices found at any legit taco shop, and they do them well. Someone once told me you can really judge the quality of a good taco place by their tortillas. Well, this place definitely makes their own and fries em up to perfection. I would definitely recommend the asada, lengua, al pastor, and chicharon tacos -- maybe the cabeza if you like some good head ;) Also the chili verde burrito is a delicious, fat ol thang at $6. Throw some cilantro-lime crema sauce on that bad boy and settle in for the ride pal.  They're open late night and are pretty much the perfect way to cap off a Friday or Saturday night downtown. Also, I went another time Sunday afternoon, and there was a lady selling fresh caramel churros out of a plastic Walmart bin. Do yourself a favor and buy like ten of em.  Cash only, and helps if you speak Spanish."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Bland, pasty, mystery contents in my burrito.  ...which took quite a while to make with only one other table occupied. It wasn't good.  We won't return. There are much better options nearby. I predict they will not last long. Pity."}
{"text":"(16th & Van Buren, BLUE tarp food trucks, next to Jack in the Box) Great tacos, burritos, (chicken, pork, meat, shrimp, fish) tostadas, mexican soup called cocktails of shrimp, fish, octopus (whatever you like), fresh water drinks (horchata, jimaica, etc), even mexican style hot dogs. Everything's pretty cheap.  *no restroom. does have covered picnic tables.   THIS IS FOOD TRUCK FOOD."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on our way from the airport and was very pleased to find some great street tacos. I had lengua tacos and my coworker had carnitas. Both were delicious and the salsa was a nice topper. For the soda drinkers out there, they have Mexican Coke! The one with real cane sugar! Only disappointment is that I've been traveling to Phoenix for work for over two years and only just now found this place."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the food and prices. My favorite are the chicharron and Barbacoa tacos. TRULY DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Chicharron Carne asada Lengua  All three great street tacos in terms of taste. Good flavor from all three tacos and seasoned very well. The chicharron was good, but the lengua and carne asada definitely beat it. The tacos came out to be 6.50, which for me is a tad pricey for streets tacos. I would come back again, and try out the burritos they had to offer.  Note: Cash only"}
{"text":"Items Ordered: (6) Carne Asada Taco & a Mexican Coke.  Total Bill: $14  Overall Satisfaction:  Full bellys late at night = True Bliss  What a little gem!  We are always looking for late night places to eat. It's usually 10 or 1030 by the time football practice gets done and we never have a plan for dinner. So having reliable late night places to eat is a invaluable resource.  We keep describing this place as a quintessential Hole in the Wall Restaurant. But the truth is there's not even a wall for the whole to be in. It's literally a parking lot with a couple of food trucks and a couple of impromptu patios under tarps. And here's the best part... they're open til 2 a.m. . And they're busy. Not so busy that you can't sit down and enjoy your meal, but way more busy than you'd expect a food truck to be at 11 o'clock at night in the middle of the week.  So what about the food? We really only had the carne asada, but let us tell you this, it was on point. Meat cabbage cilantro and onion are all chopped up fine and the tacos are literally stuffed. They have an option to add extra meat for a dollar but the tacos are already so full we don't know where you would put all that extra meat. Overall a very good food truck experience in the heart of Phoenix. We felt like Anthony Bourdain will be sitting there one night reviewing the place."}
{"text":"If you want some genuine street tacos like the ones you get in Los Angeles, this is the place to go.  I always get a mixed burrito of Lengua and Pastor.  Their tacos are great, carnitas, cabeza, lengua, tripas, chicharron and asada."}
{"text":"If you want some genuine street tacos like the ones you get in Los Angeles, this is the place to go.  I always get a mixed burrito of Lengua and Pastor.  Their tacos are great, carnitas, cabeza, lengua, tripas, chicharron and asada."}
{"text":"Really really fresh Mexican food. Great service and great food. Everything is made fresh in house and you can definitely tell. They were also able to customize any and all plates.( vegetarian, spicy, mild, minus onions etc)  . Go check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent torta with pulled pork. Big and tasty with good bread. Fast service made it easy to stop by for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Probably the best street tacos I've had since moving here. This place is the true sense of the word food truck. You don't really need to speak Spanish well to order dos or tres tacos de Carne asada. But the area is sketchy and saw a drugged up guy walk across the parking lot to use the Porta potties against the wall. This review is based mainly on the food, if it were for location it'd take a star.  The eating area can have hungry and persistent flies. I fled once I saw a few bees circle my drink. I am deathly afraid of bees so I bolted to my car. That being said, I recommend taking it to go if flies and bees are not at your tolerance level. But I'd definitely come back and take my food to go."}
{"text":"Was craving street tacos & Yelp steered us here. We tried the carne asada, carnitas & al pastor - carnitas was my favorite. It was very moist and tender. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla to share. Stay away! It was super greasy. The grease had soaked through the paper bag completely by the time we got home. I thought the grease had filtered out into the bag but nope more grease as I picked up a slice - it covered my hands. This was inedible.  Verdict - tasty street tacos but stay away from the quesadilla!"}
{"text":"So we were looking for some good old Mexican food on a Sunday night of  study overload, and were disappointed. We saw on Yelp that it was rated 4.5/5 stars...what a waste!!  My friend had two tacos de cabeza and two tacos de lengua and she said that it was mediocre and not surprised at all. I had the chicken quesadilla and wasn't pleased very much either. I asked for everything on it and let's just say they're VERY VERY onion happy. In hopes that the horchata would make up for the lack of taste in food, we were AGAIN let down. It was watered down."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. Reasonably priced. They're open late everyday - past midnight until 1 am I think. It's cash only, and they're located in a dicey part of town. But the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is probably the closest thing to tacos in Mexico taste. ***Cash only*** Tacos are $2 regular size tortilla, the guac salsa is delicious and you gotta try vampiros which are a fire toasted tortilla with melted cheese and meat on top, yummoooo"}
{"text":"After three years of living in Arizona I finally found my go to taco truck!! I am from Cali and there was always one spot I'd go to and my standards for good street tacos were really high. Finally I found this place and it's so close to my house! Home made tortillas, YAASSS!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this a 3.5 if I could.   It's definitely your authentic Mexican street tacos with homemade corn tortillas. I find it hard to find decent al pastor tacos in the valley, which keeps me coming back. Price is pretty good as well for your typical meats ($2 a taco). There's a few items on the taco list that they charge for $3. Not sure if they have a taco Tuesday discount.  I've had the al pastor, pollo asado, and carne asada. All are pretty descent, but could hold back on the chicken though. I do find that they all lack flavor, and could use more salt. I find myself having to drench the tacos in their guac sauce and red mild sauce (these also lack flavor as well).   You can also ask for cooked onions and Serrano peppers, which gives a lot more flavor to the tacos.  Overall, it's nothing I crave, unless I want al pastor tacos for a good price. They have a few spots through out the valley. Also have specific trucks for seafood/mariscos."}
{"text":"On my trip to Phoenix, I set out to find something local and unique to the tune of cow head and tongue tacos and a Sonoran hot dog from a taco truck. From what I can tell, La Frontera is one of the only places you can get a Sonoran hot dog during the day. Most of them are parked later in the day, ready for bar goers. The funny thing was is that there were actually two trucks on site, and only one of them served the dogs so I ended up at both.   Chicago has its celery salt and pickles, and New York has its sauerkraut and mustard, but in Phoenix, they've got Sonoran dogs. Hot dogs are never my go to food but this combination is BOMB. The Sonoran-style hot dog, found also in Tucson and in neighboring Sonora, Mexico, is a hot dog wrapped in mesquite-smoked bacon then cooked on a grill then topped with beans, grilled onions, fresh onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise, cream sauce, mustard and Jalapeno salsa or sauce and served on bread and often with a side fresh-roasted chili. It originated in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora.  I also ordered a cow head (brain) and cow tongue taco. I'd had cow tongue as a youngster so I wasn't too surprised but the meat of both was mushier than I'd like. I'm also not a huge fan of the corn tortillas but the cilantro and cucumbers were refreshing.  I felt a little out of place here.  Everyone else was Mexican and non-English speaking but we managed.  Despite the language barrier, I got what I wanted and he even knew I didn't know where to get the Mexican coke I ordered so he stepped out of the truck to show me the ice chest along the front.  I thought that was pretty nice.  Cash only! SUPER cheap."}
{"text":"After hearing about La Fontera for years I decided to give this place a try today for lunch since I don't work to far from it and it was tolerable to sit outside for a change.   While I pulled up there was the food truck then a blue tarp with 5 tables under it for shade. I went about 11:45 to beat the lunch hour rush and I'm glad I did. While all tables were full I asked a guy if I could share his table of 4 since it was only him and he was perfectly fine with that.   The menu wasn't huge but what they had was perfect. Burritos, tacos, tostadas and a few other things. I did notice that nothing was over $4. They had about 6 different main items (meat, chicken, etc...) for anything you ordered. I had the Barbacoa Beef Burrito (beef, beans, rice, cabbage, cheese). When it arrived it was HUGE! it came with a side of limes, peppers and cucumbers (yummy). This thing had to weigh over a pound! Soooo I thought, great it's wrapped in foil so what I don't eat I'll take home for dinner...WRONG! I ate the entire thing! The tortilla was awesome and so fresh too (huge bonus for sure as I love homemade tortillas).   They have two sauces you can put on anything as well as the bottles are on each table. One is a red sauce in which I didn't try but the green creamy sauce I did and it was awesome! I put it on each bite. Needless to say I won't be even slightly hungry for dinner tonight!!!   This is one of the best burritos I've had in a very long time so I will for sure be back soon! Especially since it's going to start cooling off her (hopefully....)."}
{"text":"Finally I have found a taco stand to replace my old favorite. The tortillas are hand made so you won't get that sour tortilla taste that you get at some places. Everything is finely chopped which to me is a deal breaker.   I brought my Mom and sister here for a late lunch and we ordered 3 tacos, a quesadilla, gotta, & three drinks and only paid $18! For me that was a steal especially for the portions.  The quesadillas are pretty big and the tacos are just the right size. I will tell you this its in a sketchy area but you can always order them to go if you don't want to stay and eat there.   I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I stopped last night due to convenience, and to once again compare with my new-found jewel for street tacos, Carniceria Guasave at 3500 W. McDowell.  Since tripa is one of my faves, I ordered two of those, and one chicharrone. I had to wonder if the tripe had been adequately cleaned, it was that bad. Thankfully, the pork was ok, somewhat like al pastor in presentation, without all of the spice. What's with the shredded cabbage? For $3 per taco, I think they could step-up to cilantro.   From now on, I'll only stop here in a dire foodie emergency."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking it's a food truck how good can it be? Well let me tell you it was delicious and if you're ever in the area and hungry you will not regret stopping here. They have 2 different food trucks one that has Sonoran hot dogs and seafood. The other has tacos, burritos, and other Mexican food dishes. It was four of us that ordered different foods and we all tried each other's, and I have to say every single thing I tried was soooooo delicious!!! I can't say that enough to be honest. I also had an horchata which I can tell was homemade and not made from the powder packages so super thumbs up there. They also have two seating areas and plenty of parking. I know that every time im in the area I will stop by and make sure to show up with an empty belly."}
{"text":"Hungry. Late night 1am Taco run. Difficult location to find maybe for the first time, next to a Jack In The Box in the back area parking lot. Maybe harder to spot from the side of the road. Just a food truck. Ordering was easy, preferably done in Spanish. They have the menu on the side so it's not too hard.   Cash only*  Wait time was fairly quick, around like 5 minutes. But then again there wasn't that long of a line.  I tried the carne asada, Barbacoa, al pastor tacos.  I believe the carne asada was my favorite one it was very moist. The Tacos hit the spot when you're hungry at night Comes with lime and cucumbers. And they have to Salsas the green and the red sauce. I prefer to mix both the sauce on the taco.  There may be some cats around, if you're allergic to them. But there was only one.  Overall, a good experience and probably my top taco place for now.  No issues with parking as this is in a parking lot.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Brush up on your Spanish and get ready to try the best burrito Phoenix has to offer. This food truck doesn't seem like much at first glance. It sits in an open parking lot by the Jack in the Box on 16th and Van Buren. Tables are under a covered area and you'll likely see some people there trying to sell random knickknacks. It's possible you may even hear a couple ambulances go by. But if you're in the area, this is a must stop.  This is a local hangout spot and you'll be pressed to act the part. Check out the menu, use Google translate if you have to, and you'll likely need to make your order in Spanish. If that doesn't scream, \"this is authentic,\" I don't know what does. Pro tip: the food truck is cash only. They're open until 2am and I can assure you, there are still people lined up at 1:45am to get food.  The burrito de chile verde with carne de cebrada (shredded beef) is an instant classic and only costs $6. They'll serve it to you in foil while it's still incredibly hot, and give you a plate of cucumber to help you cool down. If you're not a fan of shredded beef, I had a friend substitute the beef with pollo (chicken) and another friend went a bit more wild and substituted in cabeza (brain). Get the salsas too as they are amazing. Just don't overindulge on the red if you can't handle spicy food.  Apart from the food, make sure to get the horchata which is $2.25. It comes in a huge cup, is an amazing complement to the meal, and provides you that extra bit of sweetness to make the whole experience complete.  Seriously, what are you waiting for? This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Found this place last night and it was great. The food was awesome and the service was excellent. The fajitas and tacos were really good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a taco truck on a parking lot with tables and chairs available to sit. The place is clean and the tacos are delicious. The tortillas look and taste homemade and they give you a lot of meat. I brought the hubby here for his birthday because he specifically asked for tacos. We came here around 10:30pm on a Saturday night after a show at the Herberger Theater. We ordered cabeza, lengua, chicharon, and carne asada tacos. All meats were tender and flavorful, so you don't need to add anything else but they do give you two different salsas, limes, and some cucumber slices with your order. The cabeza meat was juicy which I like. We both ordered jamaica juice and were pleased that it wasn't too sweet. Sanitation wise, I really like that someone takes your order and money, then a different person makes your food. The hubby loved it here and says we're coming back!"}
{"text":"Incredible quick service. Tacos were prepared to my specifics. Very tasty and authentic!"}
{"text":"Finally found the spot for street tacos. Been here twice in two days. The chicharon tacos are amazing the carnitas burrito is loaded with meat and beans. Barbacoa tacos are so juicy and full of flavor. Feels like I'm in Cali eating at tacos trucks in East La or Santa Ana. Great place for some late night munchies and you can pick up some boot leg DVDs"}
{"text":"A for effort for La Frontera Mexican Restaurant in Austin Village. I ordered the Enchiladas Cremosas and it was bland and the chicken was dry. The constant fruit fly at our table was a lovely companion. Made me wonder how clean the kitchen really was. I get that flies come on the fruit and veggies but come on. Bleach the sink, empty the trash can and get rid of the nuisance. All in all, drive 2 miles down the road and get excellent food at La Unica!"}
{"text":"I would always here my sister talk about going to the frontera and never asked her what it was....so finally my friends called me up and told me they were picking me up and taking me there...the food was great!!! I ate so much I went into a food coma"}
{"text":"I love this place. I stick out like a sore thumb being the only white guy there every time but I don't care. The food is worth it. The tacos and burritos are amazing. If you come in the evening get the Sonoran hot dogs and they are so bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had tacos and a steak quesadilla. Yumm!! Great food truck! They also have a canopy like structure with tables."}
{"text":"I was visiting on business from Wisconsin and met up with my wifes uncle John from California and we went hunting for authentic Mexican food.  At first I yelped a place in the ghetto that was closed up, prostitutes and drug dealers on every corner.  As we were driving back toward safety, I saw this truck under bright lights with a tarp and make shift tables underneath with people sitting and eating. I didn't care if we got mugged, I was hungry and there were plenty of witnesses. Neither of us speak Spanish, but the old dude in the truck spoke just enough to take our order and money. I had a ham and avocado quesadilla and Uncle John had  a carne asada burrito. His stuff looked so good I decided to try that too. It was a little bit-o-awesome.  And they have this avocado sauce that was so smooth creamy and good. You would be a total moron not to eat here if you are in the 'hood. It sits near the corner of VanBuren and 16th St."}
{"text":"I arrived in Phoenix at around 9pm for a business trip, checked into my hotel, then realized I was hungry and everything around me was closed.  I pulled up yelp and looked for some cheap latenight eats, and found this place.  Getting to it is a bit of a pain if you aren't local as the roads are split by their light-rail system, even when they are one way, so being on the wrong side of the tracks, means you can't turn to get here.  I wasnt sure what to expect when I pulled up, but what I found was pretty awesome. Standing alone in the middle of a parking lot, at midnight, was La Frontera. A jack in the box around the corner seemed to be the only place open other than this, that I could see. But here I was, with literally 20+ other people in the middle of the night, getting some awesome food.  The selection is pretty standard. Tacos, Burritos, Tacos, etc. with your choice of the normal meats (Asada, Pork Verde, Chorizo, etc. The staff primarily speak Spanish, but  it wasnt an issue to order, Although they did call my number in Spanish, so I could see that getting confusing if you don't know Spanish)  The food was FANTASTIC. Best Carne Aasda and Chorizo I have had in a long time. Fresh toritllas, great tasting meat, good fillings, a good size, and cheap. Tonights  my last night and I am going to try and make it over again before I leave Arizona, as it was that good."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! The street tacos are delicious and so are the burritos! It's a food truck so be prepared to eat outside; the tables laid out are very clean and there is always someone walking around cleaning up food and offering help. The service is great! The Horchata is also great!"}
{"text":"street tacos done good! (from a food truck)"}
{"text":"Have been going to this place since I was little and it is so good! Definitely the only place I go to to get the best tacos and quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Eh - I was really excited to come here on the advice of some fellow taco loving friends but wasn't impressed. On a Sunday afternoon after a trail run I ordered a Carne Asada, Al Pastor and Carnitas taco from the first truck and from the mariscos truck ordered one fish and one shrimp taco.  The only thing that was kind of above average was the shrimp taco, which I usually don't like. The fish taco had that \"fishy\" smell that isn't supposed to accompany food to put in the body.. I took a bite and didn't finish it, I would've taken it back but I had already left and live in the east valley.   The food from the real meat truck was much better but not great. All of the tacos were just average and VERY greasy. The meat had a lot of fat and wasn't of a quality cut (grisly and fatty)  The flavor was okay after being doused in the red sauce, but lacking anything distinct. For $2 a taco I expected better and would go to the taco truck at 7th Ave and Camelback if you want a quality street taco for half the price."}
{"text":"My coworker told me about this food truck saying it had some pretty decent authentic tacos. I have both their carnitas and asada tacos and I definitely approve. The only down side is this place is cash only, but that is definitely to be expected from a food struck in this area."}
{"text":"Very yummy!!! Wish they used cilantro instead of cabbage but other than that, very tasty."}
{"text":"they got bomb ass, especially the tacos de pastor fuck those are bombbbb  & they also got this cute ass guy who takes the orders, what more y'all want??"}
{"text":"Great food. I used to go to La Unica in Indian Trail, but this restaurant  is very comparable in flavor and freshness to La Unica."}
{"text":"Really good Carnitas and Carne asada tacos. Gotta try the green salsa. Bomb.com.   This place is definately a hole in the wall with solid reasonably priced mexican food. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Great food!  Prices are a little high on the tacos (2.50 each and cash only), but definately worth it especially since they make the tortillas when you order.  Couldn't ask for better food just wish they had a sit down restaurant"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Phoenix for Sonoran tacos, and hot dogs especially late at night! It's super authentic Mexican food, street tacos, burritos quesadillas etc. I recommend getting them all! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"By far the absolute worst service ever! An hour wait for food. Chips lacked salt, salsa was bland and the iced tea was warm. No drink refills and no apologies when we finally demanded to go boxes.  Terrible, terrible food and completely overpriced.  Yuck. Just yuck."}
{"text":"We are always in search of great burritos and because we travel often it can be hard to find. We found this taco truck through yelp and are so glad we did. Not only do they have great burritos, but there is also a mariscos truck. We haven't tried the mariscos, only because they were closing early so we missed out. Definitely our go to place when we find ourselves in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Taco place ever!! Love them will always eat here! Come here 1am and still serving the best tacos !"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their tacos. Very reasonable price. Horchata was ridiculously too sweet and tasted very artificial. The food was solid, though.   Went twice on my trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day.  I think they moved to a new location, which wasn't easy to find, but I figured it out after a few minutes.  Service was good, food was good, no complaints.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"New name is Poblanito . . Still trying to rev things up , new restaurant but I think the food is fresher than most and the place has a manager with character, Jose .."}
{"text":"Great street tacos! Got the carne asada and lengua. These are pretty authentic street tacos, however, it seemed a little pricey for street tacos. I would definitely come back and try the burritos they had."}
{"text":"Storefront restaurant next to the Harris Teeter on Chestnut. Very little ambience, minimal furnishings but very clean. The salsa is good and the chips are crispy. I had fabulous veggie enchiladas-mushrooms and spinach with rice and black beans served in an edible taco bowl.   Average prices.   Now closed 2016"}
{"text":"I've been to Mexico. These are not Mexican street tacos.  The location and hours are great for me, it's on 16th Street (east side of street) and is open 24 hours.   The menu varies from burritos to tacos and a few things in-between.  They speak functional English there, so you can order, but picking up may be difficult if you don't know how to count in Spanish (they announce order numbers in Spanish). I had to help a non-speaking couple get their order.  The people that frequent this place range from families to cholos. Just depends on what time of day you go. During the daytime, I would prefer to go to Rancho Market a block away (they have better al pastor tacos).   I ordered 5 tacos, 5 different meats. The pork tacos all blended together flavor wise, it was hard to really tell the difference between the al pastor and the adobada. The cabbage they put in was dry, and deterred from the flavor. I took the cabbage out of the other ones after the first taco. The salsa is where this place tanks. It's rather bland and the spice is way off.   Their menu is confusing at first, but stare at it for 2 minutes and it starts to make sense. Essentially it asks you what type of meat you want for taco, burrito, burro etc etc.  All in all, I'm disappointed considering the hype around this place. I still drive an extra 20 minutes to Super Burrito, which has better salsa for the tacos (albeit their tacos are also not that great)."}
{"text":"People I'm from LA if you could avoid this please avoid it this guy sells burned meat and shitty quality save ur money i daught this is even real meat i called to complain all he could say was sorry para la jente que no sabe ingles este lugar vale madre este guey vende pura mierda"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I always get the carne asada tacos and the carnitas tacos. They're cash only."}
{"text":"Had the burrito texano for lunch. Lunch was good a bit pricey but very good. Wait staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant is new but definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"We were running an errand and stopped here for a bite to eat after work. Hands down the BEST Mexican food in Matthews and the best I've had in Charlotte! The portions are great and the food is full of flavor and quality. The chiles rellenos were really good and the fajitas were absolutely delicious. So glad we found this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good late-night food for those who need a bit of post-bar food. My friends and I were there last week and the food was amazing. Wish they had more of the \"side dishes\" (lettuce, onions, etc.) available on the side. Maybe they had it at an earlier point in time, but I'm not sure.  Make sure you know some Spanish though. Ordering is easier that way."}
{"text":"The place has amazing hotdogs! Hands down some of the best hotdogs in the valley of the sun that I've had the privilege to try. The service is fast and friendly. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to try a great Sonoran hotdog, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"La Frontera is the surprise find of the decade for me. In a city full of street side taco trucks, you'd never think that one would be so tremendous, but there is a reason La Frontera's truck is in the same place every day of the year. It's un-flipping-believably good.   Upon first inspection, La Frontera is a mangled parking lot full of haphazardly parked cars, a few bums walking by every now and then, and a lot of neighborhood folks. The unassuming \"restaurant\" is made up of folding tables and chairs, a blue tarp as a sunscreen, and a truck full of awesomeness. The menu has all the Sonoran Mexican favorites like tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and chicharonnes. One will order at the counter using as much broken Spanish as possible, while the employee uses as much broken English as possible. Eventually you will find a medium, and you'll complete your order of amazing. When your number is called in Spanish, you'll get your order along with the typical limes, radishes, cucumbers, and salsas. Upon request, they have grilled jalapenos available at no charge.   The food here is truly fantastic. The tortillas they use are fresh, homemade, gooey flour tortillas. Their meat is grilled to perfection and marinated exquisitely, which is something you very rarely find in a Mexican street food shop. My pick is the Burrito de Carne Asada, a large flour tortilla teeming with hot grilled beef, beans, salsa rojo, onions, and a bit of cilantro. If you're a taco lover, you'll love the barbacoa beef tacos, a Mexican style BBQ meat with an almost briny, indescribible taste. Wash your meal down with one of their many bottled Mexican sodas, and consider yourself lucky that you got to try one of the finest examples of Mexican street food in the state. I'm so spoiled now and hold just about every burrito in town to this standard... which has led to many disappointments.  Be forewarned that La Frontera is cash only, and basic knowledge of Spanish is recommended, though not necessary. Just remember these phrases and you'll be good \"Burrito de carne asada, con todo\" \"para llevar\" \"es todo\" and remember your number. You'll never desire any other burrito from America's again, they just don't hold a candle to La Frontera, especially at twice the price."}
{"text":"The best fast food Mexican I have had in town, complete with super cold Mexican sodas on ice. I had a barbacoa, lengua, tripita and chicharon taco.  2 hours later and I am still full, and haven't made a made clenching dash to the bathroom yet, so I'd say it was a good meal.  The chicharon was delicious, like a taco full of bacon!!!"}
{"text":"Hand made tortillas, mexican coke bottles, best tacos in Arizona. Do I need to say more?"}
{"text":"Just like my fellow Yelp compadres Jimmy P, Cher-Yee L & Sohan P, I'm a huge fan of La Frontera!  Major props to Cher-Yee for introducing me to this place in summer 2017. I was a little leery when he gave me the cross-streets -- it's not exactly in the greatest area of Phoenix -- and the parking lot is a bit of a hot mess express. What location lacks for makes up for everything else. You know it's authentic Mexican if they serve cabeza (juicy tender meat from around the head of a cow), of which I've ordered every time.   Pro tip: no hablen ingles, so might want to bring Google Translate if you're one who no habla espa√±ol. Or just say \"Yo quiero _____\".   Get a cabeza burrito! They're seriously almost the size of my lower arm. And only $6 cash! Add in horchata (one size only, also the size of my lower arm) and you'll be well-fed for less than $10.  In the last 2 months, I've been in NorCen Phoenix 2xand purposefully driven to La Frontera on my way home. One of those times I was able to save most of the burrito for the next day's lunch. Makes for amazing leftovers!   Buen comida!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Phoenix. They really are amazing. Who cares if you have to sit next to 16th Street?  They are STREET tacos!!  The taco itself is heavenly. Spongy soft fresh with NO OIL. The fillings are heavenly. I'm partial to pastor. Hubby likes carnitas. I don't know what else to say but PERFECT. Too bad Yelp doesn't let you put ten stars.  I feel completely comfortable there alone."}
{"text":"My fourth time coming here, I ordered 2 el pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. They were very delicious and the carne was fresh! I didn't have to wait long for the tacos to be made."}
{"text":"Came upon this place after me and the hubby didn't want to end our night with Filibertos or any other fast food chain. Yelp to the rescue! Saw that they had good reviews so we decided to check it out, and glad we did! The tacos were a good size, the price was right and the flavor was there. Unlike other taco places I've tried since moving here, this one reminded me of the taquerias in San Francisco.  also my husband liked the tacos which is saying a lot because he's picky with the foods he would actually admit to liking.  Will definitely be coming back here again! :)"}
{"text":"It's amazing, we'll be back! Long over due visit to try this place! Not even sure where to start this one...so many moving parts to this review ~ try to stay with me! La Frontera truck numero #1 ~ we ordered carne asada tacos, quesadilla de carne asada and all of was so delicious. I loved the really small diced cabbage on everything! Next ~ Truck numero #3 we ordered an obscene amount of Sonoran hot dogs! They were freaking amazing! So while we were walking 20-30 steps to get from #1 to #3 we purchased a fresh donut, it was delicious! While we sat at the table of truck #3, another vendor came up with fresh pan de calabaza (pumpkin empanadas) they were really good! As we sit here stuffed, we plan our next trip here. You will not regret coming here! Until next time feast your eyes on these pics! Wasn't able to slow down and take pics of everything...oops"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! Tortilla are fresh, not store bought. Drove 23 miles out of the way just for them."}
{"text":"Work night shift for a hospital downtown and I always end up having Taco cravings in the middle of the shift. Luckily La Frontera is open until 2am during the weekdays which is very convenient for me and all my coworkers at night. The tacos are okay, not the greatest tacos but very far from the worst, the salsa's, limes and salt can help you tweak them and make them ideal for your taste but what I love and enjoy the most about this roadside taco truck is that you will get better treatment and hospitality than you would at a fancy sit in restaurant. The people who work the truck go the extra mile to make sure your food is out quick and that everything you ordered is as you wanted and great service is to be appreciated nowadays! They also have a great horchata and a big selection among quesadillas, tortas, and burritos. I highly recommend going here as oppose to the filibertos up the street on a late night!"}
{"text":"Came here after just landing in Phoenix to grab some late night tacos, it's pretty cool that the trucks have their own parking lot and there are two different trucks with what seems like two different menus, but after the novelty, the food isn't all that amazing. The tacos came out to about $1.50 each, which is slightly more expensive than what I'm used to, especially for tacos of this quality.  The service however was great, and they were super friendly about explaining their menu and what all the different meats were to anyone who didn't know, which is not as common as you would think in food trucks. I wouldn't say the quality here is amazing, but if you're coming around the area and looking for some dirty street tacos to grab a quick bite and maybe even hang out with friends in the parking lot, come by and give frontera a shot."}
{"text":"Looks a bit warehousey on the outside, but it's really nice on the inside. Clean floors, clean booths and a stage at the front where a band was setting up as we got ready to leave.  I went with the steak fajitas. A good portion of steak and a lot of onions and green peppers. Enough that four burritos weren't enough. Of course, served on the usual sizzling metal platter with sides of pico and rice and beans.  It wasn't any more special than a dozen other Mexican restaurants within five miles, other than the fact that it appeared way newer and way cleaner."}
{"text":"People who've written reviews here must not have been served the same food I just had.   Pulled up to a parking lot with two different taco trucks that said Frontera 1 and Frontera 3. Okay... battle of the taco trucks maybe..?  Nope, one serves your typical meat tacos and the other serves seafood tacos and hot dogs.   Definitely will need basic Spanish when ordering here. Luckily, I know enough Spanish to get me by. Ordered 3 tacos de asada and 1 pastor.   I was curious to check out Frontera 3, so I walked on over and figured might as well give it a try. Ordered taco de Cameron and hot dog (since reviews raves about it)  Here comes the food: Asada tacos - small burnt chips of beef with a hard tortilla. Definitely not worth $3 Pastor - slight hint of pastor but too burnt to tell Tacos de Cameron - order it empanizado because that's the only way to order. But maybe you shouldn't order at all. Nothing like what you can get in Mexico.  Hot dog - small dog, big bun. My appetite wasnt there anymore while I was eating this so maybe it isn't the best evaluation.   Overall, probably won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Got tacos with lengua, cabeza, and all pastor and they were all perfect. So many places have mediocre lengua, but this was flavorful and moist. Same with the cabeza. Frankly, the al pastor was better than perfect; the marinade had a deep southwestern red chili flavor. It was a little too intense for my wife, but I loved it. Go here!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos. I've said it before and I'll say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food. Eat here before your next flight!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for  Mexican food. Homemade corn tortillas, delicious meat, salsa's great, guacamole, and they give you pickled carrots. This place has been my favorite for years. I wish they had a location in Nortth Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some amazing authentic Mexican tacos! I am a big fan of weird meats like Lengua and Cabeza and they had them! I ordered a cabeza and carne asada burrito and lengua taco and it was amazing! If you want some authentic mexican food, come here and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Orale!  This place is GREAT!  Ask the cab/UBER/Lyft driver to swing by this joint late night, after the bar...PERFECT drunky-pants food :)"}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious and fresh, but the service was awesome! Servings were very plentiful. The queso was a little too spicy for me but was so good that I couldn't help but eat it! Our waitress was attentive, helpful, and very nice! We would definitely visit this place again. Business seemed slow for a Friday night - not sure why when the food was so great!"}
{"text":"Place is near by my home, so decided to give it a try. I love asada burritos, so thats what i came for. Burrito was Massive, asada and tripa was my choice.  Plenty of meat, and the right ingredients on the side. Price is decent, and the choices from the menu are a handful. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Craving some good tacos!? This place is the best tacos in down. I love their barbacoa tacos with the flour tortillas and all the toppings. The meat is so tasty that you crave it for day. ;) also there's a lady by the food truck that is selling churros and omg they are so good! Tried the vanilla filled churros best churro ever! Better than the Disney land churros."}
