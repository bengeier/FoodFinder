{"text":"Wow!  I think the results of your trip depend  largely on your server and the time of night. We showed up at 8:00 and got out at 9:30.  Service was really WEAK and the food was so, so - in fairness, we'd tried items that were not on the list of favorites but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Mad respect for new exec chef Justin who brings a lot of talent and passion to Atomic.  His rustic refined cooking is something that has been sorely missing from Vegas for a long time.  Haven't had a chance to work through much of the menu yet, but Kingsley Wing is great, harrissa carrots a classic  (coriander cream, yum), and the Cuban is a flavor bomb of porky goodness.  Chef is also a madman, already putting out fantastic specials nonstop.  The chicken livers with mushroom ravioli and greens was amazing.

Drinks are also fantastic.  Should sell the Glass Onion as an aromatic mist to be enjoyed throughout the day.    And be careful you don't get so loaded your inner fat kid starts crushing bread pudding at the bar \"to sober up.\""}
{"text":"Wasn't busy as we came for an early evening but as we sat here the place started to fill up. They have a large bar and large booths, some high tables and some low tables inside, outdoors on a large patio are low tables. The menu has a small but good selection. We opted for LuLu pretzel with 2 dips one a spicy mustard  and the other a smoked beer cheese both were awesome. Wedges and blue was good- the dressing had good flavor but it was to thin. We shared the KJ prime rib dip, very good ! Our waiter Recommended the Frostie & fries, the ice cream was awesome except I wanted more- I'd lose the waffle fries and make it a little bigger and add waffle cone pieces and crushed malt balls!"}
{"text":"Freemont has become such a bear to get to with all the traffic, but I  got bored with the same  ten restaurants in the neighborhood. So glad i did. They had a dish I have not had since leaving New York.  Steak tartare!!! That won me over.  It was served the way i like it abd it was not over killed with spice. The service was outstanding for a crowded week end. I would  definitely come back for a bigger meal!   It was definitely worth braving Fremont Street for."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Their sandwiches are the best! The hostess is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Chef Justin is amazing!!  Everything was exquisite from the start to finish!!  Drinks were equally amazing!!!  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to go for a while now and was not disappointed. The drinks and food were top notch, I had the braised lamb neck over black lentils and turnips, I'd put that in my top 5 meals of my life! People, get down there and check this place out."}
{"text":"$16 burger was good but expensive.  I miss the old menu.  The food was good but limited odd choices. Cuban sandwich also good but expensive. $13 glass for basic wine.  Will not return although I go to atomic bar often."}
{"text":"New chef is friendly and accommodating for vegans! He made the best off menu vegan pesto pasta and a lentil dish with lots of veggies. Super yum! The only thing I am missing is the Savory Sally. All time favorite drink, please bring it back!"}
{"text":"The Cigar City sandwich is what dreams are made of. It's the most perfect Cuban sandwich I have ever had. And Those Potatoes...really that's what they are called...are dangerously good. Like you can't stop eating them. Sat at the bar, enjoyed a Firestone DBA and great service, and left very happy and very full. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"They must have a genius chef because the food is phenomenal.  I love food more than anything. I'm like that raccoon drowning just so he can eat more.  We had the pretzel - which kicked ass - the cheese sauce number was perfect, mustard perfect. We had mac bites - delicious.  Burgers - delicious. And I had steak tartare ... now there was a tiny glob of effing mayo on it, but not mixed in. It was good.  I don't prefer the toasts it came with, but it was over all fantastic.  The drinks are completely overpriced - but it is what it is.  The atmosphere is nice.  Service was impeccable!!! So important to a new restaurant and they nailed it.  Food came out fast. Can't say enough good things...other than the diversity of the menu - hot dogs to steak tartare. Impeccable! (Even the ranch sauce is great)"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! The bartenders Katie and Chase were so nice! Thank you for the great sazerac!"}
{"text":"We visited recently to see what the Chef had done. We sat down, as a group discussed how the inside is not what we expected. It was. Clean, open, appropriately lite, all around great atmosphere. We were greeted by Justin who was excellent. Extremely knowledgeable and passionate for the food. We ordered a few things to share and they came out when ready. Only issue was had which was more than justified was the tri tip special took a little longer, but Justin was uber apologetic and kept us updated on the refire. When the situation is properly handed in those situations it's no longer a big deal and Justin definitely handled it. All in all, great food, extensive beer offerings, with fun cocktails."}
{"text":"1st off, the view from the curb is deceiving. Our Lyft driver didn't even see it on the 1st pass. It's on the edge of downtown, away from the Fremont complex. Once you were inside, it's a nice atmosphere. Weird music mix, which we mostly liked (James Brown, Eagles, live Stones and then some more techno sounding stuff).

Our waiter was fantastic. He was passionate about the menu, which changes periodically. He described the menu items very well and highlighted ingredients as well as the eclectic changing list of craft beers available.

Food was great. We both had sandwiches. My wife said her eggplant sandwich was the best food she had on our stay. I had a tri tip BBQ sandwich, which is like a brisket cut of meat. Made with their own fresh rolls, they are both great. Highlight was dessert, though. Bread pudding reminded us of French toast, with a lovely spiced whip cream. Crunchy parts forced satisfied \"mmmmmms\" from us both. We left stuffed."}
{"text":"Great new addition to downtown Las Vegas! The Kitchen at Atomic has been long-anticipated, and it lived up to expectations. The lobster mac bites were a great starter. The scallops were tasty as well. I liked that they offered a separate cocktail menu from what is offered at Atomic next door. Will definitely return here soon!"}
{"text":"Don't tell anybody but this place rocks! 

Craft made drinks, delicious menu, out door seating, lots of parking no not a bar tender. I order them and drink them. Then I had a Chasing basil, it's aquavit, (new to me) pepper medley, elderflower, and a basil leaf. Refreshing!

Ahhhhhh."}
{"text":"Madly in love with the food at The kitchen at Atomic. All the food was flavorful and delicious. My husband and I shared The Board which is a homemade chicken liver mousse pot and a country pate. It was just divine. We had at the Foie Gras Toast. Officially, the best foie gras that we had since we moved to the USA (We are French.) The Chef nailed it! It was followed by the Hen Gone Wild Chichen & the Roasted Fresh Catch. Not only the flavors were insane, but the presentation is at the rendezvous. Nothing is left to chance, each dishes is studied to meet all your expectation. A great experience that we will recommend."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and great food will be found here. Arrived early on a Saturday with friends to try out this spot. We were some of the first diners that evening since it recently opened for business at 5pm. 

Dining area has a nice open feel and you can sit inside or on patio. We opted for the patio on a beautiful autumn day. Service was excellent. Our server went over the menu. Menu is simple and not too over the top. Great selection of gastro pub cuisine as well as a ribeye if you are feeling like a big spender, albeit you will only shell out $18. Menu items are inexpensive. Food is delicious. 

I went with the spaghetti squash. Excellent choice and very filling. I noticed my friend's appetizer was served on top of a huge waffle. Turns out that waffle was a pepperoni pizza infused waffle. That sounded to me like the greatest thing invented since sliced bread. It was my favorite thing on the menu. It was spot on. They only charged me $2 for it. It was like hitting a small jackpot on a slot machine. 

Drinks are great. Order up one of their signature cocktails or have a few beers. Excellent choice of craft beers available on draft. If you're feeling old school just hit up atomic liqours next door for some after dinner drinks like we did. 

Good food and service. Easy to find in downtown just a few minutes walk from the Fremont street experience if you're an out of towner like me. I always encourage visitors and my crew to get away from the hotels and hoopla to find the best eats Vegas has to offer. Try them out. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and space at K@A! The menu is refined, the space is modern, the crowd is grown-hipster. I've been by twice and the beer menu is a thing of wonder (the Chai on draft is perfect for fall!), but food execution seems to vary based on who's in the kitchen.

I love seeing beef tartare on a menu, and this one with cured egg yolk was sufficient but would benefit from a bit more seasoning. The Mexican-influenced Caesarette with grilled cactus and corn nuts was a surprise hit, and I really like the lime in the dressing. An entree-size version would make a great vegetarian dinner! Props for having a spaghetti squash shakshuka and a veggie burger for those who are unable to eat meat.

Chicken thighs are the cut I work with most at home, and I really liked the gravy and chicken-fried mushrooms used in the preparation here, but it was a touch salty and the cuts of meat were oddly small and rubbery in texture. My guy opted for the Surf & Turf and the giant tiger prawns were easily the star of this dish, while the tenderloin was a touch tough. We shared the PBJ Bread Pudding, made with brioche. The flavor profile successfully nailed the nutty-sweet balance, but the hot buttered sherry sauce was unnecessary and overpowering. Perhaps it's because we went in right at their 4PM opening, but the dessert was also cold in the middle as if it'd just been taken from the refrigerator. 

We were informed that they were training new kitchen staff, which may explain some of the missteps above. I really am a fan of the menu and the space, and will be revisiting to try other dishes (specifically the wings and scallops!) in the hopes that the execution will be a bit tighter than my last visit."}
{"text":"Love trying out new restaurants, especially on the strip! This restaurant is a definite stop. Make sure to get the waffle pizza, it is super yummy! I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Not what I would call good.  The place has potential.  The waiter looked like some off the street.  Hat backwards and pants hanging off his backside.  The food was subpar.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  It was very fatty, and did not have much flavor.   I could not finish it. On the good side, the bartender know her stuff and I got a great beer.  For the price, I would not recommend eating there.  Just get a beer and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fun fact alert! This place was in the movie Casino and it was a gas station that was made to look like it was located back east. 

Today it's a sexy bar & restaurant with garage doors that open to Freemont street which makes it that much more fun! People watching is epic down here! 

To the drinks and food. I'd like to say I had way too much to drink here and it's because every drink on their menu sounds delicious and they are.

My man loved the chicken wings which come with a pepperoni waffle with this blue cheese mousse thingy. The presentation is also very playful. The hot dog trio was delicious but I prefer my dogs with lots of grill marks. The caesar salad was my least favorite item with a weak dressing and bitter greens and the highlight of the evening was a fresh and warm soft pretzel that comes with spicy beer mustard and smoked beer cheese. So decadent and worth every bite! 

The desserts were ok, nothing memorable. 

Loved the space, ambiance and service so we'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items and get that pretzel again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Lots of beverage choices.  The wine list could use a bump,  but since they're known more for craft cocktails it works.  The food was good.  I had the ribeye crown.  It was just the right portion.  Not too much food,  but just enough to be filling.  Well prepared.  The bar staff was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! Jamie is a great server! This restaurant is a rare find! My hamburger was perfect!"}
{"text":"came here on a late friday night before closing time. the food server was your typical carbon copy Bearded hipster that gets hired for his looks. he annoyed me on so many levels that i am not gonna even elaborate. the food took long to come out but was delicious! ordered the black caeser. the only reason i'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place service Top Notch food pretty damn good I highly recommend it they have great specials, good atmosphere and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing for group dinner they have huge tables and food was so good it could be little bit pricy for certain menu but I didn't mind cuz everything was delicious. I was kinda disappointed when I got scallop entry cuz it was only 3 pcs but with appetizers and my husband's food I was satisfied. Will definitely go back I loved it"}
{"text":"The Kitchen at Atomic is a cozy little place that was highly recommended by several people. They have something for everyone. The atmosphere is welcoming and the waitstaff is excellent. We never felt rushed. Large wine list. Huge shrimp cocktail that was the best I've had. The cocktail sauce has a nice kick as well. 

Some of the best pasta I've had in a long time. Not too thick and heavy. All the dishes were a sight for the eyes, and the portions were large. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is great, recommended by a bartender at Commonwealth. Had delicious appetizers and drinks in a cool setting with great service. Recommend their pretzel. So nice to find spots like this even in high tourist areas like Fremont St."}
{"text":"Wow! Yesterday was my second time at The Kitchen at Atomic. What a change compared to the first time I went there! They made the right move with hiring Chef Justin.
Everything tastes so good, and with such an innovative and creative twist!
We shared the Board and the Foie Gras as appetizers. Then I had the Lamb and Lentils entree. It was dope.
We saved a little room for dessert and tried the Bread Pudding. And I can confirm it was the best bread pudding I ever had.
It is definitely a great place to have a casual dinner with friends. And I will go back very soon for sure to try their new menu!"}
{"text":"First off.. you would have no idea how good this spot is.Met some family here on a visit an WOW.This place exceeded expectations by far.The apps were incredible and the rest of the meal was incredible.My Lady loves craft beer and from what she told me this is THE PLACE to get something special."}
{"text":"Came in recently they changed the menu. All of the great dishes are gone!!  example, the shrimp mozzarella sticks, the prime rib dip ribe-eye ... Ordered what I asked was the best dishes on the new menu and they said the Cuban and the lamb lentil dish. It was sloppy,  greasy and over priced. Also asked for ranch for the fries and they said they don't have any. Beautiful place with lots of potential but big mistake with this new menu."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. First off the atmosphere is top notch. The food is not only delicious but leaves you ready for the next course. This is a favorite place of mine for late night fare and drinks. You may not be able to see atomic blast from the roof anymore but still worth stopping in for a meal that will blow you away."}
{"text":"After my third visit in as many weeks, it's safe to say I'm a fan. Downtown is my favorite part of Las Vegas, and it is partially because of the great bars and restaurants. 

Comfortable seating, a bar that is the showcase is the room, and great old photographs around the dining space. Their menu offers enough choices so everyone can find something, without having too many options, it's all condensed down to one page. 

For appetizers I've shared the wings on the pepperoni waffle, the mac and cheese bites, and the pretzel. The pretzel was my favorite, and honestly as a carb queen, I would be happy with getting it as my meal with the wedge salad. 


The burgers are why I keep going back. They have a rotating weekly selection, or a build your own. Tonight I went with the weekly, with balsamic reduction and caramelized onions, blue cheese, and bacon - yum! I love their buns and how they are branded with the logo. 


For dessert I've had the frosty, and also the donuts. The donuts were my favorite - definitely shareable as they were pretty large. I wasn't crazy about the lavender ice cream but that is just a flavor aversion I have. 

The frosty and fries were good but the frosty was a little hard to eat, next time I would just ask for a straw. 


I really like this place and would love to see a brunch option in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, and service. Got the vegan burger and the pretzel. Well done Atomic! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
Sharing a wall with Atomic liquors The Kitchen At Atomic is a big step up for what you might expect at a Downtown \"bar restaurant\" clean modern space with white brick and grey leather banquets give an elegant feel that is still comfortable enough for groups and casual encounters. Service Team is well trained and excited about their new food program, it's great when you can feel that type of positive energy from a team. 
Being on a primarily plant based diet can be troublesome but this menu has a ton of great options in all avenues. Bar food has elevated wings and Carnitas Fries as well as a killer burger. Dinner menu isn't huge but choices are well made, big bold flavors. Highlights are the harissa carrots, Ballerina pasta with drunken goat cheese & sea beans, Trout with English peas and the Urban Seed ( local greenhouses!! ) salad with cherry blossom vinaigrette.  
Looking forward to coming g back and trying the Tomahawk steak and Pork Chops!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT BURGERS! According to our very nice waitress, they grind the beef in house. They have a great bar menu and the house white wine is great and a bargain at $18. Very cool decor and there's a great patio too. I love the roll up garage-style windows/doors. There's plenty of parking behind and around the restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the steak tartare, wings and pizza waffle, triple bacon BLT and the Ribeye Crown. Steak tartare was absolutely delicious, I read that someone on here thought it was dry. Definitely not he case; I didn't care for the sauce and would've preferred a quail egg though. Wings were great, we ordered medium and they were gone within minutes. Triple bacon BLT Was good but a lot of food. The ribeye crown was ordered medium rare and was done perfectly. I'd love to come back!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar, Chase and Davey were super attentive! The cocktails were handcrafted and delicious!! An awesome server Justin brought me my food and was super friendly! What a fantastic staff! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chef Justin is doing things his way at Kitchen at Atomic.  Love the feel of the restaurant.  Chase the bartender was awesome.  We ordered a few items to try.  Bird two ways, mac and cheese and the carrots.  We can see he's putting his spin on things and will return to try more items.  Favorite was the Mac and cheese from this meal."}
{"text":"One of the great things about living in this day and age--the day and age of Yelp--is going to a town full of very touristy things, staying in the place full of tourists, but being able to suss out the really great finds. Such was the case with this restaurant. I was staying a few blocks away, and saw this pop up on the Yelp app as a hot new business. I was intrigued, but it was definitely not part of the main tourist section. If that had been my only reason for the trip--touristing--I would have never made it in. But lucky for me, I was there for more Yelpy reasons, and was able to get away from it all and chase down this place.

On the outside, you can see the story of two Atomics. The venerable old Atomic Liquors has been in that spot for ages. AGES. And the building has been maintained but still has the patina. Next door at the new kitchen, however, you have a new shine, a new patio, and it looks slick. Which is not to say it's not old. Apparently, it's an old mechanic's garage that had been there since earlier in the twentieth century. When it closed, Atomic bought the space with the idea of adding food to the booze side of things, spent a year remodeling, and opened a garage-esque restaurant as an homage. The old steel beams still hold it up, though they had to pour a new foundation.

Inside it's polished. It's nice but not fancy by any means. And over time, it will take on more character. I was greeted by Hannah at the door, who was sweet and suggested I take my party of one to the bar. There I was greeted by Chase, who was in the midst of serious ice making. They take their ice seriously, and he does the cooler trick to freeze clear ice, then has a fancy copper contraption to make the ice cubes into perfect spheres. I was mesmerized.

The menu is bifurcated into two schools of thought. On the one side, you've got bar food. Fried things, apps, shareable things. On the other, you've got nice, plated items. And it really is the kind of space that can pull both off. Back that up with an already proven bar program and you've got the makings of a flexible spot.

I went with the bar side of things. I started with a mini hot dog trio, which was actually a sizeable plate. I liked the Chicago dog best--Detroit dogs aren't my favorite, and the third (Columbian?) was topped with an adorable quail egg. On Chase's suggestion I got the burger and added avocado. They brand the bun with their logo which is a nice tough, and it was served with a big ol' pickle spear. They have a lot of options (21 by my count) to add on to your burger, which is kinda cool--you can certainly make it your own. It was super juicy, and although I don't love horseradish, the sauce was smooth enough to complement the whole thing.

I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to catch my flight, because I could have stayed for a while. Everyone was super cool, and there was a lot more menu to try. Total chill spot, probably will get rowdier on the weekends, but it's just far enough outside downtown that you're getting some good folks in the door, drawn to good drinks and a food program that looks like it will take hold."}
{"text":"Excellent server (Justen), service and excellent food. Plenty of parking outside too. Had the curry Fannie Bay oysters, huge portioned bone marrow, delicious seared foie gras, and the grass-fed, juicy, burger. Burger definitely top 3 in Vegas. Make sure to get fries extra crispy."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service at the bar. Had the ribeye crown, wings, scallops and lemon ricotta donuts. Mouth watering."}
{"text":"Excellent modern cozy atmosphere and really excellent food. Great drinks too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place; its got a great atmosphere and the menu is awesome. Last night was my first time coming here and the food and beer selection blew me away. The menu consists mostly of smaller, family-style portions that make it easy to share with a group. I started with the Wedges and Bleu salad which was excellent; not too light and not too filling. Afterwards we had the pretzel bread which takes ingredients from 3 of LV's local breweries. The cocktails are well crafted and the beer selection is very well curated. It's a wonderful addition to DTLV and I see myself coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The food here is okay .... our server Jamie was rude . Never have I ever been treated this way. I don't know if she was having a bad day to begin with , but don't take it out on your customers. I will not be back due to the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for any reason at all should be an excuse to have a meal here!  My brother in laws friend suggested we all go here.  We ordered 5 or six plates and passed everything around the table.  Every dish was outstanding!  Who knew lamb meatballs could change your entire life!!??  Bravo Chef!  Counting the days to my return."}
{"text":"BEST brunch!!! Food was so good, service was the best, and we had live music. Loved the vibe. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Food, alcohol and service amazing.  I wanted to eat everything!"}
{"text":"Five of us lucky to sit down on a Friday night tho it was Punk Rock Bowling weekend. Our special cocktails were exquisite, then came the appetizer, sort of a cauliflower felafel over a sesame hummous-- amazing. My dining mates loved their Caesar salad w squid ink dressing & eleplant sandwich. I ordered a side of mac n cheese with mushrooms, it was much bigger than a side and appropriately cheesed, instead of a gluey geyser. LOVED it & refused to share, I also got a fresh and sparkling Urban Seed Salad. Atomic is the perfect choice no matter which part of Vegas you want to dine in!"}
{"text":"Food is great, the soft pretzel was great. The ribeye was small but great. The desserts (we had both) are great. Justin Z was a superlative server.  This is a very historical bar in Las Vegas with a new restaurant that is worth visiting. On east Fremont."}
{"text":"I had been trying to get in here and eat for a few months and was pretty excited to finally walk in the door.  We were seated immediately and although it looked moderately busy, there were only a handful of employees working.  A server came over pretty quick at first and took a drink order but a while passed before he returned with the cocktails.  Cocktails were good but not worth the over 10 minute wait.  The food took a while to come out as well, including about 20 minutes for the oysters as appetizer.  Here's a breakdown of what we ordered.

Grilled oysters 5/5
Probably the best thing we ordered.  Great flavors, cool presentation 

Beef tartare 2/5
The flavors were bland and the portion size was huge.  The choice to serve them with fries didnt really work

Eggplant sandwich 2/5
When it arrived to the table the food runner says \"by the way we were out of eggplant so we made it with squash instead.\"  We probably would have ordered something else if we had been told that before.  The sandwich itself was ok.  Fries the highlight of the dish by far

Coriander carrots 1/5
The carrots came out rock hard (as in raw and uncooked). I'm not sure if they were supposed to be served like that but they were nearly inedible.  

Ny strip special 2/5
We ordered the steak special which was served with (suprise) fries again.  A little more menu variety, especially with the specials, wouldve been nice.  The steak comes out and it is a very medium well ( we ordered it medium rare).  As people that are in the industry, we even used the flashlight on a cell phone to check it in the light.  The server takes it back to the kitchen and then returns and says \"The chef says the steak was the medium rare temp 134 degrees but we will cook you another one\".  I'm not sure why try to argue with the guest when the temperature was obviously wrong.  The next steak came out about 15, 20 minutes later and was much closer to the medium rare temperature we requested.  The steak tasted ok, nothing too special."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good.  Loud.  Food: I had a Caesar salad, it was fresh, taste was clean.   The rib eye sandwich was good also.  The fries  though!!  Wow very good ( Waffle )"}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Food is sourced locally and sustainably, and was absolutely amazing! One of the best places in Vegas. Hands down."}
{"text":"Awesome service, uniquely good food- wicked fun atmosphere. It was a little too dark in there to snag any quality photos of food- but we enjoyed all of what we ordered. Went in on a Thursday evening- not a ton of people there so we got particular attention from our server. Only bummer is how many beers they were out of! It's a little pricy for bar food, so we'll tag it as more of a dinner outing than a place for apps and beers."}
{"text":"Holy shit. Where to begin? I've always loved Atomic and had an incredible experience at Atomic Kitchen when we first visited a little over a month ago, but they have since hired a new chef and changed the menu. Tonight we took some previous Vegas residents there and had the most awful food experience I've EVER had at a restaurant.  Both of the meals that were ordered were the worst I've ever seen. The pork was well over 50% fat with no side to offset the strange entree and the chicken was mediocre with a terribly bitter side that was no help to the protein for the meal.

After complaining about the terrible entrees we opted to replace them with a Cuban sandwich & fries, which were delivered incorrectly at first! After 15 minutes we got the corrected version which wasn't much better, it was overly greasy with a crazy amount of fat on the pork.

The redeeming factor of the meal should have been the incredible drinks Atomic typically offers, but those too were tainted by the new menu and were awful.

I look forward to when Atomic changes the menu and we have the opportunity to come back and try it."}
{"text":"this place was delicious. I considered giving 4 stars because the host staff was a bit rude, but once we were seated the rest was perfection. So, 5 stars it is. Justin was our server and he was kind, attentive, knowledgeable, and very good at his job. We had drinks, a cocktail and a beer...both enjoyed. We had the loaded fries and the wings. The pizza waffle at the bottom of the wings was heavenly, as was the airy blue cheese sauce. The prices were totally reasonable, and I look forward to coming back to try the main dishes. Job very well done!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here on the first night with the new chef and it is AMAZING!!!!! If you have the opportunity to eat here do it. In fact, bring a group of friends and settle in for the long haul. Try everything and drink everything else. TIP: bread pudding is me least favorite dessert on the planet...I will order bread pudding EVERY time I come here! That stuff is magical!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with: the food is fantastic, the drink menu is awesome, and the ambience is hip. I will most definitely be coming back. We came for brunch. 

The issue was that a large group of what looked like Elite Yelp members or something were catered to over us - for over an hour. They received drinks, food, anything they needed. They wandered around the patio taking random pictures of their food and cocktails. Meanwhile we ordered drinks and an hour later we still didn't have them. I myself had ordered a draft beer...not quite sure how that can't be served immediately. I even get a 10-15 minute wait, it was fairly busy after all. But an hour? I promise I'm not exaggerating. Once the group of food photographers left the service picked back up. I did feel bad for our server, it must've been a tough position for him to be in."}
{"text":"I went back to Atomic and enjoyed my meal once again.  However, the menu had a complete overhaul.  The shakshuka we tried last time no longer exists.  The steak I see so many pictures of nowhere to be seen.  Still, the burger and the ham with egg and toast hit the spot.  The burger was just a quality burger with some thick fries.  Definitely get some of th house sriracha for dipping.  The ham was an interesting dish for dinner and had a visually pleasing set up with a fried egg in the middle and ham, tomato, and toast surrounding.  Thick toast and smoky ham - perfect.  The menu was all over the place with bbq for the big meal, greens and salads for the healthy, and burgers and sandwiches for the in between.  

Onto the beer.  About 10 on draught and 9 of them rare for the area.  Tasters galore and perfect pours everytime.  Waiters are very knowledgeable about the beer and will help you out to get your optimal drink.  Waiter in all was just awesome.  He knew his food and drink specials down to a tee.  I will definitely be back as twice I was very content with my meal at the Kitchen at Atomic."}
{"text":"Stopped in here when I was having some drinks at Atomic Liquors next door. I had the Steak Tartare and the cauliflower curry balls. The Steak Tartare was absolutely amazing. Perfectly done with an egg on top. Honestly one of the best things Ive eaten in a long time. The curry balls were also great but the true star was the tartare. I HIGHLY recommend coming here for food. I will definitely be back for a full meal sometime.  The service was great and the food even better."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great bartender. Highly recommend a stop here if you're on Fremont. We had the shrimp mozzarella sticks (which sound super gross but are FANTASTIC) and the shaksuka. I also had an amazing whisky cocktail. Great ambiance, very nice staff, and all around a good stop. Also--affordable! Have a beer at the historic Atomic Liquors (oldest bar in Vegas) next door and then sidle on over here for fab food and cocktails. Go here. It's good."}
{"text":"You'll love it if you're hipster. The food is a little offbeat and quirky. I love the open space and high ceilings. It looks new and fresh as compared to Atomic itself, which is the oldest bar in Vegas. 

The waffles and frosty dish was ok. The pickle platter was a little too much for me with their hipster brines and fermentations. The pretzel appetizer was pretty good with its dipping sauce.

It all comes down to personal preference and I'd say it's a hit or miss. Willing to try something creative and hipster or safe but enjoyable? I'll probably back if I end at Atomic, but you'll probably catch me on the safe than sorry route.

P.S. their bathroom is really clean. The only thing I wonder is why they have a tv in both of their restrooms... So hipster."}
{"text":"This is an excellent addition to Atomic Liqueurs.  I stopped by to try a couple of cocktails and get some food after work.  The interior was contemporary and inviting and the two cocktails I had were well made and delicious.  They had a good selection of beers on tap and there was a good offering on the food menu.  I tried the Fat Man Fries and let me tell you that was a whole lot of food.  I couldn't even finish it all so took half of it home to enjoy later.  Service was decent and the food prices were alright.  Will I be back? Oh yeah."}
{"text":"We were in town for vacation last month (spent half our time near downtown and half on the strip). We stopped in Kitchen at Atomic before eventually heading to Fremont Street.

Perfect place for drinks and apps or a light meal. Our waiter was outstanding (maybe his name was Connor??). He helped us with the menu, drink recommendations, gave us a history lesson on Atomic Liquors, and some great tips for the area. We had a lot of little small plates but the shrimp mozzarella sticks were one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Perfect gourmet bar food. May need to fly to Vegas just to get some again...

Also had some kind of coffee flip drink that our waiter recommended that was perfect and the double ipa aged in Chardonnay barrels they had on special was dreamy. 

Go here. Go hungry. Go thirsty. And enjoy..."}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends for dinner, service was excellent. Great drink menu. Shared Benton's Ham, Mac & cheese and cauliflower hush puppies. All standouts! The bread pudding is a can't miss item."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here before going to a Movie and what A find. The service was flawless, out server, Jamie, was a delight. She made recommendations on beer and dinner and both were spot on.

They have a interesting beer selection that is fun, unique and different. I took Janine's recommendation for a lighter amber ahed in a rye barrel it was excellent. They encourage tasting and we tried a few.. 

I had the pastrami special and it was amazing. My wife had a simple burger and was pleased. The fries  were excellent, the ranch dressing was delicious. The food was excellent t!

The prices were reasonable. The place is a great place in the downtown area.

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Super stoked for the opening of the Kitchen at Atomic! After watching the building slowly come together over the past several months, it's cool (& convenient) to be able to hang out at one of my favorite bars AND be able to try some new, tasty food just steps away. The Kitchen shares a patio with the original Atomic, but also has its very own lengthy bar within, complete with a unique drink menu. With that being said, try the Imposter! It's a new favorite cocktail of mine, alongside the Atomic's good ol' Hunter S. Mash.

If you stop in at the Kitchen, you NEED to try the food. My friends and I have been here twice now already (lol, it's only been open for 4 days... oops?) and things just keep getting better & better. The menu has a good variety of things to choose from - including veggie options, meaning there's a little something for everyone! And each dish is so carefully & artfully put together. You can tell Josh Horton and his crew are really taking their time with the details.

So far, my favorite dish has to be the Ribeye Crown. It was sooo juicy and tender, being cooked just as I like it (a perfectly pink medium) and paired with delicious sautéed carrots & a \"smashed\" potato. Luckily, my friends and I are super into sharing, so we've all tried just about everything on the menu already: Scallops, spaghetti squash, \"Atomic\" chicken wings, macaroni bites, a soft pretzel w/ the fixings, Fat Man Fries, lemon-ricotta donuts w/ ice cream, etc... Seriously, almost EVERYTHING... and it's all AMAZING! I'm positive we'll be returning soon and often. We might even make this a weekend tradition. I know they're still in the opening stages and are still getting into the swing of things, but I hope they expand their menu and add more dishes! I really can't get enough!"}
{"text":"First off Chef Justin is amazing. Been a huge fan of his cooking since Slow Boy, I'm sure he was phenomenal before Slow boy but thats where I got to discover his food. 

Started dinner with the black Caesar salad made with squid ink and black garlic. Only thing I have to say about this is I'd like more of the perfect croutons. 

Literally mind blowing food. We ordered the tomahawk and it was cooked perfectly....so so buttery. We ordered the Maitake mushroom Mac n cheese and baby potatoes w/ aioli. 

Mac n cheese was extremely creamy and the pieces of mushroom were such a good addition. The potatoes had a great crisp to them and the aioli paired really well with it. If I was alone in the restaurant I would've licked the serving plate the Mac n cheese came in. 

Last but not least the bread pudding with cardamom cream. Such a great combo! 

I know I didn't describe the dishes in detail but you really just need to go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I had the burger with waffle fries and it was delicious! Great food, great beer, and great service."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. My favorites are their wedge salad and the steak tartare. They make this smokey bleu cheese mousse for their chicken wings that is to die for. I'm super glad that Atomic Liquors has a business close by now!

Next step: brunch? Please please!"}
{"text":"Their pate plate was huge and delicious! We Also had the steak tartare w/ saffron garlic aoli, served with fries, and the Black Ceaser salad. It's so weird but insanely addicting! I highly recommend their cocktail \"Church\"-- OMG, it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Really excited to return to try their late night menu. What made the experience even better was our server Connor. He answered all my questions and explained everything really well. It's been a while since I've had a server who cared."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service.  Outside seating.   Baked oysters,  spicy chicken hearts,  West Coast Sole."}
{"text":"There's so many places that have a fantastic appetizer/small bites list that their entrees (given either their price point or their taste), don't quite live up to the expectations set by the prior courses. I think that The Kitchen at Atomic suffers from that as well. 

Our dinner group tried a number of snacks including the country pate & toast, foie gras slider, and the tri-tip beef tartare farm egg & wedge fries. Of the tree, I loved that foie gras slider. It was $19, but damn, that was one of the best pieces of seared foie gras I've had in a long time. It came with an assortment of pickled plums and granola, which was an interesting, but delicious platter. The country pate & toast was a great platter to share and the staff quickly came by with more slices of grilled toast. I believe the spread came with both a pâté mousse and a terrine, both of which went delightfully with the grilled toast. There was also a number of pickled vegetables, and mustard, all of which went quite well together. My least favorite was actually the beef tartare and egg, which I didn't really get too much of the flavor I was seeking. 

For sides, do get the maitake mushroom mac & cheese. It's a delight if you're a fungus lover like I am. Of the bowls, I also liked the ballerina pasta. Shallots, garlic, and squid ink really go well together. 

As for the entrees, many people at the table commented on how salty everything was. I had a taste of everything including the pork belly steak and the pasture bird cooked two ways, and I do have to agree on the salt. I ended up getting the central coast tri-tip, which had a large generous serving of tri-tip, but I found the meat to be very rubbery and chewy. My favorite was probably the chicken, both the white and dark meat. You could really taste the garlic grits with the white meat and the wine with the dark. 

While up to that point the meal had its highs and lows, we didn't expect dessert to steal the show. The whiskey bread pudding was a showstopper. It was an amazing treat. The bread was perfectly crisp on the edges and topped with cardamom whipped cream with smoked sea salt caramel. This should be a must-try for any diner here."}
{"text":"So happy this place is open! Great local neighborhood spot! Food is delicious and love the vibe."}
{"text":"What a great evening of food and drink! The chicken hearts are absolutely a must get that for anyone who goes here! It is great to see downtown Las Vegas buzzing like it was last night at this local eatery! Leave the corporate monsters on the strip and come down and have some soulful food and drink done by a phenomenal chef Justin Kingsley hall!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because it was Thursday night, or the Stanley Cup was ending and out wonderful Golden Knights were on the way to their final defeat, but the food was TERRIBLE. The service was fair but argumentative and not only were we not asked if we wanted desert ( no way after what we had already experienced) but we waited 8 to 10 minutes after we clearly were not eating and finally flagged down a waitress to ask for the check. Four or five minutes later the original waiter brought it.
The Roasted Olives, Tomatoes, and Peppers was a wet mix of olives with straggled pieces of tomato and a bunch of tiny little pickled peppers with no taste or heat. Nothing had been roasted, maybe it was boiled.
The blackened Romaine salad had been on a grill but only long enough to give it a meat smoke taste, no grill marks and i think it was already wilted before it saw the grill. The only thing black was the overdone squid ink dressing.
The foie gras slider was not bad but it was served with a strawberry garnish that was a large, very pale thawed out frozen strawberry, that was mush.
The Tri-tip sandwich had over done cut up small chunks of meat with gristle and fat. Three quarters of it went home to the dogs.
The pork sandwich was basically inedible. A mixture of pork, overcooked to the point some was too hard to chew, smashed in a brioche, with something else not tasting good. Only the Labrador was allowed to have
this one.
 We did like the building, ambience, and libations, but found it strange that the waiter talked down the Atomic Liquors Bar and the people that frequent it."}
{"text":"Bomb burger! Definitely coming back for it! One of the best burger spots in Vegas! Everything is good here, I'd recommend the burger, curry oysters, and bone marrow for sure! More hungry- try the appetizer carrots, steak tartare, or foie gras! The steak tartare comes with steak fries and is a generous portion of steak."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight at the kitchen by Atomic. Justin the chef and Justin the server made our night. From the beginning to the end service and food were excellent. The marrocan harrissa carrots , yum! not to spicy and just the perfect amount to let you enjoy the carrots. The pottatoes were excellent and perfectly cooked. The vegan Pie made my day. Coctail of the day had a lot of flavor by himself. About Justin the server, great knowledge about the menu. Describe every dish with no hesitation and put so much enthusiasm,  you feel like you want to eat everything. The kitchen at Atomic is a must go."}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday night at 8 PM without reservations with the Fiery BBFF.  We were extra bored, hungry and found ourselves at the recently opened Kitchen at Atomic looking to smash our boredom.

Service: 4.5/5 The hostess was great. She asked how the night was going and if we wanted a table inside or outside as the weather was lovely. Our awesome waiter Justin Z. was very attentive to us from beginning to end.  After discovering this was our first visit, he mentioned that the restaurant use to be a Garage and was featured in the movie \"Casino\" He was helpful with telling the how the servings worked with the the mac n cheese bites we were eyeing (5 pieces)  He checked on us frequently and kept our Tito's and gingers coming.  Shout out to the waiter who we mistook for Justin after our 3rd Tito's.  He had the same stylish haircut and beard, friendly attitude but was wearing glasses.  He took our order for the 4th Tito's without hesitating as if he was assigned to our table himself.  Fantastic...lol

Food: 4.0/5.0 On our quest to Atom smash our hunger, we were either going with stacking up a burger with their awesome additions (see pics) or going with a more traditional dish in the \"main\" section.  I stacked up a burger with horseradish cheddar + sriracha bacon and of course a fried egg.  All additions were so tasty and the fried egg was cooked perfect to the point where not too much yolk flies out after the first bite.  Very impressed, with this tasty burger.  Waffle fries were the perfect compliment. The Mama Johns Mac Bites were tasty , but only came out in 5 small pieces.  3 more small pieces to get to 8 would be perfect.

Value:4.0/5.0 Our burgers started at $9 and each addition is either a $1 or $2..  The high quality additions were fantastic. (see pic) They had 7 different cheeses to pick from & if you've been following me you know that cheese = bae.  Our Tito's and gingers were $7 and mixed well.

Ambiance: 5.0/5.0 The courtyard outside has long tables to accommodate large parties. (10+) and there's plenty of seating inside the \"Garage\" with additional outdoor seating on the side.  The vibe and energy is great.  Great contemporary industrial feel in the garage with still some old school Vegas flavor and history.  The Atomic Bar, is a stumble next door and is perfect place to park for more drinks after dinner.

Summary:  We came in hangry and bored, and left full and recharged for a Saturday night downtown because of the great food, excellent service and vibe.  I look forward to heading back and either trying something off the main side, or stacking another burger with excellent cheese combos.  Afterwards we headed over to the historic Atomic bar that's connected to the kitchen, but that's another yelp tale. =)"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with friends. The appetizers where outstanding, in particular the Harissa carrots. I also had the short rib, a rather large cut. Very tender and tasty. The beer selection was great, we had a bourbon stout."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese bites were good! The beef tartare was dry. The scallops were perfectly cooked-but extremely salty. I believe that they have all the skills to have a good food program, with a few more months I think they will be able to refine all the details."}
{"text":"Forgot to take a picture but the fried chicken here is amazing!!!!!!  Came for it 2 nights in a row!  Perfect breading, chicken is so tender and modify barbecue sauce is to die for!!!  Love love love love!!!!!"}
{"text":"I fully expected to love this place, as adjacent bar Atomic Liquors is a longtime favorite, and the Kitchen came highly recommended by friends. But I couldn't get behind it.

I mean no offense or disrespect -- service was great, and they seem like super nice people. The atmo was fine, except for the fact that, if you order food, you can't sit on the regular street-facing Atomic patio and people-watch the bums and weirdos -- you have to sit in a little walled-in inner courtyard, with nothing to watch but your fellow hipsters.

But the menu is what really got me down. The drink menu was confusing and just TOO weird, even for me -- and I'm someone who drinks some fucked-up shit! It was all anise cream and Scotch and flowers and shit, like one of those gradeschool cafeteria challenges where your friend mixes up every disgusting mis-matched condiment and liquid and dares you to drink it. WTF happened to regular-ass drinks?! Does every fuckin' drink have to have artisanal whale piss and a fox-endometrium floater to be served in polite society these days?!

The food menu was heavy on the burgers and hotdogs, but not the pedestrian ones you used to be able to buy off the cart outside the bar -- this shit is deconstructed af, and you pay twice as much for the privilege. The rest of the fairly slim menu was all over the place -- duck bacon, a frosty, scallops, shredded spaghetti squash with eggs and ratatouille al over it. Again, I like some WEIRD ASS FOOD, but this menu was really hard for me to wrap my head around -- there was no theme or unifying concept, just a bunch of weird-ass shit paired up with hot dogs, bacon and burgers. 

My sister and I had the two least-offensive sounding cocktails on the menu, which were pretty good, fairly strong and around $10 apiece. Mine also had some kind of seasonal flowers muddled up at the bottom of it, if stuff like that matters to you.

Then we shared the lobster mac and cheese bites, which were fine, and she had the veggie burger (which she said was kinda dry and not that flavorful) and I had the aforementioned spaghetti squash with eggs and some kind of tomato sauce on it. It tasted about how it sounds -- I'd call it hot'n'soggy. (I ordered it because I didn't want a burger, and nothing else really looked good....I mean, I have *never* had such a confusing time with a menu. I EAT EVERYTHING!).

Another friend joined us and had the frosty and waffle fries -- a desert item comprised of a small chocolate frosty with a side of waffle fries, which I guess are meant to be dipped in the frosty. The waiter recommended he add a side of duck bacon, which supposedly somehow adds to the party. My friend ate it all, but seemed underwhelmed/unimpressed.

Overall, I just felt like this place was trying too hard to be weird (or progressive/edgy/nouveau/whatever you'd call it). I see the other reviews are almost all raves, and I feel like a backwoods rube for not \"getting it....\" but I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Came here on a Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed the ambiance, food, and dranks. 
The Kitchen at Atomic is actually located next door to Atomic Liquors, not inside as i anticipated. It carried more of a restaurant feel, rather than a bar. It does have a fabulous bar area though, if you're not interested in sitting at a table. The contemporary decor fits in nicely with the space.
The food menu is simple, yet every dish seems to have a twist. The mister ordered a 4th of July burger with waffle fries. And I opted out for apps, wings with a pizza waffle and mac n cheese bites. We also shared the soft pretzel. Everything was spectacular, except one... 
I was not feeling the mac bites. They came out kind of dry, with no signs of lobster. I took half the order to go and threw it out when I got home, realizing I was not going to eat them.
The soft pretzel was the first thing we tried and were immediately impressed. It was a ridiculous good pretzel! I loved the smoked beer cheese as well and ended up dipping my pizza waffle in it as well. It's like it can be part of a commercial, \"Smoked beer cheese, I put that B%!$h on everything\"... The pizza waffle and wings were impressive too. The waffle had a pronounced pepperoni flavor making it perfectly savory. I took half of this app home as well, and actually finished it soon after :) 
My honey enjoyed his burger, it was topped off with bacon, hot dog, and beer cheese and a side of waffle fries. He offered for me to try it but it looked like a freaking tower in his plate, I did not know how to even attempt!
I typically like to have an adult beverage with my food. I opted out for the Impostor, why? tequila, that's why! It was a light, yet potent. A few rounds got me pleasantly tipsy.
Our server was wonderful, he gave us a little history on the establishment and was very attentive. 
This spot is a nice addition to the Vegas bar/restaurant scene. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this new set up! I've been to atomic liquors many times and have always thought they should have food. The kitchen is not connected but has a patio and I love the vibe. It looks like a warehouse but when you step inside it is decorated very chicly. They have a full bar with a great beer/wine and crafted cocktail selection. The hostesses weren't very welcoming and were talking amongst each other and didn't even greet us until I said hello and then acted as if it was a chore to seat us. Luckily our server made up for it by being very friendly and making suggestions as we had never been there. we ordered the steak tartare, scallops and ribeye which was good/decent. They're not overpriced at all either, but the portions seemed small for main dishes. I really liked the Caesar salad which had real pieces of anchovy and corn which was unique but it worked."}
{"text":"best food service in Las Vegas hands down. Being Vegan, it is really hard to go out to eat. The Chef and staff were incredible. So polite, attentive accommodating the chef even came out and asked how it was. It was delicious, they are going to add Vegan options to the menu, I look forward to that. I am also certain that EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious, before becoming Vegan I use to eat there all the time. but most importantly this is the first time I've experienced staff that didn't get upset about my dietary restriction.. Having health problems, is hard and it is easy to blow people off for it. My favorite bar, and now my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Thankyou for the amazing customer service. I truly appreciate it."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch. We were completely ignored for some elite yelpers. It took us over an hour to get our first drinks and longer than that for our food. Some of our group just had beers, this place is attached to a huge bar! After talking to our waiter several times, the manager and the head chef we finally were able to get all of our ordered items. Almost all of our modifications were not done. They had a band out on the patio but it was clearly hired just for the group of yelpers as they left right after they finished dining. I felt like I wasn't even a real customer. I will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"The photos speak for themselves. Service was 5 Star!!! We won't miss this place ever again and will remain a MUST stop for our trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was in your restaurant last week for a business conference and had to get off the strip.  We had an incredible time, food, drinks, and atmosphere!  Our server (Jamie with a \"J\", we added the \"with a J\") was fantastic fun!

We ordered practically everything on your menu but I was blown away by the KJ Prime Rib Dip. The au jus was DRINKABLE!

Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"First time going here and the food was Delightful. My boyfriend ordered the Hamburger ($9) with an add-on of a fried egg (additional $) and side of fries and I ordered the KJ Prime Rib Dip ($12) with a side of waffle fries. The prices were reasonable, but you pay $2 extra for fries, waffle fries or a salad with your sandwich. For the size of the KJ Prime Rib Dip, which was a good size for a person who wanted something not to big or heavy for lunch, it should've came with fries. Nonetheless, it was delicious apart from that concern of ours. I also ordered the 'nuts for chocolate' beer that was nice. The service was good and the server told us the history of the restaurant, which was insightful. The seating of the hostess could've gone faster as I saw a lot of open tables. We waited for the 2nd hostess to sit us, which I thought was strange since the place inside isn't that big where I'd get lost."}
{"text":"This place stands out for a few reasons. Of course you'd expect the food to be tasty. The menu holds up and is varied enough to please many! I've been here a couple of times and the service has been exceptional. Truly kind and wonderful people. Finally, the vibe is great. It's modern but somehow it has a real vintage-Vegas feel. It's classic Vegas re-mastered. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Since this place opened I had been looking forward to checking it out. I came in on a Saturday night for a friends bday. We were seated quickly and our server was friendly and attentive for the most part.

The food is where my main disappointment came from. To start there weren't too many vegetarian options to chose from which kind of surprised me considering it's downtown. The menu was very small and limited in general. Either way I decided to order the vegetarian pot pie. When it came out it looked beautiful, but the flavor was so bland and boring. I think the best thing in the dish was the tomatoes.  

Also back to the service part - our food all came out at different times which I get for a group is somewhat normal, but the last two meals didn't come out until way later after everyone else was already finished with their meals. For the restaurant only being about 1/3 full I thought that was pretty off.

I'm not sure I'd ever come back here again. I think I'll just stick to the bar side from now on."}
{"text":"The service was great, Jamie our server was so sweet and attentive.
The food however was not so great. 
I ordered the Caesar salad- which the menu states it consisted of romaine, cactus, hominy and anchovy. An interesting interpretation I thought. It was a confused salad. The cactus( nopales) was cut too big and not seasoned appropriately. The hominy was nothing but cornuts!!!!! I almost laughed out loud. I think they tried so hard to mix this one up and it failed they did not mesh well together.
My boyfriend ordered the hot dog appetizer  trio. All three of the hot dogs were broiled (ew) and had no flavor. One of the hot dogs
was a chili dog and the chili on top was dried out!!! How long was that sitting there for? 
The only food I liked was the wings served atop a pepperoni pizza waffle. The wings were a tad too mushy for my liking but the dish was actually good. If I ever came back I would stick to this."}
{"text":"The newest hidden secret. The expansion of vegas most hidden gem. Amazing food. Great drinks. Wine list that shouldn't be overlooked. Beers you've never seen on other menus. Diver scallops that are out of this world. Staff that are professional, friendly and funny. Can't miss stop for any local or tourist."}
{"text":"The food here was okay, not the greatest. I ordered hot wings with a side of fries. The service was terrible. Our server's name is Jamie. She was very rude. We did nothing to upset her so I'm not sure why she acted that way. She took our orders with attitude. She made it obvious that she was mad and annoyed every time she talked to us. I will not go back due to the service. If she is going to be like that at work, then why work there?"}
{"text":"The Kitchen at Atomic is a must when on Fremont. Amazing staff, delicious food, great handcrafted cocktails, and unique local drafts. I will definitely be stopping in for a sip and bite whenever I'm on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"i really like the setting,but I was hoping for a little more flavour in the trash fries and Mac bites we ordered. both were a little monotone and the fries were a very heavy dish. definitely  not what we needed on a hot vegas evening."}
{"text":"Okay I stopped into Atomic on Sunday after watching football to downtown Event Center and had an absolutely incredible flavor explosion in my mouth with a new Chef Justin over here at the Kitchen at Atomic.  It was absolutely incredible meal. Started off with the Kingsley fried wing and the those potatoes would you absolutely incredible with a Pat and marble Black Plum cobbler with lavender honey ice cream for dessert, which was absolutely outstanding it was top with along the whole medley of crust pistachios candied in the honey and then Justin surprise me again with Incredible dessert made of roasted squash chocolate mexican chili gelato. Jutin the New Chef is incredibly talented and focused on bringing a new experience in Downtown. Well Done!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice spot in all its newish-ness. Overall I was impressed by the service, food, and ambience. 

Very fresh for downtown with a cool and clean vibe. The place was comfortable. 

We had three appetizers: steak tartare, pretzel bun, and Mac bites. Out of the three the pretzel was the winner. The tartare was good. But maybe needed a little more salt and maybe some acid. The texture was great, tho. The Mac bites were fine, but nothing to write home about. 

The entrees were all on point. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I had the u10 scallops which were seared perfectly, med/rare, and succulent and sweet. Most places over cook scallops. These were amazing. We also had the halibut special which was super fresh and served with some briny sea beans. It was executed well. 

Overall beer selection was unique, but I found some of the selections to be pricier than I would like. 

Go check the place out. You'll like it"}
{"text":"Here I was geared up for the intergalactic art car festival at the Llama Lot, peacock feathers in my hair, a reusable water bottle at my hip, and a stomach growling like an engine. Time to eat! And how convenient that Atomic Liquors was right across the street. I'd only been to the bar before and hadn't tried the food yet. I'm so glad I fixed that!

Food. Was. Delicious. It may be a dive bar on one side, but the other side is gourmet. I tried the harissa carrots with coriander cream and they were perfect. In fact, my favorite dish of the night. (I kept dipping my fries in the cream). Also, I ordered the central coast tri-tip which was flavorful although a bit bleu for my taste. I ended the meal with dessert - the whiskey bread pudding with caramel sauce and cardamom whipped cream. 

Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We had the mac and cheese for appitizer. There wasnt a whole lot of flavor but decent. The entree I had the cheeseburger which was really tasty. And the dessert was the doughnuts which were amazing. Overall great place to go check out."}
{"text":"Love this place, the Cuban was amazing and the pulled pork special transported us to heaven.  Their eclectic food and drink menu plus the great atmosphere and then our waitress rocked go Mandee!!  It's worth the long walk down Fremont street."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes please!!! We truly enjoyed our experience dining at the Kitchen. The service was spot on, so knowledgeable and friendly. My mom was early so she waited for us at the bar and got to talking with the chef and learned about the food on the menu, let's just say she is in love.... The 4 of us shared the cauliflower hush puppies, the bourbon butter oysters, a fresh green salad with roasted turnips and pepitas.... then we had the chicken 2ways, pan seared trout with potatoes and the Mac n cheese with mitaki mushrooms (sorry about my spelling...) the guys also enjoyed some craft draft beer and we had wine of course!!! Obviously we didn't hold back!  We can't wait to go back for everything else on the menu. The food was all made with thoughtful creativity. They also have sandwiches on the menu. There is an amazing patio in the front where you can have drinks and you go inside to eat. A really nice renovation of this ol landmark."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Carrots are awesome. Ask for Justin...he is a wealth of knowledge on drinks and food. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and staff were great! Loved learning about the history from the friendly bartender. Had the Chicken Thighs which were excellent."}
{"text":"Not at all what you expect for a food venue attached to a dive bar (a solid dive bar, mind you, but a dive bar nevertheless).

Hard to imagine, but root vegetables were the star of the show. The harissa carrots, and the roasted yukon gold potatoes were amazing. 

I guess it should not be so surprising considering how good french fries are when out drinking, but those dishes really satisfied.

We had the special of oysters in a curry sauce. I prefer oysters raw, but I think this dish worked. The prep preserved the texture of the oyster, and the sauce added spice to the natural briny flavor. Might not be in the mood for this all the time. Just goes to show what the chef is capable of."}
{"text":"HUH???

Anyone who knows the Vegas bar scene knows the Atomic, the oldest and most iconic dive bar in the Fremont badlands with a solid selection of craft beers and bourbon.  

So what gives?  They convert the neighboring mechanics shop to a separate, freestanding restaurant, The Kitchen at the Atomic that has nothing to do with the original Atomic Liquors.  Some millennial urbanites idea of a bar; polished concrete, glass, pompous mixed drinks and trendy food (you know, truffle this, foie that, brioche, miso, yuzu, demi).

Ignoring my disgust, the food is OK by Vegas' very high standards.  Lulu's soft pretzel, a warm, chewy pretzel roll with beer mustard (whole grain mustard) and spicy beer cheese (oh yeah), not traditional but satisfying.  Mama Johns Mac Bites aren't as successful.  Basically lobster mac & cheese balls atop an excessive amount of gruyere béchamel.  Extremely rich and creamy but the flavor of the lobster is lost.

The burger, thick, free formed patty, well seasoned, cooked to temp, A-OK.  The addition of thick cut siracha bacon and pickled jalapeños and a fried egg (toppings sold separately, $1 - $2 each) made it sing though a regular bun would have been preferred to the brioche that rapidly got soaked with the burgers juices.

Finally the rib eye crown.  This is the best deal in the place.  A grilled rib cap for $15.  Tender and fatty in all the right ways.  Aggressively seasoned. Roasted carrots a nice touch.  Great dish to share.

Very friendly local service.  Inexpensive food prices.

Think of it as another bar hop stop (i.e. drink at the Atomic, soak it up here and move on)."}
{"text":"The Kitchen @ Atomic sits a couple blocks East of the Fremont Street Experience. Venture past the chaos into a welcoming restaurant and bar on Fremont / 10th street, serving food that's quite ambitious as it is delicious :)

Not one to pass up Foie Gras on the menu, you'll fare well with the Foie Gras Toast : Toasted Bread, Fruit Compote, Roasted Seeds & Nuts. Excellent Foie Gras, pairing well with the sweets and seeds...recommended!

Also try the MMM : Mocha Oatmeal Stout Mole, Beef Cheek, Seasonal Pickles, Brown Butter Masa Dumplings. Nice Mole, fair amount of heat with chunks of tender beef. Dumplings more like a cornbread in consistency and taste. Recommended!

And don't miss the Boneless Hot Pig in Winter : Crispy Pork in Afghan Stew, Peppers, Garlic, Greens, Cilantro & Onions. Tender, delicious pork with a thin, crispy skin. Very elaborate dish that works well :)

For dessert, you'll be hard pressed to find a better bread pudding...if this raises a brow, give the Whiskey Bread Pudding a whirl : Griddled Whiskey Bread Pudding, Smoked Sea Salt Caramel & Cardamom Whipped Cream, Outstanding bread pudding, great consistency and sweetness, subtle whisky flavor with a hint of salt.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to try Atomic kitchen for the first time and it was absolutely amazing! The food and service was fantastic! I love that the restaurant is open to the outside, great for summer. Our waiter (I think his name was Justin) was so fantastic and took his time to explain every little detail about the dish when we had questions, from the start of ordering to when we actually received it. I had the Mac Bites and Scallops which were phenomenal! The fat fries were delicious as well! Towards the end we got the lemon donuts and that was one of the best desserts I've ever had! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Bravo! This place brings it. Congrats Rose and Joshua on a really fantastic restaurant with such a great vibe. I've been four times in the past couple weeks and every time the food has been incredible. Brittany is such a great server (she's waited on us each time), the soundtrack is always great, the drinks are delicious. I wake up craving Atomic wings. YES! YES! YES!"}
{"text":"When Justin Kingsley Hall took over The Kitchen at Atomic it was almost certain that Downtown Las Vegas was about to receive another great Restaurant and having already been impressed by Dinner service it was together with three others that Brunch was sat down to on Saturday, Chef Hall's various former homes inspiring a menu that lacks for neither quality nor creativity.

Opening the garage door looking onto East Fremont widely, Las Vegas' early-Spring as well suited for al fresco enjoyment as Sin City always is for day drinking, it was seated in a rounded leather booth that guests were greeted by a server named Cameron, the menu as yet difficult to find online tempting with sections labeled Small Plates, Sides, Entrees and Seafood Shenanigans.

Restricted to folks 21-and-older, an understandable limitation not uncommon in Sin City, it was as the likes of Led Zeppelin played at low volume from speakers overhead that Brunch began with a slow roll-out of plates, the first of two $4 orders of Fries crisp and delicious whether with Ketchup or aromatic Saffron Aioli alongside deboned Smoked Trout and Vegetarian Hash that offer plenty of temptation themselves, the former simply allowing excellent Fish to shine while diced Spuds enlivened by Peas and Citrus provide an inspired alternative for those who've had enough of Avocado Toast. 

Nowhere near as busy by day as in the evening, a combination of factors including Atomic Liquor's storied history as a late-night favorite likely at play, it is on the Menu's backside that diners will find a handful of Cocktails created to compliment the full Bar and whether one opts for a Mimosa, Bloody or the Cold Brew-based \"Not Your Average Joe\" they can rest assure that the price is right as ingredients are as carefully selected as those that make up the Cuisine.

Smartly making familiar plates his own without abandoning the original concepts, Hall's side of \"Bacon\" in reality thick slices of Pork Belly cured on-site with Coffee and Orange, those seeking a dish that truly stands out would be well advised to request at least one order of \"Beefy Monkey Bread\" featuring three caramelized Rolls presented sticky beneath Bresaola, though the meatless contingent is certainly not forgotten whether one selects the daily Urban Seed Salad, fragrant Baby Potatoes or Atomic's take on Shakshuka that adds Chickpeas for texture amidst spicy Tomato Sauce and poached Eggs.

Allowing plenty of time to linger over Coffee and conversation, the large space and high ceilings offering a far less frenetic feel than eat or Carson Kitchen, those with more robust appetites will be pleased to know The Kitchen at Atomic does not hold back when it comes to plates labeled as Entrees, the Burrito named after a Street in Hall's hometown of San Luis Obispo easily enough to feed  two from its assortment of Eggs, Cheese, Potatoes and Beef while Chicken Fried Steak reportedly dedicated to Other Mama's Dan Krohmer sees 10oz of Grass-fed Beef  from Tasmania flattened and exquisitely tender alongside two Farm Eggs and Toast for just $21.

Never one to pass on Grits, the Southern staple here whipped thick with Cream and Garlic, those looking to end things on a high note will be happy to learn that the SLO-boy's famous Whiskey Bread Pudding also makes an appearance at Brunch, here ditching the Cardamom and skillet in favor of a French Toast preparation completed by Barrel aged Maple Syrup and lightly sweetened Cream. 

FIVE STARS:  Well-culled but offering plenty of options to suit a variety of appetites The Kitchen at Atomic immediately becomes the weekend's best reason to be in DTLV for Brunch unless one is below the legal drinking limit."}
{"text":"The place is cool looking. I had a cheeseburger w duck bacon and a fried egg. Also had the Mac n cheese bites. I was not impressed by anything I had. Pretty sad about it because it looked pretty good on Yelp. Hoping I go again and somehow love it. I'll def try something else out next time."}
{"text":"The new menu is fun on your own and even better with a group so you can share and try so much more.  There are great options for vegetarians and meat lovers and I think the biggest surprise was the blackened Cesar salad, delicious!!!  The photo is of the Kingsley's Fried Wing...that sauce though, wow!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to eat at the atomic kitchen for weeks now & it was definitely worth the wait , the food & service were excellent , the restaurant has a cool vibe , too bad it's a little further down Fremont for tourists . We def will be retuning often. Not your average bar food & will recommend it to all  our friends"}
{"text":"Saw that this place finally opened after anticipating it and I can say it sort of lived up to expectations. There are a lot of unique and interesting options that sets itself apart from the other restaurants in downtown but keeps it familiar at the same time.

We ordered:

Steak Tartare - Don't know if it was supposed to be this way but normally the steak tartare is usually wet and mushy with the egg yolk mixed it but this seemed to be a little bit more drier a crumbly. Different but def not the worst I've had

Fat Man Fries - shiiit this is basically an entree itself. If you ordered this with a burger your fucked cause you gonna be full. Similar to ordering Oxtail Chili Cheese fries and a burger at Bachi....everything you want in here, chili, hot dogs, bacon...even though the hot dogs can be better....but for the  

Chicken Wings - Wings were ehhh but the staple to this dish is the pizza waffle...shit is pure genius and has potential if paired up differently like a chicken parm and waffle type situation.

Hamburger - reminds me of the burger i had at Andres so you know its in proper quality


Overall very excited and anticipating what they do in the future. Most def an excellent addition to DTLV"}
{"text":"Hands down best NEW restaurant downtown. Everything we had was quality, delicious, and cheap. I went with five people and we all got a variety of menu items which we absolutely loved. Everything from wings to steak tartare, wings with pepperoni waffle (a pleasant surprise beneath the wings), lemon ricotta donuts, and a bottle of red blend for 18 dolla!

An urban twist on traditional bar food - but with a traditional bar food price. 

Justin, our gallant bearded server, was extremely knowledgeable and attentive in all matters regarding the menu. Knew the wine list and cocktails like the back of his hand.

PS bitchin soundtrack."}
{"text":"Checked out Atomic Liquors next door and wanted a late night snack. 

Love the vibe in here!

We shared the Cigar City (cuban sandwich) with fries.  Oh dear lord, it was the best cuban I've ever had!!

The roll was pressed and buttery. The shredded pork was definitely slow roasted, tender and juicy. The right amount of fat for flavor. Yum! Tons of cheese! Homemade pickles, mustard. So good! The fries were perfectly crispy and hot. 

I would love to try more food."}
{"text":"This is swiftly becoming my go-to bar downtown and here is why:
The place always has a good crowd and vibe
The drinks are creative and they have a very deep variety of alcohol. 
The small but we'll executed menu is fantastic!
The bartenders are proud of their drink creations and will engage in a discussion of them.
Prices are upscale but not outrageous.
My favorite menu item is the decadent shrimp cheese sticks. About an inch around it is a combination that works surprisingly well.  Their hamburger is one of the best in the city and you choose what goes on it from a list of toppings. 
Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Old Vegas meets New Vegas.  I'm a fan and not a hipster...big fan of the Fat Man Fries...chili, hot dogs, bacon, onions, peppers...topped tableside with adobo cheddar sauce from a small skillet..."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place before so me and my date decide to take a stop here all the way from LA.

However, we walked in directly friendly staff with a big smile on their place 5 of 5 directly.

The food and drinks was good but the best part is the staff is super friendly specially Jamie she is amazing server and funny everything was quick from the appetizer we had.

AppetizerCorn dog on stick, hot dog with some topping don't remember.

Dishes: Burger delicious

Dessert: Donuts with blueberry ( My dates favorite) It was so good but to bad I was too full to finish it. 
My date finished it and he is a geek when that's comes to donuts.

All in all good food and the staff was amazing defiantly coming back here next time I'm coming to LV.

Don't ever have a second thoughts just go and try it ask for Jamie as your server she is the best"}
{"text":"My first time coming in here and I will definitely be back. My best friend and I checked it out and it's definitely worth coming in for some drinks and good flavored food. The highlight of our night was Jami or food server. She was very sweet really friendly and definitely recommended some really good items. Once you're doneWith dinner go over next-door to atomic liquors and have some cocktails out on the patio. You won't be disappointed. Both places have huge selections of beers. You will definitely find something that you are going to like and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love the wings here. Service was good. Wish they could have came to our table faster so we can get our drink on. Over all the food is great, service is good."}
{"text":"The food had uniquely delicious flavors. Our server, Brittany , was personable and knowledgeable. I had a special request and it was met with a smile. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a later dinner at the bar.

After cocktails at Atomic Liquors, dinner at The Kitchen seemed like a logical choice. Weeknights seem to be pretty mellow in the dining room so we sat at the bar. The bartender made me some sort of mezcal cocktail to keep the night going. It was delicious. Smoky, yet refreshing. 

I loved the burger. We split it and got the onions and cheese on the side because my friend can't have dairy and doesn't like onions. I know, I know. I don't know why we are friends either. All that aside, the burger was delicious and juicy. The bun was soft and didn't fall apart. The fries were thick cut. Loved. 

I got the chance to chat up Chef Kingsley and I love his passion for the menu too. He has some cool plans for dessert that I can't wait to experience. We skipped the bread pudding this time but next time it's going down."}
{"text":"Great food. But flat out bad service.. had to ask for refills twice than finally after flagging someone down they came and got it. Server didn't seem too happy to be there who knows maybe he had a bad day but still you should leave that at home bud"}
{"text":"With a new chef in the kitchen and new menu rollout I could not resist returning to The Kitchen at Atomic to check out all the updates. I was in love with this spot before but now it's out of this world. The menu is creative and every dish we tried was excellent. Paired along with their excellent cocktail menu, this place is definitely better than ever. It's a spot I'll frequent whenever I'm in the downtown area."}
