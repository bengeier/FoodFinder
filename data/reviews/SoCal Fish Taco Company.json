{"text":"Zero complaints except maybe that I wish the place itself was larger! The atmosphere is spot on, it has the feel of beach taco shop for sure. The outdoor seating area is awesome, super fun place to kick back with friends! The tacos were sooooo good and prices were reasonable! Crab fries were yummy!!! The owner was super cool and making his rounds, service was spot on. I will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"This taco shop is delicious! We go as often as possible. 

The only issue was how slow the service can be at times. Other than that, Tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh fish! Just moved from Chicago and have never had such fresh seafood.
Great margaritas also.
Staff is super friendly and fun!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a while and so glad I finally did. The service was excellent, the food was excellent, and the menu is fairly priced. I ordered a Thresher Shark Taco, Lobster Taco and a shrimp taco with mussels to start SOOO Good!"}
{"text":"love so cal a cheery beachie feel been. comming here sinced it opened fab fish tacs ! sides and sauce a must love the. ice cream cookie !"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Better, cheaper, and less pretentious than Joy Ride which is down the street. I was expecting to order at a counter like Rubios, but this is a sit-down restaurant. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live close to downtown Gilbert and frequent here often. I have always enjoyed the food and the service ranges between adequate and excellent. I love the outdoor seating in the back during the winter where I can sit out there all night sipping on mini Corona beers and enjoying their lobster taco and amazing crab cakes. The baja sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant and it was a mistake. Their service was terrible, (filled my own drink) they forgot half our order, food is mediocre compared to a competing taco restaurant down the street, and they didn't check on us once after they gave us the food. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice small place that is very welcoming. The customer service is outstanding, and the tacos are some of the best I've had. The blackened grouper is my favorite.  Stop by and try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The chicken tortilla soup was excellent...big pieces of rotisserie chicken and a light, flavorful broth. The shrimp Caesar salad was good but boring. Fresh and crisp romaine with perfectly cooked shrimp, but there was no seasoning on the shrimp and nothing in the salad but cojita cheese and tortilla strips and too much dressing. I would have loved some big slices of avocado...after all it is a SoCal restaurant! I'll try tacos next time unless they make their salads a little more flavorful. Also strange that you pay a waitress to bring you a drink from a fountain that is right in front of you. I like being served at a restaurant, but if you choose to dine in it would be nice to at least have real glassware and silverware instead of plastic."}
{"text":"2nd time to So Cal and it was as great as the last! The Mexican Shrimp Cocktail is packed with big fat fresh shrimp, almost like a ceviche, but very good. I ordered just regular fish tacos and they were delicious, I LOVED THE RICE, just perfect and our waitress was sweet and attentive. Met one of the owners while there, nice guy and excited that we were excited! 

I don't know why anyone would give this place one star, but everything was great! 

Others in my group had the ahi tacos and clam chowder and loved them both."}
{"text":"Had the tamale, it was pretty good. Blackened grouper taco was pretty good as well. I would suggest giving it a chance."}
{"text":"By far the best fish tacos in AZ. I have tried other items off the menu as well and all have been awesome! HIGHLY recommend for all of you seafood lovers. They have amazing crap cakes, a good fish sandwich, and superb shrimp tacos. Priced very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Great beer battered fish. Tortilla didn't seem fresh as they were a bit stiff. Portions a bit small compared to local competition. Being from San Diego just expected a little bit more food for the price. Beans and rice were flavorful but again kids portion (think Rubio's portion). If they manage to break the size barrier I would be back. Great atmosphere reminded me of home."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Shrimp Tacos.  Service was great - the food came out quickly.  Food is awesome.  I don't normally like pinto beans but these are awesome!  I came for lunch - but I just told my wife I'd be down to go back for dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Tried the Mahi Tacos. Served with beans and rice. Rice was good but the beans were nothing special.  The tacos were refreshing.
My only complaint was the owner/manager had a bit of an attitude and kept criticising the servers, who I thought were doing a fine job."}
{"text":"First time, not impressed. Seating is mostly outdoors and with the weather these days not comfortable at all. Water drips on you and your food from the misters. Food is good, but not expectacular for the  prices; chips n salsa are extra. Overall it lacks ambiance and the manger needs to put a smile even during cahos. Orders get mixed up, too many hands taking food to tables."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Relaxed atmosphere and incredible food! Best shrimp taco I've ever had. The ahi tuna taco was also very delicious. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Compared to La Santisima, this taco shop was a step down - same price but not nearly as good. The fish was well spiced and well cooked, but the tortilla did not hold up to the salsa or the fish. Halfway through both tacos, the tortilla just broke - a taco crime!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is WAY overpriced for what you're getting. I had the cod tacos, which were good. However, the tacos were pretty small and not tasty enough to be worth $9 by themselves. 

My wife got the carnitas tacos and those weren't good at all. The meat had no flavor and the tacos were minuscule. 

The calamari fries were pretty good, and the aioli sauce that came with it was tasty. 

So, if you like Rubios I'd suggest going there over this place, or go to Mangos in Mesa. Your bill will be cheaper and the food will be better."}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place, but it was just bad. I got the Fish and Chips and won't be getting it again. It wasn't cooked all the way, wasn't crispy at all and the annoying part was it was $7 for two little pieces of fish and hardly any fries. My date got the fish tacos, but where was the fish? It was all mangos and veggies. Sorry, but were not impressed."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  We started with the clam strips and then had the SHARK tacos and the beer battered magi tacos!  So delicious with a good beer which they have a good little selection!  The service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Good fish tacos, had the Mahi Mahi. My only sad face was they don't give chips with the salsa."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it...grew up in Huntington Beach, surfing in Baja (ensenada, rosarita, etc).  Raised at Wahoo's Fish Tacos and have a decent palate when it comes to fish tacos.  

Service was fine.  nice folks, speed was good.  The decor/patio gave me hope.

Our Group Ordered:  Quesadilla.  Shrimp Tacos.  Mahi Tacos.  Blackened Grouper tacos.

Quesadilla:  $4 for 1 store bought tortilla basically warmed in a microwave.  Like you would make for a snack for a toddler at home.  Weak.  

Shrimp Tacos:  decent.  Server said there were 5 shrimp per taco, mine had 3 shrimp.  Much better at cafe rio up the street.

Mahi Tacos:  lacking flavor.  Looked good.  let down.  wouldn't order these again.

Blackened Grouper:  also, lacked flavor, but the best of the 3 i ordered.  Note:   as i understand it, \"blackened\" is both a way of cooking (using butter/oil to char the fish, plus usually a cajun/pepper spice).  Again....this is NOT Wahoo's \"blackened\" fish  

Tap water:  awful.  even w/ lemon.  Get drinks...or soda water at least.

I will return, as i want them to succeed....I will try the other taco's and update.

Happy Hour: Mon - Thurs i will try the Cod Tacos...i think they are $1 buck a piece"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was awesome.  Unfortunately, while we were eating we saw what appeared to be the owner of the restaurant park his giant pickup truck in the disabled parking space.  After he unloaded some supplies, he continued to leave it parked in the disabled parking space.  I saw an elderly woman with a walker walk past his giant truck and go to the main lot because there weren't any more available parking spaces for disabled people.  Because of this, I am giving a low rating and won't return."}
{"text":"Great cod tacos! Really good customer service as well."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, and what a find it was!!  The shrimp tacos are amazing.  I can't stop thinking about them.  I would drive to Gilbert just for those tacos.  I also ordered the steamed clams.  If you're from New England, be prepared, as these are the hard shell clams from New Jersey.  Still very good, but not the big bellied, soft-shelled clams from New England.  I also ordered crab cakes... they were just okay.  Tasty.  Would I order them again?  Maybe.  The clam chowder was pretty good.  Not the best I've had, but certainly worthy of a A in my book.  It wasn't overly spiced.  Sometimes clam chowder is packed with too much black pepper, but this wasn't, and it was good.  Chunks of clams.  When I'm craving a taste of home, I'll be heading to this little joint.  (Maybe next time will try some of their micro-brews.)  I have to say for Arizona seafood fare, I will certainly be going back."}
{"text":"My parents love to eat here. The chips and salsa are pretty good. I really liked their fish tacos. They didn't have that fishy taste to them and they cooked perfectly  . It looks like it is small but they a really nice patio area that is great before the heat comes"}
{"text":"Not impressed! Service was just 'OK'. Ordered a water and it tasted like chemicals. Ceviche was decent. My wife got horribly sick from her ahi tuna tacos. Had it coming out of both ends if you know what I mean! Won't be heading back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food. My wife had the clam chowder and it was fantastic. The Mexicali shrimp cocktail was amazing.  The ahi tuna tacos were very good and so were the grouper tacos.  My wife had the sangria and it was great. They make it homemade and its not that sweet. Its a small place in old town Gilbert and it has a patio. The owner is cool. A must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place was just 'OK'.

Service (2 stars): There were no patrons inside, which was great! It was such a nice night out that everyone was out on the patio. That said, my expectations for immediate service was way up there (there goes wishful thinking). 

The young lady originally outside on a break came in to greet us. She brought us menus and politely mentioned that our \"server\" would be with us shortly. After about 10 mins, said server approached us and said he'd be right back to take our order. His name was Jared.

Hmmm...so we wait The young lady circled back and took our drink order. Shortly thereafter, she took our food order. Where is Jared and why hasn't he returned? 

No chip n salsa? Why am I paying $3 for chips and salsa?  This establishment os clearly listed Mexican, so I'm expecting chips n salsa...free of charge.

Food (3 stars): While it was awesomely fantastic it wasn't horribly bad either. I ordered Shrimp tacos at the suggestion of the waitress while the juvenile ordered Fish n Chips. My belly was full so no real complaints. Waste not, want not.

Establishment Cleanliness (3 stars): The bathroom had paper towels on the floor which meant no one was tending to it regularly. With the inside being completely empty (again, myself and the juvenile only) so I expected to see swept floors and wiped down tables. 

We sat at a table near what appeared to be the entrance/exit to the Cocina. Was NOT expecting to see trash bins barreled out past the table I was eating at. Aren't there back doors for that? 

Overall they get 2.6 stars, but since I can't rate in that manner I guess they get the benefit of a round up"}
{"text":"This place is killer.  Takes me back to the beach every time I eat there!  ANY of their fish tacos are to die for as well as the calamari and clam chowder!  Would eat here any day over their rival Joyride across the street.  Well done SoCal... Well done!"}
{"text":"Cute boys & great food! The grouper fish tacos are AMAZING. I tried a few appetizers and wasn't disappointed. Overall great food for a good price.  Love."}
{"text":"Super yummy and filling! We will defiantly be back. We had 3 different kinds of tacos at the table and they were all amazing!!!! Everything was absolutely delicious!!! The ice cream sandwich that finished it all off was just the icing on the cake! Small and cozy but with a great outdoor space this is a great place for a date or to meet a friend for lunch or dinner. Very reasonably priced!! Great little find!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with the wife during their  'soft' opening. I believe the problems we had will be worked out. Wait for a table wasn't bad, got sat outside and had to play musical chairs a bit to not sit in a sunny spot or a spot getting dripped on by the misting system. 

Got the crab cakes to start with, which were excellent. I got the shrimp po-boy, and the wife got the fish and chips.

Fish and chips were a tad to thick on the batter. The shrimp on the po-boy was a corn-meal crusted fried shrimp, pretty good as well.

I dislike tarter sauce, but the 'house' tarter sauce is really excellent!

My only disappointment was the lack of any other 'house' sauces. In all my \"So-Cal\" fish tacos experiences, each place had an assortment of their very own specialty sauces. The lack of anything but tarter here was a disappointment.

tl;dr 4 stars for now, it's still too new and has some issues to work through, it'll be a 5 star soon enough."}
{"text":"Finally got around to visiting this place and it was better than expected. Saturday night and the place was full - for good reason. Nice fresh blue point oysters on the half shell, steamed clams ( steamed in broth which was almost better than the clams!). Fish ceviche - tasty, fresh - actually got one to go. Tamale del Mar with pablanos - didn't overwhelm the seafood. All the sides - slaw, beans, rice weren't swimming in whatever sauce which made them stand out for their own taste. Definitely will revisit - have to try the tacos next time! Don't know why we didn't but all the other items looked great and were great."}
{"text":"We had high hopes but were let down. Service was very good. We went at 6ish on a Thursday and were seated indoors right away. Staff was friendly and attentive and we always had full drinks!  Food was just okay. The batter seemed too heavy (fish and chips and cod tacos) and meal was pretty bland. I guess it lacked what I'd call that \"fresh\" taste. Now I understand that because we live in the desert we will never get fish tacos like they serve in CA but...."}
{"text":"The Republic gave this place 4 stars and i agree.  Unique little place.  Food is fresh, service is good, and the patio is great too.  Went for lunch with my wife and we were impressed.  Two mahi tacos stuffed with mahi mahi and fresh mango for 7 bucks!  You would be hard pressed tonget street tacos at that price.  We had clam chowder for 3 dollars that was house made.  The chowder was excellent.  Go to Paradise Bakery for canned chowder and pay twice that price.  Also had the steamed clams.  We got two dozen clams in a bucket for 9 dollars!  They were fresh and sand free.

I will be straight forward here.  This is the kind of place you'd find in a coastal town except the quantity is better.  If your looking for a casual, flip flop wearing locale to have awesome food and a cold Corona this is the place.  Local small business with fresh made food.  Highly recommended!

Also, they have a solid selection of San Diego micro brews."}
{"text":"Great chicken soup! My favorite, service is always excellent. Love coming here with the family."}
{"text":"Yum. Blackened grouper tacos. Yum. Mahi tacos ate good if you eant something milder. All that was missing was the sand."}
{"text":"Food was a little cold. Do not try the clam chowder. Don't really understand how it can be award winning. Wanted it to be so much better. Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. This place reminded me of the beach. Look no further for the best fish taco."}
{"text":"the lobster tacos over priced, bland and taste rubbery. The ceviche tacos are very bland and also overpriced. If you ever had authentic or half decent seafood tacos you will be disappointed. If you want to sit out in a nice patio and have a beverage this could be the place, just make sure you eat before you arrive!"}
{"text":"Just left and the food was terrible. The scallops had no flavor, had to kill the taste of the fish with ketchup and tarter sauce, clam chowder tasted like a bowl of flower, and the tortilla soup was nothing but beans. Never going back. So-crappy fish taco company!!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Tried almost everything on the menu and it's all good.  Unique thing about So Cal is it's clean food, not drowned in melted cheese and sauce.  And yet it's so flavorful!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD and good VALUE! ....However...I will NEVER understand how OWNERS, GM's, Floor Managers do not prepare their servers and require their servers to perform the BASICS of GREAT service!!  Simple Steps of Service!!   How are you folks doing today?.....Great my name is BLANK.....HAVE YOU FOLKS been here before???  Yes?  Welcome BACK!  NO?  Welcome for the first time!!  EXPLAIN WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR!!!!!!  YOUR FAVORITES....ANY SPECIALS....SUGGEST ITEMS!!!   Take an order....anticipate needs...drink refills etc. CHECK BACK....is everything cooked properly????  Is everyone SATISFIED and happy....Wonderful.  THANK YOUR GUEST FOR THEIR BUSINESS....there are a ZILLION other places to eat especially in AZ!!  Let them know of other days specials...   GOOD GOD how does this not happen???   You know what this is???  Its called CUSTOMER SERVICE....and it separates the winners from the losers!  Good Luck!!"}
{"text":"Best date night while in town. Amazing prices and even better food! Service was outstanding and the staff super-friendly. Margaritas were great, peel and eat shrimp were outstanding and the oysters with the atomic uber-good horseradish and beer battered fish tacos left us wanting more. Whenever we visit Gilbert we'll come visit!"}
{"text":"This place was recommend think I expected better. I had the ahi tuna tacos and it was cold. Very bland tasting. The salsa really didn't have any flavor to it and margarita I've had better"}
{"text":"Nothing So Cal about it.  Salsa tastes like it's shipped in from Idaho.  My homemade salsa is the bomb, and i found it insulting that you represent that salsa as So Cal.   I would never bring my friends from LA to this place.  Echhhh. The food is less than marginal, and I find it irritating to pay a high price for marginal food far from authentic.  If the food is excellent, I don't mind paying top dollar.  So Cal needs authenticity, better recipes, better menu and a few tips from us Southern Californians.  Get the fried fish out of there.  Where in California do they sell fish and chips in a Mexican food restaurant?  Definitely not in LA, which is my hometown.  Sorry, but I don't buy it.  Next stop, that other stupid \"street taco\" place that just opened up on Gilbert Rd  Get over yourselves....  Same review...less than marginal with crap for salsa....."}
{"text":"We made our first visit to SoCal Fish Taco Company today and had a fantastic lunch and great service! Our server, Mario, was attentive, engaging, and gave us a lot of background information about the history of the business, and made for a very enjoyable time. We were joined at lunch by friends who we hadn't seen for a while and spent about three hours with them, but never felt pressured to leave our patio table.

SoCal offers a great menu variety of fish & seafood tacos, and other seafood appetizers and meals. There were some delicious daily specials, craft beers, and very affordable prices. Everyone in our group agreed that we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I had heard and read about how great this place was. Reality didn't match the hype. I had the calamari. It was okay and for $9, I expected a larger portion. The cod tacos were okay as well. A little too much breading. I will say the clam chowder was very good. My son had the fish and chips. He really liked it. Overall experience was okay; food was average and service was good. Id go back and try it again, but it is a bit over hyped."}
{"text":"We love Baja style fish tacos like you find in San Diego. This is the real deal. Wide variety of fish tacos are offered all very good. Fried shrimp is a light batter like you get on the Gulf Coast. Chowder is excellent."}
{"text":"I had the Maui and shark tacos with mango salsa. This place is awesome!!  I'm originally from Nebraska and found this place today. The management was awesome too!!  I had 30 in nutes before I had to be to work and I was in and out in 15 minutes and they are very busy! Price is awesome too. And I'm cheap!  $12 for two great sized tacos, rice, beans and a soda."}
{"text":"This place gets better every time we come.  Fresh ingredients, generous portions and a great vibe.  Try the beer battered lobster tacos if they have them. The salmon and Maui tacos are also a must."}
{"text":"Good service. I had the grouper which was good. My sister had the shrimp tacos which she enjoyed. The salsa was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Got the Loco tacos. Not nearly enough seafood in the tacos and the beans and rice were in tiny side cups. Tasted good but not enough fish."}
{"text":"What a great find!  The food was good and the service was outstanding.  Very family friendly.  The entire staff was really attentive and nice. I went with my young nephew and little niece after a couple hours of play time. They were starving. The staff let us order while we waited for a table. They gave the kids a cold drink while waiting. I had the lobster tacos special and the kids each had mac n cheese and quesadilla (they call it crisp). We all three finished our plates. In the 30 minutes we were there. The server came by three times to check on us and to chat. The kids and I agree that we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Happy hour was great. Food is good beer prices ok. Waitress screwed up the 2 tabs that our party had. We told the waitress and she said even Pabs the owner could not fix them. My wife said you can go try.  The waitress responded \"your not my mother\". That was shocking but it gets better. The manager Matt corrected our tabs. Then we paid and he came back. Upon his return we asked him about the \"mother\" comment. His reply was that they see their staff as equals to the paying customers and the waitress felt insulted that we noticed she screwed up our tabs and requested that they be fixed. We were talking down to her and it was ok that she made the mother comment. Even my ultra relaxed friend (the owner of the other wrong tab) was pissed. It is the first time in my life that a manager of a restaurant told four of the seven people in the place he did not need their business. At that point I openly told Matt he sucked as a manager and we would not return. Matt must not know Slow Ride is across the street. It is rare that I get out to happy hour and get the wife to drive. Like Matt says our time and money are better spent across the street."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Got there about 1pm, and was seated within 10 minutes.  Ordered 1/2 dozen oysters and a basket of clam strips.  Oysters were great!  being able to get fresh oysters in Gilbert is a great treat.  Now to the clam basket.  Should have known better, but it's just your standard frozen, chewy breaded clam strips.  They were also way over cooked.  Would be happy to pay more for freshly shucked fried clams.  

Will try tacos and steamers next time."}
{"text":"Great environment and outdoor seating these limited spring days. Wonderful service but mediocre food. Enjoy drinks but skip the bland food."}
{"text":"Just ate at So Cal fish tacos with my girlfriend. We both thought the tacos were excellent along with the sides of rice and beans. She had one complaint, which I didn't think about until she brought it up. From a purely recyclable point of view, it would be nice if not all of the food containers are throw away plastic. That being said, the place it great with a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Servers had poor manners when it comes to discussing internal business in front of the customers i.e. I don't want to hear how many tables they each have. The chowder was very good but the portion size of the entrees were so small I thought I must have ordered off the kids menu. The 2 pieces of beer battered cod were slightly bigger than the sad frozen refried French fries. For $8.not worth it. First and last visit."}
{"text":"Cute concept, but very mediocre. We went into this restaurant hoping to find some good mexican food in Gilbert, but were disappointed by the food. We ordered the fish taco, clam chowder, and oyster. The clam chowder and oyster were both below average. The oyster was warm and sort of gross. The clams in the chowder were chewy. The fish taco was average at best. Hard to justify eating here when Joyride is right across the street..."}
{"text":"Love the food here! They buffalo style fried shrimp they have on happy hour is so good. Drinks are also good. Service is either hit or so-so. But I have yet to have a bad visit yet."}
{"text":"I love the food and I've eaten there frequently but I've found it's better to stick to to-go's. Everytime I've eaten in, the service isn't great. This last time I brought a group of friends, 5 total. 3 got there before the others and ordered chips and salsa, drinks and some tacos. They had to ask 4 times for the chips. Then when meals for all of us came, they brought them out two at a time. The 5th meal didn't come out for a full 15 minutes. My friend sat there waiting for her meal. Server wasn't attentive (we asked for napkins several times, drinks weren't refilled). Also, as we sat on patio, a busser went to take down an umbrella from a table to fit a larger party (push the tables together). He ended up hitting a lady at another table and we were ducking and moving out of the way. A guy at another table offered to help him but he said no and kept trying to move it. It was something out if a comedy routine (turn with a large item, people ducking under). 

They also seemed to have a problem with their phones for a while. Either it would be busy, or the call would disconnect after ringing a few times. They don't have a hold system as I called one time for an order and the server asked me to hold on. It was then obvious he just placed the phone down and I could hear everything going on. I stayed on the line for about 10 minutes and by then was in the area and just went in to place the order. When I walked in, the phone was still off the hook and now had the dial tone. So for at least 15 minutes no one would have been able to get through. 

So in short I love this place for the food, but there needs to be a lot more attention to the service and the ultimate atmosphere.

Between myself, friends and fiancé, we've had a few of the tacos, appetizers, soup. Everything is pretty good. Tacos are awesome. The po boy sandwhich was literally a roll with a piece of fried fish on it. No sauces, nothing else. While presentation looked like it came from Denny's. It paled in comparison to tacos. 

2 stars for service. 4/5 for food."}
{"text":"Ugh! What a Friday night. 

I'll have to say this review is about the lack of customer service and the lack of compassion and not so much about the food as that was o.k.

My family and I came here for dinner on our way out I made the mistake of leaving my car keys on the table.  I recognize and understand that leaving my keys is my fault but a little bit of care, compassion, and understanding is something that any good business will provide to their customers  in order to keep clientele. Well what can I say unfortunately that was not the case at this locale the buss boy and manager were both on the defensive the entire time and offered no assistance what so ever on the contrary the manager accused me of saying something I did not say mind you there were 2 witnesses who heard what I indeed did say and can account for what was actuallu said. Then the manager went on to say because of what I supposedly said we no longer had the access to their trash can to see if our  keys  were thrown out mind you during our entire time there was no inappropriate language or accusations made on our end all we were wanting was a little help finding my keys instead I had to initially go through a trash can with no gloves because non were offered (mind you the manager was standing right next to me going through this can because he said he had to monitor me going through the can) finally after my husband complained gloves were brought out. Then we were given the bag of trash and were told we had to go dig through it by the dumpster and that was that they wiped there hands clean from the situation. 

I have never experienced such awful treatment from restaurant management needless to say we will never return to this place and would never recommend it to others."}
{"text":"So Cal catered our wedding! I love them and their food! Pablo and his buddy are the best! Next time, I need a caterer, they are it! Everybody loved their food! The Fish ceviche and shrimp tacos were the bomb! Thank you for a great experience SoCal!"}
{"text":"I give them two stars because 1, the hostess was nice & 2, the decor was refreshing... 
Our waiter could have been friendly enough to deserve a bigger tip but at least he was attentive enough to refill our drinks a few times. 

For starters we ordered the $7 calamari fries. It was DELICIOUS. The pieces were thick and the batter was light enough. It came with a side of yummy aioli sauce & marinara, which I thought was a little odd.

I ordered the shrimp Po boy. It was disappointing. Three medium deep-fried shrimp with the tail still on, in between large pieces of white bread. Lettuce, onion & tomatoes came on the side. The tartar sauce was bland. The seasonless fries was the only good part of the dish. 

My other half ordered the fish and chips. It came with two medium size pieces of deep-fried cod and french fries. All you taste is the oil. That too was very disappointing.

If my commute wasn't  30 minutes away from Phoenix I would check out the happy hour since they do offer one dollar cod and tilapia tacos."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos around!!! owner is a true food fanatic and gets it as his family owns another High Quality Seafood Restaurant that has been around 25 plus years... Incredible Fish and Chips at a great price for a quick lunch!! best homemade cocktail sauce around!! great atmosphere and location!! always upbeat staff and treated very well and food is always prefect and ready to go on a phone call, walk in, or sit down meal!!! Highly recommended!!!! great chips and salsa and true  baja shrimp cocktails, along with a variety of other meals!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been waiting for weeks for the So-Cal Fish Taco Company to open in downtown Gilbert. We are locals who frequent four great restaurants already in that section of town (e.g., Postino, Joe's B.B.Q., Oregano's, and Liberty Market).  

First impression matters: It was crowded on the first Friday night opening. We were told there was a one hour wait.  This helped us decide on takeout.  

The fish tacos were nice and crunchy, but we felt that there could have been more fish sauce & cotija cheese.

The carnitas tacos were a little dry to us.  The beans tasted as if they were canned beans.  In house cooked beans have a fresher taste to them.  

As Parents we were concerned that we didn't see a children's menu.  This could still be in the making, however.    

Service was fast for the to go order. Service was friendly. (Still finding their way in terms of organizing the crowd, but we think that is normal for a restaurant that has just opened.)  

We see this venue becoming a local favorite if they subscribe to the enduring idea that quality drives business and customer service matters.  

Haven't had the clam chowda yet but since we spent ten years in Boston we are ready to offer our thoughts after our next visit."}
{"text":"Really good food, but ridiculously small portions for the prices.  Even rice and beans come in little condiment dishes..."}
{"text":"Always go get chips and salsa and they have great clam chowder soup and talipa fish tacos."}
{"text":"First visit to So-Cal, and loved it! We skipped the tacos on this first visit, and opted instead for the clam chowder, steamed clams, and crab cakes.  What a great choice we made, since all were outstanding.  Excellent beer list too.

We're originally from New England, and we've had hundreds of versions of clam chowder.  So-Cal's version is one of the best I've ever had.  The clams were perfect and not rubbery, the broth was just the right consistency, and the seasoning was spot on.  Amazing.

The steamed clams were brilliant.  It's easy to destroy the little gems, but So-Cal hit the nail on the head.  Sweet, succulent, and also cooked to perfection in a nice light buttery broth that did not over power the cherrystone size clams.

The crab cakes were full of crab, with just the right amount of well seasoned binding.  Outstanding.  

Now that we've savor end the \"sides\",  we'll be back soon to try the many versions of tacos, and other offerings that are sure to exceed our expectations.

GLAD YOU'RE IN TOWN, SO-CAL!!!!  What a great addition to historic downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good service, I usually get the fish and chips or the lobster tacos. I would recommend trying them out just once and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Patio is great. The owners are really nice and helpful. Just a good family owned restaurant and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is pretty good but the service today sucked. The server we had acted like we were a bother and he didn't follow up on the food. When the food came we were missing some simple sauces for my wife's tacos and we also asked for more napkins. After fifteen minutes I had to get up ad ask the manager if he could get it for is. Our server came out with like ten knack ins and dropped a small container of Baha sauce in the middle of the table and walked off. What an asshat. Won't be back. I'll make sure my friends no longer patronize this establishment either. Joyride is across the street and they have much better service not to mention food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their fish tacos. In fact, I can't order them anywhere else now or I will be disappointed! The only drawback to this restaurant is that I have a small child and they have no changing table in the bathroom. I pointed this out to the owner and he said that they were going to get one, but as of now they still don't have one. This makes this a very unattractive choice for a place to eat in the summertime, as if I have to change a diaper, it's either do it in the restaurant or do it in a hot car. Both options are bad."}
{"text":"Went to So Cal Tacos for the first time today.  I ordered the Corona Beer Battered Mahi Tacos and my husband ordered the Tacos Locos. They were both delicious! The breading on the Mahi was light and crispy with an excellent flavor.  The tacos both came with a side of nicely seasoned rice and a side of beans.  The interior restaurant is small but friendly.   We sat in the covered outdoor patio area which offered a mist system and televisions.  Our waiter, Mario, was professional and very friendly.  He informed us that the fish is ordered from a Southern California distributor who is also a family member of the owner.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to branch out lately. I've really been into fish tacos so we thought we'd give them a try. 
When we walked in it took a little to be noticed. I'm used to being greeted right away and \"I'll be with you\" but that didn't happen. When we were greeted, they said to sit anywhere. 
Someone then brought us menus, and plastic forks. The plastic forks were placed right on top of the menu with no napkins.... That seemed unsanitary and really turned off my husband. 
We got the crab cakes and the beer battered mahi tacos. It states on the menu that you get beans and rice for sides. 
We waited a little but they were pretty busy so the wait was what was expected. When we got our food, we were both surprised by how tiny the sides were for the tacos! It was in a small cup the size of the cups you put ketchup or mustard in! 
Our waitress said she would bring us napkins, and never did. Again, it was busy... But still.
The crab cakes were good. Not anything special. The tarter sauce that came with it tasted like ranch dressing. Again nothing special. 
The fish tacos were bigger then most I've seen. They had an odd taste though. We think it may be the cheese they choose. 
At the end when we got our check and saw that for the small amount of food we got cost $20, we both decided we will not be going back based on the price for the quality and portion size."}
{"text":"This review is really not so much for the food but actually with our experience afterwards. I met my sister including her husband and the rest of my family. My sister and bro in law left their keys on top of the table, my mom and bro in law and I saw them unfortunately no one picked them up. We went across the street to liberty market to grab dessert. When my sister realized she had left her keys we returned to SoCal, the keys mysteriously not being their anymore. Mind you we searched our pockets, liberty market (btw shout out they were super helpful unlike SoCal), bags you name it. We went back a second time just in case, asked the management if they could possibly look through the regular garbage because there is a possibility that the key may have been thrown out. I have a lot experience in the restaurant and food service; I was a manager myself. I have seen this happen before myself unfortanutely, this is when all the problems started. 

I brought the situation to the bus boy. Right off the bat he had an extremely defensive, dissmissive and unhelpful attitude. All I had asked was if he had seen any keys and that they may POSSIBLY be in the garbage. Right off the bat he say \"I'm not digging through the garbage and I didn't throw your keys\". Then this punk just tell me \"Well I'm just cleaning the table here\" and just starts wiping down a perfectly clean table already and dismisses me. I have to ask this kid to get the manager when that should have been the case to begin with. 

Manager comes by gives nothing but excuses. He was ademant that someone walking by could have grabbed the keys (we were sitting outside). We explained that may have been a possibility BUT so could have someone accidentally thrown them in the garbage. My sister asked if the garbage can could be brought over just in case the keys could have been accidentally thrown away. This manager (unfortanutely I didn't catch his name) would not help and would not even bother to at least acknowledge what was going on. Sister starts digging through the garbage without gloves! 

The manager didn't even bother to stop my sister. He then directed all three of us to go to the dumpster for all three of is to dig through bags of garbage. This was after giving all three of us attitude for just trying to find the only set of keys to the car. I will say that it was understood by us that we as the party understand it was our fault for misplacing the keys. What was unnaceptable and definitely not appreciated was the defensive, dissmisive and lack of acknowledgement from the budget, waiter and staff and lack of help overall. My sister and brother in law had to end up towing their car. I will never come back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"So here we are in historic downtown Gilbert enjoying the magnificent day, in other words not too hot ;0)
Lines for every place to eat... Don't want to wait 30 for lunch. Cruised cross street and found this gem! I live in So Cal but do not have a place this tasty! The steamed muscles were amazing, fresh and sauce was top notch. The calamari strips were wonderful, tender and crunchy batter was lite. Also had oysters on half shell. Not from the day but still lovely. The sauce needed some flavor but they supplies extra horseradish for mixing.plenty of parking in back. Some seating inside and plenty in back outside. I would frequent this establishment if didn't take me 6.5 hours to get too!"}
{"text":"My daughter, future daughter in law and I ate here for the first time. Pablo the owner was extremely knowledgeable and informative about all the items on the menu. We had for appetizers the clam chowder soup - fresh, filling and light. The flavors exploded in our mouth and I enjoyed the soup since it didn't feel like I was eating a ton of heavy cream which is sometimes all you can taste at other restaurants.  

We all LOVED the fact that you can order two types of different fish tacos if you want. It is very evident that Pablo wants his customers to be happy with what they order. We ordered swordfish tacos, beer battered lobster taco, and shrimp tacos - all were yummy! We thought the food was extremely fresh and flavorful.  In addition, we were able to substitute a side salad for the rice and beans. The salad had a fabulous lime Cesar dressing which was to die for.

We can't wait to eat here again. Service was outstanding, quick and friendly and food was delicious...what more do you want when you go out to eat!!! The prices were very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Was hungry for a fish taco, and went to yelp to search for the best. This place is fantastic. My wife had the fish and chips dinner, and I had the beer battered lobster taco. It was very very good. Servers were personable and attentive. Hats off, we will be back again. Five stars my review

Bill - Mesa Az."}
{"text":"Fish portions are much smaller than others I have had.  Only 1 tortilla?  Generally 2 is customary especially when you have sauces and salsa!  Flavor was ok.  Soup - chowder - was cold."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fish taco fan. I do like the non fish tacos here as well as the side dishes. They usually have good beer also. Wouldn't be my first choice for tacos but the people I usually eat with enjoy the fish tacos and say they are the best around. I find the fish a bit fishy."}
{"text":"Cute taco restaurant in Gilbert. The decor & ambiance made me miss California! Service was good, they kindly accommodated our request to sit outside. Food was ok, pretty good but not too authentic tasting. I would love to try some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Short & Sweet

Impeccable fresh oysters!
Great fried Shrimp!
Good beer.
Fresh, though simple salad.
Ask for your fries \"well done\".
I wish they had gelato for the perfect dessert."}
{"text":"Every things works at this place.  Service (Mario) was spot on and amazing.  Mango Margaritas out of this world. Oysters in the half shell sooo fresh.  This place is top notch."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice; we sat outside by a fire. The tacos were amazing! I highly recommend the tacos locos - delicious!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool place! The ambiance is neat ... I felt like I was eating seafood in Southern California vs. Arizona.  I've never been to downtown Gilbert for dinner.  This was my first time and I really enjoyed it.  The weather was perfect over the weekend so after leaving the Harvest Festival in Chandler, we decided to head over to downtown Gilbert for diner.  While walking in downtown Gilbert we noticed the Happy Hour sign at SoCal so we (my partner and his 2 children) stopped in. 

We ate outside because the weather was perfect.  Inside was a little gloomy.  I ordered oysters on the half shell and clam chowder to start.  If you've read any of my previous reviews you'll see that I ALWAYS order oysters on the half shell and clam chowder for an appetizer if the restaurant has it.  No expectations here!  I went for it.  The oysters were pretty tasty but small.  They were blue point oysters for all my East Coast seafood lovers.  The clam chowder was more like clam soup instead of clam chowder.  It was thin and soupy but taste pretty darn good.  I like my clam chowder chunky and thick so although it taste good I wouldn't order it again.  I also order a Loca (grilled tilapia) taco and a Cod (fried fish) taco.  Both were really, really good!
My partner ordered the shrimp po' boy. I didn't try it but  he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Years ago I vowed to never try a Shrimp Po' Boy outside of New Orleans because every time I have they were just Blah.  

My partner however, loved it!  It's served with all of the fixings on the side so you sort of build your own Po'Boy.  He also ordered a Cod Taco and loved it.  The little one ordered chicken tenders, fries and mandarin oranges.  He quickly ate the fries and oranges and took a few bites of the chicken tenders.  HE said they tasted like fish sticks.  They looked like fish sticks for sure. I tried a small piece, the fish stick he taste was in the batter, meaning they fry the chicken tenders in the same grease as the fish.  It wasn't that big of a deal but it's an FYI for those with little ones. The really cool thing about the kids meal is the food is served on a Frisbee for keepsake.  We all thought that was a really nice touch!  Because I read a few yelp reviews while we waited for our food, I knew not to order any drinks.  Overall, I'd visit SoCal Fish Taco Company again for happy hour."}
{"text":"Food was good. Would go back. Thought was a little pricey for the amount of food. Had the lobster tacos, couldn't really taste lobster but was still good. The calamari fries are fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Fish and Shrimp Tacos I've had. The Mexicali Shrimp Cocktail was exquisite! This isn't your normal American Shrimp Cocktail... It is a traditional Mexican style cocktail with shrimp broth, Clamato, chopped vegetables, avocados, served with a side of light flavored and salted chips. I also ordered the blackened grouper taco and the seasoned shrimp taco. Delicious! My wife had the fried fish which was cooked perfect too! Highly recommend but get there early because come Friday or the weekend around 4:30pm...it will be packed and you'll wait up to 2 hours for a table."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Service was great, love the decor, and the food tasted fresh. I got the shrimp po boy and the only thing it needed was the classic spicy mayo... Great back bone for something that is going to be a local favorite. Definitely coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"The tacos were ok. Pretty small amount of tacos for a taco place. The rice they give u is so small, I was shocked. It is in a small condiment bowl. Their calamari fries are good but prob won't come back. Their prices are higher ESP for such small amount of food. I'm glad we tried it tho"}
{"text":"Very good place for good tasty food. Beans and rice are ok but the tacos, tamale and salmon wraps are amazing"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to SoCal for the first time and were greeted immediately and sat right away on the patio (at 5:30 on a Friday). We were approached right away and ordered the shrimp cocktail ($7). It came with 5 large shrimp on ice and was very fresh. The cocktail sauce had a tad too much horseradish for my taste but was still good. We weren't very hungry so we split the Mahi tacos (two for $7), but they were a pretty decent size, larger than street tacos. The fish was fresh and it came with a mango chutney, cotija cheese and some cabbage. They didn't over do the cabbage or toppings and the salsa that came on the side was delicious. Our server was prompt with the bill and we had an overall great experience. I hope they stay consistent and worthy of five stars!"}
{"text":"Really good local place here in downtown Gilbert.   I had the Locos Tacos and it was really good.  I'd definitely recommend this place.  Service was great, too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so disappointed in the tacos. Super plain and almost raw tortillas and the flavor was bland. We got the mahi and the grouper and both were not good. The price is affordable, but I would pay more for better flavor and quality somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great local joint that feels like part of the neighborhood, a very non-corporate vibe with good fish tacos!  My only setback is the lack of bar choices."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and will be back for sure.  great quick service.  Food was EXCELLENT!  I had the salmon and chicken wrap and it was off the charts good."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and beer at a good price.  Nothing fancy,. But a great value and always good.   Nice back patio, with TVs and a mister and fans."}
{"text":"This place always delivers.   Food so fresh.  Service beyond amazing.  I have a hard time finding a place like this ten feet from the ocean and it's right here in Dunn Arizona.  The owner Pablo always greets me and he has a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best ceviche I've had since I was in Mexico! My mouth is watering even writing this review. My friend and I shared ceviche and some Mahi tacos and everything was so delicious. The place is small but very welcoming. They have a nice sized outside eating area as well. I saw that they have some awesome looking happy hour deals that I can't wait to go experience :)"}
{"text":"I was only impressed with the Seviche (hope i spelled that right). Other than that the place is more about the atmosphere than they are the food. The fish tacos were dry and lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Cozy taco shop in the heart of downtown Gilbert. The tacos here are fresh and tasty. While it wasn't too busy when we went so I can't really judge the service was great too!"}
{"text":"Place was good. It's best to eat outside as the inside is quite small. Food came out quick and the service was good. Only thing holding back from a five star is I could hear the employees from around the corner talking bad about guests that were sitting outside. I'm not sure what those guests but they ended up switching servers for that table. The team continued talking about that table for a good 20 minutes as we were eating."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  I had the salmon tacos and daughter had tortilla soup. Glad we tried it out. When it's cooler out we'll sit outside."}
{"text":"Great happy hour Mon-Thurs from 3-6pm! Tacos average $2. I got the chicken and tilapia tacos, both were delicious but not to be outshined by the fish ceviche tostada for $2.50! Everything tastes remarkably fresh. 

Love the decor and outdoor patio. For a little while,  I forgot I lived in Arizona. I felt like I was eating at a establishment near the beach in California."}
{"text":"After spending a week in San Diego I had some of the BEST shrimp tacos. And since then I have been constantly craving them, so my boyfriend and I came here hoping they might satisfy that craving. Well we were wrong.

We walked in and were instantly greeted, the host/ waiter told us there was gonna be quiet a wait for inside but they did a small bar to sit us at or we could sit outside. Not really wanting to be in the heat we opted to sit at the small \"bar\". That small bar was right behind the host counter, the waiter then told us this was actually and additional waiting area for customers. We sat there for not even a minuet before we asked if we could move outside. The \"bar\" was such a confined space we could barely sit comfortably. The waiter happily obliged, then took us to the patio.

While the patio was hot, it wasn't unbearable with the umbrella, misters, and fans. After over looking the menu, I decided on the shrimp tacos, and he the ahi tuna. They came out fairly quick, which was nice. But the tacos were nothing great. My tortillas were cold, like out of the fridge cold. There wasn't much flavor at all on the shrimp. The rice was white, which was odd, the beans were straight out of the can. What was really unfortunate was the fact the shrimp in my tacos still had a lot of the shell on them. Each bite I was pulling shell out of my mouth, my boyfriends tuna was almost all chewy, and uneatable. 

Needless to say, we won't be going back. There was nothing to bring me back to try their food again. Especially with the subpar service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and good food. Another great \"spot\" in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Awesome little find. Cute and very clean. SoCal Fish Taco Company has a great patio area, inside it pretty small only about eight tables. You will definitely get that California beach feel here. Service was attentive and friendly. Alicia suggested the Corona Beer Battered Tacos served with beans and rice all tasted great. Portion size was perfect. She also suggested the Tangerine Wheat Beer tasted like a orange soda. We also tried the Mexicali Shrimp Cocktail lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I'm not sure the hype here although admittedly I'm not a fish taco fanboy. The food was good, but I felt a bit expensive. If I want tacos I'd much rather go to Fuzzy's on Mill - bigger portions for less money. Nothing on the menu jumped out me here but I got the beer battered mahi tacos. Beans were awesome. GF got a vegetarian taco and wasn't impressed at all.

On a side note there was a guy there who I'd assume was the owner. While he didn't talk to me, he seemed like a dick."}
{"text":"OMG!!! How on earth have my wife and I not been here before? By far the best fish tacos, and tortilla soup we have EVER had!!! It is truly amazing. It's hard to believe it's only been around since 2013, as it has an amazing established feel about it. Oh, don't let me forget about the rice, for once a Spanish/Mexican rice that is truly fantastic. The beer battered tacos were so fresh, and juicy!!!
We have been to all the other restaurants in the heritage district, and this is the jewel of them all!!!
Don't hesitate to stop by this amazing restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"So-cal fish Co is a super cute downtown Gilbert restaurant! I have to firstly admit what a great job they did on the design, I literally felt like I was back in Southern California on their back patio. This back patio is perfect for enjoying some cold west coast beer, fresh fish tacos and juicy oysters. The service is great and all the staff were friendly and knowledgable. Our server happened to be the nephew of the owner who told us that his grandfather owns the Seafood Market Restaurant on baseline in Mesa. He told us how hard they work to get in the freshest  seafood in Phoenix and I can tell you that both the fish tacos and oysters were superbly delicious and great tasting. I had never heard of the Seafood Market but I am definitely planning on checking it out soon. But if your in downtown Gilbert this is a great place to go to."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos, and quick service for take out.  Reasonable prices, and great variety on the menu.  Only 4 stars because they're closed on Sundays, and because the carne asada was only average.  It seems like the carne asada, chicken, and carnitas are only on the menu to provide variety.  Their real specialty is the various fish tacos (cod, grouper, mahi, salmon, etc), so if you go for those, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"So-Cal is good! They have a huge outdoor patio and limited inside seating (which is probably bad for them with the extreme heat right now!). But the patio rocks any other time! And it's in the back so you don't have the busy Gilbert Rd traffic noise. 
The food is reasonably priced. I like the fried clams, fries and coleslaw. My husband likes the fish tacos. 
We love the little coronitas buckets. 
It's cute and a great addition to DT Gilbert. We are frequent lunch customers."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. There is a focus on atmosphere here, which pays itself off when combined with solid food offerings.

Where So-Cal Fish Taco Company shines is how it prepares its dish, clearly doing the research on tasting. The tacos are delightful, the flavors a journey of its own. The initial bite has you tasting well-marinated fish and the finish has you tasting the kick of well-mixed homemade salsa.

Service was rad, attentive, yet non-intrusive. Drinks were to be expected of a low-key seafood place with hipster music playing in the background.

Why dock a star then?

PORTIONS. Oh man, how small the portions were. If you're shelling out over $10 for a plate of tacos, do you really expect only two little tiny tacos? Man, if the flavors weren't good, I'd bring the review down to 3 stars. 

Keep this in mind, I'm going to keep the negatives short on this review, but just note that if you were in Seattle, $12 for a plate of tacos would go MUCH further for the portions you get."}
{"text":"Loved the Mahi tacos. Not a huge indoor seating area, but worth the wait. Or sit outside. Great atmosphere. Cold beer from So-Cal breweries."}
{"text":"We started with coconut shrimp and wow the flavor was magnificent. I also had a cup of the clam chowder and it was one of the best I've had. My wife got the tequila shrimp tacos and I got the blackened grouper. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"The SoCal Fish Taco Company has been hit or miss for me and the reason I say this is because there are several locations. The one I am particularly reviewing is the Redlands location. The setting is nice and there are usually lots of people in there but the last couple times that I have been in, my food has been quiet disgusting. My plate had water standing on it in what seemed like a quarter inch thick, it was pretty sick. I made sense of it in my mind because the grilled zucchini that comes with it could have been the reason but the more that I thought about, I couldn't justify that much water and feel like I could have done a better job cooking it myself. Other times, I couldn't order a certain menu item because they were sold out but no one thought to say anything until I waited in line for 20 minutes and got to the register to order and After making my order, they told me they were sold out. Just take it off the menu! The nice part was that the fish has always been cooked great, and the ambiance has always been nice. Lets work on the rest and I think they would have something special here. 

Thanks, 
MLA"}
{"text":"Calamari fries are amazing, but so is just about everything I've tried. This place is truly a gem and the staff is pretty awesome too. Just do it."}
{"text":"Didn't think it was that great. Over priced even for downtown Gilbert. Went by the owner but he didn't say anything or acknowledge.  I guess they don't need the repeat business.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"It looks like a nice place but I would not go back. The tortilla soup was good but tacos are not anything special. My husband said I make better ones at home. But the real issue I have with this place was the kids food. They serve the adults fresh food but all the kids food is from the freezer. I was very annoyed when my daughter ordered fish and chips and ended up with something that came from a freezer. I want my kids to eat fresh food, none of that freezer crap. I don't buy it from the grocery store, I certainly don't want it at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Gilbert really needs a great fish taco.. And this is it. I can't stop thinking about the calamari appetizer and fish n' chips entree (with the yummy dips) we enjoyed last week. Perfectly crunchiness and flakey meat on the inside of the cod. Temperature of food was piping hot and seasoning was spot on.

Staff was friendly and fairly attentive. Very cool patio furniture, lighting, but misters were a bit too powerful and got us more wet than we wanted. The price was not bad, it was $20 for an app and entree and we gobbled up every last delicious bite that we could muster. Definite return."}
{"text":"Delicious food, staff is always pleasant. I like craft beer and feel like they try to have a good selection of California craft beers on-hand. Haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"Fun outside patio. Super friendly staff. Clam chowder bread bowl is delicious! Ask for John...fun and attentive server!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for my fish taco, fried clam fix.  The fried clams are just so good, not all batter and its a big order.  I also ordered the fish sandwich this past visit.  It was HUGE! It can be shared with another person for sure.  The fish tacos, shrimp tacos are excellent and the staff is really nice.  Dining inside is sometimes hard because it is a small space, but worth the wait.  They have a nice patio with a fan and misting system, so its not to bad to sit outside.  They also serve alcohol, I tried the sangria but didnt care for it."}
{"text":"This was decent. Definitely not a good spot for taco tuesday.  The tacos were good,  the crab cakes tasted like hush puppies, and the food was overpriced. All and all, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a decently priced, and light lunch.  Fish tacos are very delicious.  This is a new favorite lunch spot and I can't wait to go when it cools down and sit on the large patio and have a cold beer."}
{"text":"It was a quaint little outdoor seating type restaurant, busy and luvrly- in downtwn Gilbert. I had the ceviche, it was good. Prices were decent and it was clean, but restaurant was tight inside and outdoor seating was loud with car noises since it back into parking lot. If you enjoy seafood it's good fare and variety but not fresh from the ocean type. It was clean and waiter was funny and flamboyant. I enjoyed hid funnies than the food and crowd for sure."}
{"text":"So as soon as we were greeted,  I guess I started getting a little annoyed.  We waited for about 25 mins and in that time frame another family waited to be seated and then a couple came in about 15 mins later waiting to be seated.  A server immediately asked if the couple wanted to order drinks,  but never asked our family or the other family. Boy did I get thirsty in that time frame! After we were seated, Haley greeted us pretty quickly & we received drinks pretty fast as well. She asked if we were ready to order which we weren't,  but then she didn't return for quite a while & we saw that it seemed she was taking a break with another server.  When she did return,  I specifically said that my husband & I would be getting an appetizer,  but to not hold up the kids food order. That didn't happen.  We got our appetizer, & then about 10 minutes later,  the rest of the food came out.  I also asked her to put my stepson's sauce on the side so he could try it & she said OK.  When we didn't get the sauce,  I asked her to bring it. I also told her I got the wrong fish taco, she replied,  \"you ordered the mahi\". I said \"yes,  but I wanted the beer battered\". Her next reply,  \"yeah,  but you just said mahi, not battered\". (Shouldn't that be her job to ask?  I mean,  she should know the menu better than me right? ) apparently it was my fault because she assumed I wanted them broiled. I also asked for the fish taco meal (2 tacos) and a Carne asada taco on the side. I received one of each. When I told her I didn't get the other fish and it was supposed to be battered, that's when the fish discussion happened. Oh & to top it off,  the kids menu specifically says it comes with mandarin oranges, not the canned pineapple they gave my daughter, but never mentioned they'd be substituting. She hates pineapple btw, but loves mandarins. The bill comes & we see she had charged us for the fish meal & a fish taco on the side.  Should have been a fish meal & a Carne asada taco.  That would have been the way I ordered it & the least expensive. She even charged us for the sauce that came with my stepson's taco but we asked to put on the side. She also charged for extra carne when my other stepson asked for half chicken half steak instead of one or the other. He didn't get extra meat! Just half of each, so why did we get charged extra?! By this point I was too irritated to complain again, so we just paid the bill and left.  On another note,  I feel it's very inappropriate for an employee/manager to smoke & drink on the premises, in front of patrons, when wearing the uniform (t-shirt with logo). And the guy who originally told us to sit down & when he got a table he would seat us, did just this. I believe another employee referred to him as Pablo. We gave this place a try,  but we won't be back.  Aside from the service, the food was just mediocre. The Carne asada tasted as if it had been cut from a roast beef & the rice tasted like it came from a box. The best part was the \"battered\" Mahi. (Ah Ha! I said it right this time!)"}
{"text":"I ordered battered mahi mahi taco plate with no beans just rice. Tacos were very tasty (or I should say the fish was flavorful) and the cotija cheese on top created this wonderful aroma. Cabbage was fresh and crispy. Their salsa was nothing but bland. Very few Taco joints take pride and go an extra mile by making great flavorful salsas. I had to get some chalula to make it spicy. Anyway I sat in the backyard patio. It was extremely hot that day but the huge shade with mist system made the heat go away. Long story short, a decent fish taco and I would like to try more stuff in the menu next time."}
{"text":"My family and I live just down the road in Gilbert and were super excited to see a new restaurant open up in down town Gilbert. We waited about a week after the location opened before stopping by to escape the \"grand opening\" rush.  We went in early on a Friday night - probably about 5:30 and we just beat the rush. We were immediately seated and offered drinks.  Now please not the seating in this location is pretty sparse unless you are willing to sit outside.  Nice patio seating, but in AZ in the summer I can't do it with young kiddos. Young servers that are nice, but inexperienced and it shows.

We placed our orders and started with the calamari appetizer - I love calamari - but this was kind of a let down. It was okay, but honestly Oregano's calamari is ten times better. So next up we ordered the kids fish and chips, my oldest had the garlic clam appetizer, hubby had the fish and chips and I had the fish tacos (don't recall which kind).  Everything was okay but not great, and portions were so so.  The clams were really good, but half weren't open so not a great deal for the money.  I was still hungry from our order so we decided to try the crab cakes to finish and this was by far the worst. They were gross and mushy with no texture - it kind of tasted like crab straight from the can - other than the crispy outside, no texture and no crab taste at all.

I was really hoping for a great new restaurant when we walked in - at this point I wouldn't return because it really was just OK."}
{"text":"My go to in Downtown Gilbert. The closest place I can find to \"the real deal\" and not being in Cali on the beach. Always fresh. Always good. And staff and ownership are always attentive alert and remember me. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, very Baja Cali style but so tasty. The beers were ehh and the servers were friendly. Just a little pretentious...just a little. But seriously who cares with food that great. I would go during the day next time Bc the restaurant is as dim as a Hollister store and doesn't feel that inviting. But I'll def go there again."}
{"text":"Great healthy prepared fish tacos . No greasy like Rubios. Portions are ideal. We will be revisiting this fine establishment soon."}
{"text":"Wowwwww! Enjoyed every single bite  Met my son for lunch, neither of us had ever been here before and so glad we decided to try this place out. I had the Corona battered Mahi and he had the broiled Shark tacos and clam chowder. If you haven't tried this place out, I HIGHLY recommend it! Trust me you wont be disappointed. Mario was our server and I'd like to give him a shout out because he was a great! Thank you Mario for the awesome service"}
{"text":"Great seafood and service! I dont leave reviews unless they justify my time. So Cal fits the bill. Good prices and nice ambience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to SoCal Fish last night.  We had a great experience from the friendly employees to the delicious food.  The decor is super fun and cool.  Everything looked clean and well maintained.  Our waitress Jackie was very helpful in helping us choose a beer and tacos.  We started with the best calamari fries we've ever had, tortilla soup and ceviche tacos.  The ceviche was so amazing! For dinner, we had lobster tacos, the special of the month, and the seared ahi tuna salad with the sesame dressing.  Both were exceptional!  We had such a great experience! The place was packed and everyone was hustling.  The patio had a bunch of heaters but I was chilly sitting inside as both the doors were open.  Just bring a sweater.  All in all, we can't wait to go back and bring our three kids or visitors when they are in town.  Wish this place was closer to our house, like in Chandler:)"}
{"text":"SoCal fish taco is absolutely delicious and reasonably priced! I also love being able to get Coronado Brewing beer here. The ceviche is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! It's small but very nice! Love it! First we ordered the calamari for an appetizer!!! Perfectly done and not chewy!! I ordered the mahi mahi tacos with mango salsa! Loved it! Rice and beans were good too! My husband ordered reg cod tacos and he said it was really good! My daughter got fish and chips and loved it! Overall this place was great! We will definitely be back and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'll be coming back to this place.  The menu has so many good choices. The inside seating is small but adequate for lunch. The outside back patio is pretty large for bigger groups. I had oysters on the half shell and fish & chips.  Both were fantastic. You should eat here. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the lighting. It's a little dim IMO but not something that will keep me from eating here."}
{"text":"This place definitely stands out among the menagerie of the Heritage District, which has given way to subpar food and terrible service/wait times. It's now my top choice for tacos in the area!

My mom and I came in on a slightly busy weekday evening and were promptly greeted and seated! Both of us were impressed by the fast and attentive service. Our food took no time at all and the portions were perfect. My mom got fish tacos and I the carne asada tacos. We were both very pleased and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Fish was a bit lack luster in flavor.  Cute place but the food did not impress us."}
{"text":"I had the two pc cod beer batter fish and chips. I dont usually buy beer battered fish. 

In my experience you usually get more batter than fish. However, at SoCal, the fish is lightly battered thus you can taste the fish which was pretty good. 

For $8.50 you get two reasonable pieces of fish and an average portion of fries. Another pc of fish and larger portion of fries would have push the rating to 5 stars.

I also had the New England style clam chowder which I liked. The chowder was just right. Not too thin and not too thick. You can actually taste the flavor of clams and not a bunch of salt, which many restaurants add to mask the flavor.

Another reason for the 4 stars; Indoor seating is very small. Feels like your sitting in narrow hallway with tables. They did have outdoor seating which we will try next time. 

Service was excellent and in a category by itself, deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decently priced seafood options and yummy tacos. The chips and salsa were good and pretty spicy, so take caution if you're not very good with spicy food. The calamari fries were good but wish there were more than 8 pieces. And it was nice having refills and drinks to take to-go. Downside would be just not enough room inside for seating."}
{"text":"The fish tacos here are incredible. The carnitas tacos are delicious as well. We got the ceviche to start which was just okay, but the tacos more than made up for it. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos!! Almost every me has been amazing. My hubbys swordfish wasn't too fresh tasting today but the mahi mahi, shrimp, and any other taco has been tasty. The shrimp ceviche tostadas are delish.

It's very small. But people are in and out. The staff is always really nice. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Gilbert for about 2 1/2 years and only last weekend finally decided to stop by instead of Joyride (and we love Joyride!).  So worth it.  So-Cal is a mom & pop shop, friendly staff, specializes in fish tacos (duh) with the most amazing clam chowder to taste!

There's a cozy outdoor patio with maybe 10 tables inside.  Definitely a perfect lunch spot!  I think they're looking into expanding their hours or having outdoor seating only when the new bars start popping out and hopefully more people will get the chance to taste the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Went twice. First time food was good. 2nd time, ordered Oysters again, Served on iceless tray with one piece of lemon and one piece of lime for a dozen oysters. Blackened grouper is really grouper with a spicy seasoning sprinkled after it is cooked. Maybe don't call it blackened. 

Both times, the service was terrible. Very long wait to take our order, then someone else delivers the food. The servers could use some training in order to keep things going. Both times, even though there was a 25 minute wait for tables, we waited over 15 minutes for someone to bring a check. Wishing them luck and will try again."}
{"text":"Amazing gourmet tacos at non-gourmet price. Great patio and service. Beer selection limited but cool breweries. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Crab cakes....fantastic! My only knocks at this place are that they do not have Guacamole (for things other than fish tacos) and that the scallops were a tad over cooked. BUT, I can look past this as the food, atmosphere and staff are awesome and overall this a great place to go! I recommend the Crab Cakes, shrimp tacos, chicken quesadilla with Baja sauce."}
{"text":"Food was very good and prepared from scratch. The calamari was outstanding   The batter was light and the sticks  were not something I had seen before. They were plump and the calamari was very very tender. Not a bit chewy. Wife had chicken tacos. She said they very good. They have a small selection of craft beers. Service was good. Will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cute, and overall a good location. I went here a couple days ago and ordered the cod with fries. The pricing seemed competitive, however, the food didn't wow me. It was alright though."}
{"text":"Really great tacos! The fish was really fresh tasting. Loved the sides. Service was excellent (Josh)! I loved sitting on the patio,  it was a wonderful atmosphere.  Sangria was delicious.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Sooooo GOOD! Mahi Maji tacos were flavorful with an abundance of tender meat and fresh veggies. The mango salsa was perfect. My friend loved her Tilapia tacos and calamari fries. Sauces and salsas were all very tasty. We came in close to closing but the waiter was still friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I run over her on \"Mom's not home\" nights... it's quick, clean and delicious.  He's training and feels no guilt on these dishes.

The patio is welcoming and lots of people interacting.  It may be a half block south of the center of the Heritage District, but it's worth it.  Parking is really easy too.

I suggest going all out on the burritos!"}
{"text":"This place was seriously awesome! I love the vibe of the joint and the tacos were great! I absolutely loved the pinto beans that came on the side also :)"}
{"text":"The food isn't good, the portions are small, and the niche they're trying to fill is just confusing. Figure a place with a name containing the words \"SoCal\" and \"tacos\" would be moderately Mexican? Rookie mistake. Don't believe me? They serve french fries, clam chowder, and fish n' chips. No salsa bar. Everything is really wheat-based, including their sides of bread. It's like some English or Italians immigrants moved to California and started calling everything they made Mexican because they felt like it. But it's not even decent. My french fries tasted more like oily potatoes. I finally had to stop eating in Gilbert. These people must be incredibly hungry all the time because virtually all the best rated Yelp places in Gilbert are awful."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating was very nice. Service excellent. The tacos were very good and so was the salmon wrap. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and super chill environment.  It's a very casual place, so they do serve your food on paper plates."}
{"text":"We have been coming to SoCal for a few years. It's a favorite in my house. Our favorite is the lobster tacos, I highly recommend these. The outdoor patio is large shaded. The only down fall is there is very limited indoor seating, so it's not the best place to visit in the middle of a hot summer day. But it's not too bad in the evening during summer as they have fans and shade on the patio."}
{"text":"After spending an extended period of time in Mexico, I was struggling to find a fish taco quality in Phoenix that was similiar to what I enjoyed South of the border. The Cod Fish Tacos at So Cal Taco were great !! After eating many Cod FT in the past, the quality of the fish they use is excellent, above par from other local FT places. The Baja Sauce they offer is good, however there was not enough on each taco for my liking. I ordered extra and they were great. The only negative comment I would have would be that they do not offer a spicy salsa. I used my own spicy salsa, which offsets the creamy Baja sauce they offer. So Cal Taco is a WINNER, but PLEASE get a Salsa option with some heat.
UPDATE - Determined they DO have a spicy salsa, however must be requested. This being discovered, SO CAL is THE place in the East Valley for Fish Tacos !!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I come here like twice a week. Love the Shrimp platter!"}
{"text":"So I was expecting the food to taste like any other fish shack in the valley. Boy was I wrong. We started out with the crab cakes. They had good flavor & a nice crunchy exterior. The cocktail sauce was the best part. I order the tamale del mar for my entrée. Folks, that dish is awesome. The seafood in it was cooked right. It was a perfect dish. My wife had the cod tacos. #amazing. Plenty of fish. It wasn't overwhelmed with batter or coleslaw. We also ordered the three street taco plate. Good, but not my favorite. Cole loved them. We sat outside and it was a beautiful night to have fish tacos, a cold beer & the love of my life. I'll definitely be back. This might be our new favorite hang out."}
{"text":"Calamari fries are phenomenal and the tacos, beans and rice are delicious.  Our server, Brittany, was attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and had excellent social skills.

The prices are a bargain in my opinion ($9 for two fish tacos with rice and beans).  The atmosphere is laid back and fun.  I think we found our new favorite place in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"3 stars for now. Went for lunch. Clam strips were awesome !  Lightly battered n crunchy. Cod tacos were a bit dry. Queso fresco was good but they needed more sauce. The place has a nice vibe. I'll try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent salsa (odd, right?) You definitely feel as if you are in southern cal at this spot. Staff is friendly and the food is moderately priced. Overall, one of the restaurants that will be in our rotation as a lunch spot"}
{"text":"Had a good dinner here tonight. First time here for dinner, and it had been a couple years since I was here for lunch one day. When you walk in, it feels like you are suppose to wait to be seated, but we waited and no one came. Apparently you seat yourself.

They seemed short staffed.

However, the food was really good and the atmosphere was awesome.

I'll definitely give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, but find myself in the area during times they're closed. They are closed ALL DAY Sundays. Finally, crossed this off my list, sovhere it goes...
I liked the food, loved the outdoor patio with a fireplace and lots heating lamps. The vibe is SoCal surfer and they have a decent drink menu. Missed Happy Hour, which I regret since a la carte tacos are just $1.50. Darn. 

Had oysters and they were fresh enough, liked that the horseradish had lots of kick. Mahi Mahi tacos were good. Rice was ok, kind of dry. I had a couple of petrified rice kernels that I bit into a few times, so I'm not sure if they're dried out from sitting all day, or what. The beans were great, stayed warm in the styrofoam cup throughout the entire meal. Ordered churros for dessert, and they were hot, soft-crunchy, and came with a caramel dipping sauce that was perfect. The churros stole the show! Try them!

Service here is friendly enough. My pet peeve at any restaurant is not having condiments at my table. I had to ask twice for hot sauce. A taco shop should automatically have hot sauce brought to the table, just like if you were at a burger joint, they bring ketchup out prior to your plate coming out. 

Ambiance, food, and service was good, but I think they have untapped potential to be great in the heart of Downtown Gilbert. And I really wish they were open Sundays. I'd give another star if they were! I struggled between a 3 or 4 star rating. 3.5/5 is more accurate, but I'm willing to go back and try this place again and I'll update my review prn."}
{"text":"It was ok. Ordered Olvera st. Tacos, tortillas were served cold. Clam chowder could have used a bit more clam and chowder little less soup."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot and once again the employees were total douche bags; We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Simple, neat food without trying to overdo the atmosphere. Tilapia tacos had a nice large filet, broiled, not breaded. One of our party reported these are better (and much less expensive) than other fish tacos nearby. Quick, clean service, great price!! Will definitely dine again."}
{"text":"Great servers... Very decent prices... Had clam chowder which was real treat... Fish and chips were pretty good... Would definitely come back.."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience! The first time I came in there me and the bf didn't know what to order we wanted fish tacos we told the waitress, so we order this combo plate. 5 mins later our waitress tells us there is happy hour at 6 and fish tacos are one dollar. um you couldnt of told us to wait five mins? The soup I ordered had something metal in it, actually swallowed it! A small Soda was $2.50 little much since half of it was ice. Every time after that that I came I never had a good experience; food took forever, bad bad customer service. I gave up on this place!!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in SoCal...not really.

Their alfresco seating in the back was perfect for this time of the year.  Indoors was a little cramped, but very nicely decorated.  Since fish tacos are their specialty, I had the blackened grouper topped with slaw and cotija cheese.  The fish could've used a little bit more flavor or spice.  I was happy with their corn tortilla which single handedly kept all of the fillings from spilling out.  The house made sangria was not bad.  Carne asada, as usual, for the hubby with ice cold Mission Ale.  He said it also needed a little bit more zing.   I also wanted to try the clam chowder.  Just little too much thickener for my taste with cornstarch or flour but the taste is there with chunks of clams.  My little cutie pie had the popcorn shrimp and fries he raved about.  The portion was pretty big for a kids meal ($5) that came with a drink,

So far, we enjoyed the food offered at such an awesome price.  I'm glad this one is not too far to frequent!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised with the food.  The shrimp tacos and blackened grouper tacos are delicious!   Their staff and the atmosphere is fantastic.    
We will be going back and taking others with us."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great tacos, super reasonable, and nice adult beverage selection. They have several craft beers, which is a nice touch for my main squeeze. The cod tacos are super yummy.. They have great happy hr deals too. Only crappy thing is that it's only offered Monday-Thursday. But, great little patio.. And every time I have been, the service was very laid back and friendly."}
{"text":"I am one positive person my husband and I received the worst service here ever. 1st they completely forgot to about us and 10 minutes later I found someone and informed them no one has come to our table. They looked completely lost and just did there looking at me. Till I said is someone going to serve us then they stood around looking dumb found and finally founded someone to serve us. They forgot to give us the complementary chips and salsa the food was OK deafly not worth the price. Then when it comes down for us to get our bill they give us the completely wrong bill to add the cherry on top and nobody said bye to us when we left. I would rate the food a 3 1/2 but the service was absolutely horrendous."}
{"text":"SoCal fish company specializes in fish tacos. The restaurant is small inside with seven or eight tables and is nicely decorated with a surfboard and  surfing pictures on the wall. The restaurant is sit down and I believe they may do more business if they had a counter you could order at -it may be quicker. But with that said I was in and out of there within 25 minutes. I ordered the Mahi fish tacos and they were excellently prepared. The fish was perfectly cooked and the tacos had cabbage and a mango salsa over the top. The tacos cost seven dollars and they came with a side of beans which had a nice spicy kick and rice - when you combined them it made a really nice side dish. The tacos were a nice size and it was a very satisfying lunch. I had a ice tea with my meal and the server refilled my ice tea and promptly cashed me out. Although the inside was relatively small there is a nice patio out back that has another 12 tables and also a nice comfy couch area to relax in and to eat your tacos - they also have a mister system out there to cool things off on the patio. I also saw that for dessert they have a delicious looking cookie ice cream sandwich that I will have to try next time. SoCal fish is a nice addition to downtown Gilbert and I will definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Really did not like this place.  

The atmosphere was good, and the decorations and simple menus were nice.  

The food itself was not that appetizing.  It was all very crisp and fresh.  However, it lacked flavor and was kind of bland.  Though I do have to admit this is good in away because it means the food isn't overloaded with salt or other unhealthy items.

I the mini tacos.  And they were wet.  So wet the tortillas were falling apart in my hand.  And I felt like a faucet was turned on, running down my arm, to my elbow, and onto the floor.

Needed to order extra stuff as they were also pretty small and unfulfilling."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's nearby, so my husband and I eat here every couple of weeks. Today I tried the shrimp bowl, which was super tasty, and my hubby had the salmon and shrimp wrap. I usually eat the lobster tacos, which keep me coming back. Kudos also to Baylee, who always ends up as our server. He's very knowledgeable about all the food and drink options, and is  always on top of things like drink refills or the check. We'll definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Very Fresh Fish Tacos, my kids also enjoyed the fish and chips and carne asada quesadilla. I love the California beer selection. It felt like being in San Diego again"}
{"text":"Ugh. I didn't want to do this but wow... disappointing. First off, service was GREAT! Food was blah. I ordered some (highly recommended by the server and host) new tacos locos.  They were supposed to have mahi, scallops and shrimp with peppers and other stuff in a wine reduction sauce. Hmmm... mostly.cabbage and one had a shrimp and the other had a small chunk of fish and a scallop the size of a pencil eraser. Literally. The two teaspoons of rice needed to cook for another half hour and the beans were bland. Oh and get this!!! I got a margarita and the bartender literally poured from a pre-mixed bottle --- $7 margarita that came from a $10 bottle from bashas. Husband enjoyed the clam chowder, kid #1 thought his quest quesadilla was \"ok\" but fries were hard and kid #2 thought the mac n cheese was horrible (and he eats anything). 
Did I mention the calamari fries are delightful? That's where the three stars came from... maybe should've been two."}
{"text":"We love that this place has come to our town. The fish and chips are yummy and my husband and son both love their fish tacos. And the crab cakes are wicked good! Relaxing patio out back away from the main street and they even have my fave Coronado Brewing Co. Orange Ave. wit. YAY!  We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"We were eager to try So-Cal, so last night was the night. Maybe we expected to much from a restaurant that says they \" want to give you food that you can get stoked about\". 

Ok, it started out good. We got the Oysters on the half shell and some of the Mission Brewery Hefeweizen. The Oysters were fresh and very tasty. The beer, cold and refreshing.

I ordered the mahi tacos, and my husband ordered the shrimp tacos. With each bite we kept saying to each other, is this it? We came here for this? We waited 30 minutes for this?  The tacos did not have much flavor. Tacos from Rubio's taste much better. The beans tasted as if they were out of a can, and whats with white rice with tacos? Is that what they do in So-Cal ?

Maybe the cooks were a little to much in a \"California State Of Mind\" last night, and forgot the seasonings on the fish."}
{"text":"This place rocks and I love everything about it! I am so excited to have something local and great food that saves me a drive to California! The tacos are awesome and they are so fresh and delicious. I think this place is better than the other similar restaurants in the surrounding area. It's a wonderful place that is kinda hard to get to but is worth it when you get great fish and chips which my toddler loves! I like the shrimp, pork, or chicken tacos. My husband loves the grouper, beef and pretty much everything on the menu! I haven't tried the calamari fries yet but I'm going to the next time we go. We go here at least once every month and would go more if we could. This place is our go to place when we are visiting relatives in Gilbert and any time we need a taco fix!"}
{"text":"This place is my new fav spot ! Everything was delish & my ill boys loved it too! Great atmosphere for everyone, very clean and friendly staff. Thx So.Cal fish Co. ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  I love seafood tacos and So-Cal offers some tasty options.  If you're not into seafood, the menu is limited, but still tasty.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Shark Tacos!!!! It's been so long since I had good shark!  The fresh mango chunks add a nice touch.  I'm definitely coming back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and sat outside. The misters cooled us slightly and felt good. Had fish ceviche as an app; a nice dish to share. The homemade sangria was very refreshing. My wife had the scallop tacos. Be aware they use bay scallops not sea scallops. I had tge seafood di mare tamale which was incredible. Each dish is served with a small side of rice, beans and salsa with chips. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The weather was perfect over the weekend, we decided to head over to downtown Gilbert for lunch.

This was my first time to So Cal Taco and it's not bad. Limited indoor seating the back outdoor patio seating was very appealing. They have heaters for the cooler weather and a couple TV's.

Casual and genuine. The menu is ample providing many choices. We are here for the tacos.

Service was friendly and pretty quick however, the kitchen seemed to be on the slow side.

We ordered the;
Cod, nothing special just good.
Blackened Grouper was overdone.
Lobster the batter was very salty and took everything away from it being Lobster.
Mai the better of the four ImO...
I wish the beans and rice was a larger serving. 

Price is a little on the higher side and you'd think the tacos would be on point!
Definitely will revisit to see if we can push the rating up."}
{"text":"A place I sought out for clam strips. It was excellent and reasonably priced. Has both inside seating and outside patio with heaters. Being from Seattle where clam strips are commonly deep fried, it was of the same quality and price."}
{"text":"Always great food and service.  Highly recommend So Cal for a taco and brew. Very friendly staff and comfortable environment I side or out. Love the outside patio feels like a awesome backyard."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and have always had good service and great food. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed and the margaritas are good!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  We ordered the fish ceviche, clam strips, cod tacos, and carnitas tacos.  A couple of beers and a sangria as well.  Park in the back and sit outside on the patio.  The service was consistent and above average.  We go to The Farmhouse, across the street, for breakfast all the time.  This place is family owned and has fresh seafood.  Where the hell else are you going to find that anywhere near Gilbert.  All of the food was very good.  We wanted to try a variety since it was our first visit.  The ceviche was tasty but if I'm being super picky it could use a little more seasoning.  I eat ceviche frequently in CA.  Bottomline, good service, good food, seafood from a local joint, and family owned. What more do we all need."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. We sat right away on the patio (we brought our 2 dogs). Service was great, tacos/beans/rice/salsa were all delicious.

Only slight disappointment was the ice cream cookie sandwich they offer for desert. They don't make them there but they look a lot better on the menu than they tasted.

Would recommend for the tacos !"}
{"text":"This place is great. We ate here and we felt like we were on vacation. The calamari fries are incredible."}
{"text":"Recent transplants to AZ and love old downtown Gilbert! We decided to try this place because it offered both seafood/Mexican & craft brews. I ordered the clam strips for an appetizer but they ended up arriving with our entrees. I'd have preferred them as a pre-entree food. They were tasty, though! My hubby ordered the swordfish tacos and I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were delicious! However, you get 2 tacos and the side is, eye-balling, 1/3 cup of rice and 1/3 cup beans in individual paper cups. While tasty, we both felt it was a bit over-priced for what you get in a surf-shack style environment. Because of that; I'm inclined to keep looking for the ultimate experience."}
{"text":"Who knew this little place was going to be this good? The food, quite inexpensive, is VERY good. I had some crab cakes that were as good as any I've had, even when in Baltimore or Boston. The fish tacos were to die for. We left feeling quite full, and the bill was less than $25 for all of us."}
{"text":"This place is cool.  Very laid back and relaxed. The lobster taco was quite good.  The patio is great for a spring or fall day.  The service was a bit \"laid back\" as well but very friendly and overall totally worth it if you are down here around lunch time."}
{"text":"We had been waiting for this place to open for a long time.  Were stoked to see it was open.  Went in on a Thursday night about 7pm and waited about 15 minutes.  It is super small inside, the outside is bigger but hey it's like 110 degrees outside!  They sat us outside but the misters were great.  I didn't mind it at all.  Everyone there seemed like they were enjoying themselves.  We got drinks from our waiter who was really nice.

That was the best thing about it.  We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  Our drinks were empty right away and stayed empty.  Then the misters went off...we still had no food after about 40 minutes.  The waiter was nice but he was just too busy to stay on top of all of the customers.  The food all came out at once, appetizers and entrees.  I asked for the misters to be turned back on as it was really hot...some of the other customers were also complaining.  They never came back on.  My fish and chips tasted frozen and everything was just about cold.  My husband said his Mahi tacos were very good.  We asked for more drinks and some sauces that never came.  We spent about 90 minutes there waiting and sweating.  The only positive was the Mahi tacos, so it definitely wasn't worth it.  BIG let down."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now -- being a member of Funktional Fitness, I pass this place daily running my Funk lap! LOL - and finally stopped in for lunch after my workout. I was not disappointed! The Mahi fish tacos were amazing!  Next I'll be trying the \"Funk Plate\" (not featured on the menu) -- fresh catch of the day and veggies. Excellent food at a great price! *****"}
{"text":"I hesitate to even review this place because I don't want the word to get out too much.  This is a hidden gem right on the main drag in downtown Gilbert.  The back patio is amazing, service is fantastic, and so is the happy hour deal.

The wife and I came in around 5 on a Saturday and sat outside with no trouble.  We drank beer and margaritas and tried every taco we could get our hands on.   Everything was superb, but the most memorable was the cod taco.  So well done.

This spot is getting into the regular rotation for sure, and we may even be back tonight.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The Beer batter mahi tacos are the bomb, and don't get me started on the tortilla soup yuuum! It's a laid back environment that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Maybe I missed something but this place just didn't wow me. It was around lunch time when we went and the place was almost empty. The set up was just awkward since it is such a small narrow space. We walked in from the parking lot and couldn't quite figure out where to go because there was no one around. The outside patio looked great but it was far too hot, maybe it'll be nicer in the cooler months(or month). The place has character, I'll give it that, but comes across as what an interior designer would consider coastal not quite a laid back beach taco place. We ordered a cheese tortilla with shrimp as an appetizer, it was delicious. The fish tacos were just okay. The mahi mahi taco was good but they were pretty bland with the tiniest amount of mango salsa. For a fish taco company I was expecting more, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I have gone multiple times, and each time I have had great service and food.  When family comes to town, we'll take them here and eat out on the patio.  We always start with oysters and then have nummy fish tacos.  Very chill atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place and it was just okay. Lobster tacos are my favorite thing to eat, like last supper on death row meal. The lobster tacos here were just okay. For $14 I was surprised how small they were. A little bigger then a street taco but not as big as a regular sized taco. I felt the lobster was over breaded so it got lost. The Baja sauce was nothing special. I have had much more flavorful Baja sauce on fish and lobster tacos elsewhere. The rice and beans with the meal were very good however. My son got the kids chicken and fries which was so disappointing. They were processed chicken nuggets. My daughter enjoyed the fried shrimp she got but we were surprised it didn't include tartar sauce of some kind. The outdoor atmosphere was really cool; very relaxing. Very clean bathrooms. We will come back but order something different."}
{"text":"Come here for taco Tuesday, even though they don't have any special pricing for you on Tacos on Tuesday.

I usually get the tacos Locos.
Definitely want to get some sort of seafood dish while you're here with the tacos.

Taco Loco has the sauteed Mahi, shrimp, and scallops. You only get two tacos. Which is definitely not enough if you're hungry. But it's pretty good, to where you might question yourself if you want to get another plate of two. But then you look at the prices and can't really justify it. 

The mahi, shrimp, and scallops are cooked pretty good. There is some flavor but you definitely need to use the salsa on the side to get that moisture. They do cut the pieces really tiny, so sometimes you do want to get a bigger chunk, but it's not there.

Comes with a side of rice and beans.

Price $9.5.

Service is really friendly and pretty quick.
They do have outdoor seating in the back. They have heaters for the cold weather. They will move it for you.
Some TVs playing sports game.

Also a cool fire pit if you want to chit chat around there.

E-Z Parking Lot access in the back.


Bottom line, expensive cost for tacos. Good tacos, but if you're hungry you won't be full. You will question your judgement if you want another plate. But you will think to yourself, for that price, you could get three more tacos elsewhere, but it probably won't be Seafood.

Also they serve alcohol here."}
{"text":"I knew I was hooked when I saw \"Cali\" in the title. Just ask for the suggested top fav tacos and you will enjoy all!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, although I felt a bit rushed out the door. The food was disappointing. The crab cakes were burned on the outside, although tasted fine on the inside. Glad I tried it, but next time I want crab cakes I'll go across the street to Postino."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place, but were quickly disappointed. The space inside is a TINY corridor, so your server constantly paces up and down alongside your table. The water is Gilbert tap water- blech! Any filter or RO would greatly improve the odor and taste of the water. 

I was still holding hope the fish tacos would save the day. Nope. Rubio's has better fish tacos and they're cheap on Tuesdays. I spent $8 on the Ahi Tacos, and could only stomach two bites. They cooked the heck out of the chunk of Ahi; either this was an accident or they don't use high-quality Ahi which can be served rare. It tasted like canned tuna, and there was hardly any sauce on the tortilla to add flavor. There was NO seasoning on the fish itself. To be fair, my date's Tilapia tacos were well-seasoned thin filets (they advertise a lemon pepper seasoning) and were enjoyable. 

They serve the tacos with a side of rice-a-roni, watery pinto beans and some super hot watery salsa. I love spicy food, and I could not consume this salsa. If you like pinto beans (undrained) from a can, you're in luck. 

We love fish tacos from The Reel Inn in CA, and we get that Gilbert is a long way from any beach. Still, if you're going to name you're restaurant \"So Cal Fish Taco Company,\" please deliver something remotely similar to what you advertise. I hope this restaurant can improve and offer some quality fish tacos to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here for date night /taco Tuesday. Absolutely the worst service! I'm leaving 2 stars because my food was good, but I can't say the same for my friends that joined us. It took almost an hour for our food to come out, drinks on the table we're empty, no refills, no service from the server to make sure we were okay waiting and no explanation as to what was taking so long. This story may be different/understandable for a packed house; however, 5 tables! We won't be returning. Take your business to Joyride. We ended up there after we left (5:30-8 for dinner at socal) walked into joyride got our food and margaritas left by 9 o'clock! don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"My husband was told great things about this Taco place so we decided to give it a try. It was very disappointing coming from someone that grew up in SoCal and has had some very Authentic Tacos. The sides were tasteless, and the portions were very small. It was expensive for the portions and my fish tacos were very salty. Unfortunately, I will not come to this place again. There are much better taco joints with better prices in the valley. Backyard Taco in Mesa and Santa Madre in Tempe are my go to for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Loved the outdoor seating.  Kids were happy.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ok, This is a follow up visit. We were here about a week ago, came back today for lunch, you know to see if first visit was a fluke........and it was no fluke. I had the same delicious Cod tacos, my wife had the fish and chips and we also had the crab cakes. I don't really care for anything but fish, so I tried the crab cakes, and boy, these were GREAT! My wife loved them too. She loved her fish, and I loved her fish as well, we share, and our server, she was so nice to us, we sat outside in the heat and it was very nice!. We are now going to be regular customers. I Give this place a big \"Woo Hoo\""}
{"text":"I love this place! Server Steele was cool! Mahi tacos were delicious.  Beer prices fantastic, $3.50 for an Ultra.  Arrived at 3:00, Saturday afternoon, got a table immediately.  Cup of Clam Chowder was good. Oysters were very small, but they did give us 7 on a 1/2 dozen order. 
My favorite fish tacos are at South Beach Bar and Grill, Ocean Beach San Diego... SoCal Fish Taco Co had Tacos just as tasty.
Wife and I will be Back."}
{"text":"Another great downtown Gilbert eatery.  Great clam chowder, decent beer selections and friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat, esp when weather is nice and we can eat on their patio. My favorite menu items are coconut shrimp and fish and chips (cooked a little longer). Service is always good."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time last night and all I can say is YUM! We shared the calmari fries and they were delicious, as was the aeoli that came with them (which says a lot because I don't usually like aeoli). The shark tacos were good. I loved the white sauce and mango salsa. My husband got the shrimp tacos and thoroughly enjoyed them as well. We definitely plan on coming back. I would highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We love this place! Servers are friendly, atmosphere is perfection, and food is delicious! I get fish tacos pretty much everywhere I can, and SoCal is definitely one of my favorites, hands down!"}
{"text":"Rude to customers.  Food is OK, but nothing to holler about.  I used to go to this guy's dad's restaurant, until they showed how rude they could be.  Thought this man was different, but his attitude towards customers seems to be the same.  If politeness, along with good food is what you are looking for, I don't recommend this joint."}
{"text":"My friend lives out in Gilbert and we decided to cruise around this area to find something to eat. As soon as I saw the fish tacos sign, I knew that's what I had to have. Their menu is filled with a refreshingly large number of seafood options and it was honestly difficult to not order several things for myself. I chose the shrimp tacos with rice and beans, and I was pleasantly surprised. The shrimp themselves had a ton of flavor. The rice and beans were so/so, but I could tell how fresh the shrimp were and I wish I had a chance to try something like ceviche."}
{"text":"First timers here today. I called ahead and asked if there was a happy hour, there was! I think he said 12-6 or something. Sweet.

Anywho, we looked over both menus. Both looked great! They offer tacos, sandwiches, wraps, salads, ceviche etc. 

They also have a decent craft beer selection and margaritas n wine/sangri. 

We opted to try the happy hour menu and it was perfect! It's a $5 happy hour menu. We got a basket of 3 tacos, your choice of meat. We got all fish. They're small but delicious! Great flavor on the fish! Typical items in it. 

We also got the ceviche tostadas. Two of em were decent size and packed with ceviche. It was all very fresh tasting. Something was a hair off about the lime juice though. Idk if it was bottled/concentrate or what but I just couldn't put my finger on what it was. All in all delicious and invigorating! 

Last dish we tried was the buffalo shrimp! Big pile and they were awesome! Not too spicy. Served with ranch. 
 
Topped it off with bucket of small Dos Equis for another $5 and we were set. 

$21 before tip for 3 appetizers and 3 small beers. 

Loved it."}
{"text":"The fish is good. The overall plate could be improved greatly. The tortillas need seasoning. The beans are bland. The rice is excellent. Serving in plastic baskets with plastic forks is lame."}
{"text":"I love this place! I found out about So-Cal Fish Taco Company from a friend of mine after discussing my experience at another one in the area. Wholey moley! I am so glad they had made the recommendation because it literally changed my life. 

Most importantly this is a local restaurant joint and it is so good every single time! 

My first visit was a little odd because I wasn't exactly sure whether we sat ourselves or had to be seated. I'm still not sure I understand how it works but I take a seat on the patio outside and it isn't long before a staff member will walk by and ask if I've been helped. 

The calamari fries? Bomb! I've had a few of their tacos and regardless of what I chose all I can say is BOMB BOMB BOMB! I heard a rumor that there is some tie to a fish market. I heard a rumor that the fish is fresh. I am not sure if these rumors are true but I can tell you that the fish tastes fresh and I believe that it came from the market or a market. 

The menu options are perfect in my opinion because there aren't too many to choose from that you can't decided but just enough to give options. They also have some pretty awesome beer selections. 

Unfortunately, I'm supposed to limit my amount of seafood due to a thyroid condition and so I can't eat here as often as I would like to. However, I would recommend this place to anyone to checkout and I bet upon the first visit, you'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty legit place. Between my wife and I, we got the mahi mahi beer battered fish tacos, crab cakes, shark tacos, and clam chowder. If you have a large party, get it to go. Not much room inside, but they have a great accommodating staff that will take care of you. The shark tacos were ok. It could have honestly been bass and I wouldn't have know they difference. The crab cakes were awesome. Flaky, tender, and perfectly seasoned. I'm from California off the coast and this clam chowder was some of the best I have ever had. The mahi mahi taco was legit too. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual place to hang out with a relaxing patio, this spot is it. Great prices and the fish tacos are yummy. So is the fish n chips and the ice cream sandwich for dessert. My daughter gives this place two thumbs up and she is not easy to please!"}
{"text":"Calamari was great, lobster taco was amazing and fish and chips were very good. Homemade cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and salsa all worth the trip alone.

Awesome local joint with awesome food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here its been good!, I wasn't a fan of fish tacos really, but now I am! I love the salmon wrap they have a good potrion of fish in them."}
{"text":"There are two taco places on Gilbert Rd in close proximity and in my opinion this is the better of the two.  It is a kick back place where you get a bottle of beer and some great fish tacos. 

Nothing fancy about it but it is some of the best fish tacos I've had locally. The mahi mahi tacos are my favorite and you have to try the clam chowder as well.  My sister drives all the way from Phoenix to get their food.

I noticed that they have happy hour and I haven't had a chance to try that yet but it is definitely on the list."}
{"text":"We couldnt wait to try this place, and weren't disappointed! Great location, wonderful decor, friendly staff and very tasty food.
Our first time, my husband had the corona battered fish and chips, and i had the mahi tacos with mango salsa. Both delicious. I'm a Brit and he's Irish, so it's hard for us to eat fish and chips out and not be disappointed, but theirs is very good.
We have been here 5 or 6 times now and will keep coming back. Owner is very friendly and accomodating. They even managed to seat us and 7 family members who were visiting from Ireland and had never tried any Mexican food (they all enjoyed it). I think I've had most every taco on the menu now and it's hard to pick a favourite, but the crispy cod tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst tacos on the planet. Shrimp tacos had no flavor.  Paid tab of $31 and I sent my food back. That was just for one lunch meal. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"For years I have been driving North to Mesa for my fried oysters fix. To my relief I discovered that the SoCal Fish Taco Co has fried oysters as well as an oyster Po Boy sandwich! I have been accustomed to the frozen two inchers that I get from the fish & chip joints. SoCal's are freshly breaded and 3\"-4\" long. And the flavor was incredibly delicious. The service was quick and thorough. Under a ten minute wait. Plastic silverware,napkins,lemons & tartar sauce included. I will definitely be back soon to try the Blackened Grouper Tacos and other menu items."}
{"text":"So... The fish is great. Crispy, fresh tasting and really yummy. The fries are good too. Our waitress was really attentive and overall I had a good experience. Unfortunately, all the other food is just not great. The tortillas were really basic and not even warmed up. The rice tasted old and I couldn't even eat it. They put cotija cheese on the tacos but they didn't put any on the beans (which would have been appreciated). I would have preferred black beans, but that's just a personal choice. The clam chowder wasn't bad but it wasn't something to rave about either. It's priced a bit high for what they offer and how they present it (think picnic style with plastic utensils and Styrofoam). Overall, not a bad experience. The outdoor space is really nice and, for the ambiance it's good. Everything else is just average, hence the rating."}
{"text":"FIVE STARS! I just moved to Gilbert from Boston. Was searching for a place that offered \"New England Clam Chowder and Fish N Chips. I must say, I'm AMAZED! The cod is flakey, the batter is crisp and the chowder is PERFECT!! Look no more! I've found my new favorite seafood"}
{"text":"The tacos are consistently good and the staff is always friendly and prompt. The chips and salsa are just ok and I wish they'd just serve on plates instead of creating so much garbage with each order. I would eat there more often if it weren't for all the paper, plastic and styrofoam."}
{"text":"What a cool find in old town Gilbert,AZ
Good priced taco combos with a great laid back patio in the back. This isn't a sports bar, but there are TVs.

Only suggestion is, add more Mexican beer options. 
Remember,  tacos is Mexican, you must have Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial and Tecate.

But overall. .. nice spot"}
{"text":"What a gem! First time here and will definitely be back! Fresh and tasty tacos and The service was great!"}
{"text":"I love SoCal! Fresh, affordable and one of my favorite places to go for lunch. Yummy chips and salsa and delicious fish tacos."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge 4 for chips and salsa, you might want to make sure  the chips are warm and not stale!!! I've ate here a few times now and I'm not that impressed"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be an order at the counter sort of place, but it ended up being a sit down restaurant.  We ordered the crab cakes, which didn't have that much flavor, although we did really like the tarter sauce that came with them.  My hubby and I loved the pinto beans that came with our beer battered fish and grilled shrimp tacos.  They are a little bit spicy and they have some crunch with the onion and green pepper.  Hubby also loved the rice.  It was moist and flavorful.  We weren't as impressed with the tacos.  I thought the beer batter would add flavor to the fish tacos, but the only thing with flavor was the cream sauce.  The shrimp in the shrimp tacos didn't have much seasoning at all.  If it wasn't for the sauces, the tacos would have totally fallen flat.  The service was great and our server was very friendly and attentive, but I doubt we'll be back because the food fell short."}
{"text":"I love going to So-Cal fish taco. The place is a bit small and there isn't a ton of seating available, but the food is really good and reasonably priced. I'm not a big fish eater but I do enjoy the fish tacos from here. I usually get steak though. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's a nice atmosphere, always kept clean / neat and its in a cool part of town. The staff is always helpful as well. I will continue to go to so-cal anytime my wife and I want some good tacos. Actually, now that I am writing this review, I am getting hungry just thinking about it. I might just stop in for some fish tacos today! Keep doing what you do so-cal. I will be back for sure. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because the dining area is so small. Otherwise, everything is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the patio here. Fun to sit outside & have a margarita & fish tacos. We've been a number of times & food & service has been consistently good. Easy to find parking behind as well."}
{"text":"We kept saying we wanted to try this place, but today, we finally did, and are we ever glad!  We were on the way home from an appointment, and stopped in for lunch.  We parked behind in the large lot, then as we walk through the back patio, even though it was 100 degrees plus, we decided to sit there since there were fans and misters.  We had the Peach/green tea, and calamari, then we had the SoCal and mahi tacos.  Had the mahi without breading.  Both came with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were fresh, but just so-so.  The tacos (2/serving) were the best we have had in a long time.  Very good service, also.  We will be going back!!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Great food and service. Staff was very friendly and prompt. They had a good selection of beers and a beautiful patio area to sit with friends and hang out. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is super simpático, we loved it.  The inside was quite cozy, four 4 tops and two 2 tops.  Plenty of seating outside ands while it was cold, they had a lot of patio heaters going.  Great use of space.

Hubby and I ordered 4 different plates to try and taste a bit of everything.  The calamari fries are way yummy, crispy and the squid is cooked perfectly.  The dipping sauces were very tasty.  The cod fish tacos were spot on, delicious balance of fish and condiments.
The low points were the mahi fish tacos and the clam chowder.  
The mahi was too delicate for the mango salsa. I could only taste the mango salsa in the fish, nothing more.  
The clam chowder must have been bottom of the pot as it was super salty and a bit gummy.  I am sure under other circumstances it would have been great."}
{"text":"Terrific Fish and chips in a casual atmosphere.  Will definitely be back!  We ate outside but also inside available"}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try So-Cal Fish Taco Company. Got there and it was a full house. My fiance had the shrimp burrito and I ordered fish n' chips. Waited 20 minutes for our order to arrive. Saw the basket and we both immediately said, \"really??\". Waited 20 minutes and portions in the basket was sad. Hook up the fries in the basket!! Good food but nothing extrodinary that makes me want to return to this restraunt. Along with that, I thought to myself, \"well it is a fish taco joint, I should at least try one of their fish tacos.\" From reading other reviews and talking to others, So-Cal Fish Taco Company is just another fancy place where over priced average fish taco are being served."}
{"text":"The environmental is fun and the scenery is cool, but it's pretty high priced for not ALOT of food. It was good food but way over priced for the size and portion."}
{"text":"Greatest mahi taco I've tasted. Never eating at Rubio's again. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. Wife got the shrimp and loved it."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. The staff was great but the food was awful. Had the beer battered mahi tacos and it was one strip of fried fish, tasted like it came from a microwave fish tray. The corn tortilla was very dry, sprinkled with a little bit of cabbage. The beans were cold and tasted like the canned ranch beans. The rice was also cold, still raw and flavorless. And the price we paid for them? Won't be going back here ever."}
{"text":"I would give them 4 stars even though the food took forever and we got the wrong order because the food was good. The mahi tacos, scallops and chips, and lobster tacos were delicious and affordable. Plus our waiter was nice even tho he made the order mistake. I would still come here again despite this experience."}
{"text":"Seriously good fish tacos!  Walked in at 7 on a Saturday night and was immediately seated.  2 adults, 1 kid, and 1 high chair.  SWEET!  Decor is awesome.  The patio has nice lighting so you're not sitting in the dark or barely able to see what you're eating.  After we were seated it did take about 7 mins for our server to notice us and get our drinks and since we had the extra time we also knew what we wanted to eat.  After that initial wait the service was great though.

On to the food!  Ordered Clam strips for an app. Super yummy.  A tad bit chewy, but the hubs and I didn't mind.  Got the kids' popcorn chicken and fish and chips at that time.  Both got the seal of approval from 2 picky eaters.  One minor thing was that the fries were pretty under done almost inedible.  I don't give them fries that much so we just ate the ones that were done and they couldn't even finish those.  Good sized kids portions even without the fries.  
Grown up meals:  We wanted to try a few items.  Got orders of shrimp tacos, ahi tuna tacos and blackened grouper tacos.  All of them were cooked to perfection!  Nothing was even close to being overcooked, seriously perfect.  While all the tacos were great the blackened grouper was the stand out by far.  The beans were also amazing.  Something as simple as pinto beans and SoCal made them memorable.  The rice was just meh, unfortunately got some uncooked grains in with the cooked, mmmm crunchy goodness, not so much.  The mango salsa was flavorful with a nice kick to it.  I don't know what the 1 star guy was talking about with everything being canned and bland.  The cocktail sauce was a bit ketchupy but that's about it.  Also got a Long Island Iced Tea, good but for $6 it was small at around 10 oz.  

Overall:  nice ambiance, small service and kitchen hiccups with it being new, the tacos are what matter and they are STELLAR!  Will definitely recommend to friends and family and be back frequently."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place! Today they were very unprepared for the lunch crowd!!  Never have I waited so long for service! Someone simply stopping by our dirty table, introducing themselves and letting us know it would be a few minutes was obviously too much to ask for. We walked out and walked across the street to Joyride Taco House where we were greeted with a smile, and impeccable service even though they have a packed house as well."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio area and we have always had good service.  Nice variety of Fish Tacos and their Shrimp Ceviche was very good didn't like their Margaritas so we now stick to beer."}
{"text":"It is what it is! Awesome! Food and service spot on. Too bad they are not closer to home....Maybe open up in Prescott?"}
{"text":"I have had the shrimp bowl and the tamale del mar. Both are incredible but the tamale is hands down my new GO TO! When we call for pick-up, both guys who have answered have both super friendly and knowledgeable with all the questions we had. Lunch is the best time to go because you can actually find a space inside. Outdoor area is nice but it's a bit hot during the summertime (they do have misters though). Parking in the back is easy to find when it's not Thurs-Saturday."}
{"text":"The review is pretty high here, but why the tacos we ordered didn't even hold together? We could not enjoy our food because it all fell apart after the first bite. Crab cakes were pretty good. Environment is good!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way into socal fish company and boy was I surprised.
The outside patio was inviting and the service was on point.
I had to try the oyster po boy which was very very tastey. The true oyster taste was excellent and at a reasonable 8.00
My fiance had a trio of tacos which were also good.
My only gripe would be the oh so standard frozen fries.
They are what they are......
It's time for a good frie folks.
Good experience.....i'll be back"}
{"text":"I always prefer the Mom and Pop shops to anything from a chain.  This place is a perfect example of the reason why:
1) Value: The prices here are more than fair.  We got out with our family of four for less than 35 bucks.
2) Quality:  The fish was all beyond fresh. The garnishes and tortillas were the same.  Very fresh and very tasty.
3) Service:  Casual and genuine.  The drinks never had a chance to get empty and the kids never had a chance to get bored waiting.  
4) Taste:  I personally had the mahi tacos.  Wow!  They were jammed with fish and the mango salsa paired with them was fantastic.  
This place is a must try.  Worth a drive if you aren't in the neighborhood.  My kind of food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his family were so excited to try this place out, but we all left completely unhappy.

For starters, once we sat down at a table it took what seemed like forever until we were waited on. Then when we finally place our food orders, it took way too long to come out to our table. Portion were extremely small, as if it came from the kids menu! When we asked for hot sauce, they brought out sriracha (claiming that was all they had), which is fine but considering it's a fish taco company they should have a variety of sauces/salsa for their foods! Then when someone else wanted more hot sauce, our waiter brought out Chulula! Which was really annoying because we were just told the only hot sauce they had was Sriracha. 

When we got our bill in the end we were even more disappointed to see that the each beer was overpriced and cost MORE than one order of our food! That's just ridiculous. Beer wasn't even good for being \"specialty\" from California.

Definitely wont be returning here again."}
{"text":"Tacos are great. Service is good. Price is a little on the higher side.  Cod and Mahi Mahi are the best tacos I had so far. Tried the lobster tacos and they were not as good as the other ones. 

Don't ask for water probably the worst tasting water in the state. Filtering or something not sure why. 

Baja sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Margaritas, good for happy hour. The prices on tacos for taco Tuesday are worth it! Service wasn't so friendly."}
{"text":"Tiny place, but nice. Food was great (minus the salad). Service was a little slow. I ended up getting up and refilling my own drink. The waitress had a piercing in her arm that looked infected- a little gross. Should have been covered up, especially around food.  but she was nice. We had mahi tacos and chicken tacos and a small Caesar salad. The salad was HORRIBLE!  It tasted like acidy Italian dressing- lettuce, crumbled cheese, and tortilla strips and WAY too much dressing.  We WILL definitely go back for the TACOS. Pass on the salad. We've eaten at lulu tacos down the way- WAY over priced and greasy and joyride across the street- WAY WAY overpriced and weird foo foo tree hugger type food. This place was definitely the best by far!!!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, we stopped here for an early dinner with our dog. The servers were very accommodating about having our dog with us which was important to us.

We were seated at the outside dining area. The whole place is very casual, but the food is exceptional! The food is served on paper plates!

We had the Tamale Del Mar which was excellent. The Steak Salad was fresh and the salsa ranch dressing was delicious. We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were quite good as well.

Lots of parking in the back. This is destined to be a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"My husband was craving fish & chips and being from SoCal, we decided to stop here for dinner with the kids.  It turned out to be a great idea.  We tried the calamari fries, chicken tortilla soup, clam chowder, fish & chips, shrimp & chips, and several different types of fish tacos.  Everything was delicious! We definitely felt like we were back in SoCal enjoying a meal by the beach.  The staff was helpful and friendly too.  It was extremely cold outside and the wait inside would be awhile, so they suggested we sit outside on the patio and they would turn on the heat lamps for us.  We weren't quite sure that sounded like a good idea but decided to give it a try.  It turned out great.  Not only did they move heat lamps to both sides of our table to make sure we were warm, but we had the whole patio to ourselves...and what a nice patio it was! We are excited to have found a great little spot not too far from home for the occasions when we are craving seafood."}
{"text":"The fish is good here and I like the outdoor patio area,  the atmosphere really  feels like you are in California!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food and the service was great- our waitress was super friendly. We would recommend the fish/seafood selections over the carne. The fish and chips were awesometotally recommend!"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive seafood in Gilbert, AZ??? What????  It's true.  This place is legit.  Try the fish tacos with shark,  Calimari Fries(yeah the thick cut calimari battered and fried) ,  Clam chowder,  Fish and chips.  Kind of weird you get beans and rice with some dishes.  Slaw with others. 

Seafood enchilada was not bad.  I don't drink but, buddy said there was good selection of beers.  He seemed to enjoy the two he tried. 

Good seafood for a reasonable price.   Didn't try any of the non-seafood stuff."}
{"text":"Went back for seconds today and had the mahi tacos. The fish was cooked well, the sauce was great, the salsa much improved, and the rice and beans are still very good. And they had take-out menus for the folks at work!"}
{"text":"Tuesday Taco Day !  Woo Hoo ! ! ! 
The Cod Tacos were very very tasty."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious So Cal food! Had come with the family - and the mahi mahi tacos were delicious!! And the place has a cool vibe...made me feel for the hour I was there that I'm chilling in a beach town rather than in the hot desert :) 
And service was super fast! Excellent when one is hungry :)"}
{"text":"The food was good the price for the caliber of food was definitely tied to the location .  Being that it's surrounded by old town Gilbert and tons of vintage spots it makes for a great pit stop .  But if you have a serious appetite don't expect to get full ."}
{"text":"So-Cal Fish Taco's are really good! My girlfriend ordered the shrimp taco platter, she got this based on our servers recommendation and she nailed it. My g/f thought they were some of the best she'd had. I ordered Cod tacos, the panko breading was very good, they were piping hot, and from the time we ordered the wait time was only about 5 minutes. My favorite part was the salsa, they really made the taco in my opinion. Very good and would recommend."}
{"text":"High expectations because of the laid back and chill atmosphere. Little seating inside, cool patio seating. Happy to see they serve cocktails and beer. I ordered crab cakes recommended by our server, they arrived in a bed of oil and luke warm in the center. They tasted like tuna from the Gordon smith guy at the local grocery store. I also ordered a Long Island ice tea, immediately I could tell by the color of the drink it was a mix or they had a first day bar keep.  I tasted it and it actually tasted like ice tea. The server asked if I wanted a substitute and I got a tasty bottled brew. Good looking out, props.  The food was mediocre at best. Hard rice and I swear canned ranch style beans. My date ordered carnitas, I ordered mahi tacos. We should of went to rubios.  

Pros...80's music, cool patio seating, prices, nice server.  

Cons...food, drinks, ugh!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had clam chowder, chicken tortilla soup, coconut shrimp, lobster tacos, ahi tacos, and sangria all of it was delicious! The inside was small but cute. The patio is bigger and inviting! Our server was fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this new taco shop in downtown Gilbert. The interior is small (maybe 8 tables) but there's a large patio in the back with plenty of misters and shade. I went around lunch time and was happy to see the place pretty much packed. In fact, I had to wait about 5 minutes to get an indoor table. We met the owner, who seemed like a cool guy- friendly and thankful for our business. His father owns a seafood market in Mesa so the food served his is super fresh and never frozen. The decor is surfer/beach with surfboards hanging on the walls and beach blue shades of paint splashed everywhere. 

The menu is simple with great options. Of course the specialty is tacos and, more specifically, fish tacos. My buddy ordered the fried cod tacos and I went with the chicken (they offer carnitas and steak as well). For $6 I got 3 good sized tacos loaded with a good portion of grilled chicken, cabbage, diced radish, onion, cilantro, and an avocado/garlic sauce. They were delicious and filling. You also got two small sides of rice and whole pinto beans (+ a small side of their house salsa for additional flavor). It's a great deal for the $6 and seems to be much cheaper than the rival taco house located further down the street (Joyride). I also ordered their chips & salsa, which were tasty and a good way to get started. You have to order this ($2) as they are not complimentary with the meal. My friend's fish tacos (2 of them) were large and full of fish. He liked them very much (he's already visited 7 or 8 times).

Overall, I would definitely come back for another visit. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They don't pester you but know right when to swing by for refills, check-ups, etc. 

Price, friendliness, high quality food, good drink options, and a great menu should take you to SoCal Fish Taco Company."}
{"text":"Visited So Cal Fish Company tonight. My husband and I asked our excellent waiter for a recommendation. We ordered the beer battered mahi and shrimp fish tacos as he suggested and we were blown away. So delicious. Hot and flaky fish was perfectly battered. The combination of sauces and accompaniments were perfectly paired here. We also were equally impressed by our appetizer- a platter of coconut shrimp. The batter was crispy and flavorful, while the shrimp was fresh and hot. Patio dining added to our experience. WE WILL DEFINITELY RETURN- YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open... So, the husband and I finally checked it out tonight. I will say that it wasn't horrible but wasn't GREAT! At first it started out wonderful, as everyone was pleasant and greeted us when we came in. Ordered our food, once again, no problems. 

We ordered some oysters as an app and they were delicious and tasted fresh. This is when the problems started...so our waiter brings our daughters food out and is like \"is there anything else?\" And we kind of look at him like \"yeah, our food..\" After a minute of the weird looks he is all \"your tacos....WILL BE RIGHT UP!\" And he made this face like \"oh shit, I forgot.\" So, we waited and waited and waited.... about  an additional 20 minutes while everyone who got here after us, got served their food before us. Word to the wise.. I am much cooler if you would have told us. We get it, you just opened, we would cut you some slack, if you gave us the chance. 

So, the sun is going down at this point and someone needs to tell them that when the sun starts to set YOU TURN OFF THE MISTERS. It gets cold and wet as opposed to nice like when the sun is up. I heard many people around us complaining about the misters, as well. Also, I don't know if there was some kind of mix up with the servers but we watched two different sets of people get totally forgot about at a table near us. The first couple just straight up left, while we had to sit and listen ( we saw more than one bus boy notice this situation... um hello DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT) to the second set of people complain about the poor service.

By now, we have just got our food and the tacos were good. I got the shrimp tacos and husband got mahi mahi tacos. Neither of us had any complaints about the food. My shrimps were large and cooked great. My daughter got the popcorn shrimp and that was actually really good, very pleasantly surprised. Next, we tried to pay and that took about about 10 minutes to get our check back after our waiter took our card...I don't get why that took so long!? Go run the card and come back.

So, all in all, the food was good. The service just needs some help. My husband said it best, they need an on-duty aware manager (which they did not appear to have) to make sure tables aren't forgot, turn off misters..etc. So..hopefully they see this and use it as constructive criticism because I really did like the ambiance and food..just with a few hitches. But, we will be back. I'm going to give it a few weeks and try again since the food was good."}
{"text":"My daughter and i came for lunch today. We parked in the back and walked through the open dining and inside dining on our way to the hostess station. We noticed five or six open tables on our way in. We were surprised to hear from the hostess that there was a 10-15 minute wait to be seated. 

(What? Can i just go sit down at one of the six open tables?) 

We waited and were seated within the promised window. We ordered calimari fries to start, with my daughter ordering fish and chips, and salmon tacos for myself.

The calimari fries came out hot, crispy, and were very tasty. We finished them off quickly. Both sauces were great.

Next delivered, were my daughters fish and chips, and some shrimp and chips that looked yummy, but were not what i ordered. The waiter promised a quick fix. I noticed the patrons at a neighboring table having bewildered looks, and no food on their table, despite being seated before us.

The salmon tacos arrived within five minutes. The fish was near perfectly cooked, the tortillas tender but not frail, overall very delicious. My daughters fish and chips were tasty, good crunch on the outside with tasty fish inside. Chips were reasonable, but not inspiring. The beans and rice that came with my meal were sufficient.

Waitstaff were nice enough, but maybe a little inexperienced, and slow at times. Their willingness to try makes it all good.

The dining experience overall was positive, but i don't know if i would drive any extra miles to dine here. If i happen to be close, ill probably drop in. (Ill bet that i would have given an extra star if there had not been a line with tables empty, and the wrong meal being delivered.)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had dinner and this place is perfect! Great service and friendly owner. Happy to celebrate 5th anniversary of this cool delicious restaurant. Highly recommend. Great price too."}
{"text":"YumYumYUM! I've been here twice in two weeks, and it's so yummy. Joyride Fish Taco is across the street and is good too, but way more expensive than this place. 

Great prices, many options, and awesome tacos.

The mahi mahi, grouper, and shrimp tacos all rock and are very flavorful. Tacos come with a small side of beans and rice and a salsa (I'm guessing homemade) that's spicy and awesome."}
{"text":"First time visiting, will maybe return. We came on a Tuesday at 5pm, and there were plenty of tables available. Our server was relatively prompt with our drink orders, but food took awhile to arrive to our table. We ordered a taco plate, scallops and chips, and oyster po'boy. Tacos and scallops were good. Would not recommend the sandwich. Three fried oysters on a dry generic French roll, with (shredded) lettuce, tomato, and pickle on the side. I would normally expect some sort of remoulade sauce or at the very least some mayo on the bun, but it was bone dry. There was a side of cocktail sauce, not a normal condiment for po'boys, but ok. I stole some tarter sauce from the scallop plate and it was palatable. The other entrees were good, only complaint was that the sides were on the small side (served in condiment cups, more like garnish than a dinner side). We were doing good until the end of the meal, when we heard our server telling the table next to us that Tuesday is buy one get one half off taco plates. When we finally flagged him to get our check (at this point had been waiting around 10-15 min for it) we asked him about the special and said it would have been nice to know about it BEFORE we ordered...he didn't catch on or apologize for the error. After waiting another 10 minutes for him to pick up the check and have him walk by our table without notice we resorted to taking it inside to have the card run (and another wait). In total, we spent just over an hour there with most of time spent waiting. Also, they only have 2 high chairs in the place and they are both broken, so not exactly kid-friendly. Disappointing because we like to support local businesses, hopefully if we decide to try again the service will be better."}
{"text":"So-Cal is so-so:(  cute little place with good service, however the food presented was not of fresh ingredients or bold flavor. 

I tried the crab cakes which were okay, not my preference to deep fry, I'm more familiar & love the Boston fancy way honey, cooked to perfection in a skillet. On to the Clam Chowder in a bread bowl, I was super excited to try but was way disappointed, not fresh whatsoever this was nasty porridge in bread, ouch.

Finally the 3 Taco plate \"Carne, Chicken & something else, forgot....oops. The Chicken Taco was old as if they re-served the chicken or had it had been there for awhile, I did mention this to our server that it was old, he did SMILE and say okay, silly boy was mesmerized by moi....or something.....lol

My final thoughts if it was a late night of  liquid poison, I would happily be back.....but since I don't....... Ciao"}
{"text":"The shark tacos were great. The slaw they put on the tacos is better than most baja mexican joints. I didn't like the ceviche. It wasn't bad, it just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Just returned from SoCal Fish Taco Co.  Very disappointing.  Decor and design was interesting, server good, but that's where it all ended.  Don't think much was made from scratch.  Everything tasted canned, salsa, weak cocktail sauce (more like regular ketchup) beans, tortillas......EVERYTHING.  

Really wanted to like this place.  No flavor/seasonings ... Boring.  Wish it was different.  Shrimp tacos and grouper tacos had no flavor at all.  Shrimp had watery/boiled texture.  Not worth it.  Missed opportunity for this company."}
{"text":"Food was terrific!  Service was fabulous.  Went for the first time and Ill definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We came here today because i was craving for some tacos. I like the chill patio. But it was too cold for me, I have to borrow my bf's jacket. Our server was nice, he keeps on checking on us. We ordered shrimp ceviche for appetizer.. My mouth exploded! It was really good. For the main coarse my bf got shrimp po'boy, It was ok i had better po'boy before at Flavor's of Luisiana. It came with a cocktail sauce, I wish it came with a tartar sauce. I got the mahi tacos, the fish needs a lil seasoning and it was kinda overcooked. The mango salsa was really good it complements the fish, cabbage and the cojita cheese. I was disappointed with my rice because it was cold and hard.. But we will definitely come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great the calamari fries are fantastic I could eat three orders by myself. The fish and chips is great I mean I haven't tried anything I haven't liked yes definitely a good place to eat in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is by far the best fish tacos I've ever had.  The flavor of the fish is so fresh! I had a salmon, shark and lastly a swordfish which were all amazing.  The inside is super clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. This is my new fish taco go to!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been several times now and it's becoming a favorite. On top of good food, the outdoor seating area is nice during the cooler months. I've tried the mahi and salmon tacos, the mahi is now my go to. The last two visits we split an ice cream sandwich lightly rolled in sea salt, wow! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was less than pleased but I gave it another chance. The second time sealed the deal of me not ever returning. They say they have margaritas yet don't have a liquor license which likely means their $9 marg is filled with sweet n sour mix and rice wine. Food was average and over priced. Service was slightly below average. There are better fish taco joints for the money that serve real booze too."}
{"text":"Such a casual yet trendy place in Gilbert downtown. I tried their lime margarita and it had the perfect zing and kick. Their cod tacos were fantastic and so was the seafood tamale. For dessert we had the churros and boy they were so damn good. Freshly made and crisp. The staff was very warm and welcoming too. Definitely would go back here. Perfect hangout spot!"}
{"text":"Great service, but the food was decent. We had the Mahi Mahi tacos, calamari fries and clam chowder. For a taco place the portions were small and expensive. Nice casual place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was impressed with the range of selections. We had clam strips, clam chowder, Mahi tacos and shrimp and chips. All were excellent. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Just had dinner on the back patio. It was simply terrific. It's a great chill vibe and great service. We tried a lot of the items. We had clam chowder, crab cakes, tacos, fish and chips, and ceviche.  I didn't try one thing I didn't like. It was understated deliciousness and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I give the homemade clam chowder a four out of five stars.....so good - Only thing missing is an ocean view!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, slightly on the pricey side, I would go back. Similar to Rubios; I had the beer battered Mahi (2) and two small sides: rice and beans. Cool outdoor patio, great service, excellent location. Not bad for a quick bite on a date."}
{"text":"Love the chicken tacos. Healthy but tasty, fun atmosphere. I am not a fish person, but my bf and bestie tell me the calamari fries and tacos with lobster, shrimp, mahi mahi are all awesomeness. 
Service is always good. Love the patio."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for to go food,  3 tacos meal.. Customer service is outstanding... meal is delicious!!!
Great food for the price even on a busy  Friday afternoon.   Keep up the good work SoCal"}
{"text":"We had seen an article in a local magazine about this place and decided to try it out last night for No Meat Friday.  The food looked great on the menu but was far from great when we got into it. The best word I can use to describe the food is Blah. The crab cakes were so-so. The chowder was a little bland. The cod tacos were bland and lacked anything special. The rice and beans were hard. The chips were over salted. Fish and chips were so-so. I would probably recommend this place for Happy Hour tacos since they are listed for $1, but aside from that try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco joint in Gilbert Heritage Square. Fish tacos.. On point. Shrimp tacos... On point. Lobster Tacos.. On point. Even their fish & chips & clam chowder is too die for. Honestly if I'm in the mood for seafood or tacos I alwaysssss go to SoCal. Their food lives up to the SoCal beach food crowd."}
{"text":"First time here today. Like seeing downtown Gilbert hopping. Hope it works for all of these places. Especially the locally owned ones. First off the guy who served me was very nice and attentive. Suggested I try both the cod and regular fish taco since I was wanting to try what they were known for. I liked the cod better actually. So glad he suggested both. Portions were average. It's a good quality fish taco. Quality above a rubios but not as good as Baja fish tacos. But close. Great atmosphere. Found out the owner was the one who helped me. Hope all his employees serve like that. Isn't that always the magic wand for places like this.   Go give this place a try and support local biz. Form your own opinion. But don't be a bitch. No one is perfect"}
{"text":"Skip this place and go to Joyride Taco just down the street. Fish taco needed salt, lemon, and extra sauce that they charged us for!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster tacos and they were fantastic!  Can't wait to come back to try so more of the menu."}
{"text":"So the other fancy taco place across the street is packed or you don't have that much cash in your wallet, what do you do? Walk across the street to So-Cal and get your fish or shrimp tacos here because although they are different, they are just as good in their own way. These fish tacos are your more traditional Wahoo's type and are great and easy on the bank account. They have a small inside eating area but larger outdoor patio with misters.

I have also had the shrimp ceviche which was actually a large portion. I could have that for a light dinner by itself! I am not a drinker so I cannot comment on the alcoholic offerings."}
{"text":"Finding a good fish taco in Phoenix is difficult, so when I saw a place with fish taco in its name, I was pretty excited.

The fish ceviche tostadas were pretty good, although a little flimsy.  The mahi fish tacos were ok.  They needed more sauce and to change tortillas.

Decent service, although our server did mess up what was on whose check.

I'll be back because I want to try more of their fish tacos.  This place has better fish tacos than most in Phoenix, but if it was in SoCal, I'm not sure I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I had heard from a few friends how good the tacos were here and I have to say we were very disappointed.  Were they the worst tacos ever? No.   Were they good? No.  For a family of 3 we spent nearly $100 for food that was mediocre at best.  On a side note, to top off the experience, there weren't even paper towels or an air dryer to dry your hands in the bathroom.  The basic fish taco is better and cheaper at Rubio's so save yourself some money and go there instead if you're looking for basic that's cheap.  Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"What to do on a typical work day Wednesday???? That's right, happy hour! SoCal fish tacos was perfect for a mid-week happy hour. They have $1 tacos and some tasty drinks! Check it out and sit on the back patio for a nice relaxing happy hour!"}
{"text":"I like the varieties of fish tacos they have here, especially for a pescatarian it means more options, lovely environment and the place is really cute, called in to make an order to pick up and it was very easy and fast, the staff are friendly too!"}
{"text":"Well apparently if you order food or drinks 10 min before happy hour ends...your out of luck. You see...per the Manager that was on duty(younger gal, glasses, brown hair, ponytail, very rude)...So Cal's clock on
the register is 10 min ahead. So...that's the customers problem why????? I was absolutely in shock. My husband and I brought our 2 friends that day to show them how great this place was and this happened.   Not like we all just rolled in at 5:55....we already were there for over an hour and ordered lots of food/drinks. Oh yea...also 6 mini Coronas turned into 5. Took 20 min to get the 6th Corona. Oh and...menu says 3 rolled tacos on HH...we were brought 2. Menu changed and we were never told. So Cal...you just lost 4 customers."}
{"text":"My husband I came here for the first time on a Wednesday evening around 7:30 and had an enjoyable dinner.  

We ordered the calamari fries based on other Yelp reviews, but I didn't think they were amazing - they were just good.  To be honest, they reminded me of frozen fish sticks that you were forced to eat as a kid.  However, the accompanying dipping sauces added that extra umpf and made them pretty tasty.  

We also had the beer battered lobster tacos, which were a special.  They were great! I would definitely get those again. 

Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  The outside patio area was very quaint and relaxing.  Another great Gilbert restaurant!! :)"}
{"text":"Gave this 4 star only because there were 4 or 5 wines on the menu but they only had Pinot Grigio or sangria.  Otherwise everything else was exceptional.  Our young lady server was very attentive.  The food tasted very fresh.  I had carne asada and carnitas tacos with rice.  Very good.  My wife had the beer battered mahi-mahi tacos with rice and beans which she also enjoyed.  Would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone.  We will go back and try some of their other dishes.  
P.S.  The happy hour wines for $4 were very generous pours."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are fresh and delicious, they are grilled so they have a lighter taste than the breaded and fried Mexican style fish tacos. The clam chowder is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not to good! We started off there for happy hour. Even though they have a happy hour menu posted they would not honor it.
Instead they said they are going through menu changes. They pushed their taco specials and come to find out they are not very special. I ordered their lobster taco plater. The waiter seem to be training another gal and said the lobster is from Honduras and it's really good. When I received my lobster platter there was two tacos on it a 2 ounce cup of beans and the two ounce cup of rice. Once I started eating the tacos I found out there was more better than lobster they should change the name to battered lobster tacos with a hint of lobster. My Wife ordered the mahi tacos and was pretty much just as disappointed as the lobster platter. Before we got our taco platters we ordered shrimp ceviche tostadas they came out and we were surprised to find that one medium-sized shrimp was split into pieces of about a quarter inch that were divided over the to toast autos and were piled high with lettuce. They should change the name of the shrimp ceviche tostadas to a lettuce ceviche tostada because paying nine bucks for something like that is a bit ridiculous. And now we got the bill we had a couple of beers each the lobster special and the taco special that they put on it was 16 bucks each. So our bill came to 60 bucks when the waiter was pushing the taco platter is on us  as it was Taco Tuesday so buy one get one half off we had to point that out to them and get our bill adjusted.  We are taco connoisseurs and this place is for amateurs. If you want a good taco go to Julia's on Warner and Country Club. SoCal tacos in Gilbert so long we  won't be back. We'll be surprised if you're open another year. Nothing happy about their happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here as an out of towner based on a recommendation from my cousin. It's kind of a small place but a cool décor, although it was so hot in there and not a single one of the ceiling fans were on.  One of the servers greeted and seated us right away and he was super nice. The server who actually served us, however, was so unpleasant.  The server's name on the receipt said Baylee and he had tattoos all down his arm. He hardly made eye contact, was walking away from me as I was speaking to him, and when I asked for a side of sauce, he returned without a word, slid it across the table, and walked away. Incredibly rude. The food was pretty decent but nothing extraordinary.  I got the cod tacos which were the perfect crispiness but were a little lacking in any kind of seasoning. It also comes with the smallest little sides of rice and beans I've ever seen. Not that great, I gave the majority of them to my boyfriend.  Overall not terrible, but not top notch in fish tacos. And the one server could use some lessons on customer service."}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh ingredients. Nice tartar sauce. Fish sandwich looked very good. Fish and chips were good, but not significantly  better than Long John Silver's or many other fish joints. My quest for a great fish and chips meal in the east valley will continue."}
{"text":"Glad I tried it, but they missed mark. Kinda explains why this is the one place in downtown Gilbert without a line out the door. Chips were stale, taco lacked flavor and the crab cakes were bread cakes with a touch of crab. On the positive, calamari fingers are worth trying."}
{"text":"Good was ok, a little too fried for me. Can get really pricey if your not at happy hour. But they do have a good happy hour with their oysters. It's probably the only place to get decent oysters downtown."}
{"text":"In town for a business trip. We were trying to decide between joyride tacos and SoCal fish taco company. Having never given SoCal a try we went that route. The tacos themselves were good but the accompanying and sides were less than stellar. The beans lacked flavor and salt. The rice came nothing close to resembling Spanish rice.  It was almost as if they had just made it with chicken broth. The restaurant was decorated nicely and had an overall California feel that was very inviting. The staff was friendly and attentive but did not make up for the food. Next time it is joy ride all the way."}
{"text":"The service was amazing but the food was mediocre. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and it was delicious besides the fact that there was a soup of butter at the bottom of the bucket. I love seafood but covering them in butter is a sorry excuse for taste, personally. I ordered the beer battered mahi tacos, which were delicious and filling. My boyfriend ordered the tamale entree and it was an average tamale, nothing special. Portions were great, but the taste of the food was nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is starting to grow on me. I love the back patio open air seating. The coconut shrimp is off the hook!"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I've only ever had the Cod Tacos but they were so good I came back 3 days in a row for more!  

The fish was crispy and perfectly sized to fill (not spill) the taco.  I'm pretty picky about tortillas but these had a nice texture (not the dry rubbery ones that come from that fish taco chain) and the cabbage / sauce was fresh and tasty.  I couldn't stop thinking about these tacos and had to go again... and again.  

The price was right, about 7 bucks for the two tacos and 2 sides - rice (which I liked and typically don't) and the beans (which I really liked).  

For me, the portion was perfect for lunch, just enough that I could barely poke it all into my smallish appetite but not so much that I had more than a bite or two left.

I called in my order all 3 times and it was ready in like 8 minutes, fresh and packaged really conveniently for a quick lunch in the car (parked, of course).

The décor is really modern, sleek and inviting - the patio looks amazing and I'd love to try sometime when I have more time.

Parking was ample in back, there is a large parking lot and that's where you enter."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this was going to be great Mexican food, even if it was seafood.  My wife and I had it for lunch and we were not impressed.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I was excited to try So Cal before they opened. It's around the corner from my office, and I love a good fish taco. 

I ordered the blackened grouper taco plate, and my mom ordered the ahi tuna taco plate. 

My tacos were good. The fish wasn't technically \"blackened\" but it was tender and had good flavor. The tortillas were soft and warm and held up to the taco filling. They put just the right amount of cabbage on the tacos. I really enjoyed the baja sauce and cotija cheese. The rice and beans are quite average, no special flavors pop out. They purely serve the purpose of completing the plate.

The ahi tuna in my mom's tacos was WAY overcooked, and had an unappetizing grey hue. It was not pleasant to chew because it was so dry. She mentioned that to the server and his response was \"Oh. Ok.\" and nothing else was done.

I will most likely be back, but not for the ahi tuna."}
{"text":"Best ceviche, best tacos, awesome outdoor patio, great shark tacos, great fish and chips! Only think wish they carried local beers and did bloody Mary's! Our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant for the first time since we live in the general area, it was very good and or service was excellent. Our server Avery was very attentive and stopped by many times to see how our food was and how we were doing. I really enjoyed the grilled mahi taco, it was very tasty. They have a really great happy hour menu, looking forward to trying it."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Portions are too small. Ordered the lobster tacos good quality just not enogh in the taco to fill you up (especially for 13 dollars) and the rice and beans are served in a sauce cup. Its like a sample. Definitely not enough food for the price."}
{"text":"Wait staff was very friendly and attentive! Lobster and Mahi tacos were amazing! Can't beat the prices either."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed going here for dinner.  I had fish tacos with rice and beans and the hubby had fish fry plate. We shared and it all tasted great. Good service too."}
{"text":"Good fish tacos but service was very slow.  They need to increase the size of their side of beans and rice.  They were served in condiment cups."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy this place.. open tables everywhere but couldn't be seated..?..  manager freaks out on the busser about seating ppl. harsh conversation about how the kitchen was going down... I left with my company from out of town embarrassed 8:10 pmTuesday he never once addressed any of the parties before or after us total chaos... I work in the area and you have lost my business for good."}
{"text":"Food tasted good.
Oysters were great, but no saltine crackers at all.
Hardly any shrimp on ceviche tostada and the nuttiest amount of fish possible on tacos.  That ruined it!"}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend after a bike ride,  there is both indoor and outdoor seating, outdoor seating has heaters just in case it's chilly out. This was a great spot for an afternon lunch.  We  started with a couple of good ipa's served by can with a chilled glass.  The shrimp ceviche tostada appetizer came with 2 tostadas, they were delicious, only thing I added was tapatio. We also enjoyed the mussles that came with bread slices for dipping into the buttery, garlic goodness and of course we had to try the tacos,  lobster, shrimp and mahi . The server was attentive, friendly and helpful in deciding what to try.  We will be back to try the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of fish tacos and a nice patio to enjoy when the weather is nice.  My daughter particularly liked the couches outside. I got to relax for hours, drink a couple of tasty beers, and enjoy some fish tacos...no complaints there. 

The fish tacos tasted like they were on white corn tortillas, so had a nice mild flavor. We tried the mahi, tilapia, and shrimp tacos. The shrimp were easily my daughter's favorite.  They were good tacos, but not the best I've tasted. 

Ultimately, I will be back, beer in one hand , fish taco in the other."}
{"text":"Good selection of sea food items. Nice selection of craft beers and wines to complement your meal. Clam chowder can be an entree if you are looking to go lite. Many items are deep fried so ask your server what is and isn't. Great service by Mario. Strange to see heaters on a patio in Arizona but they felt good for our afternoon meal."}
{"text":"We had my soon to be sister in laws bridal shower here. They bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of. It began to sprinkle and we were sitting in the lounge couch area out back which is uncovered. They quickly put up an easy up tent thingy and we were totally kept dry! Service was amazing, food was outstanding. I've been there a few times with a friend and loved the ombiance and food/service. I wanted to do the shower here because of the great experiences I'd had, now after Having been there in a larger group I am so completely amazed that they kept up to the high standard set in previous dates. Service and quality that is absolutely Above and beyond is usually hard to find. I love this place!! Oh yes and The shrimp tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"Very good. I thought $6.00 was high but it is a complete meal. They open a 11 am and I entered at 11:10 am and by 11:40 there we people waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Nice quaint location in downtown Gilbert. Limited indoor seating, has outdoor seating available, ample parking in public parking area behind the restaurant. 

Their menu is ample providing many choices. I tried their combo Mai and Blackened Grouper fish tacos, delicious and light fish, I wish the beans and rice was a larger serving. 

Overall good experience, great prices. Recommend highly if you like fish tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent prices and great food.  Had the cod tacos and chicken taquitos, finished off with a great handmade ice cream sandwich for dessert.  Great for lots of friends and families.  Sat out on the back patio under some umbrellas - middle of June in the Az and the umbrellas worked great.  Kids enjoyed it, finished their plates.  Loved this place!"}
{"text":"OK.  Some of you wonder \"So Warren, are there better fish taco's available?\"  Yes, most certainly.  Here's a photo of 2 tacos, each going for $1.75.  When I compare this to So-Cal, well, there is no comparison.  Yes, there are better fish tacos out there, and they certainly aren't in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.
I came her a few times last year and enjoyed the good foods/casual patio environment at a fair price.
Came here tonight and ordered a root beer float.
They were out of root beer so we asked for a doctor pepper float. Oh but they were out of ice cream too.
Came here to try the locos tacos but they couldn't make that. So my wife ordered the shark tacos. Wouldn't you know they we're out of shark.  They were also out of something else. The food was cold and everything kinda sucked. I wanted to walk out but i toughed it out and stayed...I should have walked out."}
{"text":"I have no idea why it took so damn long to come here! Grr on myself. Have driven by constantly on weekends and some weekdays when I'm close by, but never visited. I'm always at the Gilbert farmer's market & have visited Postinos with some gal pals, but have yearned to come here. Smack my forehead & say, \"You dummy, Lil!\" 

Totally and fantastically, awesome food! Took the fam out for a big lunch and wanted to check this place out, knowing that on a weekday during Fall Break it wasn't going to be busy...yet. Nice outdoor patio seating for lunch and it seats very nicely large groups (we have 6 in our family which includes a 19, 16yr & 11 yr old hungry boys). Service was excellent with our server being totally attentive and efficient. She was always there to check up on us in the midst of the growing lunch crowd, always filling up our drinks, and always being so cute & kind.
-Oysters were fresh & clean! Hubs & baby boy downed those in less than 5 mins; we should've ordered the dozen. It came with grated horseradish & cocktail sauce. 
-The clam chowder was creamy & loaded with nice-sized clams. An option would be to have it as a meal in a bread bowl, which will be for next visit.
- Calamari \"fries\" were cooked perfectly: light, not oily, crispy, and portion was good for an app for 2-3 peeps, not 6 (I got one, but let the kids have the rest). Would eat a whole order myself, but the main food is what I came for!
- Nice selection of fish tacos with choices of blackened, grilled, or beer-battered. Shark is also an option for the tacos - not sure if it would be Mako or Thresher...we'll have to see next time! Three of us ordered 1) grilled mahi-mahi with mango salsa, 2) blackened grouper, and 3) beer-battered cod. All approved and topped with Baja sauce & cojito cheese. Salsa on the side was tasty too. Tacos are served with pinto beans with peppers (didn't care for them) and Spanish rice (meh). A nice option or to kick it up a notch would be to omit those two items & replace them with black beans & lime and cilantro-style rice. That would be a more cohesive entree.
- Fish & chips...wow! Yummy, crispy goodness! The other 3 of us ordered that. Coleslaw was sweet which I prefer and the accompanying fries were seasoned. I think with 2 pieces of fish, fries & the coleslaw was proportioned well & filling.
- Other things to try for next time: clams & mussels apps, the Po' boy sammies, and salads. 
- A little pricey, more than what I'd spend in Cali when I go to similar establishments, but it was worth it to come, especially for fresh seafood like this out here in AZ.

Ready to go right back. I'm from Cali and the owners are too. It was nice to read their bio on one side of the menu, giving a nice & personable touch to their customers.This was the closest tasting thing that reminds me of home in all the years I've lived here - a laid back, mom & pops, outdoor, cool place to eat some fresh & fast cooking food. Seriously everything was so fresh, all we needed was a half dozen seagulls dive bombing around the tables, the salty air, and the sound of the waves. They also serve alcohol, a nice beer list too, but wasn't in the mood yesterday. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it.  Have heard good things from multiple people and finally made it over.  We sat outside, they have a nice area with bench tables, couches and tons of misters.  Our server was quick and attentive.  We had the batter d fish tacos and the shrimp tacos.  Each player comes with 2 tacos, rice and beens.  Very good food."}
{"text":"AWESOME! This eatery is a whole lot of delish! Fish tacos are some of the best I've had.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to SoCal for the 1st time tonight for date night and we loved it!  I had the Mahi Fish Tacos - I thought they were great.  Not too fishy, tasted fresh and the mango salsa and baja sauce was yummy!  My husband had the mussels, oysters on the half shell and crab cakes.  He was in heaven the whole time.  We aren't into specialty beers so we just had Coronas which is perfectly fine with us.  Loved the atmosphere and our waiter Ryan was super nice.  We already have plans to go back next Friday!"}
{"text":"Definitely you need to try the coconuts Shrimp . For parents with toddlers they have a kids menu for them too   amazing place nice service!!!"}
{"text":"Cute, cozy place. Our server was very helpful. They have a good selection of fish. I ordered the lobster taco special. They gave me the option of having it breaded or grilled. I tried grilled, and it was good. Like others have said it came with rice and beans. So with two tacos and the sides it was pretty filling. 

Overall it was good, but I probably won't go back. I love fish, but the baja/southern California fish tacos really aren't my favorite. Just personal preference."}
{"text":"My new FAVORITE restaurant! Thinking about the food makes my mouth salivate. Being that I was born in southern CA and have had fish tacos that are amazing, these ones have really become my favorite! Tried the mahi tacos and shrimp ceviche...delicious! I can't imagine anything not tasting like heaven from here! Well done!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok - I also ordered takeout but they didn't care how it was packed and everything fell out of he boxes.  Small place cute with a SoCal beach taco shack feel."}
{"text":"C and I stopped here on the way to his first performance in AYT production of My Son Pinocchio. The place is pretty cool. I love the patio out back that just oozes relaxation.
Our server was Dylan. He was totally on his game. Attentive when we needed him but didn't make us feel rushed or bothered. He engaged C about his car books / magazines and as far as I'm concerned, if a server gives my son the time of day, that server is way ahead of the game at our table. You wouldn't believe how many servers disregard C which is funny because he knows quite a lot about food. (gets it from his old man :0)
C & I started with an order of Calamari Fries ($9.00). C was excited to see this on the menu because he loves the Calamari at The Elephant Bar which cuts the Calamari into fries (strips) just like here. The Calamari Fries were cooked perfectly. Golden breading surrounding a tender strip of Calamari. Yummy. The negative here was the portion size, for 9 bucks, could have been a bit larger.
C ordered the Cheese Crisp (HH $5.00) which was actually a Quesadilla. It was quite large for the money. Great deal. C loved it. The tortilla was nicely browned in spots, the cheese was oowey gooey goodness.  Winner winner cheese crisp dinner.
I ordered the Carnitas Tacos ($7.50). These tacos (3) were decent little tacos. They put down double corn tortillas and top them with the yummy pork, shredded lettuce, cheese & cilantro. On the side was Spanish rice, beans and some tasty salsa. The pork was tender and very flavorful. My only complaint would be that the kitchen needs to drain the pork for a few more seconds. On my tacos the pork was so wet it made the top tortilla unusable. Not that big of a deal.
C & I both had lemonade ($2.50 ea)
Great service, reasonable prices, clean groovy dining space & patio, great Calamari, great Cheese Crisp, great Port Tacos. 4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"The interior looks a little like a rubios but it was actually so much nicer. We got here at 11 on a weekday and it was packed within 30 minutes.  The server was perfect - friendly but not intrusive. 

The food came out piping hot. We had the calamari fries. They were bigger strips but tender and flavorful. I really liked the aoli. 

Also had the scallops and chips. Felt a little overcooked but still tender inside. Did not care for the fries, they were bland and boring. The tacos looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a year or so... Six months ago they would of received 5 stars but I feel the food quality has gone downhill slightly. I have always ordered the cod tacos & the tortilla soup (the soup is amazing) the last 3/4 times the tacos have been overcooked & hard... I will continue to come & hopefully they will get better Also I wish they were open on Sundays, they would get tons of business."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for the best Fish Tacos. I always sit on the patio and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing!

I've lived here 8.5 years, and I'm sad it took me so long to eat at this gem. I've eaten there nearly once a week since my first visit 6 weeks ago. 

To be fair, being from the Gulf area, I'm always leery of seafood places here in AZ. Let me put your mind at ease: the seafood here is so good! I don't know where they get it from or how they get it here, but they do a fantastic job. 

My first time, I tried the Tacos Locos and they are so delicious, (a burst of complementary flavors dancing on your tastebuds) I haven't changed my order. I have shared the ceviche with my husband which I would also recommend. 

My husband has had the grouper and shark tacos, both which he has raved about. My friend who accompanied me on one visit ate the fish and chips. He was very satisfied. I would recommend eating non fried fish at this place, though, because it's so great. 

The service has always been good at each of my visits. The place is small, so I recommend going at non-peak times."}
{"text":"Our first time at this brand new restaurant and I am please to say it was a first class experience.

We visited for lunch just a couple of days after opening so expected them to still be working things out but everything went smoothly. As a Brit I had to go with their $6 Fish & Chips. For that price I expected a smaller portion but the two pieces of fish were a decent size and it was more than enough for lunch. The fish was tasty and the batter cooked perfectly. Served with Tartar sauce and lemon, these guys understand how to cook my national dish (they even had malt vinegar for the chips ... bloody marvelous!).

My lunch companion enjoyed two 'delicious' fish tacos and also said it was the right amount for lunch. 

Well priced, friendly service and a very cool look to the restaurant makes SoCal Fish Company a place I will be returning to again."}
{"text":"I was a regular for a while and moved to far.  I brought my friend. It was so awkward because the first half of our visit all the employees were so loud during our visit. It was not pleasant. Please be more professional."}
{"text":"Both my husband and I had SoCal bookmarked for a while so last Saturday we stopped in for lunch. My husband ordered the beer battered fish tacos (Cod, I believe) and I ordered clam strips with a cup of New England clam chowder. My food was great but my husband's tacos were just so-so, they definitely needed more sauce to add some flavor but the fry on the fish was so crispy.  What left a bad taste in my mouth was the owner. He was not friendly or welcoming whatsoever. I'm not saying you HAVE to be friendly but when we walked in, he didn't greet us, and when we left he didn't even acknowledge us, not a \"thanks for coming\" or a \"how was the food, guys?\" He definitely looked at us though. I'm not chatty by any means so I wouldn't have wanted to make small talk but personally, I like being made to feel welcome when patronizing a business. I asked my husband if it was just me who felt that way but he said he got a weird vibe too.  First and last time at SoCal, for sure, but giving three stars because I did enjoy my food and our waitress was super attentive and kept our drinks filled at all times."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and everything was good.  I had the blackened grouper tacos and my girlfriend had the shrimp tacos.  Both were excellent but I lean towards the grouper.  The spicy kick added with the salsa was awesome.  Even the small sides of beans and rice were good.  Very friendly staff, quick service and reasonable price for lunch.  Highly recommend this new downtown Gilbert addition."}
{"text":"The tacos were okay.... My beer was barely cold, I had a burgundy colored hair wrapped around my mahi mahi taco which really made me sick. Any good restraunt would have just taken it off the bill. But nope. They discounted it 5$... I had to wait to eat while they remade my taco. The mahi , cod and sword fish -they taste exactly the same so save a few bucks and just get the cod. Lol  I like trying new places but I probably won't ever come here again. Don't waste your money-- del tacos fish tacos taste better"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Our server, nice young lady, was very helpful. Our January 10, 2015 dining experience was compromised, however, by a different young male server, believe his name was Josh, who couldn't get away from a table of HIS friends using junior high-level language/humor and talking excessively loud about pretty much nothing."}
{"text":"Love the downtown Gilbert area and happy this place opened. Love the decor and the service was good. Very laid back, plastic and paper kinda place. The clam chowder was not as anticipated, wish it had more clams but the shrimp tacos were good. I liked the Cotija cheese and Baja sauce on it. The cheese had a feta taste which give it a little edge. My friend had the fish & chips and said it was very fresh. The Left Coast amber beer was pretty good too."}
{"text":"What a chill place with a nice patio and fresh shrimp tacos! If you close your eyes you almost feel like you're at the beach-I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu..."}
{"text":"Service is a bit spotty, but the tacos are delicious! Took almost 45 mins to get seated the first time and seated immediately the second time.

 To be honest I'm not typically a fan of fish tacos. I like seafood I like tacos. Not thrilled with them together. When I had my first bite of fish taco here my initially reaction was \"not sure if just really hungry or best fish taco I've ever had!\" (After the first 45 min wait). Went back yesterday and confirmed yeah probably best fish taco ever."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Fresh fish tacos in Az. hard to come by."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It may be tiny but the patio is amazing. The food was astoundingly good. I wished I could eat more. I love the selection for the tacos and the fact that you can mix and match. I had the Shrimp and the Cod. I preferred the shrimp but I see why the Cod is a big seller. Our server was super sweet and helpful. I can't wait to go back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great homemade chips and salsa.  Fish and Chips, Chicken Tacos and Fish Tacos are what I have tried and all were very good.  The inside is small and there could be a long wait, especially during the summer months here in Arizona.  However, they have a great patio section and now that it is cooling off, I would choose to sit outside.  Definitely reccomend.  The owner and staff are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert has exploded with restaurant options over the past year or so. Most are amazing, there's no doubt about that. SoCal is no exception. We've be there dozens of times, and SoCal continues to be our go-to spot on Friday nights!"}
{"text":"I ate here last Saturday with the Fam bam. We all walked out raving about the food and what we were going to eat next time! I had the oyster po boy..yumm"}
{"text":"Pretty good... Not as good as \"Wahoos\" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips."}
{"text":"Shrimp tamale. OMFG. My friend asked why I kept moaning, lol. I wasn't even embarrassed. That was hands down the BEST entree ever. I brought one home for my son to try and all I heard was \"Aw man. Oh wow.\" and the fork scraping the plate. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice or beans, but that tamale and the cup of clam chowder were on point...Oh yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Why didn't I know about this place?? My Daughter and I decided to check it out when we had a rare night to ourselves and so glad we did! We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were just delicious and could have been a meal in themselves. The waitress said the magic \"L\" word(lobster) as a special so I had the lobster tacos. Yummy yummy yummy! Prices are reasonable and I like that the patio is in back, not out on busy Gilbert Road. We will definitely be there again and again!!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place has that many stars. The food was not even close to saying it was good. I guess if it was the only food left, of course I'd eat it. Let's start w the crab cakes, no flavor. Had a slight crisp to it, thick but no flavor. Ordered a side of aioli to give it flavor. The mussels, the sauce was so salty. The side pieces of bread were just slices of bread, not even toasted. DO NOT ORDER THE SHRIMP PO BOY. All it is, is fried shrimp in a big roll of bread. THATS IT. No sauce whatsoever. If you've had a true Po boy as I have (Louisiana) then you will be so disappointed. Seriously they should state in the menu \"fried shrimp in a big roll of bread. Dry as heck\". My buddy got the shrimp tacos, no flavor. I don't know if the people who reviewed this place only come from AZ where seafood is not great because true seafood lovers would know the difference. Place is gross. I guess the idea and outside set up is cool (inside was super small and diner ish) service was good though, so keep that up! Never returning. Ever."}
{"text":"Food is priced well, and not bad, but this place is sketchy. You can hear managers yelling at servers, and speaking very unprofessionally. Also, they have received numerous health code violations..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! last week i had the Halibut fish and chips and it was perfecto!! yummmm! I also love their shrimp and chips!"}
{"text":"I think the atmosphere was good. I think I ordered poorly. I got the fish cerveche and my husband got the coconut shrimp. We also got some calamari fries. I should've got something hot and a meal. Our three things were $30. Service was ok but not real into making it more than putting our food order in. I probably would go elsewhere for tacos."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the service I received from my server I would give this place 5 stars. The busboy on the other hand was phenomenal I gave him the tip. 

But I will be back the food was sooooo yummy. I had the scallop tacos and my daughter had the salmon wrap. So good!!!!!!! My other two had the popcorn chicken on the kids menu it tasted like frozen chicken and fries. But that's expected it's a fish place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for quick, affordable good food! The staff is always friendly and helpful, and Pablo the owner is usually there and does whatever he can to make sure all his customers enjoy their experience. The shrimp ceviche and the clam chowder are two of my favorites, especially if I'm in a rush and need to get in and out."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love SoCal Fish Taco Company. My favorite tacos are the grilled Mahi Mahi. Have also has the cod tacos and calamari fries - also both very good. Price is right, location is great in downtown Gilbert and the staff is friendly. They have a few SoCal craft beers to choose from - really like the Coronado Brewing IPA. 

There are several fish taco shops we like in San Diego, SoCal Fish Taco company is bringing those great tacos to Gilbert. Great work guys, keep it up."}
