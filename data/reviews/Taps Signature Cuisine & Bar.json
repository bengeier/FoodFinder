{"text":"Taps is a neighborhood-friendly beer and wine bar.    The 10-12 beers on tap are a great balanced selection - domestic, excellent Arizona micro's, and top notch imports.  The wine list reads like the \"Best Buy list under $20\" in a wine magazine.  Which is really not a bad thing. The food is - well, its bar food.  The 2 standouts - \"air-fried\" New York style wings.  They are cooked by a special high temperature high air velocity convection oven so no grease at all, quite lean and crispy.  Second, the brewed beef and French dip sandwiches. Succulent, well spiced, tender melt in your mouth beef.  The rest of the menu - just average at best.  Avoid the Costco-burgers - grill cooked to a pasty grey tasteless waste of time. The atmosphere is casual by both the employees and customers- almost like the owners and managers are more about the idea of being bar owners and bar managers than being self aware about the business itself. The staff is friendly, like going to your neighbors for a backyard cookout, and the service is pretty much the same level.  You get the idea that the waiters-staff have little or no professional restaurant experience or skills, but one feels bad about not letting it go because they are just so like your own neighbors.  They do have entertainment, some pretty good, some not so good.  A duet called Copper Skies plays all the late 60s and 70s folk-pop ballads - pretty good.  A 3-boy teen-aged band played very very badly, like the Jonas brothers without any skills age 12-15.  It was enough to drive us away from those great beer taps and out the door. Yet some of the customers loved them, just as if your neighbors 3 sons played for you at their backyard barbecue.  So have some patience, converse with those next to you while you are waiting on the service, order a beer or two, enjoy some spicy wings, and relax."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I'd want to stumble across if I were visiting this city. It feels like a local gem, with great atmosphere and a casual but warm-seeming crowd. The service was okay, The service is attentive and very personable.

That said, those qualities are enough for me to overlook some not-as-stellar things. I didn't like the flavor combination of the tomato soup. There weren't any real overarching element to bring the ingredients together.

I also tried the CRABbread pizza, and though the crust was amazing, the crab meat (and whatever other ingredients were on that pizza) were lost among a mass of very oily onions.

The wine is very reasonably priced here....you can get bottles for $15.

So if Taps, you can dial back the oil, and let your super fresh ingredients shine through more on their own, this would definitely be five stars in my book."}
{"text":"Me and my husband ate there on January 4th around 7pm we ordered the pizza bread and it was cold the cheese was not melted and then I ordered the prime rib dip, the au jus was more like watered olive oil and tasted horrible. My husband ordered the blu burger and the patty fell apart in pieces and it was very very rare when my husband ordered it well. As a fellow server and manager of the restaurant business the food we got would make us not want to return please make sure you're kitchen staff pays more attention to the food it's 85 percent of the experience. The first time we went there it was so good even though we had to wait and hour because the poor bar tender was the only one tending to the restaurant since your server called in sick."}
{"text":"Horrible service...and quite a dump considering the outside looked nice.  And, the loud country music was NOT a plus either.  A friend met us there and was there about 15 minutes before us and wasn't even acknowledged as she sat there alone.  We were all extremely disappointed as they did NOT HONOR our groupon for wine tasting/cheese plate!  We had called that morning and was told that no reservations were needed (I could see why after walking in...it was dead on Saturday night...maybe 8 people in the entire place).  So, we show up and the waitress (a complete dingbat!) had no clue and said she had to ask the (LAZY) kitchen if \"they had what was required\".  REALLY?!?How hard is it to open a couple bottles of wine and cut up some cheese??  The waitress came back and said that \"since we didn't have reservations, they didn't have what was needed\".  SERIOUSLY?!?  WOW!  So, naturally, we asked to see the manager and he/she was conveniently \"running errand\" (this was at 8:30 at night).  So, PLEASE do NOT go to this place.  This place shouldn't be allowed to be open if they are going to hire such idiots!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Taps not only for the food, but for the entertainment as well. I don't know of many places to go in the West Valley that can offer this mix. My favorite entree is the Thai Green Curry Chicken ordered up extra spicy.  They have a nice selection of wines and craft beers as well. The live entertainment is what I like best of all. They mix it up with different bands and even a DJ if you're in the mood for dancing."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good.

The food is very good, and the service is very tentative.

Now the bad.

The prices are way WAY to expensive for the area. There is a plethora of other dining locations in the immediate area, at half the price. I mean really, $4 for a long neck!? $9 for a captain and coke!? Go to Applebee's across the street and get a beer for half the price. I know the owners have other locations in Peoria and Litchfield. Those areas I would understand the pricing, however this is a blue collar area and that is unacceptable. If everything were lowered by $1 or $2 this place would be packed. Unfortunate for the business that only two days after opening the place was a ghost town, and continues to be. Management needs a reality check."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this location. I want to like it. I really, really do. But it seems that every other time I go in to Taps, I have a really bad experience.

The food is okay. I love food and I'm able to find quite a few things on the menu that I want to eat. And I really love their beer battered fries in their smokey cheddar cheese sauce. They rock. However, the price of the food is about $2 more than I'd like to pay for that style of food. It's nothing special, so I'm surprised about the \"special\" prices.

Additionally, the service leaves a lot to be desired. One time I had good service there. The other times I was ignored by bartenders and servers alike, even though they were all standing behind the bar chatting, with no other customers in the restaurant. The last time I went to this restaurant, I saw two bartenders and a server behind the bar, two other servers working the outside patio, and one server working the main floor indoors. And since I was sitting indoors, this meant I got no service for 7 minutes while I was told to \"grab a seat wherever [I'd] like.\" And then when the server did arrive, she just dropped off menus and walked away, without taking my drink order. We got up and left soon after that. I wonder if they even noticed we were gone. Each server seems to have an attitude problem as well, which doesn't bode well for quality service, and it definitely won't get them a quality tip.

Also, the vibe is seriously weird. It conflicts with itself in too many ways. The name \"Taps\" seems to portray a beer bar, probably with many craft beers on tap, right? Wrong. They've got about 12 or so. They also have a bizarre \"wine bar\" area in the back, which people can rent out  for wine tasting parties. But their wine selection isn't that good. Also, wine doesn't flow from a tap, so I'm not sure how that all fits in. Their waitresses wear awful tennis-style uniforms with their bottoms and their tops hanging out, which would almost make sense in a sports bar. However, this place isn't set up like a sports bar in the slightest. They also sometimes have live musicians play on weekends, which is a nice thought, but the set up is so acoustically-challenged that the music is much too loud and diners can't enjoy their meals with their meal companions.

All in all, I can't imagine that I'll be going back to this bar again. There are too many things about it that give me the creeps, including the fact that the owner is a slimeball who pats people on the butts and walks around without shoes on. Seriously."}
{"text":"Nice bar/restaurant with lots of space. The service was very friendly and had pretty good food. Nice place to hangout with some friends. The food didn't stand out, but pretty good for \"bar food\"."}
{"text":"Would have walked in and right out again, but a very attentive waiter immediately asked us in and told us to find our favorite place...very comfortable and friendly...I think grey plaid flannel should be your regular uniforms at Taps! Food was good...starving and asked for the quickest appetizer...queso was out in two minutes! Beer wings and pizza were fresh, hot and yummy...sat and had an extra beer because we were so comfy..."}
{"text":"The bruschetta was great! Beers were super reasonably priced! And our server was super friendly, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the worst bars I have been to. My drink was empty the entire meal and the server never paid any attention to our table and instead was chatting with her co-workers in the bar displease with the service that was displayed before we even got  the appetizer. We dicided to leave however we waited around over 25 min to get the check. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this place a few times. The atmosphere is great, the food is pretty tasty and worth the price, but the service is pretty bad. When they are not busy, service is mediocre when they are busy, it has taken up to 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. Their staff always looks unhappy and lacking energy.  This place has all the elements to became a great local hangout, however their customer service is what keeps us from being regulars."}
{"text":"A beer pub that fakes at classy wine bar. Not too knowledgeable about the wine, good appetizers but SMALL portions."}
{"text":"I'd like to be able to say this was a bad dining experience, but we never able to dine!  The waitress saw us sit down, then NEVER came to our table!  We had to ask for a menu and then she proceeded to wait on 3 other tables that arrived after we did!  We were so disgusted we went next store and ate delicious Mexican food with outstanding service."}
{"text":"Found out today the owner has banned me from going back because of the bad review. Free poker is played there but what a joke owner and bad business practices."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to this bar regularly.  The last two visits have been a major disappointment. The service was horrible. Additionally,  I tried to food and drink, but was told they were out of some of the food items that I requested. Wow! They need a Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"So it was late at night and I was hungry for a snack. I called them up and ordered a large sausage pizza.my first clue should've been when the person on the phone asked if they still had sausage. So I went over to pick up the pizza and have a drink or two while I waited. I wasn't there for five minutes and the waitress spilled three drinks all over me. I move to the other end of the bar as they didn't clean it up very good. After waiting an hour for the pizza I started to become irritated. When the pizza was finally brought out it wasn't a sausage pizza and looked like a small pepperoni pizza. He offered to put some sausage on it for me... no thanks, I think I have waited long enough...  I would've been better off grabbing a tombstone pizza and cooking it I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the selection of beers on draft and the food is to die for. Bruschetta is the way to go! Sever was happy and enjoyed her job. Will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, nothing spectacular. I did like the wings however; I will never return. The service was awful! Rude wait staff is completely unacceptable!!! Even if the food had been phenomenal ( which it wasn't ), with horrible service I would never return. Boo Taps! Your staff sucks! We walked in and were practically scowled at. The waitress looked annoyed to answer any of our questions and take our order. It is not like she was busy, there was only one other table with two people at it. And, to top it all off she practically threw my change on the table after paying the bill. If you like piss poor service, Taps is the place for you!"}
{"text":"First stop in AZ on our way to Wigwam. Service was lax - seemed to be more concerned with getting ready for dinner. The cook would come out and sit at the bar when there were no orders to drink her soda. Food was ok - nothing to make you go back. Lots of tv's so we considered going back to catch a ball game."}
{"text":"I could take it or leave it. Has a chill atmosphere. Nothing special. I came here twice. Once with work and the second time with friends. The creepy waiter kept staring at me... eek"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to have a good beer here.  Waited to catch a bartender at the bar although there was a lot of activity by at least 3 different people(?) behind the bar until someone finally asked us what we wanted. This place wasn't even half full on a Friday night at 8pm?  When we finally ordered from the menu posted on the chalkboard \"Voodoo\" we were told they were out.  Well \"Hello\" when your're out don't you typically erase it off the chalkboard?! We ended up leaving disappointed with the service and availability of the posted drink menu."}
{"text":"Went to a Buffalo Bills party on Saturday night. One of the most fun parties I've been to. Really good tarts and beer wings too! This place earned my business. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner.  The waitress seemed to be intoxicated and wasn't really paying attention.   We ordered drinks and that took about 30 minutes to get.  We asked for a menu when we first arrived and that didn't come out until about 45 minutes later.   She kept pushing the lasagna on us when we didn't want it.  I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  Not a good thing when there are other restaurants 2 steps away."}
{"text":"Nice experience here. Really good burger and reasonable pricing. The crème brûlée though was pretty bland. Definitely more of a night scene than lunch but still good. Parking can be a serious issue though."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment last night with my brother and his wife. I started the night off with a double jack on the rocks which I was charged 10 dollars for. I went back to the bar for the same drink. This time I got a different bartender who charged me 13 dollars. At the time I didn't say anything in case the first bartender hooked it up. Instead I waited for the server and asked him the price of a double jack. When he came back he told me it was 9.50. Basically watch the prices as there is one bartender who is obviously over charging and pocketing the rest. Aside from this discrepancy I did enjoy my time and like the bar. Because it's a nice place I want to rate it higher but this one bartenders practices is not acceptable."}
{"text":"This place has to have the worst service of any bar that I have been too.  My wife and I went back 4 times because the food was just that good and we had hoped that the service issues where just a fluke.  After the 4th bad experience with the service we are done with this place, which is unfortunate because we really wanted to keep going back for the food.  Between the very slow service, inattentive staff and lack of a good attitude I rather go somewhere else where I actually enjoy the atmosphere.  We even went here one night that they were having a party and saw the servers hanging out at the party with, what appeared to be, their friends and colleagues and ignoring the customers.  If they can get a good manager in this place it may survive but after 2 months and 4 visits I haven't seen any change."}
{"text":"Really a place that's hiding in plain sight!! Got an invite to join a few friends of mine to Taps. At first had no idea about the crowd ir scene. Very welcoming and great bar setting. I was really surprised by theway big selection of craft brews, which is perfect because I am a craft beer fanatic! Their menu was very diverse, lots of different options. I went with their monday all day special of .75 cent wings. Great choice because I ordered 12 wings of all different sauces. Best part was my beer tab... only 7 bucks!!! Taps has definitely become a stop for monday night football!"}
{"text":"We just moved into this area of town and had heard about Taps, so we decided to give it a try for lunch.  I was kind of disappointed.  The food was okay, nothing really special. The prices are a little high,  my salad was not worth the $10.50 price.  The staff was pleasant but slow. Would I go again? Maybe. How would I describe it to everyone? \"It's okay.\""}
{"text":"Taps had it's soft opening last night for its 2nd location at Park West.  The place was absolutely packed!  But thankfully not so much that I couldn't find a seat.  They had a great live band playing and the food was really good.  I had the MacBites (fried macaroni & cheese balls with a sweet cheese sauce on the side) to start, followed by the Beet & Mozzarella salad which also had blueberries in it.  I never would've thought to eat beets and blueberries together but it was a great combination.  Then I had their CapreTasty Tart, which was chicken and pesto sauce in a yummy baked crust with some really good sauce on top.  It was really good!  I also tried my friend's vegetarian tart, the Kahlua Mushroom and it was very tasty!  Last but not least we finished it off with a huge skillet chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate and caramel sauces.  So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Easily some of the worst service I've ever had. Over priced and overrated at even one star. Rude servers. Slow service. Food average at best. Beers ok if you can get any. Stay away. Lots of better options out there."}
{"text":"Food and service are both pretty bad.  We have visited Taps a handful of times over the past 3 years, never really impressed but our visit yesterday was awful, and I was only there to pick up a to-go order.  We didn't even eat the food we got, it was so bad."}
{"text":"Dates wrapped in bacon taste great and presentation was good.  Server was friendly and timing was appropriate.  Smell was barely tolerable (Plumber was snaking drains).   Manager was quick to offer ice cream when my daughter fell walking up stairs.  They are still new but did a reasonable job.   I wish them"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday after work, asked to see a drink menu and ordered a bud light lime. The waitress came back and apologized she did not have any. I looked at the menu again and ordered some sort of cider. The waitress returned and informed me that they do not have that beer either. I ended up ordering a bud light bottle which was skunky. 

 We had a few friends join us, one ordered a scotch and soda, when he asked what kind of scotch they had, the bartender held up a bottle of Jim Beam!?!? He then asked for Brady and was told they did not have any and ended up settling on a beer.  Needless to say....we won't be coming back :)"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and is a great place to meet friends for cocktails.
But, the service was not so good.
The salsa for the chips was too salty and didn't taste right.
My husband ordered the carne asada and it wasn't worth eating.

If I return to Taps, it will only be for drinks and not for the food."}
{"text":"Kind of on the fence about this place....

I like the atmosphere, and their beer is cold and well served...

But the service is not always good.  I've found that the wait for them to take your credit card here is insanely long.

Also I've tried their food, which I describe as okay.
The pizza bites were fine, but they're something I could whip up in 10 minutes at home.
Their wings are okay, but aren't quite as crisp as I'd like.  I understand that they're marinated and baked, but perhaps baking them a bit longer or flipping them more often would lead to a more uniform-crispness.  My order was soggy in several places."}
{"text":"I've eaten and drank here several times.  The pizza is very good (have had both the pepperoni [on happy hour special] and the Five or Six Cheese [not on special but awesome]).  The food has been very good and the drinks are served right on time by an excellent wait staff.

I've mentioned both the owner and two bartenders that they should get a bottle of Compari.  IF they do that, they'll earn their fifth star."}
{"text":"We went here on a friday night and none of us were impressed. A friend and I both ordered beers and the glasses tasted very strongly of dish soap. The food was hit or miss for everyone. Some dishes were decent and others were pretty bad. Service was ok. Maybe we got them on an off night so we may try one more time."}
{"text":"Went to this place late night with a friend as it was the only place open in the area that was not reminiscent of a biker bar.

We had:
- Skillet queso dip
- Bacon flatbread (pizza)
- Cheese flatbread (pizza)

It was greasy and gave us heartburn and indigestion.

They gave us Seagrams when we asked for grey goose and the tab was $88 w/o tip.  For a beer, a grey goose and 3 apps that were horrible.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Believe the negative reviews. I came here after a round of golf, in order to have dinner and a few brews. The service wasn't terrible, it was non-existent. The waiter seemed to take an eternity to take our order. 

I ordered the Penne with Italian sausage, only to find out, they were out of sausage. The waiter suggested an alternative. I went ahead and ordered it. What I ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what I swear was frozen meatballs. At $12...what a shame.

As I'm done with my food and beer, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else, my check was just dropped off. Service and food were bad, I will never return."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this quaint little place and we were very pleased with the service and food. The wings are excellent and the pizza is also very good. There were several people there when we arrived on a Sunday afternoon and even though the place was pretty packed, our server was pretty fast and attentive to our needs. I could tell she was in the weeds too and I wanted to get up and help her but she still managed to take really good care of us and we did not have to wait for refills and our food came out within about 10 minutes. It is really a place for people who drink alcohol and we do not drink alcohol but had a coupon so decided to try it on that premise. Even though it is more of a bar than a restaurant, we will return for lunch again in the future and if we ever take friends out who like to drink, we will choose this place for sure."}
{"text":"New menu looks good, the new burger was great, I would prefer more options for a side other than chips, especially for $12.  The iced tea was horrible, need to keep it fresh, and NOT out of a fountain.   Nice beer choices and overall vibe of the place is good.  On a side note, I am glad to see them using pandora for the music, however, mix it up a tad or use a different channel.  I heard nothing but 3 Doors Down and Nickleback for a solid hour.."}
{"text":"What a terrible place! The vibe at the Park West location is nothing like the one in Litchfield Park. It is a cheap, unbranded knock off, wanna-be Hooters. We went early, around 7:30 on the Saturday before Halloween. All of the waitresses were dressed in \"costume.\" There was Provocative Prostitute, Provocative Cat, and Provocative I'm not sure but I think also Prostitute. I'm no prude by any means but there should still be a reasonable level of professionalism in a bar/restaurant located in the 'burbs early in the evening. The service was extremely slow and our waitress was inattentive. I will say she was very nice but clearly not hired not for her service experience. There was also a table in the back of shrieking children who apparently belonged to one of the  gentlemen working behind the bar (possibly manager?) either that or the Provocative Geisha was letting a stranger discipline her children. The music was so loud my husband and I had to scream louder than those shrieking kids to communicate with each other. Eventually we just stopped trying to talk and played with our phones. Not exactly how I wanted to spend the evening with my Honey. I am giving it 2 stars because the food was really good. My hubby likes his wings super crispy and he got just that and man were they tasty! I had one of the tarts and, it too, was delicious. The second star is for the music. Although ridiculously loud, the live music duo playing in the corner was talented and we enjoyed listening to them. I was also pretty shocked and dismayed by their draft beer selection. It was pretty basic for a placed called Taps. I would have assumed an extensive craft beer menu but the reality was that it had a couple of San Tan varieties and several other beers that you can find just about anywhere. A couple other things to notate were that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table, we didn't get silverware or napkins until after our food was brought to the table, and there was clearly no seating chart or defined sections for the servers because they were squabbling over who was going to take our table. The whole experience made me feel like I was on a taping of Restaurant Undercover."}
{"text":"so I go to the library near tap and around lunch time I decide to take my son and eat there. it was not a bad place, the server was really nice, we ordered a salad and I believe a flatbread pizza. honestly I didn't really like the pizza it was horrible I took it home to see if my husband would eat it and he usually eats everything but he hated it as well. that's when I know something is not good if my husband will not touch it either. I'm going to give it 3 stars because I may come down just to get drinks or something like that but definitely no pizza"}
{"text":"Great staff. Knowledgable, helpful, high energy.
Good selection of quality beers on tap. 
Thai green chili chicken and rice was decent, much milder than I expected but tasty and well-presented.
As noted in another review, they are working through challenges of an infrastructure run down by previous franchise ownership, which manifested in solid flaking in my beer, sloughed off the tap line. The bartender was profusely apologetic and comped me a fresh beer."}
{"text":"Go for the beer, they have a good selection. The food was mediocre. I ordered a sandwich, and was expecting a salad, or fries as a side, but was instead given lays potato chips. For $10, I'd expect something a little more than chips."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure whether to go high or low based on my experience so it was middle ground all the way.  I ordered a vodka tonic.  Small or Large?  Large, of course.  It came out in a pint glass.  Not quite what I was expecting.  That being said, it tasted like it was just one shot in the huge glass...not good at proportions.  Our time there was fun, but it was the company; not the joint.  The blaring TV right over our booth didn't help with the ambience either :("}
{"text":"Not great. I would choose it over TK's across the street but that's not saying much. The bartender was friendly when we walked in and offered us samples but that was the extent of decent service we got.

The beer selection was good. Not great. I would expect a place called \"Taps\" to have at least 25 brews on tap, they have more like 15. Still my husband was happy they had multiple IPA's. I cracked up that they had Charles Shaw wine to serve. Note to readers; this wine cost $3 a BOTTLE. 

On to the food. Don't do it. They have a \"new chef\" so we went for items that you can't screw up. News flash...you can screw up a grilled cheese! How? You ask? Douse it in artificially flavored oil and cook it just enough to NOT melt the cheese. Yuck!!! Go back to the drawing board...this is NOT an acceptable representation of one of he finest foods ever created.

One last note...who on earth has cigars on their menu?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was for dinner, the second time for brunch. Both times though, and this is a big pet peeve of mine, we walked in and felt dumb because it took us a bit to realize it was self seating. I wish they had a sign or something. I forgot for a second the second time when I walked in, but quickly remembered when the bartender looked at me, didn't say anything, and then looked away. There were 4 people in there, she could have at least said hi or something, I would have heard her. But that is when I realized it was a seat yourself kind of thing. 

Ok, so dinner was not that great. I had the cheese pizza thing and it was awful. Not a fan. My husband had buffalo wings, he thought they were ok. My mother in law got a hamburger and she really liked hers! I thought to myself, self, this would be a fun place to come for drinks, not to eat. It's really cool inside with the brick and all.

Then I saw a Groupon for brunch. So my hubby and I decided to give their breakfast a shot. Especially since we live so close, I really WANT to like this place. And yay for us, breakfast was yummy! I had a southwestern omelet. It had red and green peppers (A LOT of them, actually. too many for my taste, but if you like them, then you'll LOVE this), black beans, corn and cheese in it. It came with a side of salsa, sour cream and quac. And tater tots! When was the last time you had a tot? It was awesome. Loved it! My husband had some meat omelet (I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't really pay attention to what kind of meat he was eating (that's what she said)). It came with tater tots as well and he really liked it. The mimosas could have had a TAD bit more champagne in them. They were included in with the groupon, but I saw that they were $6. If I had to pay $6 for that, I would have been super annoyed. 

So all in all, I'll be back... for breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"Used to be awesome but the new owner ruined this place. Servers are slow and clueless and the owner hangs out getting drunk with the weirdo regulars...or maybe those are his buddies. Its also not zoned for smoking but the owner ignores that. Stinky with scary cougars and pervs."}
{"text":"We go to lunch at least once a week at a different restaurant and use lots of Groupons, Deal Chicken, Living Social deals, etc.  Taps had the best food we have had since moving to Phoenix almost two years ago.  I had the Philadelphia Tart and my wife had the baked talapia sandwich.  I went ahead and got the house salad ($2.50) while I waited for the tart to be cooked (the menu indicated a wait of possible 15 minutes for the tart put it came in around 10 min. and well worth the wait).  I expected it to be a small bowl of head lettuce but was I surprised at the size of the salad and the different greens, cherry tomatoes, nice big chunks of great bacon, etc.  I should have just left it at the salad but here came the tort which was excellent with one cup of smoky cheddar cheese sauce and another cup of beef wine beef gavy. The dough was light and flaky and the wife's chibata roll was not a big gob of bread as many are and did not over power the delicious sandwich fixings.  I could not believe the selection of tarts they offered and am excited about going back and trying some of the others.  The waitress was nice and efficient and the place itself (including the bathroom) was first rate and spotless.  Can you tell I liked the place??  Very impressed and will return soon!!"}
{"text":"I went to Taps 3 times.
First time I ordered a non-alcoholic beer. I would have even been happy with something domestic, but they had nothing at all. I perused the menu and found that everything was overpriced. 
Second visit - Around 10pm on Sunday, Memorial Day weekend. It was closed. I figured it was because of my poorly timed visit. 
I went again at about 9:45pm Saturday, June 1. 
No lights. No cars. No customers. No employees. 
I'm guessing that Matthew, the guy who wrote the first review, is a shill. Nobody else felt as good about the place as he did, so it appears that they are no longer in business. 
Too bad. the area needs a hopping place with a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"==================== UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP=================

Right off I should known something was different. On their website it says \"Taps is a chef-driven restaurant and bar that specializes in a friendly neighborhood approach to hospitality; from-scratch signature and creative cuisine\". Looking at the menu all I saw was normal everyday bar food being offered, My wife & I came here today because we had a gift card. I mentioned I had a gift card to our server Page and she explained the bar is under new ownership and they are not taking the gift cards anymore.

Because we were hungry we decided to stay. Page was very attentive and brought us our drinks right away. She gave us ample time to peruse the menu and we both finally decided on a burger..

I asked that my burger to be cooked medium. My wife wanted her's medium rare. Both burger were brought to us well done. That being said before I sent it back I decided to try it. Like I said I was hungry. The burger actually tasted very good despite it being well done. It was thick, appetizing and juicy. My wife thought the same thing so we kept the burgers. 

There was an odd flavor to both burgers we couldn't figure out. All I can say it was interesting. 

   --------------------------------------- OMG the fries   ---------------------------------------

One thing that is worth mentioning is their fries. I don't know about you but I love McDonalds fries. Normally restaurants don't even come close to their fries. Well Taps had fries that matched the look, taste and flavor as close to McDonalds that I have ever experienced. AMAZING!!

FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from bar.  SERVICE: Our waitress Page was friendly, professional and attentive. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is spot on.  AMBIANCE: Modern looking sports bar. They have a wine bar in the back (probably left from the previous owner). CONCLUSION: I think its a great little bar if you want to drink, mingle, or watch sports. RETURN FACTOR 100%.

{"text":"I've only come in here to drink before watching movie at Harkins. The drinks have always been good and the staff has always been friendly. I did have to find my waitress a couple time to get my bill so I wouldn't be late for my movie, but it's no big deal."}
{"text":"Got a groupon to try this place out... not impressed. Bad service - food was not great. Will not be back. To top it off, a 20% gratuity was added to our bill."}
{"text":"We decided to try Taps for lunch yesterday as we wanted an outside lunch so what the heck right?  Glad we did, we enjoyed the patio/streetside seating in the sun.  Our waitress was not very good, but the food made up for it.  We look forward to coming back and trying it again!  They seem to have quite a menu and if you are a drinker a great selection to be found.

Their menu can be viewed at: http://www.tapsbars.com/Menus.aspx"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE taps! This place is full of amazing staff, and the owners are awesome!! I've started coming here regularly after work for the past 4months and every time the experience is always the same; warm, friendly, and loads of fun. They have new affordable specials/drinks and entertainment for everyday of the week with a great crowd every time! I definitely recommend this place for any day of the week :)"}
{"text":"Be prepared for terrible service and a rough clientele. An older man took a swing at another guy and was put in a headlock and taken outside. There's a reason they have a bouncer at this bar. Weird vibe for being so close to the wigwam. It's a neat building, but below average food and service. Too bad. Such a great location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local hangouts to just relax with a beer and eat some good food. The pizza and wings are great- haven't tried much else but they are always expanding the menu choices. When its cool the patio is a great place to sit and people watch- nice ambiance. I like trivia night too and even won a $50.00 gift certificate. Also a good place to watch sports games. Say 'hi' to Dave for me and enjoy!"}
{"text":"so believe it or not i went here 3 times before i ordered anything. FIRST TIME: it was a friday night. it was busy and even though we were acknowledge, no one ever came to take at least a drink order, so we left. SECOND TIME: wednesay night 10 pm kitchen closed but bar open until 2am, no indication anywhere on line or on location of kitchen hours. THIRD TIME AND LAST ATTEMPT: thursday 2pm, finally ordered something, we got Leinenkugels to drink($4 not on happy hour, awesome) we got wings, beer and medium, loved them both, i got the hamburger(delicious and worth the prize, with awesome fries) my wife got the pesto chicken sandwich which she enjoyed.

service was pretty good, previous times not so good. (ive been to the litchfield location, one of the worst service i had) it would of been 5 stars if my firt impression would of been like my third. 

thanks to the awesome food and prices i will be back."}
{"text":"I am a happy hour hound and beer aficionado so my wife suggested we check out happy hour at Taps. I guessed from the name that beer was to be found on tap, and indeed there was.

While the 12 beers change occasionally, the beers offered on tap today included Bud Light, Pyramid Apricot Ale, Sun Up IPA, a Belgian white beer, Stella, Guinness, and Harp. The other five I didn't recognize and were mostly local beers. We ordered the Pyramid and the Sun Up.

We ordered the combination pizza that they call the \"Deluxe Flatbread.\" It includes traditional combo toppings like pepperoni, sausage, bell pepper, red onion, and mushroom, but then they go and add bacon just for fun. The sauce on the menu is listed as \"red sauce\" but the flavor was delightfully different from traditional pizza sauces that favor oregano and bay leaves. The crust was flatbread. While I have no complaints about the taste or quality, I'm just not a fan of flatbread and wish they had an option for a more traditional crust. The shape is square and the size is equivalent to a  large round pizza, but the flatbread left my larger-than-average appetite wanting another slice or two (I'm a hungry fatty). If we order pizza next time we'll also get a salad or appetizer to make a meal out of it.

I think the best part of Taps are the people who work there. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, lighting our candle and checking up on us regularly. She didn't try to convince us to order two entrees (like they do at CPK) or order too many beers. I think we may have run in to the owner on the way out who asked if everything was alright and thanked us for visiting.

My complaints are minor; enough to knock off one star but not enough to keep us away. The silverware was cheap and I may have bent the fork while cutting one of the middle pizza squares (the ones without crust to hold). The leather couch area was comfortable, but the table was too low to put drinks on, so we moved to a table when our pizza arrived. I felt the prices were a bit high on the pizza, burgers, and sliders, while the sandwiches, sides, and non-happy hour beer prices were reasonable. Last, I know 9 out of 10 guys around here drink Bud Light exclusively but why waste one of the 12 taps on a crappy domestic when they could be pouring another local, Sierra Nevada, or something from New Belgium? Also, it would be nice if they posted the beer and wine menu on their website.

Beyond the great people who work there, the other highlights for me were the location in Litchfield Park, the outdoor patio, the HD TVs, the emphasis on local beers on tap, and I'm looking forward to checking out the band who plays on Wednesday and Friday.

We will definitely be visiting again. My wife would like to explore their wine menu and I'd like to try nine of the other beers on tap, their appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and wings."}
{"text":"Just went here today with coworkers despite the horrible reviews(ask them why they wanted to go here)
BUT THEY ARE CLOSED AND OUT OF BUSINESS."}
{"text":"We live down the street and stopped in to meet up for lunch with my fiancé's parents. We shared a sandwich and chips and it was just \"OK\"- nothing special, but definitely overpriced. There was a group of middle-aged people playing Wii or something who were extremely loud. They were the only other people in the whole place, so it was a little awkward. I don't really remember the service being anything but decent, so we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Sometimes they have a decent craft beer selection. I wouldn't drink anything else there. Soo, I sitting at the bar enjoying an Oskar blues ipa and watched  the bartender pour a Coors light for a customer. In the middle of the pour, the tap blew and without hesitation he poured it out and put in budlight instead... gave it to the customer like nothing ever happened."}
{"text":"Horrible! Used to like this place but obviously since ownership changed so did the cook! Had beer wings which were pretty good similar to what they had before! That's what gave the 1 star! Service was horrible! Plates were dirty! We ordered fish & chips was great before...NOT NOW! It was sooo greasy the batter fell off the fish & there was a puddle of grease on the plate! The one bite I took had a bad grease taste & the fish was not cleaned well either. Asked for more lemons & was given lemons on a napkin from the bar! The staff looks very unprofessional & was talking to each other the whole time. We were only checked in on by our server 1 time! & no refills on our sodas ! I'm sure this place will be gone soon...hope something good takes it's location! Wasted $40 & fast food would have been better"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a shopping trip. The prime dip was excellent. I can still taste it now and I'm writing this review weeks after.  This is a great place to grab a beer before a movie or dinner before a movie. Can't wait to try something else on the menu. One more tidbit: The music playing here was excellent, I heard around 5 songs in a row that were great and I'm not talking only top 20 hits, these were everything from alternative to popular music. Anyways, I can't remember the last time I heard two good songs in a row that I loved or even recognized at any restaurant much less 5 extraordinary songs that you recognize and love. It's like the restaurant was luring me in slowly with great food and music.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at this little bar to grab a cocktail and a snack after meandering about the Litchfield Art Fest. The little patio is perfect for people watching and seems very dog friendly. It seemed that several of the people around us knew each other and there was a sense of community at this little bar. This place has a surprisingly small beer list considering it is named \"TAPS\". The Chardonnay I ordered was good. My boyfriend ordered a couple of beers and we enjoyed their kettle chips. Our waitress was attentive and very chipper."}
{"text":"Glad they are gone. I hope they paid the family that they let get so drunk he killed a mother of a 5 year old girl. I am sure they all went and got jobs in more bars to ruin more lives."}
{"text":"Woodchuck Raspberry Cider on tap! It is great in a bottle but the levels of deliciousness rise to epic proportions on draft. My dad and I just wanted to catch a little bit of whatever game was going on...ok, so it was just my dad who cared about the game. We shared a $5 personal pizza that was a happy hour special...it was extremely cheesy. We also had a few local IPAs which were good. I think the craft beers win out over the food. Nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Dave is awesome! he makes sure you have exactly what you need, remembers your name and deserves a raise! The waitresses are rude and completely ignored us..walking by our table looking at us without saying a word (and this isn't a 1 time occurrence).  Other than that, the food is good, the atmosphere is fun and the drinks are strong."}
{"text":"Have TAPS another chance. Came here 6mths ago and man it hasn't changed. 20 minutes for someone to our drink order, 15+min for our food order and 30+min for our food to come out! PLUS the waitress messed up our drink order and stated \"I got you what you ordered...\" Like I didn't know my drink order... REALLY!?!? DONE!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for Taps and I'm glad I did. For 3 people, our bill came out to be just a little under 5.00. We enjoyed the cool weather and sat on the patio (they could use a bit more lighting for when it gets darker). We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which had a nice tang to it from the balsamic vinegarette and lots of fresh cut tomatoes. I really enjoyed it! For entrees, we had the BLT, Chicken Ranch Salad, and Mushroom Swiss Burger. All delicious and priced well. The BLT and burger came with seasoned fries. My chicken ranch salad came with a bbq ranch that was amazing! Will definitely be coming back here! Our waitress was friendly, but just know that it is self seating. We stood around for a minute or two before the waitress came out and told us to feel free to sit anywhere we like."}
{"text":"Bought this on Groupon, and I know I will not buy one for here again, even if I get it at the reduced rate.  Many items on menu either out or no longer offfered, and what I had was a aflat bread pizza and no flavor.  FLAT for sure.  The resturants on either side had people eating at it but not ours, and our waitress did not have a clue about anyuthing we asked her."}
{"text":"I purchased a Gift certificate and took my son there for a Friday night dinner and play some pool. The staff greeted us as soon as we entered and was very nice. We were sat in the open pool bar area. The music was too loud but it is a bar. The food was great up until the Creme Brule was served. It was cold and the caramelized glaze was just burnt sugar. I gave them 4 stars because they are trying to make things better. Very nice staff and management. We will be back."}
{"text":"After coming to Taps a few times and enjoying the experience, I decided to purchase a Groupon for a wine and cheese tasting for 4 people for $89.

Even though the Groupon ad didn't specify it, the restaurant representative insisted that the Groupon could only be used on a weekday during lunch time (due to the claim that they are too busy on the weekends- which I know is not true from experience).  If the Groupon would have specified that, I would have never bought it.  Who would?  

I spent over 3 total months between getting permission from the manager to have the event on a Friday evening and waiting for the unresponsive representative to respond and schedule the event.  After 3 months of trying to schedule the event, I was finally able to schedule it for my birthday!!!

My group of 4 people took a taxi there on my birthday and the bartender (who was in charge at the time) stated that the person who scheduled the event did not order the supplies.  Knowing that they have food in the back and plenty of wine bottles on the wine shelves, I attempted to plead with the bartender to make something work, to which she finally agreed.  I had to inform the waitress on the correct order of the wines and she brought out pork even though I requested for there not to be any pork.  Although we made the best of the situation and enjoyed the wine and food, it was not the experience that I paid for and it permanently tainted my interest in Taps.  

On a bright note, they have some live music and cheap homebrews ($1.98 or 99 cents during happy hour), but the service consistently sucks.  I may come here for a couple cheap beers after Toby Keiths in the future, but that's about it.  Unless they make some serious changes, their lack of customer service and advertising will probably lead them down a long road towards closure."}
{"text":"I hate to bring them down a star but we went on a recent Saturday night for a friend's birthday. We arrived about 10 PM and were I.D.'d at the door by the bouncer. Yet as the night wore on we noticed quite a few children, from teenagers down to toddlers, running around the establishment, especially on the \"dance floor\" where the DJ was. It's a little unsettling to sit around with friends drinking at a bar while there are kids everywhere. There was no way for us to play pool or even make our way out to the patio without having to ask the families to let us by. I'm all for family time but a bar at 11:30 on a Saturday night is hardly the appropriate place. I'm assuming the children were family or friends of the owners or managers since everyone else was carded at the door with a clear requirement of being over 21 to enter. A post on the facebook page elicited a request to e-mail management and someone would respond. There has not even been an acknowledgement that it was received as of yet. We'll be keeping Taps as a happy hour spot, not for the weekends until they figure out what vibe they're going for."}
{"text":"Saying goodbye to a friend who is moving across the country is never easy.  But...when you surround yourself with friends, drinks, food, and laughs...it lessens the heartache.

This place has a GREAT happy hour and the server did an amazing job accommodating our large and crazy party with separate checks and all!

Beer is cold, shots are chilled, and the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there as we've purchased a Groupon in November 2011. It is located in the mid of a very nice neighbourhood. First we thought the place was closed as it looked really dark. But it was open. The atmosphere is more like in a pub where you want to hang out in the evenings. And there was a workshop held in the same room that day and there were guests at another table and that was all. Many dishes in the menu card were crossed out (this didn't make a good impression to me). We've ordered burgers well done as we were asked how we'd like them to be cooked. Unfortunately they came medium and I ate it anyway but my husband just cannot eat burgers that are not cooked well done. We should have said something but we didn't. The waiter saw the plate that was almost untouched but he didn't even ask a word, which is disappointing. I think you should try to satisfy the guests if you want them to come back and try to correct things if something went wrong. Also the portion of the side which were potatoe chips was really small and with the price of over 9 Dollars for one burger and some chips I think it was totally overpriced. For me the burger was only ok. I don't know if it is more attractive to go there in the evenings and listen to live music. Unfortunately we are disappointed enough of this place to not go back and find out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, and have always enjoyed the experience.  They have great happy hour prices and the food on the menu is delightful!"}
{"text":"Wow just came into town on business, what a great place! Modern, great music with an awesome atmosphere. Very interesting and friendly people here. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say.  We never got to eat because the service was so horrible.  The two girls on the floor were more interested in twirling their hair and chatting with another girl (obviously an out of uniform co-worker) than taking care of guests.  The dining room was dirty and tables were in disarray.  When they finally greeted us, they said \"hey guys, no food but drinks are available.\"  When I asked what time they stopped serving she said \"10, but if it's slow we quit making food\".  Slow?  On a Saturday night?  At 9:30?  Ok, whatever."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for the first time today. We walked In ans were greated by the owner. He explained the craft beers, asked what we normally like. He then recommended a beer that was awsome! . We order bruschetta was out of this world. Sorry honey even better than yours. The balsamic vinegar they drizzle on it sets it off. I jad the prime dip. You can taste every Ingredient!  
We will come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting Taps today for a business lunch.  I like that this little street has some cute little locally owned eateries to check out.  

First, they have Hooegarden on draft.  This is big for me, so I was happy to be able to enjoy my favorite beer on draft.  The waitress forgot my lemon which this beer is traditionally served with, but eventually brought it to me after I asked.  

We started out with the queso dip which was fantastic.  Warm cheese, how can you go wrong?  Our queso came with chips that were of your standard (but tasty) variety.

I ordered the single vegetarian sandwich off of the lunch menu which turned out to be pretty fantastic.  It had grilled eggplant, peppers, mushrooms and other veggie yumminess on it topped with a three-cheese blend and feta.  It was perfectly toasted and delicious.  I love veggie sandwiches that don't make you feel like you need something more without the meat and this was totally it!  It was also only six bucks, which I thought was really reasonable for this place.

We got a lot of smiles from the variety of people that were working but our waitress was a bit off.  She didn't clear our plates until I asked her to (despite the pads of paper and clear work we were trying to get done).  For some reason this was really bothersome to me since we were the only patrons in the restaurant for the two hours that we were there.  Pay attention and clear our stuff!  

It also appeared that they have something special going on every night.  This isn't exactly the side of town I find myself on often, but they do offer karaoke on Thursday evenings.  

Although I want to check out the other restaurants on this little row, I'd most definitely come back to Taps for Hooegarden on draft and that veggie sandwich!  I just hope I don't have to remind the waitress of her duties the next time I am in!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning around 10, as Black Bear Diner was full with people waiting.  This place had good reviews on Yelp, and no wait!

The waitress offered us coffee, so we took her up on her offer.  The coffee was awesome!

I inquired about the biscuits and gravy, but the waitress said they were out of biscuits and of sausage.  Hubby & I both ordered the Southwest Omelette (black beans, corn, red & green bell peppers, onion, jalapeno and cheese) and added bacon to it.  I also ordered a side of gravy (hey, I judge biscuits & gravy by the gravy, too -- I wanted to try it!).

The food came and it looked amazing.  There were several tater tots on the side, so we dipped these in the gravy -- YUMMM!  The omelette also came with sour cream, fresh-made pico and guac on the side.  It was smashing.  The omelette had cheese baked on top, it was soooo good.  We both were really delighted in the amount of food (which I couldn't finish) we received and the price.  We were out, with tip, under $20!

Taps, we WILL be back for dinner!  I want to try that Blue Crab Pizza!!"}
{"text":"We tried this new place, even though there was only one car in the parking lot during lunch hour. The waitress was super nice and took feedback well, and there was a lot of feedback from my husband about the food. We ordered chips and salsa - the chips clearly came from the 99 cent store and the \"salsa\" was a little container of pink tomatoes and onions. my husband ordered a double Beam and Coke. Even though they had Jim Beam stuff everywhere, no Jim Beam yet. 

My husband had the carne asada, which looked promising. A big pile of meat with several char-grilled tortillas. Unfortunately they forgot to season the meat AT ALL and the tortillas were purchased at the same store as the chips. Maybe throwing in some onions and peppers would have helped. 

I had a salad (standard salad fare) and mac and cheese bites that we sampled at Costco last weekend (although the sauce was delicious.) 

So, with the $9 drink (double Captain and Coke) lunch was $44. Way too pricey for food that was mediocre, at best. If the food was good, it would be well priced. 

Again, can't rave enough about the server but the kitchen needs to get it together and maybe taste their own food."}
{"text":"Awesome bartenders!  Great prices on beer (especially during happy hour)!  My only complaint was that the chicken tender portion seemed more like an appetizer rather than an entree and it didn't come with a dipping sauce - barbecue or ranch would have made them much better!  Definitely will be back here!  It's great to have a neighborhood bar hangout again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, crowd and music! Food has always been quite a bit better than most bars. Even the salad was great. Wonderful staff and great service. Will definitely be back. Perfect spot for happy hour with co-workers on the outdoor patio. Advise..fire up the outdoor smoker/bbq's!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. It is not my favorite place but I am glad I checked it out. We went here for a late lunch on a Thursday with a groupon. They did not have enough staff for how many people were there, and we didn't see our waitress that much, and it took her a while to get around to us. It wasn't her fault, she was very nice but just too busy. 
Anyways, maybe we ordered wrong but we ended up with really heavy meals. Even all the kids meals were pretty heavy and fried. No healthy options for the kiddos. I felt kind of bad giving my baby fried mac and cheese with potato chips. I had a portobello sandwich and it was good. My mom had one of the baked dishes, and she said it was ok, very heavy and the pastry itself wasn't her favorite. 

I am glad we had the groupon because everything was kind of expensive. I think my sandwich was 12 or 13 dollars which is a little much. We still had to pay a little out of pockets for 2 meals and a kids meal.

Would I go back? I think it would be a fun place to have some beers and snacks with my husband and friends, but not great for lunch with mom and the baby."}
{"text":"This bar was terrible. 

I came in on a friend's suggestion to go grab drinks and talk about where we're going for the weekend in San Diego. We sat ourselves, with a party of 6, and the entire bar was mostly empty. We waited for a while, and ended up making our own table. 

The waitress came down, said she was sorry and she was caught up with another customer and that's why she couldn't come greet us. (Granted there were other waiters just hanging around, not doing anything. Could she have sent them?)

So we order food, and some beers. She wasn't sure of what they had on tap ,and referred us to the menu. My boyfriend and I hadn't eaten, and were planning to get bar food. I should have trusted the less than 3 stars this place got. 

I ordered mini grilled cheese's for $1.00 each. Great deal for something that's essentially bread and \"artisan\" cheese. What did I get? A little, flat, half-dollar sized \"sandwich\" full of melted shredded cheese (Artisan!), on a wooden pallet. It took up maybe 10% of this giant pallet when I ordered two. 

I decided to save myself with mini pizzas. Rather, they were tiny slices of over buttered bread, lathered in COLD pasta sauce... unmelted mozzarella cheese... and cold pepperoni. The pepperoni was unexpected, and not in a nice way. I'm a vegetarian. Faaantastic.

During this whole cheese / pepperoni fiasco, there was an older karaoke guy who was playing Midwestern music from the 70's. He was trying to get us to dance, and I'm trying just to figure out our whale-watching schedule in the back of the restaurant. We're there in the back of the restaurant for a reason! Anyway, he come over, and GRABS MY ARM to pull me up and dance with him to \"I'm sexy and I know it.\" I had donated blood that day, bruised my arm, and at this point I was so hungry and grossed out I just snapped at him.

At this point, I went outside for a cigarette, to have an old bald man ask me to \"light his fire\"... and he was calling for me and my friend as we were walking to our car, asking us to stay and party with him.

NEVER. GOING. BACK. EVER. 

p.s. Two TV's right next to each other were 10 seconds out of sync. OCD nightmare. 

p.p.s. I swear I am normally such a happy person! Don't judge me! :P"}
{"text":"Oh my! I thought long and hard about not doing a review for this place but it just rubbed us the wrong way. Let me start out on a positive note, the Hispanic waitress was real personable and on top of her game. She stepped in for our waitress who seem to disappear or always be on her cell phone.The owner should see these reviews and revamp their cell phone policy. 

The decor was very nice and the place felt warm and inviting, when I walked in I wanted to give this place a great review that is until we actually ate. We ordered two sandwiches but wanted some wings to come out first. after about 25 minutes our sandwiches were ready and I overheard our waitress telling the cook (who was eating in the kitchen visibly)  that we were supposed to have wings first. Then she came to our table with a story about how they hadn't been prepped and would be another 8-10 minutes before they would be done. I was hungry and now had food and was curious to try them so I agreed that it would be okay. The story seemed made up on the fly but that's besides the point. It was over 15 minutes before we received the wings (not 8-10) and they were not cooked right at all, very squishy and gross. I'm never looking for anything for free but these late items usually save your company customers when comped and that wasn't even a thought.

 My sandwich was good but was over packed with ingredients and even though I originally turned away silverware, when I needed it our waitress was texting at the bar. My wife's sandwich was packed full of mayo, and pre made, not very appetizing. By that time we just wanted to leave, especially with the cook staff wheeling the trash through the restaurant and stopping to flirt with the texting waitress leaving the overflowing trash feet from our table. Nothing about our experience made us want to come back again except our fill in waitress who helped out in the beginning.On another positive note the bar tender seemed friendly and professional."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been going to this neighborhood place for awhile, and I'm just not getting to this review. Partly because I'm a little lazy these days...and partly because I wanted to keep this place a secret. It's located next to the \"World Famous\" Wigwag resort, so this little neighborhood spot is easily missed in the grandeur of the Wigwag. Here is the jist of it:
* They don't have a very extensive wine list, and only a few craft beers on   
   the list...but nice selection of spirits.
* The 'can't miss' items on the menu are:
   - Tomato and Balsamic Bruccita - by and far the best thing they have. 
      During Happy Hour these little squares are dirt cheap. The tomato
      taste very fresh and the mixture pops in your mouth (In a good way).
   - Their wings: Yeah, I know...but they are air fried wings. Trust me.
   - Flatbread Pizza: Cheap, filling, and wicked good.
* They have Live music throughtout the week.. Good talent mixed with 
   good food in a locally owned atmosphere has always make me a 
   happy yelper.
* We haven't taken advantage of the patio seating, but it looks really 
   inviting. Normally when we go, the place next door has a handful of 
   Vacationers outside smoking, and it's right next to the patio. 

All in all, this is a great low key place to go and just enjoy an evening. It's
not going to be a high dollar gourmet cusine some people are looking for, it's more American Bar Food elevated to a higher standard.  It's a great place for those locally to visit or if they are at the Wigwag and want to 'go local' for night."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. The place was pretty full but there were only 3 waitresses working. They were hustling though. We were seated quickly and our waitress was quick with the drinks and refills. Food was good and I had a Groupon so that helped with the bill. My only complaint is that the music was playing instead of the baseball game. Would have preferred to hear the game since it is the playoffs."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I decided to give Taps Signature Cuisine & Bar at Park West a try.  We had been to this building in its former life \"as Rustica\".  It has been fun to see a couple of different operators make a go of it in what is really a great space.  As we sat at the bar and enjoyed a bottle of wine and 3 courses we were compelled to share our impressions in hopes that the team that is putting Taps together will read and take note.  They are on the right track but need some minor adjustments.  

Sooo,,, The food was certainly a high point.   We shared  a Knishnosh, a small tart filled with ribeye and mashed potatoes and covered with a tasty sauce.   The  presentation of this cleverly named item was fantastic.  When the server mispronounced the name of the tart it fell a bit flat. We also had a house salad which exceeded expectations and finished with the Hot Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Again a great presentation with a thin soft cookie \"sautéed\"  on a iron skillet topped with ice cream.  The fresh berries seemed to be overkill however.  The Chef was consistently present moving between the dining room and the kitchen.  I would recommend he make a personal visit to diners mid point in their meal.  This would likely result in a lot of positive feedback for chef as well as building a personal connection with new patrons.

The atmosphere of this room has always been a bit odd.  The new owners  have added a very cute wine rack (thanks Wine Styles) which would stand out more if painted a different color than the rest of the room (cobalt blue?).  The space is industrial by design but some plants and art would soften the edges.   The lighting is atrocious.  WIth the Home Depot bathroom  lights at full tilt over the server station and with the bulbs removed over the Jazz Trio the room was severely off balance.  Two out of three of the track lights over the Trio work, leaving the guitarist to pick in the dark.   

The servers are trying really hard but could use some standards and leadership.   We walked in with no greeting and sorted out seating for ourselves.   NO ONE TOLD US THEIR NAME.  If they had I would be mentioning the ones who did well here (    ).  Our server/bartender redeemed herself from the earlier mispronunciation with some good recommendations, efficient service, and a friendly smile.  Unfortunately her shift ended half way through our meal.  She said goodnight and she introduced us to her replacement who promptly forgot we were there.  We spent the next hour flagging down anyone who's eye we could catch for service. Fortunately the regular bartender took a break for an hour or so.  Nicole (i asked)  stepped in and picked up where our earlier server left off.  Along with letting us know we were not invisible, she cleaned up the wall of glasses left by the bartender at the end of the bar and swept up the broken glass on the floor.  She was a bright light in the service team.  The Hostess was on post when we departed  and sent us off with a fond farewell.

The middle aged man at the bar  wearing the Fedora combined with the Jazz Trio gave me great hope when we walked in.  Had we found a new, cool place to escape in the west valley?   As the evening unfolded it became apparent that this is not the case.   At around 9 the ends of the bar filled with servers texting under the bright lights.  This seemed to attract the \"hats on backward\" boys that frequented \"Rustica\".  I suspect that if these guys were actually paying for their drinks they would find somewhere else to drink for free

Again... the news here is good.  With good food and drink, an attempt at atmosphere and some leadership this may become a cool and convenient spot for west siders!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to finding a decent local pub with great beer on tap.This is not the place.The service was so bad we left.We waited more than 15 minutes to be served a beer.Never happened.We asked to see the beer list ,they dont have one.We asked 2 young men standing behind the bar about a local beer they didnt know,and were informed  they were too young to drink beer.And found out they were the chiefs!!
We went 2 doors down to get our beer.They have professional servers."}
{"text":"How exciting to have a bar named \"Taps\" open in our neighborhood.  My husband and I went during the 'soft opening', having heard great things about the Litchfield Park location.  We left our email addresses for an invitation to a Grand Opening party, and the food was good, but a little pricey (as expected for a restaurant in this area).  The server was helpful and informed us that they planned to stay open until 2 a.m. most nights, which is great for us since we are night shift people. 

More than a month later we received no email confirmation to the Grand Opening, but figured our email addresses were lost, no big deal, things like that happen.  Last week we attempted to have a beer at 12:30 am on a Saturday and the bar was closed.  Ok, maybe it was a slow night.  

Tonight, on our way home from the D-backs game we stopped in at 10:45 pm.  We chose to sit at a booth, there were a few small parties and one large party in the bar, and a nice jazz band playing.  After about five minutes, our waitress came over with drink menus, told us the kitchen was closed but the bar was still open.  My husband asked what time was last call and the server said \"around 1:00 a.m., but it depends on business\".  Great...  all we wanted was a few beers to wind down.   My husband stated that he saw the waitress roll her eyes toward us when we sat down.  If I would have seen that, we would be out the door.  The band wrapped up at 11:00 pm, the large party left shortly afterward, and at 11:30, after not checking on us one time, our server brought us our check and said \"sorry guys, I have to kick you out\".  No offer for a second beer or last call or anything.  

Just a note on the beer selection.  Some good local brews, but mostly domestics and beers you can go down the street and get at Applebee's for half price.  

Overall a very disappointing and unfriendly atmosphere.  This is a nice concept for a new bar, but your servers need customer service classes."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Taps for the first with my girlfriend. Immediately upon walking in it was extremely uncomfortable. Everybody stared as we walked in and there was no hostess and no seat your self sign posted.  Couldn't even tell who was an employee or a customer. Eventually receiving no service we walked back out. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Left in complete disgust. Poor service and this location looks NOTHING like as described on the website. They did nothing to remodel and it still looks (and smells) like the rt o's that was here prior."}
{"text":"Family and I lucked upon this casual gem our first night on vacation. Happy hour till 7, jukebox, sports, great food and perfect service."}
{"text":"Terrible. Service BAD!  The food was ok. Place looks exactly like RTO'SULLIVAN'S . They did nothing but new signage. . Walked in at noon and the place was like a morgue. No music no nothing. Needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Very nice experience.  We went there for lunch a couple of weeks ago - had the strawberry fields salad, beer chicken wings & the grilled cheese brucshetta - it was all awesome !  Very attentive wait staff.  One thing I have had to send back each time I've been there though is their ice tea - it's gross!  other than that I reccomend it"}
{"text":"Great service! Very nice bartender who gave us some great drinks. I needed a quick pick me up so I asked for a cup of black coffee around 8pm to keep me going the rest of the night. I have worked in the food service industry and I know it can be a pain in the butt to cater to someone to asks for a weird thing when your slammed busy but the bartender hooked me up and kept my coffee refilled as i drank my manhatten. The manhatten I had was done perfectly! Thoroughly enjoyed myself and was pleasently suprised that my bill was so reasonable. Check this place out if youre in the neighborhood. Apparently they have live music too which is an added plus!"}
{"text":"Only rating it a one star for the fact that we left without getting food poisoning. The Philly cheesesteak was among the top worst tasting foods that have ever hit my taste buds, it's advertised as thinly sliced ribeye, and came out something like an overcooked thick piece of pork roast. As far as beverages I ordered a simple glass of water, can't mess that up right? No, I had to order a soda just to get rid of the taste of dish soap that the water had in it. No clue how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Had my wife's 30th birthday party at TAPS. Never had been there before, and my wife and I loved it. Thanks Dave and Jamie!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Great servers.  Went for drinks, some chips n salsa.  All good."}
{"text":"While at the Wigwam Resort, I was faced with a dilemma. I arrived to my room, ready to have room service bring me a burger and some suds. It was not to be, I had called at 10:05 and their room service closes at 10, according to the operator.

She did, however, recommend Taps, which is right across the street, and I'm glad she did. As a new resident of the West Valley, I immediately found my home away from home. A slightly upscale (but not pretentious) atmosphere, great TV's for watching sports (I still have to watch my Colts play!) and delicious food, not to mention a great selection of local/micro brews on tap. Hence the name.

About the food: the BBQ burger was amazing, just juicy enough, perfectly cooked, and with a great BBQ sauce and flavor. The only thing that bothered me was the size of the plate, it was longer than it was wide, similar to a sushi plate, and made it difficult not to make a mess, but I'm picking nits here. The baked Beer Wings were straight OUT OF THIS WORLD, if you love baked/seasoned wings, these are the BEST I've ever had. A foodgasm in every bite. I took a friend here and she raved about them, then ordered another plate. They were all gone in about 5 minutes.

The service is excellent, Dave, Aaron, and Sean are all expert bartenders, and my glass was never empty. They were well-versed in the local brews they carried, and made excellent suggestions for pairings. This is the mark of a true \"gastropub\", which seems to be what they're going for. They had a band the last time I was there, which was really entertaining, but not so loud that you couldn't converse. Just the way I like it.

In short, this place has it all... if you're in the area or staying at the Wigwam, check it out. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the Taps Asada, very flavorful, my husband had the prime rib sandwich and enjoyed it very much. Service was good, attentive, informative, and very accommodating. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very clean, chill atmosphere.  

Would have given it 5 star rating if it had a better selection of beer on hand.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow and disorganized service.  Frustrating.  Lukewarm coffee, difficult to get refills. Once food arrived, order was accurate and food was decent.  Overall, poor service left the impression."}
{"text":"Soulful Sunday

It's loud, it's crowded, it's a very happening scene here on Sunday evenings. The staff works extra hard to keep up with all the drink and food orders. And there's dancing."}
{"text":"Isn't it nice to have a neighborhood place to come and relax, grab a bite and visit with friends.  Actually, that is the start of something great when you add good food and great service.  As usual, I like to hit these places up on a Friday when it should be busy to see how they work under the pressure of a large crowd.  I am glad I did. 

Last night, four of us headed over to check out TAPS.  I have been back in AZ since February and threatening to go here but have not done so until now.  Why did I wait?

For starters, we were met at the table (self seating) by our waitress who got us started with water and a round of drinks.  She was pleasant, very friendly and efficient.  The beer selection is OK and they have a fulll bar so every one was taken care of. 

For food selection, just three of us ate, and one was just there to drink.  We ordered a Chicken Ranch House Salad which was more like a Cobb and exceptionally large.  Lots of great ingredients and more than filling.  Nice!  My other friend ordered an All American Cheese Burger and based on the fact that it was devoured, either the plate was defective or it was quite good....(check box number 2 below!!)  I love a great burger and will try that one next time I go back there.  I chose the 12 NY Hot Wings.....the come in a range of heat levels from 1 through 10.  Since I was not sure how \"HOT\" 10 might have been, I chose #6 as a nice spicy medium point.  Good choice!!  They were meaty and the heat level was hot but not too intense.  Next time I will try a level or two up from there!!  Served with Blue Cheese and Celery on the side they were the perfect meal.  

If there is a down side to this place, its the music.  They have a live band called COPPER SKIES.  Their music was OK at best but nothing to write home about and WAY TOO LOUD for a venue that small.  We finally asked the waitress to have them tune it down a bit so we might have the chance to talk while having our meal. 

All in all it was a good first outing and we will certainly be back.  Whether you are local or a visitor saying a the WigWam Resort across the street, it a very nice place to be any night of the week!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Awesome employees, great drinks, Karaoke.. what more could you want. My husband and I were heading to Buffalo Wild Wings when we realized they were closed.. :( .. we yelped and found this place.. The kitchen was closed when we got there but the crowd and atmosphere of this place was so amazing we stayed all night till we closed the place down. Even got my husband to sing.. lol.. So laid back. A complete mixture of people and all were friendly and talkative. Havent felt so relaxed in a bar atmosphere in a long time. I hear the food is awesome here so I cant wait to get back and try it out! A+ to Taps.. I wish this bar was in Surprise. :)"}
{"text":"Dined at Taps on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm.  There were a few people sitting at the bar and 2 or 3 tables of couples sitting outside.  We were the only table inside.

At first the waitress seemed pretty good.  We ordered 2 iced teas and juices for our kids.  Upon first sip of the iced tea we were instantly turned off....think \"bitter beer face\".  It was gross.  It was almost like it was an instant iced tea mix and NOT freshly brewed.  It was kind of cloudy too.  Yuck!  Saved some money and switched to waters.

Husband and I shared their hot wings which were pretty good.  Not your standard hot wings.  Husband ordered the taco salad which he liked.  I got a salad with romaine hearts that was topped with chopped tomatoes, bacon and green onions and had a gorgonzola dressing on the side.  The presentation of my salad was impressive.  I did wish it would have had more of the tomatoes, bacon and green onions.  There was probably a max amount of 3TB total, divided equally on top of 3 large, vertically standing, cut romaine hearts.  Next time I'll be sure to add a protein to it.  

Now, for the service.  I felt like we were there way too long for how not busy they were and for the amount of waiting we had to do.  Our waitress, altho very nice, was constantly on her cell phone (checking FB I assume?) and chatting with someone in the kitchen area ALL THE TIME.  Now, I wouldn't have quite minded that if we didn't have to wait a long time to say...get refills on our drinks....or get our check...etc.  As time went on and the more waiting we did I got increasingly irritated.  

The last straw was when I paid, the waitress shorted me $0.57 change that was owed back to me.  I brought this up to her attention...mind you....waving at her from across the room didn't get her attention...I had to walk over to HER to address the issue.  What was her response to my saying, \"I paid with a $20 and I was shorted $0.57\"?  She said, \"oh, I thought I put that in there\".  Uh huh.  SURE.  Get your face out of your phone and pay attention to your job.  Gee, I thought I put your tip on the table *eye roll*.

Overall, it's a nice little place.  I'd go back and make sure we had a different waitress to try out more foods."}
{"text":"My wife and I almost always head in the direction of Bell Road for lunch or dinner. Today I decided to head west and south. Saw Taps they were new to this shopping center. 
Taps looks like a sports bar when you enter. Only thing there appears to be only 2 TVs or at least where we were sitting I could only see two both above the bar. The decor is appealing, fresh, lots of light coming in from outside. 
We were seated and very soon offered drinks. When the drinks came to the table we had both decided on their special.  Soup and Salad. With this you get a tomato soup, as much as you want and a choice of several salads again as much as you want. 
Not sure why but lately I have had a hard time getting soup that is hot. The soup came out at somewhere well below the state required 130 degrees. We sent it back asking to warm it up. We got it back it was warmer but still not hot. My wife's salad came out with her soup my salad came out a little later. I got the wedge. My soup and salad was very good. My wife also liked her meal. So the food gets a 4.
The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get the first of our meal to the table. I did order a second different salad as well as did my wife. This also took about 15 min to bring to the table. For what was going to be a quick lunch we were there about an hour. There was only 5 other tables in the place with people at them so the reason for being slow was not that it was crowded. 
The plates bowles they used to serve the food in is extremely small. By the time you had eaten you salad it was all over the table. It is impossible to keep in the small bowel it is served in. If you put the same amount of feed in a larger bowel it would be much better. 

The food was good, the service was not so good. Soup needs to be hot not warm.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Taps.  We had arranged a small get together with some other yelpers to play some board games and the people at Taps were gracious and friendly.  I should also add that the place was empty when we got there though, so we weren't really inconveniencing them.

Anyway, they're menu looks pretty interesting, and it has a decent enough variety to keep everyone happy.  I decided to go with the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  I am so glad that I decided to get that because it was so good!  Lots of lettuce, plenty of bacon, a heart portion of cheese, along with some other good mix-ins topped with a delicious barbecue ranch dressing made this one fantastic salad!  I would definitely order it again.  I also shared the turtle cheesecake with Ashley A. and we pretty much demolished it (it was more me than Ashley.)  

If I were out in Litchfield again, I would definitely consider coming here.  It has a nice laid back atmosphere and the food was great and priced well."}
