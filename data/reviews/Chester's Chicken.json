{"text":"It is an odd set up it just your chicken joint combined with Mexican food and pizza. It is pretty clean and plenty of space. some of their posted menus are out of date and inaccurate. Very truckstop-ish.  The biscuits are old and cold and the macaroni and cheese is certainly not like KFC's. It was old as well, looked like it had been in a warmer for a couple days. Chicken is standard, it's decent. Chicken strips are even better. If you want butter you'll have to ask. For such things like extra ranch you'll have to pay. They have removed the option for two sides with your meal unless you pay extra."}
{"text":"Stopped for gas an early morning heading home from AZ and was hungry so decided to give it a go. Kind of a strange set up, chicken with Mexican food attached to a gas station but meh I've seen weirder. It was early so I didn't think it was a big deal that it was empty. Cashier was very nice and helpful. I had a biscuit which was really good, chicken was good, was too full to try my burrito so idk about that. Its quick and easy."}
{"text":"This place used to be good especially with the previous manager, but since he left this new manager and the employees have a serious attitude now, I love the food here so I keep coming back but I might need to change grab my my food now because of their ridiculous attitude, there drive-through window speaker does not work so you have to drive up to the window. But they don't have any sign up there to pull up to the window, and then when you show up to the window, they have A serious attitude."}
{"text":"Never, ever go here.  Stopped for gas and decided to give the chicken a try.  Bad signs from the beginning.  Empty.  Corn on the cob FRIED along with everything else but hey how could they ruin chicken strips and fries?  Hopped in the car and started to eat on the road.  Raised chicken to eat and it STUNK!  Had to throw everything away and stop for fast food again at a different business.  I think they have been frying everything in the same grease for years and never ever changing it.  YUCK!"}
