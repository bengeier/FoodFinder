{"text":"This place is ALWAYS excellent!  The food is always fresh.  I always receive my money's worth--the serving size allows me to take leftovers with me.  You should try the corned beef!  They cook it themselves.  The soups are made daily.  The burgers are 1/2 pounders!  Where can you get those?  And they're served with real french fries and not the frozen ones.  The daily specials are a great deal.  All the food is home made--no frozen stuff or factory food! Our office uses their catering service all the time and we all love it.  The place is beautiful on the inside and it's super clean.  You will LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"Traveling to Cleveland from San Francisco, found this place via yelp. Unassuming deli with awesome food and great employees. Will be back anytime I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Definitely recommend the Reuben. Salad was fresh. Awesome old time feel, authentic and amazing."}
{"text":"A great place to eat and drink that is walking distance from the Browns' stadium. Sandwiches are made w/ fresh meats, and fries made fresh each day. Have yet to have anything there that I haven't enjoyed. 
Workers are great and you feel at home when you're there.  Very casual which is what I like. Prices for both food and alcohol are very reasonable. 
Give it a try if you've not been there yet!"}
{"text":"Got the Deluxe Italian Wrap (spinach wrap) with Cole slaw. The wrap was great and service quick!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, a loaded sandwich that needed no sauce to taste delicious, and a vibe that was a welcome change for a guy from SoCal. 

All that and competitive pricing for fresh deli sandwiches. Oh did I mention you can have a drink with your lunch?"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Cleveland! Friendly and inviting staff. Burgers were amazing. All of the food was very fresh. Worth the stop. Short walk from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"I ordered the Corned Beef Latkes and it was superb! Just what I needed after a long day at a nearby software conference. Glad I found them."}
{"text":"Longtime Cleveland establishment, off the beaten path. Garlic mayo turkey sandwich hits the spot every time, always served with a side of friendly conversation. Barrister's is a gem!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  Saw all the pics of corned beef, which look really, really good, but wanted to eat something a bit healthier.

They had a huge special board with the top item being a spinach and quinoa salad.  Basically, a Greek salad on spinach with quinoa, onions, cucumbers, chick peas, feta cheese, kalamata olives and a light dressing of some sort.  I was kicking myself in the ass when I saw the perch and pirogies come out of the kitchen, but I'll be damned if the salad wasn't really, really good.  The salad came in a huge bowl and had just the right mix of stuff on the spinach.  Very tasty!

Also included in the lunch was a cup of soup.  I selected the chicken noodle, which was also very good, most certainly home made.

Service was top notch, fast & friendly.  And the whole affair was under $9.00.  Would come back here in a heartbeat.  I'm sure it won't be long before I say to hell with this diet and order a corned beef sandwich with a side of perch of pirogies!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had a Blue Burger, which was cooked and made very well. I ordered the cajun fries, which were handcut and delicious. The other two people I went with enjoyed the food as well. The atmosphere is welcoming and it was a good place to get out of the cold. The staff was incredibly nice as well. Highly recommended if you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery so I can't comment on the restaurant itself.

I have to admit, firstly, that I have a weakness for patty melts. If I had to pick one thing to eat the rest of my life and was actually wasn't so bad for me, I'd pick the patty melt all the time. Even a bad patty melt is good to me.

So, yes, the patty melt was great. The corned beef wrap was amazing. The salad with tuna was middle of the road. Not gross or anything, just not amazing. The fries were pretty good too....probably could have been crispier but not bad."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff, huge portions. Reuben and fries were great. My lunch partner got steak wrap and loved it. Extensive menu choices."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch!!! The food was awesome and the friendly customer service was welcoming. Look forward to our next trip to Cleveland and will definitely stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"I recently used Barristers Deli to caterer a luncheon for our company. My experience was extremely positive. Mary went above and beyond to give me different options and to make sure I was pleased with my order. The quality of the food, presentation, and communication was all above and beyond as well. 10/10 recommend for a lovely catered lunch at your office!"}
{"text":"This is truly the hidden gem I was told about. Service is excellent and very fast.
Several good menu selections. The food is much better than expected. Another dependable place to add to my lunch options."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem.  Fresh delicious food.  Amazing service great selection.  Im typically not adventurous in trying new places but I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"I saw this joint on yelp and thought I would give it a try based on the reviews. After my first visit I have mixed feelings about it. I went to get a lunch special. The service was friendly and nice with the local mom and pap feeling. The deli is clean with a casual atmosphere. I decided to get the jumbo gyro special for $5.49.  It was a large gyro made with a thin pita wrap. The vegetables were fresh and the cucumber yogurt sauce good. The gyro meat on the other hand was cold and rather bland. I was expecting the salty juicy tasty lamb meat off the spit.  It was still eatable but would not recommend it to others. I will not write this place off on just one meal.  I will give it another shot and hope my taste buds are wowed! 
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Barristers!  What to say, my coworkers and I go there about once a week for lunch.  We work in Erieview Tower and sometimes the food court leaves a little to be desired and for a high price.  We can go to Barristers, have amazing service (if you go there more than once, they remember who you are, it's so nice) and get in and out for under 10 dollars.  I love the salami sandwich and handmade pasta salad.  Can't say enough about them."}
{"text":"Very solid option downtown.  The decor is very clean and updated compared to some other downtown diners.  The prices are reasonable and the food was good.  The fries were hot and appeared housemade not frozen (and they gave me a ton of fries, I usually eat all my fries but even I couldn't get through the pile of fries on my platter).  My rueben was very solid.  Would definitely recommend for a classic diner lunch."}
{"text":"I am always on the look out for a great caterer and this is the one! Barrister's. Amazing service, prompt delivery, beautifully packaged and taste wonderful. I ordered 40 sandwich boxes. The portions are generous, fruit salad, potato salad, a cookie and a large sandwich, all I can say, job exceptionally well done. Barrister's Deli is now on my speed dial."}
{"text":"What a great lunch place. The food is fresh, the wait staff is friendly and you get the deli-experience in a better-than-average dining room.  The daily specials are posted on a chalk board by the door. Alongside all the regular sandwich favorites, Be bold and try something different like goose-liver egg-salad or maybe a kosher weiner. Here's the twist-there's a liquor bar as well-extra brownie points!  I've mentally filed this in place to go when a snowfall hits during rush hour and the inner-belt is impassable. C'mon you downtown office workers-get some lunch grub here for a buck or two less than those other spots on the main drags."}
{"text":"Quick and basic diner food. Service is friendly and the kitchen can make almost any substitutions you want but the food itself left me wishing I had gone elsewhere. My  sister who works nearby swears by it and picks up lunch from here almost daily. 

The chicken pita looked delicious and my sister informed me that you have to ask for the pita to be included. Weird right, when pita is literally in the name but whatever. I ended up with the chicken ceasar wrap and chips and I was expecting a creamy dressing, croutons and lots of cheese. Instead I got flavorless chicken, an oily almost Italian like dressing and tons of olives. It was not what I'm used to and I didn't really enjoy it. 

Overall I probably won't be back but can see why locals and ppl who work around here like it."}
{"text":"Great diamond in rough has been around a very long time. Went for lunch with five co-workers and had little time. This place has been around they know most people are coming on lunch  and need to get in and out. Don't miss the specials on the board when you walk in. Have been coming for past four to five years on occasion and have never had a bad meal.  Don't expect anything over the top just good bar/ diner food.  I don't usually do  fries but I have to admit they are good . I had the grilled chicken Caesar salad came in an oversized bowl with plenty of chicken and a very good Caesar dressing."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch because it's fast and delicious! Prices are great, and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Great sandwiches, fries were bomb, coffee was delicious and best of all the nicest service from the owners! The restaurant is cutely decorated and we were able to eat and pay quickly. It's clean and the menu is perfectly straightforward! All around it's an awesome reasonably priced experience!"}
{"text":"This no frills diner is pure Cleveland!  Great specials, excellent food, and everything is homemade.  Very reasonable prices and liquor license with full bar as well.  Short walk from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Science Center, and Browns Stadium.  It's been around for a long time, and I would be shocked if it's not around for many years to come.  I've been coming here for lunch a few times a month for years.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped hee for a Lenten Friday fish lunch special and the food was pretty good. Service was very pleasant and I'd come back again. Fish was prorated well and the pierogies were local, but a bit dry.  There were as few other menu items I look forward to trying. There is a deli and the meats appeared to be high quality."}
{"text":"From outta town, found this place and gave it a try. Got the cheeseburger and Cajun fries and they were awesome! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Barristers for lunch today with my coworker, per his suggestion. Today, I ordered the chicken stir fry lunch special, which came with soup or salad. I opted for cheddar broccoli soup, and it tasted fresh and delicious. My coworker ordered a Reuben with onion rings. A few minutes later, our lunches were served. My coworker's onion rings were large and they looked tasty. He said they were very good, despite being of the frozen/packaged variety. He also said his Reuben was very tasty. 

My chicken stir fry was excellent! The chicken was fresh, teriyaki flavored, and was cooked perfectly. The veggies were also fresh, crispy, and delicious. The portion was large and I would order this dish again. The service was very friendly.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"We yelped this deli after visiting rock roll museum. What a great meal and wonderful people who are so old school heartwarming . We had corn beef sandwiched between potato pancakes . Don't miss this local favorite for a bite to eat"}
