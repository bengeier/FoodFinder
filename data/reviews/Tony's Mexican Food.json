{"text":"I love this place! Such good Mexican food and and incredible prices. Yesterday I had an al pastor torta and an al pastor taco so good, just the right amount of kick. I would give this place a 5 star but their chips are not fresh made and can be stale, the salsa on the other hand is amazing!"}
{"text":"I am on a never ending quest to find the perfect tacos al pastor and today I have a new #1 pick! Tony s Steet tacos al pastor are a prefect blend of flavor, sauce and spices. I ordered to go so can't say much about the service and drinks yet but I will soon. The counter clerk was very nice and my food was ready fast. I can't wait to try more from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Will never return. Showed up with a party of 5 and a 2 year old. We asked for a bottle of water for the baby three times and never received it. 45 mins later I had to find someone and wait for them to give me a Dasani. My party asked for margaritas, we were told they don't see anything but the original lime Rita and frozen and on the rocks. Ok, fine. The 2 servers barely spoke English. We asked what tequila they had for the Rita's and they had no idea. Frozen Rita's were like shaved ice with lime flavor. Both frozen and rocks tasted like straight sour mix with some lime. Could not taste even a hint of tequila. Funny thing was they don't even have a bar so where were these Rita's coming from. Don't waste your time getting the soft tacos as they are a joke. I have never in my life seen a taco so small. We ordered guacamole and it looked like a weird paste, nothing like what we have ever received anywhere else. We asked for an extra order of bean dip and chips, she brought us out just the dip and told us we already had chips. But we ordered a second order so that didn't make sense.  None of us finished our meals due to such poor quality of the food. The baby's quesadilla looked like plastic. Absolutely disgusting. We paid our bill and went somewhere else for margaritas and dessert. Should have known when we walked in and nobody was there at dinner time it was not going to be great but every place deserves a chance but they will not receive a second chance."}
{"text":"Love this place, the asada torta is my favorite. The service is so quick and very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There are places better but five stars because it's as good as can be for what they offer. Cheap delicious straight forward Mexican food. Their wet burritos are amazing. Haven't had anything there I didn't really enjoy. The service and food hasn't disappointed at all. And for the price it can't be beat"}
{"text":"I love the food here and the waitress is always so nice. I got the Carne Asada plate and my husband got chicken enchiladas. The food was fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. I never write reviews but this place does not get enough creek for how good it really is. The service is great everyone is friendly and checks on you and the food is so tasty. I had a wet birria burrito , it was so delicious and full of flavor. I wanna go back soon. Even the chips and salsa are good. I recommend coming here for a real Mexican dish."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Hands down best Mexican restaurant in town! Great service and great food what more can you ask for. 

must have:
Chips and salsa
Pastor quesadilla"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and look forward to each visit! We have never had a bad experience here ever! The food is always delicious and freshly prepared.  There is a wonderful older lady who works there and she is always smiling and happy; it's always a pleasure to see her...she makes you feel very welcome.  The prices here are very reasonable and they have daily specials as well.  Whether you're dining in or getting take out, you will not be disappointed!  We recommend the carnita soft tacos or carnita plate...absolutely delicious!  Try the flan for dessert and you will be thoroughly pleased!  We definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome asada! Love this place! Super cheap pricing too. Can't go wrong :) I ordered 10 asada tacos and the asada combo plate. I loved everything but the tacos were perfectly seasoned and marinated. I just want more and more!!"}
{"text":"Beyond great food very very authentic. Friendly service prices are good. We came all the way from the east part of town because we heard about this place and we will be back very very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome place been many times over the years. I have tried everything and never a complaint.  Try the wet tongue burrito it's too die for."}
{"text":"Even if I am just getting home from a long Mexico trip I won't hesitate to go straight to Tony's. The Chorizo breakfast burrito has been a life saver sometimes. The staff is always very friendly and genuinely cares about your experience. Great food, great beer, at a great price point."}
{"text":"Good food...every authentic tasteing...no refills on the chips only downside to establishment"}
{"text":"Discovered this place while driving by - we were actually on our way to another Mexican restaurant, and decided to give this a try...wrong choice for sure.

The restaurant had very few customers. Several waitresses - ours came to our table soon after we were seated with a small oblong basket of chips, and a small bowl of salsa at one end of the basket - in other words, the basket was not full.   We also were given menus.  Several pages of choices. I didn't see any salads listed.

Either it was the waitresses first day on the job (first table ever), or she was not entirely there.  We ordered a beer each - MGD as listed on the menu...Didn't have it. Once we settled on Corona and were served, we were ready to place our order.  

The Mr. ordered the combo place of 3 enchiladas, beef.  The menu said 'shred beef', which apparently confused the waitress when I said 'shredded beef'.  She asked Mr. 4 times what kind of meat he wanted..then pointed to the menu and directly at the 'shred beef'...this was a couple of minute ordeal...she was totally confused.


Our food came out pretty fast and I am pretty sure it was all microwaved.  The rice and beans = meh.   The enchiladas were skimpy and looked dried out. I ordered chicken fajitas. The fajitas seemed to have been cooked yesterday. Very dry, no grill coloring, no flavor.  I could not eat them without salsa.  They didn't resemble or taste like any fajitas I have ever had before...and I've eaten many fajita plates...I'm from SoCal and good Mexican is every where.

The chips and salsa - chips were ok. The salsa was edible but not authentic.  Mr. had to go to the counter and ask for more chips and salsa as the watiress never came back.

When the bill came - it was a cash register receipt with a list of charges. Nothing was itemized.  The waitress charged us for chips and salsa and extra salsa which was necessary in order to eat the fajitas as they were so dry.

All in all, this was one of the most disappointing meals, the worse Mexican food, and the poorest service we have experienced in Las Vegas. 

For the Enchilda plate, Chicken fajitas, 3 beers and chips and salsa, our bill was $37.77 - way too much for what we received.  My husband wanted to stop and eat on our way home."}
{"text":"I have eaten Mexican food from coast to coast and actually lived and worked in Mexico for a while and I can ASSURE you If you like Robertos you will probably hate this restaurant.  If you like Robertos you have an anglo palate , which is fine , but i'll venture a guess you prefer Panda Express to China Town restaurants and Pizza Hut to a real Italian Pie .. I digress.

Tony's is real Mexican food .  Portions are good sized and prices are reasonable . As with any restaurant they will have their specialties, if you are not going to order their specialties then the taste might be a bit off.  I always ask the staff what is good here when I am new to a restaurant .

If you asked me what's good there I'd tell you 

Chile relleno 
Carne Asada Fries
Flautas dinner
and Carnits Burrito slathered in their green sauce ! 

their beans are very good as a side dish as well

So please ignore the Robertos fans and give this place a try .  it's not my favorite mexican restaurant but It's very good !"}
{"text":"Went about 1:00pm. Nobody in the joint but us, same when we left. It was clean, staff was very nice. When trying a new Mex restaurant, I always order the carne asada tacos. If they can't get that right, then they won't get anything right. Had 2 carne asada tacos, wife had chicken enchiladas combo. Carne asada was average, chicken enchiladas had no flavor, the rice and beans were spot on. Go figure. If you want rice and beans, this is your place. Thought combo plate was a tad pricey."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. A must try if you are in the mood for Mexican food.
The prices are also lower than the competition."}
{"text":"I really hate going to a restaurant, really liking the food and then having to trash them for something other than the food.. I had the chicken enchilada combo, it was great. The portions were good, the sauce was yummy and the chicken was seasoned well. 

So we eat and get the check when my friend notices an extra charge on there for $1.50. After combing over the bill we are perplexed at what that charge is for, so we ask the waitress. Well apparently a second helping of chips and salsa in not free at Tony's. WTF?

Why this REALLY irritates me is three-fold. First  if you are served chips and salsa without asking when you sit down at the table, it sets the precedence that chips and salsa are complimentary. I mean pretty much every Mexican Restaurant does it these days so its not a far stretch to assume this. Second. the waitress did not mention there was an extra charge for a second helping. That would have been nice. Duh!  Finally the serving of chips and salsa we were served was minuscule. At a $1.50 we were overcharged for the portion, I am sure their cost was something like 7 cents.

That leaves me to feel like they pulled a bait and switch. Too bad, I really liked my lunch. The hair-brained policy of charging for small portions of chips and salsa cost you a star and you lose another for the waitress not saying anything to our party about it."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart, to have to write this review. I've  been frequenting  this place for the last 3 years, I usually come 4 to 5 times per month. 

The service and food are excellent I usually order the \"Chilaquiles Rojo\" with a piece  of \"Steak\" on top. I first noticed, that the portion of the chilaqiles and steak kept on getting smaller through the time. Now it seems that I am ordering a plate of \"Rice, Beans and a side of Chilaqiles\". I stopped ordering the steak on top about 3 moths ago. Now they started to charge for extra drinks (they no longer offer \"Free refills\"), in fact, they don't offer refills at all. Now you have to purchase a new drink every time. However, when you order a new one the refill the same cup and charge you the full price of a drink. I understand the fact of saving, however, as the portions kept on decreasing, the prices continue to increase. For that reason alone, I have to give them 2 stars.

Now don't get me wrong, I will continue to come here, just not as frequent as I use to."}
{"text":"Visited Tony's for the first time. Nice people, clean restaurant and good food. 

Ordered one pastor and three chicken tacos. All come prepared with the usual toppings including salsa. The chicken was all shredded white meat. Very tender, but not over the top on flavor. The pastor was amazing. The texture was more of a stew then spit-grilled. Had amazing flavor and practically melted in my mouth.  

It's worth noting that there is no salsa bar. Normally this would bother me, but the salsa (pico de gallo I should say) they serve the tacos with is very tasty.

Watched tv while I ate. Also watched somebody get busted in the parking lot. Added to the ambiance for sure.  

The chicken, while good, was not amazing hence the four stars. Other than that, go for it!

Oh, before I forget, the prices are really good. The tacos are $1.50 a pop. Don't forget to hit the tip jar!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was the fastest serving of food I've ever experienced. I had my enchiladas faster than one can say \"chimichanga\". So an A+ for service. Food was good. Can't complain. Not outstanding but it was good. I cleaned my plate. I'd recommend this place if you are in the mood for Mexican. Ambiance is a bit blah."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst food I have ever had in a restaurant.  The microwave was the hardest working thing  in the place. Everything was microwaved and very bland, no flavor at all. Service was just as bad. Argued with us and insisted the food was authentic me ican. Far from it. Not one person on party of four was happy with our food yet they insisted on charging us for our drinks. Just a horrible experience all around. Will never go back and will not recommend to any one. The only reason they are getting one star is because  I have to."}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot!!!!! Been here a few times have ordered different things (my boyfriend and I) and have all exceeded our expectations :) Service is great and speedy. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Junk! Hardly any chicken in taco or burrito ..burrito was full of beans and rice and barely any chicken! Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Im so sad I moved to oregon because the food here is amazing! Im currently visiting with family here and brought my mom in, its her new favorite for mexican food. 
The portion sizes are good (we both took home leftovers) the plating is beautiful, everything cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients. The staff are so friendly sociable!"}
{"text":"I come here often... good food authentic
Lunches get a little busy expect a small wait
Good lunch specials,kids enjoy the bean and cheese burritos"}
{"text":"Been going to Tony's for years. Staff is friendly, service is fast, food is good. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my hubby for a quick bite. We each got a Michelada & they were really good. Great mixed with a modelo. We both got some pastor soft tacos which were tasty. We also got the chicken soft tacos, and we didn't like that very much. There was no flavor and the chicken meat was so mushy I barely could chew it. I also asked for the guacamole on the side but instead, they drenched my tacos in it and I didn't like that.... but I enjoyed the michelada the most"}
{"text":"Ma' and Pa' taco shop. I ordered two asada burritos without rice to go.  That's grilled skirt steak for my English speaking friends.  They where wrapped nice and fat,  with beans and Pico de gallo.  I also got the  Chicken salad.  It was a bed of iceberg lettuce a couple slivers of tomato and radishes with lots of chopped grilled Chicken breast.  All in all very fresh and good."}
{"text":"Very good food, I think it's  better than Roberto's Taco shop Mexican food"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican food fix.  I liked the spicy salsa that was brought out before the dish was served.  Nothing amazing, but for the typical southwestern US Mexican food menu, the quality was good.

Would definitely get more stars if the chips were oven baked and the quacamole was more chunky style, instead of thin and creamy.  Some people like that I guess.

They advertise pozole and menudo every Sabado y Domingo!  I may have to venture back for a little pozole and hopefully update my review!"}
{"text":"The people here seem to care about what they are doing. Better than Robertos, the food is delish, and has some class to it but don't recommend for date nights. Very authentic Mexican food. The Wall art is really cool."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! Really tasty chilaquiles.  My wife and I go here at least once every week or two."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco spots in vegas! This carne asada is so delicious! Such a hidden gem. For about $1.50/2 a taco you can't beat it! Stop by and check it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Im sorry but just was not impressed with the food. I read most of the positive reviews and was all set for a great lunch.
I had to ask for chips and salsa, whats up with that?
I had three soft tacos rice and beans. All bland by my standards.
Service was quick and place looked clean.
I ordered a small guacamole and it was served in a small bowl with a spoon. It was runny like soup. Yikes...."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch...nice room and very good service. I had the carnitas (sp) special. Excellent. My wife ordered carne asada street taco's...fantastic. The chips were fesh and the salsa was hot. We have been here once before and had a very nice experience then also. BTW the horchata was good too. Did I mention the good service?"}
{"text":"Tony's is a great Mexican restaurant. The people are very friendly and the food is amazing. I had the drunken shrimp and that was a good choice and my friend had the carne asada tacos. Both entrees were a great choice. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Carne asada anything is to die for.  We come here weekly and my go to its the Carne asada wet burrito with enchilada sauce. The fideo soup is always a must as well!

The service is ALWAYS friendly and the prices are excellent!"}
{"text":"The place is small and seemed a bit damp. I really wanted some Mexican food and it had some good reviews, so I tried it. The wet green chicken burrito was great. I could of had a refill on the soda and maybe some more chips and salsa, but the staff can be blamed for that. I might try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is pretty authentic stuff on this side of town.  I usually have to go all the way on the east side to tacos del gordo for some descent Mexican food.  But this place is a hidden gem in spring valley.  The food is flavorful and tastes amazing.  Whenever I'm craving Mexican this is my go to.  The service is nice, it takes a while, but worth the wait. This is definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"Despite their building signage looking near identical to Tony Roma's ... this is actually an authentic Mexican restaurant. The inside is pretty small and not very staffed. Came for dinner and our server was attentive for being the only one working. You get a complimentary basket of chips and salsa which actually is perfect so I do not end up eating 7 baskets of chips before my meal. The salsa was hot and seemed homemade. I ordered chicken fajitas for main course, ~$11 which is inexpensive for fajitas. They were well seasoned, and the rice that came with it was also good. The meal came with soup and tortillas as well. Definitely left full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by Tony's! After trying numerous Mexican restaurants in the Vegas area and being disappointed by most this was a delicious find! Sampled many tacos and all were exceptional. Will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible during dinner. Thy made my food incorrectly and after 3 bites I asked to politely fix it without anything extra. They told me I have to pay for my food again even though the cook messed up my order. I recommend other mexican food places near by; a place that values customer service and don't blame the customer for the cooks fault for not reading the ticket."}
{"text":"The food is decent. They charge resturant prices when this is a taco shop. I would come more often if they didn't charge you up for everything and actually include the condiments."}
{"text":"Tony's is a great little mom and pop restaurant. It's family owned, owners are super nice. Most Mexicans restaurants taste pretty much the same if you order carne asada burritos or cheese enchiladas. You have to venture to find the good stuff. Their fried shredded beef tacos are amazing. Not too greasy with Mexican cheese and peppers on top. So addictive. Also their chile verde burrito is very tasty."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Food and service is fantastic. Some of the best home cooked Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"The low score isn't for the food. It gets 4 stars. The service from my cashier, 5 stars. Very helpful. The cook/manager flat refused to make a substitution of the meat on an order of nachos. Not closing time, only one other customer in the restaurant. Her response was \"no\". Offered to pay difference if there was a cost difference. Still no. It wasn't for something unusual , just something other than carne asade. So it's time to find a restaurant that can make carnitas or chili verde nachos because you won't get them or anything special at Tony's."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Ive been coming here for 16 years and never had a bad meal.  Great food great service and fair prices."}
{"text":"Service was nice and quick, however, food was horrible, all of it, and no we didn't eat it..."}
{"text":"Best \"fast\" Mexican food in Las Vegas. The tacos are my favorite. Everything seems to be authentic, and very fresh. 
chips and salsa are delicious especially the SALSA!"}
{"text":"my issue here is not the food its the service. i have been here 3 times and each time it has gotten worse. The 1st time I went everything was fine and I enjoyed the food. The 2nd time I went I wanted to get a pound of meat with the broth that it gets cooked in which they stated that I was not able to get the broth. After speaking with the kitchen and getting approval they were able to give me what I wanted however when I asked for the dinner special the cashier turned to me and said it's past 7 o'clock the special no longer is valid the time with 702pm I had arrived at the restaurant at 6:45 p.m. This 3rd and last time was the deal breaker we came in to buy a pound of meat and it was listed on the menu when we asked about it she said it was no longer available but we could buy the dinner plate the dinner play and the pound of meat  were the same price except for the dinner plate you would get half of the amount of meat. Over all i enjoyed the meals that I've had there but I'm sick and tired of the service and lack of customer service I will not be returning and I would not suggest for you to go there"}
{"text":"Food's good but they charge you a \"service fee\" for using a credit card which is annoying. Otherwise best hard shell tacos I've had... Really! Hard shells are really light and thin but crispy. Very tasty. Pork is best. Lunch specials are pretty good,. Always check to see what the lunch special is. Haven't had anything there I didn't like."}
{"text":"Awesome chili rellenos...possibly the best in town!!!  I prefer them covered in their green sauce.  Great home made chips and salsa also- though be warned that they do charge for add'l baskets of chips.  Great service!  Never crowded unfortunately. Very casual atmosphere but a step up from quick food as they do wait on you."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING....the food is fresh and delish...service is great.. Reasonably priced.  This is that Mexican food from Cali! When we moved to Vegas we could only find seafood only Mexican food we finally found a place that serves real Cali Mexican food... Everything we have had has been AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service.  I had Carne Asada taco with bears and rice.  I liked it and thought it was good and authentic Mexican food.  My friend and my husband wanted theirs to be spicier. She had pork and I can't remember what my husband ate.  The place is clean and brightly lit,  and easy to find."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try as it was close to home.  Chili Relleno was awful, mostly beans and rice inside.  Red sauce was greasy and tasteless.  Place did not feel very clean, one of the pre-rolled silverware set they gave us was dirty inside.  Server was pleasant, but the food left a lot to be desired.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Everything is good!!!! Have been coming here for years. Love it! Wet burrito in green sauce is the best."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to try this place with how it looked on the outside and the name of the place did not seem too reassuring that it would be good but I was actually pleasantly surprised with the place. I ordered the enchiladas and they were delicious! The chips and salsa they served at the table were great too. I did not think this place was a sit down restaurant by how it presented itself on the outside of the building. Only reason I'm knocking off a star is cause my stomach didn't agree with me later but that will not prevent me from coming back in the future."}
{"text":"We tried this place several times and the food is just average. However, it's like pulling teeth if you order food to take back to your office and you ask for a few extra salsas! My gosh, you'd think they'd understand how one tiny little cup of salsa does not go a long way with a huge burrito or tons of chips. Salsa is not expensive to make guys, I make it all the time...so why be so stingy when customers want more salsa???!!! Also when I asked to bag the separate bags I was looked at by the waitress behind the cash register like I had six eyes..
What...you can't bag the orders for our whole office so we can have them organized???? Don't think plastic bags are going to hurt your revenue now. We definitely won't be going back here, especially when a bad attitude is exuded towards \"good\" paying neighbor customers."}
{"text":"Really good food at a good price! Have eaten here several times recommended by a relative who also loves the place. I have had breakfast and lunch both. Several menu items to choose from but I normally get burritos, guacamole and nachos. Family owned and operated. Chips and salsa is yummy."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in this town. Service is great and staff very friendly. Been here a few times and they never disappoint.  Wish I would've found this place sooner."}
{"text":"Limit me on my green sauces and one star. The battle to get the green sauce! It's the ketchup to burritos! And they will only give me one. What we get for trying to support smaller mom and pops shops. Back to Roberto's. Terrible havent even tasted my food. But first and last time coming."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now and the food is great and consistent.  A nice variety on menu.  I always go for the delish and crispy chimichanga and the shrimp cocktail my favs! Friendly service..  Eat greedy, yours truly.. Mizz loveli"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim and my wife loved it a lot. Well worth it for sure. She was in love with the food and would go back."}
{"text":"The most amazing Mexican food ever! I am there every Sunday. Carne Asada fries & wet chile verde burrito are to die for Oh-Em-Gee. Fast & friendly service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The carne Asada tacos are superb and the shrimp cocktails are bangin'. I've never had anything less than authentic at Tony's and I'm a Mexican food fiend!"}
{"text":"All the food is really good! and the service is great! The prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food! I dont know what there is not to like I was shocked about the bad reviews I have tried my fair share of mexican resturants and this one is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Tried the enchiladas, flautas and burrito. All of the food was tasty. Great value for the money and the people were friendly and helpful. Asada burrito was a good size and the spicy red sauce was delicious with just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Although not fancy, Tony's has some of the best Mexican food in Vegas.  Freshly made and consistantly good.  My office eats here once a week."}
{"text":"Awesome food, bad service. I stopped by yesterday to grab a to go order the food is really tasty and authentic. I enjoyed it so much I stopped by tonight with my boyfriend. We ordered carne Asada fries for our starter along with 2 alcoholic beverages and 2 waters. We got our alcoholic drinks but had to ask again for water. And even then she only ever brought us one water for the 2 of us. . Whatever. Our waitress came back and we ordered our food. I ordered first and after i was done she was walking away to leave. My boyfriend had to get her attention to come back to order his dinner. Apparently she thought the Asada fries were his dinner lol. After we finally ordered we ate the chips and salsa. Very small amount. Tasty but never was offered a refill. Our dinner came super quick which was nice, except for the fact we still hadn't got the Asada fries that we ordered right when we got there. Mid into our dinner we finally got the fries. Food is yummy a step above having Roberto's or don tortaco. But I guess I will stick to just to go orders."}
{"text":"I was meadow's mall and my family was hungry and we decided to grab something really quick. FYI - Meadows mall is across the street from spring preserves. I was really shocked how well these little tacos tasted.
I ordered 12 Tacos, Carnitas (pulled pork) with cheese and guacamole.
The tacos had diced onions and cilantro, just squeeze the lime and ... WOW dam good for mall food. I am not sure i would drive all the way from Henderson to get a Taco, I would think about it though :) ... I think the gas in Chevy Tahoe would cost more the meal. If your at this mall for some reason give it a try. I think i should have ordered 4 more. The 12 tacos was shared by 4. The tacos it self is only $1.25 and to add cheese .25 cents and guacamole another .25 cents. Man just writing this review wants me to sneak off from work and grab a bite."}
{"text":"I saw the other reviews and thought - I'll try it- I came for lunch - first of all the loud obnoxious television was too much - stupid games shows in Spanish - you just can't get away from it- forget conversations with friends - terrible decor and the service was bad - part of my lunch order was with chips and salsa - never got it - the beer arrived after the tacos - NOT what the other reviews said at all!  Won't be back - try somewhere else - the carne asada tasted tainted and really after everything else??  Plus it is 103 degrees outside and no a/c and no ceiling fans turned on!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tony about a year ago and my life has never been the same. Now a dietary staple, the shredded beef burrito with the spicy red sauce is my happy place. I have tried a handful of other items that are tasty, but nothing compares to that burrito. 

Tip : whatever you get, throw the spicy red sauce on there. Churros included."}
{"text":"I ordered 4 plates To Go and they said they had to charge me for more than 2 tiny containers of salsa! They give more than that for free when you eat there. I won't be coming back.

FYI - quite possibly the worst chimichanga I've ever had. This was $10.49 and all it has is carnitas (which was supposed to be shredded beef) and beans. It's dry and disgusting. I wish I hadn't wasted my time coming here."}
{"text":"Always loved the food here. And they open at 8 AM every day. Big selection of different foods. Clean intetior.  Quick & attentive service.  And good daily specials."}
{"text":"I've lived on this side of town since 2006. This place has to be a front for illegal activities.  There are never any cars parked there that it is amazing it stays in business. I get that this city was built on and flourished through corruption but I'm in awe how the police look the other way in the face of blatant crime. So sad. The food must be terrible if they serve any."}
{"text":"I have driven past Tony's for almost 2 years. In fact, each time we pass it we have joked about the name, because Tony sounds more of an Italian joint. So my family says \"Tony's Mexican food\" with an Italian accent. Yesterday, my husband suggested we try it. I'm open minded, why not? The only thing I expected from this place, was to order at the counter and get some fast-casual Mexican food. I thought it would be like Roberto's Tacos, which I've tried once and never been back. I was shocked to see tables and booths, then be greeted by a nicely dressed young man. We could sit wherever we wanted. Then were handed the menus. 

Then a woman came to take our drink order. They have all kinds of Margaritas, Coke products, and HORCHATA & JAMAICA! Since I'm doing the Low Carb/Keto life (even though I planned to cheat here), I went with their Unsweetened Iced Tea with lemon. It was smooth tasting. Then they brought chips and salsa. That salsa has a kick!!! It was very good! Even the tortilla chips were good!  

Here is what many reviewers don't understand. This is a mom and pop, authentic restaurant. If you've ever been anywhere in Latin America and eaten at a local restaurant, you get the same service and food. In fact, I heard a different woman's voice in the kitchen, so it's possible to assume that an Abuela/Grandma or Tía is making the food! The Menu is both in Spanish and English. They have food like Lengua (Tongue), Birria, Sopes, Ceviche, and a BUNCH of other authentic dishes! This is not Americanized food!! And with that, let me just tell you that their Soft Tacos are actually reasonably priced at $1.99!!!! This is the ONLY joint that has 1 small street taco for $2. I've been to Me Gusta Tacos and they charge $3.50 for 1 taco. Other places charge more, for 1 taco!!! Those street tacos should really be $1 each! But...I understand the need to make a profit. $1.99 is far more reasonable than $3.50! And my Carne Asada tacos were ON POINT! 

One thing I love about this place, is they serve Breakfast ALL DAY!!! so I got Huevos Divorciados (Divorced Eggs). Which are 2 eggs with a red and green salsa (see photo). Because I'm on that Ketogenic/Low Carb life, my only cheat were the tortillas. The breakfast plate by default is served with Beans and Rice, However I asked for Bacon instead and asked for Guacamole on the side. I was charged for Bacon, but it's all good. I also ordered 3 Carne Asada soft tacos \"with everything.\" My husband got the Carnitas plate and a Chile Relleno on the side. 

My tacos were so much better than I expected!! Tons of flavor! Perhaps not the greatest quality meat, but these are akin to street tacos from a legit taco truck- except better! I got SO FULL, SO QUICKLY that I took home 1 taco. I forced myself to finish the guacamole (probably because we went through 2 baskets of chips and salsa). 

My husband loved the Chile Relleno!!!! And he was impressed with the Carnitas dish! As was I when I tried it! He too (he's a BIG guy) couldn't finish the Chile Relleno or his dish! 

And, unless you know what I mean by \"authentic,\" you won't understand my next statement. Even the plates they used, was totally authentic! Meaning, they were cheap plates that you've eaten off of in Latin America. I loved it! The food felt, looked, and tasted like my Tía or Abuelita made it! 

I was blown away! I did not expect this. The prices were right. If you want a fancier, more expensive place you can go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas. It's Americanized but good food. But if you want an authentic experience....this place is it. As far as service goes, our cups were never empty. The female server spoke English well but you can detect an accent. 

Since we live so close to Tony's, I'm sorry it took us so long to eat here and I have thanked my husband for picking that place to try. We are both, so impressed... probably because we misjudged the place and didn't have high expectations when we walked in. 

Bottom line: want some authentic Mexican food, with an authentic experience? Come here. Want an Americanized, overpriced, higher overhead food? Go elsewhere. But you've got to try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"Went to Tonys for a short business meeting with my future catering partners this afternoon. They've raved about the food and insisted I try it. It was my first time there. We ordered guacamole and bean dip, both excellent, guacamole was freshly made. I reluctantly ordered carnitas to go and they were the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. I'm a very picky chef and they were just right, not dried out or greasy! I'll be stopping back there again very soon! Thank you !!"}
{"text":"Decent food decent prices. Super friendly staff. Clean restaurant. I had the carnitas and el pastor tacos. They were good, but nothing to write home about. Their plates looked delicious though and I overheard two tables say how much they loved their meals. It is warm, not hot, but warm inside. I was comfortable in shorts and a tshirt."}
{"text":"This place was actually REALLY delicious. Had a nice giant glass of horchata (so sweet and delicious), 2 enchilada platter, flan (perfect texture, not slimy like some can be), and chips & salsa for only $15! All so filling & delicious, plus the staff is really sweet, will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"When I'm in town visiting, I have to stop here! Best chilaquiles EVER! Get the green sauce, trust me! Rice and beans are delicious, too!"}
{"text":"We typically order the carne asada burritos and tacos from here which are ok to me but my husband likes them. I find their burritos to have an intense amount of salt but hey, at least it has flavor. 

Yesterday, I ordered myself menudo with hominy beans and the hubby 4 tacos which wouldn't feel up a 3 year old but he considers it a snack. 

I have been craving menudo forever but there a very few places who add hominy these days so I was excited to find out they do. 

It came with limes, the lil spices (no chili flakes) and some tortillas.  it had no flavor. None. It wasn't spicy at all, needed something and there wasn't enough lime to even try. So disappointed. 

It's safe to say that craving subsided quickly"}
{"text":"Food was lack luster at best. The service was terrible! Waitress took our order then proceeded to mop the dining room floor and then go back to bring us our food YUCK!!"}
{"text":"Very good food that was served quickly. Ordered chicken quesadilla, lengua taco, pastor taco, and a chimichanga followed by churro a with ice cream. All super delicious. Great chips and salsa as well."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area so we tried it. It was not very good. They had soft shell shrimp tacos but the server called the supervisor to see if she could serve a hard shell taco with shrimp. No! No? WTF? I got a soft one. The taco was skimpy and boring. Too bad. My husband didn't finish his meal either. I'll drive the extra 2 miles to have Frank and Finas at Flamingo and Grand Canyon from now on."}
{"text":"Food is very good here, absolutely no complaining on my end the portion size was perfect and the price was awesome... I had the marinated beef burrito and it tasted amazing.. Defiantly recommend stoping by and trying this food"}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant from Yelp, best Mexican Food ever, We tried the eggs and steak, green chilaquiles and Bacon omelette, the taste, the flavor, the sauce, even the beans were delicious!!!! Keep this quality please....and let's support this kind of restaurant with real Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"If you want tacos for lunch that are real and not from, \"Taco Hell\", this is the place to go!  Small, comfortable, quiet, and excellent tacos.  The lunch carne asado tacos are the bomb!  They are pretty fast too so you don't have to worry about your time being sucked up waiting for your food during a busy lunch.  The only reason they lost a star for me was the flan.  It was overcooked and too hard.  If they can perfect the flan, it would have been a perfect visit!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on southwest side A+++, prices are low and affordable. I really recommend this place"}
{"text":"This review is only of a quick stop for a Torta. 

When I drove by this place on the way to Wet and Wild, I thought, \"Hey, am I in San Diego? This place looks great!\" I walked in and thought the same. I ordered a Chicken Torta as a quick snack. $7.50 later I thought differently. 

The place looks great. And clean. Service was friendly and quick. Price was too high. The Torta had absolutely zero flavor. Even after they charged me an extra $.50 for a jalepeno (on the side). 

The hot sauce that came with the sandwich was flavorless as well. Bummer. 

I am not a Torta connoisseur. I am not that picky when it comes to Tortas. But this one sucked. 

Waste of 7 bucks and 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food. Fresh ingredients, awesome platters, quick service and amazing prices.  It's the kind of a place you want around the corner."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food that tastes fresh and homemade.  The chips and salsa were the only thing that wasn't good at all. Tasted like it was out of a bottle from the grocery store 
I ordered a bean and cheese sope with guacamole and sour cream and it was tasty. A bit on the crunchy side but  was flavorful. I also ordered the chile relleno with rice and beans and was Mmmmmming after every bite. The chile was stuffed with ooey gooey melty cheese. The rice and beans had great flavor which is rare.  Most Mexican restaurants serve bland flavorless rice so this was a nice surprise. My hubby enjoyed his chimichanga as well. 

The restaurant is not fancy at all but the service was fast and our waitress was a real sweetheart. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Tasty Birria beef tacos! All I ever get and I love it. There's service with a couple of cashiers acting as waiters. Never had a bad taco. You can grab a beer and eat chips and tacos without breaking the bank like if you were going to a cantina. They're quick and will refill your sodas and water and bring tons of lime!"}
{"text":"This place is very close to where we work so the guys and I decided to check this place out.  Our first impressions was this was an upscale Roberto's.

The place was nice and clean and the service was fast 9/10.  My water cup was always filled.  The food was a 5/10.  My flower tortilla was a little hard - I ordered the Steak / Onions with Beans and rice.  

What really got me was when I got my check and we were charged $1.50 for extra chips and salsa.  We expected this to be on par with other Mexican restaurants that serve this GRATIS!  (FREE)

This brought my review from a 3 star to a 2 star.

Maybe we'll give this place another try after a few weeks.  We'll know better than to ask for extra chips however.  My last impression on this place was for the check.  It turned out to be about $40 after tip for a meal of three people. Kind of high in my opinion for the caliber of food we had.

Another Note:
They do not accept Restaurant.com Coupons anymore as of August 1, 2010."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. Service was friendly and fast....we had Nachos...Chicken Burrito and Shrimp Fajitas....salsa is fresh with great spice....prices are great too....will be back!"}
{"text":"Owner or manager of this restaurant refused me service due to having a service dog in his vest fully trained .  Never again will I patronize this establishment. Very rude"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place but the last two times I've been here my food was definitely warmed up in the microwave. This last time I had a chimichanga that was soggy and soft."}
{"text":"I can only speculate Tony's is authentic Mexican Cuisine (Which sounds funny because Tony makes me think of Italian - you know the old joke...\"To NY\"... Anyhoot.) As I've not been that far south yet. Tony's is a Taqueria for Gringos I guess? All the stuff on the menu is photographed and translated into English. The food is flavorful and relies on the food as opposed to being overpowered by excess oil & spices. 
 I like that every table has a variety of 3 different hot sauces and the waitstaff is extremely nice and pretty fast. Overall I am not exactly sure you wanna come from all over to hit up this Mexican joint but if you're in the area it's most definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Continuing my quest to find the best taco in Vegas... I saw this place as I was driving down Ft. Apache and pulled in to check it out. It's a pretty big place in a dead strip mall. I walked in, the cashier said hi and handed me a menu. My order:

2 carne asada tacos -- the meat was tough, dry, and lacked flavor
2 al pastor tacos -- very tasty and spicy. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so others would probably consider it to be mild.

The tacos are slightly more expensive than other places around town at $1.25 a pop. Each comes with onions and cilantro on top. The tortillas were ok, but nothing special. The tacos were decent, but still not better than Los Parados.

Their menu is big, with some breakfast items, tortas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, seafood entrees, a kids menu, and a whole lot more. It's worth another visit just to try some of the other items. They have 3 other locations around Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot for some Mexican food here in Vegas. Friendly staff, everything steak is fantastic, fast service. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 8 years. I originally went to their Craig location an I fell in love with Thor food. I was glad to hear they had opened a location down the street from my house. For breakfast, I always order the Chilaquiles. For lunch, I always order the Chile Verde.

I would have given them a 5 star review, however, they started charging extra for refills."}
{"text":"I don't remember how we stumbled upon Tony's and I'm even more confused at the lower-than-expected rating but we love this place! It's so cozy and casual with a great menu, delicious food, and cheap prices. The servers are so friendly and it's a really laid-back, seat-yourself atmosphere. It's clean and no-frills as far as decor goes. 
We like to go to Tony's for breakfast (along with spicy jalapeno margaritas )! The divorce eggs and chilaquiles are my go-tos. My BF likes their tacos and other breakfast items. Give them a shot next time you're craving some simple Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love there street tacos! There super cheep and delicious. The quesadilla with white cheese and beans is amazing, fills all my cravings. You get free chips and salsa but the extra dollar or two for the bean dip is worth it."}
{"text":"Mall food courts. Not known, at least in these parts, to be the haven of exemplary eats....Most malls have your basics covered, chinese, mexican, pizza, burgers and so on. 
Tony's, however, is really a step above the average. The food is really really good. Ok, so they don't make their own tortillas on site, big deal. The food is fresh and prepared to order and best of all, the dudes making the food are super nice and will customize just about anything. 
I kind of order off the menu a lot and they were more than careful that they got my order right, double checking with me as they went, \"Sir, you don't want onions, right? Why you are correct  my man!\"
They have a selection of lunch combo plate specials and even with that, their prices are pretty inexpensive. 
Sorry Hot Dog on a Stick, sorry McCrappy's...Tony's gets my money every time"}
{"text":"Waitress suggested the asada which was not that bad. My date is a vegetarian so she asked what was in the vegetarian burrito. Sadly the waitress could only think of Pico de Gallo being the only veggies in their burrito. Good quality food and cheap prices. Sometimes you get what you pay for.  Sadly, I wasn't going to pay $1.99 for a refill of the normally complimentary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was delicious. The rice was really good.Went just before closing but was not hurried."}
{"text":"Went in this early evening for some Menudo. It was great and the service was top notch. I'm looking forward to return for the 7 Seafood Soup."}
{"text":"THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD EVER. I havent had anything from the place that was remotely good. I gave it two chances and horrible.  Anyone who says anything good about this place doesn't know Mexican food"}
{"text":"Went here because the L&L next door was packed and I'm glad I did! Super fast service, free chips and salsa and the Birria Chimichanga was Awesome! The Horchata was quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"Tony's was reccomended to me by a coworker so I had some expectations going in.  Unfortunately, the food didn't wow me.  The service was very sweet and friendly.  

It's a cute place.  You sit and get served vs. the counter ordering at some other quick Mex places.  

They offer lunch specials, which is always nice.  They also serve a nice variety of tasty Mexican beers.

We tried sopes and tacos.  Everything was A-OK.  Nothing stood out as great."}
{"text":"Meh.
The tacos were ok, but a little pricey.
The enchiladas have a weird-tasting sauce and my husband didn't even eat half of them.
I felt kinda queasy after and my husband got super sick.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"this place is good. bottom line. if youre hungry for good mexican food and dont have time to deal with going to one of the fancier restaurants, this place will fit the bill. it is a sit down restaurant but you can surely order to go. you roberto's fans know you only go there because theyre only at 4 in the morning when youre drunk. that crap doesnt compare to tony's mexican food.

ive been going to tony's mexican food for the past 6 years starting off at the lake mead and jones location and now go to the one on russell and ft apache. either side of town youre on, you will get your food exactly the same. its amazing that you can count on top quality food consistently from them. 

i started off with just carne asada burritos and they hooked me. im talking carne asada, beans, rice, and sauce all wrapped up in a good size burrito that wont leave you hungry. their birria burrito is amazing and their chicken burrito is so good too. i also get their chicken enchiladas and theyre satisfying as well. 

go in there and get something. get anything. you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chile Verde is kabaam! Salsa was delicious.... food came out fast and hot! Restaurant and restrooms were clean!  Beans and rice were delicious!"}
{"text":"Giving them 5 stars....great mom n pop Mexican place! Price is so cheap, service was great. Made Jalapeno Margarita from scratch. Nothing fancy and quick. My new place instead of greasy Robertos lol"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. The coctel de camaron is a good choice. Been coming here for two years."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast, friendly service with great prices. I recommend the chicken fajitas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!!!!!!! Wouldn't waste even $2 on their chips and salsa. Rude staff!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean and smelled delicious when I walked in. Ordered the pork dinner. I was a little concerned when she brought it to me 3/4 minutes later but it was delicious!
I was disappointed at the amount of fat on my plate and piled it on the side of my plate to show my server. She said she would let the kitchen know.
I was surprised when she came back with a portion of pork larger than the fat I'd set aside. They seem to value their customers! 
This will not be the last time I eat here and I will recommend this place to anyone who is wanting delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"After I paid for my order, I regretted it. This entire restaurant lacks good customer service and good food. The food was horrible. 

I decided to try this place out because it's on my way home from work and the recent reviews looked good. Upon walking into the store no one was as the counter. It being my first time here, I started looking over the menu. A women peps her out from behind the curtain and just asks me if I'm ready to order. ( At this moment, I was about to walk out of the door but I wanted to give this place a chance). She didn't even take my order, she called for an elderly man and he took. I looked over the menu again quickly and ordered the smothered chimichanga to go. 

I should have went with my gut after the first bad encounter. What a waste of my time and money at this dump. I'm sticking with Juan's Flaming Fajitas or Pinches because this place shouldn't even be open.

If I could give this place no stars, I would. I don't see how they have 3 restaurants with this garbage their serving. 

With a name like Tony I expected more and this place did not deliver"}
{"text":"Food quality and portions are just okay. The tacos are very plain and it's over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Sit down restaurant. 

Good food.

I like that they offer adobada tacos but don't like that they're a tad greasy. 

Their horchata could stand to be watered down a little bit!"}
{"text":"First time here with my husband busy  Saturday morning the service here was great even though being busy was greeted took care of us right away ! Food and price was delicious  you guys keep up with the amazing experience  you gained 2 new customers"}
{"text":"Solid food. Good prices. I had the Chicken and cheese enchiladas. Extremely tasty. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place sooooo much, there salsa is my absolute favorite. I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food and Tony's does a great job compared to most places around town. I recommend the chili verde and chicken chimichanga."}
{"text":"Giving it 4 stars for now, it was my first time here today. The place was full of customers dining in even though they blocked off one side of the restaurant. The cashier/hostess/server was nice, speaks very good english and friendly and can definitely multitask! I ordered to go since it was busy but they had dine in only lunch specials for very good prices (mon-fri  11am-2pm) I ordered the asada torta it was very delicious and flavorful (layered w beans, meat, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and mayo) and a drink all for $8.95(anything under $10 they charge .50¢ fee) I'll def be coming back to try new stuff there, maybe even tomorrow! Haha"}
{"text":"The gringo leaving Tony's with his take-out order threw his two cents' in as we stood outside debating whether to go into this restaurant.  He said he was a Mexican food expert and this was the best.  I beg to disagree.  All four of us do.

We found out about this new location for Tony's (we hadn't been to any of them before) from a Restaurant.com listing.  We had no idea of what to expect, but I certainly didn't expect it to look like a coffee shop.  On the weekends I like to go to a place with some atmosphere, and this looked like a corner luncheonette.  But based on the long drive we took to get there, and the other customer's recommendation, we decided to have dinner there.

Though I, like a previous reviewer, lived in Mexico, I like wine with dinner.  They don't have it.  The drink menu is beer, or a margarita from a prepared mix.  I had the margarita, which was okay, but garnished with a wedge of lemon, not lime.  This is authentic Mexican (yes, I know there are no limes in Mexico - the Mexican lemon is lime-colored, and that's what they use, but the Mexican lemon is not as sour as ours).

The waitress brought a half-filled basket of chips, and the chips turned out to be the best thing on the menu.  They're crisp, not greasy or salty, and they're small, so you don't have to waste un-dipped chip.  But, and this is a big one.  Only the first basket is free.  And you get that one basket (half a basket, in our case), whether you're one person or four, whether you order appetizers or not.  Then it's $1.50 to get it refilled.  The house red salsa was very good, if you can eat burning sauce.  Two of us loved it.  I requested green sauce, and it was a cup of water with green food coloring.  No taste, no body, just water.

One friend ordered two appetizers - bean dip and guacamole.  The bean dip was refried beans WITH LARD (I asked), covered with some shredded cheese.  The guacamole was commercial and just passable; but for 1.50, I didn't expect more.

I ordered the Bisteck [sic] Ranchera, after asking if it's the same meat used for the Carne Asada.  The waitress said it was, and highly recommended it.  It came out as small pieces of meat sauteed with bell peppers, jalapeno slices, and onions.  Normally I like that sort of thing.  But the meat was greasy, overly salty, and not tender, nor did it have that wonderful special flavor that a good carne asada has.  The meat had obviously been precooked, then cut up and sauteed with the peppers in a lot of grease.  I ordered corn, not flour tortillas, but I got the flour ones.

My husband ordered the Sopes - two thick corn (I think) discs covered with the refried slop, some shredded chicken and lettuce, and chopped tomato.  He said it was okay.  

One friend ordered the Fried Mojarra (the menu says it's tilapia, but I think it's a different fish in Mexico).  She didn't expect a whole fish, since it wasn't described that way.  But that's how it came out, head and all, and she sent it back to have the head cut off.  It was left in the deep fryer way too long and was much too overcooked and dry, close to being burned.  And she had to slog through the whole fish with her hands, since the skeleton had hundreds of bones that were too small to be able to cut with a knife, otherwise she'd be picking them out of her throat. 

Her husband made his own combination plate, with a taco, flauta, and tamale, which he said was dry, but okay when he added more sauce.

All our dishes were served with refried beans, but we all requested Frijoles de Olla, whole beans without the lard.  They were overcooked and tasteless.  The dishes also came with the typical orange-colored rice, and that, too, was soft and mushy, and the kitchen didn't even bother to heat it up.

Then the check was delivered.  Instead of a normal restaurant check, it was a register tape with absolutely no indication of what each of the long list of prices was for.  We added up the number of items we had, and we were charged for one extra item.  We could have insisted that we be given a full accounting of what all those numbers were for, but we had already spent what seemed like an eternity.  Besides, we had that discount certificate, and Yogurtland was calling us - we needed something cold and delicious to take away the bad taste.

As our friend summed it up:  \"This is one step up from Taco Bell.\""}
{"text":"On Sundays I usually have my choice on where to eat but when my husband adds on this little phrase\" just as long as there is something edible for me\"....I feel guilty. He 's pretty picky so I chose Mexican food his favorite ! I wanted to try Tony's because one of my friends said it is her favorite Mexican Restaurant. What she orders here is probably fabulous but I wasn't happy with my meal. I ordered my usual Carne Asada Fries and a Beef taco . I liked the fact that they used bigger fries here but it tasted pretty generic. I'm used to my fries being loaded with sour cream, guacamole, cheese and big chunks of meat. My plate had little dollops of guacamole and sour cream on the side, The meat was tiny and overcooked. I also tried the beef taco and the meat looked juicy but it lacked flavor and the taco shells looked store bought. The service was great though ! Our glasses never stayed empty which is a big deal when we are dining out."}
{"text":"Let me start with the Margarita, it was excellent. Very well blended, it was like a smoothie, and I tasted the tequila in it through the end. But the rest was just ok. I do want to go back as I saw some stuff on the menu I'd like to try but for now 3 stars. I had the pork Chile Verde, taste was there but WAY too salty, and I don't make that comment often, I'm not sensitive to salt. Carne asada tacos were just ok. And my gf's fish tacos were good, but could have used more if that cream sauce. I also noticed the cabbage they put in the taco wasn't that fresh,  gave it an off taste to it.

**update to 4 stars, their margaritas are just so good. Also tried a Chile relleno and pastor tacos, both were great."}
{"text":"I found this place on Google as I was looking for a Mexican restaurant close by since I was new to the area. I've been there at least five times. The last two times I've was a little unsatisfied w the food.
The good :
Salsa and chips 
The staff 
Chicken tostadas
Chicken enchiladas
The sopes 

The bad: 
The soups 
I've had the chicken and the beef soup . Both times I didn't like it. 

The rest of the food has been great. I'll be going back but no more soups for me ."}
{"text":"This place was so not what I thought. Just nasty everything was over seasoned. The service was not there. I'm just so sad for going to this place!"}
{"text":"The food is authentic Mexican. The service is not good. The waiters aren't friendly. Prices are pretty high. I have eaten at this restaurant for many years. There isn't free refills on your drinks or the chips and salsa. After a bad visit a month ago I have recently not dined here. Today I decide to give them one last shot because their soft tacos are my favorite for lunch. And as usual, I was disappointed the management has removed the lunch menus."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place. It's a family business and it's very good. It's clean and their food are fresh. Unlike crappy Robertos!!!"}
{"text":"no its not another roberto's. because they actually speak english and you get a beautiful waitress that always takes care of you. the food is not greasy and disgusting like roberto's. its family owned business so their is passion involved. the prices are beyond affordable. this location is my favorite because the area is still growing and it's only one of the few amazing places to eat at."}
{"text":"Best Carne asada burrito I've had in a looong time.  Ordered to go. Was ready in minutes, got good salsa with it. Decent prices. Will be back to try again."}
{"text":"We've tried their posole, tamales, tacos, shrimp tostadas, taquitos, guacamole , rice, beans, and fideo soup ... it all tasted pretty authentic. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp tostadas because it was too bland but their tacos and posole are good. (Adobada or asada tacos are my personal favorite.) The service is okay and their prices are very reasonable. It's nothing fancy; just your average hole-in-the-wall kind of place with good and inexpensive food."}
{"text":"Love ordering from here for dinner. The street tacos are delicious, i prefer the chicken tacos but the al pastor and carne asada tacos are yummy as well. My family and I order about 26 tacos, either chicken, al pastor, or carne asada and we put them in the middle of the table and randomly choose which we eat. It doesn't matter which we choose because they're all good. Also, I order myself their chicken soup. all it comes with is part of a chicken, carrots, broth and if you want a side a rice. Super tasty, love the soup on a cold night."}
{"text":"Small little place tucked in the corner of Ft. Apache n Russell.  (Next to The Lodge)  I've been coming here since they opened up.  Straight up the best mexican food around this area.  No frills...nothing fancy just good good mexican food and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Me and my sister were tired of eating Roberto's and wanted to try something different. My sister came across this restaurant. She was telling me how great it was so I decided to check out the place for myself. When I walked in the place was a little small, but clean. I ordered my food to go. The taste of the food to me was great, but a little pricey in my opinion for the portion that they gave you. I thought the portions are too small for the price you pay. All in all I think the food is good, but not for the price they have."}
{"text":"The best thing here is the salsa and chips.

I had high hopes for this place, I honestly don't know if it was just me or wtf. I ordered a wet burrito with chicken, no onion, no vegetables, and no salsa. I always point out the vegetables because, I don't like guacamole, I don't like tomatoes, and I don't like cilantro (although it's a herb, pretty much no green on my damn burrito)

Service was speedy and staff was friendly yes, but the combinations of enchilada sauce, chicken, frijoles, rice, cheese, and cilantro was not so great. 

The horchata was good too. 

Overall I would make sure you are detailed about what not to put in your food."}
{"text":"The star rating  should be blank. I've had the worst service  at this location. I ordered a bean tostada and my friend a bean sope. It had a smear of beans. My friend  walked over to the counter.  Little  woman came from the back and told me if I wanted extra to tell the waitress. 

I told her that there was a smear and I loved the beans. She kept talking down  to me. Them told me all I do is take and take. I've  never received  anything free. She then told me not to come back. I said for a little  more beans. 

I was just at the Jones and lake mead location  yesterday. She then spoke insults in Spanish  and told me don't ever come back. This is hands down the most poorly  ran Tony's  I've ever been too. I will never go back. If you want service and to be treated like an American this it not the company. I will never go back. I have been patronizing  this company since 2012 faithfully. Never again."}
{"text":"Order the spicy red enchiladas!! They were delicious. Tastes like home cooking. The server had excellent service she went into details about questions we had about the menu. Checked back frequently. Very happy with my experience"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm surprised this place is only a three star. I live close by and frequent this place a lot. Very good customer service every time I go there. Usually get my order taken from a shorter older lady or a younger skinny guy. Their tacos are the small kind and so delicious every time. When I do eat in, I always order the churros with ice cream dessert. Also, I am a spicy LOVER, and they have a really spicy habanero sauce. If it's spicy for ME, then it will destroy YOU lol. Five stars from me!"}
{"text":"The food was good but when you order sopes it should always come with crema mexicana.  Service was friendly food was out quick, I like that especially when I'm on my lunch.  I'll come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. The carne asada wet burrito well let's just say the meat is more like ground beef. The flavor is OK, but for $8 and change I expected actual pieces of carne asada not ground meat. Roberto's is better."}
{"text":"I like being able to come here for lunch during work and it's not a chain restaurant that's super loud, overpriced or slammed. Service has always been fast and the food is good. 
Breakfast burritos are pretty fantastic. 
I just always feel relaxed here and can get things done on my lunch break. My favorite lunch place. Staff are super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want authentic Mexican food the same as you would get in Mexico I go here at least once a week their asada street tacos are bomb"}
{"text":"As a first time customer I was very impressed. Great family owned restaurant with good customer service.Some of the best salsa I have ever had. Defiantly a new favorite."}
{"text":"I've been to Tony's numerous times. The people there are friendly and treat you like family. The food is authentic Mexican food and I have yet to try anything there that I didn't love. I highly recommend Tony's!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome because it was affordable. Now they have changed owners and they charge for everything! $1.50 per item that you want to add to a burrito. Will go to Roberto's instead."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Vegas!!!!!Great family owned local business!!!!!!!! Great seafood. Oysters always big. Freshly made tortilla chips daily. Service is always amazing. A grade proudly on the window. Modern look with Mexican roots loud and proud"}
{"text":"The food is great and priced right but I would recommend that the owners think about being a little more generous with the chips and salsa... don't get mad if they charge you for a refill of nachos and salsa .. along with over priced beans and chip appetizers I would of given it 5 stars ...but because of that I gave it a 4 star and also  my kids say they should also give refills on the agua frescas ... servers should be more knowledgeable and if there was a huge rush they wouldn't be able to handle it..."}
{"text":"Satisfying for the price point. You can't get much for $10 these days, but at Tony's you can stuff your face.  The street tacos and enchiladas verde are my favs."}
{"text":"It was early Sunday afternoon and we were out for an early dinner.  Tony's came up and we decided to stop in.  The place looked like they had had full house, every table was littered with dirty plates.  The staff came and cleaned one for us, and we placed our order.

The food was good, I have certainly had better, but considering it's closer to fast food than gourmet, it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I love their tacos. I usually order the Al Pastor tacos and Carne Asada tacos. Great prices and service. The fresh guacamole and chips are delicious too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. It's not the fanciest or most popular but the food is authentic and really good. I love the chile relleno burrito!"}
{"text":"So thank Walmart for selling my mom spoiled ground beef, cause we wanted Mexican, our usual go to is roberto's, thank god there weren't any around, but Tony's was by than of God himself.
Oooooo the tantalizing flavor on my nachos was AMAZING, needless to say that u guys have earned new customers the BEST carne asada nacho ever."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is better then the bigger name known restaurants. It's a cute hole in the wall restaurant. With every mexican dish u can think of.  It has became one of my favorites and they sell alcohol too."}
{"text":"There are lots of Mexican restaurants here in Vegas, this is one of the best. Their Asada tacos are the perfect blend of ingredients. Small, so I usually order 3 but absolutely delicious. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I think they close a little too early on Sunday's. We were there two Sunday's in a row. Last night the waitress was super friendly, accommodating and everything she said was with a smile. Mind you, we got there at 825 and she was still very accommodating. The week prior we ended up going at the same time. The waitress told us we had to sit by the register because she had already cleaned the other tables, which isn't that big of a deal but throughout our dinner, she seemed more concerned and distracted about leaving at 9pm then anything else. She was definitely not too happy about being there and it showed. Room for improvement? Yes.. But the food is fresh and it's one of my fav taco places."}
{"text":"Super bummed first of all it was like 100 degrees inside. So very hot it was miserable waiting for the lack luster food.  This place looked super cool and authentic but sadly the food was horrible.  To start the margarita was overly sweet and little to no alcohol in it. Our nachos had a slimy green liquid they called guacamole and no flavor.  They also charged me for lettuce and tomato for tacos. Don't most tacos come with basic condiments? Well to top it off we were overcharged and left to marinate in the heat.  Yuck!! I will never come back."}
{"text":"Food is still good.. however the service is SOOOO bad. The women that work here are rude, sassy, and there is a MAJOR language barrier that has lead to me being over charged on multiple occasions as well as having food made incorrectly. Sadly, my order is just NEVER what I ask for. There's also a HORRIBLE stench in the restaurant, so if you do decide to try this place, take it to go. You almost can't even smell the food."}
{"text":"Love the food , the service !!! We are super frequent customers and have never had a bad experience. Always fresh, fast and polite. The young man that manages always takes great care of us. With all the competition in the area we choose Tony's location every time.

I do wish like the other reviews they didn't charge for chip refills. No one else does."}
{"text":"I came to this place some time ago and yet the horrible experience still haunts me. Matter of fact it's a running joke between my son and I. When I can't decide where we should eat he always chimes in \"let's go to Tony's Mexican Food it's your favorite!\". 

I walked in with a certificate from restaurant.com and was seated promptly. We were the first customers of the day. The kiddo had nachos. I wish I had a pic to show how sad this plate was. Chips were stale, the ground beef were so dry, hard and dark brown that I knew it had to be old meat left out or uncovered. The cheese was some generic shreds that wasn't melted at all. Those were the only 3 ingredients for these nachos. The plate looked so dry and sad even a 5 year old was disgusted by it.  

I got the shrimp cocktail and chili relleno plate. Shrimp were so incredibly rubbery and the cocktail was way too acidic for my taste. It literally gave me heartburn upon tasting it. The chili relleno was so greasy it had about a tablespoon of oil under it. The batter was also falling off of the chili. I was so dissapointed in the food that I decided that all this crappy stuff was served to us because I had a voucher. The service just made me feel uncomfortable. Why give offers if you're going to hate when people redeem them? 

To top it all off, they overcharged us on a to-go item.  My son seemed to like their rice and beans so we ordered it to go. The rice and beans plate he had in the restaurant was about $2. The to go price... $6!  I never stepped foot in this place again after that bad experience and I have long lasting memories of why I won't come back in the future."}
{"text":"The service here was Awesome but the food was sub par. It honestly tasted like something one of my cousins who was a teenager would make when her mom told her to make dinner . The guacamole was horrible and we told them but still got charged for it. The salsa was watered down and the taste did not feel authentic at all. Through my entire meal i read and re-read the yelp revies wondering if i was at a different location or something because this does not taste better the robertos and I was searching and searching for these \"great prices\"??"}
{"text":"I stopped by here one day because I was craving some traditional tacos. I just moved to this side of town, and I notice it's lacking flavor, (the area not Tony's.) 

I ordered 4 carne asada soft tacos, 1 carne asada sope.

The tacos were EXACTLY what I was looking for. The meat was so tasty and juicy with some crunchy bits in it. They were topped with cilantro and onion. They came with some limes and hot sauce. The tacos were waaaay better than Roberto's, which seems to be the only Mexican restaurant in this general area aside from Baja Fresh.

The sope was good too, it had a whole tomato slice on top which was kind of weird but still good. 

I also got an horchata. I have been craving some homemade horchata so it was only natural I try it out. It was just okay, I think it may have tasted better a few hours prior to my arrival because it was a little watery but you can still taste the milk base and sweetness. 

All in all it was 10 dollars for my feast, and it was well worth the price. I got take out so I didn't get to try the chips and salsa, or the service. From what I saw, this place is pretty empty most of the time, the cashier was really friendly and the food comes out fast. Me likey."}
{"text":"Trying to find a pair of pants and skipped dinner. After seeing my other options and reading Dwayne's review I choose Tony's.

I was not disappointed. Great customer service, great tasting and very flavorful dishes. I was not expecting good Mexican dishes at a food court. 

I even went back and tipped them. Im not cheap by any means but outside of the coins in my change I never tip at food courts thinking its more fast food than sit down but these guys earned my extra tip."}
{"text":"My favorite go to spot for legit Mexican Food! I've never had anything bad here. The best Chilli Relleno and Michelada in town."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place that serves a good coctel de campechana (shrimp,octopus,and oysters). The tatse was exactly what I was looking for. It comes in a huge glass that resembles a very heavy margarita glass. They serve it with saltine crackers, a bottle of ketchup(I didn't use the ketchup) and some lemon wedges. Its nice and cold and certainly hit the spot. The service was very friendly and my soda was always full. I will definitely recommend and visit Tony's again."}
{"text":"Our favorite mexican restaurant. And the lady who owns it and works at it is the sweetest lady ever"}
{"text":"The Nachos are the best I've ever had. I could eat it as a meal! The chicken is flavored and not greasy. The guacamole tastes fresh and the cheese is so delicious, not smothering everything."}
