{"text":"Nice area, but washroom were not clean and the music was bad and a bit too loud. We got the rigatoni, and it was really bad, and we found a hair in it!!! We also got The mixed grill, and it tasted really wierd. It had really weird spices, and didn't taste good. It exactly tasted like it was marinated with deodorant.  We also got a chicken sandwich, which was actually pretty good. We also had a burger from the kids menu, which was really good and it came with ice cream and juice. Customer service was good, they offered us a new meal instead of the one with a gross hair in it, but honestly I'd just lost my appetite. The workers were friendly. But the food took long to come. I don't recommend mixed grill or rigatoni at all, but the burgers and sandwiches aren't bad. 2 stars."}
{"text":"In a restaurant with a dozen empty tables, the staff tried to seat our party of five at a small table for four, right next to the washrooms.  The food was horrible.  Between us we ordered fish and chips, pizza, pasta and Caesar's salad.  Only the salad was good.  The red wine tasted off."}
{"text":"Friendly helpful staff, respond positively to special needs: I asked for grilled veggies only with my onion soup.  The desert are nice, I took a desert sampler. Coffee is grrreat! If you are nice with Guillermo, he will give you a smile and service gets just better!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the portions are big. Of course you pay a premium for an airport hotel restaurant. My small pasta was more than enough and very tasty. Lunch prices range from $8 - $18; breakfasts $5 - $15. Extensive dinner menu. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options on a menu with a variety of French, Italian and Middle Eastern-inspired dishes."}
{"text":"This place is both a restaurant and a lounge. The lounge is just a guy at a piano dressed in shorts, he looked like he just came out of the pool and started to play. 

I am giving the food at the restaurant 3 starts, however, the speed of the kitchen gets ZERO!! The servers get 1 start. 

The food: the selection is not vast but it is nicely put together. There is something on the menu for everyone. Beef, chicken, gluten free which is rare to see on a mine so good for them. 

The servers: I was here two separate times for dinner and every time it seemed that they were understaffed. While the servers are friendly they wait so long to come and greet you or to take your order. The restaurant was never full but the service was always slow, slow, slow. 

The Kitchen: they take the cake and the icing. We waited 25 minutes for a Cesar salad! The lava cake desert which looked like it was frozen them microwaved took almost half an hour! All the main courses that we ordered were so slow it seemed to me that they were doing this on purpose!

In summary the food is ok, but definitely not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times now as I have visited the hotel three times now. I have always got a tasty meal here. The chef just puts that little extra into every meal he prepares and it comes out great. My favorites here are the butter chicken and the Cornish game hen. For an appetizer, I would recommend going with the French onion soup."}
{"text":"I was here for a canceled flight graciously put up by air canada. I ordered the 8oz ny strip and red wine. I got the ny strip medium rare with extra veggies and no potato wedges. Everything was absolutely amazing and worth the price. The waiter offered great suggestions and made sure to keep my water filled without being overly bothersome. Based on the other reviews I almost went elsewhere for dinner, but glad I dined here. Thank you."}
{"text":"The 14oz bone in ribeye was really good seasoned but they didn't get the medium rare correct it was more medium. The sauce was really good and the vegetables were well grilled. The bruschetta was not flavored very well."}
