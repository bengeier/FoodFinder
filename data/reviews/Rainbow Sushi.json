{"text":"REALLY bad and I wanted to like it, as it is directly on our street would have been epically convienent  wasn't expecting much either just a solid Korean sushi bar with the usual menu. Well this is no sushi on bloor or sushi one at yonge and sheppard. It is first and foremost absolutely filthy which there is no excuse for. It smells terrible like cat pee and there is just dirt and mess everywhere. I know I have probably eaten at some places with kitchens like that, but this place lets it spill into the restaurant and sushi bar, its horrible I felt so uncomfortable . The food was really bad too, such a small menu compared to most sushi bars yet it seemed like nothing we ordered was ever ordered they were running around out of things and everything tasted like it was borderline off and or defrosted. feel bad they really try but I think this place is too small with too little turnover and trying to do too many takeout orders to be good."}
{"text":"I have ordered both takeout and had the sit-down all you can eat, I'll address both seperately.

Take-out was great, I ordered a few pieces of sashimi and a rainbow roll. The presentation was nice and the sashimi cuts were nice and thick - VERY important. They didn't forget a single item, I had plenty of soy sauce, ginger and wasabi included. Was pretty quick too, about 7 minutes from ordering to receiving my take out.

Tonight I went for AYCE. The menu gets a bit bigger at night, and at 17.95 (15.95 plus 2$ extra for weekend) it's priced below most AYCE restaurants I've been to for this time of day and the day of the week. I ordered miso soup, shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, rainbow roll, BC roll, salmon sushi and red bean ice cream. I was eating by myself. They were pretty diligent with refilling the ice water and tea. My gripe is that they'd bring out one sushi order at a time, so I had to eat all of one before I'd get another. I personally like to pick off each one. I suppose I could've asked them to bring out more than one at a time, but oh well.

The environment is laid back. Lots of small groups of friends and families with young kids. This would be a good place to bring the family for dinner. The music isn't loud and is inoffensive.

Certainly not the BEST sushi place I've been to, but given that it is very close to where I live, it'll do in a pinch. Plus, you get free AYCE on your birthday, how cool is that?"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for takeout.  Ordered 3 specialty rolls : black dragon(unagi), white dragon (snapper), and spider roll. 

The rolls were mediocre at best in my opinion.  The roll portion was average, the fillings were underwhelming, and the rice were a bit too mushy for my taste.  I tried it using Tasteaway so at least there were some discount on it so I didn't feel too bad.

The restaurant was decently busy though, so perhaps people were there because apparently their prices are cheap."}
{"text":"Expensive and medicore quality. I ordered online, and the computer receiving the order wasn't even on! Waited 3 hours for my food and got it only after calling in. The delivery driver then asked me for a tip. I was gonna give it anyway, but no need to tell me straight up? Not ordering here again."}
{"text":"OK but nothing amazing.
Main annoyances is the way they nickel and dime you as you can see when you read their menu.

They arbitrarily add 10% to your bill if you get dinner all you can eat (this is a recent addition). May apply to lunch as well, I don't know. But as a fellow annoyed customer pointed out, this 10% will also apply to things like drinks that your ordered, which is *definitely* unfair.
The base price for the dinner all you can eat is OK but after adding 10% it's right at par with other restaurants. The food quality is fairly good but nothing mind blowing. 

My biggest annoyance: They do not have sashimi or unagi on their dinner menu. You have to pay an extra amount to get some BS VIP menu or something if you want sashimi. 

They don't have seaweed salad, which was sad. Another weak point is the seaweed they put in their handroll is super tough, making the thing hard to eat.

I want to come try their lunch special and see if it's worth the price but I definitely was less than satisfied paying $45 for this meal based on how they tack on the extra 10% cost.

Better worth your money to transit downtown and go to one of the famous places.

Waiters were friendly attentive, but I need either way better food quality, or decreased prices if I'm going to return."}
{"text":"I had a great experience when they were at bath/Lawrence. I been wanting to try their new location. Although I'm not complaining about the food because it was good, the other things below make me question the kitchen and management style which makes everything unsettling and a bad experience. The 2 star rating is only for the food.

I was at bath/bloor ready to go to all you can eat sushi at Sakura . I convinced my girl to drive up to this place because I thought it was $20 and to try a different place. It's $2 more on weekends so for $2 less each and an extra drive this is what we got.


The bathroom is poorly maintained which makes me question the kitchen.
-My coke was in a can and the top part was dirty.
-it looked cheap now they taped over several order items, on all the order slips. It's like $0.10 a copy just reprint them instead of printing tiny labels+tape+labour, it's not like you are super busy, maybe that's where the service time is wasted.
-and who adds French fries to an all you can eat Japanese menu?
-The server didn't greet us when we entered and was kind of bitchy. 
-It clearly annoyed her that my girlfriend picked out the cucumbers in the rolls she got because she told her rudely to tell then she didn't want it.
-We had to wait until we finished everything we ordered before we got another order slip which made me feel forced and uncomfortable.
-the service was slow with 2 waitresses and only 5 tables of 2 including myself.
-she watched me tear my napkin to share half with my girlfriend and I felt stupid asking for more because it's clearly obvious we need it.
-only once did she refill my girlfriends green tea and the other 2x I asked. 
-she handed us a reused order slip with erased pencil marks.
-we asked for vanilla and green tea ice cream, the green tea was clearly a smaller portion compared to vanilla.
Also you could see they used the same scoop from serving the green tea to scoop the vanilla because the vanilla had green on it. Is the vanilla cheaper is that why there is more then the expensive green tea? Or was it too expensive to rinse the scoop with water? Maybe way too much to buy more scoop utensils.

By the time we were done eating we were the last customers and not because they were closing. Luckily some other server walked by to tell me I had to go pay via card at the front (why couldn't our server tell us?)sounds dumb but they don't have a wireless machine.

Everything seems like they are pinching pennies everywhere they can because they probably don't have many customers. But guess what, your penny pinching is driving customers away. For $2 more I'll drive another 20 minutes downtown and spend my money/gas. If you stopped cutting corners more people would come back. We won't be there for that



I tipped 13% only because the food was good, the sushi guy at the bar made me laugh and it's my way of saying goodbye."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out twice from here. They got my order correct on both occasions, which is a lot to say for Toronto.  I find there yam tempura maki rolls AMAZING and huge. 

We ordered:
Veggie tempura
One miso soup
Kappa maki roll
Yam tempura roll x 2
Unakyu maki
Spicy salmon
Green dragon roll
Dynamic handroll

$53.62

Came in twenty minutes !! Take that magic oven :P 

We order through just-eat.ca

Anyways, great sushi."}
{"text":"This place deserves better. The price is very cheap for AYCE, and the waiters are fine.

Try their Salmon Kama (salmon neck has the best meat) and don't get so many damn rolls which will stuff you with rice"}
{"text":"When it comes to All You Can Eat, this is one of the more value-priced options in the area. Quality of the food is always fresh and tasty -- certainly not the best sushi you'll find in the city, but for the price I would implore you to find better value for the money!

Lunch and dinner are all great value, and the rolls and sashimi are always very fresh and delicious.

I agree with other reviews about the temperature in the place -- it is very cold! But the attentive service ensures that your mug of complimentary green tea is always full and hot."}
{"text":"I go this place once in a while after work, they have all you can eat and food is not bad but today they brought me 10 pcs of salmon sashimi and 4 of them  were obviously not fresh, so i told the person working there he got mad at me and said : what do think ? You think we serve stale food to our costumer ? You think we want to food-poison our costumer ?  If it is not fresh just throw them out !!!!! I replied : i don't think anything, i just see the fact that this is not fresh and I am not throwing them out just get me 4 fresh pieces . And guess what ! He didn't show up ! And i paid at the cash and left.
Unbelievably bad service. And as I thought i got food poisoned."}
{"text":"I'm sad that they moved further up north. I was a frequent customer when they operated out of their old location in Bathurst & Lawrence. Average restaurant experience. Sushi is okay. Location was convenient for me. Delivery service is excellent! Literally ordered my food at 6:30, food came in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"by far, the worst sushi place in Oshawa. 
Customer service was horrendous.
The staff are unfriendly and glared at us for the duration of our meal. Our table were nice to the staff but once we saw their attitude towards us, we just wanted to walk out.
The food is bad, hot dishes were barely hot and the most the of the food were overcooked.

Our table opted for the all you can eat and shortly after we sat down, another group of people walked in and they also order all you can eat. That WHOLE table finished before we even got half our order. At that point it was obvious that the staff took longer for us on purpose because there were only 3 tables full that night ( close to closing time).

Worst staff ever. I don't know if they were being racist or they just had something against us but that's not how you treat customers. They were obviously suspicious of us... for what reason, i have no clue. But the table full of Asian got all their orders first and had no issues. 

Rude staff, i'm glad i didn't tip and If i could have just walked out half way, I would have.
^ I'm generally a REALLY generous tipper as I like to show my appreciation.
I will never be going back to this restaurant again. 

DONT BE FOOLED BY THEIR PRICES. (As some reviewers are saying it is cheaper that most places) THE FOOD IS BAD AND SO IS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

Honestly, dont waste your time here."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch today. We got the All you can eat menu. Some of the sushi was really good while others not so much. My favourite was the spicy salmon rolls and be least favourite is the udon noodles. Just pick and choose what to order. Staff isn't as bad as what others have indicated. For the price, it is definitely worth a try in the Bathurst and Lawrence area."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised no one's reviewed this place yet! I'm happy to be the first.

My friend and I found this place on a whim after a day at Yorkdale. We had no idea where we could find good sushi in the area, so I Google-mapped sushi and found this place. My friend said \"anything with Rainbow in the name has to be solid\". 

Turns out she was right. It's an all you can eat place, which I generally find to be either gross or too expensive but this place is neither. On weekdays other than Friday, you pay 13 or 14 bucks for pretty good sushi. It's not presented as anything luxurious, but it tastes really good. Weekends it's 15 I think, still reasonable.

The service is good, besides this one waitress who means well, but isn't very good at her job. Can't hate her, she's adorable, just not meant to wait tables is all. 

We come here regularly now, few times a month. I wouldn't recommend this place for a first date or anything. It's super casual. But if you're in the area looking for sushi, I'd say this is where it's at."}
{"text":"Ordered through just-eat. I have a tendency to order unique/unusual vegetarian sushi options. Because I always wonder what chefs come up with.

The delivery was FAST! Less than 15 minutes from submit to delivery. However, vegetables and seaweed were both slightly stale.

Of the vegetable roll combo:

The cucumber, pickled radish and inari were good.

The mushroom and avocado were meh

The sweet squash was firmer than it should be.

A side of rice which accompanied the order had a strange taste which I'm still trying to identify.

Presentation was great. Very appealing. Price point was reasonable just over $20 all included. Everything was great except for the freshness of the product."}
{"text":"The sushi taste amazing and the price is unbeatable. what more can I say.

One if the best sushi place you can find in this area."}
{"text":"I just can't believe this place. 

Got food poisoning, call for my money back and they are avoiding my calls. 

Ordered two bento boxes w/ Salmon Teriyaki 

I got take out from here on Saturday (3 days ago) and me and my girlfriend got food poisoning. Upsetting, but nothing crazy. So I called the next day to try get my $50 back. I called during dinner time and a girl answers and says there's no manager or boss in. I leave my name number and complaint with her thinking someone will get back to me by the end of the night. 
Call the next day during lunch, same thing. Personally, I work at a restaurant and find it extremely hard to believe that a manager wasn't in during a dinner rush let alone SINCE SUNDAY! 

Called back every day and finally received a phone call from a manager. Apparently the north york one doesn't have a manager for a month because he's in china? 

This man told me there's no way it was from his food because all the food I received was cooked and kept asking me if I had a bleeping doctors note? WHAT?!? He laughed when I suggested it was the salmon teriyaki, saying they get their salmon everyday. He also said he doesn't care if I call food inspection or the cops (why would I call the cops on them?), because we were the only ones to complain about the food on that particular night, his restaurant has nothing to hide. Like I said, it was $50 bucks, so he offered me a $30 gift card explaining the money would come out of his pocket and he already paid the delivery person. I refuse to eat there again and insisted I get my money back. He got upset and told me he wasn't going to give me anything and hung up. 

Like do they just not care? I can't believe this place, how could they not rectify this situation? 

Boycotting this place. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here for a business Lunch/Dinner. The quality of the lunch was barely passable and you can definitely tell there a lot of corners were cut. To name one particular fault, we ordered the tempura don meal. It came as a box with 4 tiny pieces of tempura and two pitiful sized shrimp. The whole thing would barely amount to a side order. The rice was also small. For the price-tag I would advise to go to the supermarket and pick-up a 4 boxes of McCain's Deep and Delicious Cake (which is actually delicious by the way) and then going to the humane society and picking up a new pet. This way you and your new friend can enjoy many slices of yummy goodness together.On a side note if you chose to adopt a dog, it's a better idea not to feed it chocolate. In any case, you would feel better setting your money on fire than letting this place rip you off. 

All in all, with the options we have in Toronto, it's a better choice to hit up somewhere else for your food. If you happen to find yourself stuck outside their front door with no legs and/or the ability to call a friend to help you get to another sushi place and you absolutely have to have something to eat then maybe, I MEAN \"MAYBE\", go inside and get something to eat. Just don't order the tempura. For this reason, I would gladly give them 2 stars on the premise that no one suffered from food poisoning.The delivery driver was friendly, he smiled, said \"thank you\", and didn't steal anything."}
{"text":"It's literally like I come to torture myself. 
I came by yesterday as Pantry Foods was closed and Umami Sushi wasn't opened at 11AM (sad) and I honestly had no where else, that was within walking distance, to go to.
I came by and was their first customer.
I decided to go with AYCE and try out a little of everything - maybe I'll find something that I'll like.

Spoiler: I didn't.

I don't even remember what I ordered but I remember their teriyaki being food court quality and their rolls as being a big nononononono.

I haven't been back since (April 2016)"}
{"text":"I went to this sushi location with my cousin on a Saturday at lunch. The AYCE price is pretty standard but the quality is pretty bad. The shrimp tempura was pretty stale and the rolls were quite dry.

The service was horrible. The waitress assigned to our table was rather rude to us. We weren't at all demanding and always said thanks to the staff; she kept on glaring at our table. This made the experience really unpleasant. Furthermore when I went pay, I punched in my credit pin number wrong once, and she kept telling me that the card did not work and shook her head when I switched to my debit card. How rude can a waitress be!? I regretted tipping her 10%!

Although this place is the closest sushi restaurant in our neighbourhood, we will not come back."}
{"text":"my favourite local sushi place. My family and I always come here for All You Can Eat Sushi around Lunch. Its a great deal especially when it is your birthday month.

I find the sushi to be fresh. I love the salmon sashimi and rolls. I've heard from other friends that they have had horrible experience with take-out and how it isn't so fresh. So I guess dining in would be a better option if you want fresh sushi. 

I feel like it gets too cold in here. Especially in the winter its freezing. But besides that, the service wasn't that bad and the sushi is good in my opinion."}
{"text":"The weather outside is ALL KINDS OF frightful and I cannot garner sufficient willpower to go grocery shopping in these wintry conditions. 

Yes, I'm complaining.  

Sushi-me! 

I decided to try a new sushi spot today. I ordered from Rainbow at 21:05 through JustEat with an expected delivery of 21:45pm. 

I ordered
-Shrimp skewers (appetizers)
-Hotate Butter Yaki (Scallops in Garlic Butter)- also an appetizer
-Green Dragon roll (with extra soy sauce and spicy mayo

The delivery was on time, arriving at ten minutes shy of ETA.
Prices were ok, not super reasonable but not crazy. In total I spent $28. 
The delivery guy was also kind of rude; he asked me for an extra tip (on top of pre-paid tip and delivery fee). I thought that was so ungracious and it put me off instantly.

Now for the pudding-proof, the matter of taste... 

The skewers were.... meh. Bit overcooked. A total pass for me. Esp. portion wise. 5/10. 
The Yaki was yummy. I think I could have eaten 10 of these. Think buttery, textured scallops. 9/10
The roll was totally underwhelming. I feel like zero effort was put into it. 6/10

I was happy for this find because my last sushi delivery experience goes back months and it was not a pleasant experience. This one came better recommend by just-eat ratings and yelp ratings but it is NOT THAT MUCH BETTER. La lutta continua.


I RECOMMEND: Trying the scallops. They are bite-size pieces of heaven.

EXTRA TIP: The minimum delivery order is only $15 (as opposed to $30 at many of my favourite eateries), but a $2 delivery charge applies to all deliveries"}
{"text":"The sashimi was fresh and cut in very generous portions! The maki's etc were delightful as well~ A+ price and quality for an ACYE! Only three tables were filled while my friend and I were there, so service was fine."}
