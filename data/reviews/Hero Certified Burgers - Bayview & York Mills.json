{"text":"Now we are talking. Hero Burger is a superb burger joint hands down, and the price is right. I tried the classic with cheddar cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. The burger and fries taste better here than most nearby burger joints. Everything is too expensive in Toronto; glad to see Hero Burger offering a great product that is similarly priced in the US. Now can the HST (sales tax) be reduced? The location is also nice, in a strip mall with ample free parking. I also recommend walking in the surrounding neighborhood to burn some calories after eating here. This area has some of the nicest homes in GTA."}
{"text":"Hero Burger's are decent but not great. On paper, they seem like they would be great with 100% Angus Beef, hormone/antibiotic free, etc. but I find their burger doesn't really have a lot of taste. For the price, there are better options (Allen's!)  I don't like this location all that much, the set up is horrible logistically. If there are more than 3 people in line, you'll have to wait outside, or form an awkward line. Seating when it's not summer is very limited as well.  Overall, it's better than the typical fast food chain burger, albeit at a higher price. But if I have more time, I'll drive further and get a better burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great fries (Sweet potato is even better), and great atmosphere. Burger cooks are pretty much professional chefs that would be in the running for winners of Cutthroat Kitchen or Chopped. And they have personality, which makes your wait for the burger even better as they can make you laugh like crazy.   100+ drink machine is great, any drink you want. Solid, thick, & tight!"}
{"text":"Can't say I will be going back to this burger joint.   - #1 complaint is the fact that burgers have WAY too much binding agent. The texture does not feel like ground beef. It has a Harvey's processed feel. I know they advertise angus beef, hormone free, etc.. maybe.. but it sure doesn't taste/feel like it.  Perhaps they are frozen?  No idea.  But you can obviously tell that their burger patties are NOT the type that you can mold prior to cooking.  - Too many toppings that cost extra.. even mushrooms  - Average fries.. I prefer ones with skin on  - The bun was quite good.. yellowy in colour, but nice texture with sesame and poppy seeds on top  Overall, Hero burger gets its ass handed to them by other boutique burger chains, like Five Guys, South Street and Big Smoke."}
{"text":"This burger place is located in the most unnecessary plaza in Toronto. It serves to absolutely no businesses immediately in the area, because there are no businesses immediately within the area. But the million dollar houses surrounding it keeps this piece of superfluous land in industry, and so we have a Metro, some upscale deli, Marche, a pharmacy, a cafe, and..a HCB?  I ordered a signature burger, 8oz. They screwed up my order and charged me less. They gave me the 8oz without charging me the difference, which is what should happen in a restaurant, so I guess I got a deal.   There is nowhere to sit, front of house is barely big enough for a queue to be formed, which in Toronto Condo terms, half a million dollar worth of space!  The food is mediocre, the service comes with a smile, but that's as much service you'll get from a fast food place. I don't think we should refer to the service at fast food places as 'service'.  \"The transaction went off without any gun shot and blood.\" Just as you expect in a burger place.  What is this burger place doing here in such a neighborhood? Do upper-middle class people suffer from beef between bread cravings? What kid wants to go to a burger place marketed towards adults?   What on Earth is it with the Hero in their name? How Heroic can the profession of burger making be?"}
{"text":"Meh, when they opened first, they had some of the best topping, like spring mix rather then lettuce, now it's just another burger joint, the burgers are alot like Harvey's but at a slitty higher price. If u are looking for a quick (ish) eat this is it, and it's much much much better then the subway across the street, don't even get me started with them."}
{"text":"Hero Burger was all the rage when it first opened up in close proximity to my place of employment at Yonge and King.  Despite hearing lacklustre reviews from some of my colleagues I decided to take the plunge.  I had trouble giving Hero Burger a mere three stars, because I do love the concept.  They do try and provide a quality product, in that they are made with 100% Heritage Angus Beef are hormone, antibiotic and gluten free in addition to being Halal Certified, BUT you do pay too much for what you actually get.  The burgers are thick and some of the condiments are definitely an added bonus yes Maple Chipotle BBQ Sauce I'm talking to you.  I also like the variation in cheeses that can be added, at an extra charge I might add, but they are still available and appreciated.  Especially the Blue and Goat cheese.   Quite possibly Hero Burger simply failed to live up to its hype and I'm punishing them for it with a mediocre review, yet to provide it a higher rating would be a grave injustice to the Detroit Eateries of this world."}
{"text":"Came here today for a quick lunch. I go to the York Mills Shopping Centre frequently because it's close to home, but for some reason I had never come in here before.  As soon as we entered, we were greeted by the highschooler employee. He explained what Hero Burger was all about. The list of menu items is pretty comprehensive and a lot of the toppings are free. Guacamole and peppers will be an extra fifty cents or so, but that was about it.  The pricing is a little expensive for what they're offering, but this franchise is new so I won't stop believin'.  Drinks are bottomless here, which is a definite perk."}
{"text":"OK burger that costs way too much.    Its kind of like a fancy Harveys and it won't give you intestinal discomfort later in the day so that's a plus but with all the choices for burgers this place just doesn't stand out.  Burgers have two choices, go cheap or go for quality and this place does neither."}
{"text":"This is a hamburger not rocket science.  They are not different than Wendys or burger King or Harveys.  There is really nothing special that they do with their burgers.  They are just twice as expensive and not really worth the cost."}
{"text":"Start on a positive: cool coke machine.  But Raspberry Coke isn't as interesting as you would think.  As for the food. First thought. I paid $15 for this? Second thought. Ya... I'm not going to eat this.  Poutine: better described as potato cheese beef gravy soup. Fries were run of the mill, cheese curds were old, gravy was blah. Ate the cheese, and the rest was pretty inedible.  The cheese burger: standard factory processed party, topped with 1/2 slice of cheese and what is best described as yesterday's leftover lettus and tomato.  AVOID!"}
{"text":"Poor Hero Burger is getting a lot of flack from people. I've never had anything but good experiences here. I think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places, mainly because the diversity of toppings.   I like the fries here, but they're nothing special. Same with the poutine, same with the onion rings (I;ve tried em all). But those burgers are good! No word of a lie!  I think the prices are pretty standard for these types of burger places and service has always been fine for me.  They have a great coke machine...which I know sounds super weird, but you choose your drink...and then can choose the flavour. For example...if I want Fanta, I select that and can then choose any number of Fanta flavours. I always go with a diet cherry coke...where else does that even exist in Canada???! (I'll tell you actually. You can get that at Licks, but they get really confused when you ask for diet coke, instead of regular...they make it themselves).   Criticisms of the small location are valid. This place is very small and cramped. Not nice to eat in...or even to wait. But it is what it is. They have a mounted flat screen for people to watch and they've done what can can in a super small space."}
{"text":"You don't feel welcome here. The girl at the counter let's you know. ATTIDUDE! Slow service. Pricey food. Half the rinks are unavailable. Burgers were ok"}
{"text":"No Milk! Must be the only restaurant in the world that does not carry Milk! I would have ordered a combo but I don't drink pop and the expensive little egg burger, which was my breakfast, didn't go down well without a drink!"}
