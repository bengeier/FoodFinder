{"text":"This place started off good but the portions have gotten smaller and smaller. That would explain why I have never seen more than 2 people in the place. For what they charge I would recommend jaburritos on rainbow... kinda sad because it could be amazing but the portions control is so strict a large bowl does not fill my 8 year old...  one slice of avocado on my bowl tonight... seriously???? I will not be back....  Also... if you do not care about customer comments and you just want to say how great you are,  then keep buying your 5 star yelps with free meals... to have you argue back how great your portions etc are is just proof of how oblivious you are... your response to me is ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Got the ahi tuna with shoyu sesame sauce, seaweed salad & ginger.....way too sweet for my pallet & defeated the \"healthiness\" of the bowl..hurt my stomach a little. Regret not taking that drive to poke express instead. Well at least now I know."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I tried several poke places within Vegas while visiting and I felt this was one of the better ones. Staff was very friendly and helped me through the process.  The food was fresh. Definitely try this place if you haven't been."}
{"text":"We have been going here the past 6 months about once a month. The food has been good. Customer service very bad. After going there several times this last time they messed up on the order, however I did not catch them messing up. So we called when  I got home and we realized. They totally blew us off and called me a liar. Yikes! That is brutal to have given your business for several months and to get treated like this. There are other places to go like this. We will not be back again for any reason. This was completely unacceptable. Oh yeah, if you keep your \"stamp card\" and have 9 out of 10 stamped they will not allow you to get the free burrito until your \"next visit\" even if you are buying 4 burritos. It is just so very evident that they are greedy and do not value even their loyal customers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is so good! Staff is friendlyJohn was very nice! Best restaurant I have been to in awhile"}
{"text":"I was near the Cheyenne area and heard they had a Sweet Poke in Centennial Center. I am a frequent customer at their Rainbow location because I live near there. It didn't seem too different than the rainbow location, still bomb as ever!!! For those who are new to Sweet Poke, I hella recommend the Dragon but instead of the chipotle mayo sauce, get their creamy jalapeño sauce."}
{"text":"First off it's so awesome sweet poke opened up a location on the south side here on rainbow. The service is great and the food is amazing. I've had both poke bowls the '808 bowl' is very traditional, so good & there sushi burritos are so yummy!!! Shrimp lover & dragon is my favorite. Hands down, the best"}
{"text":"I was walking by this place and I remember a friend telling me some good things about it so I decided to try it. The girl behind the counter gave me the recommendation for the 808 bowl after I said I've never been here before. She also explained the menu very clearly to me and was super patient as I ordered.  My large bowl came to $12 (after my UNLV student discount) but it's definitely worth it...the food is fresh and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. If someone doesn't like it maybe they didn't choose wisely. Only 4 stars because $1 for cream cheese seems pricey but the product is great. So many choices."}
{"text":"Visited this new joint down the road from UNLV.. It's an easy 5-7 minute walk from the Tonopah dorms... I had to try this place out and although it doesn't compete with the poke bowls from Hawaii where I'm from, it still was delicious.. The staff was very friendly and helped me. I had the Large Poke bowl with Shoyu Ahi Poke. Definitely will come back here again and will try their sushi burritos!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for the weekend and was craving something healthier after the numerous amounts of buffets and decided on here. The store seemed pretty simple. It was pretty much a chipotle but serves poke bowls! The staff are genuine and sincere to their customers. As I came into the store, I was immediately greeted and ask how my night was going. On top of that, their prices are pretty fair compared to most poke places! I was pretty satisfied with my meal. Numerous amounts of selection for your liking. What I got was an hefty portion of tuna with my selections of sides. Great place overall. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! The employees were super helpful and friendly, made my whole experience simple and enjoyable. The food was amazing, every thing looked so fresh. Defiantly will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Knowing that there are a lot of Poke Place to go even what our friend Tiffany and Marc recommend to go which is the Sweet Poke but I chose this one because it was the closest Poke Place to me. So I had reviewed Yelp which is always sooo helpful to us because I can read the reviews and look at the photos. Being at the end of the night almost. I can across this young Filipina which is sooo helpful to me. All I had to say to her that was my first time and she patiently and thoroughly explained to me all my choices step by step. And I mean all there food was still looking fresh and neat. From the choices of Salad. Fresh seafood and shrimp and endless choices of sauces and toppings. By the time she finish. It looked Awesome. . Besides the Food. Everyone likes to have a good service right. This place ROCKS besides the great service. I appreciate her and the food. OH. Sooo great when I ate it. I can sleep well"}
{"text":"Portions for the price not worth it. Soho sushi burrito better portions for your price. Employees have no clue what they doing. The salad they made me looked like it was worth more like 5$ not 10$. Very disappointed in this place, I'll continue to drive across town where the food is worth the cost."}
{"text":"D' 9th Island in the heart of South West Las Vegas...with the local touch, awesome custom poke ever with the twisted of mexican style sushi burrito and Japanese cuisine. D' Ono grind \"808\", built with \"ahi tuna, ogolimu, Hawaiian sea salt, chili flake, green onion and sweet onion with sesame shoyu sauce\" absolutely lower in salt, filled with \"salmon, cream cheese, avocado and furikake with eel sauce.\"  E'h brah\" broke the mouth!!\""}
{"text":"My favorite poke place. Delicious, healthy and affordable. They are very generous with the food. I am never disappointed with their service."}
{"text":"I'd give a 3.5 star rating if I could but 4 is too much. This place was just ok to me. The sauce the guy recommended was amazing (a mix of 2 sauces named after the chef) but what killed it for me was the rice. For one they don't offer sushi rice which is a lil disappointing, and on top of that the white rice wasn't cooked well at all. Some pieces were very hard and there were several chunks stuck in balls as if it was old.  the quality of fish was just ok too but considering it's a poke spot and only $12 for a large bowl u get what u pay for. However if the eel came with 4 pieces instead of 3 I probably woulda given it 4 stars"}
{"text":"First time trying and this place was FANTASTIC! Fresh everything! You can taste how fresh it was! If you love Poke id highly recommend trying this place out! I like to eat healthy so this place is now on top of my list of healthy places to eat at!!!!  Staff was also really friendly and helped me choose what to get because they had soooooooo many great options to choose from!! They actually have fresh fish!! You van tell the difference in the taste!!  Again HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! Cant wait to come back and try something new!! Great Job Sweet Poke!!! Keep up the GREAT WORK!!!"}
{"text":"never seen this place before i guess its 'hot and new' so i tried it out and iv gotta say im impressed. its clean and pretty inside and tons of staff to help. food is awesome and super fresh which is crucial for fish. really pleasant experience here i will be back."}
{"text":"Great new spot. I'm coming back for sure. There is so much to choose from and u can customize anything you want. I made my own tuna bowl and omg it was amazing. I'm telling all my friends to try it"}
{"text":"Nice staff, super helpful and patient with my 3 teenagers trying to make up their minds. Clean, fresh and generous with the portions, no skimping here. Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This location just like the other one has fresh products, and the customer service was also great. They helped me try something new, ive tried the shrimp lover and i had the dragon, cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great new establishment, the shrimp lover was good, everything was fresh and customer service was great. Definitley will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend got me on to this place, its amazing. Sushi burritos sounded extremely bizarre but so glad that we tried this place. We are definitely going for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Place was really good ! Great crab meat and ahi. The large bowl was a bit small though for $12 dollars lol I do love my big sizes. The place itself is small too so watch out when it gets really busy if you want to eat there."}
{"text":"I had the Diego burrito, the fish tasted fresh and it was even a little spicy (if you like that sort of thing. The price was reasonable too (around $12 for a combo meal)."}
{"text":"This place is really good and my new go to spot.  I love sushi so having the ability to customize a bowl is a really great concept. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to stumble upon this restaurant today. They just opened up today. I got the samba burrito & he built his own bowl with salmon & crab. Both were delicious. The ingredients were fresh & tasty. The owner & staff were super helpful & friendly. When we were ordering a customer came back for seconds & they had only been open for 3 hours. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back! Service is awesome, fish is fresh and there's tons of options! Ally is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. Tried a bowl and a burrito. Both were really good but I think I prefer the burrito style. But I don't think you can go wrong with either."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service from the curly-haired man with the glasses. He recommended me a few things that turned out great. My poke bowl was to die for. Will return."}
{"text":"First time trying poke bowl. Got 3 scoops of spicy tuna and yellow tails which were really fresh and tasty. I loved how I can make my own poke bowl w/ different toppings. I will definitely coming back soon. Love Sweet Poke!!"}
{"text":"First time going this weekend and I was really excited to try it. When I went in there, it was a mess. Only three people behind the counter working, couldn't hear what they were saying at all. They looked really stressed out. This guys made the bowl and he cracked it, then had to restart again. No napkins, even kindly asked for some and still stood there waiting for awhile. I took the sushi bowl home and couldn't even eat half of it. Just had a bad taste and didn't feel fresh at all. Maybe it was a bad first time experience but I won't be coming back for awhile."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great burritos and even greater service. All the people that work here are so nice. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat!!!! What a great way to curve my sushi cravings without over eating and paying those high prices at sushi bars. Been there several times but today was the best cisit. CHASE who works there was professional and personable and it was a pleasure speaking with him. He made the best sushi bowl I have ever had there. Keep up the good work Chase!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great new place to get a fix for fresh delicious poke in the southwest vegas.. Been here 4 time, 3 of them before they officially opened giving away food to get me hooked and train new employees..clean, friendly, healthy, variety of toppings..met the owner who listen to his customers..luckily I've been there when it wasn't so busy..they said busy times have been during rush hour evening when people getting off work.. dunno why some people rate low for something ridiculous like a customer cutting in line..saying it doesn't bother you then rant on yelp..really.. or a new employee learning the ropes.. the menu is extensive with different combination..i do the point yeah that one..can either order a bowl or sushi type burrito Rating the food and my experience has been nothing but great.. it's what to expect from a fast food type experience..so far been consistent on their end..in and out in 10 minutes or less"}
{"text":"Been open one day and they've got it down. Amazing. I had a burrito, made it a meal (drink and seaweed salad). It was excellent. Coming back for dinner"}
{"text":"Just got back from Maui and was still craving poke...my wife googled \"poke\" and \"Sweet Poke\" came up. Since they were down the street from the house we decided to give them a try. I was pleasantly surprised when we entered. Place is clean and inviting. Everything was fresh and delicious. We both got the Aloha Bowl and were extremely pleased. We are both coming back and definitely making this a regular on our food rotation."}
{"text":"The poke here is so delicious!! It's been a long time since I found poke place this good, especially a good sushi burrito. Another plus was they had great customer service. The workers were friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Is this Heaven? Even if you don't prefer fish, this place will make you reconsider. I had the Citrus Salmon. Bomb! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Such a nice place. Fresh fish. So many options. Great customer service. Clean and tidy. The build your own bowel was just simply amazing. I'm so glad I live across the street."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! This is one of my favorite restaurants! They have a wide selection of fish and sides. Also the staff always have an awesome attitude. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place! Yummy, fresh fish. Have been there twice so far. Our whole family loves it. Great way to get your fix on. The $9 bowl is perfect!  The only reason i am giving a 4 star and not a 5 is because there is a lot of plastic being used, they should have a recycle bin too!!"}
{"text":"First time here. We live near by and we keep seeing it as we drive by so we decided to stop in. I got the spider burrito and added shrimp tempura to it. The shrimp gave it that extra kick and crunch to it which I loved. And their mayo sauce and eel sauce mixed together really well to give it an overall good taste. I'm not too picky about my fish or seafood but I can definitely taste the difference between frozen and fresh and here tastes fresh. You watch them make it and it's pretty quick. I got the combo with the miso soup which was also yummy. Overall, very good place. Cute ambience, very welcoming staff. I'd recommend this to anyone.  We'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food, friendly staff, and great prices! I'm so glad this unique, healthy restaurant is perfectly situated in Centennial!"}
{"text":"This was my first adventure into poke bowls, and it was really good! The ingredients were really fresh, and the people are super nice. The owner was really hands on in making sure the food and service were good. I found the options of building your own a little overwhelming but I liked my combination. The only down side is that one was not enough to fill me up, but that doesn't have anything to do with the business, so I still gave it 5 stars."}
{"text":"10/10. Great location, friendly staff, and most importantly, amazing quality food and prices!"}
{"text":"Loved my first visit.  I went there again tonight and my rice was undercooked and hard in the middle.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Ingredients are of high quality and the staff is very friendly. Will definitely come back whenever I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"The food looks great and would be a perfect regular eatery if it didn't have rude immature teens running it. I dont care about really happy, smiling workers but i do care when someone is serving me fish, coming back from baking it laughing at the fish with coworkers. I ordered one day and this young lady couldn't hear me over the glass and was automatically sarcastic with me. I speak louder but being only 5 ft tall it was difficult. This young lady and another teenager kept laughing and staring at my family and I. Gossiping at us. She made it very clear she messed with my food in the back while it was baking  I do not trust this place for this reason. They were rude and very disrespectful! Hopefully the owner will spot this and correct it. I know I am just one person who will not go for this reason, so it wont make a difference but im sure i will not be the only one offended by these immature children."}
{"text":"Love this place so much that we asked them to cater our wedding and they did!  Jean was so helpful and accommodating and made sure everything was perfect on our wedding day. He kept us stress free and made sure everything was set up beautifully.   Our guests loved the food as much as we do. We will definitely return and keep sharing this place with friends!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm already hooked! Everything is fresh and the sushi burritos are amazing. Also, the seaweed salad is a must get. Got to check this place out if you're in the NW side of town."}
{"text":"Overall was an \"O.K.\" place. I was excited to hear this place opening up in Vegas as we don't have very many options for getting Poké, but was slightly disappointed in the taste of their Poké. It did have a little bit of flavor but that mostly came from the fish itself. The sauces and ingredients used were a bit bland for my taste and I typically don't have to add soy sauce or any additional sauces but this time I feel that it was needed. Also, the price for a regular bowl is $9 ($8.99). I thought that was a bit expensive since I've had better Poké bowls for around $7. On the bright side it was completely customizable and was filling, even with the regular size."}
{"text":"I've never written a Yelp review before, but Sweet Poke was so good I felt like I had to share my love for this poke spot. Sweet Poke hands down serves the best poke in Vegas. It hits all the targets -- clean space, friendly service, and fresh ingredients. I've gone to some of the other poke spots when I visited, but I always found myself wanting to come back to Sweet Poke because it gave me the best bang for my buck.   The salmon poke bowl is my favorite, but everything I tried was really good. If you're looking for a convenient but still yummy meal, Sweet Poke is where you should go."}
{"text":"Great new poke bowl and sushi burrito place near work. Love it and can't wait to come back. Fish was fresh and flavors amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and helpful staff! Cant wait to go again"}
{"text":"Lack of customer service, they have a bunch of young kids who don't care about helping people through their order. Just go to Poke Express. The music was so loud I couldn't hear the employee. The young girl didn't know what sprouts were and got a HUGE attitude and chuckled, never going again and I'm making sure everyone knows of the horrible experience I had."}
{"text":"Love this new spot... Delicious food, great staff & overall awesome experience! I would highly recommend to anyone looking for fresh, healthy, & inexpensive food!! The staff really tops off the experience with their friendly & positive attitude. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I could write 2 reviews for this place. The first 5 stars. We used to come here once a week for the yummy food and reasonable prices.   Today it gets a 1 star for customer service, specifically towards the manager. Not sure if we want to come back here due to the very poor customer service we received. Manager was unprofessional, stingy, didn't honor a brand new coupon that was exactly the product listed and not expired and wouldn't leave office to come talk to us face to face when concerns arose."}
{"text":"Just visited while on vacation and was craving some poke. I found this place was very close to my friend's house whom I was visiting and it had just opened up. Very nice and trendy atmosphere and cleanliness. The staff was also very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I will definitely be coming to this place again once I come back to visit.   I got the the dragon, high recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been coming here steadily since they opened. In that time, it's been nothing but a great experience with awesome food. The staff are always a pleasure to order from and more than willing to get your food right for you. Even when the line is crazy, they cruise through it pretty quick.  They have a great rewards program via the perka app. Earn yourself that free food!  Overall, this has become a big staple place for me."}
{"text":"I like it. Definitely better than Jabburitos being that they don't try to make it part Mexican.  Still the atmosphere is not that welcoming. Very cold, plain, loud if there are a lot of people, but food is the most important thing and it is good.  I am glad they offer a variety and brown rice, soy paper option."}
{"text":"Very good. We live just down the street so it's great to have a place like this so close. So far I've only tried the make-your-own-bowl but it was excellent. You simply choose what type of rice, sushi, sauce and veggies you want. I would have liked to have a bit more sushi though. You choose either 2 or 3 scoops of each fish. Each scoop is a bit too small but I still enjoyed my lunch. I would definitely recommend going here. It's refreshing to see more than just fast food or deep fried options along Rainbow."}
{"text":"This place has gotten a lot better since my last review. They have updated their interior decor and the customer service is a lot better. They also have a loyalty program where you rack up points which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Placed an order on their new app which was really easy. I showed up and none of the people working knew about online orders, so of course it wasn't ready. Waited over 30 mims for them to research my order and then prep it, because of course they were slammed.   Lost all confidence in their management. Sheer lack proper training for your staff.   Food was great and reasonably priced for sushi.  Will probably avoid if at all possible."}
{"text":"It was my first time there today and I enjoyed it. I created my own roll which was on a soy wrap (pictured on the right* I don't remember what exactly the wrap was called), shrimp tempura, ahi, cucumber, avocado, and my sauce was siracha mayo. My boyfriend had a roll on a seaweed wrap, shrimp tempura, ahi, spicy ahi, cucumber, tempura flakes, siracha mayo as well and avocado. Yum! :-)  The workers were very nice and helpful (being my first time and I had no idea what to order or how to order or what exactly I wanted) and I liked the variety of things you could add to your meal - like veggies and protein and sauces etc. My 1 year old son even ate most of his roll so I guess you could say he enjoyed it too!! I'd defiantly go there again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is always great. The fish is fresh and so are the vegetables.  The customer service makes the restaurant even more enjoyable. I need to point out Jackson's customer service as being absolutely amazing!! I will continue to keep going to this poke place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I figured since my usual sushi place, I love sushi, was closed and the traffic was bad on eastern that how could one sushi burrito be that vastly different from the one at DIY poke but yikes..the employees were wonderful and didn't do anything wrong, but this was just BAD. I got the exact same thing I would at DIY and this was really just awful. I feel sick now. This is like if white people opened a poke place..even the eel sauce was awful. I guess I'm just spoiled by I Love Sushi's everything. Good employees though  I was at sweet poke?? Lol I'm not making this up wtf?"}
{"text":"I just got home from Sweet Poké and felt the need to discuss how great my experience was. The staff was amazing and knowledgable, the restaurant was clean, and the food was AMAZING. I got a regular bowl with tuna. I've been to several poké stores in the valley, and this is BY FAR the best one. Everything was stunningly fresh, the selection is well varied, and many premium toppings, like avocado, are complimentary. I want to take also mention two staff members in particular who were fantastic. Jasmine, who was so sweet, helped with the protein stage of my bowl and made an amazing sauce combination that escapes me now, but was absolutely delicious. Aaron, who helped with the toppings, was spectacularly polite and friendly and put time and effort into the presentation of my bowl - so much so I asked to take a picture after he was finished to send to my friends. Overall, Sweet Poké is an amazing addition to the Silverado Ranch area and I can't wait to go back. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, lots of choices and delicious fish and sauces. Plenty of toppings to add to make every bite different than the last. Gotthe poke bowl, will have to try a burrito next."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious and service is good. I haven't tried the bowls, but the rolls are awesome. I prefer the soy paper over the seaweed. Try the Spider roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of poke until I had sweet poke! I always creat my own bowl, this is what I love more about this place. Salmon is always fresh and delicious! I add my favorite sauce, spice mayo with some rice and avocado !! Love love this place !"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Great customer service. Fresh food. Big portions. Awesome prices!! I'm addicted. I've been eating it 3 days straight and I don't see myself getting sick of it anytime soon. Lol! Such a breath of fresh air compared to fast food. I finally made it after working literally in the next shop over to it for 2 months. The girl working the first time I went (wish I got her name to mention here) was very sweet and explained how everything works and the choices they offer. She recommended mixing my chipotle mayo and yum yum sauce.... SO GOOD! The gentleman, Christian, who works there was also very kind. He pays attention to detail and makes sure you get what you want and are happy. Thank you all!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was sooo good!! We've been waiting for it to open! So happy we have good restaurants coming to this area! We got 2 burritos and a bowl made them a combo 2 drinks side of miso soup & edamame. Under $30 for all of that! The flavors were so fresh and delicious. We got there at 9pm left about 930 they were busy the entire time. Workers were very nice and fast! I already want to go back tomorrow!! Can't wait to go back def will be on a weekly food trip!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and what great customer service. They guided me in picking my meal, as we customized my bowl. Came home and the fish is amazing very flavorful and FRESH!! The establishment is VERY clean! I would definitely recommend it!!! And I will be going back !!!"}
{"text":"Moving to Vegas from Colorado I was appalled at what passes for fresh food in this town.  For the past year I had been resigned to the fact that fresh, fast, and good didn't exist for me anymore.    That all changed when I visited SweetPoke last night!  The shrimp lover was divine but my partner's build your own was like sweet ambrosia, nectar of the gods! I liked it so much I returned for lunch today.  The staff is super friendly, the food is all fresh and exciting.  The only negative is the space is a touch noisy."}
{"text":"Sweet poke's have been popping up everywhere in Vegas! Been to a few already but this one takes it to the top. The interior is outstanding, the dim lighting and the vibe gives it a more modern feeling to it. Great experience again! Thank you, my friends also enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Heard this location was opening up on near UNLV. I work near the location so it is more convenient for me! I've tried sweet poke on rainbow and thoroughly enjoyed it. After trying this location, cant say they haven't changed much! The consistency is still there with quantity and quality. It seems like the staff has some experience, they were able to recommend me items and ran through the line with ease. Glad they prepared their workers for opening day!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The environment was clean when I walked in. I was immediately greeted by the workers, made me feel welcomed. Their portion sizes were filling with the quality being pretty good. Easily can tell that their fish was fresh! Fresh fish + Great portion size? Theres no complaints from me :P will be back forsure."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.  Our only caveat was there was too much rice compared to amount of fish. Burrito was yummy."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Very good poke selection.  Easy to order.  Reasonable prices.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"They were amazing and took care of all my needs. Twice! I came back again twice in one day because it was so good!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was amazing. I wish I remembered the guys name that helped me, but he walked me thru everything. I went home and had a delicious bowl I built myself. I chose three proteins: yellow tail, crab, and spicy tuna. All were fresh, all were tasty. There was so much food I got two meals out of it. I went back a few days later and there was another guy there who helped, not as friendly. I ordered the same exact thing, and there was a huge difference in the size of my bowl. Super disappointed. Charged me $1 extra for two slivers of cream cheese. I paid for cream cheese my first visit but the amount I got was worth it. I have a huge issue with consistency. I don't want it to be a toss up every time I dine somewhere. That's the reason for 3 stars. Otherwise based on my first visit I would've given them 5."}
{"text":"Yummmm this place is bomb! I got the small poke bowl with salmon, spicy crab, white rice, seaweed, mango, cilantro, onion, avocado, edamame, tomatoes, and this really good sauce that I forgot the name of. I am a huge fan of the way it turned out. The portion size was great, too. I will definitely be back. Thanks Sweet Poké!"}
{"text":"Our family just had lunch here and it exceeded our expectations!!  My husband and I each made our own custom poke bowls- it was super fun to pick exactly what we wanted. Most importantly, the poke was fresh and delicious. I'm so excited this place opened up here in this part of town!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME. Nothing like this back home. It's like an Island Subway where you make your own bowl instead of a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great Poke and conviently located for me.  Louie/Lewie took care of us and made the customer service experience great.  Glad to have good Poke in the area since H20 went downhill."}
{"text":"This location just opened near my work and we were all excited to have another option. I tried the Citrus Salmon bowl and thought it was delicious! I was able to customize and add a few more veggies, everything was fresh and perfectly prepared, and the staff was awesome! My coworkers ordered a variety of dishes and no one had any complaints. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"UNSANITARY PROCEDURES & BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. If this place wanted to compete with the other sushi burrito spots in town, they need to step it up asap. A big fan of the concept, I was excited to see this place open on my side of town... but was quickly let down, as the people working here need to be trained better and up their customer service game. Falling in line, all I knew is I wanted something with the traditional sushi crab mix -- so I ordered the SHRIMP LOVER burrito. The girl working started to set up my order... Let my story begin.  - STEP 1: Rice on seaweed. So far, so good! - STEP 2: Adding the shrimp & shrimp tempura... and as this was happening, I was already starting to get grossed out as she kept dropping ingredients onto the metal surface and proceeding to pick it up and put it into my burrito. This happens twice and I'm biting my tongue. - STEP 3: The crab mix. But wait... she proceeds to say, \"We are out of crab mix, do you want spicy tuna?\" Um. I don't like spicy tuna. I came here for crab mix. I ask her if they are able to make more, she blandly says no. I say out loud, \"If I knew there wasn't any crab, I would have ordered something else.\" She stares at me blankly. I say, \"You should announce this before people order something, especially if it's a main ingredient in what they are ordering.\" She continues to stare at me blankly. No apology, no remorse, no offer to amend the situation.   If I was a shitty person, I would have up and left -- right then and there. For a new establishment, this is not how you make a first impression.   I ask to get the crab stick as a substitute (you know, the imitation crab that you can buy at the store that looks like a string cheese). She adds one stick and starts to ask me what vegetables I want. I ask her if I can get more crab added and she goes, \"I already put one.\" I say, \"Yeah, I'm asking if you can put more.\" She picks up two pieces of crab, drops one onto the metal surface, and puts it back into the ingredients container it came from. DISGUSTING?! Ingredients dropped around shouldn't be put into the customer's food let alone back into the container, contaminating all the other ingredients. Mind you, this same thing happens to my boyfriend's order twice as well. Gross.   I prayed that our meal would at least be delicious... but no. We both agreed it seriously lacked flavor, it wasn't packed with ingredients so it wasn't really in the burrito shape, and it definitely was not worth the price. No comparison to the other sushi burrito spots, and it's been a while since I've been this disappointed. Do yourself a favor and just take the extra drive to SOHO SUSHI-BURRITO on Sahara. I know I will."}
{"text":"I was hungry and found this place. I ordered dragon. It was like Japanese Maki sushi!!  Taste very good!!  Rice is perfect!!!  I'm from Japan. I know many sushi restaurant don't know how to make rice.But , this place they know how to make it !!  Thank u!!! Also, sources was very good!!  I think they are using own source. I should ask them \"can I buy source\".........."}
{"text":"Disappointed that they practically had nothing for kids. They had a kids meal with a salmon burrito which my children had no desire to eat. As we were there another mom felt the same way and had to tell her kid \"there's nothing for you to eat here.  I hope they'll survive in this business complex with several family based restaurants.  Just a simple bowl of rice and chicken for the kids would be enough.  As far as the food it was okay and glad something different in the area."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food is good, otherwise it would have gotten 1. The customer service is horrible! No one greets you when you walk in and the girl that was making my bowl was so miserable and kept on hurrying me up when there wasn't anyone behind me. Didn't smile once. I get it's a new place and the employees are still getting the hang of things, but you would at least expect good customer service. No matter how good the food is, I'd rather make the trip across town where I know they make me feel welcome. Sucks even though it's right down the street from my house. Hope their customer services changes."}
{"text":"I always get the salmon Shaka and it's never disappointed. They're really nice to me and there's hardly ever a wait. The food is fresh and it's great that we can add all the different toppings."}
{"text":"Sweet Poke is my favorite sushi burrito. This location has great staff, great environment & great food!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi burrito place in Vegas. Everything always tastes fresh and they offer lots of topping options at a good price. Bonus: they don't charge extra for avocado which is a huge bonus in my book."}
{"text":"I have no reason Not to give this place a 5-Star Rating other than the fact that I'm Not a Sushi / Raw fish eater, so I have only 2 limited options - Shrimp Tempura or the Cooked Salmon (& I don't like Salmon) ...but the Flavors were Exceptional in my Tempura Bowl & when I'm ready for the Same meal I will be back for sure. Anyone that likes Sushi would definitely Love this place"}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday to pick up a Sushi burrito and a sushi bowl for my wife and I. Customer service was very good and they were very polite.The food was excellent and very fresh. There were quite in assortment of free condiments that you could request. Pricing was well worth it for the amount of food that you got it tasted very good. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com. I go here at least once a week. Both the bowls and burritos are great. Had a few times where I would order from the app and come in to pick up only to be told \"we skipped over it\". But it takes only a minute to be made and they will do it right away.  UPDATE. Still go here quite often. Customer service has severely declined. All of the staff have a serious attitude every time I go in. It's a drastically different environment from when they first opened. Pretty disappointing. Also, I don't even order from the app anymore. Order has been wrong 9 out of 10 times I used it. Seems like the staff is getting lazy."}
{"text":"This is a amazing spot for a authentic sushi burrito, I love how you can add avocado free of charge to your sushi burrito the staff is very knowledgeable about their products especially this young black girl, I forget her name but she was a sweetheart"}
{"text":"Amazing! I have tried the shrimp lover and the dragon roll burrito. The food is amazing and great quality. The staff is so friendly and helpful and offer their advice on what to get in your burrito or bowl."}
{"text":"Light, healthy, fresh delicious lunch. I ordered a soy paper \"burrito\" filled with Salmon poke, mango salsa,  Avocado. Its cut in half and wrapped in paper.  You can get your sauces on the side so it doesn't get soggy. It was just perfect.   Definitely will be coming back and trying the salad bowls.   A little bit of the light side of Hawaii in centennial."}
{"text":"If you like poke, this place is a great concept. You can choose poke bowls or sushi burritos. Great assortment of fish that was fresh and plenty of toppings to choose.  You can choose from preset flavor combinations or make your own selections. It works like an assembly line at the counter kinda like Subway.   Staff was friendly and helpful. Lines can get long but moves quickly. Pay at the cashier after you put your food together.   Prices are a bit on the high end. Average is about $15-20 per person.  However, considering what cost is spent to deliver safe raw fish, it's worth it. Also, no real options available for kids in terms of price or special portion sizes.   Overall, I will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"I understand they are a new place so I'm cutting the guys in the back some slack... I got the 808 bowl and didn't think it was flavorful. It was ok. It didn't blow my mind and my taste buds like other places. I already knew after paying for my food I was going to be disappointed. My instincts were right. Everything was ok, but I prefer the other guys because they are more seasoned and know what they are doing and what customers like. He portions are also smaller here. For that same price you can get more for your money at the other guys. :) I'll give them another shot in a month or so to see if anything has improved. If not, back to SOHO I go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very clean.  Simple and well organized.  The food is delicious and is good for me.  Staff is super friendly and very helpful!  I love it!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. For the most part my wife and I were impressed. Good quality. There were a few problems to iron out. Staff still learning the menu. Also we were pleased to see a cooked salmon burrito on the kids menu for our 18 month old. Unfortunately we got home and the salmon was raw so. Hopefully they will get it dialed in and be there for a while. We will go back."}
{"text":"First time here..Good spot for those Hawaiian cravings! Miso soup and a Pokè Bowl with Ahi tuna,Yellowtail,Spicy Tuna and a couple pieces soft shell crab(wasn't a fan of this not freshly cooked and anything fried and battered in my opinion doesn't seat out well once cold) Fish was good tho! And topping are awesome tons of fresh veggies. I got my bowl with spring mix salad and brown rice Miso soup was very good too!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband loves sushi. This place hit the spot. Finally, a poke place close by. We love it and reasonable price we definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  There are a lot of sushi horror I places popping up in town and I've been to quit a few and Sweet Poke is by far my fav. My go to is the shrimp lover but since they introduced the beef bowl, I've been getting that!! Bomb dot com lol  Great service, great food! A must try for any sushi lover!!"}
{"text":"Good food, a lil tough to order if you don't really know how to order. Good food though"}
{"text":"Not to bash this place but I ordered the cooked salmon kids meal and they could not put avocado bc they said they ran out - WHAT? out of avocado at a sushi/poke place?! - Then I tried to order an adult portion burrito and they didn't have asparagus (the burrito calls for tempura asparagus)..... the ingredients are definitely FRESH, but I couldn't get over how many items they ran out of. I want to love it - maybe if they actually have the selection they say they have then I'll have a better experience next time!!"}
{"text":"So good. I could have just kept eating the sushi burritos. So tasty and healthy, I cannot get enough of this kind of food."}
{"text":"We came in later in the day and ordered 2 build your bowls. We had mixed brown rice and veggies with tuna and shrimp. It was fresh tasting and delicious. Definitely a good first impression. Will be coming back here again. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after driving by 100's of times. I was pleasantly surprised with the food. There are many suave options to choose from and a lot of toppings. I simply with there were a few more kids bowl options."}
{"text":"So good!! I'm so glad to have a place like this in the northwest part of town!  Place has always been busy when I go but the staff is very friendly, efficient and helpful with helping you decide what you want to order! I always get a burrito and it's pretty big..I usually eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner.   I wish they delivered! Lol"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The team here is super friendly and the food is great. Also now they have added ramen noodles to the menu.  It all taste great."}
{"text":"Quality is on point with this place! I love all you can eat sushi but I can't be doing this on a daily basis! Sweet poke makes my day when I eat here! It's affordable and When I have a sushi craving this place hits the spot without over filling my tummy"}
{"text":"Great healthy alternative to fast food. I love to come here for late lunch or before heading home. Great crew and great clean place."}
{"text":"My husband loves poke! So happy we found this place. Quick and lots of options. Tasty too :) customer service was great as well. We will be back in the future"}
{"text":"This place is super clean! That's a biggie for any seafood place for me. The girl was super patient and helpful while I decided and even gave suggestions. Burritos are 9.99 and a good size with generous scoops. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good.. i got myself a poke salad, you can choose what kind of fish and sides you like to add on."}
{"text":"Burritos are smaller than other places and they don't close the ends so it's sort of like a large sushi roll that you pick up instead. I'm not big on that. I do like all their sauce choices and how you get two proteins before an up-charge. I usually get a poke bowl, half tofu-half romaine lettuce, with ahi, and add a ton of stuff (think crunchy! Tortilla strips, cucumbers, radishes-gotta compliment the texture of the fish with some solid crunch). There is nothing bland about the flavors unless you aren't requesting flavors. They have sauces. Sauce yo shit up! They'll let you taste the sauces first so there's no excuse .  I've always been impressed how friendly the staff is.  The line can get long and getting an order together can take a bit longer than anticipated, but here I am, back at it again with the red sauce."}
{"text":"Giving it an A-OK - because I will be back - I feel over confused when I eat here, but looks like it has potential ... if they last that long.  I have been twice.   On the first visit - food was good, but missing a sauce that I had to ask for.  Otherwise, I ordered off the menu, but was still asked what I wanted in the bowl.  I said twice, \"exactly like the recipe on the wall\".   Second visit, same thing - plus while she was making my food, there was someone standing on the food service shelf behind her fixing a light.  Then the other girl wiped it off ... Ummmm - a ladder? Or, maybe not while customers are around.  That was just weird and seemed very unsafe.  I had a much better/cleaner experience down the street."}
{"text":"As a frequent customer at SoHo burrito I was excited when I saw this place go in on Centennial. Decided to run over there one afternoon and grab some food.  I ordered a couple different things to take home and have my family try. Everybody thought the food was great. While the pricing isn't incredibly cheap, I did think it was fair for the food you get. If you consider how much you can pay for one roll at a sushi restaurant and not even end up full this is more than fair. The food was really fresh, the employees were super nice, and the place was very clean.  I thought the menu selection was pretty varied. I'll be going back again and taking other people with me."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING. I've had this place twice, it was pretty good the first time, but the second time I ended up with 12 hours of food poisoning from hell. I had the tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. It was the only thing I ate that could have given it to me and hit me almost exactly 24 hours after eating it, which is typically what happens with food poisoning. So, you've been warned. I feel bad leaving such a review, but it's the restaurant's responsibility when they are serving raw food."}
{"text":"Riding down Eastern and saw the words \"Sushi Burrito\" on the side of the building and intrigued me enough to check it out on Yelp and decide to stop on by. Boy did I find a gold mine! Not only are the people who work there extremely welcoming, friendly, patient, and knowledgeable, but the menu options are unique and tasty! If only this place existed in Illinois, I would be one happy camper! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I usually come here once or twice a month and do a bowl from the list I never make my own. The reason being the New York bowl comes with mango salsa and avocado if i make my own you have to pay extra for the avocado n salsa. I went there last night and asked for a New York bowl the guy told me they were out of avocado I said ok that sucks and have him put the cucumber on and I say as a Substitute for no avocado can i get cream cheese he puts on the cream cheese n goes it will be a dollar more. I'm like then take it off that's why I asked can I substitute you not having the avocado in the end I wasn't charged the dollar extra but then the rest of the order the guy acted like I was wrong and stealing from them.  it put a bad taste in my mouth. I live close to this place but i will travel some where with better customer service before i come back."}
{"text":"I got a Bowl, with Tuna and YellowTail mixed with Maguro, Sesame Shoyu, Eel Sauce and Yum Yum Sauce. You'd think that three sauces might be a bit of an over kill, but it wasn't. The flavors together was DELICIOUS! Im not too picky with fish but I felt like the fish was fresh and not frozen. The Miso soup was yummy as well.   The workers are super helpful and patient and know how to take care of their customers. I also like how clean and well taken care of this place looks.   I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"GROSS!   I chose my own toppings for my bowl because i could be a little picky.  The tuna did not look fresh as it stuck to the paper napkin in the container nor did it taste fresh.  The shrimp is not cooked fresh and split in half and then ripped into pieces.  The crab is fried and the eel was fatty, previously cooked with tons of sauce on it...no bueno for a fresh or healthy option.  The sauces are either mayo based or soy sauce based.  So either saturated fats or a mouth of salt.  I asked for very little wasabi aoli and she put so much on it was like  a fish salad without tasting the fish.  Maybe that is how they get around the \"lack of freshness\".   The toppings looked days old or canned.  It was just no good and i will never be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Well first and foremost, the food is AMAZING! Every time I eat here I feel good after. I feel full. This is the only poke place that hasn't let me down. Also, great staffing too. Louie is very friendly and always makes you feel welcomed. 14/10!"}
{"text":"This is my kink of fast food: delicious, healthy, served by great employees. Three scoops of Ahi Tuna is the bomb. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with this place. But... it's one of those places I wouldn't necessarily miss if it disappeared either.   The food is ok. I've been here two times already, and I always feel that 1) the fish doesn't seem fresh (which worries me, because I don't want to get sick) and 2) the service isn't that great. The service has been ok, but I always walk away feeling that no one there really likes working there.   Again, I've had worse. I would eat there again, but it's not my choice for poke bowls. I'd prefer To See up the road, but I know others would say otherwise. Preference I guess."}
{"text":"Great guys and really great Sushi Burritos!  We also had the special pork roll, which we thought tasted a bit Korean. Very nice!"}
{"text":"I like sushi. But I love good quality sushi better.  This place hit the spot. Came here with my mom, sister, and my boyfriend (he's not a big fan of sushi) but they loved this place! You can customize any burrito/bowl they have on the menu as well order it completely custom. In the time that we were here (about an hour) about 15 people came in.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful. I will be back very often!  #NewFavoriteSushiSpot"}
{"text":"Two Words: Suhweeeet Poké   I've been craving poké for the last few days. There weren't any decent ones around me. Well, just one but there was a long line and I went to Pier 215 instead.  Showed some properties to my clients and saw this as I passed by.   Lots of ingredients to choose from and they are quite fresh. The workers there are pleasant and efficient.  I even downloaded their app where if you purchase 10, bowls or burritos, you get a bowl or burrito for free. Will stop by again!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews so this one counts, guys.  This place is amazing - great food, GREAT staff.  I come here every other week when I get that poke craving, and they are sure to please.  Good protein, yummy sauces, and a huge selection of topping that I go crazy with. (And that's why the staff have this huge grin when I come in, they know I mean business)  Huge fan!"}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for sushi burritos and pokes...plus their new menu is sooooo good.."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place! My favorite is the Vegas burrito, something about having mango and cream cheese and avocado together just makes me happy.  The bowls and burritos are huge, I can't conceive of getting a large bowl but I always see guys going for it. I have no idea if they finish it, but more power to them if they do.  You can get custom combinations but they also have an excellent selection of ones to choose from. I love their taro chips also, but I rarely get them as I can't eat more than half of a burrito or bowl anyway."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for a while now and have been dying to try it. I'm so glad I did too, it's basically sushi I'm a bowl or you can get in a burrito wrap. You can choose any rice and any type of fish like salmon or spicy tuna and other type of fish. You can add toppings like ginger, eel eggs, pineapple, mango, spinach, tempura, etc. price is great for the serving too! I would totally recommend this place it was delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"Love the food here, friendly and courteous staff. Sometimes some minor issues with orders, but for the most part highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first and was greeted by the lovely Josh and Roshawn behind the bar. It wasn't very busy so the two helped me decide what I was going to eat. After asking too many questions and sampling more than I should have, I finally decided on a bowl customized to my liking. SOLID BOWL!! Seriously, I left the counter with the best looking bowl I could have possibly imagined. I devoured that bad boy in a matter of minutes and sat back in my small wooden seat reflecting on the wonderful meal I just experienced. All in all, it was a great meal for a great price made by some great people. Thank you Poke masters."}
{"text":"Great Food and great service! We tried some of the raw seafood, salad and veggies. I would surely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Sweet Poke. I absolutely love this place! There's a lot of other sushi burrito places in the area but there's a few reasons why this one is my favorite.   This place is always super clean. They have a large counter and everything is always super organized and orderly. At some places, their topping get all mixed up. For example, there will be pieces of tuna in the salmon or there will be green onion in the masago. I never see that happen at sweet poke.   The customer service here is impeccable. Everyone here is super nice and helpful.   They are also super generous with their portions. And at some places, crab is considered one of your proteins, but here it is included. So you can get salmon (or whatever your fish of choice is) and a scoop of crab for no extra charge.   They also have tons of options! They recently added watermelon and strawberries to their toppings. Some people may think it's gross, but I always add watermelon to my burritos now and it is soooo good.   And finally, their ingredients are super fresh. The salmon I get is super fresh and all of the vegetables and fruit are also really crisp and fresh. I definitely recommend sweet poke"}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple times already and I love it! I always get either the shrimp lover sushi burrito or the 808 sushi bowl. I don't change up or add anything to how it's prepared! Both are delicious! My daughter loves the cali roll sushi burrito here too!   If you haven't been here, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not a fan of raw fish but after my boyfriend forced me to come here I decided to take a nibble and ended up eating his entire bowl. Hehe ;). Seriously delicious the sauces are the best. I think it was the shoyu I tried. I'll definitely try it again it's very healthy feeling"}
{"text":"Definitely a bang for your buck type of place. Portions are huge and the quality of the fish/toppings are outstanding. It's one of my favorite poke places because of the variety of toppings / sauces to choose from. Barely any up charges unlike some places who charge for spicy tuna or avocado, here it's FREE!! I would recommend this poke spot because it's super delicious with friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"They get kicked down a notch now. This is because of their online ordering experience. I recently tried to place an order for pickup. I should add that they will not take an order over the phone only online through a site called chow now. The problem is not all of the toppings and proteins are listed as options online that they have in the store. When picking sauces, it will only allow you to select one. If you would like two proteins it will only allow you to select one. There is a comment section if you would like a special request but it limits the characters used by telling you \"too long\" after you've already filled the whole thing out. If you call the store they will not take the order even if you are having trouble getting what you would like through the app. This could be easily fixed by allowing more characters in the comment section or by adding the things that aren't listed and allowing the user to choose more than one option in the sauce and protein categories."}
{"text":"Been to multiple sushi spots in Vegas and this is bar far the best. Make your own bowl or roll with fresh sushi and old familiar rolls like the spider or dragon roll. We went early around 11 and they staff was friendly and attentive. Clean and modern style setting. They didn't have any garlic ponzu but I can overlook that for how great everything else was. Highly recommend. We also got a free soda for their opening month."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good and definitely beats its competitors around the area. Prices are lower than soho sushi in the student union at unlv. They also have this entire section of add ons for no additional cost! They had avocado, corn, tempura flakes, ginger, mango, and so much more. So load it up!"}
{"text":"Just had sweet poke for the first time. We got the shrimp lover burrito with seaweed and substituted yum yum sauce and spicy crab, and the 808 bowl with spicy crab. They were delicious! I don't understand why people are blasting this place if they made their own bowl (you picked what you want in there - tell them to go easy on sauce?). We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I had the sushi burrito. Good fresh seafood food and lots of yummy goodies to put on it. Friendly staff. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Very cool and interesting concept. You pick a poke bowl or a poke roll from the menu or create your own. I picked the Ahi Lover roll. It's like a giant sushi roll, more like a wrap in seaweed paper or soy paper. Yummmm. Besides the fact that the young man helping me didn't know what was supposed to go in the roll, was clearly nervous and shaking, and I had to stop him from putting in crab and put in the tuna instead (you think Ahi Lover would give him a hint), overall it was very good. I will be giving this another shot to try something else."}
{"text":"This is the best poke place I have been to in Las Vegas. All of their locations are consistent with the excellent service and quality of fish. It's so delicious and I always crave it. A regular bowl is enough to fill you up. I've never had the large bowl but from what I understand you get one main protein for your regular bowl and you have many options for your base (rice, brown rice, salad, etc) they also have many sauces and most are spicy but they have 3 sauces that aren't spicy at ( I hate spicy food). You can then choose other topping like I.e. spicy crab, crab, spicy tuna, salsa and many other vegetables and avocado. Then you have other toppings to choose from after your second choice of toppings it's just amazing for the price and the service is so amazing. Everyone is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Wow wow woo the best poke bowls I've ever had in my life. I went to the centennial location and the service and staff were friendly and all smiles. They were very patient with me in picking what toppings and type of poke I wanted cause their menu and options are pretty big. I can't wait to try their UNLV location and I hope it's as good as this location."}
{"text":"My brother (a refugee from finer places and recently implanted into the \"Meadows\") brought Sweet Poke to my attention.  I have been off the grid in multiple sorts of ways.  Thank you Bryan W. for putting this awesomeness on the radar!  I made my first visit two day ago (09/27/16), when I suggested this soon to be a Vegas gem to my co-workers.  We arrived before the lunch rush....keep this in mind should you pay a visit during the 1st of the witching hours.  After 1200 for lunch there is a significant increase in the operational tempo.  One day 1, I ordered up a bowl with rice and seaweed seasoning to boot.  I added two scoops of ahi tuna and some soft shell crab.  Add Masago...you will not be sorry.  I selected everything to be mixed sans the soft crab with the house poke sauce.  I added avocado, red onions, jalapeños, and sea weed.    OUTSTANDING!  For the price, your going to get the equivalent of several sushi rolls!  My initial assessment, was that I needed another bowl or perhaps something else to take the hunger itch off.  Don't fret.....give it a moment and you will feel content.    Today, I returned with the GF and ordered up three scoops of ahi, and kept everything the same.  Again...it was another solid experience.  As I type, it's a little after 9:00 PM.  I may have snacked a little bit, but as a whole I am content.    The electronic menu states they will be opening up places in the area of UNLV and Eastern/215.  Stand by residents and travelers to said areas!  YOU ARE IN FOR A HELL OF MEAL!!"}
{"text":"Love all the choices here, and the ahi is super mild and tastes fresh!  We usually get the build your own, either bowl or roll.  I'm not totally sure what all the ingredients are, and I would love a little more explanation of what the different items are and what might be good with my bowl.  Definitely recommend for a more health-conscious choice!"}
{"text":"This is my new fave. I tried poke for the first time a few months ago & I've been to other places but this place beets them all. The staff are awsome"}
{"text":"New spot in the southwest! Another sushi burrito joint I tried the bowl with soft shell crab which came with a good amount that I couldn't finish. I also did ebi(cooked shrimp) and topped it off with spicy crab! I tried the creamy jalepeno sauce and it was great. I wish the portions of protein and toppings were a little bigger."}
{"text":"Great poke bowls!   Will definitely come back.   Sorry I don't have any pictures as I was too hungry and forgot to take one."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably priced and the sushi burrito I had tasted fresh & delicious.  Unfortunately, they were out of soft crab so I had to change my order...but my burrito was still tasty."}
{"text":"They've improved from my last visit- I came here when they first opened and didn't have much variety. We did the large bowl with mixed white and brown rice, 3 scoops of variety fish ( poke, yellowtail, eel) with spicy tuna. Very good portions for the price. Service was friendly and helpful in making sure our dish taste just right. They had lots of toppings to choose from. Definitely will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Sweet Poke is the REAL DEAL. Never have I experienced a sushi restaraunt where you can make your own burrito using different types of sushi and vegetables! Yes you heard that right, a burrito and sushi combined! The flavors in the Ahi Lovers burrito was friggin magical and I am someone that rarely eats seafood! Sweet Poke was an eye opening experience and I know I am coming back to try out the sushi bowls!   Sweet Poke, more like Dank Poke."}
{"text":"I just got back from backpacking in Europe and I was craaaaaaaving poke for the longest time since there aren't any poke joints in Spain or Italy, and I found that this location opened up near my mom's house. I got the Dragon Burrito, yes a Dragon Burrito, it tastes like what it sounds like! Crazy! Unagi, spicy tuna, crab, eel sauce, chipotle mayo, cucumbers, and to top it all off with avocados. I haven't tried the other poke burritos/bowls yet (except the Ahi lovers burrito and the Aloha Tuna which I both highly recommend as well)  but you bet I'll be coming back during my lunch breaks. Staff were very friendly and were very patient with me!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My favorite is the Salmon Shaka with organic tofu as my base, sprinkled with furikake. The house sauce mixed with the salmon is a bit spicy but I still love it. The fish is always fresh and they are generous with the toppings (masago, green onions, cucumber, avocado, crab) and then the additional optional ingredients are in great selection, even though I only get seaweed salad and ginger added to mine. I love the taro chips with the wasabi cream dip too! Sometimes the chips are in bits, though, which I wish they weren't. But they are generous with the serving. All in all, Sweet Poke is my favorite poke bowl restaurant and I've tried several of them around town."}
{"text":"I noticed this place a week ago and I immediately wanted to try it. All I have to say is that I'm in love!! The food is clean tasting and has the freshest ingredients. A quick and healthy go to place on the go. Deserves a five star."}
{"text":"Ahhhh. Went back and it was GREAT!! So happy! That anticucho soy is so good! I always do the build your own and outside of a few poor experiences here and there, it really is a solid place to eat. Great job y'all."}
{"text":"We wanted a fast, inexpensive, relatively healthy lunch and were in the area so we decided to give Sweet Poke a try (also a coupon for 50% off the second meal helped make the decision!) It is a Chipotle style order at the counter to create your own dish. Start by deciding bowl or burrito. Then which rice (white or brown) or lettuce, then the protein decision (choice of about 5 or 6). Next which sauce (again 5 or 6 options). And then choosing the add ins (about a dozen to choose from). I went with brown rice, double spicy tuna, eel sauce plus chipotle sauce, and about 5 other add ins. Everything tasted very fresh. Huge portion - very filling. The decorating in the restaurant is spartan at best. It is set up for take out or functional eating rather than dining. Using the coupon, lunch for 2 after tax and tip, well under $20. Good value. Good meal."}
{"text":"Sweet Poke is a small storefront restaurant located in a very small strip mall across from the UNLV campus (with Cafe Rio and Bowlogy), its really easy to miss. Like other poke places I've visited, you order at the counter and the servers put together your bowl inn front of you. I opted for their 808 bowl rather than put one together myself. The protein is ahi tuna. I got it with a base of brown rice (you could also get it with white rice). Lots of lettuce on the side. A few other ingredients. Plus a generous portion of ginger on request. The ingredients tasted very fresh. On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and the tables and bathroom were clean. They do offer free wi-fi. On the negative, it is really a small restaurant, which is important if you are looking to eat in rather than take out - only 4 tables plus a small counter area. Compared to other poke places I've eaten at, the portion size was small relative to the price ($10 for a really small bowl). Too many other places really close by to get a fast lunch. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My son has been raving about Sweet Poke.  So when we were  hungry today that's where we headed.  The service and the food were both great.  We are sushi lovers and their spin on sushi ingredients in refreshing.  I  had a bowl and I loved that there are multiple choices for the \"base\", ie, brown or white rice, tofu, salad, and two or three other choices.  You can choose from one of their preset bowls or rolls (which are like a burrito) or build  your own. They also have several sides to choose from.  The servers are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"New poke spot across from UNLV. It's right next to Bowlology and Cafe Rio. This place is very comparable to Soho and To See Roll. It fills my sushi and poke cravings. I had their dragon bowl but I also customized it with other toppings. The food here was really fresh and flavorful. Their unagi (eel) is my favorite. Plus they offer brown rice ! I love that they also have seating along the wall if you prefer eating by yourself , which I do a lot during my lunch breaks when I'm at school."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a sushi burrito place in my life until just now I was very disappointed though. The flavors were okay but the rice is mushy and cold not really a good combination and there sauces were strange tasting.  their bowls were fresh but I really didn't like the combination of stuff on it so it made it really squishy. And forget about getting their fountain soda it taste like rubber hose. Their edamames are cold. Not worth the 30 bucks might just want to go down the street to the sushi place."}
{"text":"Stopped here many times as I've always enjoyed my \"bowl\" or burrito (sushi roll). Sometimes I'll select the house specialties, like the 808 or Shaka, and other times, I'll wing it with a custom order. When I brought hubby in, he was a little overwhelmed with what to add to his burrito/roll, but our server was very patient, funny, and offered great suggestions. Hubby loved his creation and even went so far as to hope the server would be there again on his next visit, haha, as if anyone could remember all those different combinations. If you haven't been to a poke location yet, just know that it's not intimidating--take a few minutes to look over the menu before you step in line, observe how others order (you can pick any base like steamed rice or brown, salad greens, etc., or nori or soy paper for a roll, then add cooked or raw proteins, plus go to town with the sauce and toppings)--no one will judge.  Been pleased with my food and their service at each visit. Of course there are peak times, so expect a line, especially at weekend lunch times. It's in the busy Centennial shopping complex, next to Subway and Benson's."}
{"text":"We've been waiting to try this place and I have to say......it was just average. Decent but nothing to really wow about. And the portions are kind of small. The food is fresh and tasty but not sure it's something I'd crave."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean  Service was quick  Food fresh and tasty  Lots of topping options    Customer Service: staff could be more friendly"}
{"text":"My favorite is Sushi and today we came To Sweet Poke and not only was the service Friendly, fast,and personable, but the atmosphere was cozy cafe style... Perfect for kids!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic 1st experience. Friendly staff, fresh food, super fast service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is because they forgot my miso soups, having ordered #4 combos. Won't stop me from going back though."}
{"text":"Having been around the West Coast and eaten a lot of poke from various places, Sweet Poke stands out as one of the best places I've been to.  From the portions (I hate getting screwed over with tiny portions) to the quality (for Vegas, this is some pretty fresh stuff), I don't have anything to complain about.  Did I mention they also offer a bunch of stuff to put on your bowl that ranges from veggies to fruits?! Don't get me wrong, I wasn't sure if mango in my bowl was gonna be good but I've become a believer.   As an added bonus all the staff are spot on. Polite and attentive, they made me feel comfortable as I tried to navigate all the options I had for my bowl.   TL;dr: If you're like me and don't enjoy poke because it feels like you're getting screwed in terms of food-to-price ratio, this place destroys that paradigm and has you leaving with a happy tummy.   (They also do the whole sushi burrito thing, but I'll save that for another time.)"}
{"text":"Food was incredibly delicious and fresh.  I built my own bowl and add some deciduous mango salsa, It was about dollar extra but definitely worth it. They had plenty of other toppings for free as well. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"First time was excellent the second time I got food poisoning. It was horrible. I will never go back there ever again."}
{"text":"The best balance of taste, cost, and portion when it comes to a sushi burrito. Their sushi burritos are a flat rate (of $9.50) and you have the option of adding or subtracting \"toppings\" with no extra charge!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not one to eat sushi or almost any type of seafood but I make an exception for this place. I love their shrimp lover burrito!! It is reasonably priced and very filling. I definitely recommend this!!"}
{"text":"Good food and fun atmosphere. It's pretty small do it can't accommodate large parties"}
{"text":"I live in Aliante, and this is the place I come when I want poke. It's the closest place to home and it is good. I'm a salmon lover so that's the main thing I get,  and I'm satisfied every time. I've also had their spicy tuna and it has a good kick. When my sister and her husband came to visit we came here and they loved it as well. For a quick bite that is refreshing and not too heavy, this is my go to."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant. Cheap prices, phenomenonal service, and great quality. I go at least once a week. I've taken to describing it as the \"Subway of sushi.\" You definitely need to try it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for poke. Came from Cali and there are so many poke spots that opened up in the area. Tried sweet poke and I was hooked. They have a variety of toppings and sauces to go with your choice of proteins. The servings are pretty big compared to other poke spots. I always come here whenever I'm in town and the place is clean, which is so important to me. Anything here is good."}
{"text":"SOLID 4star establishment. Granted I've only been 2x but both times had me already thinking about the next time I come back and who next I wanna bring with me to experience the yummy delicious-ness that was devoured and all at the price of under $10.   Establishment is in a great location and easily seen from the street when driving by. Plaza isn't fully occupied but this place is definitely the star of the show in this plaza.  Rainbow is really becoming a second Chinatown, just a lot cleaner lol. Anyway, all these pokè places kinda have this similar to subway, but for sushi burritos or bowls, they have things you can order so you don't have to think about the ingredients you wanna add, or what I go with, the create your own.   What I can say that really stands out to me about Sweet Pokè is a couple of things I'm gonna list out: 1. super healthy (I mean it's raw fish) 2. lots of options (at no extra charges i.e. no extra charge for seaweed salad!) 3. ability to mix & match the options to your heart's content 4. I walk away actually full but not feeling heavy & guilty for my food addictions 5. Service has been spot on every time with friendly & helpful staff  Here's my experience and breakdown of the place:   I've always gone with the bowl (personally I feel you just get waaaaay more outta it that way) which I do the Regular Serving which is 2 scoops of your choice of protein which options include: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, freshwater eel, shrimp tempura, tofu just to name a few. But get this, you can mix your scoops; 1 scoop of one protein and 1 scoop of something different. But also before you choose your protein, they will ask you rice or salad & for rice they have brown or white (I'm brown rice for the healthier option) and even that you can get half/half. With their salad options they have spinach, romaine lettuce, &/or spring mix which again you can mix all that at no extra charge. So once you pick your base of the bowl and picked your scoops of protein out, they will ask you types of sauces, and there's no limitations. they mix your protein and your sauces in a separate bowl then add that to your base bowl. because I get half brown rice and half salad mix, I even ask for sauce of my choice in the bowl drizzled on my salad. Okay so now you have your bowl base with your 2scoops added to the mix. Then the fun part, the toppings and extra yummy goodness to make your create your own exactly that! What I really like as a unique feature is you then get your choice of 1scoop of either shredded ahi tuna, crab, or spicy crab.. no extra charge, so it's like I have 3 scoops of protein which is alright by me!! So with the toppings, I always add tempura crunch, seaweed salad (which is not extra charge here & I normally pay extra for it) edamame, & fruit (dude, don't bash it till you try it! mango & pineapple pieces actually go amazing with the combo) but they have corn, tortilla chips, pico de gallo, jalapeño, all kinds of other stuff.. so combine and mix away! And there you have it! the Sweet Pokè experience!   And real talk I walk out feeling fully satisfied. The poke is delicious, the serving size is definitely worth the bucks you pay, & honestly for the price and availability of options, I'd pick this place over some other popular sushi burrito/bowl locations. So why only 4 stars? It's missing decor and ambiance for me. It's pretty plain jane simple in there and first time I came, it as a smell of hardwood kinda similar to what you smell in home depot lol and I'm not sure if it's because of the table furnishing they went with, or the construction next door, but it just lacks in even just wall decor, set up, & presence. Definitely it's a quick eats place for sure, but I think they could warm up the ambiance of the place just a bit  so it's not so blah. But otherwise yeh, no, solid place for me. If I could it'd be 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been here about three times in one week! We both love sushi so instead of the regular sushi restaurant style we came to try out sweet poke. The staff were ALL SO friendly and attentive answering any questions myself or daughter mix friendly staff and great food it quickly became our go to lunch spot! The food is always fresh and delicious! We have yet to have a visit where our expectations were not met. They even go a little extra to give us sliced lemons and first time using drive thru I was unaware you could not personalize a roll or poke  the man working altered one of their menu rolls to fit what I was more craving when he really didn't have to, I understood why they couldn't personalize through the drive thru. None the less the roll on menu was just as good!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best sushi burritos hands down. I used to work for a different sushi place that I will not mention, and this places just completely blows everyone out the water!! Booom!! The place is so clean they have a wide variety of drinks and the staff is so genuine, they're not all fake and stuff they're just amazing knowledgeable and super nice I went in around 11:30ish and it was starting to pick up but man do these workers work fast and efficiently I'm very impressed the owner/mangers should be very proud of their staff, now food wise it's to die for. Is it weird that I'd rather go here then to eat actual sushi? I think NOT!! They have all kinds of fish. Spicy fish regular fish all kinds of fresh toppings I felt like a 5 year old in a candy shop my mouth was watering. I do like how they serve their shrimp temp other sushi burritos shrimp temp tends to get soggy and yuck but this place isn't like that I got home to bite my burrito and it was crunch!! Oh my I can't get over it!! My burrito pretty much disappeared in a matter of 10 min and it was huge!! Portion was great!! They're not all cheap with their ingredients like these other places!! I was so happy!! The pricing was good too I got two burritos for $30 (including the tip on that total) and it's so worth it usually at sushi I'm spending $100! I'm so satisfied deff give this place a try and if you live on the other side of town it's worth the drive!! Thank you guys for amazing food and service. You made my day!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, the food is fresh (from poke, to salsa down to its mixed greens). I am so happy they opened up. What I loved most on top of the food was the great customer service that came with it. I just hope it maintains as the business grows. But if you are in this side of town, definitely try them out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I'm a regular here; at least once, if not twice a week. Employees are friendly, portions are huge, pricing is competitive and the food is absolutely delish. Better than any other poke place I've tried in town. Just wish they'd sell gift cards so I could share with friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST TRY!  I'm pretty sure in the last two weeks my boyfriend and I have been here over 5 times.  The employees actually recognize my boyfriend and remember what he likes to order.  The concept is very unique.  You can create your own Poke bowl or your own sushi burrito picking and choosing your proteins, sauces, and vegetables.  They have menu items with ideas on burritos and poke bowls if you are new as well.  I highly recommend the Shrimp Lover poke bowl.      The staff is always so friendly and accommodating.  The manager is always there and he is always friendly and happy!  I am very weird with my fish so the first time I went they were willing to answer all of my questions and substitute anything I wanted free of charge.  I think the only up-charge is if you want extra protein or more avocado, but they do offer a small portion of avocado with your meal.     The prices are very reasonable for the portions and the fresh ingredients.  This is one of my new favorite places close to my apartment!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome food and staff! First timer and the associates treated me with greatness!! Will definitely come back, friendly service something I love to see is ordering food and making it simple when trying something new and sharing laughs! Thank you again"}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick to go order. There was a few folks in the dining area but I arrived just as a rush was starting so I got lucky.  I opted to make my own bowl and picked the wifey a roll off the board. This is the first time I have had  the new hip version or fish and rice smothered in some form of mayonaise sauce.   The tuna was good. Soft and tasted fresh enough. I was given a very generous portion for the price. The two things turned me off a little was some of the rice was not soft and the sauce which was called \"something something sweet sauce\" was actually a bit spicy.   Having stomach problems this is a big issue and I had to stop eating my meal and toss it out. I would have been really happy if the name of the sauce wasn't misleading and I could have chose another.   If I stop here again I will ask the employee's for more details."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at Sweet Poke, and I loved it! The fish was fresh the serving size was definitely better then a lot of places. The customer service was amazing, extremely friendly gentleman made you feel welcomed as soon as you entered the restaurant. I deff will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Not bad but small portions compared to sushiburrito and Soho. We noticed it was a little warm in the restaurant and told them about it. I had my kids with me and they wanted a sushi roll and I got the bowl to try. I even asked for extra fish for a couple dollars more because I love lots of poke. Well there was more fish in the rolls that my son and daughter had then what was in my poke bowl. I was a little dissapointed especially for what I paid for. The taste of the rolls and poke bowl was good but this place really needs to step it up with the quantity you get for what you pay for. I think this place has potential but I would say down the street at Sushiburrito you will get more for your money and the quality and quantity are so much better. Also employees here do not seem to know their own products they serve when asked about it. I had no suggestions when I asked about what was popular. They really need more training on getting familiar with what they are serving and what is popular."}
{"text":"Not my preferred poke bowl spot in town, but it's the lone option currently available to northsiders. Menu offers DIY bowls and burritos, but I found that the fish wasn't quite as fresh as other places and they were a bit more stingy with toppings/portions than other places with a comparable price point.  I usually build my own bowl, and here the large is $11.50 for three scoops. Glad they offer greens and brown rice as base options. The girl who helped me carefully made sure the protein scoop was perfectly level and even knocked some out before putting it in the bowl, which seemed unnecessary. I like how this spot has several sauce options, but I really didn't care for the wasabi yuzu, which overpowered everything it touched (as did the red onion I added), and the rice wasn't that great- a little dry? Note that options like avocado, masago, and crab are extra.   The bowl I created was good, but my guy was less impressed with his. Service was fairly friendly and helpful, but I do wish that the toppings section toward the end of the line was labelled- I would have added on seaweed salad had I noticed it."}
{"text":"The staff is always pleasant and the service is always fast they also offer free Wi-Fi. I'm a regular and I order sushi burrito almost every week. If you want to speed up your order you can always order online through the website or their app."}
{"text":"Idk what it is, but everytime I eat here I feel sick afterwards.  I get a headache every.single.time.  I'm not sure if the fish is at an appropriate temp or what it is.  I feel fine at other poke joints as well as AYCE sushi.  It's just this place in particular I get sick.  Unfortunate, because I like this place quite a bit.  The proteins I always get is yellowtail, ahi, and salmon."}
{"text":"Very good, I had the shrimp lover and it was amazing. The staff was very friendly and the ingredients tasted fresh."}
{"text":"MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE IS VEGAS!!! I just moved here from Los Angeles and I know poke is the biggest trend right now so it's hard to find really good ones that aren't over priced and missing half the fish selections. This place is amazing! They have so much to choose from as far as proteins, mix ins and toppings. I used to drive 30+ min to my favorite joint in Los Angeles but this is only 10 min away. Super delicious every single time."}
{"text":"Food was ok although smaller portions than other sushi burrito restaurants I have been to. The air conditioning was not working well, 85 in the dining room (106 outside), so we left as soon as we were done eating. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love sweet Poké!! Love it more when you get excellent customer service like we did from Chase. Chase answered any question and did so with a smile. Keep it up Chase, and thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Fresh fish, a wide assortment of toppings, and yummy sauces!!  Prices are pretty reasonable too..Check it out! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service every time!!! Thank you Melissa for great recommendations! Will be back"}
{"text":"First time having POKÉ ...and it is safe to say that I'm obsessed!!!  The nice girl working there this afternoon was very helpful and has a welcoming smile which made me feel like I've been there a million times because she made me feel at ease.. now to the poké, I got the dragon rice bowl and instead of having unagi (eel) I opted for cubes salmon.. put some spinach and everything else except for onions lol.. lemmi tell you, that stuff is ssso good!!! and the price? I wouldn't know where else I can compare to (noob) paid $10 and some change for a small bowl which hit the spot.  So in conclusion.. the poké, customer service and cleanliness of the place gets two thumbs up for me and will be seen there from time to time now lol.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They have a plethora of choices from fish to the sauces! The staff is always very friendly and very helpful and they are always cleaning and constantly changing their gloves, which is great to see. If they only had a location closer to my house!!"}
{"text":"These aren't even real poke bowls which should be FRESH ahi on top of sushi rice. This is just a ahi salad. Don't let white people fool you by capitalizing off of another cultures food (Hawaiian) that they don't even understand. Would honestly like to give this place zero stars because the fish is crap."}
{"text":"I came here today with mixed expectations. I haven't been to a sushi burrito/bowl place or poke place, but I thought this place was yummy!  I ordered the 808 regular bowl for 8.99 because the lady in front of me ordered it and it looked promising. This would have been a 5 star review but the girl the served me was slightly rude to me and another customer. Food was yummy! I think the fish could have been cut a little better,  some pieces were stringy, but taste quality and freshness were on point. Place seemed clean but it is a new restaurant so of course it's clean.   And here is the petty part, maybe I just wasn't in the mood but..      I was at the restaurant around 3:45 and there weren't many other customers. The girl in front said, \"I want everything on it\" & the worker still asked if she wanted certain toppings..... uhhh she said everything on it, and with me she just seemed soooooo inconvenienced that I was ordering food, my goodness.... the guys working were super nice and the red head with the matte magenta nails working cashier was splendid, but this dark haired brunette just couldn't be bothered. Not only that but as she was making my food she didn't seem like she knew the proper procedure to make the bowl, your supposed to mix the sauce with the tuna, not pour it over the bowl but maybe those were too many steps for her to be bothered with. It was a little annoying."}
{"text":"I jus left there and WOW it's so amazing!!! The food is so fresh. I order the SAMBA. Great pick!! The staff was so knowledgeable and helped me with all my questions!!! I will be going there all the time!!!"}
{"text":"I had a couple orders with mistakes on it... and after talking to Nick, the manager, I was a happy camper.  He addressed my concerns professionally.  I still love this place... I will continue to come"}
{"text":"Really Really Really good.  Been coming here regularly since they opened and have found the consistency to be always on point.  Fresh items and lots of variations to chose from.  Very attentive service and great food..You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Ordered a sushi burrito with salmon, cream cheese, seaweed salad, cucumber, Tamago and chipotle sauce. So delicious. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Nothing special. It is what you would expect from a pop-up poke place."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of poke style tuna but decided to try this. Wow was this place great! I had a sushi burrito, like a hand roll but with so much more! Very fresh tuna and yellowtail, lots of veggies and different sauces. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"So I decided I to go with the Poke Bowl:  Base: - Seaweed wrap  Proteins: - Salmon - Tuna X2 - Spicy Tuna - Tofu  Sauces: - Spicy Garlic - Creamy Jalapeño  - Chipotle Mayo   Toppings: - Seaweed (salad) - Cilantro - Onions - Fried onions  - Masago  - Green Onions   I thought it came out pretty good. I probably wouldn't get Spicy garlic sauce in it again but wasn't tooo bad with it. Service was good, nice new & clean place located right in front of UNLV."}
{"text":"Loved it.  The staff is very friendly and courteous.  They will let you taste the different sauces before you commit to one.  I like that I can order it online and set my pick up date and time."}
{"text":"Sweet Poke is still our favorite!  My last Sweet Poke bowl was scallops, tuna, salmon, masago, crab and LOADED with veggies!    My son says he loves the freshness - you know the seafood is well treated and fresh.  He tried and loves the spicy tuna."}
{"text":"We go to Sweet Poke on Rainbow probably 2x a week.  It is fresh and SOOOO yummy.  My son gets the eel, spicy tuna, octopus, and salmon with mango salsa and LOTS of veggies.    Me, I like double tuna, salmon, mango salsa, lots of veggies, the sesame rice and yum yum sauce.  One awesome thing - this location has authentic Japanese tea. You can get the green tea cold and taste the matcha - so you know it's real.   The people who work there are super nice and have good recommendations."}
{"text":"When you are the first person to greet the customers.... Employee needs to SMILE. Don't roll your eyes because we are deciding what we want in our burrito or bowl. Even if food is fantastic.... CUSTOMER SERVICE plays the BIGGEST roll of wanting people to return!!!  #WhiteGirlNeedsToSmileAndBeMoreFriendly"}
{"text":"This hands down is one of the freshest sushi places around.I love how we can customize our sushi wrap from A to Z.Service was super prompt and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Wow. I think is my favorite poke place by far.   I came in around 6pm and it wasn't packed at all, which I was happy about so I could order to-go. I was greeted right away. I ordered a Salmon Shaka bowl, size regular. I got all the fixings on it with added spicy mayo sauce on top of the sweet poke sauce that already comes with the bowl. It was on a bed of white rice sprinkled with furikake, a scoop of regular crab (not the spicy one), avocado, and cucumber.   I rushed home to eat it while I watched Westworld, lol. The fish was so fresh and the sauces made the flavor amazing. I absolutely love how there's tempura flakes in the mix... it adds great texture and crunch to the meal.   I'm definitely coming back here to try the sushi burritos and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Eh, this place was OK. The quality of food was great, fresh tasting fish! I love that you can do brown rice instead of white &there are definitely a lot of choices.  HOWEVER, if you've been to SOHO burrito, this place can't really even compare. I took my burrito home, only to realize that it was half ass cut in half and then fell completely apart. Basically ended up having a bowl anyways lol. SOHO has an entire burrito wrapping machine which is genius.  The kids who work there don't really have much experience and knowledge about what pairs well.  It's in a great location though! We don't have many places like this on our side of town."}
{"text":"The staff is always very happy and they seem to enjoy customer service. They are never out of anything. I love the Sweet Poke House Sauce. When I get a salad I ask them to put extra on the lettuce mix. Yummy, also the soft shell crab here is great. I could eat just a bowl of the seaweed salad. I recommend the spicy crab too, it is the perfect amount of spicy. I always build my own but when I don't want to think I get the Spider. Perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Since I saw the sign for this place to up, I've been cruising by periodically to find out when it opened.  Finally I lucked out!  Got the Dragon Burrito with no crab but extra unagi. Very tasty! Tuna was fresh but I did notice they reheated the unagi in a little oven on the wall.  The inside is very nice and minimally decorated currently.  Was a few people in front of me and some seemed newer to the sushi burrito life. Some employees are definitely trying to find their groove here as I did have to point out the unagi for my burrito.  My second visit was an online order that was promptly ready at the time specified and everything was correct.  Definitely see more visits in the future for this place."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to finally have a spot like this on this side of town!!! I love that you can add avocado free of charge and that spicy tuna/crab is added but not counted as one of your meat servings.   I got a large bowl with salmon, yellowtail and soft shell crab. My brother got a burrito with tuna, salmon and yellowtail. The bowl seemed to be much more filling, so I would recommend that over the burrito if you are coming in hungry. The house poke sauce was delicious!! It is sweet with a nice light spicy kick.   You can fill your sushi cravings without having to stuff yourself at an AYCE restaurant. I definitely recommend Sweet Poke, and it will be a go-to spot for me whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here 1-3 times a week for a few months and I LOVE this place. I've always had a great experience here! The only reason I give 4 stars is because I just had an awful experience there. My bowl was being made by a girl there with a nose ring, I didn't catch her name. Not only was she extremely rude, she completely messed up my bowl and walked off in the middle and had some other guy finish it. He was also pretty rude and seemed annoyed with me because I asked them to correct what the bowl was missing.   Other than this experience, I absolutely love all the other staff and the food is amazing!! I'm probably going to stray away for a while because of my experience today, but I'll probably come back just because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"I was really craving poke and found them really close by my area, it's an build your own poke bowl or burrito, I had the poke bowl with yellowtail and salmon, insanely delicious.   Friendly owner & staff, welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"So let me just say - OMG! I'm so jealous of the gem that is Sweet Poke! I WISH that a place like this existed in my town! The ladies behind the counter were so sweet and patient with my sister and I! They have so many fresh and unique ingredients, all for $9.50! I made my own sushi burrito with unagi and salmon. You get two scoops of fish and a topping i.e. spicy crab/spicy tuna. Cream cheese is extra but avocado isn't! You also choose green onions, seasoning, etc. They have MANY different sauces to choose from and various veggies (cucumber, carrots, seaweed salad, fried onions, etc).  The location is VERY clean and modern and the customer service is excellent. Highly, highly, highly recommend! Love!"}
{"text":"Well, the lunch rush was almost entirely Hawaiians, so that pretty much speaks for the food. Good sized portions, tons of great extras like avocado to throw in at no extra charge, and the fish was nice and fresh. My bowl was $9 and more than enough to eat.  Try the 808 bowl, the crispy chili flakes were unique!"}
{"text":"Great place !! Centennial area needed a great poke place. Fresh seafood and they have a great variety of toppings.    Updating my review ... I really LOVE this place. I'm here at least once a week. But I've complained to the manager before about a girl with really long hair.  He doesn't have her pull and twist her hair completely up. He clearly sees her working but things haven't changed. They wear a visor which her hair is in a pony tail but that pony tail still hangs almost to her waist. The girl is short and her hair tends to touch the food counter !!! Not sure why he hasn't corrected this. It's pretty nasty to have hair touching the food counter or even have her hair touching the food (which happened when I first complained to manager )"}
{"text":"customer service is bad.   no thank or appreciation received,  even with just a simple smile.   i thank the girl many times and no response.   im not going back here.  my first and last.   food is ok.   my friend had the same experience with the same girl."}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly my favorite pokebowl/sushi burrito place in the area (I've been to 3 others). First off, the prices are pretty reasonable, about 11$ for a large poke bowl (with three proteins). That's about what I would spend anywhere else considering that other places usually charge for some of toppings Sweet Poke gives for free.  I've been here a few times already, the staff is friendly and always complies with what you ask for. Sometimes, a few members seem to be a little lacking in energy, but they're still really polite and nice.   The food itself is amazing. I usually build my own poke bowl. My typical order is 2 scoop of ahi tuna and unagi on brown rice, but I've also tried their shrimp tempura and salmon. Fish always tastes really good, last time I ordered it the tempura tasted a little bland though, not bad but not amazing (probably because it sits with the other protein choices on the bar and is reheated)  My favorite part is definitely the sauces and toppings though. I've tried their ginger shoyu, unagi (eel sauce), spicy mayo and their creamy jalapeño. The creamy jalapeño is definitely my favorite. I always ask them to put some of the sauce on the rice since they'll typically only toss it with the fish. The variety of toppings they have is amazing! And as I mentioned before, unlike most places, they won't charge extra for a scoop of certain toppings! (Surimi crab/spicy tuna/spicy crab, seaweed salad, avocado).   I would also recommend trying their taro chips. They have a nice texture and taste and come with that creamy jalapeno sauce to dip it in.   I always look forward to stopping in!"}
{"text":"Another Yelp search and BAM= Sweet Poké for lunch, it is. Living in the the North West area of Las Vegas, I was super happy to have found this spot. It's in the Centennial Shopping Plaza beside Smashburger and a threading/henna shop. The place was super clean, a lot of people working the counters and organized. More people working meant for a quick point at what we wanted and we were ready to sit and enjoy. We got 2 regular bowls and 1 large bowl. Various proteins, sauces and toppings, that I don't even remember who got what. The quality of the proteins were real good. Next time, I wanna give their seasonal watermelon item a try. I'm deff gonna be back!"}
{"text":"I'm just here to mention the anticucho sauce. The only anticucho sauce I know is an ají panca-based marinade for a traditional Peruvian dish of barbecued cow hearts. It seems out of place for a poké bowl place, but it adds so much flavor to my veggie sushi burritos and it's very unique and not spicy.  I don't eat fish, not a fan of poké; I'd like to see more vegetarian and vegan options but I always have a great meal when I come to Sweet Poké. I like my sushi burritos with soy paper, sushi rice, tofu, cucumbers, avocado, lettuce, purple cabbage, mango, and whatever else looks good. Order sauces on the side."}
{"text":"A healthier choice for dinner. Love that this is one of my sons favorite choices for dinner as well.   Greeted with a friendly hello and smile as we walk in. Establishment is clean, open and inviting.   First you pick roll (sushi burrito) or bowl. Various bases offered rice, tofu, chips or salad. As far as proteins (fish) they have tons! Yellowtail is our favorite! Then on to the sauces. We have been here a few times so we try new concoctions but tend to favor the wasabi yuzu and spicy ginger shoyu. They let you sample the sauces so try them first if you are curious. Last the toppings, seriously they have tons! Actually more than any other poke place I have been too. Spicy tuna and crab are part of the toppings so you really end up with more protein. Favorite toppings garlic chips and mango salsa! Try them!"}
{"text":"Love the burritos here!  Reasonable pricing for fantastic fresh food.  It's hard getting something healthy on the go but now I can! Was in and out in under five minutes. Decided to have a poke bowl earlier and I will definitely be back for more.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and were able to accommodate any request I had."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Had been waiting on this place to open for weeks!  I first noticed the modern design and welcoming feel. Greeted promptly by the staff. There was a decent sized line when I walked in so there had to be something about this place. I had the 808 bowl and it was amazing! The staff was very helpful with any questions I had. Loved that I could even customize their menu items at the end. 5 stars for the service.  10 stars for the food!  Left with a happy tummy. Would recommend for everyone to come in and try it."}
{"text":"I first came here last month based on the reviews... AndI have been back at least once if not twice a week since. Staff is great, dining room is great & food is excellent... They recommend the dragon roll during my first visit & so far that's all I've ordered. So much flavor & it fills you up!"}
{"text":"Not much to say other than...I'm gonna need to get more!  It was fast and exactly how I wanted it. I mean, you get to choose each individual ingredient from the type of wrap to the choice of white or brown rice to the main ingredient to the sauce to the 'fixings'. If you don't like it, it's your fault, lol.   It was fresh which is one of the most important things here.   The only thing ( I mean the ONLY thing ) I would change was the seating. Yeah...that's it. The seats go right up to the counter which is sort of blocking the aisle there but that's an easy fix. And, part of me thinks they did that so people will know where to enter.   There's basically only a two ways to get it - wrap or bowl.   I don't really like how they call them burritos because that implies that it's Mexican...when it's not. Besides, the idea of burritos were actually first made in Korea as street food centuries before Mexico was even a country. But, that isn't going to change that I like what I'm getting."}
{"text":"From one sushi lover to another. YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!!!!   To start off, It's very different. I was a little bit overwhelmed at first. So many different choices. I told the girls working that it was my first time and I needed some help. They were so kind and gave  some great advice.   I got 1 burrito and 1 bowl. And my boyfriend got 2 burritos. Their ingredients are so fresh! The sauces were so yummie! And the fish was great!!!!!  Plus they have great portions!!!!  To great service, great food! This place is my new favorite!!!!! Give it a try! I'm sure you'll fall in love like we have!!!"}
{"text":"Got the 808 bowl and it was fantastic. Unlike some of the reviews I'm seeing ~ the customer service we received from the guys working when we went in (Saturday afternoon) was fantastic! They customized the bowl my fiancé ordered the way they said they make it for themselves and he loved it! They were helpful and friendly~ since we have never been there before! We will definitely Be back!"}
{"text":"We came here after going to the gym, I had the samba sushi roll. All the ingredients were fresh, there wasn't a lot of rice on the sushi roll which is good, the bowl is something I definitely want to try next time."}
{"text":"I was very excited once this place opened. My brother and I came to try it out hoping it would be like jaburritos... We were so disappointed with the customer service. We ask what would you recommend/suggest and the answer was whatever you like it's all the same, Great she has NO CLUE how to help a customer that would like to try something new.  the serving sizes were next to nothing at the price they are charging. You might as well go to poke express on Craig and get rice from 808 mixed plate and get your money's worth with the quality."}
{"text":"Wow. Fresh. Fast. And delicious. Really hit the spot. I got a dragon roll. Packed full of little extras. Really tasty and I love how I can still add the extras even with the menu ordered roll."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So good, john, and len are so personable and sweet and take the time to really get your order right! Im a poke addict and this is one of the best in cenntineal hills!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times in five days! I have to admit This Place Is A Must Go To. Great menu when you don't want something hot. The food was fresh and clean and people behind the counter very friendly. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So YES the Poke tour just hit another stop last week. Sweet Poke is one of the latest additions to the Poke action. I always get fired up talking Poke because its one of my favorite things too eat!!!   Sweet Poke the concept is not much different then other Poke restaurants. It build your own style either bowl or burrito action. Or you can order from one off the menu. I ended up going with the 808 bowl for my first time. It combination of spicy tuna and tuna. If ur a fan of tuna this is the one would want to get if picking from the menu. The base I went with White Rice (Chips, Brown Rice, Salad, Organic Tofu, Half-Half), Protein since menu got two different tuna (Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cooked Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Scallop, Shrimp, Unagi), and the topping get choose (Crab, Spicy Tuna). The last step the Sauces (Chipotle Mayo, Eel Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger Shoyu, Wasabi Yuzu, Sweet Poke House Sauce, Creamy Japapeno, Yum Yum Sauce, Creamy Ceviche, Red Anticucho Sauce, Sesame Shoyu). So there definitely not a shortage of options or whatever your Poke combination desires!   The bowls come in either reg or large. I went with the large bowl. Talk about LOT of food. The price for the most part is the same at all the Poke places checked out in Vegas. Some feel not get as much but at Sweet Poke get your money worth. They ask if want furikake on your rice. It might be only 808 thing but not many Poke places offer extra treat on top of your rice. I got bed of lettuce on top of the rice then started putting together the bowl. The tuna believe had the sweet poke house sauce. It had mayo base and super ono. Talk about nice size pieces of tuna. I have this rule with Poke. To start freshness is EVERYTHING and Sweet Poke least for the both tuna (my first visit trust me many more..) fresh, delicious, and legit style 808 poke. Second the cut of the tuna tells me whether they know meaning of Poke. I hate seeing minced tuna pan off as Poke. It should be decent size diced cubes of fresh fish. Sweet Poke it was right between nice diced but nothing tiny. The spicy tuna they just different style so not expecting it diced. Both tuna could just have bowl of each and be in Poke bliss. The toppings again not much different except always couple different ones see from one place to another. I loaded my bowl up with seaweed salad, edamame, cucumbers, and avacado. Lot more you can choose from so am sure something for everyone. Cucumbers, Edamame, and Avacado slices all nice and fresh!!!   All the workers were awesome the whole time being my first visit. They explained everything clearly, and guiding me each step putting my bowl together. The whole staff super friendly. Really the minute walked in warm greeting, never rushed, and not doubt five star service. I love the interior. They have couple professional pictures of the food on the walls single shots. The minute walk in tell new building, new restaurant, and hell of clean just opened. Decent amount of places that can sit down eat unlike other spots.   Sweet Poke out of all the new ones really stands out for me. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is AH-MAZE-ING! I have gluten allergies and they offer gluten free sauce! The food is super fresh, good portions! A little pricey, but when you consider the size and quality compared to going to a full service restaurant it is a great buy! They even have adorable daifuku and roll cakes in the case, mochi, and I think Calpico. The customer service was excellent! The staff was very helpful and friendly in sharing information with me and my party as this was our first visit. Definitely plan on coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have been here 10 times and my next visit is a free sushi burrito thanks to their rewards card.  Everything is so fresh, generous scoops on the protein and lots of veggies to chose from.  Sauces are great too(love the garlic ginger and ponzu sauce)The staff is always friendly. Don't bother going anywhere else as you will be disappointed, I was and will always go here from now on"}
{"text":"I ordered a sad samba burrito. The baked salmon tasted as if it were from a can and on top of that the employee that was making my burrito had to ask someone \"is that the salmon?\" Home boy didn't even know what he was making. The tempura is obviously not freshly made but freshly from the freezer. He then asked if I wanted lettuce then retracted the question by saying to himself, \"WAIT. Does it even come with lettuce?\" He then looked at at little book that is literally on the assembly line then said, \"Oh yeah. It does.\" Then with the same fingers he used to flip through then scroll down on that book, he then touched food back on the line then put it on my burrito. I just thought of this. F**K ME. He then drowned my burrito in sauces.   I got a few sides like the crunchies, avocado and seaweed salad/greens. My goodness. I am not asking for a handful but it was literally a pinch of crunchies. By this time, I was irritated. The over ripe, mushy avocado slices put on my burrito were the small ends of the avocado and only 2 pieces. Like WHY? WHY do you offer such add on's if they're barely even there???  Upon checking out, I noticed they were expanding to my side of town. The girl at the register kept insisting it's not going to be on my side of town (closer to Henderson) but hers. Why would there be two locations of the same restaurant in the same area? I mean, you're not Starbucks, honey.   She came to her senses then realized it really is going to be in on my side of town. SMH. I won't be visiting this location or the new any time ever. I couldn't wait to get out of Sweet Poke. You got my money but you are not getting a two, three, four and definitely not a 5 star review.   ************************************************* Service: Thumbs down, SLOW. Like they don't know what they're doing... like they need to refer to a book... WAIT. True story.  Quality of food: Thumbs down. Food tastes like it's from the can. Shrimp tempura is definitely from the freezer.  Portion: Thumbs down. A sprinkle of this and a smear of that. But lets drown it in sauces so they don't know what flavors they're missing because we are so tight on the portions.   Atmosphere: MEH. Vibes are MEH.  Cleanliness: Gloves only protect YOU when you're touching everything. Not the customer."}
{"text":"My new go to for Poke. The food is very fresh and really good. They have a lot of options, and the service is great.  The 808 bowl is awesome."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  They were stingy with the amount of protein they gave me and there was barely any lettuce in my salad.  The soft shell crab was pretty soggy and cold.  The young kids making the bowls were not very friendly either.  The manager should educate their staff on better customer service!  I dont think i'll be coming back here, since there are much better poke establishments in town!!!"}
{"text":"Though the food is good, this place is not worth anyone's time. The service was slow and terrible. We were the first ones that arrived around 5:30PM, and the staff told us the chicken wasn't ready yet so we would have to wait for that particular burrito. Really? No chicken prepped for a dinner shift? Furthermore, the girl making both burritos had to keep glancing at the menu behind her to see what came with each one. I started to eat my burrito, while my boyfriend was still waiting for his chicken. When his was ready, the girl just held up his burrito in the air without even mouthing a word. She just stared at us. There was no sense of urgency amongst any of the staff members. Not worth the price. We would rather go to a fast-paced chipotle and get that extra guac."}
{"text":"WAY BETTER THAN THE COMPETITORS!!!   To be honest this was the best poke place I have ever been to. Totally blows Soho out of the water. I got the cooked special and it was super delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful-- especially the manager Nick.  I will definitely be coming back for more poke! I'm addicted!!"}
{"text":"UPDATED:  Came back in a few times in the past month and my favorite employee no longer works there. I am disheartened and my Pokè bowls will never be the same. I never asked her name but it was the only blonde girl that works there who always hooked my bowl up and was super nice--- My visits here will be less frequent, although I do LOVE the food :)    ORIGINAL:  Went in here at around 8pm on Saturday and had the best sushi burrito!! The staff was very friendly and they helped me to create my own roll. 5 stars on their employees alone!   The roll was huge and I was able to load it up with extra veggies and sauces at no extra charge. Definitely worth the prices :) The flavor of everything was really fresh and delicious. I had the Citrus Salmon in a roll upon one of the workers recommendation and it was perfect; the mango salsa is a must have!!"}
{"text":"OMG! I couldn't be happier we found this place! We tried it for lunch on day, as we were tired of the same old options in the area. The options are endless. I haven't been disappointed by any of the Bowl or Roll options. I intend on creating my own bowl next week. It's so delicious and fresh, that my office staff and myself have had it 5 times in the last 2 weeks. I can't wait to eat my way through the entire menu!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a hunch, going off what some of my friends had told me, and this place didn't disappoint. This place provided me with a inexpensive lunch that was good quality. Definitely would recommend to anyone that has a taste in sushi or raw fish."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Glad i decided to stop by one day and check it out! My first time i was hooked! Its been a week now since i had Sweet Poke for the first time and  i have been in 4 other times since then! I would give it a 5 out of 5 if they would not have ran out of a few items. Also the size differences between a regular size bowl and a large is confusing, just seems like your paying more for the same amount! But other than that the place is fantastic and i cant wait to have Sweet Poke again!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! First time there and so pleased so worth the money I got a ton of sushi!!!! Love love love & the staff was so friendly I had no clue what I was doing & he talked me through everything! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing excellent customer service friendly staff and the toppings are delicious will definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. So far I have tried the dragon, shirimp lover and spider burrito . The dragon with extra eel sauce is by far my favorite. The only this is they only put 2 pieces of unagi so it is overpowered by the spicy tuna."}
{"text":"We recently found another Sushi Burrito place near the strip that we love, and then found out this place is near our house. We went to give it a try, and it is pretty good! You can choose from one of their pre-thought-up burritos or bowls, or go with make your own. It was very similar taste wise to our favorite place, and prices are also similar. Only thing we didn't like was it seems like their portions are a little smaller, and have less of a selection. Otherwise, it tasted great! Place was clean! Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the food, service, and price are hard to beat . Awesome food!!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant. I had a Ahi tuna salad with whatever I wanted to add to it. Such a variety of great sauces and menu items to eat healthy. I love this place"}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant. I had a Ahi tuna salad with whatever I wanted to add to it. Such a variety of great sauces and menu items to eat healthy. I love this place"}
{"text":"Finally a sushi burrito place close to home. I recommend getting a bowl versus sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Sweet poke is beyond my favorite poke place I've ever been too. They're are a lot of sushi places on this street, and I've been to them all. I always feel so welcomed, I am a regular and I'm never disappointed. The employees are beyond the sweetest people I've ever met, they are so considerate and helpful. The food is to die for, everything is so fresh and taste so good. My personal favorite is the Hamachi son. This is honestly my favorite place to eat, I would highly recommend coming in everything about this place is amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to almost every poke place, and this one is by far my favorite. The food is good and fresh, the people are friendly and helpful. They have all the makings of a perfect restaurant. The only complaint I have is that it's always so busy. I highly recommend coming in, I promise that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved it.  Staff was so friendly and the portions were great.  I had the combo meal and left there stuffed.  The only thing i didn't see while we were there was an employee cleaning the tables or soda fountain area. They both needed some TLC. Other then that it was almost perfect.  We will definitely be going back soon.  So happy to have them on the NW side of town!!"}
{"text":"I had been eyeballing this place for a while before going from a recommendation of a friend. What a great place to fill those quick sushi cravings! And for a reasonable price!  The first time I went, I blurted out that it was my first time and I had no idea what I was doing, and the staff made sure to help me out and walk me through everything. And every time I go in, I see the same situation happening with other customers and every staff member I've seen handle it is always friendly and joyful and willing to help out!   The location is near my work and church, so I tend to drop by if those sushi cravings come up. The restaurant itself is super modern and clean, would totally chill here with a small group of friends with similar tastes.  Only one star off because two times, I've gotten a sushi burrito that wasn't cut all the way and that made a mess of things, but that's a small complaint. Everything else has been great about Sweet Poke! I recommend it to everyone who enjoys sushi!"}
{"text":"I like the concept but I just don't like the tiny scoop of poke portion sizes. Pretty much you get what you pay for. Wishing this place nothing but success but I won't come back."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I had no idea what to order! Beverly was very friendly and sweet, she helped me get exactly what I wanted! I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Build your own sushi burrito any way you want! Tons of seafood, topping choices, amazing sauces and choice of seaweed or soy paper makes about a billion different combos! You can always try one of their pre designed sushi burritos too! I recommend the Vegas or Dragon! It's the best way to eat sushi without chopsticks! Great food and great staff!'"}
{"text":"Update 8/14/16: went in today to get my usual. A couple points off because it was my first bad experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth.... Literally. When I got to the veggies toppings, I usually ask for extra extra seaweed for my husband's bowl. Mind you, he doesn't get a lot of the other vegetables. He simply gets lettuce, and extra seaweed.   They have done it for us a couple times in the past, but today, the guy refused to add more than the one serving they're \"allowed to give\". I had to pay $2 for extra seaweed on the side. I get it. Buuuut, what is the difference between last time we were there and today? Be consistent with your rules among all of your employees. What is the difference between extra seaweed, and packing the bowl with all these other toppings?  Second gripe.... The ahi was so mushy and fishy tasting. I know, I know. It's fish!! But it shouldn't be pungently fishy. The thick cuts of fish being mushy plus the fishiness was not cute today!! I loved this place. I used to come so many times since it just opened, and that's recently. Idk if I can for a very long time.  ...............................................................  I had a great first time experience here. I ordered a Large Poké bowl with 3 scoops of Ahi. Wasn't sure what sauce to get, so I went safely with Ginger Shoyu. I got all the toppings and fixings I knew I'd enjoy with my bowl. The guy was nice enough to let me do half/half of imitation crab and spicy imitation crab as a topping. Next time, I'd try a different sauce and if I do go with the ginger Shoyu again, I'll ask for more.   I'll definitely be returning. Ahi tasted fresh. Note: eat it right away. You don't want the warm rice to warm up the Poké too much."}
{"text":"So.  H20 Poke closed and I was left with very little poke options at work.  A friend of mine told me to stop at Sweet Poke and to by honest I was a little reluctant because I wasn't a huge fan of the Sweet Poke in Centennial.  Not sure why but this one is wayyyyy better.  Not as great as To See Roll, but definitely a nice option if I really have a craving at work."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was delicious. Great alternative to Subway. Usually when my nephew goes to Smash Burger, I will run over to Subways. But now I have a new spot. I ordered the Seattle Bowl and became instantly hooked. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food with plenty of options, and reasonable prices. Can't go wrong with the food here. Id definitely try the Dragon Roll if you're a doubter."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Not as much fish as I thought I would get but it was very tasty and I felt full but not unhealthy full at the end. I got the 808 large."}
{"text":"Portions are much smaller compared to Jaburrito and yet my sushi burrito was more expensive here. I asked for cream cheese and was given the smallest stick of it that I can barely taste it in my roll. $1 extra for that pathetic strand? No thanks I'd much rather travel a little farther and get better food for less."}
{"text":"There's some pretty good Poke places back where I'm from but when I'm in town I go to Sweet Poke. This location is really friendly, serves you a lot of protein, and best of all it tastes great. I love, love, love getting avocado to top off my bowl! I would definitely recommend trying out this location for people who want to try a Poke bowl for the first time, and even for seasoned Poke-lovers who look for large portions a.k.a. bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"My parents and I are in town to visit my brother who lives near this area. I absolutely love sushi/poke, I get it all the time in San Diego. My brother is a regular at this place, so I decided to give this place a try. The fish is fresh, the environment is clean, the staff is helpful and friendly. It was my first time ever trying the sesame sauce, it was absolutely addicting. Wish they had one where I lived."}
{"text":"Great \"poke\" place. It has everything from rice to fresh veggies. Great concept where you can choose what you want in your meal. Fish is well seasoned, but my rice was a little dry. Sauces were nice, miso soup was good,and the veggie chips are great. Overall, great experience, but need to do some quality control over the items being offered. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place and I always come here when I want a poke bowl. I am always here. The last time I was there though I ordered the samba with spicy crab. After eating it, I felt completely awful. I started throwing up and I just didn't feel good. I was very disappointed because this is my favorite place."}
{"text":"I've ate at other sushi burrito spots and this one so far is the best. It's always so fresh and the choice of ingredients is really good. They have their own burritos you can choose or you can make your own from your choice of seaweed or soy paper. They even have kids meals which my son loves. What I love about this spot is not only the choice of fresh proteins (fish) but they also pack it in the sushi burritos too!"}
{"text":"We go to this place at least once a week, the staff is amazing and the food is outstanding. This is a place where you truly pay for what you get. Will be a loyal customer for many more visits!"}
{"text":"This place is delicous. Super fresh ingredients, friendly staff and all around great experience. Josh a.k.a reggae is the most helpful employee I've encountered, helped us make our decisions and was pleasant the entire time. The man deserves a raise or promotion.   If you're in the area I highly recommend trying this place out. And the sesame shoyu sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"It seems my earlier review got the owner's attention.  I have revised my rating to reflect a new commitment to cleanliness and food safety.  I would not hesitate to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is so great i come in everyday and i get the best consistent about of food in my burrito. It looks like a really good place to work too, the employees are very nice and provide excellent service!"}
{"text":"Holy poke batman! This is the place to stop and grab an amazing bite of goodness o grabbed a late night sushi burrito to eat while on the run. The darn thing tasted so good it didn't make it out of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Thanks Chase! Great food amd friendly place. My son's love coming here all the time. Great food and great price."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having a sushi burrito and this place exceeded my expectations. The Dragon was everything I could have ever asked for in a burrito. It was filled with eel, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, avocado, green onions, eel sauce and chipotle mayo. I also added seaweed salad, spinach, tempura crunchies and crispy onions. It was absolutely amazing. I loved how there was a variety of options and the fact that you could create your own burrito. The staff was nice and the restaurant was very clean. The only thing I wish was that I got a second sushi burrito to take home. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's 330pm on 12/11 and the 2 young girls working are just giggling and having a conversation between each other and haven't even acknowledge me standing waiting to order! No one else is in the establishment!  Finally after several mins and me asking if I can order, one of the girls finally acknowledges me!  As I'm ordering, I'm constantly repeating my order to her because she is still having her personal conversation with her coworker!   As I check out my order,  the girl notices I'm displeased with the service and she gives a 1/2 attempted apology about them giggling!   During my time in the restaurant, a male came out from the back and asked if they had enough of the giggles! He then retreated back to the back.   If it wasn't for the promise of bringing  food to a friend, I would've definitely walked out!  There is so many other poke bowl/burrito establishments in this town!!!   I hope you take this criticism and train your staff to be professional!!!!"}
{"text":"All of the food is really refreshing and new. Also, the concept of the food is something I haven't seen before. This place is definitely a new gem in the heart of Northwest Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is simple and clean. The food is great and the service is even better. I'm glad I took the opportunity to eat at Sweet Poke. I will definitely visit there again...."}
{"text":"To be honest..compare to To See Roll on rainbow. Sweet Poke is better taste and value. More protein and topping choices and more flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"i love coming here! i take my family here all the time. my mom and i always come here after she gets off from work. every time my relatives come in town i take them here first and they love it. we usually create our own but my aunt loves the shrimp lover. i recommend getting the burrito with soy paper and getting salmon and tempura shrimp with the yum yum sauce and chipotle mayo. they have a list of sauces you can choose from unlike some other poke places that only have a few and they can let you taste as well, but the yum yum sauce is really good if you like something on the sweeter side, and i LOVE LOVE LOVE their taro chips especially when you dip it in the creamy jalapeño sauce, and the lychee ramune is a really good drink as well. there may be a line when you come for lunch or dinner but its worth the wait! the workers are always welcoming and sweet. i highly recommend you guys to come here!"}
{"text":"I'm super happy that a poke place has finally taken a scene in Las Vegas, and it's close to my house to boot!  The seating arrangement is a lot better than some other poke/ sushi burrito establishments which is always nice. The quality is pretty good especially considering you're paying a modest price for what you get.  I got the citrus salmon bowl which is excellent. The presentation is pretty nice as well. I only wish the charge for extra protein was a little lower, $2.50 for some extra fish is quite expensive. When the large bowl is already $11.50, which is already $2.50 more expensive than the regular, you're charging practically for a whole bigger bowl when in actuality you're only getting one more scoop of fish.   The staff is nice and courteous. They always seem to be in a good mood which always helps with the entire ambiance of the place. The open fridge idea is nice especially since some of the items are speciality drinks that most Asians like to drink."}
{"text":"I had 808 Bowl, A must Try !!!  I love this one, I brought my friends to, They also Enjoy very much, Thank you, Service was very good and Nice Clean Atmosphere. I be a Repeat Customer, I was also Happy to hear 3 Locations for Sweet Poke in Las Vegas will be here, 215 And Eastern and 215 Southwest Location off Rainbow."}
{"text":"I'd really love to rate Sweet Poke with much more than 3 stars, however it seems that the staff doesn't really know their own menu making service extremely slow and honestly quite frustrating.  All that aside though, the pre made menu items are tasty and also customizable like most of these places in town.  Don't let the name fool you, they also offer sushi burritos as well. My only gripe is that the nori (seaweed) wrapper on the sushi burrito isn't crispy, nor is their an option for that.   Otherwise, the portions are large and worth the money and you can even get different sizes of Poke Bowls.   The dining area isn't too large so prepare to wait for a spot to sit or get your stuff to go if it's really busy.  A little hard to find but GPS should help you out there. The sign isn't all that big outside but if you look for O'reilly Auto Parts, they're in the same plaza.  I've only ever had the Las Vegas Burrito and the 808 Poke Bowl and both in my option were great!   Like I said, the only reason this place gets 3 and not more stars from me is the service. I know they're new but I feel like the staff should readily know their menu and not constantly ask what you'd like inside of your order (especially when you're ordering something from their preset menu and not customizing)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Seems like I end up here once or twice a week. The staff is super friendly and efficient. The food is amazing. I always make my own bowl and love that I can customize it to my nutritional needs of the day. My daughter and husband love it also! For my daughter I typically order one of the burritos and they last her at least two meals!   It really nice to be able to fulfill my sushi cravings in an affordable way, and I'm able to keep it super healthy on top of it. I recommend this place to anyone looking for for a quick, healthy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review on this place.  There was an instance where I ordered 5 rolls. The guy at the register said \"did you order enough?\" I think he was being sarcastic but I didn't appreciate that comment. He made me feel bad for ordering a lot and probably holding up the line. I paid $50+ for that and felt bad for ordering 5 (to share with my family)!   Another instance, I used their online ordering service, for the sole reason that the food would be ready when it was time to pick it up. When I got there, instead of a bowl, they made a roll. I had to wait in line and get my order made.  Again, I use their online ordering service (on 3-26), so that the food would be ready by the time it said it would be ready by (45 minutes after ordering time.)  I don't know if any of you order via their website, but it has a section where you could put a different \"pick up by\" name. I had my fiance pick it up so I put his name.  When he gets there, 1 hour 15 minutes later, they couldn't find it under his name and told him that I probably ordered for a different location, skipped him/disregarded his issue and went on helping the next person in line. He calls me up, I tell him to try my name, he tells me they aren't even acknowledging his presence, had to get someone's attention to tell them to look up my name. They found my name, BUT the food was not even made.  During that time, I called to ask what was going on. I spoke with John \"Directives manager\" who was very rude and had an attitude over the phone. He told me \"we were busy and I already gave a coupon for a BOGO. So what is the issue?\" I asked for the owner's name, but he was hesitant to tell me. Then he tells me he's the manager and asks why do I need to know their names. Sassy much? If he didn't speak with attitude, I think the conversation would have been tolerable and I would have understood that it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes to make 2 bowls-that came with directions!  The cherry on top was... When I got my bowl they forgot my avocado!   Dear Freddy & Eric, Please include customer service as a priority in your business. I've had 3/5 bad experiences here! Once was enough, but I still gave this company the benefit of the doubt. Please look into your online ordering service, Chownow, and why it doesn't show \"pick up by name\" and uses the person who ordered it. That way there won't be any confusion for customers/staff members. Otherwise, remove that section online where it asks that. Have your staff acknowledge waiting guests and greet them as they come to the line. Little things like that go a long way.  Thank you."}
{"text":"My husband and daughter swear by this place! The staff is always nice and helpful. My husband says the portion size of the seafood is well worth the money. He also says it's very fresh  and it doesn't have that stale taste that some places having when they serve not so fresh fish. My daughter loves the soy paper option. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"First of all I'm NOT a fan of  or sashimi, only cooked rolls or semi.   I only tried this place bc my niece worked there.    The first time.. I had her make me a bowl of salad w  and salmon mixed w spicy mayo and other things..  I like the  to it but other then that it's not my type of food.   Yeah it's healthy and all and it's popping up in every corner.    My second time I had the burrito with crab, and it turn out SOO much better then the .  So from 3  to 4 ..  it's big and really tasty, I could only finished half.  The taro chips is really good as well!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place on my way to another restaurant and pulled around here instead. I was excited to try it. I brought my wife and we were really impressed. We usually go to a sushi place we were regulars at for 16 years that had been recently disappointing us and I think we found our new spot! This place is amazing! Fresh ingredients, tasty food, my sushi burrito was all of my favorite rolls put into one giant burrito! The line was long when we came in and were eating in less than 5 minutes even with all the questions we had, the staff was really friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first create-your-own poke bowl experience, and it was a good one. You can create your own bowl or poke burrito, or select from one of their menu options if you're not sure where to start. A regular with 2 scoops is $9.50. This was my selection and I was so full, I couldn't even finish it. I would have been happy with one scoop, but that isn't offered. You have a choice between 8 raw fish options, and an extensive and varied sauce selection. The fish was really fresh and the sauces are unique and tasty. Their additional topping offerings are plentiful, so you can really end up with a hefty bowl. Make it a combo with a side and a drink if you so desire. I went with the Miso Soup and the portion was a lot larger than I expected! The taste was great, filled with plenty of seaweed and tofu. My friends are regulars here for the poke burritos and always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We walked in and the place was really warm, I'm not sure if their AC went out but man was it uncomfortable in there, shout out to the kids working behind the counter because I hardly wanted to wait in line in that heat let alone move around.  The service was pretty slow, partially due to the people in front of us not knowing what they wanted, they were out of a lot of items on the menu and also it's brand new and there's bound to be growing pains.  I was really surprised there was no one on duty that seemed to be in charge, there was no one there to help the employees along or try and get the line moving faster.  We got our bowls to go and the food was great, it really made up for the fact that the service was slow and it being hot af.  I would recommend putting more sauce on top of the lettuce just because it was really dry, I ended up just removing the lettuce altogether, my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the kale, I didn't think he would be...I'm not even sure why he got that on his bowl to begin with lol.  All in all we would eat here again.  There's A LOT of poke spots opening up so I hope they get it together quickly."}
{"text":"Im not a fan of raw fish, so I did not anticipate liking this place but I was wrong! They have a few cooked options, like salmon and tempura shrimp, and endless combinations. Style is like Chipotle where you customize everything, which is fun and allows for a lot of experimentation."}
{"text":"I'm actually super upset right now. Me and my son come here once a week for dinner however last night he had a family event so I went this afternoon to keep up with our weekly tradition and as my boel was being made I was told that I could no longer have any sauce on my rice and also the scoops of protein were much smaller than they have been in the previous few months that we've been going and when I asked if there was a reason why they were building the bowl so small and so different I  was told that they had a meeting this morning and had to watch portions, also their bowls have gotten smaller. I understand watching portions as I own my own business as well, however I don't understand cutting back so much so that it is any actual visual difference where two pieces of avocado were given instead of 4 or 5, the scoops are much smaller and the sauce is actually regulated to only be on the protein mixture and nothing on the rice creating a very dry bowl. I hope that this is a temporary setback and not going to be the normal for this place as I know I was pretty upset with my order this afternoon and will try one more time however if it doesn't change we will be finding a new poké place."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get lunch. I've been to other poke places but this one tastes the best. The worker Chase seems genuinely kind and friendly which is hard to find in customer service. I'll keep coming back fa sho!"}
{"text":"I thought it was extremely inviting with a cool and upbeat exterior. The workers are extremely friendly and helpful. The food is absolutely delicious. Although, if youre picky I recommend to make your own burrito. I definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Chipotle-style poke joint. It's located across from the Smith's on S Rainbow. They just opened a week ago and I have to say, pretty good! I ordered a salmon salad bowl and the fish was very fresh, which always boggles me out here in the desert. The regular bowl is $8.99 and large is $10.99 I believe, and portions are fair. There are combos or you can choose your base (salad, rice, tofu, etc) and build your own bowl or sushiritto as well. Seems like poke spots are poppin up all over the place here and I can't say I'm mad at that!"}
{"text":"Sweet Poke just opened last week, was driving by and saw the sign and had to stop and try it. The place is empty but probably because it has only been open for a week and not many people know about it yet. Had the Sushi burrito and seaweed salad combo.  Think of the burrito like am over stuffed Maki roll that they roll into a burrito, the nori takes the place of the tortilla, you can get any filling you want. I had Ahi Tuna, Crab, furikake, Chipotle Mayo, green onion and cucumber."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING!!  I've been wanting to come here since before it opened, and I decided today was the day. I sure am glad I made that decision.  As soon as you walk in, the greeting from the staff makes you feel so welcomed. They were extremely helpful in explaining the menu and allowing us a few moments to let us figure out what we'd like.  I ended up getting the Shrimp Lovers roll, and my partner had a custom roll with Unagi. And yay. The staff didn't give me any funny looks when I asked for no Avocado. :)  We made one roll into a combo #4, which comes with a drink and seaweed salad.  Simply put, these rolls were AMAZING. They were bursting with flavour, and were filled to the brim with sushi goodness. The Yum Yum sauce on mine added a touch of sweet that went great with the spicy crab.  My partner's Unagi roll was just an utter delight. The eel tasted fresh, and the eel sauce added the perfect tangy kick. But don't forget the seaweed salad! YUM!  Overall, this place gets a perfect 5 from me. From friendly and well educated staff to amazingly fresh and delectable food, this is my new go to lunch and dinner spot. Be prepared to see me a lot Sweet Poke!"}
{"text":"Just Meh. Not the worst sushi burrito you'll get but not something you'd rave about for days till you came back (like other places in the LV, *ahem* Soho)  The restaurant is small and the dining area can seat around 24 or so. The dining area was clean though I never saw anyone come through and wipe down tables.   Ordering was relatively simple but other customers seemed confused by the protein and topping concepts (since the toppings are protein?). I didn't understand why my burrito crafter was asking me what I wanted on my burrito when I ordered the \"Diego\".  Service was a little slow.   The food prep area seemed clean and organized.   The servers were not rude but they must have been tired or annoyed at the previous customers since I never saw one of the 3 ladies crack a smile at all. My crafter didn't seem too familiar with their offerings. Have you tried the taro chips yourself?  The Diego was rolled well by hand (despite some of the other reviews praising Soho's rolling machine) and my burrito held together just fine. I did think the rice was a bit dry (C'mon! Good rice is what MAKES sushi great!). My yellowtail and spicy tuna was fresh and flavorful.   They keep the wasabi and ginger behind the counter so you have to ask for it. The wasabi had the consistency of playdough so I think they must make it from powder.   I did appreciate the combo options they have (Soho doesn't have as many).   You can expect to drop $10-12 on food here, about average for this kind of offering.   Overall a fair experience. I would come back since it's the only option on the north side for this kind of offering. That is unless Soho opened a location in Centennial. ;)"}
{"text":"Okay this place is fucking amazing from the sushi burritos to the poke bowls. They only is the past couple of visits I've had the same person helping me, who happens to have an attitude and love to roll her eyes. Here's a tip don't like your job quit."}
{"text":"I come for the create-your-own bowls, not the burritos. The fish is always thick-sliced, fresh, and the scoops are liberal. Here you can get a Lg order with three proteins, plus some surimi crab for no extra charge. This will fill you up. Unlike most other places they mix your proteins in whichever sauce(s) you choose. They have tons of options of great sides you can choose from including seaweed salad (which doesn't cost extra). Easily my poké fix place when you're craving that AYCE sushi but don't want to spend as much $$$. ***written at a Jaburritos, missing Sweet Poké***"}
{"text":"This place is great! I go here after training and it's a great place to pick up and go. The food portions are big enough and the Freddy,Alex and the staff are very welcoming. I will be coming back here to eat."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! Amazing, fast service! Chase is friendly and  Courteous! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Next time please let customers know if you've run out of something!!! Not after I've ordered.....................  Edit : mostly because I can't just leave w review based off of just service.   Ordered a large hamachi San bowl and a dragon burrito. Bowl definitely needed some sauce of some sort but used pretty fresh ingredients. The burrito was pretty good but the eel they put into it still had some bones left in it. Yikes!!!!   Overall, I am not sure if I will be back again but it was worth trying."}
{"text":"Sushi available in a subway-esque, build your own roll style setting.  You pick the seaweed or rice paper wrapper then the proteins, veggies, seasonings and sauce.  Built and rolled immediately before your eyes within a moment.  Cut in half as a sushi burrito or cut like a traditional roll.  Not to mention they are BIG ROLLS.  Eating fresher couldn't be more easy or delicious!  Located strategically across from UNLV and in the same shopping center as one of the trendiest Vape shops and a Boba store.  I couldn't be more thrilled to come across Sweet Poke!  As of late I have returned to a pescetarian diet, meaning no meat, only seafood proteins.  This is now my only fast-food.  The atmosphere is casual and the decor is ambient.  The service is refreshingly pleasant.  All high marks so far.  There is a small dining area, enough for a quick lunch or between classes bite.  Did I mention there is a drive thru?  Have a certain favorite sushi roll?  It's probably on the menu already.  You can just pick away at the menu or if you're like me than you'd rather individually pick out your dream sushi roll from all the standard sushi ingredients.  All of this is also available in a poke or SUSHI BOWL, kinda like a Japanese salad.  I haven't tried this yet.  They also have pork or chicken TERIYAKI BOWLS with rice.  Then to round things out you can even order some good looking RAMEN too.  My favorite is a large sushi burrito with:  seaweed wrap - black rice seasoning - soft-shell crab - Unagi (bbq eel w/sauce) - Yellowtail - Wasabi Aioli - green onions - smelt eggs - spicy crab - cucumber - jalapeno - seaweed salad - garlic chips   Good sh*t!  With the new quick-hit generation these days, a place like this is poised to fulfill the gap between wanting better specialty food - and not wanting to go through the whole sit down experience.  Try Sweet Poke once and you will return again and again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the rebel combo with one sushi burrito and small ramen. I really liked the ramen. It was perfectly season! :) but it is really small just an FYI. The staffs were really friendly and nice. They made recommendations and even asked us for the rebel card to get a discount. I will recommend this place and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Fresh and great-tasting poke bowl. I always walk out the door very satisfied! Customer service is A1 as well. Also in love with the sauce they mix my proteins with -chipotle mayo & eel sauce"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today. Was not disappointed! I think this is my new favorite poke place. The girl behind the counter was super nice, walked me through the menu. I ordered to 808 bowl and it was delicious. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Yummy! I was so tired of my kids wanting to go to fast food or get pizza.... And finally they can actually request a healthier option here at Sweet Poke! It's clean, friendly and fast service. My twelve year old brother loves this place and my four year old son does too.  If only Sweet Poke would have iced tea available (no soda or red bull), it would be perfect. I hear there's an online ordering system happening soon so I'll order it for lunch :) thanks!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to get poke here! It's less than 5 minutes from our house and it's delicious!! Everything is fresh and reasonably priced! Eat here at least once a week, definetly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of locations and this one always disappoints me. Every time. The employees are rude and the bowls are never fresh tasting. They gave me two iti bity slices of avocado and I asked for extra and they gave me 1 more slice with a side of attitude. Go to a different poke place they have fresher fish and give you more for your money that's for sure"}
{"text":"First Poke Bowl in Vegas and first Sushi Burrito. Fast, clean very friendly staff. Yes, we gave our tip in cash thanks to another smart Yelper. We will be back! Oh, we got a Salmon Burrito and a two scoop Poke Bowl"}
{"text":"Love this place and can't wait to come back! Their sushi burritos are amazing and it's such a great deal considering how much fish you're getting. I think this place is so much better than to other sushi burrito places because they're able to get the rice nice and thin so you have room to get fun with the toppings! Last time I went I remember getting some kind of wasabi chip thing that was SO worth it! Clean location, excellent service, and good quality! What could be better?"}
{"text":"Great new place! Sushi burritos are very good and they was wonderful customer service! Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food. I'm in love with the set up. Tastes great. I love that the brown rice is always nice and soft. Most places always have hard brown rice. So it's nice to have some good rice finally. The shrimp and cooked salmon is frickin delicious with some eel sauce. MmmMmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Wow very good I loved my first poke bowl yummy I will for sure be back and now I'm ready to go nuts in there it's clean and friendly"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review after trying Sweet Poke several times since my last review. I've also compared it to other poke venues around town.  I've found that other poke places suffer from low quality ingredients and it's so evident if you just simply look at the color of the fish. At Sweet Poke I can honestly say they are as consistent as you can be. The unagi (eel) is by far my favorite ingredient here and I love how they warm it up in the toaster oven before serving. The shrimp is very fresh and thinly sliced so it's easy to consume. Don't you hate it when they serve chunks of cold shrimp? None of that here.  Lastly I see that they've added more sauces and I had the garlic sauce which was simply amazing with my poke bowl.  The prices are still a little steep considering the size of the portions. Again, the large is a decent size but the portions of the fish they give you is pretty small. But the quality is well worth it. Ps I see that they have a new lunch menu I'm gonna try out next time: Small bowl of ramen with any order of a reg bowl, burrito or cooked special for only $12 bucks. Considering the large bowl is already $12 bucks, you can enjoy poke and ramen with this special. Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"good enough for me I get served by more experienced staff though.  make sure the recook your eel, rather served straight To your bowl!!! I forgive"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sushi place ever. And it's near my house! The workers were very fast and helpful as it was mine and my moms first time there. I got the sushi burrito and she got the sushi salad. We were able to add things on that I thought would cost extra however when I payed they just charged the flat fee. Definitely my new go to sushi place. Ambience was calm , simple , smelled good, it was great."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is a hole in the wall place for Tonkostu ramen. No lie. It's not only poke.   They let their pork bone broth sit for two days. FOR TWO freaking days. Oh man. I start drooling just thinking about it, even though I just ate it before this review. The creaminess of the pork broth just makes me melt every time. This best of all the best ramen places in town.   Best part yet, their ramen bowl include a half hard boiled egg, corn, green onions...... Dude check out the photo.  All for $7 and they'll apply student discount with your UNLV student card.   If you're a hungry ramen craving student, you don't have to drive very far to Spring mountain just for some overly priced ramen. It's literally right across campus. You're missing out if you give their Tonkostu ramen a try!"}
{"text":"Hipster \"sushi\" has landed in Las Vegas!!  No, just kidding.  But sushi burritos do seem to be a big craze now, much like Boba, FroYo, and AYCE sushi that has become mainstream.  I will offer ONE view to this experience:  as if it were the first time.  For anyone who would prefer my personal preference without a star rating, please ask me separately.  Here goes:  LOCATION Located right in front of UNLV, this place I can see getting quite busy during school hours, especially lunch and early afternoon times.  Beware if you plan to dine during that time.  Any of the restaurants nearby will likely be busy around that time (In N Out, Starbucks, SmashBurger, Chipotle, etc).  Convenient spot, with lots of plaza parking.  Be careful of some drivers; this area is known for bad drivers.  ATMOSPHERE Nothing particularly outstanding, but not bland either.  The place doesn't pop out like a Rainforest Cafe, but it also doesn't make you feel like you're in a basement restaurant in NYC or Berkeley CA.  They play modern hits (I heard a song as far back as 2008 - Boom Boom Pow).  Otherwise everything stayed within the past few years.  Very clean and well presented.  The sushi burrito (also known as SUSHIRRITO or SUSHIRITO) has an a la carte style like Chipotle or Subway would.  You could pick an item from the menu, or make and design yourself with your standard base \"protein\" or \"meat.\"  At the end, there are refrigerators where you can select bottled, can, or boxed drinks, and lastly a dessert freezer with mochi ice cream and macaroons.  SERVICE & PRICE Service is catered more towards university students, it seems.  The staff was very casual, conversational, and kept things light hearted.  If you're looking for a fast-paced experience then please skip these types of establishments.  These modern \"hipster\" locations are meant for the experience more than the food.  The pricing is fair.  Base rate is $9.99 for a sushirrito and climbs with the more premium options.  The food is not glutinous and will not fill you up like the Bellagio Buffet or Lux Cafe at Venetian, so expect moderate to small portions.  Still, for the quality and experience, it can be worth it.  GOOD FOOD What surprised me was the fresh quality of the food.  One would think that since it is a pick your item bar like Subway, the options would get stale, hard, dry, etc.  nope.  It has to be a preservative of some sort (perhaps diluted vinegar) that keeps items very fresh.  Unless of course, they rotate the options with fresh batches all the time which could be a possibility being right next to a university... but I digress.  The seafood selections were of good texture, quality, and taste as well.  Me being picky, I wish any tempura-based items like the tempura shrimp, was deep fried fresh.  Here it was cold, and placed in a toaster oven for a minute.  It still did the trick and did what it was supposed to do, so I can't be upset at all.  OVERALL You do get what you pay for, with a hipster hospitality in mind.  Be careful of the time you go, but don't be put off by what it is or how much it is.  Next time I want to try a poke bowl item and update this review when it happens."}
{"text":"Cute Asian girl thanks for making our 4 shrimp lovers burrito 2 with tuna and u suggested I should put eel sauce on one and it taste so amazing great customer service here always on point my fave spot see u next time thanks girl!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a good reputation for a reason. The customer service is second to none... as is their patience! Plenty of parking in a large shopping area, too.  1. Pick a bowl or a burrito. 2. Pick your toppings OR a pre-made combo (It can get complicated here since you can customize any of the pre-made ones, too.)  If the price tag looks steep at $10 for a small, it's definitely a LOT of food once you pile on as many toppings as you want. Even with a big appetite that day, I couldn't finish my bowl at all and gave up.   Avoid ice cream mochi here. It's commercially bought and completely unpalatable. The green tea tastes like you're eating perfume.  While fish is okay in quality and doesn't compare with the poke giants of LV, the convenience, overall product, and customer service make it a great stop that I'd be happy to come back to."}
{"text":"Had to try the new poké spot in town. Ever since I had Sweetfin Poké in Santa Monica, CA...I was ompletely and utterly obsessed. And I have yet to find a spot that compares to Sweetfin Poké. Until now. The quality, flavors and texture were on point.   I had the Dragon bowl (unagi, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, crab with eel sauce and chipotle mayo $9.50). It was a fair portion for the price. So much food. The flavors blended together well and one of the things I love about Sweetfin Poké is they do great things with the toppings and texture. Sweet Poké did a great job all of the above. My husband had the Citrus Salmon (salmon, red onion, spicy tuna, masago, cilantro, wasabi yuzu with mango salsa $9.50). That was quite tasty as well.  I was so pleased and so excited about this poké spot that I immediately sent my poké fans a photo of my food and recommendation. Now they can't wait to try Sweet Poké too!"}
{"text":"This is a new place that opened within the last couple of months and the first time we went in my husband didn't think he'd like it so we left.  After reading several wonderful Yelp reviews I convinced him to try it and boy was it wonderful.  This time we stuck with the items on the menu rather than creating our own but we will definitely do that on our next trip.  The employees are very friendly, helpful and accommodating.  I ordered the Shrimp lover burrito but wanted to change the sauce and when I asked about some of the options they gave me a taste of each.  My husband ordered the Samba burrito.  What I like is that you can add most of the extras at no additional cost.  My husband and I shared with each other and we both decided that the Shrimp lover burrito was the better of the two. The best part of this is that this place is very close to where I live and  I can't wait to go back there and make my own bowl.  This is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced but their staff is so pleasant, it makes it worth spending a few extra dollars!"}
{"text":"My friend and i had Catalina bowl. Yellowtail was so fresh and loved deepfried asparagus with wasabi sauce. I've been other restaurant with similar concept by far this place the best so far.  Kind staffs and cleaness... I love it!!! Cant wait to try other items!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi burrito! Generous amount of quality fish with a variety of topping to choose from.  I had the combo which came with miso soup and a drink.  Well worth the $12 or so, the burrito was huge and I only ate half!"}
{"text":"I LOVE POKE!!! Ive tried a lot of poke places everywhere such as in California and even in Hawaii! This place is probably my least favorite! I ordered a reg. bowl and they are way too stingy on everything. Some of the fish doesnt even look fresh. Some of the staff doesnt look happy. I dont know its just not a good experienced for me. Id rather go to pokeman even tho its a far drive from my house or poke express!!"}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time and this reminds me of Chipotle or Quidoba Asian/sushi style.  lol. Reasonably priced for what you're getting.  You pick your proteins, and pretty much build your own bowl and sushi burrito. The toppings was a total delight. It was hard to make a choice because they give you so many options at no extra charge. Loving it! You get to choose several  sauces which is a plus. Fresh and defined flavors. They have several locations. I went to the Eastern Ave  location in Henderson, the staff were friendly, efficient, and when I couldn't make up my mind what to put on my sushi bowl the server at the counter patiently waited. I didn't feel rushed.  What I had was yummy! I had brown rice, salmon, tuna, crab, with sesame sauce, avocado, seaweed, etc. God knows what else I picked  but it was delish!!! My meal was less than 10.00 I've ordered from JA Burrito  and I paid almost 13.00 for a sushi bowl that barely had fish in it! Awful!  I love Sweet Poke! Check it out! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my third time going and it was amazing. I've had the samba, dragon, and the shrimp lover burritos. They are all amazing but samba has to be my favorite. I have not dined in but it does seem very clean which is always a plus. My first encounter with an employee was not very friendly you could definitely tell she did not want to be there but since then there customer service has improved. Tonight My boyfriend and I came 15 minutes before closing which can be annoying but Josh and the young girl (I have no idea how to spell her name sorry) made sure we were 100% happy with our order and didn't make us feel rushed. This place is my newest addiction"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Food ok. I got raw salmon, soft shell crab and spicy crab as the add on. The crab was great, the salmon was ok, the spicy crab ok. Could have been not knowing the sauces to pair them with.  Not sure where to go with this one. I did eat all of it because I was really hungry. Did I enjoy it and will I be back? No. Should have gone for tapas lol.  I guess if you haven't been introduced to the location in CA that requires no though of putting together an abundance of food and sauces (it is a plate you order) that has an outstanding mind blowing mix. Then you are missing out trying to put these sauces, fish and base together. It just isn't working for me.  They did have many cuatomers come through the door while I was there."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  We don't have fresh made poke in Minnesota, so finding this place was great!  I love how you get to customize your own dish with as many toppings and add ons as you like.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Disappointed....was so looking forward to eating here and the food was disappointing!!  Soft shell crab was dry and tasted like it was cooked earlier in the day and sat all day (my daughter ordered the Spider)   The sauce on my \"Diego\" burrito was heavy on the lemon flavor and it was so overpowering, spicy ahi tasted\"off\"...3 bites and I wrapped it up and tossed it....I wanted to like it but I just can't  it was really disappointing."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals/best experiences I've had in a while. The guy who took my order was SO friendly but not in an annoying or intrusive way. It was very refreshing. They also have this legit deal called the Rebel combo where you can get a small bowl of ramen AND a burrito or bowl for 13 bucks. That's such a good deal! I ate the ramen and half of my burrito and saved the rest for later. Both items were absolutely delicious. It's hard to find good service now a days, especially in a fast casual setting. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Since sushi burritos have been a huge hit in Vegas lately, with several different franchise stores popping up across the city, there is room for a lot of competition. So, let's talk poké.   Cleanliness: 5/5 While I was eating a worker came out to do a sweep of the shop and clean tables and such. Wiping on point.   Parking: Easy to find next to the Cafe Rio and right next to the new parking garage that opened up for UNLV. Lots of parking inside the plaza, so no worries there. Walking takes five minutes from the SU.   Customer Service: 5/5 The workers were patient and cordial and said a loud farewell as we were leaving. Much appreciated to see the effort.   Food: 5/5 I got the Hamachi San Bowl in regular size. It was pretty big and perfect in serving size for me. I also got edamame and furikake as additions to the bowl. There are a lot of options to choose from when deciding what to add for your bowl. The fish tasted fresh, as did the ingredients. A bit pricey, but fish are usually expensive anyway.   Overall: I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Their poke bowls are to die for! Price point is fair, 8.99 for a reg bowl and $11.50 for a large. The crew are very nice, I've been here 5 times since they opened and they have been pretty consistent with the customer service. I personally like them better than the other sushi/poke burrito place I've been to because their flavors/sauces taste better.  The only thing I don't like is that they are close to my house and will most likely put a hole in my pocket lol. I'd recommend this place to any poke/sushi lovers that are on a budget"}
{"text":"Amazing! Definitely worth all the stars! I did the \"create your own\" poke bowl. Fresh selection of fish, great sauces, excellent customer service. I will definitely be returning! I even got a free bag of taro chips since it was their first week being open."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Poke place on this side of town and thought I would try this place. I never have time to write reviews but I thought I needed to this time.  I ordered the regular size poke bowl.  The staff didn't seem to care about what they were making. The fish was good, but the rice was so hard it stuck in my teeth. I asked for my sauce on the side -soy sauce. She said that I could get it at the register. I asked the guy at the register and was given 2 packets. I asked for a few more and he got annoyed and actually asked me, \"You need more?\" Then he gave me 2 more like I had just robbed him. So, I had to eat this big bowl of dry rice and fish with nothing but 4 little packs of soy sauce.  The rice was so hard that I ended up throwing away what was left after eating the fish, since you know, I had nothing left to put on it.... and since I had worn out my welcome after requesting more than 2 packages of soy sauce, I wasn't about to ask for more.  The fish was good, I'm sure if you go, the rice will be fully cooked. If it is, you will probably enjoy your meal. But, if you want soy sauce on the side, good luck with that.  Everything combined made for an overall blah experience, but when you can't even cook the rice...  I gave them a shot, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was driving by on rainbow saw this new place just opened so I decided to give it a try and i was surprised how delicious the food was and how fast they prepared.  I recommend if you are  looking for a nice poke, fast fresh and so delicious."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at this place coming at least once a week. Used to be a bowl of food for either $10 or $12, now for two of us there's no way to get a full bowl of food, it's barely half full and it's still $38 each time. You have to look like an idiot for and ask them to properly measure so you get what you paid for. People there don't give two craps about anything. Even asked the manager/owner to contact me. Nothing so far. Go to all you can eat sushi place for same price and be happy. You lost 4 regular customers  -correction: owner did call me. His response was \"our scoops didn't change and you got what you paid for\".  Lovely"}
{"text":"Tasted great was supper fresh and delicious. Also great service very friendly, but the potion size was the only thing I did not like it wasn't enough food for the price, but over all I would say defiantly good for everyone in a while, best sushi burrito I ever had..."}
{"text":"Great spot just think they may have a sewage problem because it smells, & just need there employees to memorize what goes inside the order instead of always having to try and read the menu. Could work on putting equal amounts of everything too. The guy doing my order put about a teaspoon of seaweed salad but the girl who did my husbands put a good amount of seaweed in his, so consistency would be nice. Other then that I recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Poke wasn't bad.  Spicy wasn't  Over sauced  Over all not bad Poke....  Seems like a trendy spot so best in the area for what they serve..."}
{"text":"Wow. Fresh!! HUGE! Seaweed on point- perfect flavor every bite. My partner and I split a burrito and both left full. The fish was AMAZING and the sweet girl at the counter did a great job walking us through the options as first timers. $10 for the burrito but well worth it- two protein options and we added spicy tuna at the end at well. It's freaking delicious!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good til I hurt my tooth biting into a bone that they left in the salmon!! I'm pissed"}
{"text":"First time at a place like this friendly service, I had the Dragon Roll and it was excellent"}
{"text":"We came in for a late lunch and despite the late lunch hour there was still a few folks in front of us - I took that as a good sign.  The staff was very good and super friendly.  We had three orders which were handled by 3 different employees.      I selected the Ahi Lover with brown rice.  I got a large which comes with 3 scoops of Ahi.  I added several items from the free section to make my bowl even better.  They had a new sauce for the Ahi Lover Bowl which was really good.  I truly enjoyed the bowl.  The Ahi was fresh tasting and gaily plentiful.      I am stunned at all the Poke/Sushi Burrito places near me house.  There is 4 within 2 miles.  Hopefully they all continue to do well as I truly enjoy Poke and Sushi Burritos.  Sweet Poke is a welcome addition to the SW.  I have one more to try before deciding which one is the standout."}
{"text":"This place was great at first . The place really went down hill so quick I feel like the fish was not fresh , I honestly couldn't finish it I felt weird all day never again I'll go to this place . I hate when I try to give small business clients then it's great at first but then after it goes down . I hate going to big corporations but sometimes it's better cause it's save ."}
{"text":"This place is the best Sushi bowl place me and my wife have been to. The food was great but even more than that, the reason I'd come back is for the staff. The staff were first class. Corina and Baylee. They need a raise!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised! Boyd your own bowl or burrito or even a salad. For the price you got a lot of protein. Many options and if you didn't know what something was they would let you sample it. Staff was friendly and place was clean. Food was great and the kids enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 808 based upon the recommendation of the person who was helping me. While the toppings are plentiful, the spicy tuna was bland and the tuna was okay quality. Garlic chips were delicious and I wished I asked for extra! They were generous with the base of salad. I probably won't come back if i were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi burrito places in Vegas. And I've gotta say this place doesn't hit the mark.  The rice was under cooked and didn't seem to be seasoned at all. Can't call it sushi if the rice isn't seasoned, the burrito was also rolled very sloppy. They have the necessary items to make a clean and consistent roll (bamboo) but don't bother to use them. I was a sushi chef so I am pretty knowledgeable on how rice should taste, the texture it should have, and how to roll it all up.  For the same price as their \"regular\" size buritto I have got what I think they consider large at other establishments.    Came in with high hopes. But was not wowed, so unfortunately I will not be frequenting this place.  Nice try guys, but you need some better quaintly control"}
{"text":"Yummm first time here. Very clean and friendly staff. Ahi is fresh and delicious. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My fav place to get a sushirito! Clean place, very very nice staff! Love the shrimp lover roll and Taro chips, just wish they gave you more chips lol, that's my only complaint!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this poke place and have been four times in two weeks.  The fish is incredibly fresh and they have so many sauces and options for toppings.  I was surprised at how great the portion sizes are, and they even give you spicy tuna as a topping.  They have so much variety I can put together a new flavor every time.  This is my favorite place now and have been eating it more than regular sushi.  On top of how delicious the food is, the staff is super friendly and accommodating.  I am excited they will open more locations soon!"}
{"text":"While some places offer either sushi burritos or poke bowls, Sweet Poke offers both.  Recently, they added ramen to their menu.  First visit I had the Diego bowl with spring mix greens + ramen combo.  The Diego bowl is basically hamachi + spicy tuna.  The sauce on the hamachi is a sweet shoyu sauce with masago and green onions to complete the poke.  A scoop of spicy tuna and we were off to the toppings.  I chose wakame (seaweed) salad, red onions, and fried sliced garlic.  Those garlic chips are so delicious!!  A small ramen was included in the combo.  Although I wasn't blown away by the ramen, I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This combo is perfect for those of you who are on the hungrier side.  Second visit I went with a large Hamachi San bowl.  Similar to the Diego, this is a bowl with hamachi and spicy tuna.  Since I was pretty hungry, I opted for brown rice over spring mix greens this time.  To my Hamachi San, I added wakame salad, chili strips, red onion, garlic chips, jalapenos, and fried onions.  I was very satisfied after eating this.  There was a lot of fish to last the entire meal.  Sometimes you have leftover rice and no fish to eat it with, but not here.  Fish to the very end!!    Sweet Poke is definitely on my personal wheel of lunch.  Go out and give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as the photos and the description of the bowls are concerned, there is plenty share here already which is an excellent example of Sweet Poke and their excellent product.  I am used to eating poke just plain, like I get at Poke Express but the addition of all of the other goodies is a nice variation.  Since Poke Express is up north from me this addition to our neighborhood is truly welcomed.  I pop in about twice a week and am still in experimental stages trying different things.  Love the tuna and salmon with the wasabi aioli but there is so much more to try.  I recommend trying the California style poke experience.  Plus it is healthy!"}
{"text":"Good food, pretty good price. It's a good slightly cheaper alternative to traditional sushi"}
{"text":"Since I have tried other sushi burrito spots... I was so excited to see this one opening up near our house. We tried this place out twice and I am not pleased with the quality of their food. Once you walk in there's this \"fishy\" smell... Which pretty much indicates that the fish isn't all that fresh. You can tell that the workers aren't trained well... Because when I unwrapped the paper around my burrito it completely fell apart. Pretty much I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been a little hesitant to try a poké joint since moving to Vegas since we had a bad experience with some sashimi we bought from a local supermarket but I'm glad we decided to try this place out. The fish is really fresh and tasty! We chose the \"make your own bowl\" option with yellowtail tuna, white rice, furukake, garlic ponzu sauce, avocado, tempura flakes, edamame, and some dried seaweed on top. It was absolutely amazing. Reminded me of my days in Hawaii where I took for granted how great the poke is. I've run into some lousy fish since I've been in Vegas but this place does not mess with the old stuff. Not only is their fish nice and fresh, their veggies and other toppings are as well.   Be sure to try their garlic ponzu sauce! It goes so well with the yellowtail tuna. We're already looking forward to coming back to try another combo."}
{"text":"Pretty decent poke bowls. Restaurant is very clean and help is nice. Would recommend it to anyone that enjoys sushi burritos or bowls."}
{"text":"James at Sweet Poke has the most outstanding customer service!!! We stopped in and had such a pleasant experience. I would honestly drive across town just to go to go to this location 100% because we were treated so well. Thanks James for treating us so well!!!"}
{"text":"Turns out to be my meal stop when I'm up in No. LV.  Improved in customer service. Quick and prompt. Increase in prices too!  But all good.  I loved my BYO Sushi Burrito.  Increase to a whole 4**** rating - may as well.  My BYO Seaweed burrito Protein: Tuna, Salmon, Masago Sauces: Chipotle mayo & Spicy garlic ponzu Toppings: Spicy tuna, Seaweed salad, Avocado, Cucumber, Red onion, Cilantro  More drink selections!  They have the melon and mango cream soda :)  I like the mango better.  Thank you for making my order right.  Ness enjoyed her bowl; her first visit.    New perk: text a code to get points for a free poke bowl or sushi burrito!  Get it poke fiends!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and healthy, tasty options! They even have a drive thru if you're lazy and don't  want to get out of the car like myself :p I got the \"808\" bowl which includes tuna, spicy tuna, tamago, lettuce, masago, chili flakes, green onion, and sweet onion in a sesame shoyu sauce, on top of a bed of warm white rice. The tuna was really fresh and had no fishy taste/smell at all! The marinade was perfect, flavorful with a hint of sweetness.   I will definitely be back to get my hands on one of their sushi burritos."}
{"text":"I've seen this restaurant a few times as we passed that way.  Well we were hungry and decided to stop.  I got the salmon bowl with the sides.  I enjoyed all the choices with sides and thought the food was clean and good.  I will return"}
{"text":"It was hard getting here by driving because there was not a really close intersection to u turn. I had to turn in some side streets but it was worth the poke craving I had. Service was fast and I got to choose what they have instead of premixed bowls. I got the ahi tuna and salmon with yum yum sauce with sarachi mayo on top bowl. It's devouring. I wish the tuna was cut smaller but other than that, is come again."}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab a quick bite. Always good and delicious. Service is fantastic even when it's slightly busy. There is a slight wait ,but worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favourites!!! It's clean, neat and everything looks fresh.  The staff is very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week for about a year, and as of late I've been rather disappointed, it's never the service, sometimes I feel a little rushed, but other than that, they're usually very nice and quick, I'm just not sure what's up with the quality of the food, my visit today really bothered me and I just wanted to let it be heard.. it's seems like the salmon isn't fresh anymore and the rice is always hard, my seaweed salad tasted stale and I threw half of it away, I'd take a bite and chew a little bit and spit it out. I honestly just got my own burrito, salmon, seaweed salad, cucumbers & avocado.. I don't blame the workers, I get it.. stuff happens, but after today I think I'll just stick with driving 25 minutes to Tail & Fin."}
{"text":"Yeah,  I'm going to have to pass on this one. I really wanted to like this place, as it's the closest to my home, but of the 3x's I've been here, I was disappointed each time.   The kids who work here, don't really know what they're doing. You definitely can't hear them on the other side of the glass. The customer ahead of me and I looked at each other twice wondering what the heck was going on because we both had to repeat ourselves a few times. I realized the easiest way to get what you want, is to just 'point'.    The guy who took care of me definitely did not seem like he knew much, didn't engage much in conversation ( it wasn't busy, just me and the customer in front of me, whom the female employee helped). When he rung me out, he didn't say, 'Thank you.' Customer service is VERY important to me so I really took note in remembering this experience. As I left the restaurant, I always say a, 'Thank you' before I walk out the door....only the female acknowledged and said, 'Have a nice day.'  For the price I paid for a regular bowl, I think they should put more fish in it. A half cup of poke in a big bed of rice isn't worth it....rice is CHEAP! Not to mention that the poke didn't seem very fresh. There's a ton of poke bowl restaurants up and down Rainbow Blvd and I know competition is pretty steep. For a place that's literally at the end of Rainbow Blvd, where most people don't go to unless they live near, I think they should step up.   As for now, I will continue to drive up the street and go to the other poke place where one would get your money's worth....and they have better customer service."}
{"text":"Great place to get fresh food on the go or dine in. My wife took me here for the first time and I loved it, I never had a sushi roll the big and shape like a burrito. I really like the fact that you can make it just the way you want it and fresh. I will be coming back soon and this is my new hot spot."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I only get cooked shrimp, they were all out and tried to give a \"veggie bowl\" which is the same price.  But didn't tell me until it was too late. Terrible service"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Loosely rolled burritos. Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Unique and fun Japanese food.  Loved it !!  Reminds me of a sushi subway.  Friendly fast service."}
{"text":"Love this place . Been to a few of the pike places and this one is by far the best . On pricey side but well worth it"}
{"text":"Had the 808 bowl, it was great. The girl making it was very helpful and nice. She explained what was in the bowl. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Sweet Poké for a while and today was the day: I dropped my car off for a detail up the street and I was hungry so I walked down to check it out. It's super clean and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. I did a build your own bowl with white rice, salmon, eel & yum yum sauces, crab, avocado, and cream cheese. They've got tons of choices for toppings, but I decided to keep it pretty simple for my first time. The service was good and it is delicious! Cream cheese is $1 extra, but he gave me a pretty good portion so I didn't mind at all. The regular bowl with two scoops of protein was definitely a good portion of food. They aren't stingy with the ingredients, that's for sure! I'll definitely come back and bring the family with next time!"}
{"text":"So so so so soooooo yummy!!! Can't wait to eat a thousand more times :) And luck me it's walking distance from my house"}
{"text":"I am in this place weekly. If one day, I can't pay my mortgage, it will probably be Sweet Poke's fault! I usually build my own bowl or sushi burrito. I often use their app to order ahead of time, so it's very convenient. It usually tells me my bowl will be ready 25-30 minutes after I order it, which is much further out than I would expect it to take. Typically, I show up in about 15 minutes and it is already ready...or they get on it and get it to me within minutes. And on two occasions, they have made the bowl incorrectly on the first try, so they make it again and give me both bowls anyways! (It's a nice bonus considering the bowls weren't made significantly incorrectly the first time.)   Yum. Just writing this review has given me a craving for it."}
{"text":"Sweet poke is one of the top 3 poke bowl/sushi burrito places in town in my opinion. All the fish taste fresh and portion is very generous. I love that they don't charge extra for toppings like masago, avocado, edamame, and seaweed like other poke places. My favorite sauce here is the wasabi yuzu. Pricing is comparable to other poke places. $9.50 for regular size and $11.99 for large size bowl. Trust me; always go large! Burrito is $9.50. The place is kept clean. Plenty of seatings. Friendly servers. It's in the same strip mall as cafe summer and creamberry. Easy access off of rainbow and plenty of parking spaces."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick and tasty sushi roll or poke bowl this is the place to go! Very friendly and great environment.  Make your own or select from classic options. Only down side - there isn't a Henderson location."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! This place has the best fish selection by far! There's octopus, eel, softshell crab, and your typical salmon, tuna, yellowtail and crab. The toppings are amazing too. Most places charge for avocado, but it's a free topping here. Yippee.   I got the bowl option and anxious to try the burrito. Every poke place is just a bit different in their offerings, how many proteins your selected bowl size allows, size, extras. But Sweet poke has it all, the best selection and the best value for included items without the upcharge. They sent me home with a free side to boot. I chose edamame."}
{"text":"I'm hooked. This is my 3rd Sweet Poké store that I've been to in Las Vegas. I'm a fan, a stalker, whatever. It's as good as the others and right in front of the 24hour fitness so I like to grab a healthy bite after an intense cardio class. Try to get John because he gives the most generous scoops of fish and fixings. Sorry John, hope I didn't sell you out."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Sweet Poke on the east side. I got a burrito this time. Really great selection of fish proteins. They offer Eel and scallops here. No extra charge for massage or seaweed. I like that they offer Japanese drinks like Calpico, Ramune, Ito En teas and brands I can't read as they are in Japanese. New southwest location helps you avoid crowds."}
{"text":"I was there today, Sunday, February 12, 2017, around 1:45 p.m. and when I first entered I was the only customer. There was a guy and girl who initially assisted me. The female employee's customer service was very good, she even gave me her recommendations when I wasn't sure what to order, as it was my first time there.   After I paid for my food I decided to use their restroom. As the saying goes, how a company keeps its restrooms clean, usually determines (or not) how they maintain the cleanliness of their kitchen. Please see the attached pictures as they speak for themselves! Just heinous!! First of all, the lighting in the reatroom was so dim you could barely see, should have been a warning. If there is another similar establishments like this restaurant I would rather go somewhere else.  I gave it two stars because the food was decent."}
{"text":"YUM!  Not much more I can say except maybe FREAKING YUM!  The bowl was amazing (salmon half kale/spinach with seaweed salad green onions cucumber and edamame with their spicy soy sauce) AND the ahi burrito with all of the deliciousness rolled up in a nice, tight soy wrap.  The crew at the Centennial loc are helpful, patient ... just GREAT customer service!  Eat there or go home.  Soooo goood!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place and super excited this location is thriving.  Expect to wait in line especially on weekends and during lunch rush.  Good selection of proteins and toppings to create your sushi burrito or bowl."}
{"text":"I like the variety in sauces at this place and the fact that it is close to home. Comparing the quality of fish to Poke Express I would have to say it's not that great. The salmon is comparable to other places but the tuna at this place I can not eat... and I love tuna. I do enjoy their spicy crab and yum yum sauce on my rice, but the quality of fish is way better at Poke express."}
{"text":"Out of ALL the food places in Vegas this ranks toward the top of my list. Only reason it didn't get all 5 stars is the inside while very clean isn't very comfy and it was a little hard to understand/hear the guy making my bowl and he was a little impatient with me as new person ordering."}
{"text":"Not so sweet- I was so excited when I saw this place open near me. Long story short, rice was undercooked, the tuna was chewy, and the staff has no idea what they are doing. Whole foods sells spicy tuna rice bowls that taste better. Taste was just meh."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi burrito!! I got the samba and it did not disappoint! Choose between a bowl or roll! Very clean and great price!!"}
{"text":"I got the Dragon burrito and my man got the 808 bowl. I thought my burrito was very tasty - not as good as Soho Sushi Burrito plus Soho has more options. My man didn't really like his bowl...I tasted the poke in it and I've definitely tasted better poke elsewhere (like at Island Sushi). Great service and very clean inside."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to open in Centennial Hills, and Sweet Poke did not disappoint! The food is delicious and very fresh, the staff is super knowledgable and friendly, and the restaurant itself is very clean and well-decorated. This will be a new regular for lunch!"}
{"text":"Always on point and the staff in Henderson are super nice!!! Wish I can order beforehand for the chicken but I understand that they can't make it and not have the customer show up."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, fast paced , pleasant employees --- don't be shy to ask and try the sauces  So many to choose from.  Can't go wrong.  My favorite-- Spicy ginger shoyu -- perfect sweet,spicy, tangy combo. Will definitely be returning. Tummy and tastebuds satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the Shaka surf bowl. Many options to chose from. The prices are reasonable and staff is so helpful. My family and I come here to eat at least once a week."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with how great the food is. Instead, I'm recognizing the great service provided by the team that works at this joint. My wife and I stopped by last week, and knew something was up when a female consumer started ordering additional portions, basically taking advantage of the menu and its employees. She was rude, condescending, and feigned ignorance when an employee reminded her she had previously been discouraged from such behaviors.  If you want specificity in the food you eat, make it yourself. Otherwise, respect those working, and the 5 people waiting behind you. At the very least, recognize you're unhappy and find a healthy outlet to channel your sense of frustration or need for control. Don't take it out on some teenagers who don't get paid nearly enough to deal with your attitude."}
{"text":"I got the dragon bowl. It was pretty tasty! Would recommend to anyone in the area, the staff is also really friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Poke Bowl ever! Their portions are huge compared to all others that I tried and I tried a lot. Servers are friendly and very accommodating. This is a bit way off from my home in LV but I still go to this place at least  once a week. Since the portions are huge, I eat it for lunch and still have plenty left over for dinner."}
{"text":"First experience here and I was thoroughly impressed. The vast amount of choices on the menu are sure to accommodate for any person's preferences. My large poke bowl was packed with ingredients that complimented eachother so well. I personally enjoyed the mango salsa, as well as no extra charge for my avocado. The best part was the help from the staff. I was lost walking in, but Alex took me step by step and gave me thoughtful and non-robotic suggestions that truly made the process an easy one. Great service. The only complaint is the lack of ambiance. The menu can appeal to a younger crowd yet the inside decor lacks personality, this could be the factor separating it from be a regular hangout spot. It is a small downside to a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pokè stop in town! I came in for the first time with my friends & all of the employees were super nice & attentive. I was helped by Grace & she made some great recommendations. I had a shrimp lover burrito on the soy paper. I also added eel sauce and tempera crunch. It was super fresh and delicious!! The menu can be a little confusing at first, but all the employees on the night shift did a really good job at explaining things & answering my questions.   Overall, I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to highlight the wonderful customer service at this location! The team is wonderful, especially Danielle. She remembers customers and is always super pleasant and helpful when we show up for our weekly dinner! Thanks Danielle for always making our experience a positive one.  This place is a must try! The food is fresh and the customer service is wonderful. Lots of options to choose from (protein, veggies, etc). I enjoy the flexibility of being able to build my own meal specific to my taste. I've been here 3 times in one week and each time the food has been delicious. This is just what this area needed and it looks like it will be around for a while."}
{"text":"Sushi on the fly and great service. This location has always been solid for my lunch breaks and the 2 young ladies who create my poke bowl or sushi burrito are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the ideal of the sushi bowls! Sushi burritos are the best! The bowls are amazing to the point where you can put as much as you want for no additional charge! The workers are always so patient, friendly, & helpful! I would most definitely recommend this place and I'll be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Hawaiian food but this is an awesome food experience. would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"It is one of the best poke bowl place I've been to here in Vegas ! Just order with the girls or manager and you're all set! The portions are great they put a really good amount of the topping! And one of the toppings is spicy tuna so what's not to like about this place!!"}
{"text":"Fresh! Sweet poke is fresh and fast! If you like sushi bowls and sushi burritos then this place is perfect for you! We like the salmon Shaka and the Shaka surf. This place is new and clean and has a great vibe. Plenty of parking out front and friendly staff. Happy to have a great sushi burrito place so close to our home in mountains edge."}
{"text":"I've been to a different location in the past, and decided to try this one out since it was a little closer. Though I've only been to two Sweet Poke locations, I've found that the food is consistently good and of high quality.  The only disappointing part of coming here yesterday was that they didn't have avocados/all their avocados were bad. That's pretty crazy, seeing as the majority of their items include avocado as the featured ingredient.   I wish they had mentioned that to us before we ordered, we found out after they were already halfway building my husband's dragon sushi burrito. They at least let him change his order, and he ordered a bowl instead.  I ordered the Vegas Sushi burrito, which usually contains avocado, but was still pretty good without it.   I definitely want to return, but hopefully they will have avocado next time."}
{"text":"Fast and easy service. Everything is done in front of you. I am still waiting for poke poku to open on this side of town because I love their soft shell crab option way more. They have it here but they soft shell crab is whole pieces. My bowl was good over all."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and tasty! The staff are friendly and helpful. I definitely plan to be a regular at this location."}
{"text":"This is the second location of the poke chain. Located across the street for Gelatology and in the same plaza as Creamberry and Coco donuts, it follows the same format as most other local poke/sushi burrito places. They have some house specials or you can build your own. I opted for a regular sized build your own.  I like that a scoop of spicy tuna is automatically included, something I haven't seen at other places. The quality of the fish seemed pretty good, the sauces were plentiful and they were generous with them, the rice was a touch too warm for my liking (for poke bowls) but still good. Standard toppings as other spots. But overall, the quality seemed a little higher and the end result was a tastier product."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to go to a Awesome Poke  spot and came across SWEET POKE! Mikela was the employee that helped us!! She is AWESOME!!! She was very friendly, efficient, and personable! It was our first time there, so she was there every step of the way. It's a really nice spot for a customized Poke Bowls!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi burrito / bowl spot in the city!  Get the yum yum sauce the next time your in."}
{"text":"overall pretty good. It's great to choose tofu as a base instead of rice or salad. The anticucho shoyu sauce is good if you like spicy"}
{"text":"I decided to order 3 bowls to go for dinner for my family tonight and this place is definitely better than Soulfish but not as good as Pokeman.  I got the Diego (yellowtail), Aloha (ahi tuna) and Salmon Shaka.  The Diego was mine.  The yellowtail pieces were small and not as buttery as the pieces I had at Pokeman.  Also, they don't offer sushi rice here.  Options are white or brown.  My hubby enjoyed his Salmon Shaka though.  The staff that helped me was very friendly.  Overall, this place is A-Ok."}
{"text":"I dont like being rushed and spoke to like im inconvenient. I dont like my food passed around to other people to finish. I tried another Poke spot yesterday on Eastern and Horizon Ridge. The staff was very nice and attentive to how I wanted my burito. They had better fish as well. Sweet poke was busiest of the two. I had to sit at a table with fish smeared on it.  This place is ok. Id come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Simply stated, this place is like a Chipotle for sushi. I've gone back many, many times! There are loads of options for all tastes. I'm not big into raw sushi, so I usually end up getting a sushi burrito with shrimp tempura and imitation crab, but I have ventured out and tried just about everything they have to offer, and I'm never disappointed. You get the choice of whatever you want to put in your burrito, but they also have some combinations/suggestions on the menu if you're not too sure what might work well together. They also have bowls and other little snacks like mochi balls. Pricing is appropriate, I usually spend about $12-14 on myself when I go, but I always grab a drink and extra toppings. Staff is very accommodating and patient with any questions. It's a cute little place, great for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Sweet Poke is excellent! I'm not a big seafood person but I've heard so many good things about sushi burritos and sushi bowls that I thought I'd give it a shot and I wasn't disappointed. The fish is fresh, the sauces are great and the staff is friendly and very patient. Not being too familiar with this kind of stuff, the staff let me try different sauces so I could build my own bowl! It was extremely helpful and delicious :) definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Fresh fish and friendly staff! I love how you are able to build your own bowl and burrito. It's definitely a new twist on sushi! I recommend this place to everyone if you want to venture out and try something different!! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I had this place in Centennial location bookmarked for a couple of weeks so when I found out they opened this second store closer to me, I was so exited.  OMG, I had a bad experience here.  First, I was waiting in a line to order my food and this lady that came after me cut in the line. Well, this happens a lot to me for some reason (If you are from Japan, you may know this, too), but usually employees say something to the person and they realize I was there before. This store, I know this guy working here saw the lady squeezed right in front of me but he didn't say anything. Nothing, instead he started taking this lady's order. Fine. I don't get crazy with this kind of small stuff.  Then, my turn came. I could tell this tall skinny kid that was taking my order was very nervous. I ordered regular bowl, half rice and half lettuce. He put just rice. No lettuce. I didn't say anything because maybe they put lettuce after or on top. He told me to pick two proteins. So I said salmon and shrimp. He put three tiny salmon cubes on top of the rice and he started to shredding one shrimp in three or four pieces with his shaky hands... WTH?! I had to say something but I didn't know what to say because maybe that's their way to do things here... So I said \"I wanted half rice and half lettuce on the bottom...\" The girl that was working noticed me saying that and saw what he was doing. She remade my bowl. She put six pieces of salmon and she didn't shred the shrimp by hands, thank God. 1 star for remaking my bowl but the guy that looked like the manager seemed annoyed. (I got super annoyed by him giving me a dirty look.) I am not blaming this kid because I have experienced the same when I was his age. (high school) This was probably his first or second day at this job and he was in training. I know it's nerve-racking very first day or second day at any kind of job. Someone or the manager should've watched him when he was making the bowl. Not his fault at all. Still, $8.99 for what I got is way too overpriced. (Sorry, I'm used to Poke Express's price) If it's in NYC or on the Vegas strip, I would say the price is reasonable but this is on Rainbow and Windmill... Really?! Why so skimpy on the shrimps also? I saw one guy complaining there was no shrimp in his 808 bowl.  Not coming back. I would not recommend this place. Go elsewhere to get your Poke.  (Oh, about the food. I forgot. Just like any other similar places like here. Fresh and delicious. +1 more star then. Okay.)"}
{"text":"We returned with a friend and the person in charge honored the owner's offer of a credit for the overcharge we had on our first visit.  We tried other combinations this time with delicious results. All 3 of us loved the fresh tastes and terrific service. Wonderful way to appease our hunger during these hot summer days!"}
{"text":"I had a really good first impression of this location. It's right across from UNLV and right next to the parking garage that I normally park in so how convenient is that!   Anyways the staff was friendly and helpful. I was a little indecisive with what I wanted on my bowl but the girl recommended to add tempura crunch. Great suggestion, I'll probably continue to add this to my bowls from now on. I got the salmon for my protein and it was very fresh and good quality. Be sure to show them your rebel card, UNLV students get 10%off!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever I have tried a poke. I really liked it. This place is nice, clean and spacious. Service was friendly, they helped me to make a choice. But I gave only 4 stars, because I ordered Salmon Shaka bowl and they didn't put me avocado in it. My friend ordered Dragon bowl and she also didn't have avocado in her bowl. I was really disappointed, because my order was \"to go\", so we noticed it only at home."}
{"text":"Love this place! There's no Poké spot in my immediate neighborhood so I drive 15 mins to this spot because it's worth it. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh, and prices are reasonable. I get the chipotle mayo & eel sauce for a sweet spicy mix."}
{"text":"I can see why people rave about this place, but I don't think I'll be returning. I am a poké FANATIC, I make my own, island style, at home when I feel up to it and it's probably because I am accustomed to how it should be that I don't like Sweet Poké.   After Trader Joe's moved I figured it would be a great time to try a new poke place. I love finding great new spots, but I came in with no hopes since I didn't look it up beforehand. I came in the afternoon around 2 pm on a Wednesday, looked around and loved the decor and the cool message from the owner. There were already people sitting down eating their lunches.  I then perused the menu, decided on an 808 Bowl, and relayed my order to a bored looking younger girl with brown/blond hair. I saw that it said you can get a half and half for the carb portion so I asked for taro chips but she told me it wasn't an option anymore. Ok cool, so I went with just the white rice. She asked if I wanted furikake, then proceeded to walk me through the line. After me were two girls completely new to the idea of poké. It was then that I realized what I didn't like about it: I did not like that they had turned the idea of poké to a Subway-sandwich style food line with a stop and explanation at each portion of the meal.  Because I either order it and accept what is given to me (like as in a restaurant), or get it by the pound pre-made with a number of options for styles, I dislike the breaking down and explanation of ingredients. It felt unauthentic and inefficient. The girl put a wopping dollop of sesame shoyu sauce on the tuna that disguised the taste of the tuna completely. I actually panicked and asked her what it was. She was not friendly whatsoever, just gave me a look that said \"It's the sesame shoyu sauce, DUH\". I did not expect so much sauce. There are many options to include in the order, and I generally go with whatever the set comes with so I got it with everything it came with. At the end, I paid and sat down to try my bowl.   It was good--not great--but with the three greens, and all the other things I think a bento style bowl would have made it better so I could compartmentalize my meal (rice and poké seperate from veggies) rather than go digging underneath and around for stuff. The vast options for customization is definitely more to other people's taste, but not mine. I loved that the veggies tasted fresh, the fish showed no signs of water damage, and it was a beautiful plate, but did not satisfy my poké needs. They also allow you to earn points towards a free meal with an app. Overall, a no go for me, but I wish them luck. I'll stick to Poké Express on Craig Rd."}
{"text":"I was driving by today and decided to stop in and give it a try. I thought the poke bowl I got was fantastic! It was my first time and the gentleman that helped me was super patient and informative. I thought the portions of the fish were pretty good and the quality was A+ . I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it was actually pretty good. Def worth my $9. I made my own bowl with white rice, salmon, tako, etc. They have different sauces that you should try. The one I chose was the sesame shoyu. Good portions, very clean restaurant. It's also one of the very few poke places that will allow you to get tofu as a base if you don't prefer rice or greens. Bowls came in two sizes which was a regular for $9.50 which gets 2 scoops and a large which is $11.99 and gets 3 scoops. I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone who likes to try new poke places."}
{"text":"I'm not from this side of town, but when I'm in the Centennial area I get my quick sushi fix from here.  The menu is good, lots of variety no matter if you choose a pre made item or build your own.  Each time I've been here the ingredients and fish are fresh!  My first time here it was very busy, but the people behind the counter were friendly and willing to help. Very good customer service :) I'll keep coming back for the good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been to Sweet Poké twice now and this is definitely my preferred place to purchase poke bowls. I typically order salad bowls for mine so I love that there are multiple options such as spinach, spring mix and kale. I will say the kale is quite disappointing, they're very large pieces that are dry (unlike massaged kale that's more tender). The fish quality is great, I love their salmon! AND they're not stingy with fish which is what makes me return each time. Aside from that they're very pleasant in the shop, I've never felt rushed ordering since I don't know their ordering process very well. I've personally ordered to go every time however I have noticed that there is not much space for dining in. I definitely recommend them for a healthy lunch or a healthy lite dinner but consider ordering to go!"}
{"text":"This was my third time here and it's true when they say 3 times a charm or 3 strikes and your out.  Well, for me, it was the first.  3rd time hit home run!  The Dragon roll is the best.  I have been to other sushi burritos in town, but this one seems to have the largest variety of fish. The unagi is excellent!  My family also enjoyed their burritos very much. I must say the staff is friendly and patient.  The manager is very personable.  I would recommend this place for 2 reasons, great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poké place out of the places I've tried!! I like how the toppings (spicy crab, crab, and spicy tuna) are separate from the actual proteins and you get one for free! I really like the yum yum sauce - some places don't have yum yum sauce and the most important thing are the sauces. Everyone is really nice too :-)"}
{"text":"First time at Sweet Poke and I must say it was great. The gentlemen behind the counter walked me and my mom through the menu  and told us how to order. The place is super clean and the food was fantastic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So so Good...Love Poke Bowls and it's so close to my house. I could eat here everyday.....yummy!"}
{"text":"This Poké bowl and burrito place on rainbow in front of Smith's has really good food and always looks so fresh. I go in probably twice or even three times a week!! I usually get a bowl and my favorite is actually the 808 in a bowl. I also love to add a bunch of their additional free toppings which are always great. I usually put seaweed salad, edamame, fried onion, tempura crunch, and some pineapple and mango and topped with the dry nori they have.  Plus I as well grab some taro chips and it comes with the creamy jalapeño sauce which taste so bomb. This place is great, if your in a pinch for time and need something to eat. The workers here are all so welcoming and send a good happy vibe out which always brightens my day. I have met so many of the different employees that remember me when I come in which is wonderful that they take their time to recognize frequent customers. Love when they say \" Oh it's nice to see you again!\"  Oh and not to mention the manager is great as well when I do see him there he's always smiling and so happy.  I recommend people to come try this place out highly highly recommend. Fresh food made right in front of you daily."}
{"text":"Extremely fresh stuff this place! It's really new but I highly recommend it to anyone who loves poke! The price is mediocre but reasonable and the staff is extremely helpful!!!   In all honesty, didn't expect some of the freshest seafood to be in a poke shop, but they proved me wrong. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Sweet Poke to us. He said it would change our lives. Wow he was right. Since we have never been here, the people that worked here walked us through our order. This place kind of reminds me of Ghengus Grill meets subway as you choose your toppings as you go along. So good."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Wednesday night, and let me tell you the food was spectacular! But unfortunately the night crew wasn't. For first time customers, they were extremely rude. But i came back the next day (since the food is just THAT good) during the morning shift, and let me tell you, the service was amazing!!! They're all SUPER polite, they explain whats what without making you feel stupid and they're cool people! My top three workers are reshawn, raggae and ali i believe her name is haha. I've been coming back everyday for the food and kick ass service! Point being, avoid the night crew, hang with the day crew!"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus I am in love! My boyfriend and I can in today not know what to expect, but Brandon hooked us all the way up! I had the dragon burrrito with mango and tempura flakes added; let's just say I found my new spot! I love poke and wanted to try a bowl, but I'm so glad it didn't. We just moved back from LA and have been on a food journey in the area! I was so delighted, I will be returning very soon! Probably, tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Neat. Best source of my japanese food craving. Decent pricing. I love the do it your own poke bowl. This will be part of my vegas faves"}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this place since there are now so many Poke bowl and sushi burrito places on Rainbow alone. But I actually really liked their sushi burrito! Compared to SoHo and Jaburrito at least.   You get to choose between a bowl or sushi burrito. I'm not a fan of poke bowls with all the filler stuff in it so I ended up going to the sushi burrito. You get your choice of protein, toppings, delicious sauces, and other veggies to go with your protein.   I went with the ahi tuna and salmon as my main protein. They were out of seaweed wrapper so I got the soy paper which was actually not bad at all. The only thing with the soy paper is that it rips very easily and becomes very soggy if you put a lot of sauce. The server was smart enough to add the sauce at the end because he knew what soggy mess my burrito would have been since I like a lot of ponzu sauce lol. You also get more topping choices of spicy tuna, crab and I can't remember the other one. Of course I got spicy tuna because I wanted more fish :P   Then you have choice of greens to put inside the burrito and I went with kale. Then you move over to the little toppings like crispy tempura crumbs, onions, peppers and all that jazz. I wanted to try more sauces but since my soy paper would not allow this I had to refrain :(  I thought the portion was pretty good and the amount of fish they put it in was more than a lot of the other sushi burrito places I've been too. The workers were really nice and there's a good amount of seating inside."}
{"text":"The place is really nice. The service is amazing. It was my first time here so I was pretty slow but they were really patient with me. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is okay. The food is pretty good but I think it could be better if the employees were more consistent.   I usually order a regular dragon bowl. Each time i order it, there was always something different. The first time i ordered it, it came with shrimp tempura. The second time, there was no shrimp tempura. The employee said that I had to upgrade to a large bowl. Third time, I upgraded to a large and still no shrimp tempura. Fourth time, the unagi that comes with it wasnt heated up."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. A friend took me here a week ago and I've been back twice already. Sooooo good. I'm seriously addicted. Clean and fresh with great staff. I need more Sweet Poke in my life"}
{"text":"I was here with my sisters last night 8.7.16 about 30min prior to closing and felt like it was to late but we were craving for Poke especially since we didn't want to drive toward the center of the city. We opted to come in and was pleasantly greeted by the staff and acknowledged us and didn't rush is to order. I understand how people want to go home when their shift is almost over but they were accommodating to our needs since it was my youngest sister first time here. However we ended up getting a large 808 and 2 small Shaka Surf Bowls and was pleased with the outcome. Everything was delicious and fresh on our visit especially the seaweed salad which happens to be our favorite whenever we go have Japanese food. I do recommend this place especially if your in a hurry and don't have time for sushi restaurant and if your unfamiliar on how to order, let the staff know because we came across a good amount of people who didn't understand the concept."}
{"text":"I was in there maybe a week ago and the guy behind the counter made me feel stupid and he was rude?! He had dark hair and wore glasses. I asked for the white paper, forgetting it was called soy, he had attitude when correcting me. I built my own burrito and had tempura shrimp that I did not want warmed and he looked at me like I was crazy and seemed like he was mad about it? He was asking my protein choices and I asked for spicy crab, annoyed he told me that I would already get that? I got tuna....I've never been there. Im new to this whole sushi burrito thing which I love!!! I dont know how this place works and If they hadn't already made my son's burrito I would have stopped the guy from finishing my burrito and left. I will never come back here just because of the horrible service. Theres to many other places to go. The food was fresh and my burrito was good!"}
{"text":"First time here.. great selections...love that you customize your entire bowl as they make it.. definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is good sushi at a reasonable price. I have yet to be dissatisfied out of five visits. Costumer service is on point and they are able to prepare dishes quickly. The fish is fresh and the crew is flexible in suggesting good combinations for your protein choice. Its a healthy choice compared to fast food options. A word to the wise is there are times when the line is out the door but this has not effected the quality of any food I have received. I have only tried the Centennial location so I can not speak of the other locations. I think you will enjoy this choice."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. We were greeted by the staff with smiles. We had questions about the menu and they answered all of them.   We ordered the eastern combo which was a burrito and a small ramen. The burrito was fresh and a good size. For the ramen we did the tonkatsu broth mild. It was good. Not as good as ramen places but since their specialty is sushi burritos and bowls it's to be expected.   They have a nice specialty beverage and dessert case by the register. We got a UCC coffee and a Japanese soda.   Overall we really liked Sweet Poke and look forward to returning and trying more items off their menu."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time a couple weeks ago the food was mediocre at best. Came back today to give it another go, they claim to not have sushi rice as they didn't have any made?? It's a poke bowl/burrito joint shouldn't that be an important ingredient to offer ? Not a fan, wish this place was better being its close to home, but there are much better sushi bowl burrito places around town."}
{"text":"First time having a sushi burrito and it did not disappoint! With all the options and it doesn't cost extra to pile up it was a win-win!"}
{"text":"Standard delicious food.  Every time I walk into a poke restaurant, I hum the tune to Pokemon.  Anyway, this place is a chipotle of poke-themed restaurants: simple, easy, and satisfying.  Prices are reasonable and I will come back again."}
{"text":"Came back for lunch!! And happy to review that the customer service has changed since the last time!!! Thanks Sweet Poke!! Great service and delicious POKE!!!will be coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"I can't review this place without getting hungry again, and I literally just ate. Their poké creations are not only appealing to the eye but delicious as well. And I thought it would be difficult to find fresh fish this far inland - boy was I wrong"}
{"text":"Service is awful. The girls behind the counter just stare at you when you're trying to read the menu making it verrrry uncomfortable. Then I wanted to order a side of rice and a couple pieces of shrimp tempura for my 1 year old and they said \"we don't do that\" so we left. I'll never be back. And I was really wanting a bowl.  Really disappointed about the bad service. I was a GM of a restaurant in town and I would fire my staff if they behaved that way.   This is the second time I tried to dine in and the first time the staff was unknowledgeable and didn't explain the menu at all"}
{"text":"I had a bowl with yellowtail and various veggies over warm rice. Everything is super fresh and delicious. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  I had an appointment in the area and was hungry and needed to grab something quick. I'm a clean eater and don't do fast food and happened to check Yelp and found this place.  Where has this been all my life lol!! I went in and was greeted by this awesome young lady who was so friendly ! I told her it was my first time and she explained all of the options and we hooked up a great bowl!  It was absolutely tasty, yummy and delicious !! I will definitely be back especially after finding out there is one in the northwest near my house!   My new go to place! Great clean eating and delish all at the same time! A must try! Fish is fresh (I'm an Ahi girl!) ...."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and they were completely empty! But the girl behind the counter was so nice she helped me with putting a bowl together since I had no idea what to order. The poke bowl was delicious, everything tasted fresh and well-made.    Now the downside: bones. Unfortunately I took a big bite and there was a bone that got lodged in my throat. Incredibly painful and scary! It took me about 20 minutes to get it out myself, the longest 20 minutes ever! So if you go here please be careful and eat slowly. I'm sure they do their best to get all the bones out but obviously they sometimes miss one."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place has almost 5 stars ... I've tried it 3x and regret it each time... ok let's start  If I get a poke bowl I'm anticipating I can get my food in a scoop on a fork.  Not the case ... the soft shell crab and the shrimp tempura comes in whole pieces... idk why this bothers me but it does ... cut up your food !! Same with the cilantro .. big ass leaves of cilantro on the bowl ...  their yum yum sauce is not that great ... I can't place it but it doesn't taste like a traditional yum yum ...  when they do warm up the shrimp tempura they managed to burn it 2 out of 2 times ... like literally the end piece is black and burned .. I tossed those pieces both times ...  they did not warm up the soft shell crab .. even tho it's tempura coated .. thought that was odd ..  idk this place just doesn't do it for me. I'd rather trek over to lake mead and rainbow for Poké then go to the place 11 minutes from my house .. Also the last time I ordered here was out of Poké desperation b.c my usual spot was out of salmon ... I ordered Uber eats where you literally check box by box what you want on your  order .. they forgot the furikake ... it's a bunch of little things that add up that will prevent me from coming back here in the future"}
{"text":"I work in the same parking lot as sweet poke and when I saw that they were opening I was so excited. I checked to see if they were open almost everyday. I am honestly say when they opened it was everything and more that I expected. It's so clean and the food is AMAZING!!! I just keep going back because I can not get enough of this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my preferred poke spots. They have a menu of options, however I usually end up having to refer back to it to see what is supposed to be in each bowl because the staff always seems to ask specifically what you want in the bowl anyways - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, since you end up customizing it to your taste more. The portion sizes are comparable to others in the area, maybe a little smaller than some other BUT they make up for it with their large variety of free toppings that you are able to add (most other places put an up charge on additional toppings).  The service is good, I have been in quite a few times and only had a significant wait once, and they apologized quite a bit, I think they could work on being more efficient when there is a line, but the staff have always been very friendly so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight really excited for sweet pokey. Was confronted by an attitude and a staff member that was less than helpful. Food was subpar / standard. Hope things change for us to come back."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for poke this is the place for you! Great bowls and lots of combinations. Additionally you can get a sushi burrito, which is a burrito sized portion of your favorite sushi roll. Yummy"}
{"text":"I make my own poke so I compared it to my recipes, this place is awesome...good flavor, good spices, good add ons, price Is ok with portion sizes, great place for a good healthy bite, our new favorite poke place."}
{"text":"My first time trying a sushi bowl.  I'm so glad my first experience with a sushi bowl was at Sweet Poké. I love sushi and was skeptical at try a sushi burrito. I'm absolutely in love. The service was excellent and the food was fresh and fabulous. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the attitude of the manager was horrible.   The person in charge Yun I think his name is kept belittling his employee Marilyn while she was helping us.  We really wanted to leave immediately when he started to be rude and yell at her in front of the customers but she kept her composer and kept assisting us.  We felt embarrassed for her and he made the atmosphere thick. And to top it off he excused his behavior by saying, \"Sorry,she's in training.\"   If I was in training and someone talked down to me and yelled at me in front of customers I would have quit on the spot. And when I asked what his name was the young man behind the counter said his name was Yun and he is the financial owner of the business. Really?? And he is representing his business like this?  Okay rant over. I just want to give praise to Marilyn for helping us and handling herself correctly in that unfortunate situation. She had a positive attitude and produced a very tasty product.   But I think we will stick to the other location for our tasty burritos because the atmosphere is more upbeat and fun there.   We had: Diego Burrito - Yummmmmmyyyyyy Kids Shrimp Burrito Meal- (which caused YUN to become a monster) 808 Poke Bowl w/rice - Awesome"}
{"text":"Second time coming here but left disappointed. First time I ordered the Hubby a bowl nothing for myself and he loved it. Today we arrived around 3:30. The kid taking our order just wasn't friendly at all. They were out of spicy tuna and spicy scallop. Nobody really seemed to know what they were doing. I decided to try their burrito but didn't compare at all to Soho Burrito. My husband said the Ahi tuna didn't taste fresh at all and that it tasted like it was beginning to go bad. Don't know if we'll be back"}
{"text":"Never disappointed!  Can make your own burrito or the recipes they have made.  Brown rice is offered.  Always fast and welcoming service.  They give you a free burrito once you have 10 visits!"}
{"text":"While everyone else is busy catching Pokemon, I am busy finding the best place to get poke in town. Poke burrito concoction is becoming a big thing with the recent opening of Soho Sushi Bowlrrito, Pokeman, To See Roll and Sweet Poke.   With so many sushi burrito places opening up, the biggest question is...what makes each shops different from each other? Is it the quality? quantity? price? service? sauce? From the looks of it, seems that they all have similar toppings with similar protein choices at similar price ranges. On my visit to Sweet Poke, I constantly found myself comparing this place to my favorite place, Pokeman.   Price was $1-2 cheaper. Same great quality fish but I actually got more. I ordered their regular burrito and they generously packed 4 scoops of salmon in my burrito. With other toppings included, they packed so much that they couldn't even roll my fat burrito. They did, but seaweed was split in half with rice and toppings spilling out from all over the place. This much food and I paid around $9 with tax. What a deal. My burrito turned out to be one ginormous but delicious burrito that I am drooling over as I write this review thinking about it.   Bowl seemed to be a bit disappointing. We got a large and regular bowl. Difference was that large comes with 4 scoops of rice while regular comes with 3. It felt like they were about the same portions which was a bit odd. Paid more, yet portion was exactly the same. I did like how it came in a microwave safe bowl that can be reused at home. Great for packing your lunch to school or work.   I will be back here. Great quality, great price and friendly service. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Delicious! Employees are nice, the portion is good, the food is fresh, a cute and casual place, I had a wonderful experience here!"}
{"text":"My fave poke place is still another joint, but this one is located on my side of town so that is a plus!  Sweet Poke is not much different from all the other sushi burrito/bowl type casual eateries that have opened up all over the valley in the last year.  All offer choices of fish protein, wrapped or in a bowl, with rice or with salad greens.  The theme is HEALTHY!  Because I guess...well, poke should be healthy.    Their menu has a lot of options for a signature burrito or bowl, make sure you read well so you know what you're getting.  This time around we orders 1 burrito and 1 bowl.  Wifey got basically a create your own sushi burrito ($9.50) - 2 scoops of protein, base, sauce & toppings.  She got a nori seaweed wrap, white rice base with salmon & crab, topped with avocado, tamago, & sweet poke house sauce.  I got the Aloha bowl ($9.50) - ahi tuna, crab, cucumber, green lettuce, tamago & sesame shoyu sauce.  The really great thing about Sweet Poke is that most of their sauces & toppings don't cost you any extra money.  So I made my bowl GIGANTOR by adding toppings of seaweed salad, furikake, cilantro, mixed greens, edamame & shredded nori!  Much more value to my liking.    Taste?  Honestly just OK for us.  Perhaps we should have tried additional sauces to compliment our burrito & bowl?  Wifey said her burrito was a bit lacking on the flavor side, with too much rice to fish ratio.  She said the fish was good though, not 'fishy' tasting at all.  My bowl was good, the ratio of rice to fish was a bit of a culprit though.  The bowl had a generous layer of rice - while I love rice being that I'm from Hawaii, there just wasn't enough protein to go around.  I liked the fact that I had all the additional veggies in my bowl, but after eating all that along with my ahi & crab mix, I still had a good portion of rice leftover.  Next time maybe I'll ask for more sauce as well.  I liked how at Sweet Poke they mix the sauce with your fish though.  It would be easy enough to ask for samples of other sauces on the side.    Pricing is on the average with most other poke places, but Sweet Poke comes in at a bit lower price of $9.50 for majority of their burritos/bowls.  You can also combo up for an additional $3 - combos come with soda and your choice of edamame, veggie chips, seaweed salad, or miso soup.     Service was fast & efficient, although we did notice they catered more to repeat customers than 1st timers like us which was OK.  We'd come back for some poke again though if the craving hit and we were on our usual side of town.  Pretty good Sweet Poke!  #ipokeyoupokeweallpoke"}
{"text":"Great New Place. Got the Dragon Burrito and it was Awesome. Not to pricey either. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"First time here, very impressed! My spicy tuna was fresh and tasty! Excellent customer service, Gia was very friendly and helpful! I'm definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood for work. About 11:00 and wasn't sure if I was in the mood for breakfast or lunch. But you can never go wrong with a poke bowl.   Decided to stop by here for a fresh bowl. Everyone was very friendly and patient with me as I tried to decide what bowl I was in the mood for. I got a build your own. It's a great deal that you get a scoop of spicy tuna in addition to your protein choices. The toppings selection has a large variety and most are included without up charge.   There are many poke bowl places popping up in the area but is one of the better ones I've been to so far."}
{"text":"I absolutely love poke, but the people and staff who works there are rude and arrogant. I am just getting into sushi and making my way up to eating more of it. So, when I went in I wasn't sure what I wanted and I kept asking questions they seemed to be annoyed and or irritated and was not a hell to me at all. This location sucks and that sucks because its the closest location to my house and I hate coming here just because the workers."}
{"text":"I love their poke. It's so fresh and they are really clean. They give good size portions. I always get the same thing every time I go there. I love the fact that they have the Perka app so can get a free poke bowl after purchasing 10 bowls or burritos. Best poke in the valley."}
{"text":"It was just not that good.  Service was slow.  The prices are not great.  The fish is average.  The wasabi was bad.  It was either dried out or someone who never ate wasabi mixed it wrong."}
{"text":"BYO poke bowls and sushi burritos are all over the place.  Let's be real here.  You're not going to find high quality poke at any of these sushi burrito spots. What's a sushi burrito?  A sushi burrito is basically a larger hand-roll with a just a lot more in it. When I go to these places, I rarely pick from their menu and usually opt to build my own.  I had them create a sushi burrito with no rice, just seaweed, salmon, imitation crab, some crunch for texture, and their chipotle menu.  Since most sushi burritos are small, I also had them add 4 scoops of their cooked salmon on the side.  My meal wasn't bad at all and compared to the rest of the sushi burrito spots in town, I think this one is the least expensive.  If you're a fan Yum Yum Rolls, then you may love a place like Sweet Poke.  The protein options is abundant and you get to choose how large you want your meal to be. Overall, the food is okay and perfect if you're looking for a quick snack.    TIP:  My BYO sushi burrito and 4 scoops of cooked salmon was less than $13.  This was about $7 cheaper than what I'm used to paying at the other sushi burrito restaurants in town.  2017 Yelp Review #200"}
{"text":"So after going to many different \"create your own poke bowl\" places I am putting my review back up after the owner messaged me to delete my review. I should've just left it on here because may be others could've relate..   When I ate here it just opened and there was barely any reviews. I walked in was greeted by the ladies working. I wanted to be in and out quick since I had plans with my family so I ordered one of the dishes on the menu instead of making own. I was watching the girl make my bowl and she messed up about 2 times like the ingredients that are in front of her was hard to understand. But I know she is still learning... I notice though that I had more rice than poke! What's up with that. The pricing wasn't right to me at the time cause how much poke I got. It was less than the ahi bowl I get at poke express and poke express gives you a load of ahi.   Taste review, definitely can taste the difference from this place to others, the time I went I probably didn't get the fresh end of the ahi. Mine tasted like it was out for awhile and chewy. Not the good chewy more like left over, refrigerated ahi. Supposedly the owner said he gets \"fresh poke unlike other places that uses frozen\"    Like I said in my first review I don't plan on coming back with the amount of poke and price. I can find other places.   This wouldn't have came back up but I was reading to many reviews that I related too."}
{"text":"Great casual poke experience if you're on the go.  My current undisputed poke champion..  Service: The staff was friendly, efficient in getting your poke bowl or sushi burrito right. 3 FTEs get you through the assembly line process quickly.  2 of them build your yummy poke creation with a cashier at the end.  Think Chipotle assembly for poke.  Food: You can order one of their pre-designed poke bowl or burrito creations or customize your own using their easy to follow menu in 4 steps: Pick your base, protein, sauce and topping.  Base and protein is easy its the sauce and additional toppings that really make this fun.    This visit I created my own bowl: Unagi + Salmon + Kale salad + Chipotle Mayo + Creamy Jalapeno + Seaweed + Corn = Lovely  All ingredients are fresh and high quality.  I've paid for much more in restaurants with much less quality.  Amazing to find the quality here in a casual poke joint.    Value:  Bowls and Burritos were at $9.50 with the combos at $12.50.  Once again, great price for the quality of ingredients.  This makes me smile  Ambiance: Plenty of seating for a franchise but I'll be ordering to go most of the time from here, because I'm always on the go.  Summary:  For the price and quality, Sweet Poke is my current go to Poke place.  The great selection across the board of to customize makes every tasty visit different.  Also, the fact that the service is efficient means I can get out of here with a tasty poke bowl in under 10 minutes.  I'm lucky not to have have any food allergies but I\"m allergic to lines. =) Keep up the sweet work. sweet poke!"}
{"text":"Amazing poke bowls. I really like the Dragon Bowl. I've been here a few times and everyone is extremely friendly. So glad we have this in centennial hills."}
{"text":"Just left Vegas two days ago and I am CRAVING Sweet Poke'!   We absolutely need one in Scottsdale please!!!  Don't get me wrong, we have some very good Poke places but none that have the menu variety with the Ramen, Surf & Turf, and Sushi Burrito's on top of the best Poke bowl & sauces I've ever had!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best poke spot in Vegas hands down will be back here many times. I love how your 10th order you will get a free poke bowl or burrito. I have yet to try the burritos here but I'm sure I will love them. The poke bowls are AMAZING, you get to pick all your ingredients and I love how fresh everything is never gotten sick from eating here like other spots. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times.  The first 2 was a great experience I got my burrito and bowl quick this third wasn't so great.  Let's start off with the fact that they had 4 employees this time.  It took almost 15 minutes from once I placed the order to when I checked out.  I originally always get the same thing.  Spicy tuna burrito with brown rice and a couple of vegetables.  They gave me one scoop and spread it to the point that all I was eating was rice and veggies.  When I brought up my concern the cashier gave me some BS about how they get fresh fish everyday so he'll charge me the kids.  In my head I'm screaming at this point.  I told him that last time I got 2 scoops charged the full amount and I was satisfied if I have to pay more I will but instead he had the other guy rolled up my burrito obviously clearly telling me no and then offered me a drink afterwords.  A free drink isn't going to make up for your service besides the kids you have behind the counter were obviously under pressure.  TOOTSIE ROLL is opening down the street let's see if they're a little better."}
{"text":"Nice clean place... They give u nice full scoops of fish. They gave me the spicy tuna but wanted the crab and one of the worker gave it to me anyways ... So nice of him ... Will come back again"}
{"text":"Good food but they need more help.  2 ahead of me but still waiting 20 minutes so far...."}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans and our poke bowl scene isn't so great. However, this place was only 5 minutes away from where I was staying and I decided to give this place a shot. The staff here are friendly and patient esp with me since I never know what I want. The proportion are huge and I was getting full so fast."}
{"text":"Fresh & delicious! I had the shrimp lovers sushi burrito. It was perfect! The taro chips are also yummy. They had a sweet seaweed seasoning that was so good. This restaurant it also very clean. We love it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for ages now! I stop in here atleast once every 2 weeks if not more. I love it. The food is great and the staff is awesome as well.   I use the Perka app and check in so that my points automatically go into the system. For every 10 orders you get a free one. Woohoo! I love loyalty points.   I'm pretty basic and get the same thing everytime I go in. I do alternate between the burrito and the bowl. Today I went for the bowl because I wanted to make it more like a salad. I love that you can put pretty much anything in your food with no extra charge. I like to load mine up with veggies and extra extra creamy jalepeno sauce.   My go to creation is cooked shrimp, 2 scoops spicy crab, extra creamy jalepeno, lettuce, cilantro, cucumber, avocado, and tempura crunch. Might seem basic but I love it."}
{"text":"My daughter said a sushi burrito would change my life and it did!  Great service.  Really nice people working there!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for dinner last week and it was really pretty cool! The fish was fresh and I love the concept!  Fresh fish, rice and veggie --- you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Favorite poke spot hands down! Best sizes, great service, a regular go to spot! And the broth is amazing, also, they have free flavored or enhanced water."}
{"text":"Staff was great taking the time to allow us to try the different sauces till we each found one we liked. Eel melted in your mouth.  We each got the two scoops and we were full but would have love to have more. Great location and great seating"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and will continue to go. I have never been disappointed, my family and I love this place. It's like a sushi subway."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Fresh fish, lots of add on options and super friendly staff. I love the fact they don't pack their bowls with rice. I'd eat here 5 days a week if I lived closer.   My favorite is the citrus salmon bowl. I get it with their jalapeño sauce. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! I got a large bowl and just customized my own. I went with 2 sauces, sweet poke sauce and a shoyu sauce. Sweet and a little spice kick to it.   I like that there's a few different options that the other sushi burrito places popping up done have like scallops."}
{"text":"My favorite build your own poke place. The location is uncluttered, clean, well lit, and the staff is professional.   The fish is fresh, the sauces have distinct flavors that are not overwhelmed with sugar. I appreciate the choice of using tofu base, which makes it easy to create low carb bowls.   They just started serving a caramelized garlic crunch that has a bite of a bitw and a bit of sweetness.   Go to bowl : tofu base, half tuna, half eel, sea weed, tuna topping, cucumber,  garlic crunch, tempura crunch , switch up the sauce.    It's flavorful and filling without making you want to take a nap."}
{"text":"A lot of reviews on here talked about the service, and to an extent, they're right. Everyone was very nice and the effort was there, but you could tell there wasn't a lot of experience back there and it was somewhat of a free for all. It kind of felt like a bunch of kids put a poke stand together to raise some money for a class trip.  I think once they find their groove, get more familiar with the menu and the system they have in place, and maybe change a few little things (that sneeze guard is way too high, put labels over the ingredients so the customers know what's what, etc.), it's gonna be a much smoother experience for us and them.   Oh, the food. The food is great. My girl and I both got large 808 bowls (basically tuna with more tuna) and shared a cooked shrimp roll, and everything was fresh tasting and spot on. The part at the end where you can toss in some free extra ingredients totally made it for me. The only real downside is we both got the edimame side, and they were super cold with zero salt. Mmm...no.   Definitely rough around the edges, but the crew will just get better with experience, the food was great, and we will be back."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  The way you can put together all the different choices makes the result fantastically delicious.  I love the various burrito choices, you cannot go wrong with any of them, and you can add more food items than what the menu shows.  Worth every penny.  Sushi burritos are the new age bomb!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi burrito place I've ever been to. They have so many options that are phenomenal! Sushi burrito with brown rice! Also, everything is included unlike the majority of sushi burrito place that add extra for avocado,masago, or seaweed salad. Here it's all included! Sushi burrito is massive for $9.50."}
{"text":"This place is real good! I've eaten at both Ja Burrito and Soho Burrito and felt that this place was better. To me, I could taste the difference in fish quality, and I though this place was more superior. And that wasabi yuzu! Awesome!!!  This place doesn't have a plethora of options of additional proteins and toppings, but still good.   Being that is new, staff is still learning and there was a slight technical difficulty, but overall didn't hinder my experience.  One thing I wish they had was taro chips! I didn't see they had one on the menu they just had \"veggie chips.\" That's too vague for me."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and eagerly awaited the opening of this restaurant in June. It has not disappointed once in the 1 or 2 ( oh who am I kidding) 11 times I have been in since then. This is exactly the sort of place that this area needed. The staff is friendly, still learning the flow a bit, but I completely understand. Food is great, I get the bowls, and there are so many options to customize with I will never have the exact same thing twice!while not the only Asian food in the area, it is now my number one! In fact I'm taking a friend for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Thank you very much Chase for making my 1st visit to Sweet Poke very enjoyable! You took the time to explain the setup and my options.   Chase showed EXCELLENT customer service when making recommendations as well as most popular item.  I ultimately selected the shrimp lover bowl and LOVE IT!   Thank you Chase for the GREAT EXPERIENCE AND AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"The employees are young, polite and professional. The food is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good burrito will come again just wish the tofu was a bit more firm, other than that excellent!"}
{"text":"what's up with this new fad? poke galore everywhere! Seems like these poke places are opening up all over Las Vegas. This place was just ok. Had a large bowl with salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. Sashimi was not super fresh, topping were just ok, but the crab on it was great. Also I got a yuzu wasabi dressing it was pretty strange and overpowered most of the flavors. Normally I would say ok, good enough, but with the competition in this area now, it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Was in search of a good poke bowl. This place hit the spot!!! Proteins are FRESH!!!  They have octopus which was also super fresh!!!Staff was extremely friendly and patient!! It being our first time, and not exactly sure of what we wanted to mix in. Pricing wasn't as bad for the portions. This is probably going to be my new go to!!"}
{"text":"I got a sushi burrito and it was yummy! I liked that I had the option of two protiens (I got shrimp tempura and baked salmon) and still got to add crab. I appreciated the many unlimited options including tamago, mango, pineapple and cantaloupe. I asked if there is an incentive if I check in, and the manager gave me a seaweed salad. There's also a freezer with little tacos and small bites. Next time I'll try the bowl! I would come back here."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead via chownow and picked up on my way to work. Best sushi burrito I have tasted. Ingredients were fresh. Nice ratio of fish (salmon) to rice. Plan to go here again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a few months now and I have yet to have an item I didn't completely love! My latest kick is the dragon with sick crab, pineapple and their friend onions... so good!!   Only bad part is every time I come in they are packed (rightfully so) but they get through the line quickly.   Staff is friendly,  food is awesome, and I can't say enough good things about them! A must try!"}
{"text":"Good, but I've had better.  Sweet Poke is definitely the best poke bowl spot out on the Henderson-ish side of town. If you're ok with just poke (not bowl style without the extra toppings, I can think of only one place that's better!).  The shop is clean and doesn't have that fishy smell like some of the other poke places in town. It's safe to eat in! Haha. Parking is easy to find, but getting back on to the freeway is a HUGE hassle and requires a U-turn at some point. The menu states that avocado and tamago are extra, but they mean extra is extra......  The spicy ginger is my favorite sauce that they have. It's not spicy at all and went well with my white rice bowl. The soy ginger was also recommended to me, but it didn't have as much flavor."}
{"text":"Poke bowl idea A-okay.   Monkey do:  Large bowl $11.50  Base: spinach Protein: yellowtail unagi salmon Toppings: corn edamame mango avocado spicy tuna  Sauce: sesame   Tall glass sneeze barrier between you and assembly line, so speak up and enunciate. Monkey ask for yellowtail, unagi and salmon. Difficult to hear but good thing in my line of work, I read lips. Irks me when our younger generation is missing out on a proper education. Salmon is pronounced \"SA MON\" not saLmon. Say what?  I watch her tongue curL up and fLick the back of her front teeth to purposely use the L. SALmon. Sigh.   Anyway, my fish saLad was okay, with 3 siLLy LittLe scoops of fish, even when spicy tuna is considered a topping. Monkey come hungry and left hungry and sweaty. and in search of fLoss. Maybe do haLf rice for base next time. Service heLpfuL, friendLy and patient. Sure, Monkey return since it's cLose, but I'd rather do a pound of Poke at Monkey favorite Hawaiian restaurant."}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot. Good sushi bowls and burritos. At least once a week.  Love this place. Hamachi San and citrus bowl my go to!"}
{"text":"Poke bowls are the crack and I am glad a joint selling them opened in Centennial, as I no longer have to endure a long drive to get my fix. However, when I was fantasizing about such restaurant opening close to my house, I imagined it to be magical and Sweet Poke is just not... To be fair, the fish and other add-ons were fresh. I ordered a bowl with Tuna, crab, masago, brown rice, spinach, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, carrot, seaweed salad, cilantro, and mistakenly HOT pepper. I also got sweet poke house sauce and yum yum sauce on the side. The bowl was delicious! I wasn't crazy about the sauces though preferred the Sweet Poke House Sauce over Yum Yum. It appears as most of their sauces have a mayo-e base and consistency and I am not a fan of mayo. The ordering process was a bit confusing to me. I ordered the Ahi Lover and was asked to build my own bowl in the process. The Ahi Lover bowl has Tuna and Spicy Tuna in it, I only got one type and when I mentioned the ingredients that are listed for the bowl I requested, I was ignored and asked to continue listing what I wanted. My bowl came out to be $13 before tip while I ordered regular size. Now, I did add a scoop of crab while going along the line of ingredients, I assume that has to cost more but at no point was I told that there will be an extra charge. The menu does not list the cost of additional protein either. The price point is not high enough for me to worry about the ambiguity but prices should not be a secret."}
{"text":"This is probably the best poke place that I've been to in all of Las Vegas!!! I ordered the Vegas burrito and my friend ordered the ahi lover. They were both AMAZING!! The fish is of good quality. It's doesn't have any super fishy taste at all. It tastes very fresh. In the Vegas burrito, they put amazing mango salsa, which I have learned that they make IN HOUSE! Fresh mango salsa!? Yes please! As for my friends burrito, they weren't kidding when they named it the Ahi lover. There's fresh ahi tossed in this sweet/spicy sauce and has extra spicy tuna as a topping. Yum!!! The portions are good and the staff is very friendly. I will for sure be coming back soon."}
{"text":"First time coming here today and I'm hooked!!! I asked what was their most popular items and they gave me a breakdown based on what doh I enjoyed which was really helpful. Because not too big on raw fish they said to try the shrimp lover and boy were they on point with that recommendation! The shrimp was generous and I put one spicy crab on their fora little kick. the spicy crab had the perfect spice to it and I'll be having that every time I come in. The staff was friend and helpful even tho they wer slammed!! 5 stars for sure"}
{"text":"Make your own bowels a real healthy mealfor $10. Ingredients are always fresh in the staff is friendly and helpful a great place to dashing to get carry-out lunch or something to take along to a party I'm very careful where I eat sushi and this place has never let me down"}
{"text":"We just tried this spot for the first time.  We came hungry.  Unfortunately they were hit hard today and we're out of alot.  They tried their best and still made a pretty good meal.  They are very new and still need to work out some kinks.  The burritos are not wrapped as an example. They fall apart pretty easy.  Also they surprisingly don't use sushi vinegar and sugar in their rice.  It's just rice. The texture and flavor are not there,not like you would expect.   So there is an opportunity for improvement.   They are a little confused still but it's so new that can be expected.   I ordered several burritos but still with them being out of so much I still have not tried them IMO.  I wish they would have discounted our stuff a little as spicy crab was substituted for spicy tuna.  In the end Soho is better still but this place is close and has a lot of potential.  It's nice and bright and clean.  I like that."}
{"text":"New place... very clean, friendly staff, fresh food.. enjoyed lunch! Will be coming back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Sweet Poke has all of the essentials of a good spot: fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and inexpensive prices.   There are bowl, salad and sushiritto options available to obtain whatever calorie count you're looking for! In addition, they have brown rice. There is no price difference between salmon or tuna, which is a win! Usually the more desired tuna is a buck or three more.   With their reward program, every 11th poke is free!"}
{"text":"Location - mahalo for opening out in this side of da town Service - greeted and when we were ready, the helper was definitely new.  He kept looking at the menu and asked questions on items to add.  He was kind.  Just needs to speak a little louder.  There was a haole helper seemed rude to the customer behind us.  She said, 'what can I get you', seriously?  I read other reviews.  They do need caring, customer service helpers.  And they all don't have to watch someone sweep the floor.  There's 5 of them.  But when I said I was ready.  Young kid was nice and helped.   Food - we looked at all their food, so far looked good.  It may look like they measure all their food.  I am good with dat.  Took citrus burrito home.  Ono! I have ate at soho burrito, jah burrito, Poke express. Overall, I will return.  Just work on service and faster service workers with a welcome (Aloha) smile.  Watch how the other poke locations have happy employees that apparently very knowledgeable what they are creating.  And make sure someone takes ownership of each customer coming thru dat door till they leave, we were thanks for coming in.  More like, I said what I said and they paid their out.  Hope you stick around and good luck"}
{"text":"Update: went back again today and it was definitely better. The guy at the counter helped me out with suggestions and gave me a great discount. Will be back"}
{"text":"As a connoisseur of poke restaurants, this may be my new fave. Staff went above and beyond to welcome me and help me make my decision. They have the option to build your own bowl or burrito or they have flavor combinations already picked out. The salad bowl I ordered had huge chunks of fish and fresh, crisp vegetables. I ordered a combo that came with taro chips and some kind of a green dipping sauce. Not sure what the sauce was but I couldn't get enough of it! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't like that they don't take orders over the phone. You HAVE TO do it online. After I called and was informed I had to order online, I ordered an ahi lover roll. It was pretty good, wish I would've ordered something that had some kind of a sauce on it. There was an abundant amount of fish and it was really fresh but I would try something else next time."}
{"text":"By far the best poke bowls I have ever had. They have so many options and don't make you pay extra for everything. Super yummy and healthy!!"}
{"text":"We have tried several other sushi burrito locations, and we're excited one was open near our house. I expected this place to be poppin' on a Friday night but there was only a few people. My group of three got two burritos and a bowl. My only comment was that the service was not as energetic as the other similar establishments. Employees mumbled, so creating my own burrito was a little messy. The way the ingredients were not ordered as I was used to, so that was a little confusing. All that aside, my burrito was amazing! The tempura shrimp was warm and crunchy, and the pineapple and chipotle mayo were excellent additions. It was a smidge pricey, but I think we will come back here. Mostly because of the closet location."}
{"text":"I've been on a poke kick lately so I'm always happy to add a new source to my bookmarked list. Seems like poke is abundant in Vegas lately.   First off, Yum!   Next, Friday 11:30AM, no line. This was nice. But the menu is super extensive so I can see how taking a few minutes to decide what you want will be helpful. Not sure if they have hand held menus because for someone with bad eyes like me, that would be helpful.  Lastly, got the Shaka Surf. It was good! My salmon/fish portion was a little small and I was definitely left with rice to spare. I like that their house sauce has a kick to it and it's very tasty. Not a huge fan of all the veggies you can opt for so I just put lettuce and seaweed on top. Anyhow, I'll have to come back and try something else soon.   Staff is still working on getting their menu memorization down so give them a break :)   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite quick sushi fix spots. I have tried the other location but the centennial location by far is my favorite. Not only does the food always taste fresh and delicious but the staff here is amazing! They are always so nice, they acknowledge you as soon as walking in the door and are always so quick with your order. When you are in a rush and are craving sushi I highly recommend Sweet Poke. The portions of food are very fulfilling and the price so reasonable!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they are so friendly and helpful. The ingredients are fresh and the restaurant is very clean. We definitely will be coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"So good! They were really helpful in walking you through what everything was. My mom is not very adventurous when it comes to food but she LOVED the shrimp lover bowl. I had the dragon roll and it was great!"}
{"text":"Love sweet poke!  Get your sushi fix at low prices.  All the food I've had tasted fresh.  I always leave there full.  Cant beat the value."}
{"text":"Poke here is for mainlanders, go to Paina Cafe or Poke express for legit Hawaiian poke. The employees rather focus on their sides conversations then pay attention to customers orders, then look at you crazy if you ask for something. Then get mad cus you don't tip. 2 stars cus of large portions but definitely never returning here."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! I've been craving it ever since I went. I got the dragon burrito and added seaweed salad and jalapeño. I love that you get options from the type of rice to the sauces and toppings you add and non of it is extra. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of their menu items and look forward to trying them all but its also great to be able to make your own specially if you want to keep it a little healthier."}
{"text":"LOVE this place... my go to for poke. The staff is very helpful and very patient if you're unsure what you want.....or just don't know how to order."}
{"text":"The food and service here is one of the best in Vegas. I recommend this place highly!!!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the first poké spots in the SW that I visited (then like three more opened up in the area). So far I am extremely happy with every experience that I have had here. I'm usually one to complain but this place is SOLID - proportions, sauces/flavor, freshness, the customer service. I really enjoy that they have an SMS rewards system (more reason for me to come back). As long as the employees are sweet, I will always come back!"}
{"text":"This place was easy to order and you could build your own. Price is great for what you get! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food is good. It takes a while to make, especially if there's along line. Everything is made to order, one by one, so it takes a long time for each order. The kids behind the counter sometimes can't hear what you say, so you have to repeat yourself, and vise versa. But otherwise a good stop for some sushi inspired foods. I always order a tuna bowl with spicy tuna and other toppings. It's nice that you can add most of the toppings without additional cost, so you make it to your taste."}
{"text":"Great place, it seems that sushi burritos and bowls are the way to go and the fad right now. I have to say I really enjoy these types of places. I prefer the bowl style.  I was disappointed in this place because they don't offer crabmeat, generally it's fake crabmeat of course, but I don't eat raw sushi so crabmeat would've been nice to have like Other places offer.  I did suggest it and they were receptive. Very friendly staff. Restaurant was clean. My husband absolutely loves this place. Their sushi tastes fresh.  UPDATED TO ADD:  Increased my rating from 4 stars to 5 because they DO have crabmeat. Apparently they were just out that first time we went. We gave them another try yesterday and they had crab; it was delicious. They also really pack their bowls so you get a good size meal!"}
{"text":"Came in here for pickup last night before seeing the new Star Wars.  This was my first experience in poke bowls ever, not to mention my first experience here, and they have created a new regular customer! The staff was friendly and greeted me promptly. The wait was not too long, and the employees were helping customers at a proper pace. I ordered two almost identical custom bowls. The staff was very thorough with making sure I got exactly what I was asking for on both bowls. They even made sure I understood about the tiny upcharge for adding cream cheese to the bowl. (I was already aware from doing my research online, but was glad they still made sure). The quality of the food was excellent. The friend I bought the other bowl for was  poke bowl virgin too, and he thoroughly enjoyed his bowl as well. I cannot wait to go back and try another bowl. The regular (two scoop) size was more than I expected, and will probably try the large size next (can't have too much ahi tuna!). There are lots of options, and cannot wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today, and I am so glad that I did. I have never had a sushi burrito before, so I didn't quite know what to expect when I went in. I was warmly greeted by the girl behind the counter. I told her that I had never been there before, and she warmly suggested what kind of sauce and toppings would go well with what I was ordering. I'm glad I listened to her, because as soon as I took the first bite, I was hooked. A little pricey, yes, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest.  i am a normal visitor to this restaurant.  however my visit today was terrible.  My food was prepared properly many times before and am here often , like last night with a client was the last time.  however this time was different. the girl was not listening to me or even another co worker.  then i said yes to crab and i also wanted the salsa she told me it was a dollar. which was fine. then i said you forgot the crab. she didn't listen continued to roll it with no care of the rest of the stuff i wanted on it then rang me up No drinks no nothing. I told her she missed it she was like what not enough protein.  it didn't matter never asked what size nothing.  then when i asked to speak to the manager. i said she needs to listen and learn to take orders his response was not an apology it was ive seen her make it a hundred times she does it right.  wtf thanks as i told you after i paid the ten bucks you can keep it and handed it back to you. and didn't request a refund so you know how serious i was!

{"text":"Sweet is Poke is relatively new to the centennial area. (Been open for approximately 2 weeks) If you haven't had Poke think of it it as deconstructed sushi (almost) in a bowl and if you haven't had a sushi burrito, it's a bigger sushi roll cut down the middle. The portions are generous, fish are freshly cut, decent prices and the flavors are delicious. I've probably been here along with my girlfriend about every other day. Hell, I feel like all of my money goes into the place. It's funny because one day we craved poke and were about to drive across town until we found this on Our side. definitely one of the biggest surprises and gems, a must try. Strongly recommend the salmon Shaka and if you want extra protein it's typically about $2.50 more. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Good Food, Employees are Nice and will do their best to help you out:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Good fish, good ingredients. It's one of two places now that I'll order fish."}
{"text":"I forgot the gentlemen's name that helped my friend & I but he was hands down fantastic! He helped us decide between some options we were unsure about! Love the fact that you can build your Pokè bowl. The amount of food given for the regular bowl is a lot too! Will definitely be going again! Oh & their loyalty program is through text messages & not through a card that you have to bring in. Makes it easy!"}
{"text":"Best poke bowl place in Vegas! They give you lots of topping without extra charge and the fish is really fresh! Very good value and great service."}
{"text":"I don't really like these new, fancy poke bowls that are served with dozen different toppings. As such, I came here with the mindset of ordering something simple. I ended up getting the \"Shaka Surf\" poke bowl which is made with minimal ingredients (basically salmon, masago, green onion, tempura crunch, and special sauce). I got it with white rice and cucumber on the side; it also comes with a side of crab. I got a regular size, which includes 2 scoops of protein. It's not small, but it's also not big (you can upsize to a large); my bowl looked very small compared to the customer ahead of me who had a mound of lettuce and other toppings.  The salmon poke was delicious. The sauce that they use in it is a little mild and doesn't overpower the salmon. The salmon itself was good. The sliced cucumber wasn't great; I could tell it wasn't super fresh. The seaweed salad that I got with the combo #4 (includes bowl/burrito, seaweed salad, and drink) was crunchy and delicious.  The interior feels a big too clinical, with the blank white walls and open space. I feel like a little bit of artwork would liven up the place a bit. The staff seems to be knowledgeable enough, though I could tell that the girl making my bowl was a little too cautious with adding ingredients. The bowl I ordered also didn't state any more additional toppings, yet she asked if I wanted any greens and such, so be aware of what comes in the premade bowl.  I give this place 4 stars for a simple menu (a little more so than others), clean interior, and yummy \"Shaka Surf\"."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Everything FRESH!!! Love that I can see the ingredients and pick what I want! They have quite a few selections but build your own bowl or burrito. Lots of fun and can taste different every time with different sauces and bases. Must go!"}
{"text":"its only been open for a short time but i've made my way over here twice ! loooooooooove the sushi burritos. they even warm it up for me at my request. will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open. Like any other poke place, you get to make your own creation - bowl or burrito - or order something off the menu.   MENU: First, you decide if you want a bowl or burrito. Options include white rice, brown rice, organic tofu, salad. Next, you choose your fish and mix it with extra toppings like masago and green onions. Then, you choose your toppings. Lastly, sauce is added. When I ordered, I got confused because I was asked about sauce after the second step. I originally assumed that the sauce was the salad dressing (which I always get on the side) but I think the sauce is meant to marinate the fish mixture. Anyways, don't get confused like me.   FOOD:  I ordered a salad with two scoops of salmon with crab, seaweed, masago, green onions, and creamy jalapeño sauce on the side. **Side note for the business: you should always ask if the customer wants sesame seeds in their meal. Some people may be allergic and some people may not like the flavor. This concerned me when the person automatically poured in sesame seeds.**  PRICING: Two scoops of protein costs $8.99 and three scoops cost $11.99. Scoops are small in my opinion. Extra toppings like green onion and masago and avocado cost extra, I believe.   QUALITY/TASTE: I wasn't blown away by the way the ingredients tastes. It was just an average poke bowl to me.    CUSTOMER SERVICE: Workers are friendly but also new to their role. I think they should ask the customer if they've ever been here before and if not, review the ordering process.   Overall, I'll only come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time going in there .... wasn't disappointed , I had help getting me through ordering my burrito. And I was just in heaven got my sushi fix.. very good portions . I'll definitely stop by again .. it's a bit pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"I love their sushi burritos! An incredible amount of delicious food for the price. And their amount of topping choices feels endless.     I've only had the sushi so far, but will definitely try the ramen bowls too once it cools down a bit :)"}
{"text":"I got the 2 scoops with salmon & eel.  The salmon was very fishy! So that to me means that it's not very fresh :( then.. when I asked for the eel, we were asking the worker if we were getting some meat of the fish & they assured us we were, come to find out.. all it was was skin!   Never coming back here. Idk if it's because they just opened but the staff were nice."}
{"text":"I love poke! I'm so glad this place is near my workplace. Just like your any standard poke place, you have the option of burrito, bowl, salad..etc. I chose the bowl with brown rice. My toppings consisted of the tuna double scoop. I chose the spicy mayo and the garlic ponzu sauce mix in and it was simply amazing. They also give you a choice of spicy crab or spicy tuna as a topping. Most poke places have spicy tuna as their protein option. So it's pretty nice to get my tuna fix with spicy tuna and the double scoop tuna as well. They also have a wide selection of toppings to put on as well. I chose the seaweed salad, edamamme, cucumber, cabbage and a few others I can't remember.   Overall the price is the standard of any other pike place in town. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"So my first visit at sweet poke wasn't the best. I thought it was bland & wasn't anything special. But then I realized I done messed up cos I told them not to put that much sauce cos diet. LOL   I was greeted when I walked through the door. I felt bad that I was coming in at the last hour but I needed a healthy meal after my workout. They had already started cleaning up and some chairs were on top of the table.   Sweet poke is similar to the poke places that popped up on rainbow recently, \"chipotle style\" if you will. I think what sets this place apart from the others is that they don't have a crazy amount of prepared bowls to choose from, but the ones that are there seem really good! Their fish is very fresh & im delighted to see that they have spicy crab. You should definitely try the spicy ginger shoyu or something like that, it's bomb! Will definitely be back since it's down the street from my house & because of the good quality!"}
{"text":"Recently moved from Hawaii and have tried at least 6 diff places for poke bowls and this place beats them all by a long shot. Super yummy and the price can't be beat.  Addicted!"}
{"text":"Friendly staffs. Many options for toppings and sauces. Healthy choice for lunch and dinner. The most delicious Poke in town!"}
{"text":"We eat here often when we're in the area. Today was a disappointment. Got takeout, went home and when I tasted it, it was bland. Turns out they didn't put the dressing .... and a few other stuff. Serving is also smaller than usual"}
{"text":"I like this sushi burrito spot the best, I've tried many other places and this place gives you a bang for your buck. For the price you pay you get quite a bit and they don't stick you with all kinds of extra charges for small amounts of extra ingredients.   If you are wanting to eat sushi but want to put your own ingredients in it then this is the spot for sure. You can even make a bowl if your not down with the Nori action.. but you just can't go wrong for damn sure"}
{"text":"Fresh - delicious - outstanding service, quick & friendly.  Not enough stars or words to describe how much we love Sweet Poke.   They even have a drive thru..BOOM  SO glad we found it!!"}
{"text":"Just came for the first time and walked in and the smell of construction was pretty over powering. I get its new but the smell of cement and dust doesn't make me want to eat .  The employees were nice, I was not greeted as I came in or even after a min of standing there.   I felt their portions were pretty small compared or other places. And over all the food was kinda bland. I prob won't be coming back. I didn't even finish my bowl got grossed out by the salmon and my hard rice.   I was pretty disappointed there was no ginger, jalapeño and wasabi bar area.  Jaburritos is much better tasting  and you get more for your money."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be the party pooper here. I was very excited to try this place out since it is only 5 mins away from home. And given, it has only been a couple of days since opening. Parts of my rice was crunchy and cold, some of it was warm. How can you open an Asian restaurant and not even get the rice right?  Secondly, portion is way smaller than other places like Jaburrito and Soho Burrito for the same price.  The ordering window is either too tall or too thick- I'm screaming across my order to the poor girl who can hardly hear me. I like the menu, it features tofu as a base. I also like the Coca Cola refrigerator that features more drink options like RAMUNE, Vita Coco, Oolong Tea and Japanese Coffee in a can. Very clean and spacious dining space.   Other than that, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Recommended place to try. It's best to look how to order and what your would like before stepping in line. These guys are fast :)   Parking: lots. Part of a strip mall.   Inside: clean, good light, lots of table, AC cool.  Food: Pepsi products  (i prefer coke products). Food taste good. Would be better if they had a different type of mayo sauce in addition to mayo chipotle. Lots of selections. I like this type of ordering. Pick bowl or wrap,  pick starch, pick size, regular = 2 small scoops of protien, Large is 3 scoops, choose your sauce and then she will toss the sauce and protien and put mixture on your starch. Then pick greens, and other assorted toppings (this is included in the price).   Service: good, fast, sometimes hard to hear talking through the high glass (much more sanitary thank you!) 4 people taking/making orders and one cashier made for getting in and out very fast.   I had large bowl, half rice, 2 ahi, 1 salmon, chipotle mayo (not my favorite but that was the only \"mayo\" I saw on the list.) My bowl was good. This would be my #2 spot. I ate here only because my #1 spot is too far away right now.   Enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"I like this place for what I like to eat. I get a bowl. I like salmon. The sauces are good."}
{"text":"I regularly come here but today will be my last day setting foot in this location. Employees sitting on the job. Coughing uncontrollably over food. They started to dance while there was a line. Messing up peoples orders as well as being unprepared. And to top it all of employee starts playing with wasabi making a smiley face while customers were not being helped."}
{"text":"I was craving poke today and originally planned on finding something closer to my route home but I was too afraid that any other place wouldn't be as good as this one. Especially this location with such an awesome staff that always look like they're having a good time. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have to say that I always have a good experience here.   The menu has a good range of protein and sauce options, as well as standard veggie options. You have the options of either a sushi burrito or bowl. I've had eel, scallops, salmon, & shrimp, all of which tasted fresh and delicious. In addition, they have a selection of Asian snacks, desserts, and drinks.   The service is decent, the staff is nice and they work at a fast pace. Also, the restaurant is VERY clean and organized, which I really appreciate.   Overall a great, clean, and friendly little spot with great food."}
{"text":"Love love love Sweet Poke. Always so fresh & tasty. Restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and clean, staff is very friendly. I only have one request: PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING A LOCATION CLOSER TO LAKE LAS VEGAS! We are dying over here for good restaurants. I know lots of my neighbor peeps who would frequent regularly and who think Eastern is too far of a drive...(hint: The new Cadence shopping center going in where flagship Smith's is being built would be ideal!!)."}
{"text":"Fresh Poke is what I would name this place. It is. The fish is pretty fresh. No gristle. For about the same price as the Albertsons sushi tray that I occasionally buy on the fly, this far surpasses it. The processed ones always have this weird acetic taste to it, kind of like vinegar. With the rice, sticky enough to be used as kindergarten paste. Anyhoo, the process here is similar to Chipotles. You choose different items to build your own OR you can choose one of their prebuilt ones ( if you are the type who needs a handbook playing tinker toys).  You choose your rice, white, brown, tofu, salad, half and half. I chose the 3 scoop so I can get 3 different scoops of \"base\" and 3 types of protein. I chose the brown rice and tofu. Chose the tuna, salmon, and yellow tail for my protein. The 2 scoops was about $8.99 and 3 scoops $11.99 I think.  You get to choose sides and sauces. I chose the sesame shoyu. It was a bit sweeter than I like. I like my shoyu without mayo dressing in it. Kind of like how Costco's Poke is when they have it....the Hawai'i Costco has way better Poke FYI. The shoyu sauce is basically shoyu and thinly cut green onions. Some chives would be great too!  All in all, not bad. I would come again. Everything was fresh. The only thing I don't like is that the menu is a little confusing. You can add many things but some items cost extra. I've yet to see ones where they separate the added cost items from the free ones that are easily discernible to the customer (talking about you Jimmy Johns! The one and only time I went there, I ordered a sandwich with lettuce and tomato in it only bc I thought all the other items were additional cost items. None of the staff bothered to tell me what I could add so I ended up with a tasteless sandwich. As to be expected since they spent all their training money in those nifty \"so fast\" commercials that they forgot to tell the staff to do more than stand around and emit CO2).  Service was very friendly and they helped me decipher the BIG menu.  Afterwards I went Poke hunting in Lake Las Vegas. Don't go there, not worth the trouble. They have some water based Pokemon but they all escape anyway."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ! Always fresh and everyone friendly! So glad they added the Ramen Bowl! New additions Watermelon bowl & the strawberry burrito! So excited to try them!"}
{"text":"My sushi burrito was really good, I tried the shrimp lovers. The only thing that would have made it better is if the shrimp tempura was fresh, and crunchy instead of soggy and soft. But still very yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi burrito place.    Styled like a Chipotle, you get a wide variety of options for your bowl or burrito. Most add-ons are free, which sets it apart from Soho and other places. I prefer to have a stuffed burrito or overflowing bowl. Even with the presets I get to customize my scoops of fish.   For the taste, it's fairly tasty. Fish tastes fairly fresh to me.  The sauces are nice and the veggies are fresh.  I don't stray too far from the Shaka Surf or Hamachi San. To me, the sushi burrito places all taste pretty good, so then it comes down to price and service.  Everyone is pleasant and I typically don't get any trouble getting what I want (which isn't terribly complicated to begin with).   The store atmosphere is pretty austere but I come here for the food and don't typically stay long.  I have a eating out budget but definitely don't regret the many times I come here."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious! The raw fish is amazingly fresh, and my sushi burrito was amazing. The price is... fair. It's still a bit expensive (considering 2 burrito meals could buy you 1 AYCE meal at a sushi restaurant), but it's something great for on the go! I can definitely see myself using this place as a way to get my quick \"fix\" of sushi (it's close enough to sushi haha). One more small complaint is I wish that the side order comes in larger portions, the meal comes with a sushi burrito, a small order of edamame (or other selections) and a one size for all drink (their could be a bigger cup size too)."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!!! Healthy and taste great and they give you a BUNCH of food. Here every other Weekend. Employees are always happy which makes it even better to come."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. The guy behind the counter was so sweet and gave wonderful suggestions. I like the BUILD YOUR OWN options. We ended up going back the next day  The only downside is that service is a little slow because they only can have 2 workers at a time at the counter. The plus side of that is they are 100% focused on your order.  My faves were the calamari, wasabi aioli sauce and the salmon was delish"}
{"text":"Amazing poké! My friend and I frequent this location and have consistently been impressed with not only the quality of the food, but the kindness of the staff. Always greeted with a smile and never \"shorter\" on ingredients. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my brother. We both ordered a customizable Pokè bowl. I started off with brown rice and the choice of protein salmon and yellowtail. I chose their house sauce which was sweet with a tad of spice. And the toppings I ordered was spicy tuna, onions, cucumber and avocado.  They have a wide variety of mixes to choose from or you could choose their suggested combos. The options of the type of base are bowls or burritos.   Staff was very friendly and helpful. They offered very good suggestions to get the best out of your meal.  The place was very clean and spacious. It is very modernized and I enjoyed my time while I was there."}
{"text":"I went to this location when they first opened & wasn't a fan, but now that I gave it another chance, I'm a big fan. It's the best choice to go to in the area.  My go-to healthy meal is a large salad bowl with lettuce & all salmon, spicy ginger shoyu on the salmon & sesame shoyu on the salad, topped with crab, spicy crab & seaweed salad.  I love that you can get a scoop of either crab, spicy crab & spicy tuna as a topping choice where other poké locations charge it as protein.  They give out good portions & the workers are always so friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite poke place in Vegas. We use the perka app and earn free burritos or bowls, since we frequent so often. Love the selection. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This new poke place is near my house. So I decided to give it a try since I love sushi. I ordered a salmon and yellowtail bowl. Surprisingly the amount that they give me is pretty decent size and the best part is that it comes with a seaweed salad. No extra charge!! The freshness of the fish is pretty decent compared to other poke places that I tried. The area is very easy to find and inside the restaurant it's very nice and quiet. Definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"Im mad that we didn't find this place sooner.   Was craving poke so we went to Yelp.  We ordered two combo Poke Bowl and Ramens.  Soooooo good!  We did tue build your own bowl and both of us were 100% satisfied with our choice.  We couldn't decide on a sauce so they let us try a couple.  We went with creamy ceviche and the garlic ponzu.   The ramen wasn't good unfortunately.  Im fairly positive they use bouillon and instant noodles.  Not worth it.   Yes than the ramen I love this place. Ive been telling everyone to come here and have been back at least 5 times in the last month."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered this place right by my work! I moved to Vegas for about a year and haven't been able to find a poke place that I liked. This place has really friendly customer service as well as **BOMB** poke. I am a salmon lover and their fish selection was pretty fresh! I really liked the variety in their add on selections as well. Glad to add this to my places to eat for lunch list"}
{"text":"Poke here was really good! Customer service was just okay though. The price was decent for the amount of food you get. When it comes to the Northwest side of town this is definitely one of the best poke spots I've been to thus far."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back again and again. Staff was nothing but smiles (always a plus) and answered all the tiny questions I had about sauces and what's popular. Our meal was super refreshing after being outside in this Vegas summer. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My second time here. I prefer it from the place up the street. Their fish quality is great. They have tuna and spicy tuna, every sauce you can name & sides that you would traditionally have with your sushi. I typically get their 808 bowl as it is my fav and replace tuna with 3 spicy tuna scoops, which apparently you can do! Indoor eating area is generally really clean. They even have fun drinks and traditional sweets to purchase on the side. My bow average with drink has been $13. Not terrible for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Decided to take the girlfriend and try this place, first impressions as you walk through the door it looks new and cool, but it full on smells like a fish market and I think they need to figure out how to fix this , I don't know how other sushi joints mask the fish smell but I think they need to learn, it was slightly unappealing. I quickly made the executive decision we would take it to go as I wasn't sure I could handle the smell while eating.  The ordering process took longer than I would have liked but I think this might be due to dumb customers infront of us, I felt like yelling shut up asking questions and just fuckin order, but maybe with time the staff will get better at pushing these customers along the process.   The options are endless but basically you can get a bowl or a big ass sushi roll ( burrito). I got the bowl and the gf went with the burrito. On my bowl was rice, ahi tuna, spicy tuna , those little orange egg things , onion,  yum yum sauce, and eil sauce.   It was amazing,  the fish taste so fresh and delicious. I see myself being a regular. I think next time I might add some more to my bowl but I was completely happy with my order.   I think with time the process and slight problems will get fixed. Can't wait to see what this place grows in to."}
{"text":"Love this place. So good and everyone's customer service is amazing. Especially Chase. He told me about their points system. Great service Chase."}
{"text":"Great for unlv students who love poke at an affordable price. With your student Id you get a discount and for some delicious poke a good amount!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Tuna Poké. So when this place popped up I knew it would be a good addition to Centennial Hills. My favs are the Salmon, Tuna, and Spicy Tuna. Ive tried the Unagi (eel) but usually stick to my favorites. My fish is usually accompanied by brown rice, spicy ginger sauce, avocado, seaweed, cucumber, ginger and my new addition lettuce. Surprisingly the bowl is extremely good with lettuce for all of you out there trying to be healthy as I am.  The taro chips are also delish!"}
{"text":"After a couple of months of trying other various poke restaurants around Vegas, I have come to the conclusion that this is my favorite place! I really appreciate the fact that they have a large variety of protein/sauce/toppings for no additional charge, I like that they have various bowl sizes, I like that the portions are generous, I like the punch card system, I like that the service is really fast, and that it happens to be the closest to my house. Out of the many, many times I have gone to this place, I have never been disappointed, and I hope I never will be!"}
{"text":"I've made it a personal mission to visit every Poke Bowl joint in the SE Vegas / Henderson area. This, by far, is my favorite! They are clean, have plenty of options, and are staffed by super people (Aaron is my favorite. He \"gets\" my masago addiction and always has a cheery disposition). They are generous with portions and don't nickel and dime you with added charges for things like corn or extra sauces.   I typically get the 3-scoop bowl with half spring greens and half brown rice. Rounded off with a drink and miso, and I get two full meals for under $20.   The single thing I've found at another place that I wish they had here is quinoa. Other than that, this place has it all. Definitely addictive."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this chain when I stumbled upon it up in Henderson. When I found out that there was one right up the road from my home, I was excited, until I found out they have been closed due to a kitchen fire. I spent the next three months pressing my nose longingly against the windows until they finally reopened. Now they see me at least once a week. The staff is amazing, they always treat me with respect and remember me, usually by name. I love getting the large bowl with a very generous amount of fresh sushi and lots of veggies. Plus, they understand my masago addiction and are generous with that,  too. It's nice that they have brown rice as an option, I wish that they had quinoa. Literally my favorite place to come for lunch and usually I end up with dinner left over.  My husband loves their burritoes, his favorite is the Seattle. He swears it has nothing to do with that being where we came from.   As much as I love sushi, I find it hard to go back to rolls and sashimi when I can build a bowl with all my favorite goodies and sauces here for half the price."}
{"text":"First time here and we don't regret it. We're from an island where we eat fresh tuna almost everyday and for being in the US for a week now, we really missed tuna. We found out this place while shopping aroung. We ordered the Aloha bowl which was just EXCELLENT and a Ramen Soup with Tonkotsu broth which was a little bit too salty, but good anyway."}
{"text":"I went in Monday night for the first time and Grace was so helpful! I also really enjoyed the food. It was overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This poke bowl was so delicious. I was craving sushi but needed something quick so when I drove by it seemed perfect. The inside is super cute with a little fridge area with all sorts of goodies, including macarons. Yum! The ordering line is set up like a Chipotle, you start with a base, then the fish, sauce, and then all the toppings. I honestly can't remember what I ordered but what I do remember is thinking \"holy crap this bowl is huge, it's probably gonna cost me a pretty penny!\" But no, it was less than $10. I was shocked and even better, it was delicious! This is the best poke bowl I've ever had and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So sad to give this place 1 star but unfortunately after calling twice about a mobile order to make sure it was correct, it was still not correct. As an employee, it is your job to make sure orders are right. If you can't do that, don't work in the restaurant business that's all I will say. Don't place mobile orders to sweet poke. Just go in person if you want to have your food how you pay for it."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl from the very friendly staff. It was my first visit and they were very helpful. I ordered the 808 bowl which included tuna & spicy tuna with rice and all the fresh toppings I wanted. The sauce was delicious. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and it is very clean."}
{"text":"Meh!  Three generous stars for the spicy house sauce! Beyond the sauce Sweet Poke sushi burrito is super basic and under-developed (small). The restaurant is very compact especially for the amount of traffic they generate so I ended up eating in my car while driving back to work. The overall experience is comparable to your typical poke joint. A buffet of selections for $10+ bucks!"}
{"text":"Of all the new Poké places in town, this one is the best. They give an option for a tofu base, which gives great value. All the add-ins are fresh and the sauce choices are diverse. The food is naturally good, and the restaurant doesn't feel pretentious. Simple, easy, great food."}
{"text":"Had the samba and salmon shaka burrito. It tasted surprisingly better than i expected, to be honest! The salmon was fresh too. Which is rare to find now and days. Both burritos were absolutely delicious. But i noticed that all the employers there were very slow with making the burritos. They all needed a cheat sheet to know what ingredients to add into the roll.  But i understand, since this is a new place that recently opened. So of course it would take them time to memorize the whole menu. Still, the food was excellent.   Additionally, Employers should smile more. Act friendlier.  Improve their interpersonal skills. Although they were kind, majority of the time they had a straight face. Not a crack of smile anywhere."}
{"text":"So the food is good, but the service I got that night wasn't. I am not sure if it was a shift change or what was happening but. But for there to be hecka people an get so little service is beyond me. It was the first time I had ever been there and there was no  direction on anything. Lucky my coworker told me the process of how it worked.  Customer service was lacking, which was really odd because there was hecka employees in there. So my burrito is done being made and the guy that is suppose to wrap it like goes in the back and comes all the way around to the front to pick up a tray and then goes back into the back, (all the while my burrito is still sitting there unwrapped) then the same guy comes back to wrap my burrito, luckily he changed gloves to do so otherwise I would have had a huge fit! So finally my burrito is wrapped my sauce is next to it, cool. Then the lady in front of me that was paying for her food was like oh can I get some Chipotle sauce and the cashier proceeds to take the one that was next to my burrito, which was meant for me. Me not saying anything, I was like okay I'll just have to get another one. So just as I go to pay the guy that was checking people out goes to the back and like doesn't come back. So at this point I'm like what that heck is happening am I invisible does my order not matter right now......so I wait like what feels like forever for someone to ring me up, all the while there is like hella employees in the front that could have rung me up or at least been like tell someone \"hey can someone come and ring her up.' oh and mind you it wasn't busy, there were more employees in that place than there were people. Then finally someone comes from the back a totally different dude to ring me up. I'm like cool I can get out of here. Then he gon have the nerve to be like oh would you like to leave a tip!!!!!!!! UMMM hell naw I shall pass! I have been waiting for like 5 plus minutes just to be rung up! my food been ready, if it were hot it would have been cold by now. Then he proceeds to tell me about there rewards program. I kid you not he says, \"so you can sign up with our rewards program by using this receipt.\" so I ask for him to elaborate and dude just looks at me and I'm like okay I'm done, never mind let me take my burrito and get up out of here.   So it gets 3 stars only because the food is good. but the service is lack luster!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, staff was nice. Good taste good, little pricey IMO. But I'd recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, reasonable prices, fast service and amazing food ( got the 808 Poke Bowl). So happy there's a quality poke place like this one here in LV! Will be back with my friends!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever get out to this part of the valley. So when I spotted Sweet Poke I knew I'd found my lunch spot. It's set-up just like a Chipotle. You can make your own bowl or sushi burrito. They have preset rolls and bowls, but I love making my own!  I decided on a regular bowl with white rice. The regular is a huge portion, but they have a large as well if you are super hungry. It's great that they offer brown or white rice. After that it's all you! Select your protein. I ordered raw salmon, ahi tuna and spicy tuna. Next, you choose a sauce or sauces as many as you like. I had the chipotle mayo and I wanted the house sweet poke sauce (they were out) so I ended up with yum yum sauce instead. Then toppings! They have a ton! I loved that they give you avocado free on your bowl. I had that with cucumber, mango pieces, and red onion. Now, they do charge extra for mango salsa so I improvised.  Sweet Poke has great raw fish. The amount of fish to rice could be slightly better, but overall it was very satisfying. The sauces I ended up with were excellent, but their chipotle mayo needs a little kick.  If I'm in that neck of the woods again I'd definitely give them a try again."}
{"text":"I've been to the sweet poke at the centennial hills location and really enjoy their bowls. The sweet Maryland location I feel is even better. They give you a student discount, and is more generous with the toppings.  I try to be healthy so I always get my bowl with half tofu half spinach. The combo is delicious because the poke sauce coats it and it feels so much lighter than eating rice. The sauce combo I do is the spicy mayo, sesame shoyu, and spicy garlic ponzu. I like the sweet and spicy balance.   The workers there are nice and are generous with the toppings. I load mine with tons of veggies including avocado, cucumbers, bell peppers and seaweed salad. Also try adding fried onion or garlic chips to your bowl. Adds great flavor and texture!  They also have a bonus reward program. If you buy 10 bowls or burritos you get one free!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend as a pit stop after Costco and I'm so glad I did.  I love this poke place!  First off I feel like the price is very reasonable here.  2 scoops of protein for less than 10 dollars!  Also, I love that they give you more options than other places for the base.  The options include white, brown rice, salad (spring mix, romaine, spinach or kale), tofu or a combination of the above.  I picked spinach salad with tofu.  They also offer a variety of sauces and I went with the popular chipotle mayo and eel sauce.  A nice balance of spicy and sweet.  Their salmon and tuna were very fresh.  I didn't get any chewy pieces or fishy tasting pieces in my bowl.  On top of your two scoops, they also offer a complimentary scoop of spicy or regular crab meat, or spicy tuna.  I went with the spicy tuna and that was delicious as well.  I also love that avocado comes free!  Usually they charge extra for that.  I topped my bowl with tons of veggies including seaweed salad, corn, peppers, radish, edamame etc.  Everything was delicious and will definitely come here again.  I recommend you creating your own bowl rather than picking a bowl off their menu because you can tailor it just to how you like it."}
{"text":"I am bound and determined to like a sushi burrito! I tried another place and got a little to adventurous with it and hated it! A friend told me about this place so I had to try it! When I walked in everyone was friendly and helpful I don't them I just wanted a basic California roll burrito to start off! It was really good! I'm glad I made myself try a sushi burrito again:)"}
{"text":"The best poke place in town!!! I am so addicted to the bowls, they are made fresh with the most amazing topping & fresh fish. Their choices are excellent, sauces are great as well. I can't say enough about how good this he food is here. The service is always fast and friendly also. Sweet Poke is my go to spot every week for my fav meal!!!! Try them out!!!"}
{"text":"Best Poke Bowl place in town!!! I am so addicted to it I come 2x a week every week. There are so many great choices and I get many of them to make my Bowl mouthwatering and delish!!!!The fish & shrimp is fresh and the sauce choices are awesome. The Bowl are filling and you definitely won't go hungry. I can't say enough about how great this place is, keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to find a poke bowl / sushi burrito spot pop up in the neighborhood.   I stop in on their 4th day being open and make my own bowl. I got a  2 scoop bowl with yellowtail to go. On this first impression it was awful. The rice was hot. I had to put it in the fridge because the fish was then warm and I can't eat it that way. It tasted fine but of course having hot rice changed the fish as the side touching the rice turned a bit white and cooked lightly. Some of my greens wilted.  The fish scoops was miniscule. The cubes don't fit perfectly into the scoop so you'll have gaps and the girl I saw level the scoop so my \"large\" bowl had a total of 8 little pieces which is uber stingy. I got the salsa for $1 extra which they convinced me was so bomb but was not worth the up charge . $12 and was sorely disappointed by portion and attention to detail.   I started to see friends go there recently and saw their bowls looked more generous so I decided to try again. This time around aside from my 2 scoops of fish (I got yellowtail and tuna), I was offered a scoop of another protein either spicy tuna, surimi crab or lobster mix which is included in the bowl price. I was not offered that during my first visit, they forgot somehow which is amazing as you see the bowl in front of you and I'm the only customer being helped or this is a new thing they added into their bowls. This makes the protein ratio a bit better. The fish seem decent quality this time around and the rice was room temperature instead of hot. I also noticed a few things that cost extra at others, can come in your bowl like avocado, masago, etc. BUT they aren't generous in portions here- it's pretty precise in topppings.   Its not my favorite but now it isn't terrible like the first experience so I will probably visit for convenience."}
{"text":"First Review yay! This place is great! I've been waiting for this place to open since it's so close to my house. I went with a create your own bowl. Fish was fresh and the space was clean and open."}
{"text":"First time there.  Kind staffer helped me out with sauces and toppings!   I got a medium salad which came with 3 scoops of protein for $12.04 with tax.  It was more than enough food for two meals.  I chose crab for step 1 (which she said was real), and then for step 2: 1 scoop of tuna, and 2 scoops of salmon.  I added the Hawaiian sauce mix which was delicious!!  I didn't have to wait in a long line and got more raw fish than I could have at a sushi restaurant.  Win!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite poke spot in town! Convenient location in SW if you're coming from either the 215 or Blue Diamond and the food is always really fresh. The employees are really patient with questions and they always give excellent sauce combination recommendations and make sure you get exactly what you want when you order custom items. The upcharge items are clearly labeled which makes ordering a breeze. I like their punchcard app that earns you a free bowl for every ten purchased- very easy to use. Shout out to employee Christian who made me the best bowl on 2/12!"}
{"text":"Nice clean and very friendly place to be served and experience what they offer. Was greeted once we entered as well being a first timer the staff mentioned a few of their favorite mixes to make it an easier decision. Will gladly be back here again!"}
{"text":"I usually come here when I feel like I want to eat \"healthy\" and still have my rice!! I can always add certain topping on my poke bowl without extra cost. Also the people are very inviting when you enter.. They Greet you! Which is one thing that I look for when I try a new resto.   Im sure to become a regular soon. If you have the Perka app, you can earn points for free stuff! try to install app before you pay your food! :)"}
{"text":"Wow! A sushi burrito? I ordered the Ahi Lover and my wife ordered the Cancun. We both loved it! We live the NW so we still need to try the location by us. This reminds me of an Asian chipotle in that the food is prepared in front of you. We also got 1 drink to share as well as 1 order of miso soup. It was like $21.00. You also have the option of having your meal in a bowl instead of wrapped. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious, friendly and easy!  Lots of choices and very decently priced. I always make my own but you can order a preset bowl or burrito and when you do they always check to make sure you want each item just in case. I feel like prices here are VERY competitive for what you get and I've never left feeling that anyone was skimping on any of the proteins. I like how the spicy tuna is considered a topping so you can get two scoops of fish + spicy tuna and still be a regular bowl. If there is a line it moves very fast.  Entering and exiting parking lot can get a little crowded/ busy/ testy but there always is parking fairly close in the large parking lot."}
{"text":"They  have finally opened one by UNLV! I must say I was super excited to learn they would have one on that side of town, knowing I can now get my fix before or after class. Not to mention they have a drive thru!!! A drive thru Poke joint, can't say I've seen that before but I sure am happy they have it!!"}
{"text":"I drive all over town for work and make pit stops at all the new Poke spots when I can. I've been to their other locations and have never been disappointed.   New location but same great fresh food and awesome customer service. The hamachi bowl is my favorite by far.   They are definitely my fav poke shop around!"}
{"text":"For being open for a few days they got my food right! Im picky about my ingredients sometimes, so when i saw them freshly cutting everything i was happy. Delicious food, good price!!!"}
{"text":"Good poke bowl, everything fresh, charges for mango salsa and avocado ($1 each). Friendly staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sweet Poké!!! I've tried a couple other poke places around town, but this one is definitely my favorite. Everything about it, is great!  They have a great menu selection, including diy bowls and burritos, for great prices. Good protein, fruit, and vegetable options, some even change with the seasons. They recently started doing ramen, which I was unsure of, at first. I decided to try it one day and it was so yum!  I usually get a regular size bowl, as a combo with miso soup & a drink. I start with half brown rice, half spinach. Two scoops of salmon with yum yum and eel sauce. Then I do my add-ins: spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, tofu, corn, mango, pineapple, ginger, red bell pepper, with crunch sprinkled on top.   What's even better is that they don't charge extra for avocado and they have a rewards system & app. Bomb!"}
{"text":"This is probably not my first choice for sushi burritos. The staff was amazing and super friendly. The worker really helped me get the most for my money! However I think I had a hard time just because every bite made my burrito unroll and the seaweed paper was not breaking, it was stringy and unbitable. Their ramen smelled amazing and their selection of toppings, proteins, and miscellaneous add ins was top notch. I ended up only eating half of my burrito just because it was so difficult to bite and keep together."}
{"text":"Awesome service, thumbs up to Shirlene!  And great food! Definitely fulfilling. I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to be wowed and enjoy this place since its not too far off from my house but I left there disappointed. Ill give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened and had workers there that were still training. Just a fair warning, dont expect the quality and prep to be nice and clean like sushiritto or jabburrito.  I ordered a spicy ahi tuna roll and another one with salmon (forgot the name). But while they were making my spicy ahi roll they tell me that they ran out already and asked if I just wanted regular ahi but with spicy crab mix. I didn't mind but I wished they told me beforehand so I could've picked something else.  Then they were making my salmon roll. I noticed the girl working there was a little confused on what goes into which burrito because she was making my rolls simultaneously. In the end they both tasted the same.  Service was nice though and restaurant was clean and has free WiFi. Hopefully when I come back they'll be able to serve their dishes right."}
{"text":"My goodness this was one of the most awkward experiences I had. Walking in one of the employees is yelling at a customer asking her all loud very sarcastic if she wants masago which I think some people may not know what that is if it's their first time it's smelt egg the little orange eggs that pop in your mouth which I love BTW.young teen age kid acting very rude and I think they need a lot of work in the training department. Luckily for us we didn't get that dude to help us. I ordered the dragon in burrito form and Yuuuucccccckkkkkk!!  the eel still had the bones in it so gross and undercooked. I don't usually bash on food places like this but I think this hype is fake. You can't fool a sushi lover like me trust me I'm a pro in this department although our guy serving us was very polite and everything I think they just need to hire better workers that can make this place shine."}
{"text":"This is a great Poké restaurant, the food is delicious and the employee's are all super friendly. Everything we had was amazing and you choose what base you want from rivet to salad to tofu! It is a must to add to your list."}
{"text":"Right now this is my go to poke bowl spot. With their being so many of these in town now you must be really good for me to be a return customer. The staff is super friendly and you can use the perka app for a free regular bowl after 10. The protein is really high quality and for just under 11 bucks, you get two scoops of protein and a nice add on as well such as spicy crab. You can also mix and match your own sauce which is great. They also have a lot of selection when it comes to the sides. Overall great poke spot, its fairly addictive and i get a craving for it about once a week or more. Great stuff near perfect 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I've been 3 days in a row. I wish I found this place sooner!! It is AMAZING. My favorite is the Shrimp Lover!"}
{"text":"To keep it short and to keep myself from ranting: - Portions were good BUT - No atmosphere: plain white walls, a few crappy chairs and tables, no one greets you when you walk in - Staff are all new and painfully unaware of how anything works or menu - Chef who was training the kid was condescending towards the poor kid the whole time he made my roll - Kid tried to cut my roll with a dirty knife  - Roll wasn't rolled up very well and fell apart when I opened it  In conclusion: I am all for small businesses but to see the chef treat the way he treated his staff, especially in front of customers, I can't imagine how he treats them when there are no customers. I rather go down the street and help out SOHO."}
{"text":"Definitely give this place a try!  Fresh, tasty and filling!!  Friendly and they offer suggestions which is nice for the first timer.   They did run out of Ahi Tuna and Scallops,  but they're new and need  time to gauge their crowds, so be prepared to change your mind, but it will be worth it!!!  3 more locations coming in the city.   Come in!"}
{"text":"Came into the store and was kindly welcomed, the staff was very courteous and helpful. Ordered the Aloha bowl and everything tasted super bomb, the extra free toppings were just icing on the cake. Great place! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten progressively better since opening. I go here semi regularly and for the most part am satisfied every time I do. With they had a small or half burrito lunch special"}
{"text":"This restaurant has very positive and helpful employees as well as a nice, modern atmosphere. The food itself tasted amazing and it just felt fresh, healthy, and most if all, delicious. We'll  definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Incredible!  The freshest ingredients,so tasty. Very clean dining room. Will definitely go back. I can't wait for them to come to Reno."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Poke Place!  My boyfriend and I come at least once a week.   Very clean, the staff is nice.  We normally stop by anywhere between 7-9pm. There's never a line, and we're normally the only ones in there. We've never dined in (normally because they are about to close). The food holds up on the drive home, always fresh.   They use Perka as their rewards, every 10 bowls/burritos you received a regular bowl free! Who can beat that?   I highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Sweet \"Sweet Poké\" how much I love you!!!! This place is an orgasm in your mouth. My boyfriend and I come here probably every two weeks. Today I got a regular bowl.   The contents were: Tofu  Furikake Salmon & Shrimp w/ sauces Sweet Poke House Sauce & Creamy Jalapeño (they say house sauce is spicy but I don't think so at all) Topping: Spicy Crab Additional Toppings: Masago Green Onion Red Onion Seaweed Spinach Corn Tempura Crunch Avocado  Fried Onions  Fried Garlic Mango Salsa ($1 extra but so worth it) Side of Spicy Garlic Ponzu  This place so deserves 5 stars. I've been here about 10 times and been waiting to write a review to see how all my experiences were and they've all been great. The food always tastes so fresh. The establishment is clean. The people that work there are great in customer service. They give you decent sized portions in protein and toppings. It's great for a $10.50 meal with the freshest ingredients, not to mention it's super healthy. There's only one upset and the one time we did eat in the place was so hot. So my bf and I don't really do that anymore. But we love this place. Definitely don't mind picking it up and taking it home. 5 stars Sweet Poké!!! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 10 stars!  Food is incredible, especially for the price.  Management and staff are excellent--fast, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Sweet Poke is now in my restaurant rotation a couple times a week!"}
{"text":"This place has now become one of my favorite post-workout spots. Good selections of protein and veggies, quick and convenient, and the service is great. They seem to remember us every time we come here (which is a lot).   Their combinations can either be a bowl or a burrito. My favorite combo is Shaka Surf...and pretty much anything with salmon. You can also create your own combo. Pick a base (white rice, brown rice, salad, or tofu). Pick your protein (salmon, tuna, soft-shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, etc.). Pick your sauce (wasabi aioli, yuzu, shoyu, ginger, yum yum sauce, eel sauce, etc.). Pick other toppings (green onions, masago, tamago, mango, mango salsa, cilantro, cucumber, furikake, strawberry, edamame, wakame, avocado, spinach, lettuce, etc.)  My favorite custom combination would be tofu, salmon, spicy tuna, soft-shell crab, shoyu, mango, cilantro, green onions, furikake and masago. Depending on my mood, I add more stuff to my combo. You can reuse the bowls for meal prepping.  They have bottled beverages (melon soda, green tea, jasmine green tea, milk tea) and fountain drinks. There's a cooler by the fridge with pre-packaged poke and desserts such as macarons, cheesecake and cake rolls."}
{"text":"So I went back for the sushi burrito and it did not disappoint!   I made my own order with salmon and soft shell crab.  It was full of flavor and so yummy  Still don't like the toppings priced individually, but whatevs.   This time no run ins with the executive chef.   You can be an amazing chef and all, but being a little rude and pushy with customers isn't really cool.     Staff should take more time to go down the line or answer any of the customers questions.   Especially when there's no one else in the place.     So much competition in this poke/sushi game nowadays, customer service is really what keeps customers.  Just saying."}
{"text":"A friend and I stumbled upon this poke place due to its location. It is conveniently located directly across the street from the UNLV Student Union and in the same shopping center as the Chewy Boba Company. Prior to studying at the library last semester, we would come here weekly to pick up a poke bowl as \"brain fuel\". Due to a kitchen fire, this location was closed for a number of months; however, when we found out about their re-opening, it was like Christmas morning!   The customer service here is superb. Upon walking in, each individual has a smile and is ready to offer help. Two indecisive girls and the idea of building a poke bowl is not the best combination; however, everyone always offers recommendations that result in great tastes every single time.   I have had bad experience with the fish at other poke restaurants; however, the fish and vegetable here are consistently fresh. I usually do half salad and half rice with the proteins of tuna (fresh caught ahi) and yellowtail. The Chipotle Mayo is always a solid, along with the Sweet Poke House Sauce (if you like spicy things). In addition, you get to a choose a topping. My friend and I agreed that the spicy crab is definitely the way to go. You also have the choice to choose additional toppings. I always go with seaweed, edamame, cucumber, and tempura crunch (which all come at no additional cost).  To make it even better, there's a discount if you have your student ID card, a rewards program, AND you can order online if you wish.  Definitely a 5/5 in my books!"}
{"text":"I use to work super close to this location and would come 2-3 times a week for lunch. So yummy and the portions are just right. Come here to get your sushi/Poké fix! You won't regret it! Nice modern decor and fresh fish!"}
{"text":"This is the closest poke place to my home so figured we would give it a shot. Why everyone rates it 5 stars I have no clue, maybe they haven't had any better?!  The fish isn't the greatest cut and it's overpriced. If you are a poke addict or know your fish don't go here. If you are just getting in the game you will probably like it."}
{"text":"This place has been hiding in my bookmarks forever! Hubby & I decided to go somewhere new for dinner, luckily choosing Sweet Poké. It's so fresh and tasty. Nothing to mention, close to our home too.  We each built our own bowl, mine with white rice, salmon, crab, seaweed salad, cucumber, avocado, corn and mixed greens. I'd take advantage of their toppings; they're unlimited after all! Next time I'll add mango and tempura crunch. Hubby put mango in his, and it complimented the poké so well!  The sauces are made in-house too which adds to the whole freshness element. I asked for the Sweet Poké House Sauce, but there was nothing sweet about it. It was pretty spicy, which I was warned about. I assumed the name meant it would be somewhat sweet. Rule of thumb: Never assume! Lol, I'll stick to the Yum Yum sauce in the future.  Price points are also notably less than other poké spots, as if you needed another reason to come here!"}
{"text":"It's a nice concept that's popping up everywhere. Choose your protein, carbs and sides and sauces. The poke tasted fresh and you have a variety of choices of sauces and topping. The amount of food given was just satisfying not a huge amount or a tiny portion but enough to keep you satisfied for a while.   The price was ok for the amount of food since it is tuna. A got a regular tuna poke bowl and a bottle of jasmine green tea. It came out to be about $15 a little pricey which I think it was the bottled green tea that was pricey. The food tasted good."}
{"text":"It was my first time having anything like this because I'm not a sushi person, but I found out it's not all sushi. Josh who works the night shift was very informative on what I should order. He was very knowledgeable about the food they serve and offered several suggestions. I decided to go with the salad bowl. I had it with shrimp tempura. They had a spicy mayo sauce that gave a lot of flavor. I would definitely go back.  The entire staff looked happy to be at work."}
{"text":"OK...I knew when this place opened that my family would be checking it out..but I had no idea my daughter and husband would come here 3 times a week minimal.... Lynn is our favorite person working there...she is so good that she remembers our order every time....!!! Love this place ,,Love Lynn!!"}
{"text":"Before going to Las Vegas I did my research on places I wanted to eat and this was one of them, and I have to say I'm so happy we got to enjoy this place! I got the dragon burrito in a soy wrapper- it was absolutely amazing, and my husband got some kind of chicken bowl with dumplings (he didn't wanna get any raw sushi since we were gonna take left overs on the road). No issues with parking. I just wish we had a place like this on the east coast."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice, to give it a second chance before writing this review. I was so excited to see the Centennial area get a place that serves poke and sushi burritos. I'll admit both of my kids liked their burritos, albeit one only tried a burrito with surimi crab and cucumbers inside. I went alone my first visit, and ordered a make your own bowl. I got yellowtail, salmon, soft shell crab, spicy tuna, and surimi with cucumbers. I had to pay extra since the rules for \"make your on\" don't allow for spicy tuna and surimi in the same bowl. The sauce I chose was the chipotle mayo. The employee making my bowl was friendly, asking if I'd been there before. I advised him I hadn't. He ran through a short explanation of the menu. I chose to make my own bowl since I really didn't see a combination I liked. I chose the yellowtail and salmon first. He asked for the sauce choice, then mixed the sauce and fish with masago before placing it on the rice. I added the other ingredients and proceed to pay the $12.44 for my bowl. Ouch. I order all kinds of bowls from soho sushi burrito and have never paid that much. As for the taste, bleh, the fish was mushy and slimy. The pieces weren't completely chopped well and some of the salmon pieces came out like a string, with connective tissue. The spicy tuna was inedible. It was more like a mushy paste. The soft shell crab was hard and stale. It tasted like it had been fried days before. At the time, the place was still new and had only one other customer in the dining area when I visited. I rationalized that the lack of freshness was attributed to the fact that they didn't cycle through enough food to prepare it fresh. A few weeks had passed and after a visit to the eyebrow threading salon in the same strip mall, my kids convinced me to try it again. This time it was packed. We waited behind a small group of teenage boys that were ordering and apparently knew the young blonde employee making the burritos. My oldest ordered a dragon burrito, the youngest ordered a burrito with surimi and cucumbers (she's the picky one). The same young blonde started my order by just scooping the salmon on the rice. I asked if she could mix it with the sauce, but she didn't hear me as she was still flirting with the teens in front of us. I watched as she picked up the squirt bottle and covered the fish and rice with the mayo. Oh well. I ordered the surimi and tempura shrimp to go with the salmon. At the checkout we were enticed to order a combo which came with either chips or edamame and a soda. We chose the edamame. The bill came to around $45. I asked what the cucumber surimi roll costed and he it was $8.99. I said \"really you don't have a kids burrito?\" He was nice and said \"oh okay since there are only 2 ingredients I'll take $3 off. Sweet, only $42. My kids were eating their burritos by the time I got my soda and came back to the table. They both said theirs were good. I took one bite of my rice with some salmon and the rice was hard. I took another bite from a different section of the bowl and still it was hard. I took my bowl back up to the checkout and asked the cashier if I could switch out the rice, as it was either undercooked or had dried out in the warmer. He was very polite and apologized. He went to the line where the rice warmer was, and took some out and placed it in a bowl. He went to the back and after a few short minutes came back to me and stated, you're right, the rice was undercooked. He offered to make me a burrito instead since they had to cook more rice to make the bowls with. I agreed that would be fine. He scooped my toppings onto a burrito wrapper, rolled it up and handed it back with an apology. The burrito was petty good.the tempura shrimp tasted fresh and the salmon wasn't stringy like before. I still would drive all the way to Sahara to get a soho sushi burrito before I'd visit this place ever again. The prices are better and their employees are always professional and courteous. If you do decide to try this place, I recommend ordering a burrito!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too amazed with Sweet Poke the first time I came and tried to avoid it at all cost, especially when there are three other poke places around me. I decided to give it another try since I was really craving and this was the closest to my work. They definitely redeemed themselves.   I'm impressed with the amount of protein they give you. The person helping me was very helpful with suggestions. I got a bowl with rice, two scoops of protein (ahi tuna & salmon), and unlimited toppings -- of course there's an extra charge for cream cheese, avocado, tamago, and some others. The guy hooked me up with an extra slice of tamago though (thank you!).   I brought my coworkers with me and they loved the place. I guess we'll be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Very nice shop with friendly helpful employees. The Poke has fresh ingredients and several choices of sauces & fish. They do skimp in the amount of fish you get by adding lots of ingredients but the finished product is very good and very filling.  It seems that poke salad stores are popping up everywhere offering a mainland version of poke. Lots & lots of ingredients and some fish."}
{"text":"I was slightly oddly skeptical of the poke bowl/ sushi burrito trend. Seeing that I love sushi and raw ahi in any form, I was clearly being stupid. Today I realized that I've been depriving myself of some amazingly delicious meals. The fish selection at Sweet Poké was great and all the options visually looked super fresh and well cut. The toppings were all full and fresh looking and the staff was great getting the lunch crowd through the line.   My bowl was fantastic and I would love to try the spicy crab and a different sauce option next time to compare against my original bowl. I would highly recommend this place and if you are on the fence about sushi burritos or bowls, don't be."}
{"text":"Ok so today was my first time at Sweet Poké. I'll start by saying I love rice and I love vegetables and I love them all partying together in the same bowl. So it's safe to say they have the bases covered so far.   I chose white rice, veggies and tofu. Then you can customize your bowl with the choice of several toppings. I added mango, onion, cucumber, seaweed and dressed it with spicy ginger shoyu. I was there right at opening so the rice was hot and fresh. The veggies were perfectly cold, crisp and tasty also.    The dining room tables could've used some love with a strong wipe down and the utensil dispensers could really use a cleaning.   The service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing selection and super fresh! Such a cute spot to have a healthy meal at. Boba tea just across the plaza too"}
{"text":"I had the dragon burrito and it was fantastic. The staff were all polite, professional, and very helpful. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Had the samba role. With crab, shrimp tempura, salmon, avocado! Will for sure come back for more. They ingredients are all fresh. Staff super nice and fast at making the sushirittos!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: clean and interior looks cleaned it has white walls so it looks spacious with 6 tables and a bench.  Service: pretty good, they know their stuff and the taste of the sauce used to mix. One thing tho, when the girl that served me ran out of tuna she got new ones and mixed a few pieces of old ones to the new batch. That cross contaminates the whole thing so just a heads up so just need to change that habit."}
{"text":"Very Interesting concept, Build your own sushi burrito ingredients are fresh, prices are good, avacado is not extra!"}
{"text":"I've never tried a sushi burrito until I came to this place. They have a wide variety of fish ranging from ahi tuna all the way to tako (octopus). I love the idea of being able to put what I want in my own burrito or bowl. The food is amazing and I will definitely be coming back here to eat again."}
{"text":"First just let me say that I love this place. The combinations on poke bowls that you can get is limited to your imagination and bravery.   This was the first time I've eaten here and I wasn't sure on how things worked. Basically you can create your own or pick one of the ones that Sweet poke has created. I chose to make my own. So I picked salad as the base with 2 scoop salmon and 1 tuna with chipotle mayo. They put it into a bowl and mixed it all up then put it into my bowl then they added the spicy tuna on top. For the toppings I went a little conservative because I thought you could only pick 2 or 3 things ( my fault for not asking) but you can just pick whatever. They have so many options that this place will not get old for me.   The restaurant is nice and clean and had a nice feel to it. I wish it had a little more seating but there are also tables outside which would be nice to use once the weather gets cooler."}
{"text":"Do you like subway? Do you like chipotle? Do you like seafood? Then this is the place for you (Kind of)! The ordering experience is reminiscent of creating your own subway sandwich or chipotle burrito except now you're creating a poke burrito or a poke bowl (BOWL, not BALL, for all you Pokemon fans). I personally recommend creating your own bowl but I have yet to try the burrito. I do plan to come back and try the sushi burrito soon and if it's anything like the bowl it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"So I'm not usually a fan of seafood but I was hungry and found this place through Yelp. I ordered the poke bowl and customized it to make it spicy and was very pleased with the result. The staff was very patient as they even remade my bowl after I decided I wanted shrimp instead of salmon as my protein. I will admit that the some of the staff seem a bit inexperienced but that's to be expected with new hires and the management seems capable enough to keep the place running smoothly."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus! Sweet Poké has so many toppings- mango, masago, avocado, and more! With poké bowls so delicious, I could eat here every damn day. Here, you move left to right as you choose a base, protein(s) from 9 choices, sauce (a dozen choices), then toppings. Their seafood and ingredients look and taste super fresh, but their soft shell crab was a little cold and not as crunchy as I had hoped. A regular poké bowl has 2 scoops of protein ($9.50) while a large has 3 ($11.99). Service was awesome and all smiles- I was getting sauce for my toddler's poké bowl and didn't want it spicy so they let me taste a couple of their non-spicy sauces.  For drinks, they offer bottled water, tea, soda, and juices. Under their \"Sides\" menu, their bag of super thin and crunchy Taro Chips with a creamy sauce that had just a hint of wasabi for $2 was just killer. GET THIS! They also offer a $12.50 meal deal which includes any regular bowl or sushi burrito, a soda, and either edamame, miso soup, taro, chips, or seaweed salad. In addition, they have legit kid's meals including apple juice for $6.99. Since their website kinda sucks right now, here are their choices for poké bowls and sushi burritos (seaweed or soy paper):  BASES: white rice, chips, brown rice, salad, organic tofu, half-half  PROTEINS: Ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon, cooked salmon, soft shell crab, scallop, shrimp, unagi (freshwater eel), tako (octopus)  SAUCES: Chipotle mayo, eel sauce, wasabi aioli, spicy ginger shoyu, wasabi yuzu, sweet poké house sauce, creamy jalapeño, yum yum sauce, creamy ceviche, anticucho shoyu, sesame shoyu, spicy garlic ponzu  TOPPINGS: crab, spicy crab, spicy tuna  ADDITIONAL TOPPINGS (included): masago, scallion, red onion, jalapeño, seaweed, cilantro, kale, mixed greens, corn, cabbage, furikake, tempura crunch, avocado, cucumber, mango, radish, pineapple, fried garlic, tempura  EXTRA CHARGE ($1): cream cheese, mango salsa,  1/2 avocado, tamago (omelet)  **Highchairs and booster seats available. **Gender-neutral bathroom."}
{"text":"This is a slightly hidden gem of a quick lunch/dinner spot! The specials are always tasty and the servers are so friendly! I love the bowls so I wear less on my shirt. The rolls are tasty too. and very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't great just okay. The two avocados they put in my entire sushi burrito weren't ripe at all, completely crunchy. Mangoes weren't ripe either. Could've been made better, it fell apart as I ate it. Only upside was the workers who were nice."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. They just opened in December. You can either make your own burrito or bowl, or go off the recipes they already have. The miso soup is also a good side to add to your order."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Great post workout chow for me. 4 stars because it was my first time and when I asked the fellow to guide me through my order, his response was sarcastic. He was then very helpful and the staff was nice. Overall great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I always come in on the night shift & this place is totally the bomb. I love everyone on the night crew here -- especially the blonde one, Grace! She is always working when I go in & is super nice & helpful. She is honestly 1/2 of the reason I even go. The other 1/2 is the incredible food!! I usually get a build my own on seaweed paper. I love their yum yum and eek sauces. I like that I can always try different things & it's always the same price. It's a great healthy fast food option & its way less expensive than getting sushi at a restaurant!!   I will totally be back for the food & for the great staff!!!"}
{"text":"I consider Sweet Poke a very solid spot considering its many competitors in literally every part of town. I say this because it has the best balance that I've seen so far between fish to rice. They don't jib you out on your proteins like other places *cough* To See Roll *cough* do.   I have tried a various number of poke spots, but this place is the one that keeps me coming back. You actually get full with a regular size, there's plenty of options to mix and match, and a many free sides to add on to your bowl.   I definitely recommend the sesame shoyu. Out of all the sauces I've tried so far, it's definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place because they have sushi burrito.  It's not a bad place.  The burrito portion is small compared to Soho Burrito.  I told the server I wanted avocado and cucumber on my burrito and he only gave me avocado.  I don't know if you can only get one choice but they server VERY little portion on their burritos.  Not that impressed. I still like Soho Burrito."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom and grandma, and were all big fans of poké bowls. it was our first time to this location and we had a wonderful experience. Seth helped us down the line, explained everything to us to help us make the best decision. Can't forget the samples he let us try. He was great and I hope the managers take the time out of their day to read this comment, because Seth was great!"}
{"text":"Always come here, love it! The employees are always nice and welcoming. Great sauces and choices! Big portions, I can never finish my bowl and I get the smallest size. I'm from Hawai'i and LOVE poke and hate eating it down here. But this is the BEST poke in Vegas in my opinion, thank you guys for the touch of home! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great. All the drinks from their soda machine taste funny though. Good portion sizes. Would definitely go again but bringing my own drink."}
{"text":"First time have had this Aloha Roll for $10 and love it! Never tried Sushi Burrito so skeptical and dont really have high expectations, but it turned out great. The store is clean and cool. The only thing is i hope they have somebody works the drive through because nobody was there when i tried to order so i had to walk in."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times as it's my go to poké spot & I'm never disappointed! The quality of the fish is fresh , a wide variety of yummy sauces and ingredients and the staff is phenomenal. You get a generous portion to fill you up for about ten bucks and you have an option to upgrade for about 13 bucks if you get a bowl . If you're looking for delicious poké come here !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came here a few days ago because I had a ton of time to kill before my class and was hungry. I did a regular sized poke bowl and it was huge! They are definitely generous with the food here. I did the regular bowl with brown rice and tuna as my protein. Then they also have spicy tuna, crab or spicy crab in the toppings as well so you get even more meat! They let you choose any of the toppings and oh man it was delish! They have a lot of veggies to choose from and I would definitely recommend if you're in the area. I had avocado added which was extra. I believe I paid around $13 for the bowl and drink but it was so much food I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is excellent! I went here with my girlfriend about 45 minutes before they close. The entire staff was very helpful & friendly. While our food was being made, they engaged in conversation with us while we waited. My girlfriend ordered a Poké Bowl& I ordered the Spider Sushi Burrito. This was my first time having a Sushi Burrito and it was amazing! So many favors and it was well put together. My girlfriend loves Poké & she's been to a lot of Poké places & she said she loves this place & it's better than the one down the street. What made her enjoy this place so much was the food & the customer service. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Love their burritos!!!!! You'll get a hit or miss on their customer service but their portion sizes are worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I'm not a sushi eater and I like that they have cooked fish options. They have several bowls and sushi burritos to choose from and you can also build your own bowl.  This place is highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Great new spot here in the Walmart shopping center. It's on my way home so I've stopped by three times now after work. Place is very modern new and clean and the staff is really helpful just like at the centennial Sweet Poke iv been to.   As for the food it has been spectacular each time iv been. The Dragon burrito has cooked eel and the spicy tuna makes it to die for. They also gave a me a free miso soup which is the best cuz it's been cold outside. This is definitely my new spot and it's such a great location at Eastern Ave and the 215."}
{"text":"Awesome amazing wonderful. I can't believe they have a sweet poke near UNLV. Iv tried the other two sweet poke places and had to try this one. Just as amazing and delicious as expected. Salmon shaka burrito is the best thing  ever in the whole world. This place is delicious and clean and new. Luv it :)"}
{"text":"Got the salmon and tuna on lettuce bowl for lunch. Delicious. Service was quick I waited about 2min in line before they made my bowl. I'm curious to try the other fish they have alot of options on the menu and they have signature dishes aswell as you can make your own from scratch"}
{"text":"This place is Incredible! i just tried their bay 101, its to die for. I don't know where they got their creamy drinks but it was delicious. It was unlike any soda i've ever had before. its called Creamy Melon soda or something along those lines, but u have to try it. I'm always near the north part of Vegas so i'll definitely be coming by often."}
{"text":"This place needs more training with their staff. Me and my friend ordered the same bowl which is the \"Citrus Salmon bowl\". The portion between the two is way different. The staff should be trained with how much amount to put exact on each bowl.   All in all fish was okay but I've had better POKÉ bowls around town. Just be aware going to this place, I've had the bad experience of it."}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh, every ingredient from the fish to spinach to edamame and corn was delicious. Admittedly I am a little new to poke bowls but the girl who worked there was really nice and gave me recommendations for what to add to my bowl. I ended up with three scoops of fish mixed in two different sauces and a half rice half spinach base with a ton of other stuff on top. I really felt like I got a delicious yet healthy meal."}
{"text":"This is my to go spots for sushi bowls! The food is always good and the stuff always so friendly. I can't really of a problem or complain I even had there.. So far this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Everything from the customer service, cleanliness of the establishment and the food is amazing!   The portions are so generous, you almost feel bad paying the menu price! They don't rush you to order, and are helpful with menu suggestions. I don't write reviews often, but this place was certainly worth mentioning and praise! The chef is a sweetheart and this won't be my last time visiting."}
{"text":"I love pokes and loved them since the first time I ate one. The reason I knocked down a star was just due to the person making it. Some people that work there are greedy with the amount they put . I can order two bowls made by 2 different people and can get 2 completely different sizes of servings in each bowl ."}
{"text":"Poke is really good and on top of your two or three sources of protein, you can also add spicy tuna or crab to your poke bowl. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Sweet Poke opened up near my office recently and I've been twice already. Both times, they've been extremely friendly, let me sample sauces when I wasn't sure what I wanted, were extremely patient, and even had an offer for a free side for December!   They have regular & large sizes for the bowls, and for me the regular is enough! They have quite a few different options for \"protein\" and a lot of veggies to go on top. They make great recommendations for which sauce to go on the proteins. I've gotten tuna both times, but have had 2 different sauces. I don't remember which ones, to be honest, but both were delicious!  Anyway, staff is always super friendly and helpful. It's a small place but there are a few tables.   Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Poke is so fresh and delicious,  my favorite it the 808 spicy tuna. Looking forward to trying everything!!!"}
{"text":"I visited the Eastern location last week and enjoyed it very much! So this time I was in the area so I stopped by the Maryland location, this location wasn't as fantastic as the Eastern location though I still enjoyed it. For some reason my poke bow at the Eastern location tasted better and the fish seemed fresher, I could tell the girl making my bowl was somewhat new so that may have been a factor in it.   I got white rice as my base and double salmon as my proteins (you get to choose two proteins for the regular bowl I think $10, 3 for the large I believe $11.50). You get to choose a sauce which they mix up your proteins in so each piece is covered they also offer masago as a topping for no extra charge. After proteins you move on to toppings they have a good assortment of them. They offer surimi crab (regular or spicy) and avocado and no additional cost which is amazing. At most places surimi crab would be considered a protein not an included topping and avocado seems to always cost extra. So far out of all the new poke bowl/sushi burrito spots I think the Eastern location of sweet poke is at the top of the list with themaryland location right behind it. The only reason I'm giving this location a 4 star review is because the Eastern location was noticeably better in my opinion."}
{"text":"My new favorite poke/ sushi burrito place!! These type of places are really trending right now, like 5 of them of in this area just popped out of no where buuuuut im not complaining tho haha. I feel like their menu was simple which is a good thing! They also had a lot of options to put in the burrito that i haven't seen at other places. Like they didn't charge me to put avocado and seaweed salad. Service was good, they helped me make selections!"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly here and it's kept clean. The price of the items are very good for the quality you get. You can tell the employees are still getting used to what goes in all their poké bowls and sushi burritos, but I think with time it'll get better."}
{"text":"I had never eaten a Sushi Burrito, so when I saw it as an option on the menu I jumped at the chance to try. Now I'm afraid to try it if I see it on another menu. If its is not gonna taste even remotely close the Sushi Burrito I got from Sweet Poke` I will be highly dissatisfied. Also the CSR Brandon was the Perfect Welcoming Committee. He gave me a couple of suggestions, and clearly explained the Build your own option. Made my choice super easy. I've got s feel in I'll be back there in a few days."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  The poke bowls here are amazing!  I had the Ahi and Hamachi with a stack of yummy toppings. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful (which is a rarity these days). This was my first poke/sushi bowl/burrito experience. This is my new favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"When I first came to Sweet Poke, it was amidst the whole influx of sushi burritos restaurants opening up like crazy. I had had Jaburritos at the time and loved that, then subsequently came to To See Roll, and then finally, I tried out Sweet Poke. Since I literally had so many choices, they were pretty much all the same to me.   Fast forward to this day, I haven't had Jaburritos in a VERY long time because it's close to work and we ate it so much that I'm absolutely sick of it.   After trying out Sweet Poke more, I realized To See Roll's portions fall short and now I always go to Sweet Poke. Also very convenient that it's on the way home and I visit that plaza a lot more often now.   I started off getting their set items but nowadays I always create my own. They're generous with portions and I absolutely always have enough to eat. The staff are always very friendly and I love how they're a part of the Perka (app) program so you can get your own digital stamp card."}
{"text":"Solid poke place: I had tuna and salmon on brown rice with an assortment of toppings. I think they put a bit too much sauce on, which tends to overwhelm the taste of the fish. But I enjoyed the mral, and it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love the poke here!  Did the Create your poke salad bowl with mixed greens: Selected: - Salmon - Sesame Shoyu Sauce - Spicy Tuna - Seaweed - Avocado - Red Onions  Most delicious!  I'll come back, for sure!    Polite and courteous staff and very patient."}
{"text":"Hmmm.. I was debating between 2 or 3 stars but they got 3 for friendly staff. The fish is decently fresh but their spicy tuna and their crab mix had zero flavor. The crab was bland and the spicy tuna actually tasted bad- couldn't finish it. Not enough topping selection. And not to mention, I paid $16 for my bowl and a drink. Way to expensive for what they're serving."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place almost every weekend! The fish and toppings are fresh and there is a wide variety! Sesame shoyu sauce is my favorite, staff is friendly, and Reggae is an awesome employee!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying I love poke. This isn't my favorite poke place, but it is pretty good. This restaurant has a good selection and good prices. Everything tasted very fresh. My main issue was the sauce I guess, I asked for the house sauce thinking it would be a traditional poke sauce and was given a creamy sauce that sort of tasted like mustard which really threw me off. Sauce is mostly what you taste so that was really a make it or break it for me. I added some yummy toppings which included some fried garlic. The toppings were great except for the garlic which was extremely hard to chew and in my opinion didn't fit in with any of the flavors. The service was pretty good. I also am not sure that the extra scoop of protein should constitute as a large but hey that might just be me. I may have just constructed a not so tasty bowl, but to me it was pretty good, not great. I don't see myself going out of my way to come back again."}
{"text":"This is best Poke burrito in Vegas and the crew is always nice, my favorite is the citrus salmon"}
{"text":"Went in and asked for ramen and got served a dish with no ramen??? it was a poke bowl so wouldn't recommend anyone not knowing what they're doing to go in."}
{"text":"Must try!!!  Somewhat stumbled onto this spot from running errands.  Let's get down to it.  Super clean dining area as well as an open view of the ingredients bar.  Well staffed,  so the line moved quickly. Very helpful too.  They suggested what went well with the individual dishes that we got as well as personal favorites.  For the price you get a really nice portion.  Would recommend to anyone trying to get a poke fix,  or a first timer.    Side note -  they use really nice bowls almost like Tupperware for their take out/bowl options.  I continuously see the ingredients being switched out and there is staff in the kitchen behind the scenes there too. The staff at the counter is also cleaning continously too.  (it is raw fish after all)  A+ for service and A++ for the food."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this gem opened up in centennial hills. I ordered a poké bowl with 1 scoop tuna, 1 scoop salmon. They have a huge variety of sauces I had a hard time deciding, thankfully the girl behind the counterl allowed me to sample a couple of them! I was very impressed with the quality of the poké, however, I will skip the seaweed salad next time."}
{"text":"Welcoming & super friendly staff! They always greet you with a smile & give you great service.   If you haven't been here, its like Chipotle, Seafood Chipotle. You choose from bowls to burritos, Sushi burritos.   Food is delly, always on point. Must try if you like seafood.   Prices are super affordable. Like $9.50 for a bowl or burrito. And more then enough to fill you up. Its a steal. Try it."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work, so I'm always on the hunt for some cheap, healthy, quick, food when I get to a new city. This place met all the criteria. The staff here were super helpful, and explained what goes into the poke bowls since this was my first experience with the dish. I ended up getting mixed greens, salmon, tuna, spicy ginger sauce, spicy tuna, edemame, ginger, jalapeños, cilantro, nori, cucumber.... pretty much everything except the fried topping options. It was heaven. Got the seaweed salad as my side choice, which wasnt that great -  a little too sweet for my taste but it didnt matter at that point because I was so happy with the poke bowl.   I will absolutely be going here again next time I'm in Vegas for work."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Such fresh fish and yummy sauces. The staff is always so friend and helpful! My fav burrito is the shrimp lover and I add a bit of mango. Sooo good!   This is my go to spot for sushi especially when I'm on a budget... which is always lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place by pure chance, and we are coming back. :)  Just amazing ! Great fast lunch spot ."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight and was really impressed. I had the shrimp lovers burrito and it was fantastic!!  It was like eating a sushi roll burrito style. It was fun and delicious. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town to get fresh poke! The staff is friendly and attentive - the atmosphere is clean and bright. Also - the food is amazing and full of flavor. I for sure will be returning frequently for my favorite Ahi bowl"}
{"text":"Love love love this place !!! I was actually headed to a similar poke place when I seen this one newly opened I'm glad I stopped !!! So worth it delicious and fresh"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! It was our first time here with my Boyfriend (He's Hawaiian , I'm Mexican) We were so impressed by Gunnar (hope we got his name right) was Amazing! We got to sample items and put together the most perfect bowls/ Burritos! The salmon / brown rice and all the veggies were so delicious and fresh! A whole lot of bang for your buck. We will definitely make this a weekly maybe × 2 lunch/ dinner spot."}
{"text":"First time here, stopped by since my daughter wanted some poke for her birthday and she loves it. She wants to come back again because she gets big portions here. She's making sure nothing is left in her plate."}
{"text":"Just an update -- still in love with this place! My husband and I eat here at least once or twice a week! I recently tried the Spider burrito! WOW! So good. My usual is a bowl with all my favorites! If you haven't tried Sweet Poké, you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"Your new workers need an attitude check came in 8:33 and asked if it was closed they both looked at each other with a \"ugh oh well\" face and all the toppings they put on she basically threw in the bowl with attitude... also maybe give them another lesson on health department regulations... that one guy literally keeps touching EVERYTHING with his gloves even his glasses and then prepares food with the same gloves and you seriously don't need to be on dirty dining's again .... are the old workers still there ? They're friendly not these 2 from last night Btw this is not the first time I've been here ... I've been here a lot and besides those 2 workers I'd give this place a 5star"}
{"text":"This location is the best put of the ones I've been too. They never short you on the proteins and the burritos are always huge!"}
{"text":"OMG! Sooooo good. I have been here multiple times since moving back to Las Vegas and might be in love.  Shrimp Lover Burrito is my fav and I always get extra tempura. They are a good size too. Some of the sushi burrito places are tiny.  Normally there is always a line so give yourself a little time, but once you get to the front it's quick. My husband isn't big on seafood, so he gets the chicken bowl with no complaints."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and the restaurant very clean.  I watched as staff stopped to wash their hands or put on fresh gloves during the prep of each bowl.  We were surprised that the food as was good as it was and the portions are very generous.  This is our new Saturday lunch favorite."}
{"text":"Saw that this new place opened up in town and thought we'd give it a try since we love sushi & love trying new eateries.  Tried poke for the first time at Sweet Poke and have already returned twice, totalling us at 3 times in just one week.  To start off the staff is super friendly, and very HELPFUL! I always come packed with lots of questions & they always answered them all!  Sometimes when ordering a sushi roll its hard to know if youll like it, theres so many names you've never heard  & sauces you probably cant even pronounce. Here you can build your entire sushi bowl or burrito with all of the things you know you love! & if you're curious about an ingredient or sauce you can try it out before committing to it. Bottom line is the place is clean, food is fresh & staff is great! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Quality poke!  Lots of topping choices. My ahi and salmon were great, nice side scoop of spicy tuna as well."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of options and the build your own is way better than the set combinations.   I had a scoop of ahi, cooked unagi and yellow tail over a bed of greens of my choice.  That's 3 scoops, which is considered the large bowl and 2 scoops mix and match is the regular bowl.  Then on top of that I got spicy tuna, avocado, cilantro, ginger, seaweed salad, nori strips and whatnot until I was satisfied with filling my bowl at no extra cost. The fish was fresh, the food was filling, prices are a little high, but we used a buy one get one half off deal to check out this new poke joint.  Solid if you're into all the fresh ingredients to doctor up the norm poke.  I stuck with a light drizzle of simple spicy ponzu as to not overwhelm by crazy bowl with more flavor.    The next time, I think I'll need some brown rice with my poke and then mix some greens with it.  I was surprised, but they cooked by eel on the side to ensure it was nice and hot before laying those 3 pieces back in my bowl of creation.  Prior establishment was a burger joint, now revamped...  The ambiance is bare, but it's bright and open. When we first walked in and to my amazement I have the same dining chairs in our home.  I'm not sure if that's the compliment or not.  This place is clean, bright and offers fresh build your own poke.   The large cooked burritos are wrapped in tortillas, but you can get the poke burritos that is wrapped in either seaweed or soy paper.  As I mentioned, lots of choices.    I came, I liked, but not an everyday thing for me."}
{"text":"Went with a create your own poke bowl w/ brown rice, spicy tuna, soft shell crab, spinach, onions, jalapeños, mango salsa, house spicy sauce, spicy mayo, roasted garlic chips and spicy crab topped with seaweed salad! All business no picture.... was critically in the HANGERY ZONE!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite poke bowl place in town right now. Here's the lowdown ~  THE GOOD: + clean location + helpful and friendly staff + different sizes and prices + good portions + cute presentation + lots of different options for proteins, sauces and toppings + they have spicy crab, which is unique  THE STANDARD: ~ average prices ($10 for regular bowl)  THE BAD: - nada  OVERALL: 4.5  I really like this place. They have plenty of options, different sizes, and good portions. Plus, it doesn't feel like they skimp out like other places and it's all for a decent price. The quality is good, but it doesn't blow me away, and they don't have a lot that separates them from the competition, hence the 4.5, but it's still everything I want and expect from a build your own poke bowl place."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are bashing this place, I love Sweet Poke! They're still new & doing a great job. Really cool food style, and the burritos & bowls are delicious for GREAT prices."}
{"text":"First time yelping but becuase of how great the service was I had to yelp!!   This was the first time having a sushi burrito,  so coming in I had no idea what I was doing or how to order. The person helping me Kevin broke everything down and helped me through the process. I ended with a somehwat custome dragon bowl with pineapple and tempura crunch. Delicious!!  I Will be back tomorrow and maybe the next day!"}
{"text":"My first sushi burrito experience! I saw a coupon for this place and decided to try my first sushi burrito. It is located on Eastern Ave just south of the 215. We arrived just after 11:00 for lunch.   SInce it was my first time I had some questions. The girl taking our order must have been new because she didn't know very much. She couldn't even explain the different sauces without having to ask someone else. I started with my seaweed wrapper with white rice and chose salmon and tuna for my two proteins. Sweet Poke has a large amount of both raw and cooked fish. You move on down the line to choose your toppings and sauce.   They have many different veggie and fruit toppings as well as spicy crab or spicy tuna. Finally it is all wrapped up and cut for you. I really enjoyed looking at all the different Japanese drinks they offer, very unique. They also have macaron's and macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert.   The total was about $18 with our \"buy one, get one 50% off\" coupon. A very reasonable price for what you get. We sat inside at the small seating area. After my first couple bites the burrito started to fall apart and was hard to eat. The fish however was very fresh tasting and I loved all the flavors of the tuna, salmon, avocado and mango. I was happy with my first sushi burrito and would definitely return to try some different combinations.   I did think it was strange its called \"Sweet Poke\", but they don't even have Poke as an option?? When I asked the girl if they had Poke she looked at me completely puzzled."}
{"text":"I ordered the Dragon as a bowl instead of a burrito. I always go to the sushi burrito place on campus at UNLV and love it so I was hoping this lived to the expectations. Asked for extra spinach twice and the girl was so stingy about it. Otherwise, was great!"}
{"text":"First time here.  There was about 7people in line ahead of us. 4 workers. And it took a half an hour for us to get our food. Food was good. But service was VERY slow. SoHo Sushi Burrito has both great food and fast service. Maybe in time, they'll speed up."}
{"text":"Pretty Ono bowls! The rice was just right. Got the 808, added a few extras and the flavor worked well together! So happy it's up the street."}
{"text":"From the time i stepped in the door till the moment i left , i felt number one to the employees , the fish and hundreds of toppings was overwhelming in the best way . I got the 808 / Dragon and fell in love . Clean , simple and fast . Will be back"}
{"text":"From the time i stepped in the door till the moment i left , i felt number one to the employees , the fish and hundreds of toppings was overwhelming in the best way . I got the citrus salmon and fell in love . Will most definitely be coming back ."}
{"text":"What a great experience from start to finish! The young man behind the counter helped me decide what to get and I ended up getting a Seattle bowl with raw salmon and it was delicious! The place was clean, the food was good and fresh, the staff was friendly and the price was good! Unlike most places, this place doesn't charge you extra for every single topping you get. I usually go to another local poké place but this will be my new spot! The food is as good as my personal usual place but the prices at Sweet Pokè are better!"}
{"text":"I usually go to a different location but saw this one and figured I'd stop in. Their food is pretty good and the service is OK. Nothing wrong but nothing great either. I was definitely a little disappointed because the location on Eastern and 215 has such excellent customer service and is always busy but this place almost felt like it was closed and customer service was just OK because she felt like she was just there to do a job while their Eastern and 215 location is informative and make you feel welcomed. Also, their portions seemed a bit smaller than I usually get. As a reply to the owner comment: I am aware that I can add additional toppings because I order the exact same bowl every time and that is how I can tell that the portions are smaller. This is a preselected bowl on your menu, not one that I created myself. The amount of customers that a store serves should not determine whether they serve larger or smaller portions.  So, I came back nearly a year later to try out this location one more time. This time my portion was up to par but, within less than an hour of eating here, I became sick to my stomach and vomited the rest of the day! As stated in my previous post, I eat at another Sweet Poke location at least 2x per month and have never had an issue. I will not be back a third time!"}
{"text":"I come here often, they give you way more food than any other sushi burrito/poke place I've tried. The food is well priced and fresh. The staff is amazing and they're always in a good mood. I usually do the build your own because you can pick and choose your toppings. My advice is to download the Perka app, every 10th bowl is free, and there's nothing wrong with free... lol"}
{"text":"Compared to the other similar \"poke\" places sweet poke easily gets 4-5 stars. As people have stated the poke bowl places are not traditional Hawaiian poke. I don't think that really matters as long as the food tastes good. The awesome thing about sweet poke is that they give you an extra scoop of spicy tuna or krab mix on top of the 2 or 3 scoops of fish you get depending on the size of the bowl you're ordering. I personally love the wasabi aioli, I get it mixed in the fish on the spring mix and an extra side of it lol. I also get an extra side of spicy garlic ponzu to add to my poke salad bowl. I literally ate a large poke bowl last night in about 5 minutes, always very good."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I love it! The food is fresh, staff is helpful and friendly, never a disappointment! I've had both burritos and bowls but I prefer to build my own :). Brought my bf here (his first time) and he loved it as well! Simply delicious! I let's cheaper than going out for sushi yet still fulfilling. Keep it up sweet poke!!"}
{"text":"First sushi burrito! Excellent!! I recommend this place if u are a sushi fan! I got the ahi tuna with soypaper...its pretty filling even for regular size! Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This location is just okay, compared to the Eastern & 215 location which we frequent.   The rice was dry and they skimped on every single scoop that went into my Poke bowl. I had to ask numerous times for additional protein (Salmon & cooked shrimp) because I was being given 3 to 4 pieces if that. I also had to pay a $1 for avocado if I wanted more than 2 slices, which I totally wouldn't mind if the avocado was actually ripe enough to eat. And, on top of all of that - my bowl had no flavor because I was given 2 squirts of sauce.  As a result, I had the most bland poke bowl EVER! If I tried this location before the other, I definitely wouldn't have returned. On that note, be sure to watch as they prepare your bowl and you should be good to go!"}
