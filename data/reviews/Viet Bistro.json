{"text":"Went the first time and got the Chicken Pho. It was good, but the soup itself wasn't HOT, it was Luke warm. I'm used to it at other places being very Hot, like soup should be. So I decided to order it again a week later, take out this time, and when I got home, again the soup was  only a little Warm. Once I heated the soup myself ( stove top) it was good!  So yes good ONCE SOUP IS HOT!!  Recommend telling them to serve it HOT!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for at least 5 years. The pho is always delicious with fresh ingredients and the banh mi is great even though the bread looks very white. It's so nice to get great pho without having to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain. Love this place"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how this restaurant has such high reviews. Maybe my friends and I went there on a bad day. The food was average, service was ok... But then we all discovered BUGS and HAIR in our food. Not just like small little bugs... But bits and pieces of beetles. Yes, that's right. Beetles. We about threw up (and we are all RNs so you know it takes a lot to make us feel sick). When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she told us that what we thought were bugs were actually spices they use in the soup. she brought out a container of the spice and it didn't look anything like the bugs. To give you more detail, in one bowl of pho, we found the head and the body (separated from each other) of a beetle. You cant mistake that for a spice. As long as you have eyes you can tell the difference. Anyway, we won't be back. If you decide to take a risk and eat there I would just look at each bite very carefully before you eat it."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant close to the south Summerlin area.  I remembered that one had opened in the shopping center near Grand Canyon and Flamingo, but couldn't remember the name of it.  After trying a number of web searches, I finally found the adjacent Sushi Tower restaurant, because Viet Bistro could not be found when I Googled a search for Vietnamese restaurants near 89135.  I finally found a a \"sister\" Viet Bistro restaurant, which had to provide the location on Grand Canyon as well as the phone number.   I finally found the location and and the food was very good and they did a nice job on the interior of the restaurant.  I wouldn't normally waste this much time looking for a restaurant, but there are no other Vietnamese restaurants within a reasonable proximity.     With the difficulty of trying to find information on this Viet Bistro location, including address and online menu, I would be a bit concerned that they may not be in business very long.  I truly wish them success and recommend them - I also have a suggestion, specifically, get a web site and some visibility so people can find and try your restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was really good. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. It was very aromatic of lemongrass and cilantro. So if you don't like those flavors, I wouldn't recommend ordering this, as these are quite predominant. We also ordered fried won-tons with sweet chili sauce and pork spring rolls for an appetizer. Both were delicious.  I will come here again and try something new."}
{"text":"My new favorite pho spot! So glad I discovered this a few weeks ago. I may never drive to Spring Mountain for pho again!  The pho is top notch with a very flavorful delicious broth and a pretty generous serving. I tried the Bun Bo Hue for the very first time anywhere and now I'm hooked. I usually get the Crispy Imperial Rolls to start off then a nice steaming bowl of one of their savory soups along with a nice Thai ice tea to finish things off.   The staff is very nice and friendly and are always very attentive. The restaurant is small but cozy and I've never had to wait for a seat so I can straight to the food! I definitely will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Good food. This is a very casual place with nothing special about the decor, except the purple walls are kinda fun. Good food fast."}
{"text":"The food was ok not as good as a particular veit. Pho. SERVICE was not that good she didn't exactly get my order right no check ins and did not understand me well"}
{"text":"This place is great for those that just quit smoking... no, not really.. the cigar smell bleeds through these walls. the food is not that great."}
{"text":"Had this ridiculous craving for spring rolls, but didn't wanna drive to Chinatown. I did the next best thing and found Viet Bistro on Yelp.  Just needed a quick bite to eat before work so I ordered it to go. The peanut sauce that came with them was pretty good, and the spring rolls themselves were light and refreshing to munch on. Also got a Thai tea with boba to go with my meal. Although the boba was a bit misshapen and clumpy, the tea was made just right, so I'd recommend getting that by itself.  I think that $4.50 for an order of two spring rolls is a little much, but I'm willing to pay since it saved me a trip to Spring Mountain. Otherwise, the service was great and friendly. I'll have to come back to eat in to form a complete opinion of this place."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place and one of the few good Vietnamese restaurants I've found outside of the Chinatown area.  The pho is delicious, and I also love the crispy salt and pepper calamari and lemongrass chicken."}
{"text":"Yummy....service is always extra nice...The food is delish! I can't come to vegas without popping in here.  The viet coffee puts any Starbucks coffee to absolute shame...."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Numerous spelling errors in the menu, prices changed immediately upon opening, noted in the menu with pen & stickers. Prices are too high for the quality of food. Ordered the Pho- certainly not as good as many other restaurants in town that serve pho. I won't return. Also service at lunch time was terrible, cannot come here for a normal lunch service if you need to be in & out."}
{"text":"My experience here made me create a yelp account.  Starting with the positives - plenty of space and seating available, overall friendly staff, and affordable options on the menu.  On the flip side I felt the food portions and attention to detail were subpar.    Food portions - There are three different sizes of pho on the menu - small, large, and xl.  Being as hungry as I was I ordered the xl.  The waitress showed up with a big bowl of broth.  Never in my life have I finished eating a bowl (let alone an xl) of pho still feeling hungry.    The details - when I received my check, it was unclear as to whether I was supposed to pay at the table or pay at the register.  I sat around unnecessarily for a while...they certainly could have explained that better.  When I went to pay, they said they did not accept American Express although the sticker on the door said Amex.  When I questioned them about the sticker on the door they said they forgot to scratch it off...but still asked for a different form of payment.  I wanted to like this restaurant but unfortunately it was the small food portions and lack of detail (and the fact they don't accept Amex) that makes me not want to go back here.  When you don't pay attention to the details on the floor who knows what goes on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been to two previous places for pho and didn't see what the big deal was with pho, it wasn't a good as I thought it would be. Then I came across this place! It's close to my work, wish it was closer to my home. The pho is so delicious, always hot and love the prices."}
{"text":"Very good sevice; friendly and quick.  We had a combination of pho and bun.  Side vegetables were fresh and crisp, although eat the jalapeños wth care...they are no joke! :)"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town!  The service is top notch and the environment is great. I eat here every other week. So far I am in love with the spring rolls and crispy tofu."}
{"text":"Probably the blandest pho broth I've ever had in my life. There was no flavor. Even the basils and bean sprouts are sad looking (dead). After a few bites, I stopped eating, paid for the worst pho and left. Not returning."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had 2 different soups that I would usually order from Vietnamese joints, and loved them.  Everything tastes great."}
{"text":"After going to Bamboo Bistro and Hue Thai for several years, Viet Bistro finally opened at my end of town.  Stopped in for lunch the other day, and was SO HAPPY!  It is at least as good as Bamboo Bistro (my fav until they moved WAAAAAY south) and better than Hue Thai (my second fav).  The fresh spring rolls were very good, and my vermicelli bowl with grilled pork was one of the best I've had in Vegas.  I am originally from San Jose, CA where the Vietnamese community is very big, and restaurants are plentiful and very good, so I am very pleased that Viet Bistro is not far from home and is so good!  Pho (pronounced FAH for you novices) is my choice for my next visit."}
{"text":"Vegetarian pho with veggie broth -  I'm always happy to find that.  Broth is decent -  not the best I've had but perfectly good. Chock full of veggies and ultra fresh. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Sadly subpar, pho was acceptable if you are really needing a fix but much less than noteworthy. Spring rolls were filled with iceberg lettuce and no noodles which was very odd. Not likely to return. Better options within driving distance."}
{"text":"Great place. I come to Eat food not to have some jerk waiter fake glad smile at me and tell me some crap special I don't want to hear. The waitress was great. You order your food, she brings it to you. What more can you ask for. We had the beef carpaccio and pho with round eye and a side of filet. We live in NLV so not many pho places to choose from on the NW, but this place is the best on this side of town."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho that I have had here in Las Vegas. Great portion size and the help is very accommodating. Definitely going back!! Several times. U must try Viet Bistro."}
{"text":"They are very courteous and friendly. Food is 3 stars because the broth is not so rich and serving is dwindling. It was great at first but lately not so much."}
{"text":"The service was OK for being 1 of 3 tables there.the nem noung and goi coung were horrible definitely don't recommend them.  We order the pho and it was pretty good.  We had ordered the shaking beef with red rice the taste of it is good but the rice and beef were dry. We also order the grilled pork banh mi and it had cha lua and bbq pork and no grilled pork what the hell? the tri colored dessert can't screw that up  The hot tea is really good nice fragrance"}
{"text":"I've never tried Vietnamese in my life, and I always passd Viet Bistro when coming to grab some cigars at the shop next door. I finally decided to try it.   And it was amazing. I had the sheking beef. Unbelievable. Literally the best asian food I've ever had. The dish came with a sizzling skillet of teh beef with onions and other spices in it, and some rice. It was $12, but the food was fantastic adn the serving was pretty healthy. I was stuffed.   I've noticed some complaints about the smell in side with the cigar shop next door. being a cigar smoker I can instantly pick up on the smell when it's in the air and I did not notice it much in the resturant. Certainly nothing compared to inside the cigar shop. Perhaps some folks just have more sensitive noses. If it does bother you, then I still reccomend take out.   I will be visiting again and again."}
{"text":"Great grilled pork & cha lua sandwich.  I also ordered grilled pork& egg roll noodles- awesome flavor.  I don't recommend their che dessert with green jelly and beans.  The beans would be a lot better if they were paste and the jelly way too hard. The waiter was really friendly and helpful with my modified order from the menu.  I would definitely eat there again:))"}
{"text":"By far this is my spot awesome customer service & the boss kevin is the boom, funny, & freindly guy! He takes care you!!! :-)"}
{"text":"To put it simply:  Go in yesterday morning and order the combination pho with a mango smoothie.  Woke up this morning and wound up going to the bathroom and vomitting.  That said: it was tasty going down and the service was decent.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Missing a star because of Service and disappointing Ban Xeo...  Pros: Pretty authentic Vietnamese food and offerings. Not a big fan of their Pho broth, but that's only because I don't like a lot of star anise in my broth. They do have an outstanding Bun Bo Hue (BBH) soup! Some reviewers have complained that their broth is bland. Not to sound like some sanctimonious soup consumer, but authentically, in Thai and Vietnamese cooking, the broth isn't supposed to be overly seasoned with salt as to allow for customization. Viet Bistro is one of the only few Vietnamese restaurants that actually have good fish sauce on the table!   The Chicken and Shrimp Satay skewers were really good, but I prefer the shrimp. Their Beef Bahn Mi was also delicious! I'm partial to the \"brown paste\" which may be their version of pâté, traditionally spread alongside mayo. I've begun to omit the \"paste\" and stick with mayo and splash of soy sauce.   Cons:  Huge fan of Ban Xeo (crepe with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts). \"Ekkk\"...that was terrible! Nothing about it was right. The batter was bland and the shrimp and chicken weren't seasoned AT ALL.   Service is definitely lacking. Definitely not employing experienced wait staff (with very limited English). Not exactly proactive in clearing plates or filling glasses either, but oh well. When you LOVE good food, service isn't the reason to go to these types of establishment."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's nice to have family gathering and have dinner together enjoy real Chinese food, my favorite dishes Oyster with black bean sauce and baby snow pea leaves, stream chicken. Thanks to Chef Chan ......"}
{"text":"I am extremely pleased with the quality and taste of the food and the very inviting, exceptional service! This place is very close to home and I'm so glad that I don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown to get some good pho. As a matter of fact, I think it actually tastes better than the dirty restaurants in Chinatown. This place is new, modern, and .... Clean !!!... and most importantly, the food is good!   Came here with my husband and a friend. Two of us had the special pho (with everything in it), bun bo hue and a grilled pork sandwich. The sandwich was especially good and the two soups tasted great too. The broth was done perfectly.   The owner even made me a special vinegar onion, but he made it with limes. How sweet of him to show such hospitality on my first visit!   Definitely will be coming back and telling all my friends about this place to support them!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this restaurant scored only 1 star from me! The food tasted terrible. General chicken as listed on the menu(aka- general tso's chicken) was super bland, no flavor and the chicken tasted old. The next food was the combination fried rice which was $11.00 contained very small amount and greasy. But $11.00 for a fried rice??? WTH??? Who charges $11.00 for fried rice??? They're suppose to be located around the campus area with lots of students and as for the price, it was way too expensive for the food quality. I definitely won't be going back!   Also, do not order the spring rolls. The wrap was hard and tasted old!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent service and great food. I usually order the Special Pho which has all the meats in it. The food comes out hot and the servers are always friendly and helpful. I really enjoy getting my pho fix here because the prices are great and the quality is always fresh. Plenty of fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts and chili to add to your pho too. I brought my Puerto Rican friends to try Vietnamese food for the first time and they said it was was surprisingly good. They said they weren't sure what to expect, maybe Chinese type food, but  I recommended the pork chop and rice and they enjoyed it. Yay! I usually order hot tea as well and it's very flavorful. Always will make time to try to get food from here."}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather and craving pho' and this place really hit the spot..took it to go and must say they give you more than what its worth u had dinner for 2 days for less than 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Ordered the spring rolls, grilled pork rice noodles and Thai ice tea, so satisfying. I will come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my friends today after hearing about it from our hairdresser. We were nicely greeted by the workers, who we later found out were the owners of the restaurant. I've eaten at many Viet places and this was a pleasant visit.   It was supposed to be a light lunch, however, because the menu looked so interesting, we decided to try a number of items.    I had the special spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo, as they call it). It was well seasoned and the spiciness gave it a good kick.  I've never had this noodle anywhere else before, and since this was one of their signature soup entrees, I had a go with it.   My female friend tried the Beef La Lot (which was this deliciously aromatic bbq beef wrapped inside an edible green leaf and then grilled to perfection).  My guy friend ordered the Beef Pho and it was well flavored. It was accompanied by a plateful of vegetable garnishings, which were very fresh.   The three of us shared an order of 4 spring rolls (nothing like chinese eggrolls).  These were crunchy and crispy and it was accompanied by a plateful of lettuce and noodles.  It was such a healthful experience and then afterwards we also tried some desserts. The creme brulee and the 3 colored gelatin dessert was a great way to clean our palate.  Not to mention that the recommended ginger iced tea lemonade also did the trick on such a hot day as today.  It was cold and refreshing after a hearty meal.  The owner even recommended for us to try their 'banh mi' sandwiches and so we did (figured we'd want to snack on something a little later).    I'll be back and my friends will be back as well."}
{"text":"I go here frequently, always order to go since there is a smoke shop next door. I love their Pho combo soup, their broth is high quality, also really good staff attention... We will keep coming back !"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly, fast, and delicious! I came in needing to nurse a nasty hangover and I had a tasty bowl of bun bo hue in front of me in no time.  Since moving across town I needed somewhere to substitute my regular visits to Lemongrass Cafe.  I may have found it!"}
{"text":"Great pho place! Extremely friendly staff and fast service. Dining room is clean and updated with modern decor. They take credit cards unlike several Vietnamese places I've visited. Smaller size pho is quite large! Great peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been to Viet Bistro many times as it is the closest Pho in the northwest. I prefer a few of the Pho restaurants in China Town but for days when I am too tired to drive there this is where we go. It is for the most part as good as any Pho, broth is flavorful, decent sized. The Satay has great flavor but it definetely spicy. I have also ordered the Bun before which is also good, what is to be expected. We normally get the spring rolls too which comes with a peanut sauce, again good but nothing outstanding.  I prefer my peanut sauce a little thicker but at least the peanut flavor is good.   The two things I don't like about this place is it is a $1 or $2 more than other Pho restaurants and it is right next door to a Cigar shop, the smell of Cigars (which I like in certain settings but not with food) seeps into the restaurant. I think the smell must come from the ventilation because there is no way that much just comes in from the outside.   So bottom line if you are looking for decent Pho in the northwest then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place was great! ordered the Special Combination Banh Mi as well as the Special Combination Bun (rice vermicelli bowl) SO MUCH FOOD!! Could have used a bit more nuoc mam but all in all the flavors were great and what I expected! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"P6 soup very good.  Add spicey sauce. Good meal.  However, there is a cigar bar next door and the smoke from there enters the restaurant and stinks.  This was so bad that last time I was there, I had my meal changed from eating there to \"to go.\""}
{"text":"My favorite pho spot in vegas. Service is amazing. I love to support mom and pop resturants... but only when its good! This place has authentic Vietnamese food. Their Pho and spring rolls are my favorite, but I also love their shaken beef! Always busy which shows how great this place is. And the servers have all been top notch:) give this place a A+"}
{"text":"If you have the craving and don't want to go down to china town this may work for you. egg rolls are good , I have had the BBQ pork vermicelli and the Pho...both are good! service was prompt."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! We all had the shrimp and pork vermicelli bowl and we all we're HUMMING!!! Make sure you ask for Kevin, the owner. He is very charming and will have the chef make whatever you want. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Have had take-out from this place twice. It's alright for satisfying pho cravings when I don't want to drive all the way to Chinatown, but there are definitely better places than this.   This is personal taste, but the soup broth in the pho is a bit too sweet. Perhaps it's the recipe, but it tasted like they added too much cinnamon to it. Also, the portions are a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"I had my first meal at Viet Bistro this week and was elated with the enormous menu selection, excellent food, and great service. I was accompanied by my boyfriend who does not typically like Vietnamese food; however, he thoroughly enjoyed his Com Bo Luc Lac. I tried it as well, and the beef was tender and well-seasoned. I ordered Pho Tai and found the broth to be very tasty and the thin slices of beef also very tender. Having recently moved to Vegas from the SF Bay Area, I was worried that I wouldn't find an authentic, high-quality Vietnamese restaurant. Looks like I was wrong! :)"}
{"text":"Noodles was decent. Lacking in beverage listed on menu. The cigar shop odor next door came into the restaurant."}
{"text":"The pho broth is really light compared to some places where they overdo it with the MSG. The waiter also wears a trench coat and dress shoes. That's what I'm talking about!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, a little surprised about this place.   it's in summerlin and thought the standards would be a bit higher.   walking into the restaurant, I noticed the window tinting was peeling off and the doors and windows hadn't been cleaned in awhile. not a good first impression.   went to the men's room and really messy: garbage on floor, toilet not cleaned as well as floors and general area (out of towels to dry my hands too). ordered spring rolls and a bun dish.  spring rolls were decent (first time I've had them with iceberg lettuce inside).  could have had a little more mint leaves.  peanut sauce good. bun (vermicelli noodles with egg rolls and grilled pork).  average.  again, iceberg lettuce and lots of bean sprouts.   Service good. nice server and smiled."}
{"text":"Just ok pho - very bland.  I am not sure why this place gets such a high rating.  You are better off driving to spring mountain for some great pho.  Also, being right next to a cigar shop doesn't help."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho! I always get the vegetable pho and an order of the spring rolls.  I love the peanut sauce it comes with! DELISH! This location smells really bad like cigars and cigarette smoke so I usually order it to-go, but they opened another location on 215 and Flamingo which has the exact same menu and doesn't smell :)"}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't wanna eat here for the simple fact I didn't like Pho. However I agreed to eat here.. Now I'll become a regular. Had the sandwiches which were amazing, He had the Pho, it was really Gd to the point I want my own bowl next time !!!    Tina was great, very attentive and answered the 1000 questions we asked her. Lol only bad thing for me was the coffee was way too strong ( I like watered down coffee ) but this is our new spot !!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here after reading the reviews for a bowl of Pho on a day when I needed some soup.  It was very good.  Had a craving again yesterday and went through the reviews again and decided to try the Bun Bo Hue.  It is amazing!  I got my order to go and it would feed 4 people (but, I enjoyed it all myself!).  It was quite the package also!  It came with a container of the broth, a bag with sprouts, lime and jalapeño peppers and a container with warm noodles, fresh herbs (cilantro and something else), thinly sliced onions and then 3 proteins Tofu, pork and beef strips.  The pork was fatty and melted into the soup.   The service here is very good and the restaurant is clean and bright and still a little bit of a hole in the wall so that you feel like you have really found a gem.  As I left I looked sadly at all the silly people piling into the nearby Panera and Chipotle.  They didn't even know what they were missing!"}
{"text":"The best noodle soup (canh bún)  I've ever had! Vietnamese.. If you don't try \"Canh Bún\" @VIET BISTRO. You're missing out in life!"}
{"text":"Great little find with good prices and lots of food. The pho broth was nicely flavored and the egg rolls delicious. We also had the seafood crispy egg noodle which was very well made, with a nice assortment of seafood and veges, and just enough sauce to drench the noodles in.  My only complaint is that the bahn mi do not come with pate. Note this place isn't a great sit down restaurant because there really is no ambience.  Happy eatings."}
{"text":"I can't stop eating at this place!!!!  The owner, Kevin, is awesome and each time I try something new, I fall in love.  I never liked Pho and wasn't going to start now with so many other choices for me.  However my husband ordered Pho on this trip and GUESS WHO IS GETTING PHO NEXT TIME.  This man is a genius with his use of spices and flavors."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice menu choices, good customer service, food taste good, and reasonable price. Far from the house but glad I made  the right choice of having lunch here."}
{"text":"I only come here for Pho. Their Pho is the best in town. Beef soup delicious. Much better than Saigon's Noodle. Staff are friendly. The place is clean and spacious. Service is fast for Pho, not sure for other dishes though. I've tried pho in Kim's Noodle and it was far from comparable to Vietbistro's now. I think this really depends on the chef."}
{"text":"Food and service = aca-awesome  The food is great. I ordered a simple pork on cold noodle kind of dish.  Usually these tastes all the same for me but their meat was different and just GOOD.  Server was very nice and fast.  When i walked in the door i saw the \"people like us on yelp\" sign and i was like SURE. I know good vietnamese food so we'll see. And ok yeah i LOVE this place.  The ambiance is nice the only thing is the cigar smell due to the cigar shop. So if u can't take the smell, order take out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come at least once a week with a co worker. Great food, close enough to being authentic. Don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown for pho. The owner is so sweet and prompt."}
{"text":"have only had their pho and iced coffee thus far but both have been delightful! Prompt and friendly service. Yummy, delicious pho! Will be coming here for my Vietnamese food kick from here on out!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the Pho might be a more accurate, given that the broth seems to lack the sort of depth that top shelf Pho normally boasts...but it's a solid choice on cold winter days, for sure. On the plus side, it comes out fast and the small portion is a good option for those not looking for a Super Bowl of Pho..."}
{"text":"Food is soooo good, Tanya is awesome she remembers what you ordered from your last visit. I come here at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"Love there fresh spring rolls. Big portions, cheap prices. The pork noodle bowl is also great!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent & food presentation is a work of art! Friendly customer service & will definitely come back again next time I am in vegas:)"}
{"text":"My favorite pho is served in Houston... But that changed after I discovered this Vietnamese restaurant a bit over a year ago.  It has the best P1 (Special Combination) in the whole world!!!  :-)  You should be willing to drive as long as it takes to get here because it is just worth it.  I have been to at least 3/4 of the Las Vegas/ Henderson Vietnamese restaurants and THIS is the place to beat.  Thank you and Happy Viet!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times... Environment:Smells bad. It's next door to a smoke shop. Overwhelmed with cigar smell. Decor:Typical Vietnamese decor. Staff member:Friendly. Food: Average. combination Vermicelli,spring rolls,eggs,combination pho. Items that I've order in the past.  Nothing unique or special..Nevertheless,it's decent Vietnamese food in the west part of Vegas (Summerlin). Would I return? Yes... But for the best PHO.....you can try Side Street Grill....or make the commute to Spring Mountain.  I wish they would relocated to another open spot in this strip mall. That Cigar shop deprives me of a good dining experience. Yuck"}
{"text":"We have a coupon from restaurants.com for Viet Bistro and we didn't know that it was only good for the Viet Bistro on Grand Canyon not Lake Mead. But since we drove all the way here already, we just ate here. I got the Chicken Sandwich. They usually make the sandwich with dark meat chicken, and I asked if I could change it to white meat, and the lady said yes. So, really happy about that. However, the amount of filling the sandwich had was so little. I wished they could've put more meat and vegetables. But the flavor was really good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm happy a Vietnamese place opened up on my side of town and an excellent one at that! The pho is great yummy and tasty! Spring rolls are amazing! Vermicelli bowls out of this world! And the service is very humble and friendly. I'm happy to bring my business here. I don't have to go all the way to China Town now! If you want authentic Vietnamese and food that you will want to come back to get more, go here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more, but after ordering twice I don't know if I'll be going back. A few issues were that other than the female who takes the orders on the phone, the male workers weren't very friendly when I came to pay, no smile our anything. That was off putting to me. Regarding the food, I ordered the ban mi and there was hardly and meat or veg on the sandwich, basically leaving me with 3/4 bread sandwich. The second day I ordered the grilled pork with rice noodles and Viet summer spring roll. It was good but very greasy. Overall the taste was good but the quality for price was lacking."}
{"text":"I am a huge Vietnam food person and I am super picky when it comes to good pho, I loved this place, the prices are decent and the pho was very delicious! You get a good amount of food and the veggies are fresh, however, there is a cigar store next door which made the restaurant a little stuffy, it took me a bit to adjust but overall I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"1st time here on a fri night at 8pm...  i did not want to drive to Pho 1 on spring mtn road, which has the best pho in town, this place is a bit over priced as expected for this side of town, the spring rolls were better here but they could have used a bit more mint, and pickled carrot & dicon, to much lettuce and the pork was not seasoned like mom's... but this place will do when your  exausted and don't want to drive to spring mountian.  The place is very clean, the broth for the pho could have been better but it is better than most places in town, the sandwich i had was the combination sandwich which had good flavor but a french baguette would have been better than the pale colored bread they gave me... this place is extremely clean, just needs a little help on refining their flavors wuth a few minor changes... Pho 1 is still my prefered place for food."}
{"text":"Service was very good! The waiter was very courteous!   But the food was very bad! I ordered a Shrimp Bun and it was burnt. And sometimes I felt as I have I had sand in my mouth because of the burnt shrimp.  Just ate there today. Hope this will help the fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Its been a good minute since we've had a good bowl of pho and the fams were craving it pretty hard.  So off to Yelp I go trying to find a pho spot close to home and Yelp led us here.  Now, I wasn't too impressed with the reviews, but you gotta understand, the food choices that we have up north are pretty limited.  But we decided to take a chance.    First off, as soon as we walked in, it smelled like smoke, as if someone was smoking inside.  That was a turnoff right then and there.  Even the teenager was wondering why it smelled like smoke.  We should have left but we stayed cause we were starving.  The customer service that we received could have been better.  The lady didn't give us our menus til 5 minutes after we sat down.  She got me and my son's order wrong and kept INSISTING we ordered a different item.  So I obviously was not happy with the service we received.  Now the pho, the broth was plain, didn't have much flavor in it.  I pretty much had to drown it with a ton of lime, sriracha and hoisin sauce.  The rest of the fams weren't too impressed either.  Bottom line, if we are ever craving for pho, we'll just make the trip down to Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"We went here a couple days ago, I wasn't very impressed. The decor of the place is cute, VERY purple and very personal, small mom & pop type of place. The water tasted weird but we're in Vegas and all the water I taste EVERYWHERE tastes like a weird mineral deposit, so what do I know.  On to the actual food:  I ordered beef & vermicelli noodles. Pretty good standard fare, beef tasted good, etc. The sauce was a little less flavorful than I'm used to and overall I'd say it was average verging on good. My partner ordered beef pho. She has low standards but I've gotta say this pho was pretty strange. The broth tasted unusually of cinnamon and the beef was FULL of fat & incredibly overcooked. She was picking the huge amounts of bad cuts of meat out of her bowl the entire night (like literally, strings and gobs of beef fat). I totally get that the beef in pho is supposed to be softer than normal beef, but seriously this stuff was so overcooked it was vaguely gummy and would've been best appreciated by someone with no teeth.  Overall I'd say average/not-so-good. Might not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent choice if you want great tasting Pho and a large portion even with the regular size. Lots of noddles, steak and meatballs yum!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this place, giving it a try. I ordered pho noodle soup to go. Nice place inside, and the staff is pleasant, humble, the aroma is a plus! By all means of authentic vietnamese restaurant, which is a very good sign. I got my order pretty fast.  Right after went home, opened my pho and it was well conveniently prepared; came with to-go chopsticks, that were not the break apart kind, the sauces were not tear packets either actually it was inside little capsules, well size chopped vegetables. Reminded me how it would taste, smell, prepared like how it would at a usual vietnamese friends house. Looking forward to taste the sandwiches here, and actually sitting down to eat here, deserves to be near the strip. I definitely recommend this place out of all the area if u want authentic, lovely sit down dinner for vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Been here in Vegas for 2 years and been looking everywhere for pho this made me smile the broth is amazing and I love the atmosphere good people running it. Each bite was warm and comforting best I've had out here."}
{"text":"It's a family owned place. The service is very friendly and quick. Everything I've had there has been delicious."}
{"text":"It used to be so pho king delicious!  But on my way to the ladies room I peeked in the kitchen which only has a little curtain,  and Omg!!  It was so dirty,  it smelled like decomposing fish and the counter tops where completely covered in dirty dishes and pots.  I'm never ever coming back.  Grosssssss."}
{"text":"Update: Let's just say this is my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  I've been there about 8 times now...the owners said I'm a regular, so that's a good sign.  They have so many delicious dishes.  They will stop by and mention items to try that aren't on the menu.  The food is always fresh, scrumptious, and priced right.  I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"There has never been a bowel of pho I didn't like....until now. The pho tasted like dish water, I kept smelling urine from where I was sitting, the spring rolls tasted like the meat had gone bad and gentlemen that bring out the orders were awkward. They brought out the orders and when I said thank you not even a head nod of acknowledgement. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place has the the worst chicken pho ever! It's salty and MSG out and they used shredded white chicken meat for the white ppl...it is not authentic at all. Yuk!! Small bowl for 10 bucks ....no thank you!"}
{"text":"The tofu bun was beyond my expectations. The bahn mi with tofu was good too, for 5.50 couldn't beat that. We will definitely come back and try the pho next time. Spring rolls were fab, With herbs and peanut sauce.mmnn all good"}
{"text":"Food was bad. Beansprout very old.  Lime in water old until change color . No customer there but nobody refill water . Hot sauce cup so dirty ."}
{"text":"My husband and I got the Pho with beef, egg rolls, and Bun Thit Nuong (spelling)... It was sooooo good! I loved all of its natural flavors with the peanuts and all the fresh herbs. Everything was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Location is clean, service is polite and prompt. I like how they use blue film covers over the fluorescent overhead lighting to keep it from being too harsh, gives the dining room almost a lounge atmosphere.  But the food. Salt and pepper calamari order was $7 for 14 grease-soaked pieces, without any salt or pepper. Very bland, only tasted like grease, served with cups of sweet and sour sauce? Best part was the random pieces of fried carrot used as garnish.  The \"special combination\" bahn mi, with a smiley-face next to it on the menu, was a huge disappointment. Meat was all stacked on one end of the sandwich. I opened it up to distribute it evenly, only to find several blackened pieces of meat- the type of coloration that looks like food that has gone bad, not blackened from cooking. Picked out several pieces, then bit in, only to encounter some crazy spicy sauce or seasoning that was so strong it made my eyes water. All I could see were jalapenos (one piece on the entire sandwich?), and I don't mind those.   This place may be right next to my gym, and the pho may be delicious, but I will not be coming back. If you can't reliably serve unspoiled cooked meat on your sandwiches, I am not going to trust the meat cooked in your soups."}
{"text":"A little hidden treasure. My first Vietnamese food experience. The gentlemen, whom I presume is the owner, is wonderful. He taught us how to eat the egg rolls, even though I took a guess and wound up doing it right, I certainly appreciated the tutorial. I know he want to just wrap it up for me, but that would have been a bit awkward. Helpful, none the less. We ordered the egg rolls and fried wontons. We got egg roles and fried chicken wings. I know they sound the same. Fried. Oh well, we decided to keep them and they were good. I'd suggest, if this sort of thing would bother you, to speak clearly and point at what you want on the menu. We just rolled with it. I love that Viet is close to home. We also got there just before dinner rush, another plus. The portions (I noticed food is mostly served in bowls) are generous. For me, enough for leftovers. DING! Another plus. My shrimp and crab meat udan was amazing. I think I heard some angels sing. The flavor is so delicious. A new fav to add to my list and I know that this place will come in handy if I ever have a cold, that's for sure. I vow to eat pho, the next visit. Oh, and the gentlemen also gave us a little lesson on kimchi, because I asked if it asked Vietnamese which it isn't.  It's Korean, and I knew that, so I had a derp moment quickly followed up by getting my lesson and partial recovery from said derp moment. Anyhoo, I adore soup, and this is now my noodle soup heaven. Thank you, Viet Bistro, I shall return. Oh, yeah!I forgot to mention that they serve sandwiches!!! #houseofyum"}
{"text":"I regularly come to this restaurant during lunch hour. There is never a wait and the food comes out in a very timely manner. I have ordered multiple items from the menu and the quality is very good! I generally order the special pho \"P1\", it is so good! The regular size bowl of pho is enough to satisfy your hunger craving. However, if you are really hungry, I would recommend ordering the larger bowl of pho. The food is tasty and the staff is very friendly. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Come here most of the time because it's conveniently close to my home. Been a fan of this location since last year when my sister introduced it to me. Hahaha... Of course, I go more frequently in the fall and winter for their Pho. My usual is the Brisket and Flank Steak Pho. Once in awhile, I'll order the Seafood. My siblings enjoy their Banh Mis, especially the Special Combination. We'll also order the Fresh Spring Rolls that come with peanut sauce.  Like their Thai Tea with Boba in the spring and summer. We recently got to try their coffee with sweet condensed milk - that was certainly different. I recommend stirring it before every sip, otherwise it clots at the bottom of the cup. It's weird how the milk only lightened the bitter coffee taste most places mask.  Anyway, service is always friendly and efficient. They always check on their patrons at least once during the meal, which is fine by us 'cause we don't ask a for a lot whenever we stop by. Hahaha... We just order our entire usual meal at the beginning, then ask for the bill and boxes at the end. Exceptions are whenever we order something to go for the family after my sister and I have a lunch date or something, and they never make us feel like it's a hassle."}
{"text":"Late review but I returned get more tasty pho and I was a little disappointed. They never have glass noodles and when I ordered extra veggies all I got was carrots. Broth was still tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped by last Saturday night for some soup, as I had a bit of a cold and wanted some chicken noodle soup... but who says it has to be BORING chicken noodle soup?   Woohoo for Pho!  I got the chicken Pho and hubby got the combo Pho - and we were both amazed at how incredibly good it was.  I started feeling better from the first bite/slurp!  I haven't tried ALL the Pho shops in town, so consider that when I say.. this was, by far, the best Pho ever!  Service was attentive, the take-out for the leftovers was nicely packaged, and very affordable & excellent food.  Will I return?  Totally, and soon!"}
{"text":"The place is small but clean.  Good service and friendly staff.  The food is OK, just your standard fare. I was disappointed that there wasn't enough tripe and tendons in my soup.  Definitely geared towards non-Vietnamese palates."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurants that I have ever been to.  The service was horrible.  We ran out of water and the waiters went outside to smoke and there was no one in the restaurant to serve us water or check up on us.  We could've got away without paying off we wanted to.   Then there is the food. We had the fresh spring rolls which was just ok.  The Pho had no flavor, the Curry Rice was bland, and the ribs had a lot of fat and was very tough. The bill came to $42 and was not worth the money we spent.  Go to PHO VIETNAM GRILLE  EXPRESS  on Durango & Spring Mt.  The service was great and the prices are Very Reasonable and the food tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is ok compared to some other pho establishments, customer service is great. The great perk is I don't have to drive all the way to China town."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love that they made a second location (lakemead and rainbow) pho is amazing! Everything is amazing love the decor, smells clean! The owner is warm, welcoming, friendly and kind! We will be regulars in this location too!"}
{"text":"Pho is quite tasty. Tendon is properly cooked and soup is hot enough to cook the rare eye round beef.  Men's room is disgusting and was out of hand soap and paper towels. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is ...  English is a challenge for the staff."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends for lunch on Sunday. Sadly, I came away with my expectations unfulfilled.  Service was rather lacking and slow. They seemed to be understaffed, with only 2 servers catering to the 15 or so tables during lunch hour.   The menu was interesting, with loads of familiar Vietnamese dishes ranging from noodles to rice dishes, and Chinese stir-fried dishes.   As recommended by fellow Yelpers, I went ahead and ordered Vietnamese favorite - Pho with meatballs. I got a large bowl, which was a dollar more expensive than the regular, hoping to go home with leftovers for another meal (which is what happens at Ha Long Bay and Saigon noodles). Sadly, for $9, I got noodles only enough for one meal, and 3 half meatballs. The soup was tasty, but I wouldn't say it was better than Ha Long Bay and Saigon noodles. Definitely I would lean towards the rice dishes next time.  Also, I'm excited to hear they would be serving Dim Sum, which is horribly lacking in Madison. Noticing that there were cantonese among the servers gives me a spark of hope that this would be a reasonable place to assuage my hunger for Dim Sum in Madison!"}
{"text":"I was greeted and seated promptly. Ordered special pho combo p1 and it was out in less than 3 minutes hot and delicious. Very impressive! The cigar smell is annoying but they can't do much about that as the neighboring shop is a cigar bar. Price is right. No complaints! I shall return."}
{"text":"This my place for BUN BO HUE! The broth is rich, flavorful & hearty. Good bun bo hue is hard to find in Vegas.   Something unique is that they offer this traditionally beef-based soup in seafood & veggie versions. Very smart!   They have a good selection for seafood lovers & noodle lovers like myself. However, I only get the bun bo hue!!  SERVICE: The lady at the counter is really nice."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 but I will round down due to the cigar stench from the smoke shop next door.  I understand it is not the restaurant's fault, but it doesn't change the fact that it is unpleasant.  It is fairly spacious inside with a very standard, devoid of personality type decor. The service can be hit or miss, but even on the \"hit\" day it's the bare minimum consisting of a water refill.  The pho is actually good. The broth is flavorful and they do not skimp on the meat. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity of food that you get. On my last few visits I had their vermicelli with grilled pork and pork paste. The taste is ok and they do skimp on the meat. I ordered an extra side of grilled pork for my husband and I to share just because the few pieces that come standard get lost in the mix quickly. I still prefer the pho and vermicelli at Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern and 215, but this one is considerably closer to my house."}
{"text":"Owners are on site and very friendly.  Huge bowls of pho, the bahn mi's are on point.  SUPER fresh.  The prices are awesome!"}
{"text":"I AM OBSESSED. I do not eat Pho, I eat the fried rice. I would argue it is the best fried rice I have ever had. Now, sometimes the chef is heavy handed with the pepper. Just stir it and add soy sauce. Sometimes the chef puts way too much green onions in it too: I take the time to pick them off because it is so worth it.  The portion is HUGGGEEE. It's enough for 2 hungry people. Also, the beef fried rice (exactly what I get) has the beef very thinly sliced and just absolutely incredible. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. They do take out as well, but no delivery."}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese food I have EVER had in the Midwest. There is a new chef from  Hong Kong cooking the Chinese food.  Try the hot and sour soup and generals chicken."}
{"text":"The food and service was okay, just okay. I ordered the Spicy Beef Noodle soup. It was not spicy and they only added 2 pieces of meat. The service was really not so friendly. To quit for my taste. The only A+ was the delicious ginger lemonade."}
{"text":"Decent pho place for not having to drive to Spring Mountain. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"After reading through the reviews this place ended up being such a disappointment. I ordered the Pho Ga to go and the moment I stepped into the restaurant all I could smell was cigarette. It smelled like an old run down bar. It was incredibly unappetizing but still since I had ordered it to go I figured the actual meal might be worth it. Not exactly. To start, all the add ins (sprouts, jalapeños, limes) were all old and dusky. The chicken smelled and tasted sour so I didn't add it into my Pho. The noodles were about the only appetizing thing and the broth was ok, but nothing I would go back again for."}
{"text":"Service was terrible . Took 15 minutes to even get our drinks. Food was decent.   Chicken and Shrimp friend rice 2/5 the rice tasted like it only consisted of soy sauce and salt.   Pho tai bo vien 3.5/5 broth lacked flavor but it was above average pho   Bunh bo hue 4/5 after squeezing a bunch of lime it was the best thing we ordered that night.   Overall experience 3/5 bad service when it wasn't really busy and average food"}
{"text":"Their Porkchop, with rice, and egg on top, salad and extra dipping sauce is BOMB! I always order here for Take Out. Never dined in. I give this place 4 stars because previously, when I ordered here in the past, it took them ALMOST a whole hour of waiting to deliver the food to my house. I was disappointed, but I didn't expect to wait that long, for delivery, regardless if it was crazy/busy that day. By far, it's a good spot for Vietnamese food! Mmmmm..mmmm."}
{"text":"I don't like to leave bad reviews but I think I need to. Tried this place for the first time yesterday. When I walked in, the restaurant was completely empty. I sat down and ordered fresh spring rolls, pho and chicken fried rice. The pho was OK, but the garnish plate (mint leaves,bean sprouts, and jalapeños) looked not fresh and stale. Spring rolls were kinda hard and not that tasty as well as chicken in the fried rice. But that wasn't the worst part of my experience. Somewhere in the middle of my meal I went to use a restroom and OMG... it was absolutely disgusting! Dirt everywhere! I don't think they ever washed their toilet or sink. My appetite was gone, I couldn't take another bite after I saw that. I will not be coming back there for sure."}
{"text":"been looking for a good pho place to eat and finally one not to far from my house. This place is nice n clean and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Ok I was a little wary of this location because of the area but its right by crossfit so I thought what the heck! I haaattteee cigars. I was wondering in the reviews why everyone was talking about a cigar smell. Next door is a cigar shop. But i surprisingly didn't mind!  It did blend w the smell of the food. But the cigars smelled good. Idk maybe O got lucky if you hate hate cigars dont go.   I took a few opinions from my yelp queens and kings and my boyfriend and I both only got pho. I always get veggie tofu and he got beef and shrimp in spicy peanut butter broth. Mine was really good. Firm tofu the broth was super good and close to pho citis broth that I was obsessed w in LA. I was really happy with it. My boyfriends was sooooo good the broth is spicy so beware. But the peanut butter really came through. And 7 shrimps in there! Surprising. My boyfriend who is a chef said few things while be was eating but one of them.was, \"this is the real deal!\" I enjoyed the atmosphere of the light and dark purples. We got a ginger lemonade iced tea w mint! Yummmmm ! Really really good."}
{"text":"a random pick restaurant, turn out to be a BOMB place to eat authentic Vietnamese Cuisine2 thumbs up especially the SHRIMP & CRAB MEAT UDON NOODLE SOUP"}
{"text":"Can I just say I am so happy that theres a vietnamese restaurant near my house! The service is great, lots more english than chinatown! I had the combo Pho bowl and the fried egg rolls, yum yum yum... the thai tea is also spot on! give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The place is huge but was not full, so the service could have been *much* better. There was a line waiting to sit when I got there, even though there were many empty tables. I was by myself and where they put me the waiter didn't see me easily so I had to wait about 10 minutes to get any service even after sitting. A different server brought my food and it was not what I ordered. I had shrimp spring rolls and the special beef pho. The spring rolls were pretty bland but the peanut sauce that accompanied them was very good. I had never had pho before, but I didn't like it. I don't know if that was their fault or if I just don't like pho. I had to wait in line again to pay. I wish I'd read the one other review before I went!"}
{"text":"I've been at this place a few times. Friendly, prices are good. Everything we had was great! Def one of our go to places if I ever want Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I was actually headed to Panera bread but it was packed so I decided to come here instead and I am so glad I did. When I first came there was only a couple eating and I was greeted right away. Was seated by a very warm host and peeped the menu. Everything looked really good but I wasn't in the mood for pho. I find bahn mi at the back of the menu! Theo lay other bahn mi I've had was from mr. Sandwhich and it wasn't the best. I ordered the BBQ bahn mi and my drink arrived right away. The hostess was also my waitress, super attentive. Very helpful with questions about the food. 4 other parties were sat.  My food came out within 5 minutes after my drink had arrived. Piping hot! This is the best bahn mi I've ever had. It's served with a tasty broth. The waitress/hostess kept checking on me. Perfect! I will deff return."}
{"text":"No, I don't think so.  Barely any meat and the broth was plain, plain, plain. I had to add lime, basil, soy sauce and chili sauce and jalapenos just for the broth to have any flavor.  Friendly staff, large portion."}
{"text":"I tried the Bun Bo Hue for the first time. It was different since the meat was cooked in lemongrass broth. It was quite tasty, however watch out for the splashes because the stains can scare you if you are wearing light colored clothing! I also ordered shrimp spring rolls for my appetizer which was refreshing and not too heavy.   The only drawback of this place is the smoke smell from the cigar store next to the restaurant. I would also suggest revamping or remodeling the interior to bring in more traffic. These are a few of the reasons for my 4 star. Other than that friendly service and welcoming staff. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Good place to come for Pho.  Everything was good including the flan for dessert :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered egg rolls and a small bowl of pho as a post-dinner snack. After trying both, I was more excited about the egg rolls than I was about our pho. The broth is oily and thin, not collageny, the noodles were soft, not chewy, and the round steak, perhaps not sliced thin enough, was a little tough.  The French press coffees, both iced and hot, with condensed milk were the best versions of Vietnamese coffee I've had in Madison, and I've ordered this everywhere. At a hefty price of $3.50 a mug though, I might be better off making this myself at home.   Service was nice, if a little detached. The booth I was sitting in was super wobbly when another couple sat down behind me so I had to move to the other side and eat next to my dining companion. Cute or awkward?"}
{"text":"Best Bun Bo Hue on this planet!!! Homemade and done the right way! Love this place and we will  be back again. Try their calamari it is really da bomb!!! One of my new favorite vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Drove here for dinner and they closed at 8:50.   If you are going to list your hours till 9p stay open till then.   I wouldn't have wasted my time driving over here."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place numerous times and this is the best place to eat pho in the NLV area. I feel like it deserves a review now since ive experienced some very lack luster pho experience on my side of town.   The service is friendly fast. I received my pho in less than 5 min. Its always clean and theres room for a family of 5. Prices are decent and size value is decent as well. Could better but beggers cant be choosers up here at NLV:  Their fried rice is also decent, great taste and decent size. This is definitely a 3.5/5 kind of place but im giving them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Had to up mine to 5 big ones just because the service is so great. Since the baby we have been coming more often because they are so accomodating. Love this place and the staff."}
{"text":"After reading the yelp review, I decided to give this place a try since it's super close to my house. The only two things that I have tried were bun bo hue and pork spring rolls. The pork spring rolls were okay, but bun bo hue became my fav. bun bo hue in vegas :) My only complaint about this place is the lighting, it feels weird inside and makes my eyes uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I have eaten here and gotten carry out in the past. It was pretty good. I don't know what happened today but we got carry out and the broth was horrible. It didn't even look like pho broth. It was more dirty dish water looking, not hot and was bland and watery. Yucky Yucky"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. The waitress never checked up on us or anything. Place was dead. We ate here last night. Why serve hot ginger lemon tea but it come cold. The tea itself had a strange bathroom like taste and it was nowhere near hot. So we asked to exchange it for hot tea. Food was alright but i feel they skimp on the meats."}
{"text":"Warning! Do NOT eat here. Just now, My daughter found dark black pubic hairs in our pho! I have eaten here before and never ever will again- we are grossed out and can't believe anyone would be this disrespectful and unsanitary! Thank God we hadn't eaten much of it!   My hair is dark red and my daughters dirty blonde, so it wasn't our hair- nor anyone living with us! So sad!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice for the vegetable and tofu pho with veggie broth. The place smells like cigars, and the bathroom is dirty. As a vegan, I was concerned because they told me I was getting the Veggie broth, which costs .50 extra, but they never put it on the bill. They didn't seem to understand the concept of no animal products. So, I really didn't enjoy the dining experience.  Also the pho tasted inconsistent between bowls. If you are a vegetaran or vegan, or enjoy a semblance of sanitation, I recommend passing on this one."}
{"text":"Tried this place mid week for lunch. I ordered n6, which you can see from my photo was delicious."}
{"text":"It is confirmed that the restaurant is closed by the owner. However, joe the dim sum chef has been courted to viet hoa in Monona. He has great plans for his kitchen there. Can't wait to review the new location. Goodbye to this location, hello to something new."}
{"text":"Spring Mountain's endless road of reasonably priced Pho restaurants just made it's way up to to the North West.  And it's about time!  I waited with baited breath for this restaurant to open in one of my favorite plazas adorned with Panera, Chipotle, Cupcakery, and Market Grille Cafe, already a great offering of casual dinner spots.  It finally opened and I managed to get in around 1:30PM for lunch, after running a few errands.    The interior is very purple, with fresh flowers, tinted lights, and a closed off kitchen.  Comfortably seating 31 people, it's a somewhat intimate space.  There would three other tables there, two of which were Vietnamese diners.  (Which is always a good sign.)  I was greeted with a bit longer of a menu than I expected, (Not Pho Kim Long's length or anything like that, about five pages of offerings.)  I went with the generic route of ordering Spring Rolls and a basic \"everything\" bowl of Pho.  The Pho: Very good.  Not salty at all.  Came out lightening quick, and has a good balance of noodles vs. meat.    Spring Rolls: Really good.  Flavorful, crispy yet moist on the inside with a really nice garnish presentation.    The girl who owns it was very friendly and was ready to make a few recommendations for me on what to order.  I went with a very generic choice since i kind of wanted to get a baseline of what the quality was before I ordered the \"house specialties\", not to mention that I wasn't terribly hungry so I didn't want to overload with appetizers and soup and etc.    I am of the opinion that like all businesses, they're somewhat new with the service so it's going to take a bit to get running super smooth, (i.e. my appetizer came out the same time as my Pho, which made me feel a little rushed), but all good things take time.    I hope things do well for Viet Bistro as it's pretty good food with friendly service at an excellent price without the drive to Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Upon entering this establishment, you get a huge whiff of cigarette smoke, which was absolutely disgusting to me. Luckily the smell went away rather quickly.  We were greeted and seated immediately upon arrival. The service here is pretty fast. Shortly after ordering, our food was brought out to us. The pho here was pretty good, but then again I had a massive hangover when I ate here. Although the portion sizes were decent, I was disappointed in the amount of meath they included. They also charge more than some of the other pho places I've been to.  Overall, the food isn't bad and they do have good customer service."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in Viet Bistro. I ordered carry out. The wait wasn't long (10 min) on a friday evening.   I ordered the tofu spring rolls and tofu Pho. Both dishes were amazing.   The staff was very nice and accommodating.   The small diner was clean but cold (wear a jacket if you plan on eating there).   The menu prices were resonable.  I am very happy with my first experience at this location and highly recommend if you love Vietnamese  food."}
{"text":"Been to plenty of Pho restaurants and this is by the best Pho in town!!! Not to mention they are SO nice and have great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food!  The broth for the Pho is sooo good!  My boys killed their Vietnamese sandwiches"}
{"text":"Took a star off because the last couple times I've been here the banh mi quality hasn't been as good."}
{"text":"Great service. The waitress remembers us every time. Love it here!!! Really good pho! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The prices were about $2 more than in Chinatown, and although it is closer to our house, the pho broth does not cut it. The broth is underflavored and a bit too sweet. The noodles in the XL bowl are not enough and the spring rolls lacked meat and noodles.  The service was not friendly, and the place was so quiet, it was eerie."}
{"text":"Ever since our friend recommended this place me n my girlfriend have been coming here ever since... Jus overall we love this place..."}
{"text":"My go-to for Vietnamese in my work area!  I tried another place that definitely was not impressive, so then I tried THIS place and I am certainly satisfied.  It's a cute little place inside a VERY busy shopping strip, so I'd suggest parking in the back rows.  (The hike won't kill you, I promise.)  Prices are pretty average and both times I've ordered rice vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls for pick-up.  Fast and Deeeeeelicious!  Sadly, though, there was no sriracha or hoisin sauce.  I don't usually get them in my to-go bag anywhere, though.  =(  Accepts cards with no minimum (hey, this is a plus) and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the pho #p6 which was sirloin and it probably has the most delicious broth I've ever tasted! The service was great and very responsive to drink refills and checking on our satisfaction.  My wife and I think this is gonna be our regular spot."}
{"text":"Pho joint in near Summerlin with mostly white clientele..... The shrimp and crab udon was pretty good, I have to admit. Lots of crab and the noodles did not get soggy or soft towards the end of the meal.  However, the bun bo hue was disappointing. The pork hocks were way under done. They are supposed to be tender and fall off the bone. I took a bite and couldn't even get a bite off! I had to pull it off with my hands. The broth wasn't spicy either. The noodles were good though.  We also got the shrimp spring rolls. It's two rolls cut in half and it has the thinnest piece of shrimp paste I have ever seen. Must have been less than 1/4\" thick for $6. Major rip off.  Plus the disgusting smell from the cigar shop next door. I won't be coming back. Kinh Do is much better!"}
{"text":"it was the night of the 'geeks who drink hunger games pub quiz' and we thought we should fuel up beforehand. viet bistro ended up being our choice because of proximity.  i ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and the pho with tendon and brisket. the spring rolls were tasty as was the dipping sauce it came with. the pho was good but the broth was far too sweet for me. i prefer a rich beef broth with a little herbiness but mostly beef flavor. i do know some people who prefer their broth sweeter, others saltier, so i think their broth would be just right for certain people.  the hubby had the banh mi which was basically just bread with a sprinkling of meat and veg inside. it was a pretty sad little sandwich.  i would definitely return to give them another shot. i might not be a fan of their pho broth but i'm sure they have something else i might like."}
{"text":"This place is a little whole in the wall tucked into a shopping strip. I stumbled upon this little gem the other day while craving something different. I ordered a big ol' bowl of Pho and it was huuuuuge!!! Never the less i devoured it, and even had left overs for later! Its a great place, the lady doesnt speak much english so it takes a bit of sign language and pointing at the menu to order but great food. Im happy this place is right around the corner from my house and i dont have to venture to china town for some good pho"}
{"text":"Met my sister here for lunch. We both ordered Pho. Me the chicken my sister the Beef. I thought it was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but tasty. We will probably go back. Only downer is that it's next to a smoke shop and the smell came though the walls. Smelled like a rotten cigar."}
{"text":"This places is a hidden gem! There are NO other close pho places and their ginger lemonade tea is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Decided to try Viet Bistro because I wanted to find a pho place closer to home instead of always having to drive down to Chinatown. This hole in the wall is definitely not worth another visit because the pho broth was mediocre and pretty bland, and the people working here don't speak much English and won't understand your order no matter how many times you say it while pointing at the item on the menu.  When we first walked into the restaurant, it seemed really dark and smokey. Rachel S and I were seated at a small table but I asked to be moved because they gave us the wobbliest table possible. To buy time to review the menu, I told the lady that we would start with an A8 (nem nuong cuon) while pointing direclty at \"A8\" on the menu. She seemed to have trouble understanding me so I repeated it multiple times while continuing to point at it. When our appetizer was brought out, it was like a bowl of noodles or something and I told them they had the wrong table because we didn't order that. She told me that I had said N8 right?...NO! WTF! How can you possibly get it wrong when I was pointing at A8 and repeating it about 100 times! The lady contested me and didn't believe me until she brought me the menu back and I showed her what A8 was.  At least our pho was made correctly but the broth was bland and tasteless. I added a bunch of hoisin sauce which helped a little, but that broth definitely needed a lot of help. The meat and noodles were fine. Just wished the bowl contained a little less steak and more tripe and tendon...because the bowl I ordered was supposed to have all 3 but all I saw was 1 piece of tripe and tendon and a ton of steak.  When our nem nuong cuon finally came out, it was ok. Definitely not the best although it still tasted good. They use cucumbers for crunch instead of egg roll shell crumbles like Nem Nuong Bistro/Brodard. Go there instead, especially because it's the same price at 2 for $4.95"}
{"text":"The Pho was hot and delicious.  Loved, loved, loved it!  Also tried the BBQ pork sandwich.  Although my husband liked the pho (his first time, my second) he was really taken with the sandwich.  The service here is tremendous.  The servers are so friendly, they walk around the place smiling.  I'll be going here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Really Amazing! The man there took the time to talk about Hue and Bun Hue the soup with us. It was a nice experience for what was just a quick lunch. The bun hue soup was spectacular. I always dump hoisin and sriracha in pho but this didn't need anything."}
{"text":"Had been here before,but it had been awhile. All I could remember was that they didn't serve wine. Wanted Pho quick without going to China town and thought I would give this place another try. Big mistake! We were the only two people there at about 3:30pm. I'm in the service industry so l really try not to big bother to the waiters. Our server/host was on his computer and I had to finally flag him down to take our order. Didn't write it down, ok, some people have a good memory. Order comes,it's shrimp pho. Since we are vegan, that really doesn't work for us. No problem,  mistakes are made was my thinking. Must add that we ordered the tofu xo as a appetizer and it was excellent. But, when are entrees arrived again we had asked for a fork instead of chopsticks for my Mom. Finally, we got them after asking for the third time. Must I remind you that we are the only ones in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the main entree did not make up for the poor service. Vegetable tofu pho was very bland. I ended adding way to much chili sauce to get flavor. Way to much hot power.(my bad) Had to ask for water because of course it wasn't provided when we sat down. Couldn't finish the rest.  I'm sure regular pho would have more flavor though. Two other young women came in later and they were served water and order was taken promptly. I contribute this to the change in staff. The older gentleman, though very friendly, didn't seem to care about the product. Service. I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"My pho was horrible my Brussels sprouts where old also my mints . The lady in front desk was sooo rude ... I can't believe in June 1 18 there was no air conditioning... the floors where dirty too ."}
{"text":"The bun bo hue is not good which is what I normally taste test at a new Vietnamese place. But I'll come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Eh...mediocre at best...first and last visit..no smoking (although you are smacked in the face with cigar stench from next door), no chicken satay, no hot teas, no ambiance; ordered pho tai and got mostly noodles, very limited small pieces of beef and even less veggies.."}
{"text":"Can't give this place more than 1 Star. I was really hoping it was truly a Bistro Experience with OMG I gotta go there again & again food; but alas, another Ho Hum, forgettable, ethnic restaurant in Las Vegas. Soup was lukewarm, combination bowl meats were as well would never have passed the Health inspectors thermometer requiring hot food at 145 degrees or better. Curry was just Ok. Doesn't blow you away. Drive the extra miles to Chinatown or better yet, go to NY or SF for the real deal. Sorry. This isn't it."}
{"text":"I prefer the pho here to all the joints scattered throughout Spring Mountain Rd.  They have the tastiest broth in Vegas...not clear like several other places I won't bother mentioning.  You get fresh basil that isn't black & wilted & a good amount of meat in the soup.  My last few times eating pho in Chinatown, the basil was on it's last leg.  Also, I usually have to order extra sliced beef on the side...not so here.  They don't skimp on the dead cow flesh!    They know how to make good eggrolls, springrolls & banh mi as well!  Probably the best pho I've had since I've moved back to Vegas...still not as good as my spot in Seattle, but it will do for now."}
{"text":"Just ate here since we had passed it before it had opened and now wanted Vietnamese.  I would give it 4.5* if I could, but since I cannot, I give it 5.   They have a large menu, including Banh Mi, which is nice.  We ordered some rice vermicelli noodles, an order of shrimp summer rolls and an order of pork summer rolls, and I had a bbq pork banh mi.  The shrimp rolls were fine...no better or worse than any other place I have been to.  I really enjoyed the pork ones, as they had a nice bbq flavor to the pork.  My banh mi was very tasty and had a super fresh and soft baguette.  It was filled with a healthy assortment of vegetables and had a good taste as well as crunch factor.  The meat could have been a little more thick, as it just had one thin layer of the pork, basically the same as the summer rolls.  For $5.50 it came with a little soup cup, which was delicious.  It was hot and refreshing and I enjoyed it immensely.  They screwed up my banh mi by putting mayo after I asked them not to, and despite the fact that I had eaten half of it already before I really noticed (1 half was much heavier with mayo), they remade the whole thing for me.  The waitress was very nice and friendly, and I did not lack for water or beverage refills at all.  My wife enjoyed her noodles, especially the fried spring roll that came with it.    Overall, I thought it was a very solid meal and there are many other choices I want to try as well, including a beef roll wrapped in some kind of leaf.  The banh mi addition was nice, since I cannot often find too many banh mi places.  The food was pretty decently priced, and the service was good and friendly.  My sandwich was great and the rolls were pretty good too.  Overall, as I said, 4.5, but there were really not glaring faults and I would certainly return soon.  My new go to spot for Vietnamese in the NW part of town."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the food is pretty good. But make sure u give yourself enough time for lunch!!! I had bad service there three times I was there. 1st in only asked how long my carry out will be the guy was like\" do I see we have ppl here to service too?!?\" He answered. \" I just want to know how long it will take\" I replied. The 2nd time i figured I ordered over the phone but it took me 15 min for the manger/ owner to understand what u wanted!!! He barely speak English and have a heavy accent. Not very nice in the phone ! No customer sever skill! I ended up cancelled the ordered and re think if I will ever order from them again!!!!!!! Not recommended !"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy exploring new places to eat, particularly Asian, especially Vietnamese. Had heard about Viet Bistro and had it on my list of places to visit; my wife and I visited them wednesday at 3pm and had the place to ourselves being as we were between lunch and dinner.   I was quite happy to see the restaurant was clean, stylish with lots of food item pictures on the walls in deco art; overall, it was an inviting environment, relaxed and comfortable. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.   Was nice to find Banh Xeo on the menu, so I ordered that and a regular sized bowl of Pho Tai and a Thai Tea; my wife ordered the grilled chicken plate.    Water and the Thai Tea arrived promptly but the tea included boba .. I am not a fan of boba and would have preferred the option of excluding it.  The dishes did not arrive to the table at the same time...my Pho arrived first and the grilled chicken followed about 4 minutes later. So, I sat waiting for the chicken to arrive so as not to be eating alone while my wife waited. The beef in the Pho, usually served rare or raw, appeared to have been previously cooked - it was chewy and not tender, perhaps leftover from lunch. The soup was tasty all the same and had a nice appealing aroma!   With the arrival of the grilled chicken, it looked very good...albeit a bit over charred, nearly burnt. It was nearly half of a chicken with breast, leg and thigh, but a skinny bird in its previous life...not a lot of meat after cutting into it. Then, once inside, the meat was still bleeding in areas, not cooked thoroughly. Sigh.   Halfway thru our meals and expecting the Banh Xeo had been overlooked, our waiter came to us saying the batter for the Banh Xeo was bad and could not be used and asked if we wanted something else.    A bit pricey and disappointed for our first visit, but will give it another try eventually. Lots of others with more positive commenting here, so we will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Small but busy little spot. We enjoyed our lunch and topped it off with a Vietnamese coffee. We're ready for anything now!"}
{"text":"I would like to give a zero if I could. I used to come to this place a lot. I called over today to ask when they will close tonight. The guy told me 10 pm. I drove to the restaurant around 9:10. The restaurant literally closed!!!! Would not come to this place anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered the bar b que pork sandwich, but the bread was hard. Service was also slow and the food was mediocre. I used to eat Vietnamese food three times a week when I worked in Alhambra, CA and expected this place to be on the same level. I wasn't impressed. The mint lemonade, however was truly amazing. I would go there again just for a tall glass of that!"}
{"text":"I love pho and viet bistro is the best pho I ever had in Las Vegas. They have ox tail pho! the broth is so flavorful and portion size is good. I come here almost every week.  Try it out for yourself :) they have better customer service than the pho places in china town or near the strip."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch. It's a solid place to eat, but not amazing. It's hard to find decent asian food away from Spring Mtn area, so this place is a bit of a gem.   I usually order the vegetarian Pho, but sometimes they don't have vegetarian broth. As a vegetarian, the options here are limited, but my family likes the rest of the options.   Pho, curry, pork chops, all smell good and the family enjoys them. It's worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho. Being near by my place is a big plus. Would always want to go here whenever I am craving for pho. They have a thai with boba and is pretty good. Everything else is good."}
{"text":"Came here with excitement that it started to serve dim sum. We were kept waiting for 15 minutes before we were seated. There were open seats just that no one was in charge of cleaning things up. Weird. No utensils, no water, no one to take order after we were seated for 10 minutes.   The service is terrible. Slow. Understaffed. Uncoordinated. Obviously they were overwhelmed by dim sum lovers on a weekend. I could see the waitresses felt awkward, too.  Seriously, someone needs to fix the system here.  Finally came the dims sum carts. We chose five different items. They were all pretty good. However, many dishes were not warm enough because being on the cart for too long. They also have pan-fried noodles on the cart, which is not typical, at least that is the first time I've seen noodles on a cart in my life. I would guess they are too cold for anyone to enjoy.   Fear of kept waiting for even longer, we rushed to check out after having the first round of food. The owner explained to us that the slowness is due to the unexpected good business. I thought you should always be prepared when you run a restaurant.   Overall, the dim sum was actually pretty good, but the dining experience is so underwhelming. I would give Viet Bistro another chance when it is not as busy, hope it will not let me down again.   * on my first visit, I tried pho. It was okay, not as good as Saigon's. But if you crave for a noodle soup in central Madison, it is a passable place.   I think they seriously need to downsize its menu. Either focus on dim sum or Vietnamese food, or American Chinese food. There is no way to be a decent restaurant when playing three roles at once."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! The restaurant is very clean and the owners are incredibly friendly. One of my favorite places in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"No English at all, wonder how you running this restaurant , maybe a really Vietnamese restaurant? However, soup has no taste at all, had to put a lot sauce by myself, can't even read a VISA card?? Had to call someone to verify ??? Dropped a cash and run out of this place asap,I appreciate you bring the food for me but thank you never come back."}
{"text":"The pho was just mediocre. The thing i hate most was it was located next to the smoke shop. So the cigarette smoke bothered me the whole meal. The iced tea they used was weird. It tasted like coffee and tea. Oh, and the lighting was so dimmed that made me sleepy."}
{"text":"The good good: Quality meat used in the Pho One of the best Bahn Mi sandwiches Fresh spring rolls Fair pricing  The bad: Akward silence -  They should play music or something instead of it being so solemn. Carpaccio salad - meat was sliced to thick."}
{"text":"Thought of giving it a try since this is the only restaurant we haven't tried in the area they're in the same compound of  Chipotle, Panera, Canes etc.... First, they dont have a lunch special so we ordered and got a Large Pho for $11.00 and a Sandwich for $5.50. (meh, they're plain, a few slices of meat and dry) Pho was pretty descent but a bit pricey. $11.00 + tax + service charge  total around $14 for lunch? just the noodle soup and water. We love to eat Pho so we have a bunch of restaurants to compare it to.  So I thought of testing it out and asked the waiter if they charge for an extra soup Pho. yup they sure do! a small bowl of plain soup is around $3+ and a large is $5+.... now, that's unheard of! Some restaurants would charge  a dollar or two. but that's too greedy! So, Now I know I and tried the place and don't have to eat here again."}
{"text":"I was impressed with our lamb egg roles and pho. Service was fast and the staff were very kind. We will come back. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Location is super close. The pho was delicious. Not a fav of the Vietnamese sandwich. It didn't have a lot of the pickled veggies and the pate is chicken. I believe the sandwich I had in Chinatown had pork pate. The marinated grilled pork was a highlight. The server was friendly and answered all my questions. I didn't feel intimidated at all."}
{"text":"I love this place and have eaten here many times. Growing up in the Bay Area, I am use to great pho. This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I've found in Las Vegas (I've been searching). The staff is extremely welcoming and efficient, unlike Pho Rose up the street. I am always pleased and never been disappointed with the variety of dishes I've tried at Viet Bistro."}
{"text":"We usually go for lunch and I haven't noticed the cigar smell that many of the other reviews mention. The Vietnamese eggrolls are the best, especially with a bunch of mint.  Oxtail pho is one of my favorites.  And the seafood nest was a surprise.  I have been there probably 3 doz times and have never had something that was less than delicious."}
{"text":"Right off the bat was given a price over the phone for a carry out when I arrived was given a different price. Walking into this place no customers the place was empty so I could tell something was up. The lady needed money so gave me a different price and acting like she didn't know not too mention got me sick I'll pass. The portion was small not too mention over priced first and last time. Update when I went too work the next day my coworker mentioned too me he got sick too his stomach with hot and cold flashes almost had too call in sick with diarrhea no joke !"}
{"text":"I ordered pho, bah mie sammich and the shrimp wrapped in noodles then fried.  The pho broth was very tasty and flavorful the portion size was fantastic for the price.  The small came with more noodles and meat than I have ever seen and I felt bad for not finishing it.  The noodle wrapped shrimp were pretty tasty too,  and a neet item I've never seen anywhere else.  The sandwich was alright.  They don't offer any sandwiches with the liver pate or head cheese.  My complaint comes from the cleanliness of the place.  It's in a good spot and the building is well maintained but it was pretty dirty.  The floor was sticky, it sounded like walking on a movie theater floor.  They probably used too much soap in the water.  The table was dirty,  but we may have just gotten there just after a rush.  Thw bathroom was dusty and dirty.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the worst I've been in by far, but if they took a few hours and knocked out some dusting and cleaning it would have been a much more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I agree with My T. , they try hard.  Even if the food sucked, I would still come back because the owners are so nice!\  I love their pho.  I love their calamari.  I love their ice coffee.  I love their Bo La Lot (go to my My T's review for definition).  They have a stir fried shrimp dish which is fantastic, and be wary if you ask the chef to make it spicy, he can really make it spicy.    Special note:  When you order pho, you can order a side of onions sauteed in vingar and sugar.  However, the owner brought us a different version of this, which had lime and sriracha.  Oh my god this was delcious.  You have to get it!    My one complaint is the tables are too small, but eh, for good service, I will deal with a lot worse."}
{"text":"I called 3 times for a pick up, no body answer, so drive there and find the place open, I said to the waiter why you don't answer the phone, he says oh sorry we where very busy I look around and was only 1 table of 3 people. WTF is that, I guess they don't need business. And on top soup has weird flavor and smell, not good same with the ban mi chicken"}
{"text":"We had the worst dining experience here tonight with the food and service.  We had the worst customer service experience by the waitress who was too busy eating her Pho.  First it took her 5 minutes to come out from the back to seat us, then we waited another 10 minutes for her to take our order.  The food has always been good here, but tonight it was bad.  When the food came out, the fresh spring rolls didn't look so fresh.  My filet mignon pho had no taste.  My daughter's pho had weird looking steak.  The server throughout was so inattentive.  She didn't even bring out the bean sprouts n Thai basil platter.  I had to request for forks, napkins, and refills several times.  This place was a real waste of my $65.  I'm so disappointed, were never coming back!!"}
{"text":"I thought it was great.  I got the regular size of the Filet Mignon Pho and an order of shrimp and pork spring rolls.  This was way more than enough food for one.  The Pho broth was rich and flavorful and the filet on the side was very fresh and tender.  The spring rolls were quite fresh and tasty.  Good peanut sauce, as well.  The service was top notch.  Not only very prompt, but very, very friendly.  I would highly recommend this place!  I will visit every time I am in town for work."}
{"text":"No. No. No. This place has taken a nosedive in the past 1.5 years. The moment that you walk in, you are overwhelmed with smoke from the cigar shop next door. We had 2 different Pho bowls. Fried rice with chicken. Spring rolls & Vietnamese egg rolls. Hear me when I say: NOTHING tasted great. The rice had zero taste. The chicken in the rice did NOT taste like chicken. The Pho was bland. I didn't know that bland Pho existed. The spring rolls were 95% iceberg lettuce. My stomach is cramping right now. We won't be going there again.  Update 11-12-16-I have had severe cases of diarrhea & vomiting since eating there last night. Do not eat there for your own well-being. These people WILLINGLY served my one year old child rice with bad chicken. Thank goodness that we didn't let HIM eat it."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision and a good one.  I had the shrimp with crunchy egg noodles. The nest of noodles sat on some kind secret house sauce. The top was crunchy and the bottom of the nest was tender. It had a bit of spring though, not as tender as glass noodles.   The squid was so tender and flavorful. If you want to get away from deep dried squid then come here as your first try to other cooking methods.  The shrimp was tender and flavorful as well. Steamed just right. The star was the baby bok choy. Bok choy can be tricky to cook. Done the wrong way baby bok choy can be bitter. This baby bok choy was crispy yet tender and not bitter. Understand, not every piece will not be bitter,but this place has the best baby bok choy.   The disappointment of the dish were the couple fried fish balls. Don't be afraid of those, if cooked properly they are tasty. These however, were rubbery. Such a shame.  Their egg rolls were wonderful with a bit of pork, glass noodles, and what looked brine shrimp (know they were not). It was presented with a dipping sauce of light fish sauce and lime. The dipping sauce was light and brought out the egg  roll flavorful."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp while we were waiting for Chipotle to open and decided to just go here. There were a lot of reviews saying that the food was good. We were there at 10:30am and no one else was there. The men just started setting up everything when we sat down and they open at 10am. I noticed a distinct smell but I brushed it off thinking its just because my stuffy nose. I used their restroom to wash my hands. The trash was full. That means they never disposed it from the night before. Just outside the restroom were empty boxes. I peeked through one of them and it was dirty. When I passed by the door to the kitchen, I saw that everything was not organized and looked like someone left in a hurry the night before. When I got to the table, my husband tells me that the water tasted weird and the cups were dirty. He said the place is dirty and I agreed. I thought to myself if the place is dirty, I don't know about the food. I brushed it off my head telling myself the food must be bomb. They brought out the deep fried tofu first which we really liked. The pho that we ordered was just average. The shaking beef  looked black like burnt. It tasted fine but not something I'd recommend. An hour later me and my husband got an upset tummy. I wouldn't recommend this place after that."}
{"text":"Best tofu and dipping sauce is great! I drive from Aliante just to have there delicious spring rolls...shrimp with delicious peanut sauce"}
{"text":"I dunno how this pkace got such a high rating. When the food was awful. The place is dim & doesn't look too good. You smell a lot of smoke but guess that's from next door. Got take out. The food was fast. But the pho was way too salty. Had two sips of the soup and poured it out & the grill pork sandwich is salty too and missing something. Only took two bites of the sandwich & tossed it out. What a waste of $ & time driving over. Grrr.. I won't be going back. The only reason I came here is becuz someone was whiny & wanted pho, for this was the closest place to us. Sigh. Should have just went to in & out across the street & got my milkshake & veggie burger. Instead of wasting money & ending up eating leftovers. Sigh."}
{"text":"Ordered for carry out the other evening.  We ended up getting the order.  I am not too picky so I ate what was packaged.  Not sure what number they gave me. One of the meals had shrimp with all the pho phixens like bean sprouts, onions, ginger broth with sirracha sauce on the side.  I guess I can't be that upset that the wrong items were packaged to go because it was delicious.  The portion was very large and filled my belly well.    Next visit I might dine inside to ensure accuracy."}
{"text":"Pho seems like it is a simple thing to make... But the guys at Viet Bistro have found a way to do it really well.  The pho is well done and the ingredients are fresh. I often judge a place by the freshness of the ingredients they bring out with the pho - sprouts, herbs and jalapeños. They were great and very fresh.  The service was good and the man that brought the food out from the kitchen was so differential about it that you felt like you were about to embark onto a special journey upon receiving your meal. Service was good for a pho house (generally service at any pho place has a lower standard of service then other locals)."}
{"text":"ZYay! I don't have to drive to spring mountain for good pho.  Nice clean place. Not sure about the club lighting.  Family owned and very friendly.  Not like the rude service you get on spring mountain.  The broth was good and the portion was good, I could have used more vegetation.  Not the biggest portions, but you won't leave hungary.  The vietnamese coffee was great.  Not pre-mixed or from a can."}
{"text":"THEY'RE PHO SUCKS!!!! & DO NOT ORDER VIET BISTRO ON POSTMATES!! Viet Bistro lists one price on the app and charges you a higher price. We used to be regulars here but ever since the new ownership the quality and service has gone down. The pho is waaaaay to bland now. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and the food is decent. Price is reasonable for it's quality. The flavored for bun and pho decent and fall short of Saigon noodle a little bit. The restaurant is very spacious inside and can probably accommodate large groups. I haven't seen the place packed yet so I don't know how they can handle full capacity. I would definitely come back for casual dining."}
{"text":"#P7.  Get to know this dish and that's all you need to know.  One of the best Pho's in town hand's down.  Great when you are feeling a little under the weather and great when you just need to satisfy your Pho craving.  I also get the Vietnamese Spring Rolls which are delightful and not overly heavy (due to them being fried).  The P7 is the beef round eye Pho dish that is bursting with flavor and if you are really hungry, order the extra meat option for $6.   Overall one of the best under $10 value dinner's in town."}
{"text":"My friend invited me out to lunch today. It was my first time trying pho since I usually stick to ramen. We got to pick where we sat. It's a small place but you just have to know what the right times to come in are.   They only have Pepsi products.. Don't say that no one warned you! Their menu is very simple which is best when trying something new so it wasn't too overbearing for me!   I tried the fried wontons and the #1 without the cow stomach (it had a weird name?) The wontons were crispy and very good! It needed just a pinch of salt but then again, I always add too much salt to things as it is. It came in 4 pieces. It was $3.25 from what I remember. The pho comes in two different sizes. The regular is big but the large is huge! The large alone is enough to take home extras. The regular size is about 8.99. It's a fair price in my book! The broth is very light (keep in mind it's my first time trying pho) and I actually loved it. I added some salt (duh), soy sauce (I swear I'm going to die from high blood pressure) and Sriracha to it and it was just perfect. I don't really enjoy the noodles as much, but I loved the broth and beef so much. I think it was actually my favorite part! It also comes with a huge plate full of bean sprouts and limes so you can put as little or much as you'd like.   I should also add that they're very friendly here. It's a hidden gem right behind the Canes and In N Out on Rock Springs!   I'm happy with my first pho experience and I'll gladly come back here and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This used to be out favorite spot for pho since it's the only thing close without going to china town. We came here Saturday night. The smell from the cigars next door were pretty strong. We managed to muster thru and sit and wait for our pho. While doing so, I started to look around.  Stains, food, spills on the walls, the ice machine looks like it was on its last leg and filthy, the cashier/waitress kept wiping her nose on the back of her hand, cleaning products around the fountain drink station, dust hanging from the ceiling grill, must I go on. Channel 13 dirty dining would have a hay day there. Oh yeah the pho, mediocre at best with wilted and discoloring mint leaves and soft soggy bean sprouts. Definitely not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Eh eh!  Short review!  Not much to review.  Blan.  No personality.  Same result with the service!! Overpriced for Pho of this quality. Ill drive by next time.  Just blaaa."}
{"text":"Been to another Viet Bistro and food/service there was great! Not so here. Don't go here on Sunday afternoons. Slow service (owner was talking on his cell phone next to front door & one female server), food was so/so. Not kid friendly either. No cheater chopsticks. BBQ beef was more fat than meat. Pho was average. Curry beef was spicy, but more sauce than beef."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a better experience. When we walked in we were completely ignored for longer than was comfortable. I felt like I was intruding. My beef pho was somewhat enjoyable, the broth was good, but it missed the mark for me. The spring rolls were mostly lettuce and bland. I didn't hate it, but I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located next to a smoke shop so it can get really stuffy sometimes. I only drop by when I want to eat one thing: bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup).  The waitress, Tania, always remembers me. I stop by once a month when I want to splurge a little and satisfy my craving for bun bo hue. Shops in Oakland, San Gabriel, and other cities with lots of Vietnamese restaurants do not compare! Vietnam Bistro's noodle soup broth is beefy with lemongrass and complex herbal notes."}
{"text":"Services was HORRIBLE.. DONT GO !! ... Very pushy on us ordering.. Wanted us to rush .. Was telling us what to order ... The whole place smelted like smoke .. The guy taking the orders and that charged us out kept on cursing with f bombs and the s word ... Yelling at kids that came in ... The food was ok .. Had better ... Over heard a take out order was wrong and they were just going to pick out the chicken from the rice when it was to be shrimp and not make the gentleman a fresh plate ... He saw then do it and picked it out ... JUST DONT GO !!"}
{"text":"I have had a few different phos here and they are always great. I really like that they have a small and large portion - the small size is pefect for me and I dont feel so wasteful!   Only complaint is the drink menu - we have tried ordering drinks on the menu and they never have what we want. Not sure if they run out or dont stock it...they seem to only consistently offer water and soft drinks."}
{"text":"my first time earing Vietnamese, they were very nice in explaining the foods.  services are great food is good, not much on atmosphere. quite very plain...but if you just want some good food and good service this is it."}
{"text":"Finally a good Vietnamese restaurant on the west side of town. The food was good and unlike most places in chinatown the service was good. You dont have to mimic choking to get refill like at Pho so 1. Everything we had was great. They dont serve a ton of condiments to gobwoth egg rolls or bun. But the herbs they do put in the dishes compliment the flavors so well. The spicy beef soup was the best i have had hands down."}
{"text":"I have always loved all asian food, and vietnamese is one of my favorites.  I had never been here before but after reading the reviews I had to try it.  The menu was pretty extensive, but I tried the spring rolls and pho.  The broth was rich and flovorful with hardly any grease like other places.  The prices were a little high, but expected beings we werent in chinatown.  The staff was very nice too.  The only.thing I wished that they served more herbs for the broth and rolls."}
{"text":"Good food! Great service! And very honest too! I left my expensive Channel sunglasses on the table while I was dining there and didn't remember until the next day. But they were honest enough to return it to me when I went there to pick it up. They could of easily said \"No we didn't find your sunglasses.\" And sold it for few hundred bucks but instead they laughed and joked about it and returned it to me with a smile. I will definitely return a favor by going there for Vietnamese food as long as I live in this area. So if you want good food, great service and you live in this area and don't wanna beat the traffic to Chinatown, I suggest you visit Viet Bistro."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because me and my boyfriend didn't want to drive all the way to Pho Kim Long to get Bún. Beat idea yet! This place has better Bún than Pho Kim Long and it's just down the street.   Only complain I have is that the lighting is really weird. They have yellow and blue lights in the ceiling and it's hard to see."}
{"text":"Excellent banh mi.  Bbq. Pork. Delicious. Comes with a broth that you can dip your sandwich in. Also ordered the Vietnamese egg rolls. Delicious. I totally recommend this place. It's cheap , fast and very fresh. Well worth the 13.00."}
{"text":"Half of my week is spent working in Summerlin, and the Vietnamese options are slim pickings, but this is my go to spot when the craving arises during my work lunch hour.  For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique.   I know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the true gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).     I was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood a couple of months ago and couldn't believe that I was in walking distance to a Vietnamese restaurant! The handful of times I have been so far and have always been welcomed by the friendly staff - usually with a open door due to having the little one in two with me via stroller. The main fella there always greets my boy and myself with a smile. I usually stay with chicken pho, which is delicious here but my most recent visit I decided to be adventurous and try the oxtail pho and was even more impressed!  I am always excited for our pho day because it is always delicious when we go. My little guy loves the noodles as well :) The price is pretty fair, a little more expensive than most but the taste and quality is worth the extra couple dimes. Lastly, try their coffee! My mother and I can split one and feel like we've had two-three espresso shots and it trumps any old starbucks when it comes to taste!"}
{"text":"Have bee going to this location for years now and it is consistent and very very good. The service is out standing and the Pho is even better! Would have given them 5 stars if they delivered. When you want Viet bistro, you WANT Viet Bistro! If you are not feeling well the combination pho is a great remedy. Excellent except food and service!"}
{"text":"Oh pho ~ how do I love thee? At Viet Bistro there is only one fabulously sublime way... Filet mignon pho. *sigh* I'm dreaming about it while I am actually eating it right now, it's that damn good.  The best part about this place is that they let you mix the ingredients yourself. All of the veggies are in their own bag, the beef is compartmentalized & raw so you can cook it fresh at home! Usually the hot broth at most places will over cook most meats, veggies & noodles by the time you take a pre-mixed pho home, ruining it. This place has tasty noodles, perfect lemongrass broth, tons of extra onions, both white & green, lime wedges to balance out the lemongrass & tender thin slices of soft tasting filet mignon. I get extra broth, so that I can make a few bowls over 2 days. The extra broth & pho is $17.85 & I give them $20, worth every damn penny. Every single time I have it ~ I wish I could drink some of Alice in Wonderland's shrinking potion, so that my mini-me could happily do the backstroke in the broth before slurping every good bit down. Worth the drive from wherever you are. :) *sigh* I think I will have another bowl."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Called in an order for 2 beef bahn mi's, the lady hung up before I finished my order I call back to say the end of my order and asked how long, but she hung up again. Called back a third time to see what my order even is and how long, no one answers. If you were busy you should have said 1 second or really anything. Terrible customer service before even setting foot in the restaurant is something I'm not prepared to deal with. Just lost a potential regular. Anyone know a good bahn mi place here in town?"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! I usually go to another Pho place in China Town, but this is by far the best Pho joint in the Northwest. It's quaint and the staff is friendly. It's a little dark, but I definitely recommend. I got #B6, the Pork Bún."}
{"text":"I ordered a noodle bowl & told the waitress I was allergic to peanuts, so no peanuts in my noodle bowl. She acknowledged it; however, I was then delivered a noodle bowl with peanuts. She took it back and not even 2 minutes later returned with a bowl - this had only 1 egg roll and 2 shrimp - despite the previous bowl having 2 egg rolls and 4 shrimp. I then examined the bowl and found peanuts in the pork - my boyfriend confirmed by tasting it... I could also smell it. This could have died from this exposure. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"We love Vietnamese restaurants, unfortunately this one just does not stack up against the average, maybe too much to expect in Vegas? Everything seems a little sub-par. Price is too much ($11 for extra large pho vs $8 average), you call that grilled beef? Seems like pork to me. That is pork chop? Seems like small pieces to me."}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas. Have tried most pho places in Vegas and this is it. Filet mignon pho is exquisite."}
{"text":"Favorite phö restaurant. Food comes in seriously less than 5 min."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot to come to for phö. I ONLY come here. Amazing service and incredible food every time. I love it"}
{"text":"Bun bue hue is insane wear a bib  Spring rolls are awesome and oxtail pho. Insane  Pho here is stellar, huge portion.  I add extra meatballs and its like DINNER  Fast fa-fa-fa-freking awesome lunch or dinner.  Incredible vietnese food in The Northwest, W Lake Mead and 95, by Panera Bread and Chipolte  Love the soupy goodness insane I ate it like a pig and now my lips are burning perfect burn best balance ever get the special hot sauce made by owner it's so insanely out of control great!  I vote this my FAVORITE PLACE for PHO in Vegas@!"}
{"text":"Excellent as always!!!! Always eat there for lunch ... Never at night and it was so good!!! Glad the weather is cooling off so we can get our weekly fix!!!!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from the strip to try the bun hue and ginger ice tea. The bun bo hue had no hint of spice, huyet, or pig's feet. I had Pho that was more spicier than this. Big disappointment however the ginger ice tea was good.   Food is 3 stars but will subtract one star for the high prices. I can get the same quality of food in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I liked that they played music in French, and the server was nice, BUT... The rice paper wrapping on the fresh spring rolls was tough and hard to chew, the bun bo hue soup was overly salty, and my chicken wings were dry and tasteless.  I  went there mid-week for lunch since I was in the area.  My order was mostly take out-- as in taking it out and trashing it.  Sorry, but this isn't real (or good) Vietnamese food.  Needless to say, I won't be ordering from this place again...  :("}
{"text":"Service is bad but the food is bomb. One of the better pho briskets I've had in town. The egg rolls were great too. I came here on a Tuesday night so it was dead so it didn't really matter to me that the waitress was on her phone the entire time. When I needed something I just raised my hand and she came over. I can see it being annoying on a busy night though. Nonetheless I would definitely come again. One of the better options for pho not on spring mountain."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved here from Iowa where my family owns a few restaurants and sell amazing pho--- So I was a little on edge trying a new place where my family's recipe wasn't sold.   We ate at Viet Bistro and loved it!! It's definitely not the same as my mom's or auntie's cooking, but it was very delicious! I am Laos so I require fish sauce and sugar, when I asked for it, they were able to bring some out for me.  We will be back to try more items and for more pho! (:"}
{"text":"Delicious pho broth though skimpy on the fresh herbs.  Imperial spring rolls were a little disappointing. Not sure if it was the crab in them, but they tasted sort of eggy. Will definitely return for the combination pho and the bun bo hue."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Viet Bistro on Lake Mead for close to a year now whenever I'm craving Pho~! The staff is nothing but polite and FAST, and the food is always amazing. I'm a big fan of their combination Pho, and the egg rolls are always crispy and delicious too. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and I'm glad that I live within a reasonable enough distance to go whenever I want!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The pho was not very flavorful. The meat was over cooked and fatty. My bf had fried rice which was actually pretty good though but the pho is a loser. The place is not well air conditioned and you can smell the cigar store next door. Don't think ill be back if i do its for rice to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho joint in Vegas. I started coming here once a week until I moved away for my pho fix, and I miss it often. The owners are delightful, and they put very good food on the table.  I always get the vegetable/tofu pho. Their broth is incredibly fragrant, and it comes fast and piping hot. Plenty of veggies, noodles cooked well, really good. I also enjoy their banh mi sandwich, all different kinds. One day I decided to order ginger tea lemonade instead of my usual water. Holy crap! Best drink I've ever had! I became obsessed quickly, and the woman who makes it fresh came out eventually to tell me how to make it. I won't be straining fresh ginger any time soon, so I just dream of it instead.  Great service, quick service, and friendly. Love Viet Bistro!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find Vietnamese near my house! I no longer have to go down Spring Mt. for pho or banh mi! The grilled pork banh mi had a spicy marinade. No complaints here. It wasn't as sweet or smokey as Mr. Sandwich."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get some Vietnamese Cuisine. Service is very fast and the food is absolutely delicious! I love the Pho and noodle dishes. The Sandwiches are great too. I always come here since it is close to my home. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Don't even bother with this place. Save your money and go somewhere else. Such a disappointment. They didn't even have basil or limes for the soup.They said they don't use limes! What kind of Vietnamese restaurant is this? The lady didn't even refill our drinks or water. There's absolutely no customer service. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Well, we sat down to have a nice bowl of phö and promptly got back up again and left. The air smelled putrid due to smoke from cigars because of the cigar store next-door. We love the food here but just can't get past the smell of cigars while eating. Sorry :-("}
{"text":"Small, intimate place next to Cupcakery which has a full scale menu but none of the items really impressed me.  We had the Tamrarind Chicken Wings.  The wings weren't seasoned and only glazed on the outside.  When you bit into the chicken, it was just dry with not much flavor.  They should season the wings before they fry it, then add the glaze.  I wouldn't order these again.  I had the Lemon Grass Chicken and substituted rice for vermicelli.  The lemon grass chicken wasn't bold enough but I liked the taste of the onions.  My friend ordered the Combination Vermicelli bowl with pork, shrimp, and meatballs.  This was definitely the best dish we ordered but anything on Spring Mtn is better.  They do have Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef), Banh Mi sandwiches, and a wide array of Pho.   Based on the items we ordered, it's average compared to Viet eateries in Spring Mountain but is a decent option for those who live in the West Lake Mead area.    Since I don't live in the area, I probably won't make an effort to make it back, but it was average.    The service was really nice, atmosphere is good, and  you can always hit up the Cupcakery for dessert afterwards."}
{"text":"I need to give Viet Bistro a 4 just for the simple fact that they continue to operate when all of the other pho places nearby seem to open and close every few months. It's consistent, the staff is nice and the food comes out quickly, making this place a good work lunch spot. I usually get the tofu and vegetable pho but last time I got the hue spicy lemongrass tofu and vegetable soup which kind of blew my mind. It has way more flavor than pho and they serve it with this spicy paste that ups the spice level tremendously. It's also served with mint instead of basil as well as the bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno. The noodles in this are round and similar to spaghetti instead of the vermicelli that comes with the pho. I actually prefer the vermicelli because the round noodles get soggy quicker but other than that this dish is far superior. My coworkers ordered the special combination banh mi and it was crazy small with not a lot of filling. It's too bad these don't come with anything but the sandwich. I think people would pay more for a side or pay less to be able to get two sandwiches. Overall I'm glad to keep coming back to Viet Bistro."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Full of flavor, well balanced, good customer service. Fish salad was my favorite! Seafood pho did not taste like it was full of sudium!"}
{"text":"Food was good and authentic. One less star because the staff seemed like they were struggling a little with amount of customers"}
{"text":"The real stand-out from this restaurant is the Beef Carpaccio. Wafer thin slices of tender lean beef draped over a perfectly balanced salty, sweet, sour and spicy salad topped with fried shallots. This dish is a 5 STAR dish. I will definitely come back but this dish is now something I dream about.   The service is great, clean and friendly. The Pho was spot on.  When my wife had some pho packed up to go the server had the kitchen separate the noodles out so they didn't get soggy.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pho! The vietnamese egg rolls are a great addition to the meal as well. The restaurant is very clean and has a nice environment. The owner is friendly and attentive. And the best part is, I don't have to drive to Chinatown to enjoy great pho! I will definitely be coming back to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Wow, A thumbs up in my book! And guess what?! It's in the NW neighborhood say whaaaa?! Lol. Anyways I'm a very picky Pho person because I'm all about homemade ;) So when choosing a pho place I sort of turn into a pho nazi.  This place wasn't the worst nor the best, but it was pretty good I must say.   A regular bowl was perfect not to big nor too small. The broth had lots of flavor but it wasn't mind blowing good they used a lot of ginger in the broth which isn't bad but if you no like ginger then I don't know maybe you no like it because it has a strong ginger aroma when brought to the table. (Excuse my FOB moment) But it was good. Oh and an added plus I'm happy that they didn't get stingy with noodles like some places do. When ordering pho you always get a small plate of veggies for your soup I just wish they offer more variety of oriental greens selections like the other places.  I also ordered some coconut juice :) it was awesome! It came out in a fresh coconut!!   Service was great food came fast and it was a very friendly environment. It's great to have a good pho place close by in our NW area. I will definitely consider coming back for a quick grab n go place to eat."}
{"text":"At long last, Madison has a place that serves up great dim sum.  I will agree that the service needs to improve, and rapidly, since I can imagine the learning curve to transition from a Vietnamese order at the table to a dim sum cart service restaurant is steep."}
{"text":"Walked in, place smelled like a cigar shop...walked out, went to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"This place is ok for a vietnamese restaurant. First impression walking in- this place smells of cigars! Later I realized it's the smell of the cigar bar next door.   Service was rather quick. The man who attended to us seemed to be the owner, he was approachable and would give recommendations if you ask.   Our food was out pretty fast. I ordered the beef pho with eye round steak and beef balls while the bf got his usual chicken pho. We also got the vietnamese iced coffee.   I love the broth! It was not as greasy as some of the other vietnamese places I've been to, and you can actually taste the herbs. The rice noodles was meh, it was a little too starchy for me, for some reason. The eye round steak was a little overdone. Iced coffee was a tad too sweet, there's a little too much of the condensed milk.   Overall, a decent experience. I'll probably come back again.   Side note: if you like spicy food, ask for the ot satay sauce. it's basically Thai chillies fried with garlic paste and it is SPICY- a much better alternative to siracha, in my opinion."}
{"text":"5 Star all the way around. Customer service was unbelievable.  Food  was amazing and price was cheap. My husband and I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I had Pho so I felt adventurous today.  Since my husband and I moved to Summerlin we weren't sure what was out here to try. So then I found this place right off of Flamingo which was less than 2 miles from us and went. I ordered my favorite drink Thai iced tea with boba. It wasn't as sweet as usual but more subtle. For an appetizer I went with the fresh spring rolls. Most places put mint and lemongrass in these rolls but this was much smaller rolls and stuffed with lettuce, shredded pork and shrimp. I ordered the noodle bowl with everything in it including my favorite tendon and tripe.  The broth was very tasty and perfect. There was just enough noodles and I definitely loved it when I enhanced it with some Sriracha. Can't go wrong with that. Great place to go for a Vietnamese noodles and the service was really good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to get Pho near Summerlin.  Folks there are always friendly and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years because it is close to my side of town. Rather than go to Spring Mountain for what is likely better food, decided to go here again. RUDE service. If you don't want my money, just tell me so I can spend my hard earned cash elsewhere.   It wasn't the owner who was rude. She is generally nice. Won't be back. Only thing from them getting one star is the food is decent."}
{"text":"We eagerly anticipated the opening of Viet Bistro when they first started their construction.  Good Vietnamese in the Northwest??  An independently owned ethnic restaurant in the middle of a chain/franchise restaurant filled strip center???  Viet Bistro has good food and service, and it sure beats driving to Chinatown for my regular go-to spot for pho, Pho So 1.  Viet Bistro is pricier but I'm sure rent in this plaza is not cheap.  Their egg rolls and shrimp fresh rolls are excellent.  I've ordered their grilled pork vermicelli noodles and its outstanding.  I've also ordered that to go and they package it up nicely.  My wife loves their Hue Spicy Noodle soup.  I'm afraid to try it because it looks so spicy...almost like flames simmering in the broth!!!  The one thing I don't care for is unfortunately the one item on a Vietnamese menu that usually defines the restaurant - the Pho.  Whenever I eat pho at restaurants I order the brisket & well-done flank.  I've probably had this dish in a dozen+ restaurants.  At Viet Bistro, I find the beef to be too thick and tough to chew.   However, Viet Bistro does offer something I've never seen before - Filet Mignon Pho. Wow!!!  Delicious thin slices of filet but pricey at $11.  Overall nice to see this restaurant do well in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've had the pho here before, and it was good.. But the Bun Bo Hue is the thing to get here. If you're in the summerlin area and want pho, just stop looking. This isn't the only place, but it's pretty close. The only negative, I suppose is that it's right next to a cigar bar, so if that bothers you, you might want to get it to go. Otherwise, the place is great. Service is always good as well."}
{"text":"Yummy! Im so happy i found this place! So close by the house! Friendly service! Owner was so nice and checking on us! Bun bo hue is spicy just how I like it! Im definitely coming back to try more things!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, super good food. Great service. If you have special request the so deliver. I tried many Vietnamese places in Vegas and this one is the best."}
{"text":"Best pho in the southwest. The pho here has a homemade taste without the heavy msg feel.  The sandwiches and tofu in xo sauce are also delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Vietnamese food fan. I have pho once a week. I went to Vegas to visit my in law and take them there for lunch. I have been try Vietnamese food everywhere I go. Even in a small little town in North Dakota. This place very disappointed to me. Pho and summer rolls wasn't taste right and they cut beef very too thick. I won't go back there.  Server has bad attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing oxtail Pho! Change your life! The chef prepares the beef broth for 15 hours... that is dedication!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in North West Las Vegas.  The broth has a unique flavor and is always good.  I try to visit Viet Bistro at least once a week.  The staff is always friendly and your food comes out very quickly.  With over 20% tax and tip, I am able to have a large bowl of pho tai for $11.00 out the door.   I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I used to love this Pho place but I got very disappointed today when we had our Pho dinner. This place is neglected in every way We came in and stood by door for a bit with no one greeting or seating us. We have to go to the counter way at the back and ask the lady where can we seat. Then when we ordered our Pho, they served us a brown colored, spoiled bean sprouts. We asked the lady to replace it and she seemed surprise why. We told her it is spoiled and brown; then a guy approached us and asked what the problem is and we told them the bean sprout is spoiled. They replaced it, but aint any different and gave me an excuse that it was how they got the delivery that morning. We did not eat the bean sprout and we will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I'm not even done with my pho and I had to write. This broth is a work of art.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"First time here. I live out of state and we have many pho places but this one beats them all!!! Everything came out quickly and tasted fresh and clean, no MSG salty taste. Excellent food and service, a must try!!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find a Vietnamese restaurant pop up in this NW neighborhood.    The place is small (holds 31 people), with walls painted orchid and new tile floors.  The staff were just as bright and shiny (friendly) as the decor.  I decided to go straight up the middle with the Bun Bo Hue.  The Thai Ice Tea probably isn't a proper match, but I had a craving for it.  :)  The soup arrived before I could return from washing my hands for lunch.  It was very good, but a bit bland, probably due to their holding back after seeing the round-eye in the American Flag t-shirt.  Whatever, I'm used to it.  Nothing that a big dollop of chili sauce can't cure!  Delicious broth, beef parts, noodles, sprouts, veggies and herbs.  Yum!  The prices are reasonable and perfectly average for this type of fare.  Lunch special is 10% off from 11am-3pm.  Happy Hour (sorry, they don't serve alcohol... Or else this place would be PERFECT) is 20% off from 3pm-6pm.  A great solo first experience.  I will DEFINITELY come back with family and friends in tow to explore the menu further."}
{"text":"this is the first time we tried viet bistro and it was legit.  we got the filet mignon pho which was top class.  these guys do not mess around.  the quality of the meat was exquisite.  the soup broth was really savory and also legit.  the owners seemed like good people and the service was overall really dialed in."}
{"text":"I came at around noon on a Sunday and was not impressed. There was one other person in there for lunch--kind of sketchy.  My pho was ok, but not great. I ordered the combo meat pho without tripe--the meats were not as tender as I would like, and the brisket was pretty much inedible.  My BF had the vegetarian pho with vegetarian broth, which he liked. It can be hard to find pho places with truly vegetarian pho (sometimes they lie to you) so we appreciated that.  Still on the search to find the best pho place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I ordered pho soup to go & told the server NO ONIONS pls! Sure enough whn i got home there was onions mixed in my meat entree, also ordrd chix wings & Wow this is the most tiniest, skinniest & not only that the cooking powder was stil uncooked,we paid $5.50 for those 6 tiny pcs..."}
{"text":"We went back to the Viet Bistro for lunch. I had the grilled pork sandwich. My sweetie had the shrimp bun... I was tempted to go with the bun as well, but wanted to try the sandwich I'd heard so much about.  My sandwich was excellent, the  veggies were so flavorful, the bread was very good quality. Vietnamese make THE MOST KILLER sandwiches known to me.  The bun, pho, and sandwiches I could never tire of.  If more americans would eat Vietnamese cuisine, there would be far fewer fat people. My new favorite restaurant. I may never eat at a mexican restaurant again. Just kidding. Seriously :)"}
{"text":"There is nothing I love more than a small intimate pho spot. Coming from the northern California Bay Area, where pho is every where. I moved to Las Vegas a few months ago during the peak of the heat and haven't had much reason to chow down on some pho, but today in early pregnancy with terrible morning sickness all I wanted was pho.   This little place is amazing! The fresh ginger lemonade was a complete blessing for my stomach.  It's obvious the sweet, and family like owners are passionate about their food, as every piece of produce was extremely fresh in flavor, and even the fruit slices are sliced to perfection.   It's cozy and you can feel the love in every sip of broth. I have a feeling we will be back... often."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas almost 5 years and somehow have avoided the Pho craze until now. I always hear amazing things about it but somehow I never felt compelled enough to drive to a Vietnamese restaurant until a few days ago when I was getting a massage.  The waitress/owner was great. She understood that I was a Pho virgin and wanted me to have the best experience possible. I ended up with a combination Pho and was very happy with my choice.   I can't truly judge my overall Pho experience because I have nothing to base it on. However, I do know that the Pho broth was incredible and the friendly and attentive service was for sure worth 4 stars. I also added a 3 bean dessert that was as incredible as it was strange in both taste and consistency. I have NO CLUE what I ate."}
{"text":"I order seafood pho  it was tasty good  but only has shrimp and fish. But sadly , sadly I have to say this place is dirty  No soap in the restroom , sticky floor's , a pair of shoes by the main  entrance door , dirty ,  sticky menu's and more If they take care of the place and keep clean  I'll be there at least 3 times at month. But this is my first and last time."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find a Pho place on this side of town without having to drive all the way to Chinatown. Food was very good, service was so-so. Their combination Pho was nice and flavorful and full of meat.. their Vietnamese egg rolls were DELICIOUS although they were kind of skimpy on the vegetables. The server took our food order, dropped off the food and never came back to check on us until we were done. They weren't even busy. I said 'thank you' on three different occasions and I didn't even hear a peep out of the guy. I really don't think it was a language barrier since 'thank you' is pretty universal and he was able to say 'are you ready to order.' If I am too lazy to drive to Chinatown, I would definitely come  back for the food again."}
{"text":"one of the best Bun Bo Hue bowls in town.  The broth is soothing and not too spicy.  The noodles are thick and perfectly cooked.  It has the right balance.  the PHO is not too bad also.  The springs rolls I can take it or leave it.  Do try the Bun Bo Hue."}
{"text":"Decided to go here during my lunch break after not having any Vietnamese food for quite some time!   I ordered bun thit nuong cha gio (rice noodles with pork and egg rolls). The dish itself was good and I don't really have any major complaints, but I will say that the flavor isn't as strong as some other restaurants I have been to. Although that could be due to the fact that I've been to a bunch of Vietnamese restaurants back in Garden Grove (in California) and the food there is cheaper as well xD. The veggies were good and the egg rolls were crispy, albeit they were on the skinny side haha. One thing I didn't like was how the noodles was all clumped and sticky since it took some time and maneuvering with my chopsticks to be able to mix all the ingredients together. Besides that, everything else went smoothly lol.  The atmosphere was clean and the staff was very polite and attentive (which is a big plus considering Asian restaurants have been known to lack good customer service). I saw a good amount of people in the restaurant which was reassuring although I didn't see many Asian people in there at that time xD. Where are all my Asian peeps at?   Overall, this is a good place to check out if you want some Vietnamese food and you are in the area. The portions are good and the price isn't that bad compared to how much you would spend for a meal. I'll check out some other nearby places so stayed tuned in case I find something better!"}
{"text":"Had my very first pho experience here and id have to say it went pretty great!  The service was awesome, the lady pretty much turned me into a pho expert after explaining all about it and the many different ways to pho.  She gave me the down low on what I might like, and suggested the lean beef which my husband and I both ordered and ended up loving!  The place seemed clean to me and everyone in the restaurant seemed happy.  I'll be back for more pho, it was delicious and I'm excited to have a new food to chose from when I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"4 instead of 5 stars because of the high price. The Pho is my favorite so far in Vegas. I really think the weird smokey smell is due to the incense they have with their daily offering or whatever it is, sorry I'm not Buddhist so don't really know. Overall I would recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good.  It was close and I did not want  to drive all the way to spring mountain for some Vietnamese food.  Sadly, I still have to drive there to get some good food.  Maybe it was a bad night, maybe it was because I came in a half and hour before they were closed but I ordered the pork meatball spring rolls and the rice noodles with grilled pork.  When i went home and opened up my to go boxes.  the rice noodles were actually shrimp instead.  I was pretty sad about that.  The rolls were alright, and thats why they get another star.  But there was alot of filler.  Mostly just shredded lettuce.  The rice noodle dish was the one that turned me down on the place.  The grilled shrimp were over cooked, the noodles were hard and under cooked.  There was mostly lettuce and the sauce was very watered down.  I will give it a second chance, but I will proceed with caution."}
{"text":"I had Viet Bistro bookmarked since...when it hit Yelp but because it is on the other side of the world (exaggerated here but it is pretty far) from me, I was able to finally tried it as our puppy is on that side of town.  I got the Bun Bo Hue and my bf got the Oxtail Pho Soup.  The Bun Bo Hue was decent, but my once piece of tiny pork hock was not tender, and unfortunately, that is my favorite part about eating this soup.  The noodles were very short too.    The Oxtail Pho soup was decent as well.  The star anise flavor was very overpowering.  The service was good.  For now, it's an A-Ok."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place to enjoy authentic Vietnamese food. Menu is extensive - there's something for everyone folks.   The Vietnamese ice coffee with condensed milk is especially recommended.   The beef pho broth is flavorful without excess salt nor fat. The meat portion in my regular-sized pho soup was generous.  I sat next to the door and noticed that this place does A TON of take-out business.  I like the fact that chopsticks are made of permanent, plastic in a paper wrapper; not the usual flimsy balsa wood disposable chopsticks that give you mouth splinters.  I've eaten at some of the best Vietnamese places on both coasts. This place is the real deal and next time I'm back in Vegas for a conference,  I will surely be back!  Recommend to Vegas Yelpers, you lucky dogs!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place and I have tried many! This is one of not many places in town that has a vegetable broth option (for those with food restrictions) it is delicious and light!  Food is always fresh and consistent. I'm always equally satisfied with flavors and so have been every single person who has been here with me. I always order the vegetable pho with vegetable broth which comes with broccoli, bok choy and carrots. They have a fried tofu appetizer that is what some could call \"tofu done right\" and it is amazing! I usually tolerate tofu but whatever way they fry this one, makes it taste divine! Comes with a delicious soy dipping sauce. The staff are nice and friendly. The decor consists of odd things for pictures framed but really is forgivable as the food is good enough to forgive that small blunder. The whole space is of an odd shape and leaves you having an odd feeling like you should rearrange the tables yet not knowing how.  Fresh, delicious food fairly priced is all you really need to know. :) Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Went here during a week long pho marathon in search of good pho. The pho isn't bad but it is low on meat and the broth could have more flavor. I'd eat there if I happened to be in the center and hungry"}
{"text":"I came here with my family of 10 about a week ago and we came here hoping to get some good pho because it is close to where we live. First off, the menu had way too many options so it was very confusing and bad for those who are indecisive. Second, the waiter who said he was new there... kept on getting our orders wrong and he didn't understand what we were talking about when I tried to explain to him. What's worst is that when he came out with the wrong order he wanted me to just accept it and pay for it. My answer was of course no, because it wasn't what I wanted and he finally took it back after telling him that several of times. I ordered a bum bo hue, my usual when I go to pho restaurants, there was way more soup than noodle. The soup was not spicy even though It's suppose to, the noodle was overcooked, and the meat was not good. I am a big eater and I am definitely a huge foodie but this place was unsettling. The only good thing was the tried egg rolls and that was all, but the prices for it weren't very fair in my opinion. My little brother and sister ordered the the regular pho noodle soup, and when I tasted their soup I tasted like it was just diluted soy sauce soup. Anyways, I definitely won't be going back, but at least I tried it and now I know that the pho places in the Chinatown area taste way better."}
{"text":"I may have just found one of my favorite rice plates here in town, and in my neck of the woods!  We tried their Combination Pho, House Special Roast Chicken and BBQ Pork Banh Mi. The Pho broth was a little too sweet for my liking, but the Roast Chicken Leg and the Banh Mi were so good, I would return for those two items. I was also able to enter the PLUOY photo contest with a sticker that was on their front door, and was able to come in 2nd out of all the entries! Not bad considering I did little to no campagning! (See My Profile picture...:),   I finished off with an avocado boba and wifey tried their 3 color drink which were both disappointing. Wouldn't susggest those.... We will return for the rice plates and banh mi!...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(329/365) \"Go For The Food, Not the Drinks\""}
{"text":"I just moved here from California, where my Vietnamese best friend would always take me out to eat Pho from her favorite restaurants.  I saw the reviews here and thought I would check it out.  O so super yummy.  I'm totally gonna come back here.  The atmosphere isn't the bomb, but USUALLY the best restaurants don't have the best atmosphere."}
{"text":"Started out with simple egg rolls and they were delish. Vietnamese coffee very tasty. Sliced pork over noodles more tasty than my high end cat food my guardians give me and more reasonable"}
{"text":"Great Viet place when you're in summerlin. There's not a lot to choose from in this area, so I find myself here when I need my Vietnamese food fix.   Service is great. I usually do take out and the lady knows me by now. My favorite is the rice and charbroiled chicken and their friend spring rolls is so good!"}
{"text":"I'm being nice by giving them two stars. Pulled in on a  Saturday evening at 6:30 pm and there were no customers in the restaurant. Owner was actually sitting in his vehicle out front. There was one table left dirty with dishes, I found that odd, with no customers, every table should be clean and ready to go. Food was ok, Pho was below average  and the tea was luke warm. You have better choices."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the fresh lumpia (shrimp & pork spring roll). I came around 4 pm on Wednesday & ordered to-go because we had been studying at Panera the whole day & I wanted Asian food. I absolutely love fresh lumpia made well, & have been in search of it in Vegas for a while. Every place here advertises pho but not lumpia! Anywho, I decided to make just one order in case it sucked & I was glad I did. The lumpia itself was ok--crispy, fresh, of a good size & wrapped tightly, great dipping sauce--but not great. The shrimp was cut into halves of shrimp so instead of being a whole row of shrimp on one side, it was a whole row of half a shrimp. Whut. Also, no bean sprouts, and the very light slivers of rice noodles were inside the crisp lettuce. No wonder it was only $5. The pork on one side lacked taste. Overall, 3/5. Decent but not good. Still trying to find the perfect fresh lumpia."}
{"text":"Good Pho, I always take it to go as this restaurant is next to a cigar shop that often smells smoky."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago with my coworker and haven't had the time to review this place but I give it one star because initially when we walked in it smelled. I didn't know if I was walking into a restaurant or a casino.  Once my coworker and I got our food, we saw a beetle or some kind of bug crawling from the sauces on our table. It was quite disgusting. Probably won't come here again"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've found.  The La Lot is great. And the Pho is, too.  Really authentic with a reasonably priced menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pho is always delicious. The staff is always very pleasant and sweet. So what about the cigar smell, its Vegas. Next time I go Im gonna try something else on the menu. But the pho is always on point!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am 100% sure this is a drug front. We sat down to eat, 15 minutes go by and nothing. Asked the guy if we should order or go somewhere else. He said he dodnt speak english and the other guy was busy. What? There was only one other party in there and they hadnt even ordered. Eventually we left and went to pho rose instead. About 10 minutes later the other party that was at the this restaurant showed up at Pho Rose too."}
{"text":"I really appreciate vietnamese food in general but I especially like the Vietnamese restaurants who are more authentic. I read the reviews posted by others so while I am in Las Vegas I decided to \"stray\" from our usual spot, the Pho 8 and give the Viet Bistro a try. Well, we were not disappointed. First of all the service is exceptional. We were made to feel welcome immediately. The Lemon Ginger tea is awesome. Had the Cha gios and they were made by a mom because they were awesome. My mother had the Pho with the fillet and it was great. I had the Bun Bo Hue that everyone has been recommending here and I can say their Bun Bo Hue is the very best vietnamese soup I have ever had, bar none and I have traveled the world. We are going to the restaurant again before I leave so I can take my brother there (he swears by the pho 8). If you have not been to this restaurant, you really need to give it a try. It is that good."}
{"text":"The pho was  delicious (P1). The thai iced tea with boba was great. Service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"Never coming back there was a worm on our food!! And the vegetables were so old it's disgusting that someone can serve food like this ! I will never ever return to this place, besides the fact of the horrible food experience the place reeked like cigarette smoke !!! Wish I can give no stars!!"}
{"text":"This location has fantastic pho. It is ready for pickup within ten minutes of calling and reasonably priced. The taste is something we crave frequently and a few times a month we enjoy ordering from here.  When you order to go they separate the broth from the ingredients and include containers of hoisin sauce as well as Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"After trying Pho Rancho, I was on a quest to find some pho that seriously hit the spot. This one wasn't the best I've had but I did enjoy it more than the previous place I tried earlier in the week. I was greeted and seated right away and our server brought drinks and took our order within five minutes of us being seated. Our food came out pretty quick, within 15 minutes even though it was pretty busy. I got the spring rolls (with pork and shrimp), a banh mi with pork and a large order of beef pho. Everything was really good and the bread they used for their sandwiches is really tasty. The only thing I didn't like was the super strong smell of cigars! Unfortunately it's right next to a smoke shop and for non-smokers like myself, the smell is extremely noticeable. Other than that, the food and service was great."}
{"text":"They have some of the best bbq pork! My new favorite Vietnamese spot in all of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't great at all and they didn't have the Vietnamese coffee or any other beverages aside from water"}
{"text":"Once I got inside, you can already tell that the ambiance isn't good because you can IMMEDIATELY smell the smoke from the smoke shop next door. There's no music playing or anything. The man who sat me and took my order was the only time he talked to me.   I got the pho dac biet (which is what I usually get at viet places). So, per usual, you get the bean sprouts, limes, jalapeños, & mint leaves. But.......once that plate arrived at my table, I noticed that one of the two limes I got was ALREADY USED...I was so hungry & sick that I proceeded on trying out the pho anyway. Which leads to my next problem--the broth. Never did I ever have to put SO much Sriracha and hoisin sauce in my life. The broth was THAT tasteless.  I've eaten here about 5 times including this time & each time was just going downhill. Also, they are more expensive than the usual bowl of pho that you get in Chinatown. So definitely not worth coming here anymore. Even if I am starving!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast, delicious, super friendly. Great pho, rolls, tea... fried rice is overly greasy but tasty too. I've been here at least 5 times and only once did I notice the cigar shop smells from next door."}
{"text":"I was not happy eating there with my fiancé, I'm updating this review because we first tried it and I tasted his pho the meat looked old and pho broth flavorless. My bowl of egg rolls and noodles was bad I didn't like it all and it was not fresh."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pho. The broth flavor is delicious. If you dine in just look for seating in the back since its next to a cigar place and it can get smokey up front."}
{"text":"We normally eat Pho at another Las Vegas location but noticed Viet Bistro while driving in the area. We've been back many times and always find the food to be excellent and the staff very friendly. We've got a new Pho place!"}
{"text":"The grilled pork spring rolls were good but I found the Pho Dac Biet just mediocre. I ordered the x-large bowl which had more noodles then my cousin's large bowl - but with the same limited amount of meat. The  service was prompt and friendly. All in all, just an average Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"My new favoritest place to eat!!!  Because, because, be-caaaauuuse.... because of the wonderful things and phos.  The very best bun bo hue in all the land.  I could probably eat this dish almost daily and never tire of the rich, bursting flavorful goodness that delights my tongue with magical flavor tingles.  The wonton noodle soup is my second favorite dish here.  I didn't really have an opinion on the pho, as I've only had it once and remember it being good.    The staff is super cool and nice.  On my first visit the main guy in charge noticed my stiff shoulders and arms folded across my belly in an attempt to conserve my body heat and he immediately rushed to turn off the fans near my table.  On my second visit I totally butchered the pronunciation of bun bo hue, to which my waitress ever so politely corrected and assured me that it happened all of the time.  It probably doesn't, but I appreciated the fact that she was so nice about it.  Also, by the way, this particular visit was when my love affair with bun bo hue started.  I've had it many other places, but never quite this delicious and tasty.    The place is very clean and inviting, decorated with tasteful individual pictures of featured dishes above each table - not overdone and not like the Chinese take-out restaurants that have a wall of pictures of every dish offered with half the names misperred.  At first I thought the name to be somewhat of a contradiction, as Asian food and the imagery associated with \"bistro\" don't seem to jive.  But after dining there a few times, I realize that it works.  The space is fairly small and intimate, with approximately 10-15 tables.  Parking can sometimes be tricky if you try to visit on a week day around lunch time as it's located in a strip center that houses a variety of popular lunch spots.  Any other times, parking is a breeze.  Love, love, loooooove this place.  Go get yourself some of their delisherous bun bo hue NOW!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Vietnamese food, so I can taste the difference between good and bad bun bo hue.  The main reasons why I gave this place a one star was because:  1. The service was terrible. I was not greeted at the door or at the table until I got someone's attention 10 minutes later. Yes I did sit myself because I thought that was the norm, and yes I came in during business hours. Maybe they were playing hide-and-go seek with me. Who knows.   2. Perhaps they were trying to be hip, but the room was really dark... The only bright light came from the kitchen.   3. All the items on the menu were quite pricey compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown   4. I ordered the bun bo hue and received a few pieces of meat, noodle, soup, and bean sprouts. Keep in mind that bun bo hue should have banana root/blossom or at least red cabbage on the side, beef shank, pig's feet and pig's blood cubes inside the the soup.  You are better off making 10 cent ramen at home. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's hard to find a good vietnamese place. My friend and I came here in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday and it was pretty empty.  Atmosphere: the restaurant is pretty big. It could fit quite a bit of people. The waitress was really nice and patient while we decided what we wanted to eat.  My friend decided to try the Vietnamese sandwich. We both used to live in San Francisco so we had high expectations. The sandwich was definitely sub par. There was nothing great about it. The bread wasn't nicely toasted and the meats didn't quite work on it. It wasn't memorable whatsoever.   The BBQ vermicelli bowl on the other hand was delicious! I decided to get the bowl with the imperial rolls. It was delicious! It was very flavorful and tasted so much better than the sandwich and definitely made up for it. I would have given this place a 3.5 stars since the bowl made up for the sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is better than pho Kim long. The service is impeccable. The food is excellent. This place is a MUST try!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been more disappointed in a Vietnamese restaurant. I LOVE Vietnamese food and eat it wherever and whenever I can because it's so flavorful and fresh!  The Bay Area in Cali, Los Angeles, here all over,  so I don't rink I'm being picky or unnecessarily particular. It may have been my choice, but I felt like they were safe basics to try.  I had a vermicelli bowl which was OK. That had no picked vegetables but maybe I'm acting spoiled. The egg roll portions seemed small to me but they were edible. Definitely not the best but I wouldn't mind paying for them again.   The \"spring rolls\" though were another story altogether. I was so so so incredibly disappointed, and I had been craving these bad boys for weeks. I forced down one roll topped to the brim with peanut sauce and couldn't eat the other. A spring roll is NOT chopped lettuce with a shrimp, piece of pork all wrapped in a too dry rice roll. A spring roll,  in my experience,  is a little piece of spring's heavenly offerings all cuddled within a soft little rice roll like the better looking Asian adopted child of a burrito Mexican family. THIS WAS NOT THAT! I've had good and bad spring rolls,  in fairness different people have different tastes I get it,  but you give me some plain lettuce with a piece of shrimp,  pork patty and call that a spring roll?!  Where's the mint? Where's the noodles?  Where's the carrots or cucumber? Where's the SPRING in my roll? Put some other shidoobles in PLEASE! Anything, anything would improve this!"}
{"text":"Not a place to go if you don't like second hand smoke . Open roof vents next to smoke shop . U want into what smells strongly of Tobacco second hand smoke .the pho might be good who knows I couldn't stay long enough to order."}
{"text":"Disappointed the Yelp hours are not the actual hours. Checked in advance and arrived with 6 people. CLOSED. No hours posted. Sad face. Frustration."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Pho. Always hot and always good customer services they're fast too! They don't deliver but Postmates does!"}
{"text":"This place used to be in Monona and was called Kim's Noodles. They were getting good business out there and moved to the new location.   When it was still Kim's and when Viet Bistro first opened, it was great. The food was good and they gave good sized portions at a fair price. I'm not sure what the owner is trying to do, but every time I go there the portions get smaller and smaller and they try to cover it up by making the food look fancy and upscale.   Sorry, but you can't have crappy service, decent food, and small portions and expect to have happy customers. They get my order wrong every time I go there, even when it's not busy. Who serves an appetizer after the main course? I remember the days when they served good food at a reasonable price, now an order of calamari is 7 bucks and you get four pieces on top of wilted lettuce. The egg rolls are the size of my middle finger and I forget how much they cost because I never get them.   I always get the #1 pho and the Viet Bistro bahn mi. The pho is usually decent, it's good but nothing amazing. Rarely is it awesome, but I have been there when the broth was killer, even in recent times. I think it just depends on the chef. The pho portions are ok if it's not super busy. If it is busy, you're better off ordering a small bowl and at least getting your money's worth. Otherwise they will skimp you if you order a large or extra large if it's busy. The bahn mi used to be made with pate and they were good. Now they put scrambled eggs on it. I'm not Vietnamese but I have never had a bahn mi with scrambled eggs on it.   I really think the owner is trying to make it into a place that it's not, and he's ruining something that used to be good. If I were him I would just stick to making the dishes authentically as possible and offer them with good portions at a reasonable price. He's better off building a strong customer base and having good food than to try to expand and do too many things. I'm very disappointed in this place because it used to be good. The only reason I go back is because I'm hungover and I'm craving pho."}
{"text":"The manager is absolutely horrible has no personal communication between his two locations I don't understand how he is actually still in business"}
{"text":"I go here all of the time and I can't get enough of it!  I always call in to order and they are so fast it's insane.  It's like the jimmy johns of pho.  They staff are amazing and the food is just as good if not better and you can't beat the price.    Like I said before I go here all of the time and I will continue to do so. I recommend this to anyone who like pho."}
{"text":"We usually go to a different place for Pho. We were greeted right away and sat down. They are very nice there. Our order was taken in a timely manner and the food came out quick, hot and fresh 2 small chicken pho. There was plenty of chicken in the phone. It was delicious. We will come back again."}
{"text":"I am visiting Vegas and looked in Yelp for delivery restaurants, well it happens to be that you have to call Eat24 for delivery. The owner said to me don't worry I will make the delivery for you. I was moved and thankful that they did that. And he didn't even charge me for delivery!   Thank you very much for the delivery not just that but the food was really yummy!  Highly recommend ******* Thank you"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's my fav Pho place in the city...there is a smell of cigar smoke from the Tabasco Leaf cigar lounge next door but it's well worth it...I get the eye of round Pho...then pour Sarachi Hot Sauce All over it. They even give u real chopsticks rather than those yucca pencil like disposable ones!   ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Great food and Delicious Pha soup that my favorite, Family owned little joint, Great people great service, Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! We go here about once a week, staff is very friendly and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"This has been one of my bookmarks since I first drove by and saw the restaurant and I finally went to try it.  I generally get one of two dishes when I go out for pho and this time I stayed with the Bun Bo Hue.  I did not read the menu to see the pork hock on request and I had forgotten Paolo's review.    The menu states bun bo hue as follows: Hu's signature spicy beef noodle soup served in a slowly simmered lemongrass beef broth, with thick rice noodle, marinated beef shank, pork roll, beef tendon, pork hock (on request), and garnished with onion, cilantro, scallion.  The broth was very rich but there's no way it should have a red pepper by it on the menu.  It is not spicy.  I put all four jalapeño slices in the soup and a fair amount of Sriracha and it still wasn't spicy, but the flavor was good in spite of that.  I sure wish there had been more jalapeño slices.  Service was quick--I was the only person in the restaurant on an early Saturday evening--and the price was average for the size serving.  There was soft guitar (Vietnamese?) music playing and the name of the artist and album were on the screen.  It made a pleasant experience.  It's a place to which I'll return to try some other things."}
{"text":"Came here to try the bun bo hue based on all the recommendations. I came around 1400, after the lunch time rush. There was nobody in establishment. So, I was quickly seated and the server asked if I knew what I wanted. I told him the bun bo hue and later added the grilled pork meatball spring rolls.   First, I am nt an expert on bun bo hue by any means. My ratings relate more to the overall quality of the dish and not so much to the flavors. The smell and the taste of the soup didnt remind me of pork or beef, but of onions. It was tasty, but I felt it should have had more beef or pork flavor to it. Garnishes consisted of bean sprouts, slice jalapeno, and limes. No other herbs or greens were given. The slices of beef were chuck full of connective tissue. That's not a bad things since the meat was well braised and tender. They were skimpy with the meat however. The lack of beef is further emphasized by the fact there is no pork blood or pork hock in the soup. The only real plus of this dish was it was not too spicey and I was allowed to adjust the spiciness to my taste. The grilled pork meatball spring rolls were ice cold. I think they were made earlier and left to sit. They didn't wow me.  Not sure if I came too late and they ran out of ingredients or what, but was very disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Pho Virgin No Mo!  I picked Viet Bistro as my first stop for Pho based on location (in my hood) and Yelp reviews. It had been bookmarked to try for quite a while!  Chicken Pho full of fabulous flavor! I added jalapenos, bamboo shoots, basil and lime.  I ordered it sans cilantro and onions and it was perfect for this nasty cold I have.  The hubby had the Udon Noodle bowl with crabmeat and shrimp and also full of flavor and spicy too.  Eggrolls were delish, fresh and hot.  Thai Iced-Tea was the perfect blend.  Service Friendly.    Prices I think a bit high...$36 for two bowls, egg rolls and three iced teas.  The downer is that this place is in a strip mall located right next door to a stinky cigar shop...and yes sadly I could smell the smoke :(  Overall I don't think I would come running back because the cigar smell bothered me, but the food was well-made and full of flavor-maybe take out for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer when it comes to businesses in this commercial complex, and Viet Bistro stands on it's own for being surrounded by giants like Panera Bread, Market Grille, Chipotle, etc.    Service and the management were on top of everything, very polite, and professional.  Just like ther pho places I stick with the pho, especially with the upcoming winter freeze!    Even though my menu choices are aplenty with only 2 or 3, I know I don't have to try anymore to know that it probably wouldn't dissapoint.  So if you want pho and can't drive a couple miles to Spring Mountain, this is a really good spot out west to stop by!"}
{"text":"Had a long day so i thought I would finally get to trying this place.  Got the Banh Mi sliced porl sandwhich.  For 5 bucks you just cant beat it.  The flavors of the meat were great really hit the spot.  The only drawback I have is that I would like more meat and the carrot/onion mixture I like a lot more vinegar flavor in.  So Ill be back real soon just wondering if they will give me some Pho with nothing but tendon in it, am I the only one who likes tendon more than the other meats."}
{"text":"Hubby was craving some Pho.  Since we were down this way we were trying to decide on this place or Pan Asian.  Well, we've been to Pan Asian before and it was GREAT!  But we like to try new places.  This place is also located right next to the Cupcakery and another favorite place of ours, The Market Grill.  We walked in and there was just one other family seated.  The place was fairly small (going theme for most Asian restaurants).  We were joyfully greeted by what appeared to be the owner.  What a pleasant man he was.  The menu was big so, it took us a few minutes to decide.  We got: Veggie Pho (minus the tofu) for me Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) for hubby Chicken Pho (split between the kids) Bin Manh/Ban Minh??? (sliced pork sandwich)  Well, I gotta say, everything was quite delicious.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the sliced pork sandwich, too much fat for my taste--ack.  I even cringed when I peeled the sticky fat from the pieces of meat so I could eat them on the sandwich.  Yeah, I have a thing about fat on my meats...must be trimmed clean.  My 6 yr old and hubby thought it was great though.  The service was good.  Our cups never went empty.    There was an odor to the place (other than Pho broth smell).  It smelled a little smoky.  As in cigarette smokey, which we can't stand.  We couldn't figure it out but it faded eventually or we got used to it.  Overall, good experience and then we had dessert at The Cupcakery.  =)"}
{"text":"The online order feature through Yelp didn't work but I just walked in for take out. The service was fast and the pho was great. Large servings and delicious!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me preface this with the most important part: The food here is delicious. It really is. Probably the best Pho I've ever had, and I love the stuff. You can't go wrong with anything you order, it's all amazing.   So why only three stars? Sadly, it's because of the inconsistency of the service.    I used to come here for lunch with a group of about a half-dozen people from work about once a week, because we genuinely loved the food. But depending on who was helping us, the experience was either amazing, or a complete dumpster fire.   We were only ever helped by two people: Either a younger dark-haired gentleman (who might be the owner?), or an older gent in a baseball cap. If the former was helping us, we were in for a great lunch. He was welcoming, engaging, energetic, and usually even remembered our favorite orders. Drinks were refilled promptly, food came out fast, appetizers were hot and perfect, and everything was awesome - No worries. But if it was the latter guy working the dining room? Our shoulders slumped as soon as we walked in the door. Because we knew we were in for disappointment.   Now, I genuinely feel horrible criticizing the second guy, because it makes me feel like a culturally-insensitive bully. I don't want to pick on him. But the sad truth is, there were always significant problems with literally everything whenever he was our server.   To begin with, there is a significant language barrier there. And I feel like the worst white-privilege jerk alive for saying so, I really do...Since I guarantee you his English is way better than my Vietnamese. Props for even trying, but still. We quickly learned to point to things on the menu rather than ask for them in order to avoid the look of confusion we'd get. Which, honestly - at a restaurant with authentic international food operated by an immigrant family - is usually no big deal. But it quickly became one when the orders were still wrong regardless. You weren't guaranteed to get what you'd asked for.    But that wasn't the end of it. Some of us liked the specialty Pho bowls, but wanted one or two of the meats left out. So we'd special-order a bowl with brisket, flank steak, meatballs, tripe and tendon, and just ask for the tripe to be held. And this guy always argued - every time, without fail - saying that the bowl with just the flank and meatballs was essentially the same thing. We would try to gently dissent, saying that left two meats out of the mix. So he'd eventually agree. Buy then when the actual Pho showed up - Yep...Just flank and meatballs. Except, in more than one case it was flank and meatballs, but with tripe added IN even though it wasn't even a part of that bowl. But we'd grudgingly eat it anyway because it was still a hell of a bowl of soup. But one that nonetheless left a bad taste in our mouths for other reasons.  But there was more. A lot more. Drinks and water went un-refilled. Other meats would show up in the bowl that weren't wanted or ordered. Appetizers were ordered, but wouldn't arrive. Sometimes it took up to 45 minutes to get our lunch. He almost always neglected to bring out the basil, limes, bean sprouts and other garnish, even if we asked for it...you name it. It was just always a festival of ball-dropping. There were always multiple things wrong with the whole trip every single time; things the other guy always got right.   Eventually, we just started making other plans for lunch, since it was always a crapshoot as to who would be on that day, and we just weren't willing to risk it anymore.    Look, this is obviously a family-owned business, so I hate to criticize them. I doubly hate to ding them because they had the stones to come to a foreign country, open a business, and make it go. Huge props for that. And man...When they're on, they are ON. Like I said, probably the best Pho I've ever had. But when there's one person holding down the fort who just lets the standards of order accuracy, customer relations and service completely go right out the big, mirrored window...? It's just hard to go back, no matter how good the food is at least half the time.  Point is, you'll either be overjoyed, or disappointed here. Five stars for the food and service when guy one is in. Two for order accuracy and service when it's guy two. So - Average of three. I hope they address the service issues, though...We'd like to start coming back."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I visit it multiple times on every Vegas trip - and it's not like there is a shortage of restaurants here.  I have had so many dishes here.  While I am not a fan of Pho (I know, I'm a weirdo) everything else I've had here has been excellent.  Fresh and tasty with large portions.  The owner is such an awesome guy and is always on hand with suggestions if you need them.  He even made a regional specialty for my boyfriend that was definitely NOT on the menu.  I wrote a slightly more detailed review on my own Vegas blog so I am not going to go into tons of detail but - if you have a means to get here - please go.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Food is OK.  The house special Banh Mi is pretty good and was served with pho broth which was nice.  I've dubbed it a French Southeast-Asian Dip.  The bun noodles are not as chilled as I prefer.  They're out of some items. Service is slow.  It's nice to see a Vietnamese place in this part of town so I give it an A-OK rating.  I've had a lot better, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"I have to say, the Pho was much better than I expected.  Great broth base for the soup, and perfectly done rice noodles."}
{"text":"It was a cold morning, so I decided to go out for some bun bo hue for brunch today.  I was the first customer here and even though it is supposed to open at 10, upon my arrival, I was told that they weren't ready to serve until 10:30.  I came at around 10:20, so I didn't need to wait too long, but keep in mind to not come at 10:00 on the dot or else you'll be waiting 30 minutes.  Anyway, being Vietnamese and always living in places with exceptional Vietnamese food (San Jose and Orange County in California), my standards for Vietnamese food are ridiculously high.  However, I recognize that I am in Las Vegas and not in California, so I can't compare Vietnamese eateries here to those that I've had.  The bun bo hue here was decent - the broth had good lemongrass flavor and the right spices and heat.  I wasn't dehydrated from MSG nor was the broth exceptionally greasy.  But the meat cuts and accompanying veggies were lacking.  This definitely takes away from the authenticity.  There was also not enough meat, in my opinion.  The bowl is kind of small, so I would size up if you have a moderate to big appetite.  The service here is good, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The prices are fair - most things were between $7 and $12.  Portions are small to decent.  The menu had a good variety.  Although this is definitely not the best Vietnamese food that I've had, it is decent enough to satisfy a Vietnamese food craving."}
{"text":"The waiter did not wait on me.  He took my order and disappeared.  I don't believe the vegetarian soup is actually vegetarian. Tasted good though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location. I did not know there were other locations. I have one right by my house but I would rather drive to this location. I have a lot of allergies and the waitress went over the menu and what they could make for me. I went twice in the same weekend.   They were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Love this little hole in the wall! Plentiful choices, great prices! I keep it simple with Shrimp Pho & Tofu Spring Rolls.  I usually call my order in & its ready in less than 15 minutes... And that's during lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Hunting for spicy beef soup (bbh) with my girlfriend, we were on this side of town so we made a stop. Unfortunantly all the reviews are misleading. The bbh is really overpowered with lemon grass and sate oil. Call me spoiled but I have had this made the right way many times this wasnt right. They didnt even put the pork hock in it until my girlfriend asked. Just had to power through it because of my hunger. Service isnt really a factor here.  Maybe ill stick to pho on this side of town."}
{"text":"So I am bordering between 2.5-3 stars. I really really really like the broth but the to go portions are a little bit ridiculous for the cost. The noodle portion was smaller than the size of my palm and seriously it would probably fill a 5 year old up but not a 30 something year old woman and her hungry husband. You would think that their large pho would be pretty filling, but I think that might be their ploy to get you to spend more money on the extra large especially when they already charge more than a standard pho place in Chinatown. Yes, it isn't Chinatown but when I spend almost 30 bucks for two pho tais and an egg roll I expect it to fill me up. Their egg rolls need more lettuce. 2 tiny pieces of lettuce does not cover 4 egg rolls. I've been going back only because the broth is pretty good, but I go home to make more noodles. I'll have to see if the dine in portions are larger, but if you can help it don't get the to go because it is a kid size portion. Oh yea the beef is pretty good, but there must be more noodles!"}
{"text":"I was arround that area, I looked for pho at my yelp & found this place so I gave it a try. Regular bowl pho $8.99 & big size $11.99. Actually the regular size is already kinda big size for me ( a lot of broth). They have other food as well like rice dishes & appertizer like fried tofu, egg rolls ( 2 pcs = $3.50 ; 4 pcs = $6.50), shrimp spring rolls, satay, etc also if you want extra broth.. small size = $3 & big size = $5.  I order pho #5 which is rare round beef & meatball & my husband order Pho #7 which is rare round beef. I try the broth Before I mix the noodle and taste to salty for some reason after I mix the noodle & meat..the broth taste plain. I put more salt ; a lot of lime hot sauce, hoisin sauce & finally the taste like what I wanted which is spicy & sour  Also The beans sprout are not so fresh."}
{"text":"Very fresh veggies. The broth was very flavorful. No boba was the only sad note.  Easy to get to and plenty of parking.  Spring rolls were good and the peanut sauce was good."}
{"text":"my visit to this resto was disappointing. i like their food but for some reason it was not as flavourful as before. the service was slow and below average. the venue was hot, non aircondition. only ceiling fans. perhaps they were trying to make you experience vietnamese weather. i probably will think twice coming here again. better to go to another place and have real and authentic food."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pho and spring rolls. They forgot my spring rolls but gave me this noodle bowl and the chicken from the pho looked like it was in there fridge for a long time. Probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"The hell happened to you Kim's? If it wasn't known, the people who ran Kim's Noodles on Monona relocated here to Viet Bistro and its been the biggest inconvenience. Living on the northeast side of town, Kim's used to be within comfortable driving distance,especially after a night of heavy drinking. Their pho, although a bit bland, was a good friend to have, especially when all the condiments were all in front of you. Now, at Viet bistro, the condiments have disappeared. It wasn't much trouble to ask for fish sauce, chili paste and soy sauce but when you're having pho, you really shouldn't have to ask.  Their pho hasn't changed though, its still a very good dish.  Their other dishes are good but overpriced. My friend had fried rice and it cost her ~8 bucks. It was good, but not $8 good.  Their service is standard, they know when you're looking for water and are polite.  I've heard of a Bistro Bowl: a bowl of pho twice as big as their large size bowl from my friend, but I have yet to ask for it. Place is clean and very nice looking. Might be back, maybe just to see if they've improved."}
{"text":"Went to try this place today because it was closer than the usual place I eat pho at. Ordered a large beef pho and the soup was really watered down and just tasted like water with salt and mint. Had to add so much hoisin sauce and Sriracha to make it taste like anything. I ordered a Thai tea and never got it. Very expensive for the quality of the soup and service. Staff seemed unable to really handle the restaurant when it was busy. Definitely going to never return to this place. If you want amazing pho, you have to try Pho Mailan in Henderson. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is not great. We ordered pho dac biet and added wontons and the soup lacked so much flavor plus the wontons were nasty. Place smelled really bad and looks unsanitary. Only good thing is the egg rolls were edible"}
{"text":"My friend ordered some spring rolls while she waited for me to arrive. I arrived, sat down, and chatted for a bit and noticed no one came to take our order. We waited a few more minutes and no one. We kept on looking over and the two ladies were sprawled out comfortable in a neighboring booth with their noses in their phones the entire time. We put a bill on the table and left. We tried the sushi place next door and no one came up to greet or sit us. Third time is a charm and we ended up going to the Indian place in the same plaza. Wonderful service. Skip this pho place."}
{"text":"We love the food here and they were EARLY with their delivery!  My son and his friends swear by the sandwiches, they taste delicious! I love the pho.  Fresh, great tasting food"}
{"text":"This is a great little Viet place off Chinatown. The pho is delicious with tons of meat. The couple that run the place is personable and provide excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Lamb Eggrolls Meat rolls wrapped in Betal Leaf Shrimp on sugarcane Viet coffee comes already made, no neat contraption served on the table.   Loved that they had unusual ethnic items on their menu for us to order and try. Located outside of chinatown, we stopped here to dine, after a day of Red Rocks climbing. Normally we delve into the abyss of options available at Spring Mountain. Glad we made the stop here because we didn't miss out on authenticity factor.   Our waitress looked like a recent transplant and although she could understand our English she was still learning to speak hers.   The lamb egg rolls were the most memorable part of the meal. The gamey lamb flavor really stood out. 4 rolls for $7. I was also able to sample my friends meat rolls wrapped in Betal leaf. The taste was very different! Pungent spices all around.  I  was boring and had the pho, no complaints."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Hand down for my favorite in town.  Frist, they just opened like three months ago, so the interior design is very new, simple and clean.   Once I had Pho in here, i never come somewhere else. It's my favorite restaurant when i craving for pho! The broth is fantastic.   the owner is very helpful and friendly and funny. ask him any question if you are in mood to try something new, he always knows what you want."}
{"text":"The place is clean. The lady was my server and she was friendly and provided good service. I would rate this place higher if the bun bo hue had pig blood and pork feet in it. To me bun bo hue have to have all the ingredients. But the broth was still good. I ate it all. Only wish it had the ingredients I listed. The pho looked good here too. Probably have to come back to try the pho."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we've been here.  So we decided to go here since it's closer, instead of driving down to chinatown. This time was dissappointed.  The last time I was here I had oxtail pho and it was very meaty and delicious.  This time around the pho was still pretty good but a lot less meat.  Definately wasn't worth the $12 bowl."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich ever! Had it delivered and I was very excited when it showed but what a let down! The bread was like from subway! I expected that crunch bread as I'm used to. Will never come back for sandwiches here. Haven't tried the pho though...might be pretty good, might not..."}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue! Wow! For those History Buffs, Hue used to be the capital of Feudal Vietnam. So Hue dishes were dishes of the Emperor. What sets them apart from other regional cuisines in Vietnam is their relatively small serving size with refined presentation, a vestige of its royal cuisine.   But the star of Hue is the Bun Bo Hue, spicy beef udon. There are many places that claim to make Bun Bo Hue in Las Vegas, but I would only go to two, Bosa 1 and now Viet Bistro. The service at both these establishments puts all other Vietnamese restaurants to shame.   This review is really for all the Bun Bo Hue fiends out there, you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"If you go to an Italian restaurant and order chicken nuggets, you are bound to be disappointed. And also that is a stupid move. So why would you order Chinese dishes at a Vietnamese restaurant? Stick to the Vietnamese dishes like pho, bun, or banh mi and you won't be disappointed like all those other 1- and 2-star reviewers. They do the Vietnamese classics really well. Pho dac biet and bun bo hue are two of my favorite dishes and they do those well here. Check out their selection of banh mis as well and grab a Thai iced tea. Skip the Chinese fare; Ichiban Szechuan is a better choice for that."}
{"text":"I get scared while I try new things.  Luckily I'm 26 and not 66 so instead of yelling about change and being stubborn about new things while I watch diabetes commercials during the Price is Right, I man up and take action!  I liked the feel of Viet Bistro and the overall atmosphere was great.  I also got the feeling the waitress wanted me (to buy?) so that helped the experience as well.  I honestly have no idea what I ordered since I had no idea what anything was, but it was pretty good and I would love to try it again down the road.  The service was great and I have no real reason to hate the place.  Conditions for Me To Return: - Have the gf make her homemade pho then - be In the mood for pho"}
{"text":"There is a lack of Pho joints up in the North West part of town, so an Asian place that isn't Japanese or Chinese is more than welcome in my book.  Especially because I don't have to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain to get good Pho.  I would give this place a 5 but it's lacking in a few areas.    1) I'm from So Cal and I'm used to Pho costing you no more than $5 for a huge bowl.  All the Pho bowls here are hovering around the $8-9 range.    2) Its right next to a cigar shop.  The constant wafting of cigar smoke/odor makes into this otherwise cute restaurant.  The odor kinda turns you off a bit.     So for me that took away a couple stars.  Now onto the good stuff:  Great Food!  I had a vermicelli with grilled shrimp bowl ($9) and it was delicious.  Everything a good bowl should be: Fresh ingredients, delicious seasonings, and the right amount every time.  The grilled shrimp was superb and the noodles with the accompanying sauce blended well together.  I'd definitely order it again.    Good Location.  Located right off the 95, its a perfect location for a Vietnamese joint.  The options in the Northwest are commercial and predictable.  This was a breath of fresh air to me.  Sometimes driving all the way downtown is not an option and this is right up my alley.  Attentive Service.  The servers there are always very helpful if you can't decide what you want.  They are very attentive and ensure you have everything you need.    Would I go again. . .Yes."}
{"text":"The lady who was behind the counter was very rude and unfriendly. Not much of a personality at all! The Banh Mi that I ordered was not all that great. Most likely won't be back here again! Unless the lady (who is sadly, probably the owner) somehow finds a personality. Otherwise, not worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"Not the best Pho in town but it was close to home. My last visit was disappointing as my bowl of Pho wasn't even steaming as if they microwaved it before serving. Better just make the drive to Spring Mountain next time!"}
{"text":"The best Phõ in the city in my opinion! Staff is always very hospital and genuinely nice. No matter what time of day their broth is phenomenal! Highly recommend. Bring the family, and even if you don't like Phõ, they have a very large selection of traditional Vietnamese cuisines."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The smoke shop next door may have something to do with it. My Pho kind of tasted like smoke. Could have just been in the air, but still it was not a good experience for me. My hubby loved it though."}
{"text":"quick: Tiny bit pricier than most, offers nice service, delicious food and not a bad choice for Viet food if you aren't near spring mountain.  pros: offered extra pho noodles for free! manager is pretty attentive, secret spicy addon!  cons: not the cleanest, slightly more expensive, they don't use real broken rice =/  We walked in and the place is fairly modern, but had the smell of gasoline or fresh paint or something. It was pretty distracting.  The (I assume owner) greeted us, made recommendations and in general, we felt taken care of so that is a major plus in a Viet restaurant.  The quality of the food is standard but the portions are huge! The $6.50 regular pho bowl was the size of a large normally in my opinion, and it came with like 8-10 slices of beef! Seemed never ending. The special spices he offered also gave things a nice kick. The food flavor hit the spot but I'm not incredibly picky about my Pho. I love Pho, I find it hard to mess it up.  The Com Bi was a disappointment. The pork chop was good but the steamed egg cake was inedible, everyone at the table agreed. And the biggest offense was they don't use real broken rice.  Overall we enjoyed our meals here sans a few hiccups but good service means a lot. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love the Pho! I get the filet and my husband usually gets the ox tail. Always delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I have to give at least one extra star for the lady who served us super funny and nice and really helped us with the menu selections. But entering this place is like going into a cigar lounge I'm guessing because of the tobacco shop adjacent to the restaurant but it is overpowering and really nasty as I hate tobacco and the smell of it. The food wasn't very good at all the broth needed a lot of flavoring added to it and all the noodles just seemed to clump together in the bottom of the bowl in one large gross lump.  I added bean sprouts and Sriracha but I have to give the flavor and food a thumbs down. Make the trip to Saigon 8 is not far from here and the food tastes much better plus the selection is more varied. If you do happen to come to this location the P1 would be the only thing I would even bother ordering but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I just came back from DC and I ate the most delicious Vermecilli EVER!!!  I come back home hoping to find something as delicious here and OMG this place was a MAJOR disappointment.  Now I understand why it doesn't have 4-5 stars.  Even when empty the service is slow and lacking and the quality of the food, well.  Let's just say I won't be going back, not even to give them a second chance.  I know every restaurant has it's way of doing things but when you've tried something great, your expectations are high and this failed to meet those expectations in presentation, flavor, and freshness of the food.  Even the vegetarian rolls weren't as good as I hoped it would be.  They don't describe items in the menu and the explanation makes one feel dumb as one still does not understand.  So if you've never had Pho and don't speak Vietanese, don't come here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, tried to give them a chance but this is unacceptable. How I order food to go and it's cold ? Pulled right from a fridge and into a container. I will never go here again. Being Vietnamese myself, I can't believe they would try to pull off our cuisine. The nerve!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. I heard about it from a flyer left on my car. I had always gone to spring moutain to get really good Pho, but I was excited to see this place on our side of town. I tried a couple of items, the shrimp rolls in rice paper were wonderful and fresh and I loved the peanut sauce. There was also a selection of different types of non-alcoholic drinks meant to referesh the palate. I tried the ginger iced tea lemonade and it was wonderful I had never had anything like it and can't wait to have it again. I had the special PHO with the satay and it was yummy, a nice spice but not too spicy. The prices were very reasonable and everything was fresh. I can't wait to go back and try the other items."}
{"text":"Really yummy pho place.  The broth is flavorful and light and they package everything perfectly to go.  They used to deliver but then they stopped :(  If the owners are reading this - please start delivery again for winter!  The best cure for the cold is a big bowl of pho with sambal.  It will clear your sinuses right up!"}
{"text":"Yummy pho! And the people are so nice. I was sick when I went and just wanted some yummy pho. The woman who took my to go order clearly knew I wasn't feeling great. While I waited - just a few minutes - she gave me a nice cup of tea, and gave me a large to go cup when I left of the tea. Very sweet. And the pho was great - packaged very nicely as well - and tasted just great. A wonderful cold remedy!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. I ordered delivery and when it came my pho smelled strange and when I tried it it was SO OILY, I put it in the fridge and went on with my day. Came back and remembered that oil hardens when it's chilled so I wanted to see how much there was in my soup and THIS IS WHAT I PULLED OUT. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Order the egg rolls it's freshly made and delicious. The oxtail was a failure we received 3 pcs of tail in our bowl. We complained to our waitress the lady said it was big in size which was not true. The place needs a lot of cleaning especially on the class door and windows area. The price was a little bit expensive compared to other places. Our oxtail soup was 12 bucks which is 9 bucks or less in other places. The grilled pork that we ordered was a little bit burnt with black residue. The service was good but not worth higher marks.  Overall all you can go to other Pho places near your place and get the same or better quality food. My wife and I are not coming back thats the bottom line."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Bun with the combo BBQ pork and Shrimp. Tasty, but skimpy on the meats and was loaded with too many bean sprouts and cucumbers. Thai Tea was too sickeningly sweet compared to others I've had. Host was very pleasant, waitress a little snotty - in total average service. Prices were slightly high. Tables too close together. All in all, not bad, but no need to go back, I'll try somewhere else. Would give three stars if there was a little more meet in the dish."}
{"text":"I did something different today. Whenever I try a Vietnamese place for the first time, I usually get the combination pho. It's my baseline dish for comparing Vietnamese restaurants.  But thanks to My T's review, I just had to try their Bun Bo Hue. It's something I've never ordered before, so I have nothing with which to compare. That's really not a problem, of course. In the end, I enjoyed the soup. My friend, Lisa Y, says it's not her fave BBH in town. As for me, it was pretty darn good. I loved the tenderness of the beef. It wasn't very spicy--from what I understand, BBH is supposed to be spicy--but it had a nice hint of heat that enhanced the flavor without the usual runny nose effect.  I should point out that the bowls did not come out with pig feet. I asked about them and they brought a couple right out. I guess they figure that pig feet probably don't appeal to non-Vietnamese people, but it's listed as part of the dish on the menu! Anyway, that's a minor complaint.  The one weird thing about this place is the lighting. It's fluorescent, but many of the panels are blue, while a couple of them are orange. They just give the place a strange hue. Obviously, it's not a reason to avoid the place. But as a photographer, it's something that caught my attention."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I got started on a short-lived Bun Bo Hue kick. Coincidentally, the catalyst was reading My T's review of the original Viet Bistro location. I tried a few around town and enjoyed them with varying degrees, but I think my favorites were Viet Bistro and the former Bosa 1.  So I think it's appropriate that the first thing I tried at the new Viet Bistro is the BBH. Dare I say it might be the best I've ever had. I have no idea if it's authentic. I just know that I enjoyed it all the way down to an empty bowl.  It's certainly not perfect. For starters, the broth was more sweet than spicy. I'm not sure if I got the \"non-Viet\" treatment or if that's how it is. Digging up my old review, the BBH up north wasn't spicy either. This time around, I made sure to specifically ask for the pork hock--their menu actually states that the pork hock is only included by request.  One thing I don't like about BBH is the noodles. They are thicker and aren't as easy to eat compared to pho noodles. Last night, the noodles seemed overcooked to the point that they were falling apart. But strangely, this made them easier to eat, so it worked out great!  There aren't really any pho places in the Summerlin area. The news of a Viet Bistro opening in this part of town is highly welcomed as it's a quick jaunt down the 215. With a solid BBH checked off the list, I'm eager to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are incredible!  Best lunch value in LV.  The service is wonderful.  I have never had a bad time at Viet Bistro.  Unfortunately the parking lot is crowded, parking is not easy."}
{"text":"Very average Vietnamese place but I wont blame you if you come here because you live around this area and are too lazy to drive down spring mountain.  They could give a bit more meat in their pho dac biet and the bun bo hue looked pretty awesome but was a bit on the bland side.  Whats really lame is their chao tom spring rolls because the shrimp paste was about the size of a 5 year old's pinky.  Dont skimp out on the meat man!"}
{"text":"I loved this place it was our first Pho experience and the gentlemen that hosted us made sure we enjoyed and understood everything he even made a special dish for my 6 year old daughter. The food and customer service was amazing two things hard to come by in the same place id totally recommend it and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared orders of shaking beef and seafood crispy noodle at this small, informal restaurant.  The seafood crispy fried egg noodles were very good.  Though the shaking beef was good, the beef itself could have been more tender.  After paying the bill we returned to the South Point Casino and shortly thereafter I discovered I had left my credit card at the restaurant.  By the time we called the restaurant was closed, but the owner took the call on his cellphone and confirmed he had the card and we could pick up the next day."}
{"text":"So far it's the best pho that I've had in Vegas, I'm pretty critical of pho because I come from Orange County, so it's hard to give them a five star review unless they really blew my mind. Minus points for the business hours on yelp not being accurate. When I rolled up at 8:55pm one night, the worker yells at me that they are closing in five minutes. On my way out, I tell her that her Yelp page says they close at 10:00pm, she kinda just shrugs it off lol"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! There are some vietnamese restaurants in China Town that are way better but: hey - this one is really close. So why not?"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Lamb egg rolls unique and right up my ally. Smiles and good food. Yum"}
{"text":"Well the place smelled like an ash tray due to the cigar joint next door, as we looked at the menu the wait her was sitting at a table behind us eating and slurping his pho, almost walked out but gave it a try, the chicken pho I ordered was ok, they served a plate of basil and sprouts the basil was rotted I left totally grossed out, won't be back"}
{"text":"The first time I tried pho was in Washington state, ever since I fell in love with the dish al the flavor in one bowl when I came back to Vegas I didn't know if I was going to find anything half as good and this place is amazing. The food is amazing the service is great super friendly and the last time I was there I was given a delicious ginger lemonade that's to die for I would go back just for a gallon of that lemonade! I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes like everybody says the cigar smell is strong when you first walk in but the deeper you go in the restaurant the less it will bother you!!"}
{"text":"For the only Pho option in Summerlin, this place is really not bad.  We come here rather often to save the drive to Chinatown and it's pretty convenient right off the freeway (215 & Flamingo).  Most plates are priced between $9-12 and the sandwiches are about $6.    The broth is very light and doesn't have a lot of MSG like other places in Chinatown.  The dishes here are closer to home style pho rather than commercial recipes.  On certain days, they even have a vegetarian broth pho but they make very little of it so they run out often.    The main challenge here is the language barrier with the servers.  Unless the owner Kevin is here, the staff usually speak minimal English, e.g. enough to take the food order and bring either water or hot tea.  If you have any questions beyond a straight order, I recommend keeping Google Translate handy."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst vietnamese restaurant in town. I'm a person that what to try different places,  but take my words. SAVE YOUR MONEY. . Just head down to Spring Mountain for some better vietnamese food than this place. I'd ordered the nem noung springrolls. It had more lettuce than meat (where's the beef) and the lettuce was wilted. I also ordered the pork chop with the egg quiche and shredded pork (Com suon bi cha) first off the rice was over cooked, the egg quiche was half frozen,  the pork chop was so thin that I was asking myself that's it?... It's the worst $17 I spent on my own culture food. Ugghh..i would have a better meal having instant noodles with eggs and hotdogs."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place and just had to see for myself.  Delicious!  Tried the Bun Bue  since everyone recommended it and was not disappointed.  Told my husband to make a mental note if I were to get sick and requested some yummy soup.  We also tried the Korean ribs (yum) some porkchop dish the server recommended (my fav) along with the BBQ pork sandwich (needs a little more meat).  Very good and great prices to match.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was mad craving for pho and I was not tryna go all the way to Chinatown to get some. Glad I saw this on yelp because this was only less than 2 miles away from my house.  Came here for lunch. Was seated immediately. Plenty of tables and was not as busy. The pho menu was on the second page. Saw what I was looking for which was the P1 combination. Of course gotta get a large! Price was cheap too!   My girl got some kind of beef and rice combo. Food arrived in a descent reasonable amount of time. Presentation was beautiful. Could not wait to dig in!   Drenched my pho with that sprouts, jalapeño, lime and siracha! Mixed all those babies up!   Every single sip and bite was...  glad I found this place. The beef and rice combo was superior too. Tender and juicy with onions and peppers.   Overall experience was fantastic. I was very satisfied of my meal. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Great space but the food was not. I went with the group of people for lunch. My noodles were under cooked and the meat was overcooked in the soup I ordered , so both were very chewy. Egg rolls were okay, crispy but a little bland."}
{"text":"This was a different experience. Although the food was decent, the service was a bit awkward. I understand there was a language barrier but I really didn't understand why they did some things they did:  1.) once we walked in they told to take any seat. We did but had to wait for someone to come out and give us menus. We honestly waited for 10 minutes for menus, there was only one other table. After waving the guy down to get his attention he just waved back as if he was saying hi.   2.) when ordering, we asked if we could keep one menu in case we wanted to order more, and he took all of them back.   3.) I ordered a Diet Coke and he brought back a half of a Coke.  I know it was really just the language barrier so I don't want to be mean about it. The food was good! The chicken Banh Mi was probably one of the best that I've had!"}
{"text":"If you need a Vietnamese fix in Summerlin this is the place to go.  My friend and I were in the mood for some Bun (vermicelli rice noodle dish) and we decided to try Viet Bistro, I'm really happy that we did.  We were greeted at the door by Kevin the owner, he's very nice and took great care of us.  We ordered fresh shrimp Summer Rolls and fried pork Spring Rolls for appetizers. I ordered grilled Pork Bun for my main, and my friend got the grilled Chicken Bun.  Summer rolls came up first. They were fresh and tasty, but not exceptional. The paper-thin softened rice paper is stuffed with shrimp, pork, cabbage and a small amount herbs. The peanut sauce they come with is ok, but we asked for some fish sauce with them which was better. I would have liked a bit more fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro, or something) with these because they were just a bit bland.  Next came the friend pork spring rolls, wow they were really good. These are served in traditional Vietnamese style with lettuce and cilantro to wrap around the fried roll, and fish sauce for dipping. What made these great was how crispy the fried outer roll was. It's such a great texture and flavor combination to roll up the fried spring roll in lettuce with the cilantro inside, then dip the whole thing in fish sauce. Yummy!  Next came our main dishes, grilled pork and chicken bun bowls. This is a dish that I really love, but it needs to be done right. I've been disappointed the last few times I got this dish at places in Chinatown due to soggy overcooked noodles, burnt/overly charred meat, or not-so fresh veg.  Viet Bistro does Bun proper. The noodles were a perfect al-dente with amazing texture, the bean sprouts and other veg were crisp and fresh, the grilled pork was caramelized to perfection, and it had just the right amount of fresh herbs.   If I have to nit-pick for a con, I would say the fish sauce could be a bit stronger. It's good, but tastes a little watered down compared to how I normally like it.  Overall, this place is an easy 5 stars for the food and friendly owner/host.  Side note:  Upon entering this place I immediately smelled very strong cigar / pipe tobacco smoke. I asked the owner why it smelled and he explained it was the cigar shop next door. He seated us in the back where the smell was not so bad. There is also outdoor seating which I would recommend if you are sensitive to the smell of smoke.  It's unfortunate that the cigar shop next door is polluting the surrounding restaurants and shops. There's a cupcake shop on the other side of the cigar shop, and it has the same issues with the smoke smell. The guys at this cigar shop should be using better ventilation or something."}
{"text":"After enjoying the original Viet Bistro location on Lake Meade, I was pleased to see this new location open in West Summerlin.   The food here is excellent.  Seasoned Beef Roll with Betel Leaf appetizer is delicious, you can get it \"roll your own\" style or ask for them pre-rolled. One of my favorite dishes here.  I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese vermicelli bowls, and Viet Bistro always prepares them perfectly. Noodles are cooked just right, meat is well trimmed and marinated, vegetables are crisp and the aromatic herbs are fresh. I like these bowls so much that I have not even tried the pho here yet.  I'm taking a star off because the service at this location was pretty much non-existent.  The guy who took our order disappeared into the back and never came back out. Our food was brought out by another guy who was talking on the phone while he handed us our plates. This dude stayed on the phone the entire time we were there. He brought our check while still talking away on his phone.  If this place can get it's act together with the service it would be an easy 5 stars. Hopefully this experience was just a one off."}
{"text":"I have been looking for pho and found a hole in the wall place that serves ox tail pho. Broth amazing.  Grilled pork sandwich excellent as well.  Iced coffee the best in town.  Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a good dinner with my wife. This is the 2nd time I've eaten here. Although, this time the Fresh Spring Rolls weren't quite as \"fresh\" as I'd like. The wrappings were a bit chewy and the filling was all lettuce with a few shrimp. But, the dinner was good and made up for it. We had a combo bowl with a little bit of everything in it over rice noodles. Service is good and everything is clean. Although the rolls Arny the best I've had, the meal is overall quite good and since its convenient, I'll continue to eat here when I feel like a quick and good meal."}
{"text":"This place right next to a cigar shop. So while waiting to order all we could smell was the cigar smoke from next door. Food was okay. We only had Pho combination and spring roll so not much I can say. Service is pretty slow compare to other pho place I been to not to mention we were pretty dismissal by both host and waitress not because their way to busy or anything. She manage to go come by the table next to us and ask how they were doing and refil their water twice. We on the other hand had to ask if we can get out Pepsi refil. I should be use to it by now because most of the time this is how asian place treat other asian. Their face light up beam up when white folks walk in. I hate to pull this card and it's sad but true."}
{"text":"This is actually a pretty good place to eat pho! Only knocking down 1 star because when you walk in you're met with a pungent smoke smell. Which can be dampening when dining in. I forgive them anyway because they are located next to a smoke shop. I can't wait to try the other items on the menu and I wish they were open longer instead of closing at 9 lol"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and both experiences haven't been good. I'd rather take a few more minutes to drive to China town. I feel like the business could care less that your there when you walk in and it's empty.  I also asked for extra sauce and their attn to detail is lacking."}
{"text":"Not too bad. I got the vegetable bowl without tofu. And it was pretty good. My sister-in-law got the combination bowl and she finished the whole bowl. My mom got the beef bowl. She liked it but her meat had a lot of fat. She also got the Thai tea which was delicious. The pricing isn't bad either. Service is a little interesting. But I will come back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"I'm glad that we finally have a pho place on this side of town... The menu looks great and has many different options..  I had been to the other Viet Bistro location before so I came in expecting really good fragrant broth. I don't know if it's because I got shrimp pho but I was not a fan of this location's broth at all. I did enjoy the shrimp and pork salad which was basically like a naked spring roll!  The service was ok but there was a major language barrier as the server barely spoke any English.."}
{"text":"I was way out in the northwest today and decided to try a Pho place up in this area.  So based on YELP, I tried out Viet Bistro and walked away very happy.  1.  If you haven't read My T. or Paolo D review of this place yet, do so.  I used it for my analysis and visit and I was happy!  2.  Parking - strip mall, very easy.  Odd that it is near a cigar bar, which has a very distinct cigar aroma, however, once inside the restaurant, you cannot smell the cigars.  3.  Ambiance - Small narrow place, with purple walls. Nice overall.  Small and cozy. Nothing fancy.  4.  Drinks - I always prefer fountain drinks and they do have this over the canned sodas, so definitely a plus.  5.  Food - Ahhh,  I tried the Bun Bo Hue based on MyT an Paolo D review an it was great. It was not too spicy at all, and in fact, was very subtle.  This is great as it is not too overpowering and you can always add more spices or the jalepenos.  The noodles were just right in terms of texture and firmness.  The serving size was just right and this is the first time that I drank so much of the broth. It was very, very tasty.  My son had P11 and he enjoyed it as well as with an Iced Coffee.  I also ordered to sandwiches to take home and they taste great and better yet, the aroma is even better.  There is a ton of stuff on this menu. I will come back again, although it is about 35 minutes from where I live in Henderson!!!  6.  Service - As good as it gets.  GK says, check it out."}
{"text":"Eh... The first time I came here, everything was good. Had the oxtail pho, and it was amazing. The prices are a bit more expensive than the other pho places, but considering the location, it's to be expected. Came here again, had the shaking beef w red rice and the bun bo hue. The beef was flavorful, but the rice was pretty bland. It seemed like some sort of tomato rice. The bun bo hue was not really spicy, and it was rather lukewarm. Very disappointing! When we asked for bowls to share our dishes, the server brought out four different looking and sizes bowl... It was really weird. This might be a mom and pop shop, but I couldn't have possibly be the first one to ask for bowls!?"}
{"text":"Oh Kim's Noodle, why did you move from Monona? I guess to be where the students are. Don't lose your soul in the transition..."}
{"text":"If you live in the South Summerlin part of town and you're seeking some good Vietnamese food, then this is the place to go. My daughter had the Pho Combination bowl and it's actually really good! They have Oxtail Pho and it is delish! This place is also clean and have a nice atmosphere unlike the places over off Spring Mountain/China Town area. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp spring rolls and chicken egg rolls...tasted fresh and light...good. For pho had chicken and a seafood bowl...both were enjoyable. Would come back again for more"}
{"text":"First time the BF and I dropped in I grabbed bun with pork, shrimp and eggroll. Their bun is really good. The eggroll was nice, the pork and shrimp had a nice marinade and was cooked to juicy. The noodles were blanched just right and the veggies below were very fresh. The BF had the curry and while it was full of mixed veggies and chicken, he didn't really like it. I tried a bit later at home and it tasted more like gravy than curry and I thought it was okay, but not something I would order again.   We weren't feeling so great this week and came for their vegetable and tofu pho. I don't think they have vegetarian broth here or if they do it's not on the menu. There was a lot of broccoli, carrots, bokchoy and tofu in it so they didn't skimp on that which is nice and the sprouts and basil and the \"saw leaf\" that came to the table was very fresh. The broth was a bit too heavy with white pepper and star anise though. It did the trick with helping my sore throat, but it was abit overpowering of a flavor that I don't prefer. I hope that this isn't the usual and was just an off day...I would give it a chance again.    I generally think the quality of ingredients here is better than the standard and because of the location far from any competition, the prices reflect both things so keep that in mind. People get so used to dirt cheap pho that you may feel it's expensive even though most items are below 10 bucks. I think the service is decent, and friendly both times and seem family run.   I say, come for the bun / rice plate , but some of the other things I'm not too sure about. I'm sure we will be back. Sometimes we just don't want to drive all the way from Centennial to Chinatown to get some Viet food."}
{"text":"My family and I are new to Vietnamese food, and we loved this place.  My wife's banh mi was served with a broth that really added to the flavor.  My bon bo hue was very good, and more than I could eat.  My wife loved the Thai iced tea.  The service was excellent, and the place while small was very comfortable.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho spot! Always fast and friendly service. I am here so frequently they know my order lol. The broth is perfect and unlike others I've tried it's not greasy so no upset tummy! I'll never go anywhere else"}
{"text":"I can't move!  Writing this as we sit and wait for our food only because there was one thing that stood out so strong about the place. The strong smell of cigar inside this small little 11 table restaurant. It's because of the cigar place next door. MAN is it strong. Ventilation has to improve for me to be able to properly rate this.   Located in a Plaza on Lake mead and , the parking here is crazy full. So set just enough time to get a proper parking spot where you don't to have to walk.   So, like I mentioned in my header, it is small inside. 11 tables @ a probably of max 30 people and 4-5 people per table at their biggest table. So if you have a big group, you may want to call ahead so they can combine tables. As for their single table, it's pretty small as well. Condiments take up some space, and as soon as drinks, appetizers, and food come, your all out of realestate.   What we ordered: 2x P1 Combination phone with rare steak, flank, tendon, meatball, and tripe.  Fried tofu appetizer  Thai tea with boba to go.  The tofu was cooked very well. Nice golden seasoned crust with their special sauce. Yummy! The pho is good. In fact it's not bad at all. Meat proportions is just right, I love their tendon here, noodle is the perfect length, and the soup base has the right consistency of flavor. Satay sauce is a bit more spicy than we are used to, but it worked.   Customer service is great. Seated eight away even thought limited seating, but was served and taken care of from beginning g to end. Greeted and thanked.  Overall, this is definitely a come to place for us. Doesn't beat our favorite Photos Saigon 8, but definitely the runner up when we don't feel like making that trip to spring mountain.   I would definitely rate this higher if the cigar smell did not linger. Otherwise, we found a new pho spot to eat at."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. So I did notice the price increase as well. But they're delicious regardless."}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times when I don't feel like heading down Spring Mountain and it doesn't disappoint.   I usually go with the pho tai (rare ribeye) and a classic Vietnamese grilled pork sandwich.  Stay away from the fresh spring rolls as the one time I got them it was pure lettuce and shrimp...no mint, basil, vermicelli noodles or cilantro, like wtf...I guess they were out.  A couple hiccups here and there...  -Occasionally water glass goes empty and the waitress doesn't notice (and there's no one else eating) -No cilantro or shredded carrot in the sandwich the last time I got one...pretty staple ingredients in a Vietnamese sandwich, no? Guess they were out that day too.  What works...  -Location is great (for me!) -Friendly service -Never super busy -Decent food that'll satisfy your Pho craving -50% Discounts online if you search...(hence my 4 star bump from a 3)"}
{"text":"Clean and Delicious Pho and Egg Rolls. I liked the Flank but not the Brisket (too much tendon) but overall great service and they even put on a cartoon for my son. If you like the cleaner taste you will enjoy this. It doesn't have the heavy msg aftertaste as most pho places have. Their special hot sauce is the bombdotcom if you like spice."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here at reasonable prices.  I've been here a couple of times, and have tried the pho, noodle bowls, pork dishes, etc.  None of the food I've had has been mind blowing but always good.  Convenience here is key, since this is probably the closest Vietnamese anywhere near my house in the NW area.  Service is fairly quick too, so it's a good spot to grab lunch if you work nearby.  I'd recommend stopping in when you are on this side of town and need to get your fix!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write good reviews because I want to help people when they dont know the places and need to make choices . Today just happened to be in the area , unexpected found this place so decided to give a try .  The seafood fried noodle sauce was too sweet , barely see any seafood except three small shrimps and squid burried underneath the veggies , also too much MSG taste in the sauce . The service was nice and attentive . The restaurant is located next to the cigar shop so there is a strong cigar smell when you walk in . Overall , if you are craving for a Vietnamese food , go to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"not too shabby, but i have had better vietnamese food in china town and even in the rainbow/215 area. if you are in the lake meade/rainbow area, then i would go ahead and get some grub."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of pho and an Arnold Palmer. Pho was tasty and what made it better was that we didn't need to make a drive all the way to Chinatown.   The drinks were not good. My Arnold Palmer (which is half iced tea and half lemonade) was bright orange resembling an orange Fanta. I tasted it and it was like they spilled the iced tea mix into my glass. I then ordered the ginger lemonade which was too sweet and tasted mainly of syrup. I finally asked for a water and was really grossed out when I saw that the server was carrying a tub for dirty dishes around and did not wash his hands before pouring us water."}
{"text":"I am kind of a pho expert. Being vietnamese and all. =D. lol.   Anyway, for a restaurant, this place comes as close as it gets to resembling my mom's pho. And I've been to pho places all over vegas, nor cal and LA. After reading some of the other reviews, I've decided to give their bun bo hue a try. Which generally is not a soup that I like (I'm white-washed for a viet), but let me just say, that I would like bun bo hue a lot more if Viet Bistro made it for me each and every time. After taking many friends here on different occasions, I was able to try different things. Like their amazing roast pork spring rolls (looks like slices of spam but tastes amazing!), and their sandwiches, the famous banh mi's (so good!).   I only wish they had a location in city center, so that I don't have to drive all the way out there =D."}
{"text":"Very good broth but just because we come in 45 min before you close doesnt mean you can be a jerk and give bad service.. food came out quickly and maybe ill give it another shot OH by the way i ordered oxtail soup which says $9 on the menu.. when i got my check they charged us $11 didnt want to say anything about it so i just paid it but thats why you got a lower tip because i added the extra $2 you charged me to your tip...Dont be scam artist guys customers dont appreciate it"}
{"text":"Got the Bun Dac Biet and Pho Dac Biet.  Both were tasty but the Bun wins out with how the meat was grilled.  Will be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We were craving pho and got excited to find this place nearby. As soon as we walked in we noticed the very unpleasant blue lighting inside and when we were about to be seated we noticed a very foul smell that was overwhelming and disgustingly pungent. We couldn't even make it to our table before turning around and leaving."}
{"text":"Took the Bin Bo Hue and some spring rolls home. Bin Bo was boring at best. I would say more if the spring rolls weren't so toxic. First bite only stayed in my mouth for a second! Sorry about that image. The shrimp were past their use by date by at least 2 weeks. That the (cook) didn't smell the biohazard smell coming off of them may  explain the rest of the food. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm willing to give this place another try and another rating only because the dish I had was Chicken Pho and many other reviews have  exhilarating reviews about other dishes such as the Bah Mi or rice dishes.   I had high hopes for my Pho but was sadly disappointed. I can't explain it better than it had a funky taste to it. Nough said- hopefully better luck next time."}
{"text":"Super bummed, I was so badly hoping that one of the only Vietnamese spots near my house would have some stellar pho, but unfortunately it didn't. I passed by this joint a number of times, but never stopped in. Was feeling under the weather and thought what better than a delicious hot bowl of pho to give me some relief. I went in about 45 minutes prior to closing, and it was empty with the exception of a group of four people sitting down to eat. I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who I presume was the owner. We spoke briefly after I ordered my pho to go about the spice and how much I enjoyed spicy foods, the spicier the better for me. The restaurant was very clean. He gave me extra jalapeños and some of his extra spicy sauce. When I got home I couldn't wait to delve into my delicious pho, but immediately noticed that it had a different smell than I'm used to. It was a bit pungent to be honest. Whatever, I still wanted to give it a shot, so I put my fixings in and.......ugh it simply was not good. The broth had a sort of sweet taste to it, and just didn't mix well with the fixings. I added sprouts, jalapeño, onion, some lime, and some spicy sauce. Not even the sauce could take away that bitter sweetness. Needless to say this wont be my spot for pho. The three stars are for the cleanliness of the restaurant, the super nice owner/gentleman, and the simple fact that I only tried the pho, nothing else. I may go back to try another dish just based on the customer service."}
{"text":"I would rate the food at a 4 and the inside a 2... the cigar store next door just makes the inside reek. Combined with food its not a great place to try and sit and enjoy your meal. I do love grabbing some bahn mi sandwiches to go from here, I can't really sit and eat inside."}
{"text":"So happy that there is a place in my neck on the woods that has pho! FINALLY! Great pho and summer rolls. Nice atmosphere, clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place should definitely have people working that can speak English. I don't mean no disrespect but if we order pho and you come out with a sandwich, then that just makes us even \"hangrier\" than we initial came in. We were crunched with time but wasn't feeling the sandwich to begin with, so we ended up waiting even longer. The place is super quiet, meaning there's no background music and not busy at all, like our usual pho spots. The food was okay, but since the prices are more expensive than other establishments, I'd say go elsewhere. I don't know if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"The two stars I will be giving is for the food. It's a good portion sized meal and it was delicious! Second, reasons why I gave them a low rating is because the second you walk in, the whole place smells like an absolute ashtray. I'm not sure if the cooks smoke in the back or its the smoke shop next to it but they need to fix that problem asap! I could not eat the rest of my meal and I had to take my food home. Kinda sad because the staff was also very nice"}
{"text":"The location is perfect and close to my office so if I'm craving for some pho, I can easily get my fix.  It's in the same strip mall as Panera, Cupcakery and Market Grille Cafe.  The pho was good and had lots of meat in it.  The broth was not as flavorful as I'm used to but for the price and convenience, I'm satisfied.  Their Thai Iced tea is also good.  They have many other items on the menu so I have to try those as well.  Service is good and food came out quick.  It's great for those like me grabbing a quick lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Relatively clean environment. Average prices. Good service.   Pho tastes good. Soup is served hot, flavorful, without being over seasoned. Noodles are cooked at the right consistency.   I recommend the spring rolls w/pork, but must ask for peanut sauce. Thai iced tea and iced coffee w/condensed milk are on par."}
{"text":"My first time here today. So the name of this place is Viet Bistro, and they have the word cuisine on their sign. So I was under the impression it would be a little pricier and a bit fancier than the ones in Chinatown... I was wrong on the fancier part. They need to lose their overused utensils. They looked 10 years old. The pho was ok, but broth was not hot enough to cook the bean sprouts. Overall experience was 1/5. Food was 2/5 I will not be back for sure"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area so decided to stop in and try their thai iced tea and a bbq pork sandwich.  The tea was okay, although a bit on the weak side.  I didn't care for the sandwich...way too much cilantro for me and also quite dry. Little to no taste of bbq, so don't order this expecting a bbq sandwich that you might be used to, because this ain't it.   I wouldn't order a sandwich again.  Total for a not very large Thai ice tea and sandwich:  $10.50.  Too pricey for what you get (or don't get).   Maybe they have other things that are better?  On the positive side, the smoky air a lot of people complain of (coming from the cigar store next door), really didn't seem to be much of an issue.  There's a slight hint of smoke in the air but not much at all, and they had an air purifier machine thing in the front of the shop by the cash register, so that probably is helping."}
{"text":"Ordered Take our service was good. I've had better Pho. Too Salty. Maybe I'll try again."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Service was not good. Disappointed. Perhaps was the food items we ordered.. maybe should have tried other items."}
{"text":"This is solid Vietnamese food in Summerlin! It's so close to my house that when I'm craving pork vermicelli or pho and don't want to head all the way to Chinatown, this is a great alternative. I also think the portions are decently large for the price. I also enjoyed the bun bo hue here, (I am not Vietnamese so I can't speak to the authenticity) it was decently spiced/spicy and had good chewy noodles, it just wasn't red as I have had before. They are missing some things on the menu that I usually see at other Vietnamese places, but they have quite a few selections which is nice. If you dine in, they serve soup with their banh mi too. The inside used to smell like a smoke shop, which was really annoying, but it's improved a bunch."}
{"text":"Take a look at this food. It taste amazing I'm from ca and grew up in Westminster. You can go bad with Vietnamese \"well you can\" but not here"}
{"text":"Just a word of caution if you are ordering Pho through the delivery service... don't do it. According to Kevin it is standard procedure to send the broth cold and the meat frozen so you will have to cook it yourself when you receive your order an hour later. They must of just changed this procedure seeing as how the last time I ordered Pho from this restaurant it came blazing hot like it should be with the meat thawed out properly. What's even more sad is that they do have decent food. Their customer service on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired. If I'm waiting an hour for my food and paying for it to be delivered I really do expect to not have basically cook it myself."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about this place when my family and I first entered. First of all, it's on the outskirts of the Las Vegas strip and the decor was kind of Westernized. But to my surprise, the food was actually very good. I got a bun (vermicelli) dish and the rest of my family got the pho. Their pho is delicious! :O A lot of places have gone cheap on the broth so it just taste like water, but this place..so good. I'm sad that I didn't get the pho in the first place! It was a bit on the expensive side for their dishes, but you pay for what you get.  Would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Oxtail soup is what you want to try.  Great cooks and great ingredients equal some great Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since day 1. The original lady (forgot her name) always very pleasant(she still works there) but now there's a new lady who is very unprofessional. Basically walked in at 8:17 P.M. and was greeted with a \"Hi, to go?\" I said, \"No, it's for here.\" she told me that if I eat there, that i have to be done by 9oclock. Cause they have to go. I don't live close to this place. So we drove out here for no reason. I worked in Food and Beverage for over a decade. I used to hate when people would come in late. But never would I say what she said to me. It was very unprofessional, and she should have nothing to do with this company. She's bad for business. This occurred 12-23-17.   P.s. This place needs music.   P.s.s. The Pho is great."}
{"text":"Had Pho today and it was awesome.  Never a disappointment. Only reason why I give 4 stars is because of the smell its been having the past two times ive been here. Like a wet mop smell. Makes my appetite shifty but the food is oh so good."}
{"text":"Since I've moved to North Las Vegas, food options are rated based on location and taste.  This is the closet real Vietnamese restaurant that I could find...and it exceeded my expectations.  I was feeling adventurous so I decided to try something different...I always see my parents order the bun bo hue when I am in Seattle, but I've always been afraid because of the congealed pork blood that normally accompanies that dish.  I'm an ABC...so certain things still scare me even though I'm asian..ha.   I noticed they had bun bo hue on the menu BUT without the congealed pork blood and the pork hock was optional.  The lemongrass beef broth was warm, spicy, savory goodness.  The beef, beef tendon, and pork hock with wide rice noodles was the perfect rainy day weather meal.  The broth wasn't quite as spicy as I would like, but the owner came by and dropped off extra spicy sauce.  I think they tame the flavors down due to their clientele and have the optional pork hock as not to scare people.  My fiance tried the chicken vermicelli bowl.  The noodles were cooked well and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  This will be my go to Viet spot if I'm too lazy to drive to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"I ordered their Pho Togo , it is cost $8.75 + Tax =$9.46 ? It's expensive to pay the Food with no value. They give the meat so less compare to order Vietnam restaurant what I pay  before . It is worth to buy the food . Won't come again! Here is the Pho picture which you guy can see what they give u !"}
{"text":"Thought this place was an all right place for some Vietnamese fix. Thought their prices were slightly higher considering, however, it beats having to drive a ways way. So more like a good 3.5 stars. I personally don't prefer this place and would rather make the drive...but the husband doesn't mind his pho. He thinks it isn't so bad. I'm more of a banh mi person which is why I don't prefer this place for it because of price to ratio. We'd normally come in if the husband is feeling pho-ish as we wait for our kids to get out of their faith formation class up the road.   The owners, however, are really nice and welcoming from our experiences. They used to have a business back home.in Hawaii so I'm all about supporting traces of 808. The place is pretty clean. I just couldn't stand the smell of the cigars while eating. I'll smoke a cigar...but just don't prefer the smell of it when I'm having dinner with my younger kids.  Anyway, I'd recommend them as I think they're one of the sure bets around this way. And gosh knows we dont have much pho options around this way. But if you are having a serious pho crave that doesnt want to be ruined...I'd say just make the trip to chinatown. This place isnt anything to shoot across town for. More like a decent spot to get your vietnamese fix (if it's in your proximity) without traveling too far out. You could squeeze a stroller in but I think you should keep it in the trunk if possible.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service. Really enjoyed our lunch. Had Pho and it was great. Good flavor of the broth and meat was tender. Definitely a hide away spot. Not sure if this place gets respect. Move this location to Chinatown and everyone would be talking. Sure is good to have it close by on the west side. For me a little gem. Enjoy the food and not having to drive through traffic to get something this tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"I just picked up a combination Pho with extra tendon and it was horrible and not edible. I was given half a container of very concentrated broth and the quality of the meat was bad....borderline spoiled. I couldn't eat it. $12 wasted."}
{"text":"Don't really enjoy seeing bugs on the lettuce.  Makes me second guess their sanitation in the back of the house.   The thought of it bugs me...  Possibility of returning...maybe not."}
{"text":"Viet Bistro never disappoints! I have been there about 10 times and the food is very reasonably priced, great portions, and delicious! I've had other pho but this place has my favorite. I'm not a pho expert (I've only had it at a few places), but theirs is the best I've had. Never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Service is seriously lacking! Egg rolls were overdone and lettuce was wilty. Pho was average. They are very skimpy on giving more basil and mint when you can flag a server down to ask for some. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right next to my house, and today I really felt like Vietnamese sandwiches. So I thought, why not!  The restaurant is a bit small, but clean. I was greeted right away by a nice young man who gave me a menu for take out. But I didn't need it. I ordered 4 special Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi dac biet) He immediately apologized and said they didn't have the meat needed to make that sandwich. Hmm.. OK.. I thought about leaving, but decided to try something else.   So I ordered their rice dish with pork chop and shredded pork (com tam suong bi cha). He apologized and said they didn't have the pork chops to make that dish.   What! How could you be a functional restaurant and be missing all these key ingredients?? So I thought about walking out again, but the man was genuinely apologetic and nice. So I stayed.  He recommended the spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue). So I ordered 3 orders of that and 1 order of seafood crispy noodle (mi sau don). I did that because I was worried about the freshness of the food here if they were missing so much... I wanted to order something they HAD to make fresh. Not just something they can scoop out of a pot, because who knows when they made that soup??  The nice man gave me an iced tea to sip on while I waited. It was a short wait. I got my food and paid and left.  I admit I stopped by the bank to deposit a check through the ATM, but it was a quick stop. Then I went home.  My husband took the food and started to take everything out. Then he asked, \"did you stop somewhere before coming home? Everything is cold.\" COLD? The ATM was NOT that long.   So we heated it up. And then my husband didn't let me eat anything! I'm 5 months pregnant and we've been very careful with the food I eat so I don't get sick. And all the food looked OLD. The toppings on the crispy noodle looked dried and recooked. The noodles itself didn't taste freshly fried. It was oily like it was sitting in oil 2 days ago.  The noodle soup base was good, but the meat looked dried and old too! It also looked funny!   Ugh how disappointing. I was excited about not having to travel to Chinatown for Vietnamese food. But this place is disgusting. How could they serve food like that? I am not a picky eater so this review could be so much worse if coming from a picky eater!  We are definitely never going back. They need new management. Either that or they think they're serving to people who don't know what Vietnamese food is.  I do have to give credit to the nice man who took my order. He was genuinely nice, genuinely apologetic when things I ordered weren't available. But he needs to leave and find a decent restaurant to work for.  My first one star review :("}
{"text":"This is my third time here and was introduced to this place by some Vietnamese buddies if mine.  Enjoyed the pho, but still think Pho 87 edges then out, nevertheless, above average.  I even got one of my \"white boy\" co-worker hooked on pho here.  He was recovering from throat surgery and needed something easy going.  He always begs me to get pho each time I see him.  #awesomeness.    Moreover, what sets this place apart from other pho joints is that it offers a lot more of a variety in their menu, not too mention they are more of a quality vs. speed eatery.  They appear to put a lot more love into their dishes compared to fast food, \"you eat and go home,\" pho spots.  However, it was kinda disappointing to learn that there their bun bo hue does not include pigs blood.  To most, this is a plus, but I'm that type of dude that appreciates the goods many tend shy away from.  The waiter explained that it's a health code violation to serve it.  Interesting to know.  Especially, since their are tons of \"violators\" out there if this is true.  Nevertheless, the bun bo hue was very tasty and I almost forgot that there was no cubed pigs blood.  It didn't come with the veggies however, but I guess since I was in a rush, I didn't stress it too much.  I also added a combo banh mi to go, but never got to savor it since I gave it to a hungry monster that kept nagging me...she knows who she is.  Caution, one of the waitresses speaks very little english, not to turn you off, but she is very nice."}
{"text":"I don't find the menu easy to skim, but my husband and I really like the food and can't deny they have amazing customer service. They accommodate any and all of our preferences and allergies, offering their own suggestions for substitutes at no additional cost."}
{"text":"This place is ok.    The food was above average. We both had pho and an appetizer of chicken wings.  The wings were a bit small but well prepared.  The pho was HUGE and a good value at 11 bucks.   The server could be more attentive but did the job overall.  She spent most of her time between duties in her cell phone which is sort of annoying.   The dining area was clean but around the edges it could use some attention. There are boxes in the hallway to the bathroom, the front doors could use some attention, the bathrooms could use some updating/attention."}
{"text":"I like their satay pho. Ate there and also to go them plenty of times but no more. Aside from the smell of the tobacco from next door,  the service is slow and has poor customer services.  Have to ask for spoons and for refills of water. Their regular pho was water down, bland and no favor whatsoever.  Their rice dish was dry and is not favorful. Their bun bo hue is nothing like the real bun bo (i guess it something & better than nothing). I only come pho satay cause it's different and unique. i called in to place a to go,  they forgot basil leaves and my satay (i always order pho satay, how can u eat it without satay on the side).  So i started to check my orders the next time when placed a to go. Happened again, asked the lady and she went in the back,   cameo out to handed me a half of an oz of satay for three large pho satay. I then asked for more satay, and she gave an oz container of satay...came home w half cooked rice noodle (banh pho). Ppl to go food home cause we don't want to cook, so i have to boil a pot of hot water to dip in all the rice noodles again.  I want to say i like this place still but the quality and how the customer services is now,  i will rather go eat Thai food or drive myself to pho Saigon 8, better pho and services aren't sloppy. I'm not being unreasonable,  this happens one too many times.  I used to worked at a pho place and this i see is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The pho is good and well portioned. It would have been a 5 star if they had good customer service. We only seen one guy when we went and he wasn't cheerful or didn't even smile. Just told us to sit where ever, took our order and just silent."}
{"text":"Stopped by here again since 01/2015, the place still smelled like smoke. Yikes!!! The customer service was bad. I wanted something quick and light. I asked for a dessert menu, and the Vietnamese clerk wasn't very pleasant knowing I wasn't going to spend a lot of money there. The dessert I wanted was the \"3-Color\" dessert which she said she didn't have it. Oh, well! I won't step my foot in again."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. But, the food wasn't that good. The bowl was smaller than it looked in the picture and the food wasn't very flavorful. After many tries I haven't found a good decent place for Vietnamese cuisines around town except for on Spring Mountain road. I guess I will go China Town area from now on for some good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"They have no competition in this area so maybe that's why they can cut corners. To get more authentic Vietnamese, have to make the haul to Chinatown. Disappointing pho and broken rice dishes. I would compare this place to an average Chinese restaurant, and that's not good."}
{"text":"Best Pho broth in town! It's much better for group dining than the other location on Lake Mead. The owner makes the BEST hot sauce! If you don't see a metal container on your table, make sure you ask for the homemade hot sauce."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite pho place.. Ever. There's something in their broth that make it so good and NOT taste like water unlike the other pho places in Chinatown. The serving is pretty much the same but the prices are probably $1 more than the other places around town, BUT it's worth it since it is much better tasting and much better quality food than the ones in Chinatown.   I've never actually sat here and dined because I always ordered takeout instead, but the owner and his employees are super generous and they make you feel welcome right when you come into the store. They basically welcome you with a smile! Again, unlike the other pho places I've been to. In this restaurant, they're here to make sure you're a happy customer.   Big plus: I don't have to drive aaaaalllllllll the way to Chinatown just to eat some alright tasting pho, but instead I can take a five minute drive to Viet Bistro!   Only downside to this place is that there's a cigar place next door and you can really smell the stench of the cigars once you enter the restaurant :(  Other than that, great food, amazing service. You MUST drop in here and try Viet Bistro out!"}
{"text":"Service and food on original location is so much better. I was very disappointed as this was closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I'm a Vietnamese food lover with pho being my favorite dish. I ordered the P3 pho and it was amazing. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Vietnamese food. A++"}
{"text":"Tucked in the middle of a strip mall on Lake Meade and Rock Springs.. you'd never know it was here. Tasty food that comes quickly and with a smile.  Don't  let the dim lighting fool you. The food is tasty and generous. We had summer rolls, phone,  and my favorite  rice noodle salad. Try it... you'll  like it!"}
{"text":"The pho wasn't bad but don't get the nem noung or the goi coung awful the only good thing was the hot tea"}
{"text":"Nice pho and noodle selections, good French Vietnamese sandwiches, spring rolls, house specials and tofu dishes.  I like the tofu w/veggies over fried noodles and the rice noodle crepe.  Vietnamese coffee is well done.  Service is friendly but need a translator.  Ambience is getting better but it's still in a cupboard in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find Viet Bistro and enjoy a great bowl of Pho in my neighborhood. The strip mall location is busy and parking is tight during meal time. The restaurant is modest but the food packs a punch with YUMMY. I enjoyed my first lunch experience so much trying the Special Combination Pho and Thai Iced Tea that I have to return shortly thereafter for a piping hot bowl of Oxtail Pho.  The broth tasted so flavorful and the smell was so rich in fragrant.  The delicacy of the fresh Thai basil, lemon, bean sprouts and slices of jalapenos peppers added to the  Pho danced my mouth. The slow cooking meat was very tender and for an extra $2.75 you can add a great assortment of vegetables (not cabbage). The service is fast but count on the server speaking English. I tried the Ginger Iced Tea lemonade with Mint and it was crazy good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Service and food are great depsite the smokey cigar smell. Filet Pho is delicious. Service could be better. Waiters sometimes don't understand you."}
{"text":"The Thai tea was on point. Got the Filet mignon pho. So good. I usually go the the one up on lake mead but the gf lives down near this one. This store is a step up from the one on lake mead. No Smokey smell and everything was good."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a decent Pho place by our side of town instead of having to drive alllllll the way to Chinatown.  So....we finally found this place! Food was good-can't complain. The service and atmosphere was good. The Bon Bo Hue here is the best I had in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"I would give them zero stars if I could. It's a very dirty place. Food splattered on the walls and not removed and food on my water glass. Food was not great but I could not get over how dirty the place was to even enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"SCORES Dim sum: 4 Pho: 2 Staff: 1  Eaten here multiple times. Dim sum is better than anything else in Madison. Service ruins it.  You order off of a dim sum menu or off of the carts. There are enough UW students that it can get pretty packed on weekends, so go early or go on the weekdays if you don't want to be kept waiting.   Staff is dysfunctional to put it politely, so when it gets busy, service essentially halts. Basically they need to ditch the gimmick of a cart and let people order off the dim sum menu. It would make service less hectic and allow people to get their food sooner.  1st time - came here alone for the dim sum, like the 2nd day they started serving. Was delicious, staff was attentive, but mostly because the place was 25% filled. 5/5  2nd time - came w/ a big group of 8. We kept asking for one particular dish (fried dumplings) and must have gotten 4-5 servers, the dim sum cart guy like 2-3 times, and still didn't get the dish. Pretty sure the cooking staff kept making it and it would get grabbed by other tables before it got to me. Pretty much pissed me off that we had to ask for water, tea, specific dishes, and our check MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE times - being packed doesn't excuse atrocious service. 3/5  3rd time - came for pho. Broth tasted flat like if it came from a dry powder mix. Pho didn't have a lot of meat for the XL bowl. Won't usurp Saigon Noodle, in my opinion. Also the fire alarm went off for like 25 minutes because a vent fan wasn't working, but I got like $2 off in exchange for the aural assault. 1/5  4th time - came for banh mi, they said their chef wasn't there so there wasn't Vietnamese food. Doesn't matter, had dim sum. 4/5  5th time - came for dim sum, Saturday brunch. Friends beat me there and said they were closed for dim sum. Cooking staff drama part 2? We left. 1/5  I really want to like you, Viet Bistro, but your service is so inconsistent. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the phu flank steak, tripe. The flavor of the broth was great. It's a smaller restaurant but the food is great. I would recommend coming here instead of driving all the way to Chinatown"}
{"text":"In the mood for pho this evening after hosting a huge home-cooked prime rib meal, we headed down to the closest pho place around my house.  Well, not sure if this was THE closest, but suffice to say that there isn't one that close to my house so found the next best thing.  I think pho in Vegas is generally good, so my main objective is to find somewhere that is clean.  Kihn Do, Pho Sing Sing, and this place all offer the cleanliness and good pho, so all are equally recommended.  New Saigon in John's Creek, GA still offers the best pho, not necessarily from taste standpoint (they're all good) but more from the ingredients.  They give you a lot of everything, very fresh, and extra sides of cilantro and onions.  I have yet to find that anywhere in Vegas, so while the taste is comparable from soup & noodle standpoint, they just can't compare to what New Saigon offers in the \"extras\".  Still, it's good food, staff are friendly, and price is reasonable so it all amounts to a good 4-star rating.  The convenience for me will favor this place over the others.   Table-for-1 Factor:  Any Asian noodle shops should be just fine for eating alone (except those in the casinos, I guess), and this place is no exception."}
{"text":"My regular pho spot. Closest to home, consistently good broth, good service, great prices."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but service is slow. Shaking beef is incredible. Chicken bowl was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It's always my favorite place to get pho. And everything else is great the owners always remember my order and make the experience great."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go. I only ate here once, but everyone in our group enjoyed their meals just fine. And that's saying something seeing as two of the people in our party were full out Vietnamese.   They gave the pho a thumbs up.   I gave my teriyaki chicken a thumbs up. (I know, I really branched out in my entrée choice.)  Only thumbs down is that they're now closed."}
{"text":"This was the last meal on my most recent Vegas bender and boy did it hit the spot. This place is a small Vietnamese joint in a strip mall next to what I hear are also restaurants worth checking out. I enjoyed their vermicelli noodle bowl with the shrimp, steak, and egg rolls combo on top. The giant bowl of goodness was less than $10 and filled me up despite being on the light side. Their special sauce is a must try if you are in the area. Add some Sriracha to your bowl and you have a perfect meal.   Service was super friendly and quick, I'm glad I found this spot!"}
{"text":"Went here about a week ago for some Pho. Nice place with about 15 tables. Service was very good. I enjoyed the Pho plenty of meat and delicious flavor. I think you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Good quality fresh food at very good prices. I had the Grilled chicken bowl or bun as it's called in Vietnamese. Tasty dish with the house dressing."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant after a seminar at crossfit modulus this past Saturday and it the place smelled like  cigarette smoke and a garbage can. I was really craving pho so I thought well maybe it won't be so bad. So I went and sat down. I had to use the bathroom so I went into the bathroom and there was literally poop stains on the wall. I had enough. I walked out. The food may be delicious but who knows what crawled into it!!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and needed a Banh Mi sandwich pretty bad and I didn't want to drive all the way to Spring Mountain so I went here. It was one of the poorer banh mi's I've had.   The reason I like banh mi's is the awesome flavor from the cilantro as well as the goodness from a bunch of the other veggies. This poor sandwich only got 2 sprigs of cilantro and a few chunks of carrot, etc. almost as an afterthought.   The bread was good so can't complain there. Chicken was kind of barbeque-y - haven't had it quite like that before. But could have used some more filling overall and definitely a ton more cilantro!"}
{"text":"Had to leave after seeing the bathrooms.   First, sat down and gave my orders. Like the other people said, English is a challenge, but being a foreigner myself, I try to be more tolerant. But if you've been here for years and are somewhat young, learn the language.   Got my appetizer: fresh shrimp spring rolls, like other said, with iceberg lettuce. Ok. Go to wash my hands, and the women's bathroom is disgusting. I mean, my shoes are sticking to the floor. No soap. Go to men's bathroom looking for soap (the restaurant is almost empty, and I needed to wash my hands), even dirtier and mo soap.  Go to serving station where there is a sink for employees and then wash my hands.   After all this, I had to cancel my pho, paid for my quarter eaten spring rolls, and took off to a brand new Asian fusion restaurant recently opened in the same business plaza.   Being pregnant, I can't afford to get sick. And I'm the one who goes to East Vegas to eat a tongue torta at a Hispanic supermarket, so don't call me picky. But clean is clean in ANY language/culture."}
{"text":"Meh. This place wasn't great but wasn't bad.  We order the lamb spring rolls, pho with rare steak and bo bun hue.    Lamb spring rolls sounded interesting but I didn't really care for them.  I didn't finish the broth on either the pho nor the bo bun hue, nor have the urge to take it home.   I wish I had listened to fellow yelpers about the smell of the cigar shop that somehow seeps into this restaurant.  Weird smells don't normally detract from my restaurant experiences but this definitely did."}
{"text":"In my general area there are two Vietnamese restaurants in lake mead and the I 95. Comparing Pho Rose and Viet Bistro and I still go to Viet Bistro.   Pho rose pho serms to have fishy taste to it and not sure why.  Viet Bistro just tastes right. If you are in the area give Viet Bistro a shot.  I can name other pho places that I think deserves the 5 stars but not mentioning it here.  I am satisfied for the pho here and the location is convenient for me."}
{"text":"This place is good.   My absolute fave: the stuffed calamari salad!!  I love vermicelli noodle bowls however I don't recommend that dish here because most of the meat was pure fat."}
{"text":"not open till 10pm on saturday...  although yelp has it open till 10, i just went there at nine pm and it was very closed. thanks yelp!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I was disappointed with the atmosphere. It's located right next to a smoke shop. There was such a strong smoke smell in Viet bistro which made it less appetizing. The food was okay. I cannot go back because of the cigar smell."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!    When I saw a new Pho restaurant opening in our neck of the woods, I was ecstatic. We came for dinner on opening day, and the staff was the friendliest and attentive bunch...it was their grand opening after all.   The menu has so many items that you don't see at a typical Vietnamese restaurant, and that alone will have me coming back.  But, we were there to try our usuals: Dac Biet, Bun, and Imperial Rolls.    (Shredded pork spring rolls and Soda Chanh are usually included on our list of regulars, but sadly- they didn't offer it on their menu.)    The Dac Biet (Combination Pho) was average in my opinion.  My gold standard is the broth at Golden Deli in San Gabriel, CA.  It was good, but something was missing.  And looking back, I don't recall it having any tendon pieces, and the cilantro was minimal.  The meat serving was also not as plentiful one would expect for $8.50/ bowl.   The Bun (Rice noodles with grilled shrimp and sliced pork) on the other hand, is a dish I will return for.  The veggies were fresh and plentiful, and the special sauce was delicious. Definitely worth the $8.50.   The Imperial Rolls were also good, but again not the best I have ever tried. Since they didn't offer Soda Chanh, I ordered a Ginger Iced Tea Lemonade instead.  Unlike the previous reviewer, the ginger flavor was definitely overpowering and the drink was really sweet.    Nonetheless, the rest of the menu is VERY intriguing- I will definitely be back to try one of those!! And you can bet, I'll back before the 20% off promotion ends on May 31st."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a nice healthy homemade bowl of chicken pho.  In summerlin i dont think there are many great family owned restaurants.  This is one of the few places i really enjoy coming too."}
