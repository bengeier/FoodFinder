{"text":"Not your average deli. I have eaten here for over 15 years and can vouch that this place is cut above. Sandwiches are large, fresh and delicious. Particularly good are the breaded chicken sandwiches. There are always fresh specials every day and these are hit and miss but still better than anything you could get at a Druxy's or similar chain. Also the smoked meat is hot and sliced to order."}
{"text":"This deli on the ground floor of 2630 Skymark is a great lunch spot for salads and sandwiches. They have a few daily specials and will custom make any sandwich. On my first visit I had the breaded chicken sandwich and unfortunately, it was very dry on a very white bun. My friends had the Skymark club and caesar salads and it looked better than my chicken sandwich.  On future visits I would stick with the daily specials or the soups, salads and sandwiches. The staff seem very friendly and the line moves quickly. The interior is clean and spacious and great for larger groups.  I understand from my guests that Skymark also has some good breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"Nice Indy deli - good size breakfasts and bagels etc. Choice of house coffee as well as Starbucks. Owner and the staff are usually cheerful and helpful."}
