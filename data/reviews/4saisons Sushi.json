{"text":"This place is great for delivery sushi in HoMa through JustEat. I have unsuccessfully tried over 5 different sushi delivery restaurants in my neighbourhood before finding these guys. They're now officially our go-to! The rolls are always large, very fresh and delicious, with a generous amount of fish in them. My favourites are the salmon and tuna maki tartare rolls and rainbow roll - so good! They also include a bonus roll if you spend over $22. I took off one star because the delivery is quite long, never under an hour and fifteen/hour and a half."}
{"text":"Bon resto, les produits sont frais et bon. Le prix est correct. Bon acceuil, on reviendra."}
{"text":"I can't tell you a thing about the food, because we ordered for delivery and well, we called back after and hour and they lied telling us that it went out. After 2 and a quarter hours, we called back to cancel. We lived 1km away, it's a 10 minute walk! Well, apparently calling and cancelling wasn't enough. After more than four hours they ring the doorbell. We have to crawl out of bed in our PJs to answer the door... we've gone to bed! And who's there, but the delivery guy. Seriously? You think we are interested in food that we ordered for dinner four hours ago? You order at 7 and you think you can deliver it at 11 PM? And the phone attitude says it all... they just aren't listening! You would think that after an hour and a half that you should pick up the phone and apologize and see if they still want the order? After two hours? After two and a half hours? After three hours? After three and a half hours? After four?"}
{"text":"I've ordered in sushi from 4 Saisons almost 20 times and haven't been disappointed. Fresh sushi delivered to my door with my favourite part... an extra cadeaux for spending over $20.

Great quality and variety. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian sushi choice! Had we not had to wait 1.5 hours for our delivery order we would have given the restaurant 4 stars as the sushi was quite delicious! But this kind of wait is too much."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that this place only has one review, and that it's a scathing delivery time and miscommunication related one at that.

I have ordered delivery from here 6 times, I wanted to give it a few times before I wrote this.

I've been trying random other sushi places from JustEat.ca, trying to find the \"best\" in my area in regards to price, food quality and quantity, and this has come out on top.

It's good. Quality sushi, large enough portions and it's not arm-and-a-leg expensive like most mediocre sushi in Montreal. 

They also give you a free \"chef's choice\" roll which is usually a fried salmon futo-maki for ordering over $22 which is usually around what we spend. 

Always fast and on time, and the delivery drivers are polite as well."}
{"text":"Recently decided to order delivery from this place through Just Eat. They usually offer a 20% discount on all orders, so we figured why not. The menu seemed promising, with a long list of specialties at very reasonable prices. Their seafood selection was pretty small, so don't expect to find yellowtail tuna, seabass or uni here. Some of the reviews mentioned a free roll for orders over $20, but we didn't get any, which is fine because the sushi didn't turn out to be great. The rolls lacked flavor and had very little fish. Just overall a very blah experience that I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Je suis une habitu√©e, leurs sushis sont beaux, bons, pas chers. Et les proprios super gentils !"}
{"text":"My hairstylist suggested that we order from this place for fast food style sushi. She said you get good sushi for very cheap. I will NEVER order from here anymore! 

We ordered for a take out. I asked how long it would take and what was my bill. They said 15 min. and a total of 29,55$. We got there and the food was ready but the guy wanted to charge us 38$. Luckily I remembered my order and processed on reviewing it with him. It was his \"error\". So be careful with them about your bill. So...we got a won ton. Not that good. A deep sea maki roll. We were looking for the eel. Finally a 20 pieces chef's choice. There was A (1) piece that seemed to be from a previous roll. Perhaps leftover? I think so. Then two pieces of something else. All that to say that it seems that we got the leftovers. It didn't taste fresh at all! So disappointed! Because the order was over 22$, we got a free spider roll. Saggy and lack of flavours. The rice was also way overcooked and they somehow added too much water to it. I know not to expect too much from places like this...but come on!!! We ended up throwing out most of the sushis. Most of leftover sushis! No wonder the place is empty."}
