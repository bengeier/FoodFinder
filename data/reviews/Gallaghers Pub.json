{"text":"I was seriously debating to write about this restaurant!! It's in a weird area. It is full of trade people, truck drivers, plumbers, construction workers etc...  Some of my male friends have been raving reviews that they have delicious, fresh, home cooked style ( comfort food )for under $15.00!!  The suggestion from the waitress was lasagna, some of us had lasagna, some took  the  the spaghetti and we ordered the chicken Parmesan.... just because!!
For lunch garlic bread was included with the the Lasagna and with the spaghetti. I had a side of house salad house dressing ( delicious and fresh ).
A lunch special with a pop or a beer for one person, less than 15.00, unheard of!   It was super fresh, really delicious. Server was friendly   neutral..and efficient.
It's not a date place. And I don't see two women going to eat there. It has a feel of an old fashioned tavern, where 20 years ago woman would not have been allowed in. 
 The people that go there daily probably come from the, 'kind of' industrial section near it.  Before leaving I wanted to check out the ladies room,        ( washroom ),    It was clean, really, really clean. (two really's) rare to find a bathroom that  clean!     I don't know that your looking for a lunch place that is delicious under 15.00 but if you need to eat, are hungry and are near there is a great place for men to go.  If you are ever broke, and want great home made, fresh, delicious food... go to Gallaghers!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza, nice place, good service. Went on a sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"They have the best wings in town and customer service is awesome. The place is very clean and atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Good size chicken wings, good wine and friendly service. However the place is outdated, not the best ambience an the chicken wins were over well done, make it difficult to taste. Sorry but we will probably not going back there. Better choose another pub, unless you do not care about the ambience."}
{"text":"Wow, another awesome find just driving around looking for something to eat. Local neighborhood type bar. Amazing, they have 19 cent chicken wings everyday which are as good as any I've had anywhere, including the original Buffalo chicken wings.  Minimum of 10 on order but are you kidding me, 19 cents a piece? You couldn't eat $4 worth come on. 
Wasn't the most pleasant welcome when I first arrived but that changed after a while. I get it, I'm the outsider which I could feel at first. Never a nervous moment just one of those things. I no longer drink beer so red wine is for me now, their Cab was pretty damn good for $6 bucks. This is one of the things I love about traveling, trying out new places. This is a must if your in the area. Low frills great food and drinks. If I lived here I could see myself hanging out here.
Zack the bartender is very attentive to your meal, drinks and that you are completely satisfied. Im totally stoked about finding this place."}
{"text":"I ordered from here on skip the dishes, got my food and most of it was okay until I noticed there was a plastic lid floating in my soup. Maybe for texture? No matter what not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"A neighborhood pub for locals.  Essentially a dive bar with good food.  Abrupt older server.  TV screens, slot machines and a pool table.  Clubhouse sandwich was good but they unfortunately put processed cheese slices instead of cheddar.  (They really need to change that).  Salads are good.  The pulled pork burger was good.  Steak sandwich was good but ask for a little less cooked than what you normally like.  Wings are good and come with veggies. We didn't try the pizza.  For a dive bar it's a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"This is a dive, filthy and smelly.  The chance of food poisoning is higher than normal from the filth I saw, all they need to do is clean- the place and the people, not so hard you would think.  Stay away until it's clean, then take your chances."}
{"text":"Sorry the owner was very nice but called the day before and the girl said of course we could take our left overs home. Will not go back again, because you can't on a special"}
{"text":"One of the only places with cheap wings on Friday. Good service, drinks were tasty and food was good."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!!!  Great daily lunch specials for $7!  I get the personal pan pizza.  Delish!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food here, but were led to believe drinks  were on happy hour, when in fact only certain drinks were included.  So we were charged full price for 14  oz beer that was listed as 20  ozs on the menu.

Good way to lose 1st time customers."}
{"text":"Great quality, tasty food at amazing prices.  I recommend the pizza, steak sandwich, beef dip, salad, chicken wings and more.  I'm not a fan of the fries, but that's personal taste."}
{"text":"I go here quite frequently. The new owners are real friendly. Its got quite the menu with moderate prices. Wings are always a special. They have a pool table and it is a good place to hangout.

They are always upgrading and have half off pizza Sunday's with complimentary pool games."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience here, although I don't know that it was because of the service or the food, but instead my fellow patrons.

While getting my oil changed behind this strip mall, I walked over looking to grab a bite while I waited. I was a little apprehensive about going in alone, but I was having a rough day and really needed a drink. There were only about 2 or 3 occupied tables in the place so I settled into one in the corner. The server/bartender was super sweet, offering me a bunch of trashy magazines to read while I ate (bonus!) and filling my wine glass allll the way up. I ordered some chicken fingers & fries, which came out piping hot and fresh. The fries reminded me a lot of New York Fries, which surprised me because I didn't expect much from this place. I enjoyed my meal, read my magazines, and drank my wine - I was a happy girl!

I'm minding my own business, reading my magazines and eating, when I notice out of the corner of my eye that an older gentleman has stood up to talk to the server at the bar, and then left. I paid no attention to it until she came up to me and told me that he had paid my bill for me. I was legitimately shocked! He told her not to tell me until he left. He wasn't creepy, just a kind stranger who did a nice thing for another stranger. It was such a nice thing to do for absolutely no reason at all. I tipped the server quite a bit because she treated me well, and she was SO appreciative that by the time I left, my day had done a total 180. I didn't get a chance to thank him, so if you are reading this kind stranger, THANK YOU! You made my day 100 times better and I am waiting for the right opportunity to pay that good deed forward.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a no frills neighborhood pub that definitely caters to the blue collar and low key crowd.  I love that I know where I can go for a beer and not have to care what I look like.  If you want to wear a ball cap and jogging pants or show up after a long day of working in a mud pit, you're good to go.  It's fabulous and folks who come from smaller communities, like me, will appreciate this.  

Gallaghers has had some upgrades and the bar is actually quite nice.  The ladies room has some new tiles and foamy soap but really needs help otherwise.  There's one pool table and sports to watch.  For those who care, they have karaoke but I'd call to confirm when it is as their website also needs some help.

My spouse and I showed up on a Friday before 6pm and the place was packed.  There were only two small tables available.  We are by no means the upper crust of society but we stood out a bit.  I was in jeans and a sweater but my hair was done up and I had sparkly earrings on.  I actually felt overdressed.  

I really respect people who work hard and those servers were bustling around like I've not seen in a very long time.  It made me happy inside and the service was great.  Friday is burger night so I tried the Western.  It had a thick home-made (I'm assuming) patty with onion rings, BBQ sauce and some other house made burger sauce as well.  Awesome and under $9 with your side of choice.  The fries were not overly salty.  My spouse was in the mood for a steak sandwich but the best he could do here was the Sirloin.  He said it was just okay but had ordered the mushrooms and Caesar salad with it, which were good.

I get the sense that if you returned a few times and sat at the bar, you'd likely make some friends here.

{"text":"I go here quite often with my buddy...cheap tasty wings...But the service is always iffy. Last night we went and it took a good 10 minutes before we were even noticed...it took 1 hr for our food to arrive...we were the last people in there eating as everyone already had their food and drink when we arrived...How hard is it to cook wings and make a salad. The one waitress was more interested in chatting with people at the bar than actually making rounds...and often she would walk right over to the table next to us...remove dishes and walk away without asking us if we were ready to order. I will not be going there again...I can put up with mediocre food but when the staff is useless and never apologizes for taking so long and are more concerned about socializing with the guys....it's time to go elsewhere. Calgary has HUNDREDS of pubs.
Dear owners....perhaps your presence is needed so these girls don't ruin your business!"}
