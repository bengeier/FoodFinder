{"text":"Caveat emptor, this place is perfectly adequate by Ohio Chinese buffet standards, but not for people who consider themselves afficionados of Asian cuisine.  The place is clean and they have a pretty large selection of buffet options.  As you can read from some other reviews on here, it ranges from mongolian beef and hot & sour soup to pizza and a ham carving station.  The staff is all Asian, and one can't be sure if they actually speak any English, or if they have just learned some key words and phrases to do what they need to do for their Midwestern clientele.  It's very hard to tell the difference between some of the dishes, like the sticky sweet Sesame Chicken vs the similarly sticky and sweet General's Chicken.  Like every other Chinese buffet in Ohio, they feature a dessert section too with odd little petit fours and banana chunks drizzled with some mysterious red sweet syrup.  If you decide to eat here, go hungry and adjust your expectations to something less authentic than Panda Express.  You may love it, or you may be like me and think \"eh, it's a lot of food for not that much money.\""}
{"text":"If you dare to eat here do it I assume before 7pm. We got there a little before 9pm on a Tuesday evening (they are opened until 10pm).  The smell of the place should have been my first clue as to what I was in for. Moth balls and old musty water damaged wood comes to mind.  The food,  what there was of it... (1/2-3/4 of the hot food pans were empty) was dried up and stuck to the pans. And a fly seemed to enjoy the withering sushi (I only hope my husband and son survive consuming it). You may say well that's what we get for going so late.. but we were not alone... 3-4 other tables were sat after us!! (How they could seat people in good conscience is beyond me) If they are going to stay open until 10.... serve GOOD FRESH food until as close to 10 as possible!  Chinese buffets are some of our favorite places to eat...usually 2-3 times a month.  We've had them all over and this was by far the worst!  And never was one drink refill offered! There are ways to put out good quality food until closing without wasting food... smaller amounts at a time.  Especially when you have customers still coming in. We will never be back and I'm sure the owners could care less.... they got my 30 bucks. My advice... goggle another restaurant.... you couldn't possibly do worse."}
{"text":"Located on the West Side at 3366 Warren Rd, this buffet is eerily similar to my favorite China Buffet on the East Side in Mayfield. It is your typical China Buffet fare; most importantly at these restaurants, the food is fresh and not left out too long. I'd say this is the West Side version of my favorite Chinese buffet.  The best part is the decor. They have a huge blue domed ceiling painted and lighted like the sky! I've got some pictures of it on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/05/oriental-palace-buffet.html)"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Very very rude! It's messy and unsanitary.  It's worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. They don't even deserve a star. From 1 to 10 they are a -3!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times.  When it first opened it was great.  The last time we ate here, in mid spring of this year, I looked at the buffet and said a quick prayer that I would survive.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Never had I seen such horrendous treatment from restaurant employees both as a patron and a former restaurant worker myself. I met a friend here twice in 2 weeks time, and the first time was for dinner. Everything went well, except for one instance when I paid the server a compliment, and she just looked at me and said nothing in return. I chalked it up to a possible language barrier, but there is no excuse for the condition of the restroom.   I met the same friend here a second time here for a late lunch. This time, the server did not give any sort of verbal response or acknowledgment when my friend asked for a refill of his beverage. Then, the check was brought to the table, and a little while later we were told we had to pay and leave. As if that was not rude enough, the cashier then made it quite clear that she did not like how much time we spent dining at this facility because she was clearly keeping a close eye in us for some reason. She was extremely rude and argumentative, and to top it all off, she made it a point to run to the door after my friend walked out and told him to \"go f... himself\". I then called and asked to speak to the owner, and the same cashier answered who also claimed to be the owner. She made no apologies, and we find out that she lied about being the owner.   Do not dine at this establishment, and tell everyone you know to not dine here as well. With treatment like this, they do not deserve to stay in business."}
{"text":"As Ushers \"yeah\" was playing over the speakers, 3 buddy's and myself enjoyed a delicious meal on a Sunday afternoon. The food was fresh and continually attended to. Highly recommend their chicken on a stick.   While Usher was playing, the power went out. People stayed calm and continued eating only to be turned back on within 3 minutes and Usher back to keep everyone in a good mood. All I could have used were some strobe lights and a beer."}
{"text":"I love Oriental Palace Buffet!  First off, I just have to note that half the fun is reading the labels on the food along the buffet.  One day, I may have to submit some of them to Engrish.com: \"STRAWBERRY JELLOY,\" the jello reads, and \"ORANG\" to describe the fruit below.  The labels go on and on, and it's a sweet, if not baffling, touch.  That being said, I don't mean to laugh at the owner and staff's expense, because they're all very nice there.  When I get the buffet take-out (they charge by the pound), they've given me breaks on prices if I've come close to closing time.  The food is alright, and because of the range of choices you can probably find something you like and won't feel too guilty if you don't want to finish eating certain things.  The peanut chicken is my favorite, and I find it addictive.  They offer several vegetable-heavy dishes, as well as seafood and some unexpected, random things (like pizza).  I tend to stay away from the sushi and the desserts; neither appeal to me.  The facility is spacious and clean, and the staff is very attentive, clearing plates and silverware often in-between helpings.  There's a large private party room off to the side of the buffet that's a nice area to dine when people crowd the booth area."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Food is served in Buffett style .  It is a great place to go if you have the inkling for Chinese"}
{"text":"It's a dump inside and the food is below average. It's only 7.99 for dinner, but I left feeling ashamed that I didn't spend more for something good."}
{"text":"Came here for my son's 8th birthday dinner (  per his request ) this place has gone way down hill.  Ripped seats through out all repaired with grey duct tape.  Greasy, nasty, slippery floors from the front of the house to the back.  Only half of the food selections from the past visits.  I literally lost my appetite while looking around.  On the up side the staff was friendly as usual but with that said NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"I was completely disappointing when I came for their dinner buffet.  I guess I can't expect much for the price but from the service to the food I will NEVER go back again. I went on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm. The food had minimal appeal and majority of the pans were empty. The sushi area contained 3 pieces of sushi if that. The ice c ream station was dirty and the ice cream seemed old and freezer burned. The server came to my table once and never to be seen again! yep no more Oriental Palace for me!"}
{"text":"Nothing super special, but it is clean and the food is fresh and tasty which is all we can ask for in a buffet."}
{"text":"A decent Chinese Buffet, I go here primarily because of location.  However, the staff is always pleasant, despite limited English, and the place is always kept clean.  There's a decent selection of chinese dishes, as well as pizza, roast beef, clams, crab legs, salads, fruits and desserts and ice cream.  This place won't stand out in your memory above other buffets, except for perhaps the cleanliness and the neat ceiling above the buffet - painted and lighted to look like clouds in the sky."}
{"text":"The best food bargain in Cleveland!  The $4.99 lunch buffet Monday thru Saturday is a gustatory treasure.  I've found the roast beef occasionally wonderful, but sometimes merely good.  AYCE boiled shrimp are certainly a good deal, but remember to pick up a wedge or two of lemon if you use it.  I love the crunchiness of the Sesame Chicken, perhaps caused by overcooking, and they pack more filling in the Crab Rangoon than any place I know of.  Six flavors of ice cream are daily goodies (ask my wife, who insists on coffee flavor and peach), but stay away from the dried-out mini-eclairs and such.  Not the best Asian food; just the best for the money!"}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet with as big group of friends. It was good for the price. The sushi was good. So was the chicken and broccoli, green beans, crab rangoon and teriyaki chicken sticks. I wasn't a fan of the wonton soup but then I'm a snob when it comes to that. The American type dishes weren't a thrill either. Also they could have labeled things better. The staff was great. The size of the buffet was good. I did miss getting a fortune cookie. I'll still go back since the price is good. $5.95 plus a buck for drink then tip is ok. Oh one thing I did find a small bug on one of the plates that the tongs for the sushi rested on. I gave the plate to the lady working on the buffet and put a new plate for new tongs."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of explosive diarrhea and really rude staff this is the place for you."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a meal on a budget I'd recommend here. The decor isn't the best and it's obvious that the place hasn't been kept up with but we've never had an issue with our food. Everything always has been good the couple times we've been here. Only one instance we had to wait an exceptionally long time for a drink refill. Probably my only complaint.  Remember you are paying $4.99 for a lunch buffet. This isn't going to be gourmet food with top of the line decorations."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and am confused as to why the majority of them are good. I travel quite a bit for work and have eaten at many Chinese buffets. This place was one of the worst I've eaten at. Not a large selection and every piece of meat I ate was extremely soggy and lacked flavor. I was hesitant to try the sushi, but did anyways. It was stale and fell apart before I even had the opportunity to raise it to my mouth. Lesson learned to never go here again."}
{"text":"Nightmare at the Oriental Palace Barffet.  Called ahead to ensure they had pizza & fries for my 4 yr old kid otherwise we'd gone elsewhere. There by 6:30 (prime dinnertime).  1. Decor / condition was horrifyling dungeonous. Neon green duct tape ALL over my booth seat.  Counted 34! lights out in the ceiling. Not a single picture on walls.  2. Of course.. No Pizza, No Fries on buffet!   3. Food was already mushy.. all 10 dishes I tried. Plus No spring rolls! Really?! 4. Don't ever go into their restroom, nuf said!  So my kid ate a bowl of peaches and tried the \"Ice cream\" After gagging on the freezer burned cream we went to pay / complain.  Manager didn't even apologize or say anything about lying to us on phone about pizza/fries. My wife politely asked to remove kids meal, Manager left to go bicker w/ the 2 \"servers\" then returned to fight about the bill and how much my daughter ate!! After much debating, she flashed the peace sign & proclaimed \"2 dollars for kid!\" We laughed and said here's $17.26 for 2 adults. She argued about our tax calculation, so guess they suck at math & making food!! So take this as a lesson and save yourself from a terrible dining experience and go to China Wall at Great Northern. There are too many respectable Asian eateries to settle for the Nightmare at the Oriental Palass!"}
{"text":"I can't even give negative stars, the are only getting a star for pity and for the fact that I only wasted $5 for a meal.   First of all, the inside is dark and dreary, probably to keep people from seeing all the bugs that are crawling around. Typical Chinese buffet, but on a scale of 1-10 it's a -3.   Their selection is bare minimum, and the fish I wouldn't trust if you paid me.   The food was cold, and old; and I'm not even sure that the general tso's I ate was chicken! The teriyaki stick chicken was all fat I couldn't even chew it. The rice was hard, no flavoring, the lo neon was doused with grease. Broccoli was undercooked. I had one plate and I was fed up and left.   I really don't understand how they are in business, nor do I understand how they have a 3 star rating! Chinese food is one of my specialties, and this ruined it for me for a while. Not to mention the awful stomach ache I got afterwards...  BEWARE"}
{"text":"they sing happy birthday to me and my friends every time!!! I always think their food is the best idea until I'm finished. But I think that has more to do with my inability to eat in moderation. But that's personal."}
{"text":"for a buffet this is the best value and quality I have ever seen. All of the servers were pleasant the food was hot and mostly fresh and the price was awesome! $4.99 for lunch and $7.99 for dinner definately would patronize this establishment again"}
{"text":"I've only ate lunch here and the price is amazing. Super cheap. Food is good for price but don't expect much. Drinks are slow to get filled up. Always makes my stomach upset! Damn it!!!"}
{"text":"I succumbed to a primal urge to binge recently, and found myself at the Oriental Palace Buffet.  I was once a regular at these types of places (and I was once 40 pounds heavier than I am today).  That said, The Palace is really good food.  The dining room is showing a bit of wear and tear, but as others have commented, the food is fresh, and does not sit on the line for too long.  The staff were actively keeping the place clean and tidy while I was there, and they left me to my business.  What was my business?  Three plates full of delicious Chinese-style fast food.  Baked seafood (krab, shrimp, a little breading, and cheese nom nom), Krab rangoon, egg drop soup, chicken on a stick, pepper steak, pot stickers, dumplings, steam buns, and spare ribs--all of these have I tried, and all of them were mighty fine.    The only downfall is that the price for the buffet is a little higher than I like to pay, but they do have special nights where I think you can get the lunch price.  If you are in West CLE, and you want China buffet, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the dumplings at this restaurant-including the potstickers, dim sum, and even the ones in the wonton soup! They seem a big step above the typical frozen ones found in other restaurants (could they be home-made?). Many other tasty dishes to be had for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My husband and I Love the Oriental Palace! The food is Fanatastic!! They have a $5.24 lunch buffet on the weekdays...Monday-Friday....This is the Best deal in town!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not that anyone expects much from these under $10 Asian buffets, and if your one of those people is just as bad as you might expect it to be. As far as looks go it pretty gloomy and not cute. The food is nothing but average and edible but on the plus side it was hot...lol the server isn't required to do much, I had to ask for my drink, a straw, and utensils(several times).  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to splurge on our diet while spending chump change. Where else can you have all you can eat various sushi AND hot Asian food plus a large selection of ice cream for under $5? For $4.99 lunch and $7.99 dinner, the price is right. The selection is huge and almost everything is delicious. Every time we come here I have at least one plate of sushi/nigiri doused in spicy mayo and a plate of mushroom chicken - so good. If you push your empty cup to the edge of the table, it'll get refilled quickly - never had a problem there. The decor is tacky but fitting and the service staff is always nice. Overall, the price is right  and the selection is great."}
{"text":"Usually this place is a good value and the food is decent but my issues today are not about the food. The floor was so slippery and greasy I almost fell twice. Someone need to show them how to mop a floor to remove the greasy build-up."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but a very good value.  A nice Chinese buffet with tasty food.  The decor is unique with a kind of funky vibe.   The food is pretty much a standard selection, but what is out is well prepared and  tasty.  With a price of $4.99 for lunch a good value.  Not worth a special trip, but if you are nearby, worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I know, I know...why would someone rate a Chinese Buffet 5 stars?  Because, Oriental Palace Buffet is magical and deserves each and every one, that's why!  Where else can you get lunch for $4.99 and be completely overstuffed?? That's right...Oriental Palace Buffet.  Not only is the price right, but the food is delicious for what it is and usually fresh (depends on if you come in at the right time...try to go as early as you can). Service is polite and quick.  I have never tried their dinner buffet, however I might have to since it's only $7.99! Great place to go if you are looking for a quick and tasty lunch on a tight budget."}
{"text":"I frankly cannot believe the lack of 5 star ratings for this establishment.  We ordered carry out last evening.  Moo Goo Gai Pan, Hunan Beef and Chicken with Cashews, all staples of Chinese restaurants.  firstly, FRESH VEGETABLES,  seasonal  at that!  Zucchini, peppers, onions, and carrots all fresh and not crinkle cut frozen like I have gotten from nearly EVERY Chinese restaurant.  Meat was excellent and not overcooked.  Egg rolls....HAND MADE!!  All was indicative of  freshness as there was noted irregularity in the cut of the vegetables and size/shape of the egg roll.  OH, and lets not forget the exceptional service and free chicken skewers because they made them by mistake.  This is a carryout review, but I was amazed at how sizable and beautiful the interior was.  I will be trying a dine in experience soon.  Well done Oriental Palace.  I will NEVER go to Jackie Chen's again."}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews for this place. A buffet is a buffet.  If you complain about mass produced food then you really are nit picky.  The food was good.  Was it great. Nope!!!  But it's mass produced. I don't expect it to be excellent. If I wanted five star food.  I'd go to a five star restaurant.  Only reason for four stars is because this restaurant needs a update. It's stuck in the 90's.   Other than that. The food was good and I do recommend this place if you want a quick in and out.  Oh btw.  The prices are beyond reasonable. Lunch is $5.50 and dinner is $8.59.  So once again.  Complain about mass produced food.   Go ahead. Does it make you feel good about yourself. Lol."}
{"text":"Probably the most Westernized Asian buffet that I've been to in Cleveland.  The dishes are all fairly greasy.  On a Saturday night, there were some items that looked appetizing... and others that looked like they were out for a long time.  I glanced at the sushi section briefly - and didn't try any.  The California rolls looked okay, but I would be hesitant to try anything with raw fish.  Both of the steamed fish entrees offered were overcooked and did not taste the greatest.  The best things I had there were probably the fried items (sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken).     In summary, below average to average quality food in this buffet.  The one selling point here is the low price - hard to beat $7.99 for dinner at a Chinese buffet on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"This place is okay for the price lunch was 499 for all-you-can-eat.  They actually had Souci that was actually decent.   I really like the salmon and the chicken wings."}
{"text":"What constitutes \"food\" anyways?  What's that beige stuff, you ask? The stuff in the buffet table situated by the brown stuff? The stuff between the dark brown stuff or the light brown stuff? The fried stuff or suspiciously wet stuff?  Well I'm not sure but I ate some and I'm grabbing seconds!  *Instant hangover cure*"}
{"text":"The food trays that were not empty contained old dried food, there where flies on the sushi and only had the first glass of drink filled. Sorry but I will never go back!"}
{"text":"At the end of my esophagus is a bottomless black hole.    Sometimes regular meals will temporarily do the job of filling the endless vacuum, but sometimes it calls for something more drastic.  I've been coming to Oriental Palace for several years when I have an uncontrollable need to gorge myself, and in that time it has been pretty amazingly consistent as far as the food and service go, which is to say pretty good to better than expected.  The selection of items at both lunch and dinner is generally a little better than most Chinese buffets.  Lots of American-Chinese items, as well as some more pedestrian items (pizza, roast beef, etc.) for those that are scared of a little sweet and sour sauce.    They also have a small sushi selection, and in the evenings for the dinner buffet, there will also be some more authentic items for the more adventurous (salt and pepper frog legs, anyone?).    If you're in the mood for a Chinese buffet, it's probably safe to say you already know what it is you're getting into.  As far as these types of places go, Oriental Palace has been consistently good for years, and is worth your time to check out."}
{"text":"The wife and I went in for lunch. For $4.99 you can't beat the price. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of items. The food was as good as any Chinese take out. I will say, even better. The host and server were both pleasant. We will definitely return for another visit. Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"I think I like the feel, look and memories of going with my Father and Bros, or a good group of friends.   Its definitely not official, Hispanics are the main employees. The Asians just stay in the floor and ket them okay the background.   My first time having frog legs was here and they just taste like, bland chicken, id say. Either way buffet, cant go wrong."}
