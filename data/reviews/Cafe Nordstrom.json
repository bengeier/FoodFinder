{"text":"I popped in here while running an errand at the mall and had a serious craving for the Nordstrom tomato + basil soup. Guys - no one else makes it like them, i've tried it so many places and none of them have come close! It is just so dang good! I've tried to re-create it at home and have come close but still not the same. Even after all of these years, I can still count on their soup being just what the doctor ordered. In addition to the cup of soup, I got a 1/2 Cilantro Lime Salad with Chicken. It was very fresh, cold/crispy lettuce and pretty tasty! I liked the dressing as well. It was lacking a little on the ingredients though {give me all the fixins!!}. For a cup of soup and 1/2 salad my total was $13 and some change. I just got a glass for water as my drink. A little pricey but hey, i'll do anything for that soup!! ;)"}
{"text":"I love Nordstrom Cafe. It's always good, the place is cute and they have so many options. The chicken Parmesan crusted salad is my favorite. My sister loves the blackened salmon salad. It's all really good and the perfect place to eat at if you want to grab a bite in the mall. I always want to try there dessert but if I do I know I'll have it all the time. Overall good service , good food, and cool ambiance."}
