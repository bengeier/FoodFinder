{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant for a plethora of reasons! During the weekends, in the evenings, there is a pianist who maintains the intimate, inviting ambiance. The owners and Chef have always come to our table, ensuring any of our needs were met. Moreover, the menu is spectacular - each visit, I have tried something new, and I have yet to be disappointed. It's rare that you find an establishment that is of such high quality that makes each patron feel like family."}
{"text":"We came here after looking up restaurants in the local area and wow what a great choice the restaurant  was amazing we got seated with in two minutes the food was with us with in 10 minutes of sitting down and it was so good and the staff were friendly and treated me and my wife like long lost family if you are in this area and want Italian food must try here"}
{"text":"good beer poor food not hot service slow"}
{"text":"My meal was outstanding as well as the  entertainment and bar atmosphere. The muddles and pasta were the best!"}
{"text":"Introduction My wife was willing to go out in public again with me. She took a big risk by going with 2 other couples. I must have behaved pretty well. I never got my hand slapped.  Overall Rating- 3-4 Stars  Food - 3-4 Stars I had the Pappardelle Bolognese ($20). It was pretty good. I love lots parmasan cheese on my pasta - more than any reasonable human being would want. This is one of those restaurants that uses a grinder. The gal was grinding at the table for me. After 90 seconds I felt sorry for her and let her go before I got enough. (I'll have to start carrying a can of Kraft parmasan cheese with me.)  One of the other men got the Monkfish Scaloppini - $25. He said it was quite good (then again, he's a very diplomatic guy). One of the women got it too and said it was too black for her taste. (She originally ordered the Peasant Combo - $18. When she did, the server waived her off of it with a negative nod. - - - Milo (owner), if you're reading this, no, I can't tell you which server that was!)  One of the women got the Chicken Picatta $18. She said it was very good, but on the tasteless side.  Service - 3 Stars The server was OK, but seemed rushed, despite we were only 1 of the 4 tables in a room of 20+ table that had guests. It was another one of these cases in which the server was willing to make 3 trips to the kitchen for 3 separate items. (I remember my father-in-law telling me about a man he knew who was so unproductive that if he needed 3 stamps, he would go to the Post Office 3 times!)  Price - 2 Stars Virtually everything is a-la-carte. So, if you buy a medium priced entr√©e, a salad, and 1 drink/glass of wine, tax, and tip, it's tough to see how a couple gets out of there for less than $100. That may be the average cost for very good Italian cuisine these days, but there are good alternative restaurants that will cost you less. - - - I'm into value more than \"presentation\" and \"ambiance\".  Accommodations - 4 Stars When you go out to eat with 6, it is best to have a round table. We did and it makes it much more enjoyable. As we arrived at 6:15, we would actually hear each other talk! When you get to be may age, that can be a challenge. If you invite me out to dinner at a noisy restaurant and you mention something bad that is going on in our life and I say, \"That's good\", just slap me.  Atmosphere - 5 Stars The decor was fine, but I gave it 5 stars because of the piano player. Dennis was amazing. He played classical and pop music. He took requests, played about anything without any sheet music. - - - I did stump him, though. I asked him if he would/could play either (A) Prokofiev's Piano Concerto #3 the 3rd Movement or (B) Greenback Boogie. (I have a very eclectic music preferences.)  By the way, the Prokofiev piece is the most extraordinary musical performance I've ever seen. You can watch it on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= KDfGBmbNbMw. The YouTube video is almost 33 minutes long. If that it too much classical piano music for you, start at the 27:45 point. It will be the fastest 3 minutes of your life. Watch the pianist's hands closely. They sometimes move faster than the shutter speed on the camera. It is an amazing physical feat. The pianist is always exhausted afterwards."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten dinner here several times and we can't say enough about the food and service.  Love!  We usually order every single appetizer on the menu and just create a huge spread on our table to share.  I couldn't pick a favorite item if you forced me to... it's all amazing and we fight over every last morsel.    Last time we went we night capped in the pianno bar area and had a blast!  We met new people and enjoyed tons of laughs in the relaxing atmosphere.    I wish we lived closer, we'd eat here every night!  lol"}
{"text":"Met friends after work at Valentis for apps and to share a bottle of wine. I was impressed with the selection and value of their bottled wine list. We enjoyed a nice Soave and ended up staying for dinner, James our waiter guided us through the menu and I choose the veal piccata it was AMAZING, such a delicate sauce! Us girls shared a slice of the Sicilian cassata cake and a piece of ricotta pie both equally delicious. The four of us had such a wonderful evening we will be back!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I go out of my way to write a review.  In this case, I MUST.  It seems that I am, more often than not, disappointed with some part of my meal wherever we go on our bi-weekly date night.  I choose, in those cases, not to write a review because I'm concerned with hurting the restaurant. Maybe it was a bad night - who knows!  Tonight was different.  Valenti's has been opened for a mere 3.5 weeks. That's right.  However, they are running it like a restaurant that's been around for years.  Valenti's is soon to become the neighborhood gem.  Our server, Amy, was a very attentive server and probably one of the best we've had in years compared to any restaurant we've visited.  We started with the bread that was both crunchy on the outside and very chewy on the inside.  With it came with two delicious dipping sauces.  The artichoke spread was amazing and I made the comment that I would like a container to go because it was that good. Amy brought me a small container to go! (Thank you!!!!)  Our appetizer was a lightly crusted calamari with a just right marinara sauce.  The calamari was tender as it should be.  Hold on to your seats... My chosen entree was the special of  homemade ricotta gnocchi with sausage. Holy smokes this was some good stuff.  If I had to make a suggestion, it would be to make it a touch spicier even though it really is good as is.  My husband enjoyed a delicious margherita pizza which was baked perfectly.  The bottles of wine were well priced and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Hess for a mere $28. (Not bad for restaurant pricing.)  The owner, Milo, was out visiting with diners and he even took me back to the kitchen to show me the pastas were made every morning.  There is absolutely nothing I would complain about this particular date night.  Eveything was perfect.  Valenti's will now be our neighborhood gem!  When going, ask for Amy as your server!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip. The bar service is outstanding. Many may not like the food because it is closer to real Itailian than they are used to, your issue is wanting Olive Garden and not going there. However, for you foodies it is way too high  in salt, but still a good meal. The issue is, they don't know who they are. I had great, savy bar maids then servers that didn't know marinara from bolognese. They did, however, at a high middle age have the ability to stick an i pad in front of me and my dinner  mates and proceed w a tutorial of why this important to me instead of a list and answering my questions, and how to use a touch screen. Being $200. Into the evening at this point I asked to speak to the owners who claimed some people loved a tutorial by a waitress on an ipad while trying to socialize w people they enjoy and dine. Maybe, I am not so sure they are not latent out of touch reality kids paying rent at their parents, let alone earning what Valentis needs to collect on dinner to pay their rent. Figure it out, and you are the hosts, how about decent dress, make up etc.  When you are at work. If ethnic club staff are waiting on me giving  lessons to dining, spaghetti dinner ought to be 6.99.  Go shopping, go dining, get a clue."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting Valenti's on Tuesday May 7, I had a wonderful time....the atmosphere was so relaxing and fun as they just so happened to have Karaoke what live entertainment I thoroughly enjoyed myself.......the service was good and favorite part the DaMa red wine absolutely deelish.....if you haven't tried them stop on by and check them out....I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Arrived promptly at 7:30 for a reservation for two.  We were told nothing was available and the noncaring receptionist wouldn't even give us an estimate of when we might get the table we reserved.  We went to the bar and before ordering spotted the manager/owner.  When we told him of this situation he offered us two seats at a \"community table\" of twelve.  Certainly not what we were interested in.  You would think that he might have had the smarts to offer us a glass of wine.  Quite frankly he didn't seam to care.  So, we left and went to Hyde Park for a great memorable meal."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Took 45 minutes to get a glass of wine. Afterwards never came back to see if we wanted another glass. Had to ask a hostess for a menu and than chase down our waitress to order. For a restaurant in a nice area of town I was dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Alas, a very disappointing meal.  Our server, while pleasant,  seemed extremely harried, and we waited for a good 20 minutes before our drinks were delivered. Meanwhile, there were several other servers standing by the kitchen, gossiping, so maybe not a staffing issue? There was a table of people next to us who may have been the owners or friends of the owners who were being fawned over while others, including us, in the nearby vicinity were studiously ignored. The food was not much better, with a limp, chewy calamari appetizer (although the marinara dipping sauce was quite good) that suggested it was quick fried from a bulk frozen bag. Chicken parmigiana was Ok, if uninspired. It was supposed to come with the vegetable of the day, which was creamed corn with pancetta, an awful combination, if you ask me. We asked for a substitution and got broccoli rabe, which I normally love, but which was swimming in so much butter that it was slimy.  The service was so slow that we opted out of dessert. The long bar in the center of the room was hopping but the chatty patrons, along with really loud rock and roll music, made the dining experience even less pleasant. We have no need to go back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Everything is a la carte  $18 for spheghetti really !! And slow service to top that which means adios to this establishment. Wouldn't recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Just ok-3 stars all the way. Pizza was ok, service was ok, eggplant Parm was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was incredible and service was right on spot.  This is more a Sicilian style restaurant which made it more pleasurable to me since I'm Sicilian myself and accustomed to this style of cooking"}
{"text":"Worst chicken piccata I've ever had. This place put an entire onion, practically raw, in the dish. Never had chicken piccata with onion and never will again. The \"sauce\" was white and the only flavor was onion. I believe the calamari was the frozen kind. I bet this place doesn't last much longer."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews... but this place was terrible!  We had a group of 7, not an oddly large group. Most retaurants just push two tables together. Here, the plop a random large table right next to the door and the host stand and call it their VIP table. Not only does everyone walking in watch you eat, but its right next to the kitchen and super busy... No thanks  Wine: An italian restaurant that doesnt serve bottles of wine or carrafes? This is supposed be Italian, right? I'll leave it at that.  Pizza? If you call dough with a salad on top pizza... I order the procuitto and red pepper pizza which was supposed to have goat cheese and arugula on it. Sounds fantastic. I got an overly doughy \"pizza\" with no sauce, 3 pieces of proccuitto and a side salad on top. NOT a pizza.   To top it all off the service was terrible, we brought a cake and asked for coffee with it. Got our coffee as we were ready to go.   NOT IMPRESSED"}
{"text":"This isn't a fine dining restaurant, rather it is a casual dining restaurant with tasty food. They aim to please and have live entertainment. The wings that I ordered from the bar while watching football were delicious! Drinks are good too."}
{"text":"This rating is based on food quality and staff encounters. I had an overpriced shrimp and linguini dish that was okay, but nothing to write home about. The sauce was simply bland--no bite, no spice. The server was nice enough. But later in the evening, I noticed another server being kind of short with a guest. It was an unapologetic type of act in response to a complaint. In short, I won't be back. Though the entertainment was good--a live band, and the group I went with along with the crowd at the restaurant,  was wonderful."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at this restaurant this evening and found some of the dishes to be excellent, and the others very good.  We were two couples and ordered 4 different entrees which we shared  (A great way to enjoy several of the dishes and which they were happy to serve in a way we could do this).   One was Capanelli pasta with sausage and Shrimp. This was excellent.  The sauce was sort of a pink sauce (part cream, part marinara) and was quite excellent.  The sauce had some spiciness to it, in part from the sauce and in part from the sausage.  Another was the Ratatouille Nicoise.  This is a French style vegetable stew.  I am not usually excited by vegetarian dishes but this was fantastic.   One dish was the Classical Italian meatballs and spaghetti. It was good.  Another was the eggplant lasagna.  Again, good in a traditional Italian way.  The prices were very good considering the quality of the food!  It was a lovely evening and we ate outside on the patio.  Delightful.  Not noisy at all.    We felt like this is a somewhat unknown east side Italian/French Restaurant which is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"In a world (at least a neighborhood) of waaay too many Italian restaurants, I was pleased to try Valenti's!  I had the Pasta Aglio e Olio....FINALLY a place that didn't just serve noodles with too much garlic and swimming in oil.  The ratio was perfect!   The atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable with friendly service!"}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW DOES NOT APPLY TO RATATOUILLE.  Valenti's was amazing while it lasted.   I can't believe anyone would rate Valenti's anything less than a 5. I love Valenties, a diamond in the rough.  All of the menu items I've tried have been just fantastic. They have a brick oven to and make fantastic authentic Italian pizzas. Add salmon to whatever salad you order, they are always cooked to a perfected medium, crispy on the outside.  Last but not least the oil and bread served with every meal. Oh the oil! I despise green olives I always have, this oil has minced green olives and it's amazing.  The prices are reasonable.  Table for 2 will run you about $30-$40 depending on your add-ons (appetizers, wine, etc)."}
{"text":"Giving Valenti's 5 stars was as easy as finding sand on a beach - authentic, fresh, incredible, and delightful Italian cuisine that won't break your wallet.  This establishment is a classy breakaway from the usual mill of cookie cutter chains that have no identity.  The pizza here is amazing, cooked to order in the massive imported Italian stone oven that sits at the far end of the bar, while the entrees are to die for.  No matter what you order, the food here is as good as it gets and combines the basic dishes with the more complex creations that you'd find in Italy."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Valenti's, and I was very pleased. I had dinner there with a friend, we both ordered salads as starters, I had the arugula salad, which was very simple, but very tasty.  Arugula dressed with fresh lemon juice and EVOO, topped with red onion and  shaved parmesan.....excellent!  I then ordered a flatbread pizza topped with sausage and mushroom bianco.....very good.  The Italian bread served with dinner was warm, slightly crusty and delicious.  My friend and I shared a slice of cheesecake with raspberry sauce, NY style, very good, but a little bit pricey ($8.00), same price as the pizza:-(.  Our server was not as attentive as we would have liked, long wait between refills, next course, check etc.  The Executive Chef stopped by our table to see if we enjoyed our meal.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ive decided to be short on specifics tonight.  I  wish I could leave 3 or even 2 stars but in good conscience I cannot.   this is my third time here.  The first two were \"eh.....\"  My experience tonight could have been very disappointing but the good bartending service saved it.  The food? Valentis  isn't  a dining destination but its ok.  The atmosphere? Great. Looooooong bar.  Piano player with a portable piano.  Fun place.  And very good service.  On balance .....4 stars. ... We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots to eat and drink.  We love it so much we had our Rehearsal Dinner in the newly renovated dinning room.  Picked up dinner tonight, enjoyed a great glass of wine and had the pleasant surprise of the gnocchi available as a special!!!  This used to be on the regular menu, and I so hope they bring it back- my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"I actually went to another place across the parking lot and stood in the bar for a few minutes with no response from anyone. I walked out and saw this hidden gem while pulling out. I walked in and immediately loved the look of this place. Then the piano man Dennis was belting out some great tunes on the piano. I sat at the bar and Lauren promptly greeted me and made me feel like I was a regular. People started filling the bar and the place emitted so much good energy I knew I found a keeper. Angel the other bartender was bubbly on top of it and seemed liked she knew me for years. I ordered the Chicken Piccata which I am very critical of as I make this dish more than I like to admit. It came out perfect. I talked with Dino the chef here and he walked me through the whole process and said to come back and watch them prepare it next visit. I will definitely take him up on this. Then Linda ( owner I believe) talked with me for a few minutes about the place which she didn't have to do but I feel that is one of the reasons this place is so special. The staff is fantastic. The clientele was fun and the overall experience was first rate. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before dining here.   I can understand the mixed reviews, though.   I had a wonderful evening even though the service was spotty and food was sometimes a miss.   Loved the garlic butter with fresh bread - yum!   Calamari was fair - too crusted and fried for my taste.    Cioppino was good - not the usual tomato based.   My date enjoyed his whole trout with spinach.   We really enjoyed sitting after dinner at the long bar listening to the cute couple singing Sinatra tunes.   It was a very pleasant evening...PS   walked in at about &:30 with no reservation.    The place was pretty busy but we were happy to get a table right away.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great italian food, good service, friendly staff and an all around clean restaurant. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"We went to Valenti's on a whim decision.  We walked in around 7:15 on a Saturday night, & were immediately greeted by a friendly host staff, & waited under 5 minutes for our table.  The place seemed very lively, & extremely loud with live music in the bar area.  We thought it would be a perfect place for our 2 & 4 year old.   We were unaware that this restaurant was not at all kid friendly, but soon discovered it was.  Our server was friendly, but was observed rolling her eyes on numerous occasions (asking for a kid's menu, bread). She seemed very impatient and did not seem to pay attention to our orders fully.   The bread took over 10 minutes to arrive. It was worth the wait as we enjoyed it very much.   Then our main entrees arrived about 10 minutes after the bread.   We explained that we did not receive our salad, the server put the blame on the food runner and offered to pack it up and not charge us.   I expressed that was unnecessary, & that we would still enjoy our salad along with our main course. During this time my 21 month old  had a small outburst and a few patrons seemed upset. I apologized and calmed him down. Back to enjoying our dinner, everything was going smoothly until I ordered dessert.  I asked if the Spumoni was made in house, to where the server replied, \"we don't have Spumoni\". I simply pointed to it on the menu and she shrugged and explained they must be out of it.  My son noticed carrot cake in the deli window in front of the hostess stand, and ordered that (it wasn't on the menu, nor were we informed of it's addition for the evening.) I ordered the \"coppa pistachio\" which sounded heavenly to me. It was described as a \"pistachio gelato with crushed pistachio over top\". I was a bit surprised when the server brought me something completely different which appeared to have grapes on top. When I questioned her, she simply stated, \"this is what you ordered\". She then brought a menu over and I pointed to what I really had ordered.  She apologized, returned in 5 minutes to inform me that they were out of the dessert that I had ordered.   We got the check and were about to pay when we overheard (VERY clearly) the owner at another patron's table say \"Isn't it a bit late for children to be up?\"  (At this point it was 8:45 pm). Everyone at the table turned to look at us, & embarrassed as we were, we sat patiently and waited to pay the check (10 minutes to bring me change). We even asked another server for change and she rudely replied, \"no, I don't have change\". Without an offer to get us change or get our server to break our $20 bill). What server doesn't have change for a $20?? Come on.  On our way out, I let the owner know that  I heard his comment and was insulted. He lied to me saying he didn't say what I think he said. I told him we will not be back, & he replied, \"good!\"  Our first clue that they didn't like kids, should've been the lack of a kid's menu. I agree if a place doesn't have a children's menu, then you shouldn't bring them, but there is a less crass way to approach the situation.  Maybe explain that they don't cater to children?    The bottom line, while, Valenti's food was delicious, the service was less than desirable, & kids are not welcome."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to make of this place. I'm so confused. Confounded. Check it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 8 and I think we tried almost everything on the menu between the appetizers, the bowls of pasta we ordered - just to taste, and the meals. Everything was delish! Everyone left raving about it. They don't have a huge wine selection, but what they have is really nice and Lauren knows her wines!  Great night!"}
{"text":"So, I love the entertainment and ambiance at this restaurant. The owners are always present and welcoming. I love Stacey the bartender.   They need some work on the food. My side of pasta was cold. Ugh! The Veal Piccata was boring and for 24.00 I expected more than four small pieces.   The Pesto Red Snapper was bland, lacking any pizzazz.  The pasta was lukewarm and hand churned Parmesan cheese was not offered, let alone cracked pepper.  You have a beautiful restaurant and great service. If your food would be equal you have a winner. Step it up a few notches!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had. but wait I didn't actually eat my dinner because it had no flavor. Not to mention no salt,pepper,cheese,or pepper flakes.......even a pizza shop has that on their table.And when I told the owner it wasn't good, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away. Horrible service. I wouldn't waste your time or money. Cleveland has a lot of really good Italian restaurants......this just isn't one if them"}
{"text":"Had dinner here while I was in town on business.  The food is excellent.  The freshly made pasta is amazing and definitely sets this restaurant apart from many of the mock Italian joints I've been to.  The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  The decor is sort of cheap and the layout of the restaurant is a little thrown together, but it's an acceptable trade off for the quality of the food.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review. I really do. They make it look like they're trying. But unless you want to pay 20+ a plate for stale bread, or waiting 2 and a half hours for 10 long neck clams so well done I can only compare them to chewing gum, over linguini (severely over done) then this is this place isn't for you. My dining partners got ratatouille that was so sweet they described it in horror like the famous (infamous) pasta sauce called Ravi. As far as ambiance it is unbearably loud. Don't expect to hear your dinner guests. I rarely write bad reviews but my experience and everyone around my table's was terrible. Two couples got up and left.  Dear management, get a new wait staff or do some retraining. If you would like to discuss my review/opinion with me please pm me."}
{"text":"They received one star ONLY because I couldn't write a review with zero stars.......  The absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.    First, we had made reservations for 12 people, weeks in advanced.  Confirmed our reservations the morning of. When we arrived they only had a table set for 10.  Their solution was to give us an additional table in the corner so that 2 lucky people could be separated from the rest of our group. Well we weren't having that....and finally they brought 2 additional chairs to our table. 2 chairs that were bar stools, so 2 people had to sit much higher than the table making it impossible for them to eat comfortably.   Reservations were at 7:30. It was 8:30 before we received bread (which we had to ask for) still no one has taken our order. And we were having to get up from our table to order drinks at the bar....since our waiter was to preoccupied with other tables. Once we did place our order it was another 45 min before we received our food.   A couple in our group ordered lobster ravioli, about 30 mins after we placed our order they were told they ran out of it.  At this point everyone in our group was upset, and we asked to speak with the owner......this is where it gets good.  We voiced our issues to the owner who replied with \"I do this for fun, I don't feel like arguing so we will just take our food back\"  We were dumbfounded by his response.  Some people continued to eat, I gladly gave my food back.     In an attempt to fix the issue the owner did bring out lobster ravioli (that he must of pulled out of his ass, since they supposedly had just sold the last of it about 20 min ago and proceeded to say \"here is ur ravioli, so don't complain because I myself made it for you\" What a cocky SOB.  If I wasn't there celebrating a friends birthday I would have walked out right then and there.   When the bills came, they ended up charging me for my pasta, and literally hand wrote a 20% gratuity on each of the the checks. How ballsy is that?!  No tips were given, and portions of the bills went unpaid.  I have never had such an unprofessional experience in my life. I will NEVER go back..... And strongly advises that no one give business to those assholes either!"}
{"text":"Great buffet for Mother's Day - good options, except, as an Italian restaurant, they were missing the bagels and schmear to go along with their perfectly smoked salmon.  To me, that is a brunch staple! Great meat carving station , lots of dessert choices, and the location was good.  The harpist was great!"}
{"text":"i was hesitant to eat here after reading some of the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service.  The general manager came to our table two times to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and he could not have been more friendly.  Our server was very good, and  super friendly as well.  The food was very good.  Had the Broccolini which was very good.  Our table shared a few of the desserts which were also very good.  I would go back for sure.  Maybe the restaurant had a few kinks in the beginning but they are clearly trying to make up for this from what i could tell...."}
