{"text":"It great fast food and get large portions. It seem to be fresh and the server are friendly. I gone there many time and it alway good. I like their burritos usually it so big can only eat half and save the rest. I am recommending it to all my friends. You can choose what you want with any of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a train wreck. The owner and management should be embarrassed to have such an under trained staff. Also the quality of food is all over the place, sometimes good and sometimes horrible. It's really sad how often we go someplace else just because of the low quality and horrible costumer service when it could all be fixed so easily. Boooooo"}
{"text":"This location has the worst service. Every. Single. Time. They are impressively slow. They never have whip cream for the desserts. The machine is always broken or they're out. We've complained to corporate so many times about this and *surprise surprise* nothing ever changes. The food is still decent for the most part but this location in particular makes me want to stop coming to cafe rio."}
{"text":"So this is the second time in a couple weeks I've taken the time out of my body day to stop off and grab a bite to eat. Its also the second time in a row now that the line to get served has extended quite some distance. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time round...  I've now been stood in June for 18 minutes and still have several people before me.   I love eating here, but the time it takes to get served is ridiculous. Sad to day it, but I just won't bother stopping by here any more for lunch. There's just not enough time in the day to justify it.   My advice to everyone, don't bother between 12pm and 1:30pm"}
{"text":"I loved this place the first time I went however, he 5 or 6 times I have been since seem to be a total disappointment.  Hanging onto my first experience is what kept me going back but I'm pretty sure now I'm down  line is crazy long, which typically would be a great thing however, I have noticed it seems to be because they are disorganized and very slow.  They seem to always be out of something queso, Chios, steak, and even tortillas!  The most disappointing part is he manager can be a real jerk.  He isn't apologetic or accommodating it seems like he could care less that there is a problem."}
{"text":"Something fell apart here on July 2nd at 8:30p.  While in line, I ordered a fire grilled chicken burrito. The woman tried forcing the other chicken option when I protested she said it'd be 20 minutes for fire grilled chicken. How does that happen? Throwing up my arms- I decided to wait it out. To my left a woman ordered two tacos and was very specific about her order being separated. They botched that. Combining the tacos with one side of salad and rice. Since It turned into a huge line - I went to the checkout and use my full frequent customer card. Instead of checking me out I had to wait 10 minutes with two other livid customers. One of which had been waiting some time for napkins to be refilled and another fuming that he didn't get his desert for his son. What a mess. Needless to say, I paid and picked up my disaster of a burrito - over-packed with fire-grilled chicken and ripped in 3 places. Except they were convinced I hadn't paid yet. Had to present my receipt for that.   With their kitschy slogan  \"every meal a masterpiece\" this was a charlatan's Jackson Pollock. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place had some of the best Mexican food I ever had, made freshly right in front of my eyes. The food makers were nice enough to take me through my options, since it was my first time eating here, even though the line was getting long. I'm a fan of El Pollo Loco, which is great for lunch on a work day but I think Cafe Rio was a little better."}
{"text":"I like Cafe Rio. The food is good, but nothing super authentic. It's very similar to Chipotle, except a tad more expensive. However, you do get a ton of food with your order, which is good. I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place... But I must say I have converted to chipotle. Cafe rio is much less healthy than chipotle and since I am allergic to gluten, there is almost nothing gluten free on the menu. Even the rice and beans have gluten in them! There is no reason for there to be gluten in rice or beans. I guess they put a lot of extra stuff in their food."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is great.  I have eaten at their location on Eastern and am a regular at this location on Sahara.  They make their tortillas fresh by the minute, right in front of where you order.  They have great salads, burritos, quesadillas and tacos made to order.  Their two salad dressings are not to be missed- cilantro vinaigrette and jalapeno ranch (I get them on the side of everything!).  On Tuesdays they have special coconut shrimp tacos with mango salsa that are great.  They also do a very fresh chicken tortilla soup, which comes with a tortilla.  Their black and pinto beans are both vegetarian, their rice is seasoned with cilantro and lime and they offer wheat tortillas, if you prefer.  They offer two types of unsweetened iced tea at the fountain, a tropical and a blackberry green (score!!).  We take all our visitors here and even our So Cal friends are impressed with the shredded chicken tacos!  I love this place and my husband is a Cafe Rio addict, I only wish they were open later."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, and this location is no exception. I ordered the pork enchiladas, and they were great. There was a very generous portion of meat and the workers were kind enough to give me extra pico de gallo for free."}
{"text":"Food mediocre at best, way over priced 1.19 for tiny scoop guacamole. Plus, they charge for every dressing or salsa to a company dry burrito.  Tried this for friends recommendation so he can try Zabaz..which is far superior.  No management in site and employees don't know how to handle unhappy guest. Never again. ...too bad"}
{"text":"Well, I was excited. I had a Buy one Get one free coupon from Facebook. So I called my brother and talked to him and his wife, and we decided to drive out there and make a day of it. I drove 40 minutes to my brothers house, picked them up, and drove 25 minutes to Café Rio. We waited about 25 minutes in line, and after we ordered our food the very rude lady behind the counter told us that we had to print our coupons. I find it super interesting that we had to print our coupons, because I went to the café Rio on Saturday in Chandler and they used the one on my phone just fine. The food tasted good, but the service was worse than bad. If a customer has a coupon, it doesn't matter if it's digital or on paper; we are in the 21st-century. I doubt we will be going back because of this experience."}
{"text":"Food is good but everyone that works there is extremely rude. I've came in multiple times before and every time the staff is very unfriendly and rude."}
{"text":"My experience here was better then expected after reading some reviews while in line. I decided to give this place 4 stars because the food (sweet pork & chicken tacos) was very good overall. The tortillas & ingredients were fresh and the atmosphere was fun.  What wasn't so good was the fact that some soda choices (e.g. Root-beer) were out of syrup. The time in line waiting to order while watching them prepare food (around 15 min ) seemed too long. It was a Monday night when I stopped in, and I don't know how it is at other times but overall I would say, even though the food tastes good if you only have a couple of minutes this place may not work for you."}
{"text":"The nachos are awesome. We are so happy that they opened near our house.  The dessert is incredible as well."}
{"text":"The service is horrible.  We support local business and we tried to give this establishment the benefit of the doubt.   They could never get our orders right.  When we tried ordering online, our food was never ready at the promised time.    Last night, we ordered the chicken salad and pork salad and again...it was not ready at the promised time. After finally getting it home, we discovered there was no pork in the pork salad. We brought it back and asked to speak to the manager. She was apologetic but offered nothing to keep our business.   We will never do business with the Cafe Rio chain again."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst \"Mexican\" food I've ever had. Not authentic at all. The \"salsas\" they make taste like they came out of a can. Their twist on Mexican food is a joke. Don't waste your time. This place seems like a wanna be Chipotle."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for dinner. They raved about it. The prices are high, more than the $10 it shows here on Yelp. My friend came especially for salad but they had no dressing. What? No salad dressing. And when she inquired if they were making more, a guy snapped no. My friend said very politely that it would've been nice to know there was no salad dressing  when she ordered it. Then she would've ordered something different. Same guy, no comment. Pretty much ignored us. He was not friendly. I got the nachos. They were okay but definitely not worth the price my friends paid. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This locations is better than the one on Stephanie and Warm springs"}
{"text":"Overall, they have delicious food, but we ordered lunch for an office meeting, only to get it to the office and find out that the nachos were soggy and cold, my burrito was tasty but again cold as if it came straight out of the refrigerator. We were a little disappointed this time around. They seemed super busy and short staffed which could have been the result of our cold food. We also informed them that we wanted the food ready for pick up by 12:40 (we called it in at 10:45 and on the receipt it stated \"pick-up time 11:04) which we think our food sat for almost 2 hrs.  Again, food is delicious, just disappointed in quality this time."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Cafe Rio around 40-50 times since August when I moved to this side of town. This trip was by far the worst I've had. I walked in at 9:52 as they closed at 10:00. Understandable that the employees were anxious to leave, but I just wanted my free salad I earned with rewards! I walked in and there were upwards of 25 people sitting around eating and carrying on. Fairly unusual. As I approached the counter, not only could I see the employees unhappiness, but I could hear them complaining about the amount of people in the store. (I'm sure the owner wouldn't complain)   Anyhow, a male employee asked me verbatim \"what can I do for you?\" I'm not going to go into how misjudged this approach is to customer service, so I'll leave it alone. However, when I responded with \"yeah can I get a salad to go please\" his first response was \"well this is all the rice we have left so (he paused for a second as I stared at him) I'll just give you the rest\" There was about 2 spoonfuls of rice left. As he goes to scoop he looked up to see more people walk in to order and quickly changed that 2 spoonfuls to a half scoop. Sweet dude. Then, he passed it along to a young woman employee who while she was making the salad was speaking in Spanish to another girl employee complaining about the people still in restaurant. (Hehe, I happen to speak Spanish, what are the odds right?)   In the end, I will say if you go here I guess don't go after 9:30 because apparently you'll get upset employees who of course didn't sign up for the 2-10 shift or you'll get half a scoop of rice from a male employee who clearly isn't in it for repeat business.   Also, she forgot the lime. And if you have had the salad you know that the lime is a delightful touch that really makes the salad a \"salad.\""}
{"text":"To begin, we waited in line for about 10-15 minutes.  Then, we yelled at the people prepping our food to order.  After ordering, the preppers grabbed cold food and stuck it in a foil tin (all running together), and ran it through an oven before setting it down in front of the cash register.   After paying, we sat down to eat.  My food was very cold in places (unmelted cheese); the cilantro-lemon rice was gross, and the pinto beans were all over everything else on my tin."}
{"text":"Great place to eat , good food , quick and easy! All of family loves it!"}
{"text":"Café Rio is my favorite little fast - food Mexican restaurant. They have a cute \"Mexican styled\" restaurant and you can almost always count on friendly employees. A+ customer service is definitely something they aim for. They will often ask to take your tray or bring you something (eg. dressing, tortillas, or anything not quite ready at the moment). Around lunch time Café Rio hits their \"rush hour\" and although there are plenty of seating both inside and outside you may have a little trouble finding a seat for you and your friends! Another thing to be expected around lunch time is the lines are longer than usual, but the wait is worth it if you ask me.  The delicious, fresh, fairly cheap food is always something I look forward to eating with a few friends after class or a long day of shopping. Contrary to the good, the meat is a little sweet for some peoples liking which is why some people prefer Chipotle over Café Rio, but the sweet meat is giving their food their own style. I'm a vegetarian, so I don't have to worry about this. Go me!  You can find Café Rio restaurants all over the valley. This makes it easy to get a quick, filling meal no matter where you are. It's kind of like McDonalds... But fresh and actually taste good! Plus, they cater! My family uses the catering services they offer all the time for anything from baby showers to Super Bowl parties.  I would of course recommend Café Rio to anyone. More specifically a salad with house dressing and shredded lettuce, rather than the big pieces, this makes it easier to eat. I say give it a try. You don't have much to lose. Café Rio is trendy and cheap. Worst case, you don't like it and you're only out a few dollars."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Cafe Rio in The Henderson area. This location is down the street from my house and I go here for the convenience. I will no longer be eating here after today. I will make the extra trip and go to another Cafe Rio elsewhere. It amazes me how bad the service and food is here each and every time. I went In today around lunch and I was watching the lady make tortillas and saw her grab some food from the counter behind her and eat it with her hands with her gloves on. I thought she would change her gloves after putting them to her mouth but nope she continued to make the tortillas. This was the last straw for me and I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Great customer service from this location. Food was descent and dining area was clean."}
{"text":"Expected more. The use glove floating in the pintos was a deal breaker. Sorry guys it's time to clean house and hire new staff."}
{"text":"Sadly this review has been in the making for the last year and a half. I've been going to this location since it opened. The customer service keeps going down hill each time I go there. Sadly when I went there today I couldn't ignore what I witnessed. I almost just walked out as I watched my order being made. The person making my order came from the back wearing gloves but did not put fresh gloves on after coming from the back room then she grabbed a dirty rag and wiped down the area then grabbed a tortilla. Meanwhile another employee is putting lettuce and cheese back into the serving trays that fell out. Lots of sanitary issues going on plus bad customer service continues. I never see a manager supervising any of this. Time to go to a different location."}
{"text":"Just came here to eat cause it says online it's supposed to close at 11pm (it's is 10:17 pm now) got some cocky little guy with a Napoleon complex just shaking his head refusing to talk to me. Clearly they were already cleaning up but I just wanted to make them aware of the posted hours since I just drovw about 20 min to get here and as he walks up to the window finally um holding my phone in my hand to show him he just keeps repeating himself that they're closed.. no shit dude.. your not the brightest are ya?? Anyways finally told them they might wanna get their hours corrected especially if when people get here they have to deal with such a little turd!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after shopping at Costco.  The staff was friendly enough.  I got beef and pork tacos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  The food is very good for fast food.  I just wish that they had some mild sauces because not everyone likes hot sauce and burn your ass sauce.  Also, the counter is too high.  Little people like me can't see what's going on with our food! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and they make it all at the restaurant in front of you which is really cool. A little on the pricey side but I'm willing to pay for it because it's delicious."}
{"text":"Like others have stated, the service is very bad. One employee that puts lettuce and tomato on the food is always really careless and rushed even when there is not many people in line. He barely gives you any lettuce, and when you ask for more he looks very annoyed and gives you a tiny bit more on ONE of your tacos, then throws it quickly to the side to work on the next. This is a repeated occurrence with the same employee that we have noticed several times. Because he is rushing so fast, the orders get backed up at the salsa and end up getting mixed up, and you get somebody else's toppings on your tacos. I have also had the problem of getting cold/uncooked rice that is crunchy and had to just throw it out. They also have problems with the drink machines - the horchata is never consistent and is usually watery. Sometimes the soda fountain is not maintained so you just get a weird soda water heavy cup of coke. I understand having a bad experience occasionally, but the service and quality has been bad most times I have visited."}
{"text":"I am posting this just to see if the corporate office pays attention to their customers. I went in around 2:30 PM Saturday, November 5 to buy the Shredded Chicken Salad, one of my favorites. I am a regular customer here.   The woman at the front of the assembly line couldn't wait for me to get closer to her to place my order, she starts yelling can I help you over 3 other people.  I ignored her till I got closer and than said what I wanted. I also always ask that they drain the beans, ( I don't like the soggy bottom), so she puts rice and beans in the shell then says, \"Oh, I'm out of shredded chicken.\".  I asked if they had more, she hesitates, but didn't ask anyone and said no.  She tried to get me to go with the grilled chicken which of course costs more. I said no, and repeated my question to whether they had any more of the shredded chicken.   So I told her to forget it and left.     Now I should have called for a manager at that time but hunger and frustration made me not a nice person to deal with at that time.  I got in my car and went to another place to get lunch.  I then decided to call the management and report her.  They put a guy on the phone who sounded like a young kid and claimed he was the manager.  I explained the issue and told him that I felt she should have checked with the kitchen to be sure they were out and then offer me a substitution at no extra charge.   He then informs me that they were temporarily out of the shredded chicken but it was now there.    I was pissed!!  I let him know I was not returning that I had already ate.  He said okay, didn't offer up any discounts and said he would talk to the girl.     Very disappointed with you Cafe Rio.  I am a regular customer and have been for several years.   If this is how you treat those of us who give you steady business, perhaps we should go back to Chipotle Mexican Grill or find another mexican restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"First and last time we will ever eat here. The staff acts as if it is painful to be working, have zero customer service skills, and no personality. They are robots going through the motions. I ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken. I saw the guacamole that the menu stated I received with my order. When she asked me if i wanted the sour cream, pico, and guac I replied yes please. The guac she gave me was from another bin behind the counter that was brown and watery. I asked for the guac in the other bin that she had just told my husband was fresh. She replied that she had to give me this one and slapped a scoop of the nastiness on my food. The quesadilla wasn't cut which made it really hard to eat all folded up. Also we had the chips and queso. They give you a ton of chips which is a bonus but the queso was less to be desired. My husband had grilled steak tacos and he said they were very bland. The meal cost us about $30. Sadly, we can get more flavorable food for less the cost at Zabas next door."}
{"text":"Tonight we saw an employee laying in the dirt next to the restaurant smoking. He then got up and dusted the dirt off and went back inside! Now I know we won't be eating here. It is absolutely disgusting and anyone near food should not be laying in dirt on the job!"}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places that I actually crave. You can't go wrong with anything here but my favorite is the double enchilada plate with grilled chicken. The medium salsa is one of the best salsas I've had in a while. If you like guacamole, this place has you covered. Try it with salsa and cheese on top and you can thank me later! Besides the wait to order, I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to cafe rio for years, mainly in salt lake where it started. Love the food and my port burrito enchilada style with hot sauce was pretty good but the service was terrible. The young gal with the ray ban glasses thought it was more important I wipe off trays than it was to grab my food off the melter thing and ring me up. I'll come back, I just hope next time the employees treat me better and don't make it so obvious they're having a terrible day."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Cafe Rio in general.  I have frequented the Eastern, Maryland, Stephanie, St. George and Provo locations.  I am kind of a Cafe Rio veteran.  BUT I HATE the Horizon location. It is a frustration almost very time I go there.  I live right next to this location and have been there about 10 times because it is convenient.  I've just about had enough.  I probably should drive right past this location and go to the Stephanie location.  Or, because that is too far, across the street and eat Thai or Mediterranean.   I have read the reviews on Yelp, and I agree with them.  The main problems can be summed up as:  1) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time.  2) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x2)  3) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x3)  4) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x4)  5) They are sloppy on the line and tend to mix ingredients.  Not the end of the world, but a bit unpleasant.  So, out of the 10 times I have been there, they didn't have basic ingredients about 8 of those times.  My first time experiencing this, I had to wait for beans.  Another time I saw them run out of rice, which held up the line.  Twice I have waited for them to finish cooking pork while my family finished their meals.  I ended up with takeout.  I have seen them almost run out of cheese.   I've seen them run out of tortillas. TORTILLAS!  That is, in part, what kept me in line for 25 minutes tonight.  (There were only about 15 people in the line when I got there.)  Tonight I decided I didn't want pork or chicken.  That leaves shredded beef and steak.  Guess what! After waiting 25 minutes in line and waiting for them to fix their tortilla shortage, I learned that they were out of steak AND beef.  I was told I would have to wait another 8 minutes for them to cook steak.  They didn't bother to give an ETA for the beef.  I ate pork.  So, if they run out of rice, beans, tortillas, meat and almost cheese, what kind of a Mexican restaurant is this location?  Those ingredients are kind of what it means to serve Mexican food...  CAFE RIO CORPORATE!  PLEASE, GET SOMEONE IN YOUR HORIZON STORE WHO KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE THE LINE.  SOMEONE WHO CAN TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO ANTICIPATE WHEN THEY NEED TO START PREPARING THE FOOD SO YOU DON'T RUN OUT.  8 OUT OF 10 TIMES IS BAD!!!! REALLY, REALLY BAD!!!!  IT HASN'T IMPROVED SINCE YOU OPENED THIS LOCATION!  I also think the people there are slow workers.  That being said, I really like Cafe Rio food.  And the people there seem to be friendly and apologetic.  Please, Cafe Rio Corporate, let me love this location!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for years. I order a salad with extra steak and charged me $3.00 for extra steak sign states $1.50 not $3.00 steak was very much over cooked and not worth the $1.50 or $3.00 and extra cilantro. I always get an extra house dressing on the side ( one is never enough) lol. The last time I ordered my salad they where cooking fresh tortillas but when I ordered they tried to give me an old one that had be sitting around for some time. I didn't mind waiting. I asked for shredded lettuce for my salad and extra cilantro. Ordered 2 house dressings and A side of guacamole. The order was to go. I got home to find out guacamole was not on my salad like it's been for years. I was not happy at this point and called the number on the receipt. The air head on the phone said did you ask for it on the side I said yes. Then she explains to me that there have be a few changes to the sides and what comes with everything. When I walked in I seen new menu signs but not new side item that cost extra. This use to be my favorite place to eat but not anymore. The lady on the phone didn't even want to make me happy (like next time you come in we will fix it) she didn't want to be bothered with anything. You keep getting bad reviews everyone will need to find a new job. Very unhappy and I didn't deserve the attitude on the phone like she was to busy to talk to me and was rushing to get off the phone with me. Sorry but that's not good customer service I expect from a place like Café Rio. I won't be going back so you just lost a very loyal customer over young kids that don't care about customer service. It's very sad that I had to experience it. New rules should be clearly posted for everyone to see not just to the employee's to see. Very disappointed and will be telling my friends about it as well. Too bad I couldn't rate you zero stars because 1 is to much."}
{"text":"Oh my god - something is wrong with the employees !!! The food is good but the staff make you feel like your not wanted - all three people I had contact with had attitudes , don't smile.   We spent 48.00 on our order and will not be back until the staff get customer service training.  A little confused why the owner can see these reviews and yet continue allowing that conduct and subjecting people to it."}
{"text":"went to pick up when I got there they never place the order then they messed up the order one time and had to redo it and then realize they still messed up the order the second time had to wait about 30 minutes and my order still wasn't even right and the lady in the front was catching an attitude at first...food was good but not worth my time if that's how they treat customers and if they can't even get it right even the second time....pathetic"}
{"text":"Worst cafe rio I have ever been too. Completely Out of all their juices and their brewed tea's didn't have lids exposing the deliciousness of that which is tea to all the environmental factors. Beans were slimy. Not a very pleasant working staff either.  The cheery on top is the airconditoning unit was broken."}
{"text":"Not great. The green sauce was way too sweet. Some how we ended up with combos tho we nevwe asked for a drink. Perhaps it was because it was the nightly special meal. Nevertheless,  portion size was decent but for bang  (taste) for the buck, I'd stick with Chinos.  Much better, authentic flavor...and my tummy would not be revolting.  Might go back to try spicy, but don't see ourselves giving it a 3rd try.  Been to Chinos over a 100 times. L9ve it every time.  Cafe Rio is new to the fancy Frys..had to try it."}
{"text":"Eh, I love & hate you CR... Right now, I hate you! Tryed your online ordering for the first time and probably the last time. When I got there I went to the p/u line. You guys didn't even have my order online? Hmmm, lady at counter said it takes 15 minutes to come up after you order? Not cool but what ever. I've been charged for it already so I'll wait. Tick * Tock * 15 minutes pass, I get up and walk back over to the lady to see if it is up, it is. Woo-who! So she said they'll start to make it. Alright, cool. Took 35 more minutes!? Oh come on now, I just got off work, all I want is my damn cheese enchiladas and my chips & guac! I know you guys get extremely busy but there was no reason for my order to take that long! Geez"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing shredded beef tacos. I love their dressing and their staff is so lovely and fun"}
{"text":"Just left this store, not busy at all. Cool so I get in line and order my salad. Asked the guy prepping the salad 3 times for house dressing. Never gave it to me. Gives it to the guy standing next to him to bag it. I ask him as well may I have house dressing. He looks at me and say, go ask the guy that made the salad. Ummmm y'all aren't busy and I did ask nicely. So ummmm manager, please train your employees to take car of paying customers"}
{"text":"Once again we visited the happy valley noterra location in Phoenix and they were out of Cajun shrimp.  If this establishment is going to offer Cajun shrimp only on Saturday one would think the management would make sure it would not happen again. This has happened for the third time now. We arrived at 6pm for dinner looking forward to Cajun shrimp only to be disappointed again.   When this was brought to the attention of the manager we were told there's nothing she can do. She said she throws pounds of coconut shrimp away every Saturday but cannot make less coconut shrimp and more Cajun shrimp because corporate will not allow it. We were not given an apology at all just an excuse along with an unpleasant attitude.   If this location is running out of Cajun shrimp before the dinner crowd arrives on the only night it is served it would probably be a good idea to change things up a bit. Apparently we are not the only ones that don't think coconut shrimp on a taco is appealing.   Disappointed for a third time. Time to try Carlos O'briens that opened up nearby."}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic Enchilada but instead found an uncooked tortilla with stuff thrown in it and sauce literally slopped on top and on the sides of the to go bowl. Was rushed through the line, not allowed to ask questions or see the food on the line, made to feel dumb when looking for the hidden silverware tray... too bad"}
{"text":"Just stopped into Cafe Rio on Sahara for the first time.   Every staff member was FRIENDLY, COURTEOUS and best of all,  GENUINELY HAPPY.   It's our first visit, they were gracious in explaining the various entrees, and explaining how fresh everything is.   Our cashier JOSE was so friendly,  he followed up with us several times.   Asked how we were enjoying our meal and explained how he makes the chips fresh every mourning at 7 am.   He had such joy and passion in his voice about the quality of his work.   It's refreshing to see employees really enjoy the work they do .  The establishment is clean and inviting.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried it one to many times... the staff is horrible... went in at 8 they do not close until 10:00 asked for grilled chicken tacos and the woman said \"no we don't have chicken\" not that they would make it or anything. Just rude people who do not care about there job. I said to them it's 8 how do you not have chicken and she said it takes 20 minutes to make so we do t have chicken I was so taken back I ended up not eating. If my toddler wasn't so hungry we would have walked. Such a shame. No matter how good the food if you have a bad staff multiple times  I won't return."}
{"text":"The service and quality of food at this location was so poor that I will never come here again. I have never been to a cafe rio that was empty at lunch time and this one was. That should be the first sign that something is wrong. I ordered the fire roasted chicken salad and the chicken was dry and burned. The girl behind the counter never asked if I wanted rice or beans. She just put the chicken on a cold and stale tortilla. When I asked for them she was rude and said she asked. With no one in front of us in line, it still took 5 minutes to get the food and checkout. I would have asked to see the manager, but no one was receptive enough to even bother trying to ask. And honestly, if his/her restaurant is empty at lunch, my guess is they don't care either. Maybe a call to corporate would help them out."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Tacos with chicken or chicken tostada salad are usually my faves. The salsa fresca is to die for, only time I've ever found any place that makes it like my dads homemade. Sometimes I go just for a pint of it to take home. Wish the service was better though."}
{"text":"I have to start with the playlist in this joint --  beyond impressed!  Every song was alternative favorite of mine; and I am hard pressed to find a place that plays literally one after another of every great alternative song that I love. But more on that in a minute....  Mexican Grill that serves up fresh Mexican fare in the form of burritos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas.  Had the Pork Barbacoa Burrito and it was excellent!  The pork is on the sweeter side, really fresh and slow cooked in a yummy savory sauce.  Love this rendition so much better than the spicy stuff they serve at Chipotle.  Actually, I would probably choose this place over Chipotle -- the food is just as fresh and has more flavor, and they don't just cake the toppings on.  The staff is awesome too!  They sing and dance and provide a convivial and friendly atmosphere for the patrons.  And did I mention the best part -- the playlist!  This place has a better playlist than most bars and restaurants I've been in -- some Weezer, Everclear, Blink 182, among others alternative favorties, and to top it off -- wait for it -- Journey's Don't Stop Believing! I'm sold on."}
{"text":"Great tasting Mexican Food better tasting then chipotle. They have a great variety, and have good prices and Taco Tuesday and etc. They make everything fresh, squeezing lemon, making tortillas, and grating cheese. They also have a great drink option, like a Mint lemonade, Horchata, and Vanilla Coke."}
{"text":"Let me just start with the Café Rio on Eastern is the best with the nicest employees.  The last two times that I have been to the Blue Diamond location I have had a horrible experience.  The first time the cashier was extremely rude to me, she was unhappy that I was paying with my Café Rio points from my catering order. That is no reason to be rude to anyone. No thank you, no nothing. This is your job, if she is so unhappy she should just quit.  The second time I stopped in I was close to this location so I decided to stop in during the lunch hour. It was a little busy but I was patient. I ordered a salad and I told the person no Pico, and I had to yell it over the glass and she was still was not listening to me because I had to say it numerous times. When she finally heard me it was too late and she he started to scoop off the Pico, then looked at me and in a very rude manner she asked \"do you want me to make you another?\" She was so rude but I said no, that's okay. She obviously did not want to. I checked out and I was so surprised that she was so rude, when it was her fault that she wasn't listening to what I wanted. She should have just made me another without asking. I headed back to the office to eat my salad, I picked the remaining tomatoes out and to my surprise I found a BUG on my lettuce.  Well I wasn't going to eat the salad now that it had a bug in it. That was the last time that I will ever go to this location. This one is close to my house, and close to my job but I am willing to drive all the way to Eastern if I want Café Rio."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Rio today around 3 and for the second time in 2 weeks they were out of shedded chicken.  Very disappointing. It seems that a restaurant should be better prepared to have all food choices available.  The line was also so SLOOOOW,  Only about 10 people in line and it took over 25 minutes to get food.  I have visited other Cafe Rio locations and never had an issue.  This site needs better management."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. I go here every other week with my step daughter and we have girls lunches. Tonight I went with my love and I have to say I was super dissatisfied.  I will give cafe rio 5 stars because overall this place is great and one bad night won't sway me.  I will be going back this weekend with my step daughter and hope that it's back on track and that tonight was just a miss. The staff tonight also seemed like they could care less about doing their jobs (a couple of the girls not the whole staff). Very disappointed. Jobs are hard to come by right now so I think a little more respect would be nice."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Was really pleased. First place I've eaten where the food actually looks better than the picture"}
{"text":"Second visit to this location. Second time we absolutely loved the food. Unfortunately, also the second time we received absolutely terrible customer service by the surly staff. Could these people be any more disenchanted with their jobs? I have never witness a collection of such rude staff. I don't care how delicious your food is. It's not worth waiting thirty plus minutes in line for, only to be rushed through the ordering process while they make mistake after mistake causing the process to take even longer...all along being treated like garbage. We won't step foot into this establishment again. I can think of a number of other places with food equally as good, and a much more friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Change the glass once and for all!!    I've been coming here for years. The busier they are the worse the customer service is. I get that the hurry and hustle is part of the \"experience\". But when you can't hear me and I can't see you or my food because the glass/pillars are in the way, it's no longer \"fun\", yet rudeness ensues on the part of their team members. Then my order is wrong and they are annoyed. It'll be awhile before I come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place again.  The place was well staffed and efficient with their line.  Everything was properly stocked."}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative I would. Wayyyyy overpriced and $1.19 for a mini scoop of guacamole, I'm talking about the scoop is soooo small that I wouldn't even be able to spread it on this fun size enchilada I received which btw is a joke for $5.99. And the cashier was extremely rude.   I see why there was no line when I walked in."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Cafe Rio while waiting on Laptop Exchange to finish a repair. It was pretty busy in there but I liked the atmosphere. Cozy, casual, and comfortable. The food was great but I can see how you have to go a few times to figure out how you want your food. Also feels a little rushed so that's why you need to know what you want before you get up there otherwise you will hold the line up. As far as price goes...it is reasonable. I will be back."}
{"text":"their service is not great  at all...completely forgot what i asked for & made my meal the way they remembered....which was wrong. i see from other reviews that this is not a first instance. probably the worst cafe rio in the city. 2 stars bc cafe  rio's food is always great in general."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, somewhat expensive. Two reasons its not a five star. All four times I have gone the trashcans have been overflowing and the other reason is the service can be rude at times."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but!..... Both times that I have been in there they have messed up our order! And there is always a crazy long line.  PS. The workers are great! Very friendly!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My favorite mexican food place to go and very reasonable pricing !!"}
{"text":"I usually go the the cafe rio on eastern and serene and this is my first time eating at this location.  I have to say it will be the last time.  I would rather drive further for better service, cleanliness, and food quality.  This location is terrible.  The staff were very rude.  They were dropping things everywhere.  The lettuce looked old and wilted.  Half of the drinks on the drink station were empty and we were there at 5:30pm.  It also looked like the they haven't cleaned the whole station for days.  I hope they either retrain their staff or hire better people."}
{"text":"Yummy food in a quaint restaurant. I had the enchiladas and a bag of chips and salsa. Everything is made in front of you and the tortillas are frshly made."}
{"text":"The amount of food is not worth the cost. AT ALL and they charge $2 for a pinch of guacamole. I'll stick to chipotle."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and this location has gone downhill since it first opened. As a teacher, this is a quick place to pickup lunch. It is terrible when the order is made incorrectly (which is more often than not) and I don't have time to go back and change it. This used to be a great location. From the incorrect orders and forgetting dressings in pick-up orders to the remnants of plastic bags found in the food and the rude employees, I'm very disappointed! Get it together!"}
{"text":"In the past chipolte was my go to spot for a quick lunch, but after discovering Cafe Rio I have changed my alliances.  This place is fantastic.  The chips & queso are outstanding and the sweet pork is out of this world.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"As I have stated in all my cafe rio reviews I really like this place for fast casual dining.  I mostly go for lunch and highly recommend the chips and queso, I can't not order it.  The sweet pork is also terrific."}
{"text":"Their burritos end up too soggy and compared to their menu what I was served didn't even come close. Workers bust their butt to ensure nobody waits too long but the quality of food is average, it's fast food quality so don't expect a food epiphany."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food! They seem like they have upped their game and the manager is great!"}
{"text":"I never post in yelp but this service was so bad I had to. I have been to dozens of Cafe Rio restaurants from Utah to california and have NEVER experienced such poor service. The staff all seemed to hate their jobs and showed no interest in taking care of the customers. The line wasn't that long but the wait was ridiculous and they all seemed bothered by having to do their jobs!! I was so frustrated that I walked out without even getting my meal! They didn't have carne asada and they weren't even attempting to make any. No guacamole, and no tomatoes!! Just pre-prepared salsa. Can't eat onions and they said they don't cut tomatoes unless they are making salsa. Every other Cafe Rio is happy to do it for me and always has. Twenty plus year customer and this is how this store runs. I hope management pays attention to this post. The manager didn't seem to care so I guess that's why the staff didn't care either! I left and went to the Happy Valley Cafe Rio where they know how to take care of customers and the manager is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give it a shot seeing as it is close to campus. Bad idea. Grease, grease, and more grease. I couldn't even stomach taking more than a couple bites. Upside: the guacamole and chips are pretty good. I'd take a pass on this location at least."}
{"text":"Very nice on the inside. I couldn't get over the portapotty smell, so unfortunately I got out of line.  I can't eat food when the restaurant stinks.  I think there is a grease trap problem.  Hope they get it fixed."}
{"text":"How disappointing. The meat in our food was cold - right out of the refrigerator cold!!  The juice dispensers were empty and flat-out dispensing spoodge and slime. The employees all acted like they needed a good nap. This is the first time I've been back to this place since they screwed up a order that we had for a party. I guess this will be the last"}
{"text":"Randomly decided to stop in yesterday afternoon...I'm so glad I did!  I ordered the pork nachos with black beans and queso..they were SO yummy.  The portions are ridiculously huge, so I took the rest home and ate it for breakfast (weird eating pork nachos for breakfast, I know).  The service was very fast and friendly and they even sang a festive little nacho song.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have never been nickeled and dimed more than I just was...   You should be able to switch out sour cream for guacamole without being charged and to be charged for extra dressing too... Forget it.  Then they forgot to add my taco to the order.  Since I needed everything on one receipt for reimbursement I asked for my receipt to be cancelled out then have the taco added.  There was no one behind me and the cashier refused!  I love Cafe Rio normally - especially the location by my house but this one... Never again!"}
{"text":"Don't go there late night they don't treat your burrito right. They give you the scraps. And I wanted horchata but of course none there. They're already kinda expensive, I at least want some horchata ."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying that I've had Cafe Rio before at other locations and have really enjoyed it.   Today, my boyfriend decided that we should pick up Cafe Rio from this new location. We live right down the street so my boyfriend suggested that we just order ahead and he would pick it up. The mobile app was easy to use. We both got steak quesadillas with extra cheese, he got extra steak and I got a side of pinto beans. I also switched out the pico for the green salsa since I had heard it was super good. We put in the order via the app and my boyfriend left to pick it up. Our food was done on time and my boyfriend returned home.   When he returned home, things quickly went south. Our \"extra cheese\" for our quesadillas was in a container on the side, so we got shredded cheese. Same thing for his extra steak, it was also just in a container and not in the quesadilla. We both thought that was really odd. We would have understood if we had gotten tacos and they put the items on the side so we could add it but we got quesadillas so it didn't make much sense.   What really made me upset was that the green salsa I ordered, was inside the now soggy quesadilla. They put everything else on the side that should have been inside the quesadilla, but the one item that was supposed to be on the side, ended up inside the quesadilla. I wasn't able to eat my food so my boyfriend packed our food up and went back out to Cafe Rio to get it re-made since it was so messed up.  When my boyfriend returned, he spoke to the manager. The manager did not apologize or seem to care that our order was completely messed up. They were a little busy at the time but the manager kept interrupting my boyfriend and kept raising his voice telling him \"just tell me what you need\". We had our food re-made the way that we wanted it made the first time and my boyfriend returned home. Honestly, if the manager would have been polite and apologized for the mistake, this would have been a 5 star review of how they corrected their mistake and we got delicious food. This interaction has put a sour taste in my mouth and we will not be returning to this location. We will drive out of our way to go to the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"Steak salads for me and the wife and as usual, tasty and quick.  Always consistent service and food quality.  Heard they have another location on the east side which we will be checking out too."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Rio to get a salad to go (as I often do). When I got home, I discovered they forgot to put the dressing in the bag. I called and spoke to Chris, the General Manager, and he said he would have someone deliver the dressing. About 40 minutes passed, and no dressing. I called the store and spoke to him again, and he apologized and said the first driver got lost and that he sent another driver out with a large container of dressing. About 5 minutes later that driver arrived with the dressing. I was happy to eat my delicious salad. Then about 10 minutes later my doorbell rang again, and it was Chris himself with a fresh salad and free meal cards for me. He wanted to make sure I was taken care of and he was very apologetic about the mistake. This was above and beyond the call of duty! I applaude Chris and Cafe Rio for ensuring the customer is happy. I have never experienced customer service like that in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"As I was standing in line, the lady in front of me had ordered two meals. One of which they had run out of meat and had to begin cooking more. The employee literally asked \"well what do you want?\" The customer ahead of myself replied that she would wait for more and did so politely. The employee, with a smug look, then came to me and took my order. Soon after, she began speaking Spanish to the other employees laughing hysterically. Discouraged, I reluctantly asked for an order of queso and chips. The employee rolled her eyes, threw it in the bag and gave us our food.  Once I was home I called the store to file a complaint and was immediately dismissed with the reply, \"K ill talk to the girls, have a good night.\" I love cafe rio but this experience has stained the way I feel about this particular establishment."}
{"text":"Don't order online or call in group orders. ..they seem to lose track of their online orders and they never have group orders ready before you show up to pau, even with a given pick up time. This is the 3rd, maybe 4th, time this has happened to us for our work lunches. Shame on them now..."}
{"text":"I'm personally a big fan of Cafe Rio love their food. But this specific Cafe Rio always gets my order wrong. My wife and I are vegan and we just ask for no dairy and no meat. I come to this place frequently since it's a 5 minute drive from my apartment and I always order the same thing but they always get my order wrong. Something is always missing and when I tell them the problem they take FOREVER in fixing it. I've had to wait 45 min for them to fix a burrito which is pretty ridiculous. If this didn't happen so often I would rate it higher but it just happens way to often."}
{"text":"Forget the line to get your food just look at the cleanliness. If the dining area turns you off walk up to the counter and see the kitchen. We used to go here at least once a week. Been back a few times thinking it would get better but it has not. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good burritos.  Though they say the Barbacoa is award winning, it is too sweet for my taste.  I love the salads (they are very large) but whatever they put on the lettuce can affect my digestive tract.  I usually go for the chicken burrito and my wife always gets a salad."}
{"text":"This place is terrible they charge for things that are common place among mexican foods like cheese and dont even inform you until you at the register paying then get an attitude when you ask them to explain your charges and throw your change in your hand. I have been to other cafe rio's & may still but this particular restaurant at 9594 s eastern does not deserve the business if their employees are going to act like this...Chipotle here i come"}
{"text":"I like this location generally.  The staff is friendly.  Food is good.  Although the last time I had a coworker pickup my order of Chile roast beef salad,  and there was no salad in it wth. It was kinda like a  burrito bowl instead and I was charged for the salad bowl. My Co worker even ask if this was a salad since it did not look right. They confirmed that it was a salad.  So I don't know who made my salad last time. But salads have green leaves in it lol."}
{"text":"This is the worst cafe Rio location ever. Frantic workers, empty drink fountains,  dirty tables,no forks,and overflowing trash cans. I hate this place."}
{"text":"When I first moved here in 2010 after moving in me and the wife were hungry and felt like Mexican and looked up places and cafe Rio was closest so we went and tried the burritos I thought it was very tastey. All the way till now I still love it the pork is the best soooooo good."}
{"text":"not quite what I ordered.. I ordered hot sauce got mild, wanted shredded chicken, got grilled chicken, put no pico, it came with pico"}
{"text":"I've tried to be hopeful with this place but every single time I find myself very disappointed. From the sub par service to the mediocre food. After today, I will not be going back. Reason being is, I had brought a friend of mine from back east to try it out. We finished eating and walked out to the car. I realized I had forgotten my cell phone on the table (roughly 2-3 minutes) so I went back in to get it. It wasn't on the table so I asked a few employees and eventually one of them had my phone in her apron. I was relieved and walked back out to my car. Once I got out to my car I noticed that my cell phone had been powered off. Hmmmm, interesting right? Why would someone power off a customer's cell phone within 2-3 minutes of it being left behind?? Because they had ill will intentions of stealing it! Common sense is if someone loses their phone and can't find it, one of the first things they do is CALL IT in hopes of someone with integrity will answer and give it back to it's rightful owner. So powering the phone off would make that nearly impossible. Of course, I went back inside and asked one of the employees what the girl's name was. The employee responded \"I don't know\". Really? You don't know who you work with? So, I then ask another employee, which happened to be the manager and she told me that her name was EMILY. Never did the manager ask what my concern was. I confronted Emily and asked her why she powered off my cell phone in such a short period of time of finding it and kept it in her apron instead of handing it over to her supervisor. She was speechless. I told her, you wouldn't have powered off my cell phone if you didn't have intentions of keeping it, right?  She then responded \"I have my own cell phone, I don't need yours. I turned it off so it wouldn't bother anyone if it rang\". Yeah, okay. The manager then came over and I explained to her what had happened and she seemed stunned and agreed that EMILY shouldn't have done that. What happened after that and if Emily was held accountable, I don't know. I had to leave for a meeting.  However, I did call the corporate office but, unfortunately, they are closed on Sunday. I will try again on Monday."}
{"text":"Customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. I ordered online and was told it would be ready in 45 mins. I get there 45 mins later only to find my order hasn't even been looked at. So I have to wait another 20 mins to get my food which was all wrong anyway. I paid for side orders and didn't get them either. They didn't even care. I'll never go back and I'll take great delight in telling others not to go either."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cafe Rio for a couple of years now and have never been dissapointed. I typically get the Pork Barbacoa burrito and have to say that is the best burrito of that style I have ever had. The price is a little on the high end for a burrito, but you won't have to eat for the rest of the day, the burritos are that big. The staff is friendly and the food is fresh. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I'm not a big pork fan but the pork here is sweet and tasty so much so that I've never even tried their other meats. The staff is always happy and the place is super cute and clean. I also love that they have specialty foutain drinks, the mojito one is bomb"}
{"text":"This place always disappoints me 2 hours before close and they are always out of meats and corn tortillas i come here 2 or 3 times a week walk in and they are always out you think they would know that there is a demand for things and to maybe make a little more"}
{"text":"Just another prime example as to why I continue to rate this place very low as they do not close for two hours and they are already completely out of certain items and every time I come in and ask for either grilled chicken or corn tortillas they tell me sorry we're all out I hate coming to this place but unfortunately it's the closest one to my gym I have to go drive out of my way in order to get what I am craving from a different Cafe Rio"}
{"text":"Horrible service!This place need to be close from Health department!This is the most dirty location ever!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the cafe rio brand and proximity to my house, I would avoid this cafe rio. It has the typical cafe rio food, which is good, but has some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. When you walk in, be prepared to deal with cashiers texting and employees making every request seem like a bother.   Also, don't even bother to order online. I have now tried to do so FIVE times and it has never been ready at the time they told me. They never even begin making your meal until you go to the counter and complain. Then, expect your order to be wrong or poorly put together because they'll be in such hurry and apparently could care less about your meal.   Do yourself a favor and go to any other cafe rio."}
{"text":"Pretty good for vegas!  They actually get their spices from a place in Texas, so there food is as close to Tex-Mex as I've had out here.  The pinto beans are excellent!  My only complaint is that the food is always very salty.  They have great meat though and good sauces.  Definetely worth trying!"}
{"text":"The food here is usually good, but the customer service is horrible! We placed an order through the app ahead of time. Paid for extra steak on the salads. When my husband got there 20mins later, they told him it would be a 45min wait for an order placed ahead 20 mins prior!! It would be quicker to go through the line. On top of that they messed up both salads. Instead of grilled chicken with the extra grilled steak we paid $3.00 for on each salad, they gave us shredded chicken on each salad. The shredded chicken does not taste good on a salad at all.  When my husband returned home and I realized the order was wrong I tried calling them. The guy that answered the phone listened to what was wrong and then said sorry and hung up on me. When I called back as soon as he realized it was me he put me on hold and never picked up the phone again. I am a very patient person when it comes to getting an order wrong. I always speak calmly and just ask nicely for it to be fixed, so being treated like this was appalling! I will never return to this location because of it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my experience here today. It was our first visit to this location and we won't be back. They were out of large tortillas and had no chips made and no cheddar cheese. Nearly every container was empty, except rice, black beans, jack cheese, sour cream and lettuce. The guacamole looked horrible! The container on the counter was empty, so the employee pulled a \"fresh\" container out of the refrigerator. The sides and top of the guac were brown/black....but he proceeded to toss some salsa on top of it and mix it up! Needless to say I passed on the guac!   The counters were filthy....with food all over the place, and none of the employees seemed to care. The owner needs to take a serious interest in quality control, or you'll have no business. I'll happily drive to Queen Creek to go to Costa Vida or the Cafe Rio at the Marketplace! Please take some notes on how they run their business and the pride they take in the cleanliness of their establishment."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, but the service has gone downhill. Employees are rude, don't know how to smile and are clearly unmotivated to be at work. Once you have your food the experience gets a lot better. I order a shredded chicken burrito enchilada style and it is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Long line but it went by pretty fast. Lots of workers making sure everyone gets their food fast."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. So excited this new location opened up. Thanks for the double points through the Cafe Rio app."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! I accidentally ordered the wrong dressing online and the cashier promptly made me a new one and educated me on the difference"}
{"text":"Not so great. I had higher expectations for this place. The food is overpriced, a burrito for almost $10! Their menu is a bit misleading, saying a burrito comes enchilada style, but then they charge you an extra dollar for it. Not very friendly to newcomers either. You have to know exactly what you want and if you ask them to repeat what they asked you, they scream louder instead of enunciating more clearly. I will give them that their portions were large and their queso is very good, but overall it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This place is okay. It didn't wow me or anything. Just a pretty run-in-the-mill place in my opinion. It was way too crowded for my liking. I stood in line for about 5 minutes before I even got to order my food. They give you a bowl 2-3 times the size of chipotle but instead of filling it with rice, beans, meat, and the salad items, they skimp on the rice and beans and pound it with lettuce. The shredded chicken was good but nothing special. Honestly this place is okay but it's not a must try or anything."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant. Amazing salads, amazing enchilada style burritos. The tres leches is fantastic. Chips and queso is the best. Fancy fun drinks. Perfect score perfect place."}
{"text":"used to love cafe rio. tonight we ordered take out and it was completely wrong. terrible quality control. my salad had no guac, no pico, but too much lettuce. hardly any meat or beans or rice. meat was all fat. extremely disappointed that my favorite place has gotten this bad!! do not order online because it will come out wrong. seems like they do not care about the food they are putting out. everything still tasted fine. just TERRIBLE quality control. this location needs some major help in terms of their employees."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Its better than Baja fresh.  Reasonable prices deals everyday.  Kid friendly, big portions, fresh tortillas and nice people"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever had, anywhere. I spent more time in line than actually eating. Everyone behind the counter was extremely rude, short, and clearly upset about something. Food was mediocre at best and it's a shame, because I actually really like Cafe Rio. Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"The fresh made tortillas are amazing. Best Mexican counter service place we have tried."}
{"text":"I would frequent Cafe Rio if for no other reason, just for its hand pressed Mint limeaid!  It's like an amazing virgin mojito on tap! Of course it's taste varies by location and even day by day but I love love love it!   They have other nice beverage choices but that's the one for me!! Aside from the delicious drinks, I actually really like this place. Similar in layout to a Chipotle type restaurant, you have your choice of dishes and then go down the bar picking out your meats and toppings. I find Cafe Rio to have a more diverse array of dish options than Chipotle so if you want more choices, you might like it. The portions are quite large and the tortillas are made in house. I didn't give it a higher rating for several reasons. First, the wood fired chicken I got- which admittedly was from the bottom of the tub- was exceeding dry. Next, my guacamole was mostly lettuce- weird.  All of the trash cans were overflowing so bad that we couldn't even cram our plates in them. And the women's restroom needed MAJOR attention, the very least of which was the need to pick up no less than 5 empty toilet paper rolls, and other various and sundry trash on the floor.  Meh- maybe the take away is that they were paying more attention to the food than the trash and toilets.....Maybe!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Cafe Rio, but not this particular location. They are way too slow and frequently run out of items. I had hoped in time they would improve, but I haven't seen it so far."}
{"text":"We've recently moved to this area and had been going to the centennial cafe rio since it opened. The staff is just plain rude. They have thrown pens at us to sign receipts. They come off as lazy. They don't fill up the soup or dressing and the tomato in the pico is so large it seems like they couldn't be bothered to cut it up properly. The shredded chicken this last time was almost not even like chicken, probably because it wasn't cooked all the way. The food quality is poor and the staff is rude. Save yourself and just make the drive out to the centennial area."}
{"text":"Food: The food is obviously not authentic, even Chipotle taste a lot better than this. I find the food extra salty, other people say it's fine, so be warned.   Pick up: Ordering pick up sucks. They make it as you come, not the pick up time. It took them 10 mins to make it. It beats waiting in line, but defeats the purpose of pick up.  Overall, I would not recommend this place. I'd rather eat at Roberto's"}
{"text":"Every time I try to call in an order I either get hung up on or put on hold and the call doesn't get picked back up. The employees are rude, like you're wasting their time. I wish my boyfriend didn't love their salads so much or I would NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Cafe Rio in Queen Creek. Loud, crowded....felt like you are rushed thru and you can't even hear what they're asking...very confusing. I'm giving them 1 star becuz they don't have corn tortillas that are gluten, flour free! And they were out of them. They had processed corn tostada shells...for a fast food restaurant that proclaims fresh and homemade you'd think they could have fresh corn tortillas made with corn. I will never eat there again...very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very surprised to see such mediocre reviews because this place is awesome.  Yes, sometimes the line is long, depends on if you go there during peak times.  But the long line is simply testament to the great food.  If you have never been to Cafe Rio, it is similar to Chipotle, but better tasting food, better drinks."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, but this location smells so bad, I can't stomach my food. This is not first time I've had to leave because of smell - the pop machine, especially. I highly suggest heading to the Eastern location. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I heart this place!  Want freshly soft flour tortillas? This is the place! Try their grilled chicken salad with their house dressing! To die for! Salad is laid into a cheesy giant soft tortilla shell...sooooo good!  Let me tell you their chicken soup is the yummiest ever! Big chunks of shredded chicken breast...tasty...perfect and hits the spot on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Salads are big, the tortilla soup is one of the best you can find around town. Fresh made tortillas are dangerously good."}
{"text":"I love their tortillas!!!! They are delicious! The sweet pork enchilada style is very good as well!  Kids love the cheese enchiladas.   I've had only one incident were O ordered ahead and they ran out of what I orders so I had to get something else, but I guess it's a good sign that they are always busy!"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork salad;  also like there enchiladas and burritos. Good place for lunch, but sometimes the line can get a little long. Not exactly fast food. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Rio for the first time for Taco Tuesday and I was very impressed.  We tried both the Chicken and Sweet Pork tacos and both were fantastic.  I thought the chicken was a little better, but both were great and the homemade tortillas were very good.  Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Great staff, Robert is wonderful. They have changed for the better. Once in a while there's a slip up but all in all it's a go to for a quick, reasonable meal before or after a movie.  Try the chocolate covered strawberry shake, it's muy favorite."}
{"text":"This is a very well run fast food restaurant. The staff is always friendly, efficient, and accurate. The customer service is top notch and the food quality is always excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this place again last night.  Food is still fantastic.  Service is still really bad - tons of personal conversations among workers, and worker tried to take my order when there were still several people in front of her.  I'm not going to shout my order at you; wait until I get there.   Cashier was irritated that I didn't know what kind of sauce husband had on his food.  Really?  If that info is important to have, perhaps someone should be punching in an order at the front of the line?  I told several staff that our food was 'to go'. A worker put a lid on one item and walked off.  Cashier was holding the bag and kept staring at me so after waaay too long I said, 'that's OK, I got this' and took a lid from the stack and put it on the container myself.  Like I said, the food is fantastic but the experience and service are anything but."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a fan.  It's obviously not authentic Mexican, but in my opinion, a better option than Chipotle.  I like that they make giant flour tortillas on-site.  They taste so good, I usually push my salad around to get to the tortilla.  Actually, that may be the linchpin for me.  I usually have the chicken salad, which is ginormous.  Overall, it's good and I like their creamy cilantro dressing.  It has just a little kick but is not so spicy that it's uncomfortable for me to eat.  (Disclaimer: I'm a self-admitted salsa/spicy wimp.)  I also like that they have hibiscus iced tea (i.e., jamaica)."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is amazing  But this location blows. We both got salads and they didn't put the melted cheese on the tortilla. When we asked about it they said \"they don't do that\". Hm. Well next time we'll just go to the locations by our house who \"do that\".  Basically, if your craving cafe rio, don't go to this one."}
{"text":"Almost $8 for a simple plain beans and rice (vegan) burrito?  I must be out of my mind.  I went this one time (with a group of friends) but never again.  I HATE places that charge the same price for \"hold the meat & cheese\" items. At least at Chipolte the vegetarian meal is priced less and you get peppers with the burrito.  Not here.   Black beans and rice with sauce.  Oh and lettuce.  VERY hard to tell which exact customer's order the server is working on.  I had to have them remake my burrito because they AUTOMATICALLY threw cheese on it without thinking.    Add another restaurant to my \"failed the vegan\" test."}
{"text":"I prefer Cafe Rio over Chipotle, Qudoba, etc. I feel like the quality of the food has gone down a little bit from about a year ago. I frequest this location about once a week with my daughter for a little ladies lunch outting. My Daughter loves the Kids quesadilla. I generally order a salad. What sells me the most is they have both Coke Zero and Diet Dr. Pepper. I have a small addiction to soda and they have both types I enjoy, LOL."}
{"text":"this place surprised me. I had tried it once a while back and ordered the wrong thing. I just ordered the grilled steak burrito with spicy sauce - very tasty and good. Salads are very good as well. stay away from the sweet meats and sauces (too sugary) and not savory. for some reason many places are going with these ultra sweet sauces and sweet marinated meats."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again, I ordered online so that I could avoid the line, I get there and the order is not ready, says its going to be 15 min, I agree to it, 25 min go by and I asked if it was gonna take any longer...they had not even started on my order. I do not mind being patient and understand if its busy, but lying to my face about taking care of my order in a timely manner and not doing anything is just bad."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good, but this past week my colleagues and I phoned in an order for a meeting we were having during lunch. We requested to have it ready at 12:45 (called in at 11:05) and they said that was okay and when we get there our food had been made and sitting there for over an hour. We did not even get everything we ordered and it was all cold and soggy. I wouldn't have given 3 stars if the manager hadn't apologized and offered us replacement meals when we called back that day. I understand that it was busy and lunchtime but for calling in that far in advance we had hoped that would give them ample time to have our order correct and still somewhat warm."}
{"text":"Small Portions, Overpriced, Horrible Service.  Rice was dry and hard, beans were dry and flavorless! Food was not good at all!"}
{"text":"The food was on point but like others have said below, the problem is the staff, management and organization.    Here's what happened to us last night:  We placed an order online and were quoted 7:00 pm as our pick up time.   We ordered online because we always end up taking half of our food home with us and because we have two boys ages 2 and 4 so timing is crucial and waiting is a disaster.   Got there at 7:05 pm exactly and told the To Go cashier that we are here and asked if it would be more than 5 minutes because if so, I would have my husband take the kids for a little walk.  She says: I'm sending your order to the front of the line right now and it will be ready in roughly 5 min. I say: perfect.  Little did I know that we would not receive our order until 7:35 pm due to some communication problems between the new to go cashier and the guy that preps the food and helps with to go orders. I have no idea what the real problem was because I was too busy trying to help my husband keep our kids mellow while waiting 30 minutes in a crowded restaurant with no food.   It would have been much faster if I had waited in the line and ordered in person.  The worst part was that I went back to the to go area to see what was going on multiple times and was consistently given the message that it was right there and would be right up.   The food was below the standard and made with so much sour cream it was ridiculous but I guess we were able to choke it down because its hard to find anything wrong with Cafe Rio's sweet pork.   I didn't yell or even have a chance to express my frustration because as I'm sure you can imagine, the kids required most of our attention and honestly I didn't see anyone that looked over the age of 18 working at that time so I didn't think that would really make me feel any better.  Obviously the management is the problem bc the whole to go ordering process is a train wreck.   Here's my hope:   A) Cafe Rio-- GET BETTER  B) Notice the trend in recent POOR reviews and take action by contacting each person and inviting them back for a more enjoyable experience on the house C) Don't make my family stop eating the most delish sweet pork in the world because your service sucks.  D) GET BETTER   Gracias."}
{"text":"Great food,  Terrible service. Last couple times I've been here have been terrible. My friend and I ordered burritos, not enchilada, and the guy making them was moving at his own pace and made them enchilada style anywah. Next experience,  Ordered online, get here, and it's not even ready. I might as well have come in and ordered in the line myself.  She told me that they were just starting my order and I ordered online an hour and a half ago. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cafe Rio for years,but this was my first time on this location-and probably the last one. I always have the Tostada and the portion is huge and satisfying. This time the size was the half of what I'm used to. I brought it to their attention, and the answer I got was \"we do it this way here\". Well...if you are operating a franchise, every aspect of the business should be the same at every location. I am very disappointed! I left hungry, and my friend,who came with me for the first time,will never return. Shame on You!"}
{"text":"Ok been to better spots of there's but still one of the best cafes too get a great quick bite"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Im never going back. Quality has gone downhill. Employees dont give a crap. Disguisting bathrooms. Wrong orders.   This place will go out of business the way it is being ran. Lost our business for good!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of cafe rio for a few years now.  I use to be from the Los Angeles area and when I come to vegas to visit friends, I would stop by for a quick bite to eat at Cafe Rio.  My usual location is the one on eastern and the 215.  Now that I live here I was running errands today and decided to stop by because I was near this location.  HORRIBLE IDEA.    #1.  They screw you on portion at this one.  All i had in my burrito was rice and beans and a smidge of meat.  I asked for some extra hot sauce on top since I like spicy food and the person making the dish gave me a dirty look.  I had to ask three times for extra salsa.  #2.  The cashier was unfriendly and didnt care about her job at all.  I came back to order a dessert since my under normal portion burrito was nowhere near satisfying and instead of helping me, all she did was talk to her coworkers about personal matters.  I ordered the tres leches cake and she said \"they are making it fresh right now itll be just a few minutes\"  mind you those exact words so i figure hey that has to be good.  I pay for my dessert and wait about 10 minutes before I go back to the register to see if my dessert is ready.  This time I get to the register the same cashier sees me and ignores me again.  Then her coworkers just cut in front of me and start ordering their lunch and talking to her.  At this point im pretty irritated and just want her attention to tell her forget about my order and give me a refund.  That took another 6-8 minutes of standing there.  I finally get her attention and she just says simply \"oh i forgot about it\".  Continues to talk to her coworkers then after a minute goes and gets the cake.    Remember the part i said she said it was fresh?  WRONG.  she comes out with a piece of cake heavily wrapped in plastic wrap and i keep telling her cancel and refund me.  she ignores (not doesn't hear.  she heard me loud and clear) and continues to prep the cake.  at this point the next cashier comes in and i tell her LOOK I DONT WANT THE CAKE ANYMORE JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.  cashier takes my credit card and swipes the refund.  no apologies or anything from either the first cashier or second.  I've never had a experience like this at cafe rio, and this will definitely be my last.   The cake that she made they were able to sell to the next customer after me and i looked at it.  I don't claim to know everything about \"mexican\" food and i know cafe rio is a far cry from authentic, but I do know that tres leches should be a moist/wet cake.  Every time I've been to a friends family party (who are hispanic). The tres leches cake is exactly THAT.  This cake looks as dry as can be to where its comparable to angel food cake thats been sitting out for a few days.  To help hide that fact a mountain of whip cream is sprayed on top.    If anyone is actually a regular i suggest going to another store.  this is my first and last time at this store."}
{"text":"The workers here are so slow paced. It took them FOREVER to do someone's order and to get to us. There was barely anyone in line and it wasn't even busy!!!  Not to mention their pans where they had the beans looked like they hadn't been changed out in hours!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere. I'm from California so it kind of reminded me of Chipotle but waaaayyy better. Would definitely recommend to someone visiting out of the area."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a weekday night with some friends. We had a large group, but even so, the wait was already quite long.  Going through the line, three different employees had to ask which order was mine. It just seemed disorganized. The employee who handled most of my order clearly did not know the menu and did not include most of what was supposed to be included with the item. I had to go back to the register twice to ask for missing items. However, when we asked for extra salsa, they kindly gave it to us at no extra charge.  The place was clean and stocked when I was there. There is plenty of space to eat, both inside and outside. The atmosphere was pleasant. It is in a not-so-great area of town, but we are all university students, so the location is great for us.  The food was very good. Their recipes for their meat are amazing! Most of the people I was with ordered some form of the barbacoa meat, which we all loved.  Overall, I liked this place and would return."}
{"text":"I ordered online, came into pay, the girl took my money and then turned around and did something else. I waited for about 5 minutes and had to ask her what was going on with my order. She said it was being made and another few minutes before I got my food. What's the point of ordering online when the food isn't ready when you get there? Also, employees need communication training. I might not go back."}
{"text":"Her Name Is Rio And She Dances On The Sand By The Rue  Ate at Cafe Rio in Gilbert, I didn't go with the cartoon Dilbert, The food didn't make me squirt, Across the street is a Filibert (o's).  Chicken burrito enchilada style,  Stood in line but not for a while, The food was good it made me smile, After I give you my number go ahead and dial.  Seven fifty is a fair price,  The burritos are huge and come with rice, Add some beans, salsa for spice, When I'm in Vegas I throw the dice.  Buck sixty five for a small drink, Starred at the hottie but she didn't wink, Reading her magazine it made me think, Looking good in those sweats that said \"Pink\".  If you have a warrant for your arrest, Stearing clear of here would be best, Lots of cops in bullet proof vests, Lunching with their mistress is my guess.   This place gets a good crowd of hot little honey's, Probably only like you for your money, Secretly they work at the strip club called Sonny's, Wishing they were a Playboy Bunny.   Gilbert and Baseline is where it's at, Stop by here if you wanna get fat, A lot of food, Sigma Nu is a frat, I did it like that, I did it with a wiffle ball bat.  DOUBLE MEAT!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night, so it's understandable that they were very busy. However after waiting 30 minutes in line, it's also understandable I might be a bit \"hangry\" when they skip over me in line to take someone else's order. Once I ordered my steak quesadilla, I watched them literally throw a tortilla on the grill from about three feet away, then shove some cheese and steak on it and messily leave it there to melt. During this time, I watched a worker spill a customers chips on the counter and then put them back in the bowl. As customers behind me pile in front of me to pay, I watch their enchilada have salsa and sour cream thrown on it, not at all gently or neatly. My quesadilla and drink came out to about $13 which I thought was a steep price, until I realized it included sour cream and guacamole, which cost 60 cents and $2 otherwise. It made me angry when I saw the tiny ice cream scooper they use to put guac and sour cream on, definitely not worth $2.60 extra. (Not to mention Chipotle charges $1.80 for guac which they are MUCH more generous with, and sour cream is free. Also their quesadilla is much cheaper.) Needless to say, I was not impressed with their service. They were sloppy and rushed, and not very friendly other than the cashier--whom I actually felt very bad for since the situation wasn't her fault but she did recognize my frustration. Their one redeeming quality was the food actually tasted good, however later in the day it did not settle with me at all (which may just be my personal reaction to it). I don't think I'll be returning due to this experience."}
{"text":"Always great!!!!! Yummy!!! Never had anything we did not like.  Join the card savings and get one free after you buy 10."}
{"text":"love it here, the staff is good (everyone has their bad days) but overall i think this is the best mexican joint around, have tons of options. Of course there is stuff worse than other places, but overall i think this is the best place.  I always get half chicken half pork burrito with the white shredded cheese and the spicy salsa enchilada style....hell yeah!!!!  and sometimes a side of queso n chips :-O"}
{"text":"love the food, but ill be darned if i ever go back to this location....the cashier was a HUGE F'n bee eye tee see H  unbelievable actually... story is too long and makes my blood pressure rise too much to even type, but ill try!...just quick gist, we had 2 \"free meal\" stamp cards, and she was super rude never acknowledged us at the counter didnt ask us ANYTHING or say ANYTHING to us, started ringing things up, we had a burrito with extra meat and chips n queso and it came up to $15.98 then she rings up the other burrito which is chicken with sour cream....jumps to $25.XX, and i say to her that cant be right can it? she says with a snarl, im not done yet i didnt apply your free meals......well no sh8t lady i know that obviously, but how can it be $26 almost for 3 items????? she didnt bother explaining other than 'well when you get sour cream its extra, and extra meat is extra\" and i responded ok sour cream is .50c and meat is maybe $2 at the most right? soooooo.....? and she just huffed and went back to typing on the register, and next thing i know it came to $7.78.....then she throws 2 cups at us and we are like what are these for we didnt buy drinks?  \"THE BURRITOS COME WITH DRINKS\"  ohhhhh realllyyyyyyyyyy? everytime ive eaten here ive never been offered a drink in the sense of it 'coming with the burrito'  so i politely asked if i could have a bottle of water instead and pay the difference if there was one.....\"NO IT IS FOR FOUNTAIN ONLY\" i said i dont drink soda so here you can have the cup back \"WELL THERE IS JUICE\" well i dont drink juice either you stupid lasjdfjlkajsdlkfjalksfdj!!!!!!!  this place is great UP UNTIL the cashier....i think her name was fohzee or something, she will be a bigger woman with no smile and all attitude working (hopefully not much longer) the register....amazing she is still there since ive read a few reviews about poor cashier service, it has to be her....HAS TO BE.  i love cafe rio, but this location stay far far away from."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat.  Be sure to order the cilantro house dressing and put it on whatever it is you order.  I prefer the pork over the chicken or steak.  If you order the tostada with a soft tortilla you will get the perfect size version of a cafe Rio salad for a much smaller price point.  The regular size salads are huge!  My kids live this place too."}
{"text":"This place tends to get crowded at times. That is because they serve good food. Duh! I love their pork barbacoa. :) must try it. :)"}
{"text":"This location is ok... they take way longer than other locals. Pork barbacoa is still super bomb though. My fave restaurant to get burritos and quesadillas at! The tortilla soup is good too! And the chips and queso"}
{"text":"Nice place, staff was friendly and worked hard to keep up with the dinner rush. Food was cold by the time we sat down to eat it. A bit pricey too.  I got the salad with the Chile Roasted Beef; flavor was okay but no spice to it at all which was disappointing. Served with beans, rice, pico, lettuce and about a table spoon of guacamole. They charge extra for the sour cream if you want it which I thought was ridiculous. Lettuce is not shredded and the leaves are the size of your face! Just makes it messy and hard to eat.  As for the tortillas, they do make them fresh but they're severely over cooked and I don't know how long mine sat in the tin before it was served to me.  A flour tortilla should not crunch like a cracker.  Might be helpful if they rolled them out better because they're really thick which could be part of the reason they harden so much. They do however have a nice selection of fountain drinks and not just soda pop. Horchata, Mint Limeade, and a Jamaica drink are what caught my attention and those were really tasty!  I'll go back for a cool drink before stopping in to catch a meal again."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Just took the family here to try it out.  Ordered the steak burrito and fish tacos.  The burrito was overwhelmed with the flavor from the sauce.  The fish had bones in it.  The rice was crunchy from being undercooked.  Was not very happy with this meal.  Total price, with one soda, was ~$24.  We will not eat here again.  Chipotle is better."}
{"text":"Pros:  good food, frequent/reward card/daily specials  Cons:  sometimes I find the employees less than friendly -- mainly the females - and speak poor English...never overly friendly, that's for sure.  There always seems to be a couple of extra employees just standing around at the cash register area -- weird!  I hate to say it, but the female employees are the worst - I've never had one of the males be rude, indifferent or have the \"whatever\" attitude.  The women's bathroom was \"closed\" the last time I've been at this restaurant - I believe it was Jan. 16 and 4 times during the past month - either they are too lazy to clean it or there is a problem...either way, clean the men's restroom - more than once/day...another reader below said they were there on 1/20 and the women's restroom was out of order, too...  Been there when they have been out of knives or when the fountain machine was broken...how do you run out of knives at 4:30 pm and not be able to get more in for the evening dinner rush???  They place all their utensils with handles down, so you get to touch all the utensils while you take one for yourself - gross!   This can't be health code!  Tonight I was in the restaurant and the girl was restocking - she didn't have gloves on - and was  grabbing a bunch of the utensils at once (not by the handles) and sticking them in the box...handle down...C'mon management - fix this!    Also, they keep the cups right by the pay area/register - feel free to sneeze all over them.   LOL!  They should really keep their cups away from the register and the people moving through checking out...    Prefer the other locations - cleaner and friendlier employees."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for restaurants but I want to warn everyone about this place. I am a food service manager and I watch every one that makes my food insane open kitchen because hand washing is super important when handling food. I have never visited a place with so many health violations.  To start things off one guy coughed in his left glove. I looked at my husband and he saw the same thing and our eyes got really big. We couldn't believe that he just did that and didn't change his gloves. I was so hungry that I let it slide. He had zero contact with my food so it made me feel a little better. Still it was disgusting. We sat down to eat and half way through our meal we started watching everyone on the line. I saw a girl in the corner by the chips putting a chip in her mouth WITH GLOVES ON!!! and didn't wash her hands and get new gloves. This is a big health violation! My husband and I continued to watch her and she did it again!!!! The same employee went to the dining room, got a drink (WITH HER GLOVE ON STILL) took a drink and I saw her lips touch her glove and went back to the kitchen and continued working (WITH THE SAME GLOVES ON). This is worse then going to the bathroom and not washing your hands. The same employee wiped her hair out of her face withe the same gloves as before and continued working.  Lastly the person taking a phone order with her glove on returned to the line and continued working without washing her hand and changing glove.  I am in shock that the health department hasn't seen any of these violations before.  Even though they had great attitudes we will never return to this location.  It's unbelievable how the manager on duty wasn't watching this."}
{"text":"The food is great, the restaurant is clean, and the staff is usually friendly. My big complaint is the wait time to get through the line. If there are a few people in front of me, it can take quite a while to get to me and even begin my order. The process and staff just aren't too efficient. At times it seems they move slow on purpose. My orders are usually made correctly but if they aren't, the staff is quick to correct the issue. Lately my quesadillas have been very soggy as if they don't give the meat a second to drain the juice."}
{"text":"This was the first cafe rio I went to last year. It was because of this location that got me hooked on their food.   Ordering online is sooo easy, you can choose the most specific requests to make and I have gotten through with little to no issues (over 20 times ordering online, only 1 or 2 small things (left off guacamole on salad, wrong dressing) but given the law of averages they are pretty darn good.  Taste wise the salads are awesome and the reason I order from here at least once a week. Everything tastes so fresh, especially the tortilla under the salad. They make the tortillas at the location which makes a great addition to the salad. *they just added a wheat tortilla option which I tried and was sooo good.   Portion sizes are pretty large and unless I'm starving ill get 2 meals out of 1 salad."}
{"text":"We get take out from here a couple times a month. Usually get the salads, with chicken. Always comes out good, little variation. 2 dressings to choose from and different proteins. Plenty of food, good portions in a homemade tortilla underneath which is so good. They also have different specials for the day of the week. Tuesday is my fav with the coconut shrimp tacos, yum.   Staff was friendly and accomodating for each individuals preferences for toppings. Usually order online first and pick up to make it quicker, however this time I went to order online at about 8:45 and it said pick up time was 9:45. Didn't feel like waiting that long so we just went over there and there was no line, so it didn't really matter, just curious why the online time was approx 1 hour later (usually seems about 1/2 hour) maybe the time of day?  Never had any issues, and I love their salads and will continue to go back for them, and those daily specials."}
{"text":"Don't like this location! Rude staff and they are always out of everything! I feel like Cafe Rio used to be great but now they use cheap ingredients and don't take the time to make it right. My mom actually just took back her salad- which is not like her- because it was so sloppy...sadness! Miss the old way cafe rio was!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is always my go-to Mexican food place for quick and wonderful food.  And they have the best KIDS special around.  Actually, you get a FREE kids quesadilla for all kids under 6 years old with an adult purchase.  Today I went with chicken enchiladas with MEDIUM sauce.   Lunch time on a Saturday meant very long lines but it moves pretty fast.  I give Cafe Rio the 5th star because of their drink options.  In addition to the soda machine, they offer 3 types of freshly-brewed iced tea and 4 types of Mexican-flavored drinks (orchata, mint lemonade, etc.).  The fire-grilled chicken and carne asada are both great.  I haven't tried the barbacoa - but it's their most popular meat item I think.    All in all, Cafe Rio offers up quality made-to-order food - did I say HOMEMADE tortillas made in front of you?   There are very few Mexican restaurants in town that offer the same quality of food for the price.  My family of 3 can eat here for $20 or less - which is actually very hard to do in this town at any restaurant.  And the food always meets our expectations!!"}
{"text":"I will always come back here, it's one of my favorite places in town.  But today it gets 4 stars because I need more meat in my taco!  When a taco has 80 times more lettuce than meat, it needs help.  Cafe Rio needs a meat intervention, NOW!!    I ordered a grilled steak taco and watched the employee put a nice scoop of meat on my tortilla.  And then he did the unforgiveable - he took the spoon and removed HALF the meat off back into the meat container. NOOOOOO!    But as it usually goes at Cafe Rio, the queso and chips - along with the rice and beans - make me enjoy my meal despite the meat removal.    My hubby had the enchiladas with hot sauce and they were gone in about 10 seconds.  He gives them 5 stars.    I need more meat.  A taco without meat is not a taco!"}
{"text":"Worst service and the manager doesn't care. I stop here on my way back to LA every time I come to vegas. I've never had horrible service like this. Last time I'll ever step foot in this place."}
{"text":"I just had a salad and holy plastic came with the sauce yea not!....i told someone and i got a free meal card like that will happen"}
{"text":"I usually love Cafe Rio and went to this location all the time. I ordered chips and queso and a burrito with medium sauce and a steak quesadilla. Well first off i don't write reviews on Yelp unless it is terrible or outstanding. This is my second review and let me start off by saying the customer service was TERRIBLE. I stood at the register to pick up my to go order for about 5-10 minutes, meanwhile THREE employees looked at me and then clocked out for break at the same register I was waiting at and didn't even acknowledge me. Then when someone finally rang me up I paid and then waited for my food some more when it should have been ready when I got there. As I'm waiting  for awhile, after I paid, an employee comes up to tell me they're out of medium sauce and I said okay I'll take the mild I guess. Then once they tell me my order is ready I grab it and look in the bag and realize my chips and queso aren't in there. I have to get an employees attention again and they tell me oh I'm sorry we're out of queso. They failed to tell me that before I paid or even when I went to grab my order. Needless to say, I won't be back because it was that bad.."}
{"text":"Just got back from picking up the food. Horrible customer service. An employee pretty much forcing me to buy a drink after I said 'no' twice. Always rude service, this time my order was wrong n I called the first time and they said that I had the correct order and they no mistakes and put on hold for 10 min for the manager. I hung up and dialed again this time I sounded annoyed and got the manager quick. I was very disappointed more than usual. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE UNLESS U WANT TO BE TREATED RUDE AND BE WRONG ON WHAT YOU ORDER."}
{"text":"I felt extremely rushed, and they weren't even  busy when I went in. The guy that put my chicken and rice in my burrito barely put any in it and then only asked if I wanted lettuce I said no thank you, he then passed it to the girl working. I asked her for sour cream in it. She just wrapped it up...not wanting to be rude I didn't say anything I just asked her to put some on the side for me..... I asked for two green sauces they only gave me one. I asked for the second one and got some major attitude. I personally work in customer service and I have to say the last thing you want for a customer to feel like is that they interrupted what you were doing especially when there paying $9 for a burrito...I was very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Love the grilled chicken salad  delish... Got all my ladies at working eating here to."}
{"text":"Costumer service is terrible, the night shift staff has no discipline. The line is messy I didn't even want to eat my food when I got it. Staff was wondering around like they didn't care about the line they had, I was in line for more than 20 minutes. Which made the line even longer, & my meal was made incorrectly. Over all this is by far the worst experience I've ever had at cafe rio, STAY OUT OF THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Sucks!!!! Food is tastelessness to the core.... Go to Taco Bell around the corner!! My friend and I stood on a stupid line like a jail cafeteria and the menu was just not clear... I just felt like I was going to be stripped searched... The best part was the drink bar!!! If someone is treating me and insisted on going i would consider going.... But would suggest something else first.... I hope they go out of business and a good restaurant takes its place!!!"}
{"text":"The three stars goes to the food. I can't say this Cafe Rio has the best version of cafe rio but it's still good. What I cannot stand about this place is the quality of service. Anytime I go in there we wait. And wait. And wait. Then usually they are out of something. Either some meat, guac, or dressing. Or all of them! Drives me crazy that a group of staff members (which they are usually looking fully staffed) can't stay up on everything. And today I even called to place an order. 30 minute wait. Even my fresh cooked Thai food and my fav restaurant is ready in 15 minutes. Anyways, the food gets the stars. Definitely not the service."}
{"text":"Hahahahah this place is a joke the line workers were very unorganized and frazzled, there were only 2 other people ordering at the time, and my girlfriend and I almost walked out before witnessing more chaos... Thank goodness the food was good but I wouldn't recommend this location at all I asked for a discount and free drinks, the cashier smirked and could only shake her head and obliged my request as she saw the debacle that just happened...."}
{"text":"So yummy, all I want to know is how come I have never been to this place before. The food is excellent, you need to be patient though as they're extremely busy and a little disorganized but the prize at the end of the line makes it worth it"}
{"text":"I've been to cafe rio multiple times and I always get a burrito with everything on it, apparently tonight I'm not allowed to get both black and pinto beans? Well I guess I can't get my regular order anymore hopefully it's just this location."}
{"text":"The food is good not awesome to my taste, but the fact that 95% of the time they rush me thru the line and dont understand what im telling them.. gets on my nerves.. Besides the language barrier ive never seen the place dirty at least not inside I knw they keep alot alot of trash next to their back door. I dont understand why its soo hard to just take it to the dumpster its right infront of the restaurant anyways!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice for Taco Tuesday. The tacos are two dollars and then it is only two dollars more to add rice, beans, and drink on Tuesdays. One taco meal fills me up, two tacos each for the kid and husband. I have read some of the bad reviews, and either they have straightened things out, or they put on their happy faces for taco Tuesday. It is clean, the hand made tortillas are AMAZING, and the servers are nice. They have to sing a little song when someone orders extra cheese which is adorable. It is true, though- they charge you extra for everything including the essential sour cream. And anything not on special is way expensive!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Cafe Rio...but the customer service at this location is ALWAYS awful. 2 or 3 people on the line, 5 or more people prepping, but no one jumps in to make the food prep more efficient or quicker. I'm sorry but I'm over the poor attention at this location, this company should be ashamed of their customer service. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Cafe rio been eatting their food numerous times. I first was offered a free meal when the w sahara location first opened I had the chicken salad with the ranch special dressing and was hooked.   I lived in many parts of las Vegas and still find myself going to this place when I crave some food that is tasty but is not overlapsed with cheese and typical Mexican overwhelming heavy ingredients.  Atmosphere is very casual and friendly for families.  Service is quick and to the point: let's get your food and enjoy  went to the gran opening of cafe rio and the one also in Maryland parkway across unlv.  Very friendly both times   Can't go wrong for a dinner after a day of work."}
{"text":"great lunch today had the big kahoona which we split between two people.good bbq with pinapple chunks. have also trye the north shore hugh sanwich fresh taste and good service .set out on the patio enjoyed the day"}
{"text":"This place is consistent.  Food is good.  It's definitely a weekly dinner stop for my family."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be comparable to Costa Vida, but it sucks. The service we received was awful. They neglected to include sweet pork in our nachos ordered to-go. So we drove all the way back to get a fresh new order. What did they give us?? JUST THE SWEET PORK! And the portion was so meager. So now, an hour and a half after making our order, we are sitting down to eat a small scoop of sweet pork with rubbery, cold cheese and cold beans served over cold chips. When my wife mentioned the problem to the cashier, the catty girl at the register offered her extra chips and salsa (Which we don't want) and said, \"I'm sorry but that's all we can do.\" It's one thing to screw up an order, but it's another thing to charge full price for it and refuse to rectify the situation.   I called back and asked to talk to a manager. The manager was very apologetic and said I could come in another time for a free meal. I'm still not sure if I'm even interested in free food there. The food was subpar, even if it was fresh. Smh."}
{"text":"Really dislike new crew. Don't see a familiar face. And crew member did not listen to my request.  Will not be back to this location"}
{"text":"LOVE CAFE RIO! Anything that pork is awesome! This is a nice friendly location too. HOWEVER, never call in an order and expect it to be ready when they say it will... It is faster just to show up and wait in line."}
{"text":"They were very rude that overcharged for everything the people slapped my food around pretty disrespectful and I will not be going back it's unfortunate because it's a good area"}
{"text":"Ordered a burrito enchilada style with barbacoa pork and OMFG was it gooooooood! Could eat only half as the thing was massive in size."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a Cafe Rio in the last week.  Both locations, LV and Cedar City, UT, had a clueless staff.  Really, a total disaster, except for one individual at the Cedar City location, who actually cared enough to make sure we finally received our food.    I thought I'd give them another chance at a different location (this LV location) and found very similar results - bland, over-sauced, overly sweet, zero-heat (both senses of the word), lack of organization, incorrectly charged, clueless and careless staff.  I'd go to Chipotle any day over Cafe Rio.  And yes, the wait time was horrible at 7:30pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The portion is way too small compared to other location. This is the first time we try out this location. The tostada was barely filled up half way because they was so cheap on the ingredient. Would not come back to this location again."}
{"text":"So, my husband ventured out last night to pick up dinner for the family.  I told him I was craving mexican and so he decided to come home with Cafe Rio.  He got one barbacoa burrito, one chicken burrito and a side order of chips (which he put some cheese sauce on).  These were the biggest burritos I have ever seen... not sure exactly what he paid for them but they weren't the best I've had.  The barbacoa was really sweet like they simmered it in sugar and the chicken was really dry.  If it wasn't for the guacamole and the salsa I put on it there was no way I could have eaten it.  It was good and maybe we will go back, but we will definetly try something else next time."}
{"text":"This location is terrible! They constantly screw up my order I.e. Order chicken but receive beef or they run out of chicken...your whole staff is terrible"}
{"text":"We went about a week after opening, so it wouldnt be as busy as the first day. Also, im figuring new employees need some time to get it. We walk in, its really busy on a Monday at 12, understandably. I figure lets give it a chance. We order, looks good. The only thing I didn't like is the public braiding by the manager to his new empoyees, they are learning teach them. Also, I didnt like that the employees were arguing amongst themselves, treating each other poorly. Now on too the food. First my steak was beyond salty, and had no flavor. Next my wife's chips on her nachos were stale. Lastly, the chicken on her nachos tasted old and lacked flavor. Needless to say, we probably won't be back. Chipotle has also been great, and this proved there is no need to steer away from them."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was mediocre and somewhat tasteless.  Restaurant looked dirty, tables not cleaned, garbage on floors....no one was bussing or cleaning."}
{"text":"Love love love cafe rio! Steak salad is amazing! Expect a wait though because everyone loves to eat here :)"}
{"text":"Went in at 5pm on a Thursday. Pretty busy, but i got my food fairly quickly. It was my first time here and the staff sang a really fun song and made me feel welcome. i ordered the sweet pork burrito and let me just say it was phenomenal!!! The reason i only gave one star is because they didn't have gluten free tortillas."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on friends who love it.  The food was just average but the price was a little high.  It was packed so I was rushed through the line, unable to see what they were putting on my burrito. Stick with Chipotle where the food is fresh and you can see wth they are making!!"}
{"text":"The service at this cafe rio is by far the worst of any location I have been too. On multiple occasions we have placed a call a head order only to arrive at the time Oder was to be ready and been forced to wait 30+ min for our meal. This is beyond unacceptable. If you are going to offer the to go ordering service you need to be prepared to handle it in a timely and satisfactory manner. Setting a pick up time and then forcing customers to wait an extra 30 min defeats the purpose of this service. Offering a \"free\" drink after such a wait is not an acceptable offer nor does it show you care about customers. To have this happen on more than one occasion does not make frequenting this location worth the effort. We like cafe rio but will no longer be coming here because of the terrible service and poorly run operations."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best Mexican food I've had in the entire country. Cafe Rio is the epitome of \"fresh\". I always go for the pork barbacoa tacos, unless I visit on a Tuesday in which case I like the coconut shrimp taco daily special.  The service is usually friendly. I admit that I'm a shade uneasy with the ordering system: due to the Subway-style production line, it's easy for things to get a little messy e.g. when you're ready to move to the salsa \"station\" and the person in front of you is still customizing their dish....but the food is so good that I'm willing to experience that small hassle."}
{"text":"Let me just say I'm new to yelp and figured I must add a review. I been to this new location 3 times now and I can say I don't want to return.  Went in a week ago to get my usual salad and while ordering my food I had to yell for them to hear me. I got to the cashier and she was very nice and told me the next time I come in I have a free meal on my stamp card considering I had 9 before I went in there. So I came in today to get my free meal and bought one also for a friend, a different cashier told me I would buy one meal and get one free. After paying I asked for a new stamp card and she handed me one with no stamps? Confused, I asked for a stamp and she told me I didn't have enough on my previous card to get one and argued with me. I had 10 stamps enough for one free and I bought a meal, but yet she couldn't give me a new stamp for the one I bought? Horrible customer service. Get it together."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has some pretty decent food. However, this location is the worst. We used to go about once a week but it is just so painfully slow. We started ordering online, and eating it there, in order to cut back on the time it takes. Sadly, even that was messed up. They almost always had items missing from the order, or something wasn't prepared right. We still go from time to time but not nearly as often as we used to. The lunch service seems to be MUCH better than the dinner service."}
{"text":"I  like this place! I wasn't a fan of the sweet pork, just too sweet so I switched with another person at my table that liked it . There is pretty much always a line but the food is great and the service isn't bad either"}
{"text":"We called in a very large order for the office and the customer service was amazing. Our order was ready on time and was awesome thank you for being so efficient. Way to go Café Rio!"}
{"text":"I live for Cafe Rio, but this particular location is disappointing. The customer service is really substandard. It wasn't busy when I came here, but everybody working was so slow and unfriendly. I went unacknowledged waiting in line while the employees were conversing amongst each other with my food right in front of them. If you ignore the poor service, the food is still good. I'll stick to the Eastern location next time though."}
{"text":"yum yum yum the tostadas are SOOOO YUMMMY! i want to try other things but every time i go there i end up getting the same! so good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to cafe rio since someone stole his idea and called it cafe cabo. So it's been years. And I've been to the eastern location as well as the one in Stephanie. This one is TERRIBLE! a bunch of teenagers running the back. One yelling at her coworkers screaming profanities.   The food was not as good as the other ones. My guacamole was black and old. Ew.   And the WORST part of it all was the straws. Whoever owns this one must be too cheap. All the other locations have individually wrapped straws... This one has a pile of straws in the straw container UNWRAPPED! EW! Is that even complying with health codes?! So disgusting. All the peoples dirty hands ugh so gross. Needless to say I won't be returning to this one.    Ew."}
{"text":"Great food. But they are ALWAYS out of something. Pico de Gallo or lettuce or grilled chicken. It really slows up the line and all business in general. If you live closer to another location I would never come here. Unfortunately I live across the street."}
{"text":"We started coming to Cafe Rio now instead of Chipotle.  We get a better bang for our $ since Chipotle kept skimming on the portion sizes. The ingredients at Cafe Rio are fresh and the portion sizes are big!!  You can watch them make fresh tortillas while you wait in line."}
{"text":"This location is abysmal, terrible customer service, out of items,Wait is horrible, 30 min wait in line when there was only about 20 customers in front of me. They were out of chips and salsa...what kind of Mexican place runs out of chips and salsa. Overall the employees don't know what they are doing and service is painfully slow. Avoid this location, you could drive to the baseline cafe rio and be fed faster than going to this location, better yet just go to local Mexican places like backyard taco and Boca."}
{"text":"What's going on with this Cafe Rio?!? We have been coming here a long time. Always consistently good and clean. Not today!"}
{"text":"Sadly, we're over this location. Clearly, the management of this location is pitiful. The food is pretty standard Rio food, but the mishaps have become too frustrating. We go there about weekly for takeout and every, yes every, time they mess something up. Last night, it was the salad dressings. They messed up on which dressing was included with the salad and didn't include the pint house dressing that we bought. The time before, it was the soda we bought that they forgot. The time before that, it was a 30 minute wait in line. Oh, and spoke to the manager the most recent time who was less than concerned. And so on, and so on. I'm over it. It's easily my favorite fast food place in vegas, but the frustration and 35 minute round trips to get whatever they forgot is too much. Farewell Sahara Rio. No more delicious gut-bombs for us!"}
{"text":"I am giving this one star because I can't give a lower rating.   I was there for over am hour trying to order a pork burrito. After 35 minutes in line,  when I got up to where I could order,  they were out of pork so I elected to wait the extra 20 minutes they said it would be.  I sat at a table and took a 20 minute nap. Then,  as instructed,  I went to the cashier (who was NOT at all helpful) to give her my order.  She continued to check people out and after almost 15 minutes,  took my order.  I waited another 20 minutes before other employees noticed and asked what was going on.   Three different people ended checking on my order before I got it.  They did give it to me free but that definitely didn't make up for it.  I spoke to another woman who was also waiting and discovered she had ordered ON-LINE (it is supposed to be VERY fast if you do that.   She waited just over 45 minutes for her order.   I will NEVER go there again,  nor well I patronize any of their affiliates.  I hope anyone who reads this also doesn't go there.   They obviously don't care about their patrons. Update:  When I got home and opened the box,  it was missing lettuce,  pico , napkins, and tableware.  Really ?????"}
{"text":"Sadly this location is going down hill fast.  They are in such a rush (even if there is no line) that they don't listen to your order and just slop ingredients on your plate like it's a prison line. The beans and salsas are not drained and it turns whatever you are eating into soup."}
{"text":"I'll give it two stars because the food wasn't totally terrible. I love Cafe Rio but this is the last time I eat at this one. The employees all seemed incapable of putting beans, rice and cheese in a tortilla. Now I've never worked in this particular industry but even I know that ain't rocket science. Too bad because it was close to my house."}
{"text":"With all the low ratings I am surprised management has not responded to any of these reviews. I usually enjoy eating here, I especially like the freshly made tortillas.   Today I went in and I was really disappointed in the appearance of the food station. It was like I walked into a kitchen ran by a two year old.  Food was all over the place. I was actually surprised my wife stayed. If I was in charge of that store location or any of these chains, I would have stopped all food prep until that area was clean.   At first I thought they went through a food rush and they were so busy know one had time to clean up. NOPE it was an employee who just didn't care. She was slinging food everywhere. I found the two year old. I get it people have bad days but push that sh*t to the side and take pride in your job. If you're having a bad day call in or if you hate it quit.   Cafe Rio should be really disappointed in both the employee and management.   I should have taken a picture but I just wanted to get out of line. Next time!"}
{"text":"After a long day of running errands, we wanted to end our night with a good meal. We ordered our food online and said it would be ready by 430. We arrived at 425 thinking it would be ready by the time we paid for our meal. After waiting at the pick up area for 5 minutes, we still were not helped. The cashier didn't acknowledge us at all and when she did decide to help us, told us that our food was not ready. She ran our debit card and said it was declined even though we had sufficient funds. After running out to the car to get cash, she said it actually went through.  Now the wait begins. It is now 435 and still no food. We wait another couple of minutes thinking they were going to start making our food and nope still no food. We waiting another 20 minutes and still no food. The cashier kept looking down the line to see if it was being made but never said anything to the workers making the food. She never apologized or anything.  We reminded her several times that we were waiting for our food and still nothing. After waiting another 5 minutes and no attempt for our food to be made we asked to cancel our order of two burritos. She called the manager over who didn't acknowledge us at all, didn't offer us an apology, nothing. He processed our refund and that was the end of it. This was probably one of the worst customer service experiences we have ever experienced. They have lost a loyal customer who has been going there for years."}
{"text":"I ordered my office meal....showed up 15 minutes after the requested pick up time and the order was not started until 35 minutes after pick up time.   This is the worst CR in the valley!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Cafe Rio's steak salad.  I can not get enough of it.  Great prices and great food.  The costumer service is always great and everyone working is extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"First time to visit a Café Rio and will be my last.  To me this is just another Chipotle but now a single burrito is $10 without a side of rice and beans.  If the burrito was something special then $10 would be fine but considering Roberto's has a great steak burrito with guac for $5.50 I would never consider going back to Café Rio.  Also we were overcharged for a beef burrito but let it slide since the line was too long to ask for our $1 back.  Hopefully the athletes in this years Olympics have better food to eat in Rio than Rio brings to us through \"Café Rio\". Save your money.  And there is nothing here any more healthier than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This location needs to get it together. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered food to go and the order is completely messed up. Shame on me for giving this spot numerous chances. I've also noted this place needs to keep on top of cleaning and sanitary measures. I continue to notice AND tell employees that the ice tea dispensers seem to always have no lids. Tonight I politely reminded them of how unsanitary it is...her response, \"Oh, we forget to put lids on.\""}
{"text":"The food is very good and the portion are very generous. I eat here about once a week at least.   My son and I just love it."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is always great but I've never waited as long so many times at any Cafe Rio. I keep going back to this one and continually upsetting myself knowing yet hoping it might be different. Sadly it never is. Long or short line it just seems to take forever and is oddly different from other Cafe Rio's. The employees don't seem to care like they hate their job. Food is amazing since it's a chain it's pretty much the same at all of them but the staff is the reason for the rating."}
{"text":"Their fired grilled chicken is AMAZING! Along with their mild sauce! Love this place!! It's my favorite fast casual Mexican restaurant... I even like it more than chipotle... Crazy right? .....I have ordered somethings from Cafe Rio that I'll never order again... So if you have given this place a try & didn't like it... Try something different! Promise you'll became an addict like me! Ha!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this place is horrible.   I can not believe that there are 4 stars after our experience here.   My friends and family wanted to go out to have a fun and cost effective meal for dinner and since this was one of our friends favorite places we decided to give it a shot.   Wow, we were in for a surprise. We waited in a long line to finally get to the counter where we were rudely greeted with what do you want! Yep that's what she said we placed our order of 2 pork nachos and 1 pork salad and 1 grilled chicken salad. Then we were quickly rushed to the next rude lady that really pushed the customer service line to a new low she holds our salad and stares at us for about a minute and then says \" ok so what is that you want I don't have all day\" I couldn't believe it  Since this was our first time visiting this place I didn't really know it was like a subway where you pick your toppings! Sorry we are rookies!!   I tell her we will take everything on it then she glares at us and pretty much just slops everything on there and looks up and says ok now what kind of dressing. We say um what are our options?   What happens next I could not even explain in words that will justify her actions. She snarled at us dropped our plate on the counter and grabbed the next one in line to ours which so happened to be our nachos!! She looks at the other customer in line and asks them \" what do you want on the nachos\"   Her face was priceless when the dude told her that those are not his!! She looks back at us and realizing that the next four plates are ours!! Decides to then be somewhat helpful.   We finally make it to the register and even the person ringing us up says sorry about that is there anything else I can help you with!!   Overall it was a terrible experience and over priced food. I don't know how there pork won awards as in my opinion it wasn't all that great and the customer service made this place terrible.   The nachos were ok, I have had better at taco bell! There signature salad plate is a great idea and wasn't terrible but poorly executed. I would never recommend this place and I can find a better place to spend $45 bucks for dinner."}
{"text":"I usually like Cafe Rio...but this location kind of turned me off. It's dirty. Especially outside and I like to eat outside. Because it's dirty, there are flies and gnats all over. It's gross...and they are everywhere."}
{"text":"Pros:  Great customer service.  Food is good A lot of varieties to chose from.   Cons: Parking area is small and hard to find a parking spot during the busy hours.   We order a fresh lime pie that tasted very sour, wasn't fresh at all. It seems like it's been there for awhile"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. If there's one thing I can't resist, a good plate of Mexican food! Unfortunately I was disappointed, almost from the get go!   Service was mediocre at best. I constantly let the young lady helping me know that it was my first time at cafe rio, she seemed more agitated then excited to have a new customer. She really was no help at all. I asked for sour cream cheese and pico on my burrito, she said I could only have cheese because they have to put it in the oven. I explained to her I didn't want it in the oven, she basically said there was no choice. I told her just to make me something since I obviously don't understand how to order and I can't have what I'm telling you I want. Instead of offering me assistance she looked relieved and just made something.   Not very good, tasted microwaved honestly. Kinda sad.   Basically my experience and the food were undesirable and I won't be back. $20 for a burrito with chips and guacamole and a drink.   Best part, bottomless horchata!! That's why I gave the one star.. dam good horchata too..ironically"}
{"text":"Lately the cleanliness has really gone down. It is difficult for Vegetarians to partake when they are constantly dropping meat in the sauces."}
{"text":"I came here at this location for the first time, 1/17/16 about 8:40pm. I order steak tacos and chicken tacos with side rice and pinto bean. Chicken were so dry and no season, the steak under season too. Rice and bean with lack of flavor. My wife order quesadillas with bbq pork, she don't like it. I has bad experience here, I went to another cafe Rio the one at bluediamond rd, they are good."}
{"text":"Just walked in to cafe rio and it is 940. They say they close at 10. They refused to take our order and said they have already thrown away all of the food. How can a business be ran this way?"}
{"text":"I went in this place yesterday. As I was waiting in line I was just watching the workers on the line. And I noticed. The lady making the tortillas bend down touch the dirty water bucket with her gloves on then continue to make the tortillas and not even change her gloves. If that wasn't bad enough. I turned around to notice the other girl filling a take out order drop a receipt on the floor and reach down and pick it up off the floor with her gloves on then continue to make the take out order without taking off those gloves after touching the dirty floor. I then pulled the manager aside and who came over was a teenage boy that said he was a manager but I was sure he was not. After telling him what I witness and I didn't want to make a scene since there was a line full of customers. He didn't seem to care what I had to say. Seems to me that the ppl that work here don't care about cleanliness .. Totally grossed out and I hope the health dept catches up to them soon so then maybe they will take it seriously."}
{"text":"This is literally the last time I deal with this location.   As a general manager of another food establishment I understand the regular issues that can happen; - someone taking an order incorrectly  - someone making the order incorrectly  - someone not performing a final quality check before the order is given to the guest  These are all things that happen, and I would be the type of person to be understanding due to my job.  My experience today was beyond unsatisfactory.  First I called in my order around 12 with a 45 min quote for pick up. That's ok, it's lunch. I am stuck at my job all day anyways 630 am to 7 pm so waiting for a good lunch is worth it. I order the same thing everytime. When Alexis answered the phone she seemed side tracked and not interested; she didn't even repeat the order to me. My order was rang up correctly on my receipt though (I later saw) so it had to be someone on the line. I had my driver pick up the order for me; I buy them lunch every Monday. The total cost of it was $36 and some change, so it should be worth it. When I got my order it was completely wrong. The sauce was wrong. The burrito was wrong. The toppings were wrong. But the receipt was right.   I call the location back and tell Alexis (who answers the phone again) that I wanted a refund on my burrito (just the part wrong) and she told me to hold and I went to a silent phone. Then mike got on the phone. I ask if he's the manager and he ignored me. He was so rude and short with me plus didn't even know the situation. I re-explained everything to him and he told me a refund couldn't be done without the card present. I ask him again is he the manager and he says no she is on the line. Now, I work at a food place remember? And I know when a guest calls, especially about a refund, you step away and handle the situation. I tell him I will hold till she is done and he says she has a meeting at 230 so she'll call me back before she goes. He takes my name and phone number down, and tells me she will call me back before her meeting. It's now been two hours and no call.  This is the WORST customer service I have ever experience and if ANY of my employees treated someone this way or my shift leader did not address the situation immediately I would immediately reevaluate their role in my location!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worse cafe rios I have been to. The place is usually messy, at least the times we visited it, it wasn't the cleanest. I have been like 4-5 times and everytime I go I get s stomache ache so I'm done visiting this location, at least."}
{"text":"I work here and I am not reviewing my own place of work. I just wanted to apologize on behalf of the establishment. I understand we are new and training new people but after being open for a month we are becoming calmer and hardly have any mess ups during the lunch hours. If you do decide to go back ask for either a manager to make your food or the to-go person they take their time with the food and will treat you well. Again I apologize some of you had bad experiences with our location and I will be sure to let my bosses know."}
{"text":"So, I have been to more than a few Café Rios all over the valley and even out of state, and unfortunately this place doesn't do the name justice. You would think being a chain the food would all be the same, unfortunately this was much lower quality than any of the other establishments I have been to. The beans were undercooked, their assembly line was terrible, beans in the rice, cilantro in the cheese, a cup in the house dressing.. I didn't really want to complete the order, but my fiancé insisted.   Aside from the mediocre food the service was horrible, they threw the salad together like taking my order was annoying to them. The worst part was the straws.. Not individually wrapped.. I don't know if this is the manager's doing or the owner's.. Either way, the Café Rio name will only take you so far. Hopefully you aren't failing on purpose."}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent.  Yes, the food is pretty good sometimes, or it SHOULD be.  There had been a couple times when it was too salty and didn't taste quite right.  But, I have to admit, I do like their salad which is the only reason why I end up being tempted and end up going back.  The service, on the other hand is consistant...  IT IS TERRIBLE EVERY SINGLE TIME!  Service is SLOW and the workers are plain rude!  Everytime I go there I vow to never come back.  This time I really mean it!"}
{"text":"I typically LOVE Cafe Rio...  I have eaten at Cafe Rio over 100 times and this was by far my worst experience yet!  The line was all backed up yet they kept taking orders...  Yelling across the lobby to the back of the line of what people wanted.  By the time I actually got up there my food was cold and the tortillas were stale...  Then when we finally paid for the food, my son spilled a drink - he went and asked one of the employees for a rag to clean up and they handed him 1 napkin...  My son said it was an entire drink so they gave him 10 napkins and offered no help!  Then as I kept taking dripping napkins from the table to the trash I couldn't help but overhear the 3 employees just standing in front of the soda machine talking about how bad it was to work there and how no one is trained including the person on the grill that day that had no training!  This location is officially on the boycott list!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! I grew up in Salt Lake and they are all over, sad that there is only one here in AZ but I do make the drive! I love the pork burrito and the queso is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really like their burritos. Never had s bad experience in food choice. Staff is most of the times friendly. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the staff at this Cafe Rio they were very observant and noticed that my wife works for Metro and offered her the Metro discount very kind and considerate everybody there is very nice never a bad experience at this location very Metro friendly"}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch! The variety is great and the service is really fast."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying i really love the food. The only reason its 3 star's is because the pork tostada and chicken burrito are always good. We started going to this location about 3 years ago. First, we ordered online all the time. Our food was always wrong! We thought maybe the first few times it was just an accident (it happens), but after nearly 6 times of it being wrong I emailed the manager (not looking for any hand outs but just to let her know). I got a response and of course was offered a free meal and hopes of us coming back. Of course we went because we still love their food but now, we just go in thinking that would be better. Well, everytime there is a line because they move at a snails pace and it seems like noone knows what their role is. Last week my food fell on the floor because noone was watching the oven that they roll the food through! They werent even really that busy at the time and the cook was litterally 1 foot away and he watched it slowly fall off the side!! It takes them 5 minutes to go get jalapenos from somewhere in the back and most of the time we have to ask again for someone to get them because they forget. The last few times the ice has been out too and the cleanliness of the dining area is meh. The sad part is, its mostly a new staff since when we first started going there so I dont see how there are still so many issues."}
{"text":"So third try, not a charm. Everytime I have tried the Summerlin location the service is horrible. Today I was the only person in line and it was like I was bothering them with my basic order as they hurried me along not listening to anything I ordered. By the way besides the employee making my food every employee behind the counter were on their cell phones. The portions may be big but the flavor it's blah....."}
{"text":"athe food was good was but the cashier's attitude ruined the meal."}
{"text":"Been here twice on separate occasions thinking that my impression would change, but no.  This location specifically is under staffed and it reflects on their dining area which has dirty tables, semi working fountain drink dispensers, and non functioning bathrooms. Food wise, I ordered their chicken salad and my friend had the pork and chicken taco meal and a side of chips and salsa. My salad was pretty bland and the chicken was dry. The pork taco was pretty good according to my friend but the salsa was pretty bland and didn't taste fresh. I think the one on the east side has far better and fresher food and cleaner dining area."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cafe Rio since I think was the original in St. George about 15 years ago. They certainly were not in Nevada at that time. Food was always amazing. I've been to three locations in LV and the service and food is nothing like it was. I order for ten or more to go and guaranteed at least 1 is wrong every time. The one on Maryland was even downgraded to B rating. I've never seen that and here have been some nasty places. They have since fixed whatever the problem was."}
{"text":"My wife just left the restaurant with 4 meals. All meals had no rice because they ran out. Called to complain and the manager was rude and told me that there was a sign stating no rice available. Wrong! There was no sign! Manager would not offer any free meal just chips and salsa. I will never give them.my business again! I'll patronize Wahoos right down the  street from now on!  Don't come into our neighborhood and be all full of yourself and expect our business!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. My husband and I usually share a pork salad with black beans and rice. The house dressing is pretty amazing too. Also, get shredded lettuce on the salad. It really makes a difference in my opinion. My kids like the kids meals. My two older boys are starting to eat more so they will share a burrito (the burritos are HUGE). Thy also offer free kids cheese quesadillas for kids 6 and under. Great perk for a family eating out. If you get a burrito be sure to get it enchilada style.  They offer a punch card and every 10th meal is free. Another great perk  Please don't compare this to chipotle. They are just not the same. Very different flavors and a slightly different style. I love both establishments but if you're comparing you're either going to like one or the other. Keep this in mind and appreciate them both for what they are individually."}
{"text":"Even though they have 5000 people in line (exaggeration), the service was very fast and friendly. All the employees seem to be having a good time. Food, of course, is always excellent"}
{"text":"Love their salads.  I generally don't order salads at restaurants, but these are so delicious I crave them often."}
{"text":"Good, consistent, friendly service, these are the top three adjectives that I can think of to describe Cafe Rio.  While it is a chain, I prefer it to Chipotle, as I know it happens to be slightly healthier, and the staff there are fun to talk to as you go through the line.  I'm a fan of the tostada and salads, and I like that they make their tortillas fresh right there in the store, and that you can watch them make everything.  I'm also slightly biased in that it's affordable and near the UNLV campus, which as a student makes it very convenient for me."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they've opened.  At first I thought the service issues were due to it being a new restaurant.   However every single time I've been there it sees like it takes 20 minutes just to get through line and get your food.   Keep in mind it is 2:38 pm and this place is not busy right now.   Staff seems confused, unmotivated and not working efficiently.   I'm not sure this business will make it unless things turn around.   Probably the last time I'll be back."}
{"text":"Do you want slow service, a sloppy food service area and a bland plate of \"Mexican\" food? Well this is the place for you. Enjoy your over priced meal and twenty plus minute wait time."}
{"text":"This location is BLAH!  I usually go to the Eastern & Richmar location but we were on this side of town and I was craving Cafe Rio. The long line didn't bother me because I'm used to it but...   1. The employees here are not friendly at all. They do not smile. They do not greet you. The shift manager's (Stephanie) attitude showed she hated her job! She was the 2nd person on the line that adds lettuce, pico, etc. She wasn't listening to what me & my husband was telling her. She had no care in the world how she was treating everyone's food. Very sloppy.   2. Food quality - THUMBS DOWN! They served dead lettuce. I ordered the tamales and the guy served me a crumbled - into pieces- broken tamales. If my husband didn't ask for a new one, he would of just sold it to me like that. It broke into pieces because it was DRY.   AND THEY CAN OUT OF PICO AT 7:30 PM - during a busy dinner service! OMG!  What a shame! This location needs revamping in their food quality and their attitudes. We won't be going to this location ever."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio.  I go to this location most often.  I get the same thing almost always, a shredded chicken tostada.  The food is fantastic, fresh, made to order.  My only complaint is that is they are often busy and when it's busy, the employees go so fast, I often miss out on stuff I wanted...they just quickly move on and don't offer all the things I want.  It's frustrating.   But, I love the food so much I keep coming back, and try and remind myself to be more forceful about what I want!"}
{"text":"No one knows how to communicate and work together as a team here. Seems like they are always one step behind. Food is always good so that is a huge plus. But is it worth the wait? I've had people leave behind me. Hope this place shapes up cause it's a hidden location. Only the people that live up here on the hill really know about it."}
{"text":"Decent price.  Fast.  Ok staff..... but it is fast food so I can't rate any higher than 3."}
{"text":"The food is great, especially the pork barbacoa salad. Everything is fresh and the tortillas are incredible.   The restaurant decor is fun. HOWEVER, going there any day around lunch time is loud and if you want to hear the person you are with...good luck. Every time I have been there (at least 10), there are always groups of screaming kids, and the moms just seem to let them run around. What can I say...the food is good...I now get it to go."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cafe Rio restaurants for almost 10 years and this is by far the worst location.  Their service is terrible, employees barely know how to make a burrito, food is constantly old, under portioned, they won't cook grilled chicken 2 hours before closing.  I reported this location to Cafe Rio corporate, hopefully they do something about it."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat and always a friendly staff. The food is always good and I have never had a problem"}
{"text":"Kinda grossed out tonight normally love this place but the expo tonight was wearing gloves then Used cleaning product to wipe down the counter still with her gloves on and when a guy and his daughter ordered there food she wiped her hands with the dirty rag and made there quesadillas and tacos!! Super gross gloves are meant to be worn and once you touch chemicals or a dirty rag you should change them before going back to touch the food. This is stuff you should already know when working in a restaurant aren't you required to have a health card !!! Because this is a question on there! Management needs to have a talk with there staff about health because if someone were to get sick it could be bad. And to top it all off when I got home to eat my burrito the meat (Asada) was burnt. I won't be back here for a while. Disappointed.."}
{"text":"The employees were rude and gave attitude(like rolling their eyes) when we were not quick enough to order since we had never been to a Cafe Rio before. Originally I gave them more stars but they had my original review removed."}
{"text":"Holy cow this is my favorite restaurant!!  Their grilled chicken salad is so amazing!  My honey always gets the sweet pork burrito & I have to snag a few bites of it because it is ALSO amazing.   Their house dressing is so good & if you are trying to go healthy you can always just get the salsa fresca as the dressing. It adds a nice little bite to the salad to give it the best flavor around.   I think I've gone through 5-10 of their punch cards for a free meal & have enjoyed every single meal along the way. Go there! Seriously, you won't be disappointed. But watch out for friday & saturday night........It is date night & man does it get packed in there. Totally worth it though!!"}
{"text":"Great food! The service is decent as well. I seriously could eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"Between Chipotle and Cafe Rio, I always go to Cafe Rio. There is a bigger menu, and, overall, the food tastes better. The service is friendly, and the staff is pretty efficient when it comes to keeping the lunch line moving and making sure your order is right.   A few perks: the tortillas are made fresh to order, the lunch deals are a good steal, and there is a variety in drink options besides soda."}
{"text":"Online ordering is pointless because you still end up standing there in the restaurant for 20 minutes. Also, when picking up the food, they failed to read the receipt of what we had ordered. They gave us the bag with only two items of what we ordered. The third time they still had messed up the order and did not give us the extra sides we had ordered. I left because i was done sitting there and ended up paying for more than what i actually got. Very unsatisfactory service."}
{"text":"The food is good but a bit pricey compared to Chipotle. I don't like the fact that they don't tell you that it's extra for enchilada style, cheese on top, etc until you get to the register! I just thought it's deceptive practice! I do like the varieties of drinks that they offer such as different flavors of ice teas and lemonades."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio isn't bad. They have great prices and a punch card system where you get a free meal after 10 visits. The only problem is all of the employees make the food differently. Sometimes you'll get too much cheese while other times there's not enough. I would think that it would be a great place for groups or families. They also have different daily specials that are priced well."}
{"text":"To be honest I don't want to give any stars but I went in last night and got a vegetarian burrito which I was always told by the staff at this location came with double rice double beans and double guac! So tell me why I went in last night and the short fat kid with black hair said no it doesn't! Look I'm getting a damn burrito with rice and beans for 10 fucking dollars does that seem fair at all NO! God forbid they give me another tiny ass scoop of guac! Which probably cost them less than a penny! The boy was very rude and intervened when I asked another employee who told me that it does come with it! This place has never heard of the customer is always right!! Not to mention how disgustingly dirty the store is even before the rush came in!! terrible customer service and very unclean store!! Absolutely disappointed in this establishment and the way it is ran!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but this location is unbelievably SLOW. Employees seem to wander around aimlessly and pop on and off of the assembly line completely uncoordinated. The food is fully cooked and sitting there, what is so hard about putting it together in an efficient manner?  Also, no matter what time you go, busy or not, the line is always a mess. The only reason I go there is the other locations are too far to drive."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Their food is the best. These clowns catered my wedding and forgot the DRESSING for the salad... WTF? Why do their food trays smell like death? Because they don't clean their towels. Everything is sticky and dirty. Have you ever looked at the floor when they are slinging your food all over the place? Down right disgusting. I've had it with this place...."}
{"text":"First time eating there. There were over 10 employees behind the counter and no one had any direction. there were only about 6 customers in the dining area and they were already eating. We were the only ones in line and they were rushing taking our order.  I stated that it was our first time here so we didn't know how things went for the order here. They still didn't be patient with us or change up the un needed speed and sloppiness. Didn't even ask if I wanted corn or flour tortillas for my tacos. after making my food the girl had to redo my order bc I wanted corn tortillas.  Upon check out the guy didn't even say \"thank you, have a great day\" just rushed through with my transaction with a confused look on his face as if I was a burden to him or something.  WORST fast food experience in a very long time..  I've experienced better customer service from A young boy at a Mc Donalds drive through by himself (literally taking, making, and ringing the orders) and a long line of cars were behind me and in front of me. he still was organized and had time to thank us and tell us to have a great day with a smile on his face.   Ps, why have a \"NOW HIRING\" sign up if they o b v I o u s l y had the WHOLE staff behind the counter!? all bad. someone should definitly take some leadership In this location. Makes me think they are all like that."}
{"text":"First off, this place is delicious. Much better than costa vida (well know competitor in my community).  Also, I had a debit card issue with my bank. They gave me the meal free and didn't make me feel awkward or anything. Completely free meal and they gave it with a smile. Clean, friendly, and delicious place to eat! I'll probably eat here a couple times a month for a while :)"}
{"text":"this place is good. the one in 85044 however closed. the one in gilbert I believe is still open."}
{"text":"Hands down worst service in vegas!! Lord forbid any of them crack a smile! I frequent here due to loving the food, plus location wise... It is the best option for us.  At this point the one at centennial may be worth the drive! The owner really needs to get rid of the whole staff and try again. I truly can not stand bad costumer service. Why work in costumer service if you hate it?!? They all seriously look miserable as the THROW your food together! I really hope the owner/manager reads all of these reviews and does something about it."}
{"text":"First off, I am a huge fan of Cafe Rio! I love their food and for the price you can't beat it. BUT at this location, I am always left frustrated and will avoid at all costs! I don't know if it is the manager or what. Guarantee they will be out of something, every time! My favorite was going in at 11:30 asked for the special (salmon tacos) and they were out of salmon!!?? Take your sign down so people don't get excited about it only to be told we don't have it even though we have only been open for an hour. They routinely have been out of salmon, their speciality drinks, or have to wait a long time for more steak or chicken to be cooked. Also, You will have to wait forever in line. They are so slow at this location. The whole experience is painful and why I always go to the other locations to get their yummy food."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go due to a couple of bad reviews but decided to check it out for ourselves. Glad we did. Greeted with a friendly smile by girl doing clean up. Waited on by friendly server who made our orders neatly and promptly. The other folks behind counter quickly responded to our special requests with a smile. We ordered nachos and the whole crew broke out in a short rendition of 'Nacho Man'. Fun, friendly,  clean atmosphere.  Very good food, just like the CR on Centennial. Looks like this location has cleaned up their act.  Perhaps those who wrote the bad reviews will give them another try after all and rescind them."}
{"text":"I love this place it is next to my work and eat here almost every day. The house dressing is amazing; I did my flour tortillas in it yummmmy!!! The manager is super sweeet and always friendly and the staff is super quick at lunch time!!!"}
{"text":"Tried to get in and they were already closed... 30 minutes early. Locked out checked yelp and business locked doors 30 min early"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite spots. It would always be busy so we would have to wait but the staff was friendly and worked quickly to get everyone in and out. We stopped here last night for dinner and should've walked out. The service was horrible. They were NOT busy and we still had to wait. No sense of urgency. Side conversations between workers. Guess we'll be finding a new spot. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Steak Burrito, fast service. This is a good spot to get a fast meal with great products unlike fast food places. You watch them as they cook the meats and make your meal right in front of you."}
{"text":"Their food is OK but the employees are a bunch of idiots and rude people. They don't ask for what you want and they get bitchy if ask for anything like salsa for your tacos! We won't be coming back here ever. They need a manager."}
{"text":"Love this place. Waaaay better than Chipotle. Tyler is the only white boy that can roll burritos better than my grandmother, and Karen's energy is unreal. From the jokes to the quick service and the great food, I can't find any flaws with this staff or restaurant. I'll see you guys tomorrow, same time."}
{"text":"Ordered online once and once I got there i had to wait about 10/15 minuets which was a drag but I'll give them a pass cause it was busy.  Other than that this place was the beeezzneeezzz. Everything on the menu is so good.   If you like Chipotle down the street, that's cool, but if you want something a bit better, you would come to Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"Just tried cafe rio after seeing that it just opened and reviews seemed to be pretty good so far. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito. .. rice was over cooked and bland, the meat and salsas were also very bland. I had them load up the hot salsa and it was milder than the mild from Chipotle. Yes, I'm going there. .. I'd drive the extra 3 miles to get a Chipotle burrito over the cafe rio one that is right down the street from me.  The place is spacious and set up well and the staff is friendly. However, I go to restaurants mostly for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Ordering online and trying to pick up your order is always an ordeal; the food is never ready or the person working the register doesn't know what's going on. I love anything with their sweet barbacoa, but especially the enchiladas. The daily specials are always a good deal! But the service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place needs help, I asked for grilled chicken she gave me steak, then I watch as she scrapes the rice form the bottoms of the pan and only puts two small scoops. The so called manager didn't seem to care and just blew us off. Never coming to this place again."}
{"text":"It is unbelievable how consistently horrible their service is. Every single time I have been to this location, I have encountered one thing or another. I'm not even mad, it's just funny at this point. We continue to go back because the food is good, and we live in the neighborhood. Hopefully they get new management. These rude kids that make up their staff are a joke."}
{"text":"We visited today and love Cafe Rio; however this is our least favorite location. The customer service is lacking, you can't hear the food handlers when asking you for their order, the tall glass divider needs to GO! It was obvious that they didn't care you were there, and wanted to get through your order quickly.  We weren't done wig out order before they we're asking he person behind us what they wanted...when we told them that they looked at us very irritated and with no emotion. Please work on your customer service skills. I even complained and no one cares or said anything. And pleas get rid of the tall glass divider like the other Cafe Rios."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Cafe Rio.  I am not a big fan of Mexican food..However Cafe Rio sold me.  Love it.  The food is delicious.  They were very busy but the line was great and the food fresh.  Great Job!!"}
{"text":"Can't even begin to describe how crazy-awesome this place is! It should seriously be considered a controlled substance, cuz I'm completely addicted. The sweet pork (barbacoa) salad is what I would order for a last meal. The tortillas are melt-in-your-mouth fantastic, always freshly cooked & warm. I'm not trying to exaggerate...it's really that yummy.   When dieting, I go for the grilled salmon salad or the grilled mahi salad...both great options (sans the tortilla, with a very heavy heart). It doesn't taste like diet food at all.  I could eat at Cafe Rio 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night.  Will never go back.  Long lines, huge wait, miserable employees and I swear it was 100 degrees in there.  The place was absolutely filthy.  Tables were not wiped down, garbage overflowing, windows were gross.   The food was just \"okay\", for the money I expected better.  Rice was under cooked."}
{"text":"Called in a $46.00 order to pick up ! Order was ready and on time , only five tables had people, not busy at all ! Got home with good had two chicken burritos , chicken was dry and hard No flavor at at ! Called and asked to speck to a manager, guy said she's kind of busy , I said I'll wait ! Manager came on the phone ! I said I just picked up a order and the two burritos had chicken that was hard and had no taste! She said oh I'll talk to my cook and make sure he's not cooking the chicken to long ! End of conversation, no sorry or anything! Real nice service! Would like a little concern or interest in customer service! Very poor service!"}
{"text":"The food is the same as any other Cafe Rio however the service is awful. In the middle of my order the food line person left. 10 minutes later another new employee came over and had no idea what order was who's. In the meantime  the food sat there getting cold. If you haven't been there yet go soon as I believe this location won't last long."}
{"text":"If you're craving CR don't stop at this location. The food assembly line is DISGUSTING! Rice in the beans, cheese in the cilantro,  plastic lids in the guac AND the sever had a hard time keeping her messy gloved finger out of the dressing....gross.  This location is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Poor customer service,  unorganized,  disgusting food line, very disappointed.  So done with CR! :("}
{"text":"Love cafe rio and this location! So yummy.. Their salads and burritos enchilada style are my favorite! Greta service and very clean Location! Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Awesome service ... Freshness of homemade food... Oh yes, nice music and ambience .."}
{"text":"My family and I adore Cafe Rio.  Everything I've tried there has been excellent (mmm, Tuesday mango shrimp tacos especially!) and the staff is wonderfully polite.  When we dine in with our 20-month-old, we are always given a free child-sized quesadilla with a sliced strawberry on the side.  Cafe Rio makes for a quick, delicious, and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The employees are rude and impatient. They barely give you a split second to decide what you would like to order. Our order was made incorrectly not once, but twice. And the customer is to blame. Unacceptable. I am disgusted with the service received here. I would give it 0 stars. I will never go again and I will make sure all family and friends never go either."}
{"text":"Whole group of workers all so busy goofing off that your orders will be messed up!  Chairs stacked up outside so close to the door that's it's difficult to get in. Stingy portions compared to other Cafe Rios.  Will think twice before returning!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is how fresh everything tastes.  As others have mentioned the handmade tortillas are excellent but over many visits I have always come away impressed by the quality of all the ingredients they put into their dishes.  I usually get the tacos with either roast beef or salmon and both are very tasty.  Make sure to ask for some extra house sauce on the side (as they usually only serve it with certain dishes) because it tastes good on just about anything.  Prices are higher than your typical fast food mexican place, but you can taste the difference and tacos are very filling for what you pay."}
{"text":"My friend talks about this place all the time. So when I came to visit..this was the first stop.  The food was really good, the service was far less. The only complaint on the food is they are not as generous as Chipotle with their guacamole.   The girl at the counter had serious sass.. Having worked in her position for four year- I would never mock a customer. You could tell she was local.. haha They put chicken next to my burrito so they would know it had chicken, even though it was a vegetarian burrito, so I said: \" I did'nt ask for chicken\", and they all looked confused and all started asking each other \"is there chicken in here\", \"hey did you add chicken\" to each other. I thought that was taking too long, you either A. Let me check or B. Just make a new one without all the question asking. Since they didn't get the memo I just said \"I'll check it myself and just let you know\". They didn't get it, so I repeated myself. (It's wasteful to instantly make a new one, so I wanted to make sure it was right before they threw it out.). The girl at the cashier proceeds to mock me and say, \"GUYS, She'll check it herself, she'll check it herself\" in a very rude/ mocking manner.... Oh well, sadly many people don't have great customer service.  Regardless of the rude employees, Cafe Rio is very yummy and if I stumble across another I would go back."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad customer service. Came in with my friend for lunch yesterday, we both say thanks and try to make convo with cashier and she just ignored us. Then, I found a hair inside my salad. Pretty much would say don't go to this location. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best pork it's a sweet pork and on Tuesday the tacos are only 195 they are super good a must try place"}
{"text":"They changed their menu up a little.  They have a 3 taco item, which is better than the 2 taco meal, bc I never liked the beans and rice anyway.  Plus kids eat for free!  Their tortillas are handmade and so fresh and yummy!  The shredded chicken and beef are so juicy!  I'm not a huge fan of their salsa though.  They are always pleasant and nice :)"}
{"text":"This place to me is a way better than chipotle. I like the decor and the way everything is set up. The service is always great the people serving the good are always smiling. If you show up in a bad mood you will be ire to leave in a good mood. The food is incredible of course and healthy"}
{"text":"I usually come here at least once a week for the past several years. I'm finally compelled to write a review on this establishment. The food is good the staff is nice so why am I giving this a 1 star review? Over the year I have noticed a weird musty rotten sock kind of smell from time to time and I couldn't quite figure out what it was. I then figured out that the plastic treys they use to serve the food on are the culprit of this rotten smell. Cafe Rio employees don't actually wash them, they just wipe them down with a rotten smelling dirty and musty smell cloth, which in turn make the trey smell like rotten vomit.   I have raised this issue now with them 3 times. The most resent was today and by far those treys smelled so bad it was sickening and I had to go to the bathroom and wash my hands to get rid of the rotten sock smell before eating.   If Cafe Rio makes an effort to fix this issue I'll change my review. But as of now I'll no longer eat here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I became very sick from eating the chicken and pork tamales(Thursday's Special) and the steak quesadilla . May have been food poisoning...Anyone else? Since we arrived near closing time, the food may have been old! Be careful!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, workers, and environment!!! Waiting time long but worth the wait for great tasting fresh food! All food is on point! Tortilla fresh made right in front of you."}
{"text":"This cafe rio is the worst I've been to. The workers are rude & the rice was just so dry, we had to pick out the driest grains."}
{"text":"The worst customer service, EVER!! I will never go back again!! My family and I use to visit this location all the time! The girl at the counter said she didn't know if they had flan after I asked her multiple times (which they ended up having). She tried charging me twice for a chicken quesadilla, they put pico de Gallo in my tortilla soup when I told them I didn't want any. The complaints go on and on!!! This place is TURD!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is one of my favorite Mexican fast food spots.  The portions are large and food is great.  I highly recommend the steak or chicken salads!     A few unusually nice things about Cafe Rio is that they give a free kid's cheese crisp with an adult purchase.  My only complaint is that all they have is a small cheese crisp for a kid's menu.  They also do not have any desserts on the menu.       Their prices range from $5 - 8 per item."}
{"text":"Out of house dressing? No queso? They advertise ultimate drink bar, but have none of their lemonade cooler's filled. When i ask why they're out of everything, they say \"short staffed\".  Horrible!"}
{"text":"I rarely go to Cafe Rio because I like Chipotle. The last time I went to Cafe Rio was probably 3 or 4 years ago.    There was a Bogo coupon, so I decided to go and give it a second try. I got off work at 9, and they close at 10. I arrived there about 9:40. Yes, I was one of those people. There were about 7 or 8 employees working. It actually took me quite a bit to order and leave. I ordered a burrito and a salad with the sweet barbacoa meat. The girl assisting me did ask me if I wanted it enchilada style. It would have been nice to know it was $1 more, which I wasn't aware of until I looked at my receipt when I was at home. I guess they are used to people already knowing that it costs more.....   The food itself wasn't that bad. I do prefer Chipotle style burritos or maybe it's different when you get enchilada style as opposed to regular. My burrito came with the rice, and meat inside. The lettuce and pico de gallo came on the side. I guess it partially is my fault for not being an educated orderer.    Yes, I know it was close to closing time, but I had really bad service. The girl assisting me did not know what she was doing. She was lost, talked to other employees while assisting me. Sorry, but I don't care that you only work closing shifts. I just want my food so I can leave. She left my burrito floating  ( I got it enchilada style.) She then left my salad and burrito just waiting there when it was completed. She didn't even package it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Every other person who handled our order got it wrong, then rolled their eyes at us when we asked them to make it the right way, then then charged us extra for a teaspoon of guacamole and a regular portion of cheese.  Staff were literally throwing food around, then using filthy towels to clean up after themselves.  To top it off, when we later called to speak with the manager, she expressed zero interest in actually fixing the problems, but instead kept insisting that I take a voucher for a free burrito.  I didn't want a free burrito.  I wanted to go to a restaurant with polite, competent staff and a manager who cared to fix problems with her staff."}
{"text":"Customer service is the worst! Every single person there is rude! Their job is to make your order however you like it, but they get mad when you try to make it your own. The girls are talking about their baby's daddy while serving me. Didn't even make eye contact. Just threw the money on the table and not in my hands. I got a salad one time and was pretty stingy with the meat. Gave me like a small pinch of meat. Everyone there seems they hate their job. Well guess what.....A job is a job. Be grateful you even have a job in these economy.  Other than the service.....food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Went in for the 5 dollars off app deal.  The price went from 7 to 2 so it's kinda worth it for that deal only.   The enchilada was iffy."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for years and had excellent service fast and efficient until today! The manager, Brie was very disrespectful and rude to her guests. She was at the register talking with her coworker when I so rudely interrupted her conversation to pay for my food. She continued to mutter words of disgust under her breath. Unfortunately I won't be giving this location my business any longer."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I have been here several times and each time has been very similar. I like the food and concept but when it comes to execution of customer service the star rating falls to one.  Places with food like this are everywhere and customer service is what makes a business stand out. This business does not stand out except in negative ways.  Out of the 12 or so employees working not one was smiling. As we worked our way down the assembly line each employee seemed almost callus or at least not engaged/friendly. There wasn't a \"manager\" or anyone in charge \"leading\" this team to success and as a result, in my opinion, they failed.   The biggest failure was in the dining room. All of the shift focus on this day was on the \"line\". No one was looking at service through the customer eye. Tables were dirty and trash cans were overflowing. The regular coke was \"out\" and it took 20 mins from the time I sat down before an employee cleared tables and did a trash run.   All in all I would say the result on this day was predictable. Without leadership, fast food employees will achieve the goals established (none)...."}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever had was the coconut shrimp tacos that were a Tuesday Special, and they were divine. the hand made fresh tortillas are awesome too."}
{"text":"A cut above other fast Mexican concepts, Cafe Rio is always a favorite place of mine to eat at.  When you enter the line the first thing you will see are the fresh tortillas being made by hand.  While 3-4 will be spinning on the wheel getting delicious, the rest will be in some form from dough mixing in a blender to partitioned lumps being prepared for the heat.  The end result is always fantastic.  The pork barbacoa is the signature meat here and its a favorite with most I know who eat here regularly.  It has a very unique sweetness to it that goes well in any form you choose to have it, be it a salad, burrito or even nachos.  You really can't go wrong with the other choices but the pork barbacoa offers the most memorable experience.  They have mild, medium and hot sauces here for your dish.  The mild is basically salsa verde and as a tomatillo fan its something I opted for often.  The medium is an oddly sweet but warm sauce, and the hot is your typical red.    If you like a side dish, the chips and queso is also very good.  The queso is given in a very nice quantity along with a metric ton of fresh chips that aren't too salty.  Holds up well if you get it to go as the cheese will still be very hot when you get it to your table.  If you opt to order extra meat the entire staff will yell out \"Exxxxxxtra Meat!!\" which can be fun.  My favorite meal from here would be the fire grilled steak burrito, enchilada style with extra meat. with chips and queso on the side.  Mild sauce for a tomatillo day, hot sauce for a flavor enhancer mood.    They also offer a loyalty punch card program, so if you frequent it you will get free meals periodically which is a plus."}
{"text":"For the amount of money you pay for a salad, I was hoping for better service. The people working the line were friendly but the cashier was extremely rude and unwelcoming to my kids and I. You get better service and save money by going to an actual mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I've been eating at different Cafe Rio locations in the valley for years and have filled no less than three of their stamp cards so I'm not new to their set-up. My bf and I always get extra pico on our salads and we've never been denied this request until today. The older Hispanic lady who helped me just ignored me when I told her TWICE that I need extra pico on my two salads. Is this some kind of a cost-cutting strategy? If it is it's very ineffective cuz it's actually more costly to lose a customer over an extra scoop of pico de Gallo. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The shredded chicken salads at café rio are the BEST!! The quality of food here is amazing and the staff is friendly here!!"}
{"text":"Worst cafe rio I've ever been to.  Slow service.  Employees are incredibly slow.  They're also rude-whoever manages this place has no clue how to drive customer service.  On this trip I ordered chips and guacamole see the pic of what I got.  I've been here enough to know this isn't right-totally ripped off."}
{"text":"\"Nobody goes there, it's too crowded.\"  Darn, I like the food at Cafe Rio.  Big servings, wonderful flavor, quality ingredients.  And the freshly made tortillas are beyond compare.  It's just wonderful.  If I were to rate the place purely on the food, it would be 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I've got to knock off a star for other factors.  First, even though I said big servings were a positive, they're also a negative.  I have no idea how single people eat here.  The wife and I always split a meal because there's no way we could each eat one of anything not on the child's menu.  Yet, we see bajillions of these young, thin women in there with meals bigger than their heads.  I have no idea how they do it.  The second negative is that the prices are high.  Yes, big servings of excellent food made with quality ingredients will cost.  But, this is a place where you stand in a long line to order your food and eat it from an aluminum bowl/plate with plastic utensils.  Because we always split a single entree, the prices are fine for us.  But, again, for lone individuals, I think it's a lot of money (but, then, I'm old).  Then, there's the environment:  the place is usually jammed with people and it's unbelievably loud.  It's just an uncomfortable place.  So, wonderful food with a few other factors that knock it down by a star.  Still, a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"I've NEVER been to a restaurant where they can't serve over half of the items on their menu 30 minutes before they close because they CHOOSE to stop making food! We arrived at 8:30pm on a Sunday, and they have a close time of 9pm. We waited in line for 12 minutes before we were next to be serviced. The employee told us there were only some ingredients left for certain bowls. I've worked in retail and food service, and I've never closed up shop over 30 minutes early without being able to support customers for that remaining amount of time. Otherwise, we would close early so that we don't waste customers time standing in line! Wtf"}
{"text":"Don't even call to pick up! They put your order in last minute! And they wait till all the customers in line are gone to complete your order. WHAT A JOKE!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is by far one of the best Mexican  fast food restaurants  out. I love everything they have there, the shredded meats  to the grilled meatss. Services fast , food is good."}
{"text":"Not so happy with this location right now. I went to get the special of the day (coconut shrimp) only to be \"greeted\" by an employee I had to speak too first. I walked  and she looked at me as though I had a third eye, so I said \"hello\" to her. I ordered the shrimp and they are out of the mango salsa that comes with it.. Only the main topping.. No big deal. Then, I decide to treat myself to dessert, key lime pie. They're put of pie. I then inquire the chocolate flan. Guess what? Don't have that either and no other desserts are made yet. It's 3pm. Alright.. Get home and try the rice. HARD and crunchy. They need to get it together! I even asked when they would have desserts for if there is a time of day things that I think should also be made are made. The cashier said anytime, just not now. Awesome. Thank you.."}
{"text":"I love chipotle, but when i ate at this place i could say its way better than chipotle, the Barbacoa Salad is dying for.. Now Ive been going back here since my friend introduced me to this place. Very neat , Clean and good service.. most of all its cheap and its good... I recommend this restaurant !!!!!"}
{"text":"I actually got a call from the Area Coach, Umberto, on 4/18/17.  He called based on my negative survey I had submitted.  He apologized for our experience and offered to send a certificate for 2 free meals to my email the following day.  He also said to call him directly if we encounter any problems.  The next day rolls around and still nothing from him.  I called his cellphone and it kept going to a mailbox that hadn't been set up yet so I call the store.  You would think he would have seen the missed calls and called me back.  I called this store and they said he'll be back in a few days.  I call again in a few days and apparently just missed him.  Nine days had passed and I still could't get in contact with him.  I had waited on hold for 25 mins today only to be told to call back in 30 mins because they were busy.  I waited and called back.  The employee was rude and put the phone down to get Umberto.  I heard someone in the background say he had left.  Instead of the employee telling me this, she just hung up on me.  Now this becomes more about principle than two free meals.  I ended up calling their corporate office and spoke to Elaine.  She was very apologetic and instantly credited my account for the meals.  She also advised the Regional Manager.  For an Area Coach to not keep his word is not acceptable and reflects poorly on the company he represents.  I will not frequent this location for a very long time, if ever.  I will try the location on Durango since they have better Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"We've been to this location twice and each time received much better service than the Blue Diamond location.  Their speed of service was pretty good and the employees were much friendlier.  The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is that they always want to charge a $1 more for enchilada style which we never get.  You would never know you're being charged for it until you see the receipt, unless you figure out the tax amount on your phone's calculator beforehand.  This must be consistent amongst the stores as Blue Diamond also tries to charge it.  The portion size is great but sometimes their salsa fresca can be very salty."}
{"text":"One star is actually more star than this restaurant deserves.  I ordered online with a pick up time for 7:30 pm. Well, got there at 7:29, walked up to the pick up line. Esmeralda was the cashier at the time, she asked for my name clicked on the screen then yelled my name. Someone yelled out and said we dont have that order. She then told me my order isn't ready. (Now mind you that this is the second time my online order wasn't ready at the specified time THEY gave me; 1st time shame on you, 2nd time shame on me-won't be going back to that restaurant). I told her about this being the second time and I if they would offer something to me for my inconvenience such as a discount,  free drinks, free appetizer? All I got in response was im not authorized to do that. I asked \"well, who is?\". Esmeralda said the manager. I proceeded to ask to speak to the manager.  The manager walked over and I explained the situation.  He said the PICK UP time was when the order was released to them. Are you serious?  Do you honestly think I am that naive that I would believe that explanation?  I said \"No, its the PICK UP time, not order release time!\". I then asked for his name, Geraldo.  Then asked him for the corporate office number. He pointed to the survey number on my receipt. Ummm that's not the corporate office number Mr Manager. But don't worry I googled the number and will be calling them first thing Tuesday morning since Monday is a Holiday.  After waiting for several minutes my order was done. I'm sure it wasnt up to standard.  The portions were smaller than normal & the quality of the prep was sad. Im sure its because I asked for the corporate office number. Then while Esmeralda check over my order she said it was all there. I then double checked her and sure enough they were missing one of my orders! Last night was the last night I will be spending my hard earned money at that restaurant.  I will drive 5 miles more to get better service at another Cafe Rio, thank you! Oh, lastly. ..not ONCE did Esmeralda or Geraldo apologize for anything!  Thanks for the best customer service, NOT!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing but customer service is the worst I've ever seen. They mess up and are rude every time I go. Once I ordered to go and they told me 20 min. I go 20 min later and they said it never got made and asked me what I got again. They made both orders wrong and when I told them they had it wrong the girl rolled her eyes and remade it very slowly. I recommend the one on greenfield and Williams field. Food is put together better and everyone there is awesome. Really upset I don't live next to that one anymore."}
{"text":"This location is TERRIBLE! The food is just ok, but the staff is so rude and miserable! My husband, my son ,and myself went into this location to eat around 4:00 today. The girl behind the counter making the food was so rude! I'm sorry you don't like your job but come on!! She was rude from the time she asked want I wanted to the time she basically threw my husbands quesadilla! Then while we were eating I saw her go over to the trash and push it down with here bare hands and then go back behind the counter and not even wash her hands! So gross! That's the same person that just made my family's food! It's not the first time we have been to this location and been treated like crap... I will never ever be going to this horrible location again!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested we go to Cafe Rio instead of the sushi joint we had planned for late lunch/early dinner.   I'm so glad we went here instead because  I would never have discovered this place that offers some seriously BOMB (as in good!) mexican food.    Their portions are humongous so my friend and I decided to split our orders.  He got the Pork Barbacoa Burrito and I got the Grilled Fire Steak Salad.  The Pork Barbacoa is heaven!  Wow!  Sooo freakin good! So good, I almost wished I got that instead of the salad but I digress.  The salad was delicious as well but next time I'll stick to the Pork Barbacoa."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. First time I had the enchiladas. Taste was alright but the were barely warm and tortillas were raw but for fast Mexican food it was decent. Went back a second time and this time I  had a steak burrito. Once again the temp of the food is borderline cold. The kick though is that for a steak burrito and drink with no side other than sour cream and guacamole will cost you $16 and some change. I will never go back for this sub par food. If it was priced better you could justify the semi warm mediocre food. I recommend you try other places."}
{"text":"To the lady in front of me.  When everyone in line is looking at you, you're causing a scene.  The staff handled her demands very well and kept the line moving.  Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Really good food. I recommend getting the burrito! You can choose what you want in it. If you are near this restaurant, I recommend going to it!!"}
{"text":"Placing an online order or even calling an order in is a complete waste of time. Was quoted a pick up time of 12:35 (receipt states it will be ready at 12:25) by 12:45 the order hadn't even been started, finally was deliver food at 12:50. They said \"it got busy\". This is not the first time this has happened! To top it off the order was WRONG! Ordered spicy pork enchiladas with sour cream and the side and was given chicken enchiladas with sour cream on top. The food is good, but this location needs to get it together, poor service :("}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because Cafe Rio is my absolute favorite burrito, BUT I must warn you to stay on them.   I have ordered the same thing for several years, a burrito with hot sauce.  This most recent time in, I noticed as they were pouring it, it looked more orange when it's typically red.   After the first bite I knew something was off.  I asked the cashier who then looked at the sauce and also noted it looking thinner than normal, so she asked the chef.   The response she came back with was that they were low on that salsa, so they had watered it down to stretch it out!!   Truthfully, it would have been better practice to probably run out of it as opposed to making burritos for customers that either get thrown away or refunded AND thrown away.   The burritos are normally delicious.  Just be on your guard."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes in line because my fiancé wanted to try it and we had a coupon. He said \"they'll never get my money again.\" The seasonings and flavors are bland and boring. It definitely wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"I don't say this about many places, but this place was disgusting. I got the chicken enchiladas and the entire plate was drenched in their medium chile sauce that tasted like sweet and sour sauce, making it inedible. After eating what I could of it, I had a bad stomachache the rest of the day.   Save yourselves and head over to Chipotle which is in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic but the place has serious issues when it comes to ordering for pick up.  Called in a lunch order for the office... put on hold for 7 minutes. Placed the order for pick up at 11:05 and was told it would be ready to pick up at 11:30. Show up at 11:30 and they have not even started the order!!  Waited around with multiple other people who had also ordered for pick up who had the same issue. Some of them just ended up walking out because the wait was so long. Manager says they are understaffed but no real apology. Most places would at least offer a free drink for the inconvenience.  Didn't get out of there until 11:55. Food was delicious as always but placing a simple order over the phone for pick up and how unorganized  they are is ridiculous.  Total chaos inside this place and they really need some organization skills when it comes to go orders over the phone.  Food makes up for it though if you pay attention to making sure the order is right."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are amazing!!!!! Also love the fish tacos. I wish they had them everyday. You can't go wrong with their salad. Delicious guacamole."}
{"text":"Food was great and affordable.  I recommend the pork barbacoa which had a sweet tangy bbq flavor."}
{"text":"Great food! The only place in Phoenix that I know of that has homemade tortillas.  The tortillas combined with the excellent steak make for one of the best burritos in town.  The evening rush gets a little busy but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I recently called this location with a last minute order for 15 people (my bunko group) and they were able to fill it within 30 minutes!  I was desperate and the kitchen manager got on the phone and helped me with my order.  The food was very good and everyone really liked it.  They definitely saved me as I had totally forgotten the time and needed good, fresh food quickly."}
{"text":"Loved the coconut shrimp tacos I had for lunch, so we decided to get take out for the family for supper. My kids ran out and came back with only one order of coconut as they were out! We ended up with the cajun tacos, good, but not as good as the coconut! Special of the day, they should have offered us coupons or something, or at least put a sign on the door! :("}
{"text":"Never had a worse experience at a Cafe Rio ever and I've been eating there for over 10 years. Walked in at 5:50 and didn't get my food until 6:27 and there were FIVE people in front of me in line. Staff was openly complaining about having to work on Halloween, picking up stuff off the ground with same gloves as handling food, ran out of all kinds of food by 6:30, kept burning things, food was scattered all over the place. They even let people come in the door about 6:15 and then told them at 6:30 they were closed. Whoever owns this one should never be allowed to own another one!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has good food, this location however is not  place I would EVER recommend! I went in today on my lunch hour to get a quesadilla. They put the meat on a taco tortilla and put it on the grill. The next guy in line didn't even know what I had ordered! This was after waiting 30 minutes to order my food! The next guy in line didn't seem to care when he said \"oh, you wanted a big quesadilla?\" I was ordering from the adult menu and was by myself, so there should have been no question what size I was ordering. He then shrugged and said \"Well I guess we can remake it for you\". This kind of customer service should never be tolerated. I will not eat at this location again and I recommend if anyone likes Cafe' Rio, DON'T go to the West Sahara and Ft. Apache location!  As far as their catering goes they obviously can't handle the volume of business they have at that location, much less any catering orders as we have to order catering at my work from a different location just to get the orders correct!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a while and I probably won't be back. I remember it being more customer friendly. I understand that its busy but there's no reason to rush your customers into an order then make them wait a few minutes while your trying to figure out the orders of the people already being helped. Before I knew it the employees decided what I wanted in my burritos and they were all wrapped up going through the oven cause I wanted them enchilada style. That's when I was told that they only put the \"toppings\" on the side now. Every other time I've been here I've been able to choose what goes into my order. I just wanted some lettuce and tortilla strips in my burrito. Feeling confused I just went along with it cause I had a two for one coupon and was just looking for a quicker deal for dinner. Saving a little bit of money it still came out to more than twenty bucks. With the food not being prepared how I wanted it and feeling unvalued as a customer is leaving me pretty disappointed in my choice of place for dinner"}
{"text":"We love cafe rio and we've been to the original cafe rios in Utah a million times. When we went here it tasted like a different restaurant.. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cafe Rio.  The food is always fresh and love the just made tortillas.  The lines can get pretty long, but its well worth the wait!  The salmon is my favorite.  Excellent.  They have a repeat customer card so after 10 visits you get a free meal.  I've filled up a few of those already :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered salads to go twice from this new location. Both times, the serving of toppings and meat were much less compared to normal servings when we have gone (many times) to other locations. Gave you a second chance and you skimped on us again super disappointed!"}
{"text":"This will be my last time eating here.  The mediocre food is overpriced.   The only reason it has more than 1 star is the employees were friendly.  2 enchiladas, a quesadilla, 2 regular drinks...$25.  Better to go to a nicer restaurant and pay the same."}
{"text":"This location always smells like PURE SHIT. They need to learn how to clean their drains.  Staff here is all college students who need an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a step up in comparison to other fast Mexican food places.  I especially like the Tostada and now they have it with Salmon.  I would just skip adding the rice.   The chips are light and addictive.  Always tastes fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"The dining room is so dirty.  It's always busy and there is never anybody wiping the tables.  The soup is Luke warm and the help doesn't seem to know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible service. It just seemed disorganized and messy. I had to wait an additional 15 minutes just to have them make me another steak burrito. It's like my burrito got lost on the way out of their oven."}
{"text":"Could not belive our experience last night!  Went to the local Cafe Rio about 9:15 on Friday and the place was not very busy.  When I went to get my beverage, both the horchata and strawberry drink dispensers were empty.  Not even a spurt for the fountain sprayer.  And  this is despite most of the staff walking by the empty dispenser as they got their own drinnks and took their breaks.  I told the cashier that the horchata machine was empty and I would like some.  She said \"ok\", but after nearly 10 minutes there was still no horchata in the machine.  When I approached the cashier to see if they would be filling the machine, she SHOUTED at me, \"I KNOW\"  Could not believe (a) that they would let the drink machines run out while the restaurant was still open and (b) that the staff were so poorly trained that they would shout at customers.  Tenty minutes after arriving and as we were finishing our meal, they finally put some horchata in the machine.  As I went to get a sip before leaving, it was readily apparent that no one cared enough to also fill the strawberry drink.  Food may be convenient, but service and training are certainly lacking.  Pollo Loco started very well but customer service after the were sold by Winchells made them a much-lesser pick.  Afraid Cafe Rio is going the same direction.  Great when they only had a few stores, but sadly they are totally losing control as they rapidly expand."}
{"text":"Don't ever order online here they suck. And on top of all their mistakes they don't give a damn or acknowledge any mistakes. They mess up orders that are black and white and straight to the point. I didn't even get an I'm sorry we messed up. I just got an oh. Yes I got a refund and I'll stick to the blue diamond location."}
{"text":"I got sick from this food, like food poisoned and got a taco on taco tuesday, a regular drink and beans and pinto for $4.25. The waitress forgot my drink (good job....NOT) so I had to ask for it myself. The food was tasty but I FREAKIN GOT FOOD POISONED!!!!!!  No thank you. Bye!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  I reccommend the steak tacos.  YUM!  However, I only gave it 3 stars because the organization is crap!  You seriously have to repeat your order 5 times before you check out.  Since my husband usually goes and gets a table with the kids and I do the ordering, that means I repeat 5 orders 5 times.  You do the math!  Im exhausted by the end of the line!!  Just kidding.....It's just more frustrating than anything."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is my favorite restaurant. However, the people who work at this location are a little weird.   There's this guy who always sweats and it grosses me out. Also they are skimpy with everything on my tostada. GIVE ME MORE BABY!!!!!   There is this one girl who works at the register and she is a gem. I think her name starts with a D. She gave me a receipt to fill out a survey and get a free dessert. And she hand delivered it to me!! Such a sweet girl!!!!!  Anyways cafe rio is Awesome   Oh also before I forget they play annoying music in there and I think that should be turned off completely. Too much annoying pop"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ordered here as I heard good things about the food.  I placed a web catering order for 30 people and from start to finish Cafe Rio was outstanding.   Within 10mins of placing the order online I received a confirmation email from an actual person, not an auto response email.   I needed to change the pickup time a few days later, and received an email back from Alexus within minutes.    They called me that morning to let me know everything would be on time.   The Taco Catering Package with Beef / Chicken was amazing.   Comes with everything you need.    Highly recommend it.   I will definitely be using them for my next party."}
{"text":"The hours clearly say that it closes at 10pm on Sunday.  I showed up at 915pm and the doors were locked and one of the employees said that they are closed... BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Even the take out was awesome. Thought it wouldn't taste so fresh or get soggy, but as always the food rocks. I love the chicken tacos & the queso dip!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that Cafe Rio doesn't know how to accommodate vegans.  I ordered a vegetarian, single enchilada with no cheese. The menu specifically stated that vegetarian options get guacamole, double rice, and double beans, yet they told me I would be charged for double rice and double beans.  So I'm finally about to eat my vegan enchilada, and guess what I found when I cut it in half: Cheese.  I think I'll just stick with Chipotle since they are more consistent with vegan orders."}
{"text":"Always so slow...ordered a to go order was supposed to be ready at 6:00 it's now 6:30 and I still don't have food. They have one person working the take out section making food and ringing people up..."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Super fast, but with quality fresh food!! Walk in, order, and eat!!    I love the salads, the fresh made in front of you tortillas, even my 12 year old loves it, and thats a tall order!   Try the fresh horchata and mango papaya juice to go with your tasty meal!!   You can also order easy take out or catering.. the ONLY thing I wish they had.. was delivery!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here when I'm in town.  During lunch and dinner time there is a line near the door.  It's advisable to come before or after the rush.  The pork salads are absolutely amazing!! You cannot go wrong ordering that (unless you don't like pork)! I went on a Sunday afternoon (1ish) and ordered a pork burrito.  The line wasn't too bad and the young man who made my burrito was patient to make it the way I wanted (usually they are rushing because the line is so long).  The one rude lady is the Spanish speaking middle aged women who will talk to customers in English and start saying unnecessary comments to her coworkers in Spanish, definitely did not appreciate that.  All in all it was a good experience.  Also, always remember to stamp your card (frequent customer card) before you leave.  On to the next   Xoxo"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Cafe Rio for years. My family and I would always stop at the Cafe Rio in St. George, Utah  When in the area and the food has always been fresh and consistent in flavor and quality.  However, here In Las Vegas it's been hit and miss at this location and the location on West Lake Mead. The salad lettuce is usually floating in water and often times they are out of food in the metal bins.  I really have enjoyed eating at Cafe Rio and sadly may not continue to dine here any longer as I can't eat another salad that has 1/4 inch of water at the bottom and the tortilla is water logged by the time I reach the bottom of my salad. I'm grossed out!  Sometimes the food and service is great other times it is absolutely dismal. When I'm hungry that's not a gamble I'm willing to take."}
{"text":"So let me start of by saying how pleased I was with the staff here.  I think Zac was the man who helped me.  I was traveling through town in my swishy camo pants and was craving some authentic Mexican cuisine.  I live in California and as far as fast food goes we only have del taco and taco bell.  After my visit I wished that California will get some more locations more up north rather than in the LA market.  Zac is freaking Legend! thanks for my great first experience with Cafe Rio.  I am going to make sure to visit every time I pass through!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly.. food was yummy, but it was cold. I got the daily special which came with a small fountain drink. Sweet pork enchiladas. Yum.. just wish they were warmer."}
{"text":"A lot of people seem to be coming here to complain about a restaurant that literally JUST opened 6 weeks ago. As with any new restaurant opening there are going to be employee training issues and other kinks to work out before they get things right.  I just ate here for the first time yesterday and I can honestly say I was actually impressed. I went in with low expectations thinking \"Oh great this is another Chipotle..\" which tastes like crap, but no, the food was actually pretty good. I had the Habanero/Hatch Chili Chicken burrito with rice, pinto beans and cheese enchilada style with guacamole on top. I ate the entire thing! The girls behind the counter were really nice and made sure our food was exactly the way we wanted it. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Café Rio but not this location!  Unfortunately, this is the closest location to my house so we literally have a debate in our house before going there if we really want to deal with the crappy service/not drive or drive to another location.  There is a person that works there and his name is BUD and I was appalled by his attitude and actions during my recent and most likely last visit to this Café Rio.  This grown man actually shoulder shoved and grabbed the rice spoon out of the hand of the young lady who was preparing my order!  He did it again when she reached for the bean spoon!  It took everything in me not to say something/I didn't trust what I might have said in that moment, I just wanted to hug this poor employee.  He didn't speak, apologize or anything...it was as though that was an accepted practice.  Not sure who BUD is or his role in the store, but this man brings a bad energy to the environment and harassing/treating co-workers with disrespect is not ok under any circumstance.  Please corporate management, fix this store so we/the customers can enjoy the food again."}
{"text":"There is really great customer service at this location. Every time I've been in there they've been very helpful and generous. When they didn't have the meat that I wanted they offered me double of the more expensive meat without additional charge and gave me 50% off and a free drink.  They were very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is OK. I went there today for the taco Tuesday special. Not a bad deal. But then I asked for a side of their house dressing. They charged me $1 for a side of dressing. Then I realized I could have gotten a smaller side for 50 cents, but was never made aware. From now on, I plan on ordering the small side of dressing after I've paid for my meal with my Visa. Then I will pay for the petty 50 cent charge separately on my Visa again, in hopes that they have to pay nearly the same amount or more in transaction fees. Greedy bastards."}
{"text":"Food has usually been good,  but today we decided to order dessert to take home. Guess it was our fault for thinking at 8pm  the food will still be fresh, well good luck with that. The fish looked day old, the chicken was dry, asked to cook more steak and was told their done cooking for night, I then asked what time they close, was told 11. So I gave up and ordered shredded chicken since it's in juice and can't be dry. Got home and learned our Fresh desserts were from 5 days ago. Soooo....If you like old food, over priced, THIS IS YOUR PLACE.  Oh and wanna see biggest joke, look how my key lime pie was wrapped. Last $$$ I drop here."}
{"text":"So here's the deal. I've been to Café Rio four times since they opened. I'm not big on fast Mexican but found the food at Café Rio far superior to chipotle or Qdoba.  Yes there is a slight weight but I think the flavors of the food are very good. Each is distinct and very flavorful, though hot there is not really hot. The problem with this place is that two of the times I was there the food was basically room temperature. Temperature of the food is so low that I have considered contacting the health department because I suspect it is not being held at a hot enough temperature. If they can fix this problem, they'll have a repeat customer in me."}
{"text":"Experience was horrible this place was so packed you think they would have enough staff to make orders, check out and have at least one person out on the floor cleaning. That was just the start, out of the 4 things I ordered they one had 1. They were out of horchata, out of pico de gallo and out of tres leche. Horrible and unacceptable"}
{"text":"one of my favorite new spots! barbacoa salad is delicious and the tortiallas are homemade! yummy tres leches cake too!"}
{"text":"Damn this place was soo good I can't even Thug First them. Sweet Barbacoa salad is meannnn good. Oh wait. Thug First. How the dude gonna ask me if I wanted chips on my salad After he R.I.P'd my greens with them lmao. Other than that this place is on some JayZ \"Chipotle, We off that\" typa flavor. Plus. The Ice Cream shop next door is official!"}
{"text":"I walked in about 9:45pm last night. People were still inside eating ( at that time it's usually a good thing). There was a menu in the walk way which was convenient. I ordered 2 chicken taco plate with black beans and wild rice. The added all the condiments I requested  (kinda like ordering from Subway or Chipotle) I also ordered chips and salsa. My order was to go. I'm not sure if my rice & beans were already cold or if the drive home made them cold nevertheless they were in fact cold, it was disappointing but my tacos were still warm. The chips and salsa were delicious and I have already recommend a friend to this location and will be back."}
{"text":"This cafe rio isn't too bad.  The inside is extremely cramped especially during busy hours.  The line moves in a decent pace like most cafe rios.  My good has always been made correctly and taste fine.  Chicken salad with shredded lettuce and house dressing + everything else is the best."}
{"text":"The only thing I really get here is the salad with grilled steak.  It's pretty big and like that you can get it with shredded lettuce.  Other than that, everything else I have tried has not been as good as Chipotle's offerings."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is my favorite of these style places. I usually get the pork barbacoa tacos. Burritos and salads are good. Check out this place ( any location really).    My only complain, is the wait times sometimes during rush times. Im patient, and I totally understand its a popular place, but why does it seem like chipoltle, qdoba, baja, or any other similar style place with similiar lines seem to move faster."}
{"text":"Great food awful service!  Even the manager kind of had a \"whatever\" attitude!  Gonna have to go to another Cafe Rio from now on."}
{"text":"Love cafe rio, but wont be back to this location again! Lines are sloooooow youre food is cold by time you get to the cashier, if they even have the food. Four out of five times at night between 5/6 (dinner time) they are out of meat? I work in the restaurant business and this shouldn't be occuring daily. On a good note the mean girls that used to work on the line, i havent seen for a while:) Tonight was the tenth chance i gave them. Here i come Stephanie st! Bye Horizon"}
{"text":"Burritos are very good and enchilada style is included, but the line is often slow and long and the prices are a bit high.  Works as an occasional break from Chipotle, but runs about $4 more for a family of 4."}
{"text":"Good food, service isn't that great though. Could be a lot more efficient. Costa vida keeps things moving faster and keeps tables clean. The last few times we've been to cafe rio there isn't a clean table... several open but all with bits of food scattered over them. And that's even happened at times they're not busy. Annoying to have to track down an employee to wipe down all the dirty tables and wait to eat my food until they get around to it... definitely makes me think twice about going here over costa vida. But sometimes I think I like their salad dressing better."}
{"text":"Got hooked on this place back in Utah. Barbacoa salad......Yum! Grilled steak burrito enchilada style ......Yum!  Just make sure you check your order before leaving. The Eastern location has a habit of wrecking family take out night by forgetting sides and incorrectly making/packing orders.   Tip; Kids Menu:  -They offer bean and cheese burritos for kids that don't like all the privileges of adults, however, you will have to explain that it is possible to do because the cashier is most times oblivious on how to ring it up. Ask for managerial assistance. This goes for other kid items as well."}
{"text":"Thank you for the food poison :) that cheese quesadilla tasted REALLY good coming back up...hadnt been back in a long time because this place is just gross...now i remember why...yes i know it was food poisoning because its the only thing i ate yesterday...Nope..ill save my $10 for a quesadilla elsewhere when i can stomach food again..."}
{"text":"GET THE PORK! Anything with the pork is going to make you happy. Even if you have a minor pork allergy, it's worth it.  I have nothing else to say except drop what you are doing, get your wallet and go eat something with the pork.  P.S. Their homemade tortilla shells they are making while you wait in line are better than....well...you know where I'm going with that.   PORK, TORTILLAS, GO!"}
{"text":"Went Cafe Rio had a wonderful wet burrito with all the fixings plus knowledgable staff to aid in filling you up at a good price"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the worst Cafe Rio in the valley and I typically love the food from this chain. I've given them repeated chances to improve and I'm disappointed with every time I visit. The food prep area is incredibly messy, the crew seems understaffed and over their heads, and they're always out of various menu items. You don't wait until you're actually out of something to start making more...plan ahead! The customers in line, me included, usually get impatient with the poor performance.   I've never seen a manager or anyone that I could identify as a manager and it doesn't seem like they're interested in improving the quality at this location. This consistently poor customer service explains why this location is usually empty during the typical busy times and days.   Come on Cafe Rio, get your sh*t together!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when this Cafe Rio opened. It was so much closer to where I live! But every time I go to this location I am always disappointed. They are ALWAYS out of something. Every. Single. Time.  Their customer service is just sad. They are rude and take forever to help you. One time I waited about thirty minutes to get my food with only two other customers ahead of me. I honestly just drive the extra 15 minutes to the one located on Stephanie. Trust me, the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this location because it is close to our house. We walked in at 6:30 pm and was suprised it was not that busy. We stood in a short line of 10 people and it still took 30 minutes to get our meal. My wife ordered chicken nachos and they were out of chicken and we had to wait for Kevin to cook it. The staff were nice but you can tell they are uninspired and lack direction. Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I almost never write a bad review but last night was my last straw. I love cafe rio, it might be my favorite \"fast\" food. But this location is the worst I've ever been to in my life. Rude, horrible service, and they are always out of everything. They are never prepared for a full day, or half That for that matter. Expect at any given time you'll be in line for 30-1 hr, whether there's 2 people in line or 20."}
{"text":"Like other commenters, I've seen this place make a stark decline over 2015. However, after giving it another try, the staff seemed to be reorganized and much more efficient. I actually called corporate over this store a few times to complain about the staff, but they have definitely shown improvement.  The food is always good and they're accommodating to special requests, which I always appreciate.  I'm glad to see that their newer staff is making an effort to fix the place!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has great food, but TERRIBLE service! Associates are rude, and don't smile, ever. They over charged me for a to-go order I had made, and when I called to speak to the manager, she didn't listen and raised her voice to me! It's the closest location to me, but it's not worth the hassle I get. Its not what you say, it's how you say it."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews unless the customer service is awful, in which this case the service was greatly underwhelming. First off, we come to cafe rio on average of 1 time per week. The service is usually mediocre but we let them have it- the store just opened. However, this time I felt like I was treated like dirt under a rug. Usually when I get a chicken and cheese quesadilla I have noticed it is rather soggy due to the amount of cheese on it and the underdone tortilla. Knowing this from past experiences, I asked the worker if I could get my quesadilla cooked an extra minute longer to make the tortilla crispier on the outside in which she replied \"uhm, I guess. I don't know what you expect- it's melted cheese. It is going to be soggy.\" I was baffled. I most definitely wasn't asking for the world with this one and I was more than polite. I certainly didn't ask for a smirky response. I explained to her that the cafe rio on 83rd and bell Rd was more than happy to do this for me. Upon this, the guy working next to her started laughing and shook his head, muttering indistinguishable remarks under his breath while looking at the other worker. The manager asked him what the issue was and he said \"I guess they want their quesadilla extra crispy.\" He then continued to laugh and whistle while making our food. It was completely rude and uncalled for. I am the easiest person to please but excuse me while I say, if you are in a customer service industry and you make your customer who spends an ample amount of money in your store feel embarrassed, you are doing your job poorly. It is more than the store being new- it is treating your customer as a human being, even if their request seems outstandingly far fetched. It is not that difficult to be nice. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend introduced me to this place and I think it's one of my favorite mexican food places in Gilbert. I've had a few things off the menu (so has my girlfriend). I must say everything has been delicious. The meat is always tender and juicy. If I had to compare it to another place, I'd say it was like chipotle with a bit more of an authentic taste. I recommend the pork burritos ( award winning type of good), but you really can't go wrong with any item at this place."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times and are ALWAYS disappointed.  The service is horrible.  We love the other locations but this one should be avoided at all cost. We were told this is the \"training location\".  I do not consider that an excuse.  Train the employees better before releasing them on the general public!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat there at least once a week and we still haven't had a bad meal. Except for the quesadillas. They're way too greasy. Everything else is very tasty and freshly made."}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle but much better. The place is very busy but its worth the wait.  I had the pork salad and a beef taco, they were both very tasty and fresh.  The place is clean and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"3 stars might seem poor to anyone who has enjoyed Cafe Rio. There was a point where this franchise would have easily been a 5 in my book, as the food has always been delicious, and the staff used to be very friendly. Nowadays, the food remains tasty (I only go for the sweet barbacoa), but everything else is lacking. The service is very slow most nights, even when they aren't busy. They have become increasingly rude and apathetic towards customers, not acknowledging requests or even your presence at times. The atmosphere used to seem fun and lively, but there is dust on everything and it feels less than inviting. Even their drink fountains with their special Mint Lemonade or Jamaica have taken a turn for the worse as their beverage bubbler is never turned on and on multiple occasions the drinks even tasted mildly fermented. I will still go once in a while for my barbacoa burritos, but it makes me sad to say I can't recommend much else about this place."}
{"text":"First of all, the place is cool. Second, the burrito I had was not worth the extras I added (grilled chicken, \"enchilada\" style) I literally had to eat out of my wife's food!   Anyway, on a good note, I absolutely Loved the the chicken salad! Get the House Dressing!   To make things worth, I finished their Horchata! Lol"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Cafe Rio.  They runs rings around all others."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to become impatient with people but today put me over the top. My coworkers put in an email order at 10:45 to be picked up at 12:15. I thought it would be kind to put up their food seeing how I was going to chipotle already and they are right next to each other. I arrive at cafe rio at 12:15 and tell the cashier the names I am picking up for. She then relays those names to the cooks. That was the first red flag. The food should have already been made seeing how my PICK UP time was 12:15. I'm waiting for my coworkers food and it seems like they aren't starting it. The cashier then relays the names two more times to the cooks. Three people behind me are served before my food is even ready. 45 minutes later there it is... My coworkers food. This was easily the worse service I have ever had from a fast food establishment. Never again will I eat at cafe rio let alone do pick up from them. It's forever chipotle gang or die!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had an unfortunate experience at another location.  I called this store and spoke to Veronica and she was so polite and friendly that we decided to give Cafe Rio another try.  She made us feel extremely welcome and we will definitely come back to this location in the future.  Thank you VERONICA for restoring our appreciation for Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has quickly become my favorite place to eat out. The food is great, and the atmosphere is great for families, couples, or groups! Plus, they have Apple Beer!"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious chips and salsa!!!!!! Yummy!!!! But because I was on hold for so long when I tried to cater and then transfered and not correctly and then lied to they only get 4 stars. I'll change in the future if the customer service gets better :)"}
{"text":"I used to live in Utah and this was THE restaurant... \"who wants to get some rio???\" oh yea!  so excited to learn there is one in sunny AZ :)  I Love their salad and the tortilla soup, people complain about the blandness or too much rice/beans but I think these people are rather picky.  Your at cafe rio, way better than taco bell but still not your hispanic friend's mom's kitchen...get over yourselves people the food is good, and the pricing is spot on.  Everyone raves about Chipotle but I think they are so off on this, rio is way better and you shouldn't be such a debby downer on the stuffy seating and having to order in line-it's an experience so go with it.    sorry I think this is the first review I've written where I've shot down other yelpers...sorry guys but everyone just sounded so whiney.  it's good food, go try it and move on with your day :)"}
{"text":"The Barbacoa Pork burritos are awesome. I'm a big dude and just one will keep me full for a long time. While it is not a \"traditional\" Mexican place, the food is outstanding and they have a unique flavor. I swear they put estrogen in the food for the women folk... almost every single girl I know loves the taste of their salads and food. Even when it is busy it is normally fast to get your food, and there is always a place to sit. The best part about Cafe Rio is that they are consistently good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. First time to a cafe rio and felt like a bother to the staff. They were incredibly rude and cold. Will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"If you like horrendous customer service, poor food quality, and walking into a restaurant thinking.... \"Well this could ruin my night\"... head on down to Cafe Rio Gilbert because they will surely take care of you.   Having ate at many Cafe Rio's throughout North America I have always enjoyed the food. I have tried this Cafe Rio on four occasions. The first time I arrived at this location was around dinner on a Friday night... the place was dead. I was thrilled as I was used to waiting in 30 minute lines to order my food at several locations. Little did it take to figure out why......  Every single time the customer service was absolutely horrendous, and there was something wrong about the food (Uncooked Tortilla for a steak salad *literally still dough*, uncooked rice *the kind that crunches when you chew*) Two times, I have thrown away my entire meal without even eating a 1/4 of it. Beyond disappointing. Finally, I had enough and I called in to let them know of my disappointment. The manager agreed to give us a free meal the next time we came in, asked for our names. Even went as far as stating that when we came in the next time we should just give the cashier our name, these were the only instructions we were given.  Well - we came back to give the Cafe Rio Gilbert another shot (first mistake). As we went through the line we informed the cashier that our name and that we had a free meal on record. This resulted in the cashier asking, \"how?\" When we explained why, the cashier walked away from us mid sentence and started to speak to another employee in Spanish directly in front of us. At the end of it they asked if we had our receipt from the previous visit. We did not due to the previous conversation regarding the free meal with the manager. When we tried to explain we were cut off again and ignored as they went back to speaking Spanish in front of us.  Eventually the lady quickly tried to hand us our bag and said \"here\". The thing is we had other meals we needed to pay for and our order was not complete. When finally went to leave the cashier told us that we should of brought our receipt...   My question to this is why? To show we made a prior purchase at Cafe Rio? I had online statements that can show that directly on my phone. Customer Service dissatisfactions are generally documented and monitored internally. This is how a business should be ran. You track these concerns to see if the restaurant is losing its way. Customer dissatisfaction is the first alarm in a location being in trouble.... apparently here, that alarm is not available.... along with its customer service, and food quality.   This all being stated.... the customer service at the Baskin-Robbins next door is outstanding."}
{"text":"Food was ok. . Sauces were sweet.  Tortillas made fresh.  Staff however was horrible. . They could care less what question you had.  Prepared multiple  meals wrong in our group of 10.  Group in dront was there firat time there staff provided no help and had no patience for questions.  Just wanted to rush people through and the place was not busy but dirty.  Tables needed to be wiped down. Drink station was a mess, lemonade fountains were empty and were never addressed for the whole time we were there.   Sad to see . . No reason to come back.  Plenty of other places right there with more to offer"}
{"text":"Great place and delicious food. It tastes great. Try different Mexican foods like enchiladas and huge burritos.  I like the mild sauce when they ask to add it to the meal."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but this is a terribly run business. Horribly understaffed. Stood in line for 35 minutes, and then once we ordered it took another ten minutes because the staff was so uncoordinated. They also make their kitchen staff stand in line I get food, which is inconvenient to customers and disrespectful to employees."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Rubios and Chipotle are so much better. The food line is a mess, no one seems to wipe down the food line and loose food is everywhere. The dining area wasn't being maintained, dirty tables and overflowing trash. The soft drinks line was very wet. Overall the flavor of the food was decent but the poor sanitation is an issue for me. Maybe they were short that one employee who was responsible for cleanup tonight but maybe not."}
{"text":"I agree with many others that this location is often out of many items.  I have been eating at Cafe Rios for almost 20 years and not once have I ever received such a sad looking salad with about 10 pieces of ICEBERG lettuce. Whoever does the inventory and orders supplies needs a new job.  Because I am pretty sure they ran to the grocery store next door and picked out the saddest looking lettuce they could find. I waited 30 minutes for my to go order that was given away to someone else, and I was shorted change by the cashier."}
{"text":"If they could just be consistent I could give more stars. It's complete yin/yang here. The gal that makes the tortillas, she is the most consistent. (Delicious by the way) but the people that plate the food seem to lack training in what the Cafe Rio standard portion size is. I say, go at lunch time. About every 3rd person in line gets screwed. Hope you aren't that person.  if you are lucky, great portions. If your not, well, you'll be upset when you see the plate in front as well as behind you."}
{"text":"Do not order online for this place.  They are unorganized and it took 25 minutes longer to get our food than promised."}
{"text":"Don't feel like they put enough yummies in their burritos. Meat, cheese and salsa doesn't cut it. Wish you could add sour cream, beans, lettuce, etc. Sadly, we won't return."}
{"text":"Tasty food - I love their sweet pork!  The line moved a bit slowly but that was the only downside."}
{"text":"The food at cafe rio is good but the customer service is horrible.the employees here are very rude to paying customers.i would not recommend the Gilbert location.i hope the management can redirect the employees on customer service....I give great customer service to people when I'm at work so I expect the same when I am spending my hard earned money."}
{"text":"I love that I can place an order by phone or through their website. I also love that there is a wheat tortilla option and kids get a free quesadilla. The other night I placed a phone order asking for one shredded chicken enchilada on wheat and somehow I ended up with two enchiladas in regular tortillas, I was a little upset about that since the guy on the phone repeated my order back the way I had ordered it and I still ended up paying for an enchilada that I knew I would not be able to eat. The food is really filling and always makes my mouth water at the very thought of it. And I love getting a free meal after filling up my stamp card."}
{"text":"This location just opened and i'm really sad to say but I will never go to this location again even though it is the closest one from my work.  I ordered online for pick up and found that all the orders were incorrect... Sides we asked for were not included, or wrong ones given.  Sides we paid for, was incorrect.  Sides we requested to be removed was still included.  Meat was not seasoned like the one i'm used to eating (Gilbert location).  We paid for extra meat on 2 orders and didn't get it.  Worst of all, I called the location and told them of my issue and the Falicia (sorry if spelling is wrong) transferred me to the manager who answered then put me on \"hold\" but I can hear breathing sounds and such and after that no one rea-answered the call... I called again and Falicia answered again and told her of what just happened and she took my info for a manager to return my call and still I have not heard back.  Completely unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"I have given this place multiple chances. Each visit was worst than the one before. Well this is the last time that I will be going to this place.  The whole process takes an extremely long time even when there are two people in front of you in line. They always mess up someone's order. By the time your food makes it to the cash register, it's been sitting there for about 20 minutes and is cold. The food itself is not worth the bad experience."}
{"text":"The taste and flavor of the food at Cafe Rio is 3 or 4 Star. I am giving them 1 star for their customer service and accuracy of filling orders. The issues I experienced were: 1. I ordered grilled chicken. They were out for the day at 3:30 in the afternoon. 2. I ordered and paid for an extra flour tortilla on the side, I received a flour tortilla on the side and didn't have one under my salad. 3. I ordered shredded lettuce, no shredded lettuce. 4. I verbalized I had a $10 off coupon, I did not get my discount. And my purchase was not counted to give me more points. I hope some Improvements can be made at this establishment."}
{"text":"Do not go here for late night dinner hours. They stay open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays however, I went around 10:15pm, and by then they had stopped making any type of fresh food.   The beans were being scraped from the bottom of the tin and there was little to no guacamole; so the worker pulled a tin of turned-brown guacamole from the fridge storage and tried to scrape the brown part off the top and mix it with what was left and then added a little salsa for some sort of half-assed leftovers. By the time I'd seen the \"guacamole\" she was going to give me I was about ready to leave but just declined it altogether. (And they still had 45 minutes of service left.)   Dear Cafe Rio,  Don't stay open late if you can't serve your customers the same as if they had been there at 5pm (which I have several times before). My late night meal was not \"a masterpiece.\"  I'll be going to Zaba's or Chipotle for a freshly made late night dinner from now on."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was dismal. They rush you through the line expecting that you know exactly how it works even if you have never been there. If you ask a question they look at you like you're a bother, and don't take the time to explain how their menu works. The bathrooms were in bad shape and there was no changing table. Not sure if we will return. Overall not happy."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time with this pathetic place. You'll wait in line and they won't have the meat you want. If they don't it's ether wait 15-30 minutes for it or \"they're out for the rest of the day\" at 6 for some dumbass reason. I've been here several times and it's the same story. The employees are more incompetent then Burger kings. Save your time and money and go to the one on eastern."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates. Missing the queso for the queso and chips.  Pork burrito has hardly any pork.  Guacamole is old and gross.  Im disappointed and upset that i just spent $40 on this crap."}
{"text":"The food would get 5 starts, but  I am sooo Frustrated that  they have to nickel and dime you and even charge extra for condiments! The quesadillas are $7.50 and only have 3 oz of cheese in them and $1.25 for extra salad dressing WTF???? They even charged me extra for shredded cheese on my veggie salad- I feel so taken advantage of it is hard for me to enjoy the food...I think the most annoying part is that they have to say \"Extra Cheese\" very loudly in a sing song voice so it sounds campy as the cashier quickly rings it up and reams you at the same time..."}
{"text":"Today, I visited Cafe Rio for a quick tortilla soup and left with the following:  1 Tortilla soup (yay!) 1 long, dark hair in the foil-wrapped tortilla that accompanied said tortilla soup (boo!) 20 minutes of my life gone waiting in the world's slowest line behind maybe 8 people 7 splatters of bleach on my custom-tailored VINCE sheath dress 0 stamps for my now-defunct stamp card, because I won't download their app  In case you're wondering, 75 is the number of tortilla soups I would need to eliminate from my diet to pay to replace the ruined dress. Which is definitely more than I've eaten in my life. So I'm pretty much never going back."}
{"text":"I don't understand the excitement about this place. Went for lunch and tried the chicken tostada. It was ok.  They do have fresh tortillas that are cooked in front of you so that was nice. I had the tostada sans tortilla so cannot comment on how it tastes but it looked good. The cafe itself is cute and busy but I may not go back!"}
{"text":"After reading several of the other reviews, it is obvious that is not just me that had a poor experience with the staff. The first girl that I spoke with was nice enough, but as I got further down the line, the staff just got ruder and ruder. No one was actually paying attention to the customers, they were all talking to each other in the back and goofing off. The young man checking me out at the end, Venecia, was very rude. I do not come here very often, but when I do the staff at this location always has terrible customer service and I would know, as I also work in the customer service industry. Just a note to the management, improve your team's customer service or you will just continue to lose clients, it is not that hard."}
{"text":"i love love love cafe rio! The best mexican place everrrrr. The shredded chicken salad is my all time favorite. The chicken quesadilla is also one of my favorites. They tend to get busy towards dinner but that's why their app becomes very useful! You can order online and walk in and pick it up. I also love their mints :)"}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite place to eat! However, I won't be coming back to this location. It's very unclean. At first, when walking up the steps, you see bags and bags of trash that have opened and are  pouring out by their side door. The employees have no expression & seem really unhappy to be there. No greeting, no affect on their face. The glass to see the meats, veggies, etc was splattered with sauce. Tables were dirty, floor had debris on it, and the women's bathroom had no toilet paper. It wasn't a very busy time of day (4pm) and so I was surprised that everywhere I looked, tables, counters, floors were dirty, including outside. I won't be returning to this location. If it is this unclean, I'm concerned about sanitary keepings for the food."}
{"text":"The only reason for the two stars is because I love cafe rio food. This location, however, is consistently chaotic and at least half of the front line employees seem high. Like all the time. Which is their prerogative, but when it comes to me paying nearly $30 for two salads, I want them made correctly and when I order extra cheese for $1, please don't sprinkle more cotija then look at me like I'm crazy for wanting the shredded cheese.   Manager- you need to be around your dinner crew and pay attention to their hazy looks on their faces, realizing that they are not giving proper customer service in that condition."}
{"text":"Gave Cafe Rio a try after a friend recommended it. Tried the steak burrito enchilada style and two tacos: chicken and pork barbacoa, and ordered chips and salsa.   The steak burrito was quite good. The tacos, however, weren't. The pork was way too sweet for my liking and the chicken was far too bland. The chips were ok, one of the salsa was heavily flavored with lime, to the point it was inedible. The other was decent.  Photos are posted."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse. I don't know what the answer is but the manager needs to quit and the cooperate office needs to come fire everyone. I don't understand why. Last week my salad container was wiped with a very dirty wash rag, one that was used to clean their line and maybe the deep fryer. It looked freaking horrific. I informed the manager and she had my food re-made. The person who made it never washed her hands, did not change gloves, and needs to be re-trained. Today I stopped in to see if things were different.  Sad to say they are not. Service took 30 minutes. I had to constantly ask for their attention. Nobody listened. It's abysmal. Then on my way out the girl bringing back the garbage can was wearing gloves, but touches the door handle, and goes straight to organizing the forks and spoons. Why has the state not investigated? I ate 4-5 meals a week here. I ate at Cafe Rio when I was a medic in Salt Lake City. This place is a hole and needs to be addressed l. If you want to possibly end up in the hospital from E-Coli come here."}
{"text":"When my husband and I first started coming to this Cafe Rio location all the employees were awesome! They were kind, outgoing, fun, and competent. After Steve left, the service has been on a steep decline. The service is awful and the employees look miserable and are not kind. The food is still good (although it is hit or miss in freshness, we have had old looking lettuce and guac sometimes) and we will probably continue going here because of the convenience and price. But it is evident that management has not created a great environment for their employees in how miserable everyone always looks and how little effort they put into their service."}
{"text":"Run, crawl, moonwalk....do whatever you need to do to frequent this glorious establishment. My mouth waters at the sheer thought of their pork barbacoa. It's so flavorful and perfectly prepared I rarely can convince myself to get anything else. When I'm a starving beast, I go for the burrito. When I feel like behaving myself, I grab some enchiladas, but honestly with their fresh ingredients and wide array of choices, I don't think a poor choice is possible. The man in my life loves the fire grilled steak tacos.   Perhaps your first time around the ordering process may seem a bit stressful, there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen for sure. But once you get your favorites nailed down you'll be a pro! Pick certain items and you may even get a song (the nachos are most entertaining). They do have pick up with a dedicated register so if you can't handle the stress just call it in! There's usually a pretty decent wait at this location so this is a wise choice around dinner.   Lots of drinks to choose from too, including my favorite the Mint Limeade. Refreshing and delish! The 5th star was a necessity as they also offer your choice of favorite hot sauce! Any place that provides more condiments than you know what to do with earns major bonus points in my book. Tapatio, cholula, YUM!   Try it out, this location or any....I think you'll be very pleased!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up dinner at 9:45 on a Tuesday. Boyfriend tried to order a grilled chicken burrito and was told they turned the grill off already because it was almost closing time. Really? An hour and 15 mins till closing?? Also, please note we were part of a line of at LEAST 15 other people. So it was not a slow night. Super lame."}
{"text":"Love the food, always have. But when you have 8 employees \"working\" and only a few customers in line it should not take 23 minutes. The poor kid on the front line was in training, understandable learning curve, but he had to keep going back to the back to restock the prep line multiple times himself just while I was in line. You could tell he was fustrated by his vulgar language talking under his breath but where all customers could hear. Other employees were just talking or on their cell phones.  If you stop and think about the health side of that...we use our cell phones during some \"wash your hands when done\" times. Not the time I want you touching my food right after.  Finally got most of our food and sat down to eat. After about 25 minutes, and we were done eating, we still had not received some of our food. End up going back to the register for a refund. Food was still good, as always, but the people working simply did not care about anything.  -Unacceptable wait time -Never received all our food, refunded for missing items -Food was good, though sanitation was poor"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Chipotle but figured Cafe Rio would be basically the same thing. What a mistake. I've never regretted eating a meal more. Not only was the food completely bland, the service was awful. The kid who took our order was radiating hatred at every customer and seemed to be annoyed that we were there despite how easy our order was and then the girl who rang us up never made eye contact once. It made for a pretty uncomfortable environment and then the food was just a giant let down. I'll definitely head straight for Chipotle next time, or better yet, Lindo Michochaun."}
{"text":"I recently visited the location on 4830 Blue Diamond Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89139 on Saturday June 24th.  This was my 2nd time dining at a Café Rio, the 1st time being a week ago at the location on Durango Rd.  I was highly impressed with the quality of the food and the service from my 1st experience, so I decided to stop by again at a location closer to my home.  Unfortunately, the 2nd time around was not a pleasurable experience.  I received lackluster service and encountered severely unprofessional staff members. I arrived around 10pm and the store wasn't busy at all.  A few patrons in the dining room, and no one in line, so I walked straight to the front.  There were 2 employees present with their backs turned to the line, one of which was playing on her cell phone in clear view on the food service line (she ended up being the cashier).  After waiting for a bit, I was finally acknowledge by a female staff member who said \"we'll be right with you in a second,\" and she calls to the frontline chef who was in a back area.  After the frontline chef comes up, he asks me \"what do you want?\" to which I asked \"Do the nachos come with a protein?\"  I was extremely appalled when he answered \"What?!\".  Not an excuse me, pardon me, or could you please repeat that?  But straight up \"What?!\"  So after repeating my question, I continued on with my order.   About halfway through ordering my 2nd item, another staff member comes up and asks the frontline chef about garbage bags, so the chef stops talking to me and starts talking to his coworker instead.  After finally completing my order, the frontline chef turns his back and starts angrily talking to himself, complaining about the one who asked him about the garbage bags.  I clearly hear him say \"n*gga\" multiple times, and the female staff member discretely tells him \"stop saying the n-word!  They might hear you!\" to which the chef didn't seem to care nor stop his rant. At that point, my food was almost ready, and the female staff member could tell I was a little perturbed, so she was then extra nice and attentive to me, and decided to start using \"sir\" while adding the finishing touches to my order.  I then paid and promptly left the store. I wasn't expecting a fine dining level of service, but at the very least acknowledge me, don't treat me like I'm stupid, be polite/respectful and lastly be professional.  I didn't experience any of the above at that location.  I work in customer service myself and have worked food service as well, so I get it.  Now, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble or reprimanded, but I really wanted to bring this to your attention.  I'm a simple person, and very easy going, but the way I was treated and the way the staff acted was despicable."}
{"text":"By far the best  Mexican food in my area.   I get the chicken salad with cilantro dressing most of the time.   Yum yum yum!!!  Enchilada style burrito is also super delicious.  The place is super clean, the employees are friendly and quick to get your order to you."}
{"text":"Love the food, HATE their service. But it only seems like its at the  sahara and ft. apache location!  The other locations are so nice and friendly, this one questions you when you call to say your order is wrong. I called the other day to say my salad was wrong and the 5 mangers there couldn't answer the phone so I got some smart ass girl to ask me if I was sure I was wrong! I hate that its the only one near work so I have to go to it."}
{"text":"I was really excited when this place opened because I love the location In chandler. But when I went to visit this location last week it was so chaotic. I asked for a barbaqoa taco with no sides and they gave me a beef taco with beans on the inside. I don't know how they could mess that up as I had to repeat my order 3 times. I also asked for queso and chips, they gave me a queso that had been sitting out instead of pouring a new one, when I asked they pour me fresh queso, it was all burned and grainy as if it was sitting in heat for 5 hours. When I said I didn't want it anymore because it was burned, they said, \"well , that's how it is\". Um, no it doesn't. I will not be returning to this location. It makes me hesitant to go to any of their locations actually. Poor service and attitude plus food under heat lamps"}
{"text":"This place is trash always dirty. They slop your food on your dish. The staff just don't care about working here. Who ever does the hiring process here should be let go of this duty.  How hard is it to layer a taco, and scoop rice and beans. The staff here could not even work at Taco Bell or Dell Taco. Only gets one star cause I do like the pork here. I live over in this area every time I go to this place its allways trash that's why I have not been back in a year. So I thought I try it again. I was disappointed that this place has not changed. Were you order your food is always dirty and a big mess with food slop everywhere. This place does not practice clean as you go.   I'm finally done ever going to this place. Hope this review will help people to choose to go some were else besides having an awful experience that I have when I have been here."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Cafe Rio this afternoon.  Its fast casual mexican food w/ a cafeteria-like set up, kinda like a mexican subway.  My fav is the shredded chicken burrito w/ rice & black beans, enchilada style (verde sauce & melted cheese over the burrito).  I like the meat quality, seasoning & drink selection better at Cafe Rio over Chipotle.  The spice level at Chipotle is a little much for my 3yr old plus the free nino quesadilla is an added bonus.  Our total including drinks today was ~$25."}
{"text":"If not for the wait I would have given this place five stars but it is definitely worth the wait! I get the double steak tacos meal with their lime rice. I love the rice! I get the mild sauce that is pretty much just tomatoes,onions, and cilantro. The handmade tortillas are delicious and while you're waiting in line you can see the lady making them! My other favorite that is a must get is their guacamole with salsa and cheese on top!"}
{"text":"Love their food but hate ordering here. The customer  service also sucks. I usually order burrito enchilada style. Instead of green or red they ask \"hot\"? Hot can be green or red depending where your from.  They always leave red sauce off and have to go back and ask for red.  One time the manager,  Christina?,  remedied my inconvenience offering a meal to compensate for having to go back the next time we order and supposedly put it in the compliant log.  The next time came and the girl answering  the phone would not honor the meal or even go back to the log.  She insisted on having to wait as \"Christina is not here today\"."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received at any Cafe Rio location. The employees were talking and laughing amongst each other the whole time and looking at the customers as though they were inconceniening them...horrible service, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is great. The staff, not so much. They don't really give you time to see what you want. Herd you through like cattle. Horrible customer service.  Blonde girl at counter constantly gave me the evil eye as I was eating, I guess because I asked her to slow down when my 8 y.o. daughter was ordering. Will not return to this location as this was the second consecutive trip with horrible service. I'll take my $50 somewhere else."}
{"text":"so i'm not normally one to complain when a piece of hair falls into food i'll just pick it out but this time was horrible i pulled out a huge string of hair wrapped all up in my salad i had to pull it out of my mouth completely discussing i about threw up and when i showed it to the manager all she did was pick it up and refund me. i will never return to this place almost half of their employees have long hair but dont have a hair net. you would think a quality food chain place like this good afford hair nets and thanks to their lack of caring i will not be a customer that ever returns. this visit at this place completely ruined cafe rio for me which really sucks because i really liked this place :("}
{"text":"i like the Tuesday special of coconut shrimp tacos with a mango sauce.  Good portions.  Sauces are delicious.  meat is nice and moist.  tortillas are tasty and fresh.   just be careful because they will try to add on stuff, like if you want guacamole or extra sauce. they don't tell you some of the stuff is an extra .95 cents until they ring you up at the cash register."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to! I always order Sweet Pork Barbacoa Quesadilla... it's absolutely wonderful! The pico de gallo and guacamole is always fresh and the little dollop of sour cream they add with it completes the whole meal. The atmosphere is so fun and vibrant. It's a little pricey than other places but well worth it."}
{"text":"In all honesty, the more  I go here, the more I do actually find the prices a bit steep. I mean my chicken burrito is 6.95 not too bad, but my bill was 8.05 because of the sour cream I got. I never knew that you had to pay extra for the sour cream. Thanks for telling me... I will still give it a four because the food is fantastic, but I just wanted to make it clear to others that if you want sour scream or something enchilada style, then it is extra. Those things tend it add up at .95 cents and .50 cents an item. Just beware."}
{"text":"Tortillas made right in front of your face, a variety of different meat and sauce options. The fire-grilled chicken is my favorite. They dice the grilled chicken right there. Employees are efficient and friendly. This is my go to place-- especially when it's late because it's open until 10 on weekdays"}
{"text":"I have been eating at cafe rio (various locations) for years. Today's experience might have ruined it for me. Around noon I sat down to eat with my toddler. First off, the tortilla in my salad was freezing cold. They were under-staffed and the line was so long, I chose to power through instead of complaining about the tortilla temp. Out of the blue, my toddler became ill and vomited. I did my absolute best to clean up the area around us. I left our  $16 food on the table. I went up to the counter and told the cashier that I needed maintenance to disinfect our table. I wanted to be responsible and make sure they knew about the vomit before I left. She held her finger up at me and said \"it is the lunch rush, no one has time to help you right now, we're busy\".... I left the store at that time.  Around four o'clock, I called and asked for a manager. I believe I spoke with Anita? I did not catch her name. I very kindly explained the experience with the employee, and said I was very concerned about that area being properly cleaned. 1) she was not paying attention to me as I could hear her giggling throughout the phone call, and 2) she told me \"I was not here at that time so I'm not sure what happened\"- she then contradicted herself and said \"it definitely got cleaned up properly, thank you for calling\" I am crossing my fingers that the area we sat in truly did get properly disinfected...... I tried both in-store AND through a phone call to ensure it was cleaned. I wish I would have been offered a to-go lid. $16 wasted today.  Ps, don't sit in the corner booth by the drinks station."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is fast and the food is great!  A welcomed departure from the feeble Las Vegas attempts at Mexican Food.  As close to just good ol' Tex-Mex type burritos and enchiladas as you will find here.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Growing up in LA, I should know a lot about Mexican food, but the most I learned was what's good food and what's not good and Cafe Rio on Stephanie is always a homerun for good Mexican food. I always get their burrito bowl with sweet pork barbacoa. The enchilada-style is an extra buck, but I usually pass since it's just extra cheese and the burrito already has enough cheese (plus you can always ask them to go a bit heavier on the cheese if you're feeling cheesy). The line always moves quickly, but if you're really in a rush, you can always call in your order ahead of time before you go pick it up. It is family friendly but it can get fairly loud. Be sure to get their stamp card, you can get a free burrito (with drink!) if you get 10 stamps (1 stamp per entree). Their staff is very friendly and I always enjoy my meal coming out of Cafe Rio. I am a loyal customer at this location because of their food quality and excellent service."}
{"text":"Hate to do this to a company I use to really enjoy but this one star rating has been my normal experience at this location. Wife had a pretty bad day and wanted to get a salad with steak from here. Was a bit surprised to see the place nearly empty (1 person in line and 2 couples eating), but now know why. I stood in line for a bit before finally beginning to time how long it would take for one of the 7 employees to even say hello, let alone take my order.   I did not see one employee with a smile and most seemed like they just did not want to be there. It took nearly 15 minutes to take my order with seven employees! The person in front of me was already paying by the time I reached the front of the line. After ordering, I went to get our drinks, only to find that the Horchata and the mint-lemonade were heavily watered down. Think of water with a slice of lemon. Had we dined in, i would have caught the flavorless drinks and got a refund.   Will not return and will be sure to let others know not to waste their time or money here."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has been a favorite spot of mine for a long while now. I have been to their locations in Utah, Washington, and Nevada. It's a step above Chipotle and they have daily specials that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu. The only downfall with this place is that if you're not careful when you're ordering you can end up dropping around 15 dollars for lunch. The portions are all pretty damn big. My favorite thing to order is the Sweet Pork Tostada! This location is right across from UNLV so it can get VERY BUSY!!"}
{"text":"Very good burritos and salads. Their cilantro lime dressing is addicting. It is overpriced for a quick casual restaurant. For that reason we only go here occasionally but when we do we always love it."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow and confused.  Asked for guacamole twice and was told it was inside the burrito (it was not).  When I asked for pico de gallo, the gal ended up giving me a bunch of diced tomatoes.  The steak was not seasoned and the burrito overall had little flavor, if any.  I decided to try this place because I wanted to do something a little nice than Roberto's or Taco Bell.  Should have picked another place."}
{"text":"The chicken salad is the best thing on the menu. I typically ask for the shredded chicken with the shredded lettuce and house dressing. Definitely not authentic but still a darn good salad."}
{"text":"Well, it used to be our favorite for the sweet pork barbacoa burrito. It's still huge, and the meat flavor is still amazing. But the service isn't the same, the drink machines aren't mixed well, and there's alot less meat in the burrito. As much as i like beans & rice, it's called a pork burrito, not an 'oh by the way here's some pork' burrito."}
{"text":"Best place everrrrrr!!! Great tacos and very very fresh!! Since I found this place I go at least 2 times a week. Great lunch service!! Keep up the great work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The only thing that sucks is the service. The lady taking my order made my salad all messy and didny.even ask.if I wanted shredded lettuce or regular. I.barley got any meat. Also the cashier wasnt even talking to me. She was talking on the headphone with another employee about someones babys mama. A discussion that shouldnt be spoken at work and especially in front of a customer. There was no thank u at all and no eye contact. Also, the pink lemonade was all watered down."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Rude on the phone.  App never works.  They are always out of something.  There have been so many times I have seen the super long line & walked right back out. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Can't beat the Sweet Pork Barbacoa as a meat choice on/in EVERYTHING. The Taco Salad and Tortilla Soup also should not be missed. If you're pressed for time I recommend ordering online ahead of time as the wait can get a little ridiculous. Good tasting food in a great location. Worth a stop in."}
{"text":"FYI...don't order takeout online from Cafe Rio at Signal Butte in Mesa. Just stand in line, like the 200 people (slight exaggeration, but it was a lot...lol) I've seen getting their food before me. I could have gone through the line 3 times already! NOW THE GIRL TELLS ME THEY ONLY DO FISH ON FRIDAY.. IT'S FREAKING FRIDAY!@!  Needless to say,  I won't be ordering takeout from here in the future.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Rio for a salad this evening.  They were out of lettuce even though there were four or five employees standing around doing nothing but chatting.  Finally, some rude young man decided to chop up some romaine.  I could see him from where I was standing.  He took a head of romaine from the box on the floor and started chopping it up WITHOUT WASHING IT!  When he came up front and dumped the lettuce he had chopped up in the tray, I confronted him and said he hadn't washed the lettuce.  He said \" we wash the lettuce and then store it in the box\", which I knew was total BS.  Then he claimed he washed it and got cocky when I said no you didn't, I could see you\".  The cashier asked if I wanted a refund and I said I did.  The manager came up and asked me what happened and I told her.  She agreed that the lettuce had to be washed before being chopped up and served to the customers.  She apologized, but I will not be going back to this place.  Too many lazy employees have ruined this place."}
{"text":"Place is always busy.  Great tropical tea and good food, especially for a fast food type place."}
{"text":"I normally love Cafe Rio.  The he food is always consistently good, both in the state of Utah and Arizona,  but today I went out of my way to treat myself and my order got all mixed up because she couldn't understand me I couldn't hear her and instead of getting the special I got charged the full regular dish and when I told the cashier she didn't offer to fix anything so I just found out that there's another location that will get my business and I will not go back to the Gilbert one if I don't have to.  Very disappointed in the service even though I know the food's  good."}
{"text":"Great food but terribly slow service. Would be 4 stars but stand in line for 20 minutes most days. Need to speed up the line.   In terms of food the salad and wet burrito are great. Go for the shredded chicken or pork.   Hope they can figure out the slow service issues"}
{"text":"Its really a shame the management is not better at this location. There is food spilled all over, the staffs family is in with their toddlers frequently, 2 year olds touching and pulling down the cups set up by the register. I could walk in this location and while waiting in line I can pick out a dozen health code violations and I don't work for the health department, but, it's common sense stuff. There are always flys buzzing around and not to mention the tables are filthy and sticky and clearly dirty. Sitting at a table for me, is not an option. Last time I did they were filthy! The floors are sticky and dirty, as I left you can see all the filth and hand prints on the glass doors. I have actually even reported this location to the health department over a year ago after I spoke with the manager and he flat out told me if I didn't like their practices to go to a different location. WHAT?  It does not appear my report to the health department did any good. This sucks because this is the side of town I live on and I crave cafe rios food the way it is supposedly to be. So if you want good cafe rio, you have to go to the S.Eastern location or Stephanie st. in Henderson. Skip this place if you want to feel ok after you eat. I have had to recook my food when I get home, after buying at this location to ensure I don't get sick. I wish something would change. But it's been almost 2 years of the exact same! Good luck if you go there!"}
{"text":"I like Cafe Rio but this location is different.  It is the service that sets it apart and not in a good way.  I've been to this location 3 times and each time there was at least one undesirable encounter with the workers.  It is almost as if they are making money with or without customers.  Not very good attitude and almost condescending!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe rio is definitely one of my comfort food! It's worth it for the price you pay. Salmon burrito enchilada style is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the manager and staff with my experience at this location 4/29. The staff informed me they are out of salmon for fish tacos and if I wanted to wait it would be about 7 minutes. I said i'll take vegetarian. but they insisted it would be a treat to wait for the salmon so I did.. It ended up taking around 30 minutes. But patient as I am I waited quietly. The manager came over and apologized and offered me a free soft drink, and 50% off my meal for my time waited. When the salmon was ready, they made me some great fantastic tasting tacos, and went above and beyond with my meal and service. Very satisfied customer and I shall return again many times in the future. Thank you"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. They have really good barbacoa and horchata. It's a good place to take your family to for dinner. It can be hard to park or pull out seeing how it is on the corner and right by an exit of the shopping center."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this Cafe Rio for many years,  however I was very disappointed tonight when we ordered dinner for our family on their mobile app.  We placed our order 30 minutes ahead and we arrived at 6:15, the time their app said the order would be ready.  They were not busy at all when we arrived but or order was not ready.  We walked out with our order at 6:30 with a free dessert, which was nice, but we would have preferred to have had our dinner on time instead."}
{"text":"Never ever returning to this location. I go to this Cafe Rio all the time. They give me 50% off every time for the longest time. New Asian Manager told me that they give nobody 50% off and he's going to talk to the employee that's been giving me the discount. The service here is bad but the food is good. BRING BACK THE OLD MANAGER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant food, its quick and very fresh. The employees are friendly.  One of my fav places for lunch. Salads are delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant usually delivers I just ordered three items for pickup and none of my salads had any dressing with them. I called them back after getting home to ask if this was something they just forgot and I was left on an open line without even being asked to hold or given advice what was happening next....  Eventually after waiting for 5 minutes and countless hollers \"anyone there\" I hung up and wrote this review. Not very good customer service after ordering and delivering the product."}
{"text":"On hold on the phone for five minutes to place an order, I might as well wait in line."}
{"text":"Michael gave us exceptional service. We truly enjoyed our experience! Thank you so much !"}
{"text":"I purchased a really large order spent over $100 dollars And the only thing I asked for my meal was enchilada style burrito and extra salsa with the lettuce not only did I get a very small amount of lettuce and salsa but no enchilada style I called to tell them about the rep said that next time they will pay attention yea thank you very much"}
{"text":"What a disappointing visit. Employees were distracted and they were very slow. No ice in machine. Put toppings we didn't request on meal. Not used to this at this location. However, a rally bad visit."}
{"text":"Good steak. Love their tortillas. Very good americanized mexican food. I love that they give free quesadillas to children, huge plus. My  wife always gets their salad for the creamy cilantro dressing, which is amazing. I usually get a steak burrito or the roast beef chile burrito."}
{"text":"I have used their catering twice now for parties at my home. I go with the tacos everytime because you can't go wrong. They show up timely, set everything up, and are very courteous and professional! The food is delicious and my guests always rave about it!! I will use them again and again!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the food was good, even though the service was horrible.  The place was busy for dinner and there was a large line waiting.  The ingredient area was a mess with other foods mixed in with other items.  The employees would make the food and have to take out the other ingredients that weren't supposed to be be in the dish.  When it was our turn to order (for a family of four) the employee took two of our orders then started a take out order.  Once she finished that one she asked us for the rest of our order, one of which was an enchilada styled burrito. After she made it handed told another employee to finish it and walked away because she had to \"change her gloves.\"  That employee grabbed the burrito dish and turned around to put it into the cooker, but the foil collapsed on her and the burrito fell onto the flat top.  She gathered all of the ingredients and put it back together and put it into the oven.  But now all of the sauce was now gone, so it came out dry.  We moved down the line and the employee who finished the order would ask us what we wanted on the dishes, but then would turn around and work on the to-go order, so we basically had to keep repeating everything to him because he wasn't listening.  After a few times it really became frustrating.    When it was time to pay, the cashier only had two of our meals and we had to point out that the other half of our dishes were still waiting to be finished, since there were several to-go orders in between all of ours now.   I had my phone out with the Cafe Rio app open to get credit for our order, but the cashier never looked up after getting our credit card and closed out the order and handed the card back without even looking at us.  She started to ring up the to-go order and we had to remind her that we needed our drink cups. She had that \"oops\" look and handed us the cups, but never said a word and kept ringing up the to-go order.  This will be the last time we will be going to this particular location.  It is extremely rude to ignore the person in front of you while working on somebody's order who is not even there.  And why bother asking questions if you don't listen to us anyways.  The other reviews about bad service were accurate!  Needless to say when it slowed down nobody came around and asked us how our visit was going, I don't think they really care."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio. this is my place, man. last time I was there, I ordered a barbacoa quesadilla. they woman in front of me ordered a spicy pork quesadilla. as you all may know, barbacoa is sweet pork. the woman at the first station took our order and had no problem except she had a bad attitude. she gave her co-worker attitude when she gave her the receipt for a call-in order and told her not to forget the extra cheese. , the issue was when I get to the second station the woman asked the girl in front of me what she had and the woman said \"I had the pork quesadilla.\" k well I had a pork quesadilla too but we had different kinds so can u handle this?? I didn't say that but you get it. please clarify which order your customer has so they don't ruin other peoples order. it's very frustrating to get home and see that you got the wrong food. I'm definitely coming back its just that I don't want this to happen again. I know one of the girls that works here though and her name is Erica and she's so sweet. I love her! the worst part about this though is that I was cravingggg a barbacoa burrito w hot sauce on it (which I recommend you get bc its fuego) and they gave me the quesadilla with the wrong meat :(( still coming back though. I hate looking at the reviews and seeing bad ones because I love cafe rio to death."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with my Order from here today. I've been eating Cafe Rio 2-3x a week for a long time & it's usually spot on regardless of if order and eat there or for pickup. Pleased an order online for pickup today, my sister can't have cheese so ordered hers with no cheese. We pretty much get the same thing (salad) but she gets black beans & I get Pinto beans. They put cheese on the wrong one which meant I was stuck with black beans & they made the salad extra soupy, there was not much lettuce or anything other than just really soupy black beans & a whole shit load of them.  Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Have you ever gotten full from a salad? If you order the Sweet Pork Barbacoa Salad you will be.  I'm impressed, I typically wouldn't eat salad if I'm ordering food but the portion is huge and for under $9.00 you can't go wrong!  This will be my go to spot when I want some quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"The place was dirty, about 90% of the tables had stuff on them. The music was too loud so one had to shout when ordering. Some of the drink machines were broken without signs (just hanging metal pieces)."}
{"text":"Going on day 3 of my poisoning from this dump. I haven't eaten anything since my cold watery fire grilled steak tacos Tuesday.  No answer or ability to get calls returned from corporate.  Worst restaurant experience ever. Never eating Cafe Rio again."}
{"text":"The worst food I have ever had.  I tried again, for the last time, and I am sending my plumbing bill to their corporate headquarters."}
{"text":"I recently visited Las Vegas for a couple weeks and had cafe rios for the first time. I'm not a big fan of chipotle. I usually prefer Moes but cafe rios was a lot better. More flavor and better options. I ate here twice during my stay. Both times I got their huge salads. Once with grilled chicken, the other time with grilled steak. Both were flavor full and juicy. The creamy house dressing was one of the best dressings ive ever had. Everything is made right in front of you even the tortillas. The flour tortilla was freshly made and soft, a little too thick. My salad included all basic toppings including a small scoop of guac. For around 9-10$ I got a huge salad. At this price point, I feel the quality and quantity was spot on. Great spot to grab a quick lunch. I will be coming back on my next trip out west."}
{"text":"I live really close to this location and was looking forward to it opening. I have gone to it a hand full of times now and they have been out of grilled chicken and grilled steak every time I have tried lunch and dinner times. Completely unacceptable especially for a new location that should be on top of their game."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio, where do I start? This place is one of the better Mexican places that one can go to. It's set up like most \"fast food\" Mexican places. You tell the person what you want, pick your meat and toppings and then pay at the end. The service is usually good and they aren't stingy with the toppings.  Now for the food. Mark my words. Cafe Rio has some of the BEST Barbacoa on this earth. Whether it's in a burrito or topping a salad or nachos you can't go wrong. I've tried the fire-grilled chicken and steak and it just can't compete with the Pork. If you order a burrito you can get it enchilada style (covered in sauce) or regular. The burrito is huge and almost enough for 2 meals. The salads are definitely enough for 2 meals. Just yesterday I ate the greens out of the salad for one meal, then rolled it up into a burrito for a 2nd meal. The nachos are amazing. Loaded and nice crispy house-made chips.  These are great, but they can't even compare to the greatness that is Cafe Rio's Queso Dip. Once you have it, it is life-changing. I like to call it spackle for your insides. Once you eat it, it fills every nook and cranny in your stomach leaving you full and satisfied. It's hard to put how good it is in words.  So go to Cafe Rio. I guarantee you'll find something there that you'll love."}
{"text":"What I had: Pork Barbacoa Tostada (Taco Salad), Papaya/Mango Agua Fresca  Price Total: $11.08   The Good: Fresh Ingredients, Lots of topping choices  The Bad: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Essentially this place is doing the exact same thing Chipotle and Zaba's does only Chipotle and Zaba's do it better for cheaper. A single Taco here costs $5 to start with. My tostada (which was more like a Taco Salad) was $9 BEFORE I even ordered a drink! They don't fry the shell like most other places would. You could get 2 HUGE Taco Salads from Roberto's Taco Shop for the price of 1 REGULAR one here. This place prides itself on the idea that they make their own tortillas and the fact they have pork barbacoa. (1) Their tortillas are bland and there is NOTHING special about them. (2) Their pork barbacoa is tangy and tasty but it tastes like that cheap BBQ you would get at a buffet. \"Tacos El Gordo\" makes MUCH BETTER Barbacoa for only $2/taco. The Agua Fresca I had here was $2.50 but \"La Flor de Michoacan Artisinal\" makes MUCH BETTER Agua Fresca and gives you a HUGE cup for the same price or less. When I got to the register, the manager asked me if I want the \"house dressing\" which looked like guacamole. I said no and then he said something weird like \"Well, since he didn't get the house dressing, don't charge him for the sour cream\" (implying that normally I would have to pay EXTRA for the sour cream), which was NOT explained to me as I ordered it.  The Ugly: There seems to be a racial divide in this place. It seems to be run by Mormons. There are NO BLACK PEOPLE on the staff and there's 20-30 people working there (Note: Mormons don't like Black people). There are some Mexicans working there but they get the crappy kitchen jobs while the Mormons get the cushy easy jobs.  They offer \"curb side service\" instead of having a drive-thru. This actually screws traffic and the parking lot up."}
{"text":"Can't give zero stars or negative stars or I would! It's such a shame to have such good food, but the time to wait to get it is ridiculous! Almost an hour!   Plus you ran out of multiple meats. Get your Sh@t together"}
{"text":"This is definitely the last time I'm ever eating at Cafe Rio! This was my favorite place but never ever coming back. There was a bug in my salad! If you ever come to cafe rio, go In The morning when everything's fresh. I went in the evening and it was a mess, no grilled chicken, no pinto beans. Restaurant was dirty and a nasty a-- bug in my salad. The shift leader Bruce did not even apologize for the inconvenience. Instead he said \"oh, I don't know how that got there\" SMH! Never ever again. Beware guys, unless you're feeling gutsy and want to eat bugs with your food. If I could rate no stars, I would. SMH"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is really good and convenient when you're in a rush- even during lunch hour. The line takes about 5-10 mins, the staff is upbeat and polite. I usually get the same thing, chicken enchiladas. The tortillas are made fresh and their chicken enchiladas are extremely good. Flavors are a little bland, portions are good. You have to remind them not to drown your enchiladas in their sauce. I'll be a regular for during the week lunch breaks. Overall good food and good service."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Order pick up and they waited to clear their lines before making mine. I watched two full lines get serviced before I got my two salads. Not coming back. Chipotles up the street."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here prob once a week for the chicken salad w the house dressing and extra tortilla chip strips. The ingredients are always fresh and the tortillas are amazing! My mouth waters as I'm waiting in line watching the woman placing the tortillas on the hot rotating griddle to cook them ugh soooo good! I also love their black beans ... If u usually go for pinto give these a try instead u won't be sorry. My family has tried just about everything here from the pork to the grilled steak to the tamales (I think thurs is tamales special they r homemade and delicious) everything is great. Bonus they have diet dr pepper my favorite :) The price is very reasonable for the quality and portion I find it a bargain!"}
{"text":"So we are from NY and the kids wanted chipotle (I know, weird). Well the near by chipotle was closed (some meeting was going on?) so we decided to come here, go to yogurtland next door afterwards. All of us agreed that we were happy chipotle was closed that day because cafe Rio blew us off our seats. Everything was fresh, quick, easy, clean. I took away one stars because although everything was delicious, the meats all tasted too similar."}
{"text":"Food is always good but really learn how to roll a burrito if you spend a little more time i wouldn't have had to been re rolled and also no one was in line the employee was like going as fast as she can seems like she didn't even care"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been Cafe Rio fans for years, however this location is the worst we have ever been to! We have been to this location at least 3 times and each time is worse than the last so we won't be back. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, we weren't asked which type of chicken we wanted and the girl put wet chicken in the quesadilla, you can imagine how soggy that would be, yuck! I told her is it's that chicken then we want steak, got an attitude. We have been overcharged at this location as well. We were finally at the register and asked for a side of salsa for the quesadilla, it took a while and we were given enchilada sauce, wth!? We went to get our drinks, the mint lemonade is empty, so I walk to the register to tell them and I was told they are out of the lemonade. We love the mint lemonade and it is one of the main reasons we go there. So disappointing...."}
{"text":"This is the best cafe rio in all of Phoenix. Service is amazing. Customer focused and driven to give the people what they ask for. Great job guys. Keep it going. You're amazing"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has made it on my monthly routine, if not a couple times a month. :) I used to order over the phone... it never worked, so I finally downloaded the app. It's always a 30-45 minute wait once you placed your order. Since I work about 40 minutes I just pace the order before I head home... so no harm,  no foul for me.  The food is delish!  I have purchased almost all of the different entrees and they are all yummy!"}
{"text":"Usually I have a pretty good experience here.. good customer service and food. Today I ordered two grilled chicken tacos online. I get there to pick up my food and it wasn't done... then the person who made it, made me these sad tacos. Barely any meat or lettuce... sad.. and we all know grilled chicken costs extra. Not happy today"}
{"text":"I love this location, it's always busy but the line always goes by so quick! Everybody is so friendly and sweet!"}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in but felt like I had to. I ordered the sweet pork soft tacos and my sister got the enchiladas. We shared a soda and it was $20. The sweet pork tasted like someone poured a bag of sugar into a crock pot w a chunk of pork. I had to return it, it was that bad and I never return anything. Sisters food was as bad but she regretfully choked it down.   This place is the subway of Mexican food. All lettuce and tomato. They were so skimpy on the cheese and meat, it was embarrassing. The first two bites was all bread and lettuce... they were the two best bites.   The cashier refunded my money but was short and brash through the whole transaction. It made me think that they get this complaint a lot. I won't be going back. I will however go to blaze pizza which is conveniently in the same shopping center. I told the cashier at blaze pizza about my experience and he laughed. He then explained to me that they get a lot of business thanks to unsatisfied customers coming over from cafe rio."}
{"text":"I called in an order at 12:50 and they tell me the order will be ready by 1:10pm.. I show up at 1:35 and ask they guy goes to look and doesn't find anything.. doesn't tell me anything aside from Go and pay there I pay and I guess he is still looking for my order.. prints something out gives it to the line.. the lady at the  register take my money doesn't respond when I ask if my order is not ready hands me my change I ask again and she semi ignores me and says she doesn't know.. I ask to speak to a manager and a Leslie comes I tell her situation and she has nothing to say but hand me a cup while I wait.. absolutely I unacceptable doesn't even bother to fess up on the error or apologize.. very disappointed.. so I decided to rate being I am still standing here waiting on my food in ten min it will be an hour from the time I called in the order..   And they forgot to remove the pico.. forgot my extra sour cream.. disappointing"}
{"text":"Worst customer service!  Rude and unprofessional  Made an order online , they didn't get it right and when we called they were rude and did not take any responsibility  (although we have a receipt showing the correct order)  We went back to return the food, that same employee was rude and didn't talk to us... instead of fixing it the manager had no clue on what customer service is  Cafe rio, train your employees on customer service !!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe in the 21st century me and my family encountered racism at Cafe Rio, we're a Hispanic family more specially Mexican. There was a Caucasian lady in the line and first of all, she ignored us and when she finally helped us, my mom asked for a toasty tortilla, she ignored her completely and left the tortilla sitting. She then moved on to the next person and we couldn't believe it was happening right now to us. I knew it was racism because she only treated the Caucasian people nicely and we were treated like complete crap. In the end, we got nasty food and the lady had to be told by a really nice Caucasian man behind us that she completely ignored us. She ended up helping us without our toasty tortilla after we told her again how we wanted it, she also put way too little chicken and we told her but she ignored us. I had a complete disgusting experience, I hated being there and it wasn't just the lady, there were other workers in the line who were complete A Holes, I hate Cafe Rio now because of that disgusting experience and now I'll stick to Chipotle because at Chipotle I felt like I was important."}
{"text":"This place is good. Tortillas are amazing. The service can be great or terrible but is always SLOW as molasses. They seriously need to reconsider how they take orders here. It's so unorganized and you have no idea what goes on your entree or what's \"extra\". I'm not a fan of the iPad ordering but maybe this place would benefit from it. Or maybe just some training from Chipotle's setup?We avoid Cafe Rio unless it's a down time because the wait is such a pain, which sucks because it's delicious."}
{"text":"I  had the Tuesday special - coconut shrimp tacos with rice and beans . They were good but not like wow !  The pineapple sauce was way to sweet it kinda tooK away the flavor of the taco . There was more lettuce in those tacos than shrimp .  Over all the tortillas still my favorite thing  here, they are fresh made and the best tortillas i had tasted in vegas . The aguas frescas are really good too"}
{"text":"Staff  can be rude at times . They 9nly give discounts to people they feel like it .  Cream for salad should be free  but you get charged  $1 dollar . It's OK place"}
{"text":"I been to all the locations  and this place is always clean and staff is friendly. I love  all the items on menu . The only thing that I don't like is that when ever we order salad you get charged for the dressing  when it should be for free , besides that  this restaurant is a must . Don't forget to get fresh baked flour tortillas."}
{"text":"Good coconut shrimp tacos but they need to speed up the service and they need to have the special more days a week"}
{"text":"Came in 11/5 and had horrible service. They saw and heard I wasn't happy with my soup as i dosnt want the guacamole or pico in it and instead of offering me a new bowl just charged me and didn't care.  I had to reach around the counter and get a cup to get he pico out as i HATE tomatoes.   They did not care one tiny bit. I usually enjoy this place for quick tasty Mexican. 100% disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this cafe rio. Specifically because they aren't shy on that meat. If you go to the one on Eastern, it's really skimpy on the pork-goodness. But not here! They are very liberal in application and my mouth has never been more satisfied!"}
{"text":"Been a cafe rio fan for over 10 years growing up in Utah , can say that this cafe rio is the worst , still standing online with only 6 people ahead of me , going on 20 minutes now , ridiculous , also just heard them say 15 minute wait for steak ! Sad to say this cafe rio will never get my business again ."}
{"text":"The standard chain burrito joint, that lacks flavor and is way overpriced. The burritos are very wet, meaning by the time you eat half of it, the other half will fall apart so ask for a fork."}
{"text":"I've been to this cafe rio several times and although the food isn't great, it's a closer drive than the cafe rio on Stephanie. Most times, their rice is hard, beans are undercooked or just look like they have been sitting out for days. Even the area where they make the food looks super unsanitary. Today I waited 30 minutes in line only to get to order and find out they're out of pork and chicken. If you're going to be out of something, you should at least tell the people waiting in line! I wouldn't suggest this location. I'd rather take the drive for better food and service."}
{"text":"Went here last week, Employees were rude and basically really didn't care. They were out of supplies so instead of telling me I just didn't get what I paid for.  I asked for two salads one Vegetarian which should have then got extra beans and rice which I didn't get, Then was charged $1.00 for extra sauce.  Ordered nino quesadillas and they were left on grill too long and was given to me burnt.    Girl at register was very rude, will not return to this location.  Very sad!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the grilled chicken enchiladas. Blech.   All I could taste after only finishing half the order was SALT! You know, the kind of taste in your mouth that won't go away.  The enchiladas were so heavily sauced, I guess I should have asked them to hold back on the sauce, but this being my first time to Cafe Rio on Lake Mead I decided to eat the dish the way they prepared it for others. The chicken was super dry even with all the added medium sauce they smothered it in. The combination of beans, rice, and sauce all created this big runny blob of salt-laden goo.  I have to give the staff compliments for being so efficient and friendly. They deserve 4 stars for that."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. They nickel-and-dime you for everything, but you don't know you're incurring by extra fees until you get to the cash register.   While I'm not a big fan of their biggest competitor, due to taste, at least that place will tell you if there's an extra charge for something like guacamole.   Here they go along the line and they simply asked if you want anything in your burrito, then you find out at the register that there was a surcharge for the chicken I picked, sour cream was extra, even an extra side of sauce was an extra fee!   They bank on the fact that you don't realize that's all extra, and then you pay once the meal is already prepared.  Don't get me wrong, many places charge extra fees for things, but the fact none of this is disclosed when you're actually getting the item, that's where  it becomes deceptive. The food was ok, nothing special, and they are very skimpy on the beans and rice, which again, their biggest competitor doesn't nickel-and-dime you to get a full portion. Buyer beware.  PS, seating is terrible, very few tables for the size. Once you get your food, good luck finding a place to sit"}
{"text":"I usually have good experiences here, but tonight was horrible. The staff was rude, they messed up my order and then had attitude when I said something. They were sloppy when making the food, my taco was spilled on the grill and the girl just laughed and scooped it up back into the tinfoil. I was going to let this go because everyone has bad days and I get that. But then to top it off I get home and as I'm picking out the tomatoes that I asked them not to put on my taco, there is a ladybig...or half a lady bug rather. So in the garbage that meal went.  But the ice was great!"}
{"text":"CAFE Pay for SOUR CREAM!  I'm sorry but this is the worst place I've ate at in Phoenix this year.  Steak burrito was tasteless and bland. Then to add insult to injury, you look at your receipt and find you get charged for all your salsa and sauce, even sour cream??...really   P.S. you can eat better quality food at a higher end Mexican restaurant for the same price, and you don't get charged for salsa!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio, as a chain alternative to Chipotle & Baja Fresh, you rock. You have tasty, handmade tortillas. You often have mahi and regularly have wild-caught salmon. Your hot sauce selection is unrivaled. BUT, your UNLV location kinda sucks. The last 4 times I've been in, you've been \"out\" of salmon, regardless of the time of day--even on a day where you advertised your SPECIAL as fish tacos (um, take down the sign if you run out). You were entirely out of napkins in the entire shop on my last visit (and no staff offered a creative solution like, I dunno, a roll of paper towels?). And when I ask for a veggie burrito, a tortilla stuffed with rice & cheese doesn't cut it. The sign says \"guacamole\" is inside, but you never even offered it.  I think we're gonna have to break up."}
{"text":"I generally love Cafe Rio however some days their food is greasy and wet. I think that this place is a step up from fast food, also in pricing, but I don't think it's as good as restaurants. I still eat hear but I wish the workers were taught to drain liquid before putting it on the food."}
{"text":"On July 11th, I had my first Cafe Rio experience. Holly crap, I cannot believe what I was missing. I had no real clue what to get so I chose the award winning sweet pork barbacoa and had it in a quesadilla. Honest to goodness it was nearly orgasmic it was so good. By far the best tasting pork I have ever eaten in my 43 years. Cafe Rio has a new loyal fan. In addition, the fresh tortillas were out of this world as well. Over the weekend I brought some home for my wife to try who loved it just as much.    Wow.  This place is food gold.  Awesome.  If you have not been, you have to go!"}
{"text":"I've been to several different cafe rios in California and utah. This one is no exception! Food is on point and delicious!!   I got the pork salad and queso and chips today and they were both amazing!!  Love how they make quesadillas for the kids for free!  Right now they have a coupon for buy one get one free salad or burrito until the end of the month! You can find it online!"}
{"text":"I've had good experiences here. I normally order the tostada and walk out happy. It also seems healthy (not sure if that's a fact). It's under $7 and is quite filling. They have daily specials as well--basically you pay full price but get a free drink. Tried the chile relleno once (it's a one day special, can't remember the day though) and it was very good, too.  Note: the prices have gone up a bit. The tostada is about $6.50+tax now."}
{"text":"Have heard both good and bad about this location, the food tends to be quite good but can, on occasion, slide off quite sharply. The biggest problem I have seen at this location is that the staff can be rather caustic at times and that the customers seem to think that stealing from the restaurant is a groovy thing to do. Even something a seemingly minor as asking for a free water cup and then filling it with soda is something that can begin to affect a restaurant very quickly, causing prices to rise (which we hate) or problems for the restaurant, (which they hate).  Cafe Rio has good food, but we go to another location now, so should you."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I used to only be able to eat here when I was downtown at the Camelback location. As soon as I saw the sign during construction I was elated! Their food is great, their customer service is top notch, and the energy is electric. Thank you for finally building one a lot closer and more convenient to my home."}
{"text":"You either like salmon or you don't. Unless you don't know the difference.  A little effort to learn the differences ( color, placement location on the food line, label) in the part of employees should have would be appreciated.   We recently walked over following a haircut and I commented that this Cafe Rio has a huge hurdle that they can't overcome. Their location really was a poor decision on the part of business / franchise owners.  Parking appeared to be difficult, lots of COX trucks and Vans (dining at Buffalo Wild Wings) hot weary desert dwellers flocking into ColdStone Creamery.  Cafe Rio was empty. It was 1:pm on a Saturday.   I don't hate salmon. I just have to be in the mood for it.  Mahi was my other choice! I was really hungry for fish tacos.  The Salmon tacos she prepared for me weren't bad. They just weren't what I wanted or ordered. I wasn't going to mention it until my husband announced that the last couple of times he chose a dining option for us something went wrong.  (Hmmm maybe he needs to use YELP more) Taking the employee aside I pointed out on the receipt the mistake. I let her know,however,  I intended to finish them.  \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  And that was that.   I refilled my mint limeade!  And sat down, to finish my food. Let it be known Cafe Rio has the Best beverage options. Horchata, frescas, and more.   Before I'd taken another bite this still apologetic employee arrived and very eloquently apologized and made a very kind offer to restore my confidence and to improve the chance of my return business.  We spoke about the difference between the two types of fish. She was gracious and had indicated that the manager on duty had helped her to figure out how to handle the customer issue.   The salmon tacos were moist and full of flavor... Had I known I was getting salmon adding the avocado tomatillo sauce would have been ideal.    Partner enjoyed a pork burrito and found it much to his liking!"}
{"text":"My cousins took me here for the first time during the summer, and it was a lot better than I had anticipated it to be. Their burritos are HUGE. They are not skimpy on their meat, rice, beans, cheese, etc at all! They definitely give you your moneys worth. The line goes by pretty quickly. Seating can be a little hard to find, especially during lunch time (obviously). Can't wait to go back and get another burrito, enchilada style! YUM!"}
{"text":"Just went there to get your special for Monday Chile Rellenos and it's not even 3pm and they are out. I was told they are completely out for the day!! Why promote something and not have it.  I waited a couple of minutes to be acknowledged and no one was in front of me.  Not even a I will be with you in a moment.., bad service.  No one seems to care or smile."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is usually one of my go to places. But this location is absolutely horrible. 9 times out of 10 I will go in and they are either rude, obnoxious, out of things, or just slow.   I keep going to it because I live in the area and I hope it gets better. But it hasn't. It needs new management and a completely new staff."}
{"text":"We frequently visit this Cafe Rio and have never been skunked on the food. It is always hot and delicious! The chicken (shredded) and pork (spicy green chili and sweet) are all really good. The guac is extra, but worth it. I also really like that it is cafe style, so you tell them exactly what you want in your tacos, burritos, and nachos.  As other Yelp reviewers mentioned, when there is a line that wraps around it does take quite a while to get through it - sometimes 30 minutes, so be prepared to wait. Also, I'm not sure if it is still an issue since we've been getting food to go, but in the past the trash bins were often overflowing, tables needed to be wiped down, and they needed to restock supplies like lids for cups. Hopefully they've added enough staff to keep up with these housekeeping items in the restaurant.   Tips: Cafe Rio has a great rewards program so be sure to sign up for it (it's free). Also, save your receipt - at the bottom is a survey and once you complete it, you are given code that you can redeem on your next visit for either nachos or a dessert."}
{"text":"We stopped by on Taco Tuesday. My wife and I really liked the bbq barbacoa but the amount of meat that comes with the tacos are really small while the pico and lettuce are overflowing. I wish they gave a little more meat with the tacos. We also got chips and queso and we both really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"So I've been pretty bitter about them taking away my Qdoba, and I hoped Cafe Rio would make up for it but I just don't think it's gonna cut it. I had the enchiladas with green chile pork, compared to chipotle the flavors are great and there's definitely a wide variety to choose from... but as far as the whole assemble as you order thing, it didn't really work out. Everything just kind of got slopped together, including my rice and beans... so it looked more like a soup with some tortillas more than anything. They weren't really enchiladas as the tortillas pretty much just came apart and none of it was hot, despite them running it through a warmer. I had to ask for salsa, pico, lettuce and extra cheese on top, because it was just tortillas with meat and the tiniest bit of cheese with sauce thrown inside and more on top. The nachos would probably be good here, but I think I'll stick to authentic Mexican for everything else. The manager was great, super friendly and made sure we were happy before paying. I so appreciate the Stevia lemonade which was awesome, but I will forever miss my Qdoba."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. Long lines, unless you go just before closing. May be a little confusing for newbies as different people quickly ask you what you want on it to decide quickly, but then they have arbitrary limits on what they can put on it based on the options for your particular order. Nachos or a burrito is the most food, which I recommend."}
{"text":"Best Mexican chain in the area. If you get a salad, it's huge portions like 2 meals in one. They don't charge extra for guacamole like Chipotle does. The sweet pork is nice."}
{"text":"Food poisoning. That's all I have to say. I will never eat at this location or any other location ever again. I have a total taste aversion from this place. I got food poisoning 3 different times here.  The first time I didn't realize it was food poisoning. I thought I had a bug of some sort. I gave this place another go thinking it was just a one time thing but nope. Sick. Again. The third time was partially my fault because I shouldn't have given them my business again but I was in the area and really wanted some nachos. Now I know better. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my husband and I LOVE Cafe Rio. That being said this was our first time to this location since it is new. I walk in to place an order to go and the gal taking my order was in such a rush to get me down the line that I had to repeat the items I wanted multiple times because she wasnt listening. I told her I would be ordering two  meals to go  and after I told her what I wanted for the first meal she told me to have a nice day.  I told her I wanted flour tortillas for my enchiladas and she grabbed corn . So it took double the time just to get my order started. The guy at the end was clearly new and taking forever which wouldn't have been so bad if the girl who was supposed to be helping him was too busy making sure that the limes and cheese bins were filled to the top. So while he very slowly help the customers in front of me my food was sitting on the bench getting cold. Then he finally gets to me and I have to tell him that guacamole is two scoops not one. He looks to the cashier who confirmed. I don't usually nitpick but if I have to pay extra for guacamole then I want to make sure I get what I paid for it. The cashier had completely wrung me out and she stood there and watched him struggle for another 5 minutes trying to bag my food. Best location maybe closer but I don't think we will be back anytime soon. The one at Norterra is much faster and the service is better"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location three stars based on the grilled chicken salad and a couple of other items. If I were rating it on the staff I would give it a 1 star because of the 1 employee that was nice.    First off the other reviews on how terrible the customer service is at this locaton are completely right. They rush you through the line so fast that you don't get enough time to tell them what you want and what you don't want on your plate, then when you get something thrown on that you didn't want, they get so mad if you have the nerve to tell them you didn't want that.    I don't understand why the wait takes so long to  order because by the time you get helped you feel almost dizzy from the whirlwind of fast questions thrown at you. Its so bad that when I go there with more than two meals to order I litterally have to  rehearse my order so they don't get frustrated with me for taking up too much time. I hate it!   We have tried to order over the phone and thats a nightmare too! They always get something wrong on it and I'm not sure if there is a designated cashier for to go orders because I have sat there for at least ten minutes before someone even acknowledges that I am there.   Now that chicken salad.... we always get the grilled chicken salad with house dressing and its really yummy! A bit pricey but its a good size. I recommend getting a side order of the hot sauce which will run you another dollar but its great when I  pour a little on the salad too. The tortilla soup is also good. Another item that we get if you are not terribly hungry is a side salad, we order that with a side of grilled chicken and its also really good. The homemade tortillas are good enough to eat all by themselves. We really enjoy the food here I just wish the customer service was better because this is our closest location but we have no problem driving a little further for better service."}
{"text":"The staff behind counter rude. Kitchen area dirty. Staff cleaning dinning area very polite and appear happy to be there. Maybe these two ladies should train kitchen staff. Steak taco had to order it three times before the clown behind counter would stop and listen to how I wanted it. He assumed how I wanted it so that why he had to remake it three times. Finally got food it was ok."}
{"text":"Usually an okay experience - but I am getting fed up.  Called ahead for an order so my husband could pick up on his way home for us - said 30 minutes (it's 9:04pm when I call - not exactly peak business hours for a Monday night) but ok - he has to drive there.  He gets there at 9:30 and they haven't even started it and there is nobody in line.  He asks about it and they told him they have a few more minutes before it's \"late.\"  Really?  Whats the point of calling ahead?  Feel like they are getting lazy over there..."}
{"text":"If I could write a zero star review this would be it!!! I was coming to this cafe rio to meet up with my sister to grab a bit and catch up on everything. Going into this location I was stopped by a gentleman and his family whom where all ready dining there.  If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't believe it!!! He showed me and told me angry how his cheese cakes had RAT POO! WHICH it DID. I was in shock asked my sister if she had ordered yet which she said no I explained to her what I seen and why the gentleman was there arguing with the cashier. We left and outside I told him he should've took a picture to post on here. He said this location has cameras... So guess what you've now been warned!!!!"}
{"text":"DIRTY! I don't know what happened to this place, used to go hear all the time for lunch back in 2012-2013, and I just recently tried it again and OMG! I barely recognized it, first of all - Service sucks! A bunch of teenagers working and not paying attention to what they are actually doing, hanging out and being loud in the table area. Secondly, everything is dirty, from the stoves that are missing buttons and covered with dried grease, to the overfilling garbage cans with splatter on nearby items, to the floor, tables, drink station, I mean... Disgusting! Will never go back! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Damn!! I didn't think you could be this rude to someone. I was actually embarrassed by my server Adrianne. I don't know if it was me or something about me  she didn't like but, the person behind me in line got the polite side of her.   I will not come back to this place, I love great customer service but this was down right degrading to me. I've never been so embarrassed at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is line style like Chipotle...hop in line and place your order, follow your order making selections as you go. Casual dining and fresh tortillas made right in front of you. The only thing I order and ever plan on ordering is their salad. Yes, it may seem like a weird one to obsess over but this is Super Yum! Okay, so they start with a hot, fresh, thick, almost buttery tasting tortilla with melted cheese, then they add rice, your choice of beans, your choice of meat (I liked the steak or shredded chicken, now I don't eat meat), lots and lots of lettuce, a lime, crunchy tortilla strips, pico, guacamole, and more cheese. They have a spicy house cilantro ranch that has a kick and brings everything together! Say it with me now...Wowza! Your taste buds will be having a party all night. They also have loyalty cards so you can get a stamp for each entrée, working towards a free one."}
{"text":"this locations has serious issues. i drive out of my way for Cafe Rio to the one in centennial over the N. Decatur location. the quality and quantity at this lcation is sub par. if you make the food they way you would make it for yourself you will have happier customers."}
{"text":"CR is a fresh upgrade to the Chipotle chain experience.  Fresh ingredients and dancing cooks provide for a festive meal.  Highlight: steak salad with vinaigrette."}
{"text":"I am normally a cafe rio fan but this location is a joke!  Thirty minute wait at 8 pm and already out of chips and mild and medium salsa. They were so slow and the employees didn't seem to know what they were doing and were more distracted with the interactions with other employees than helping the customers.  There were so many employees and they all seemed to be having a great time. A dirty environment with food everywhere and employees wiping their faces and their clothes with gloved hands then back to preparing the food.  I will never go to cafe rio again."}
{"text":"MOST ANIMATED SERVICE EVER! I'm a teacher and I just walked into Cafe Rio on Gilbert and Ocotillo to get a sweet pork burrito (holy crap it's good). The service was totally outstanding for this late in the day! All smiles and positive vibes for sure. I teach ALL day and I see kind kids and not-so-kind kids; and by the end of the day, I am just about beat with all of the politeness to kids that are mean. I can imagine that it is extremely similar to working late into the day as these folks are. The young lady in front was gentle and all smiles. The next guy had me rolling as he commented on every single person, child and dog in line! He was unique and extremely upbeat. I suggest you visit this CR as it is a host to enter! I LIVE the smiles!"}
{"text":"Come here around 4:30 or 5 and they never have steak or chicken ready or cooked, Horchata is completely empty and they have 8-9 people working and nothing is ready for the dinner rush"}
{"text":"You guys have to staff this place for the business that walks in the door, the wait was over 40 minutes to order. You're never going to survive with such slow service."}
{"text":"Story time. The benefit of ordering online is to supposedly \"beat the rush\" by just coming in & picking up. Today I ordered online at 12:25pm and received a confirmation that says my order will be ready at 1:00pm. Cool! So I drive over & I walk in through the door at 1:15pm (don't like being one of those people who arrive on the dot and then are pissed its not ready). I walk up to the counter, the girl asks what I need -- I tell her, \"I'm here for pick-up, under Nikki order 889.\" She walks to an empty shelf behind her and yells, \"Nikki for pickup!\" Surprisingly nothing happens. She keeps ringing people up. A few minutes later, she again yells, \"Nikki for pickup!\" It seems the people in line are ordering & getting rung up, and I'm still standing here confused.   A few more minutes have passed, so she yells in the direction of the kitchen, \"Hey, can you do Nikki for pickup? Because she's already here.\" Already here? I ordered an hour ago. I felt like she insinuated I showed up early or something. But anyway... A guy eventually comes up & grabs a receipt from her with my order. He looks at me and says, \"I'll make it now. At least it will be fresh!\" Good save. Not. I'm watching people come & go that are in line... If I just got in line & ordered when I walked in, I would have gotten my food 5 minutes ago. It's 1:33 now and the guy hands me my food & says, \"She won't charge you.\" I said, \"I paid online though.\" And he goes, \"Oh.\" Shrugs his shoulders, crinkles up my receipt, throws it in the trash can & walks away. Huh. Almost got a free meal for the inconvenience, guys... almost.   Lastly, I ask the girl, \"Can I just get a stamp please?\" as I hold out my stamp card. She looks at me (a little annoyed I feel), looks away... a minute later comes up to me, takes my stamp card from my hand, stamps it, picks it up & just drops it on my food despite my hand being out to receive it. Mind you, no apology whatsoever through this whole ordeal... from anyone. I walk out at 1:37pm. What a weird encounter. I wish they gave the employees name tags so I could complain. But the bottom line? Preordered at 12:25, walked in 1:15, left at 1:37. Beat the lunch rush by ordering online? Is this still even considered lunch? \"AT LEAST IT'S FRESH.\" Lol, smh."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. The girl at the register did not great us, thank us for coming or anything! She actually didn't say anything to me until I broke the silence with, \"Hi, I got a pork salad.\" I know we can all have those days, but leave your baggage at the door and remember the industry you are in. Tried to get her name, but they don't wear name tags. Asked one person her name & he apologized stating she was relatively new so he didn't know her name. I asked another person working there & she said she wasn't sure but her name might be JESSICA. So if that is her name -- Jessica, I'm sorry you legitimately seemed angry for having to help us.   Aside from that, the line was also relatively long... waited at least 15 minutes to order. Felt like of all locations I've been to, this was also the most stingy with the meat. Food quality was decent though & that's what saves this review from being a 1 star rating. I have been to many Cafe Rio locations and have always been a fan of their food... It's just honestly a shame when the whole dining experience has to be trumped by people who clearly do not want to be working there and represent the company so poorly. I will honestly not be opting to eat at Cafe Rio if this is the area I'm around. In terms of what to order:  FOR HER: I always order the SWEET PORK BARBACOA SALAD. The meat is so flavorful -- I am not a pork eater but there is no contest in terms of what to order in my eyes at this place. Comes with rice, beans (black or pinto; none for me personally!), a generous amount of lettuce, pico de gallo, cilantro, grated cheese, a scoop of guacamole, a lime and corn chip strips. The creamy house dressing is straight crack! So good.   FOR HIM: He always gets the same thing too: a STEAK SALAD. A fan of the beans, he says its best to ask for the beans on the side -- as the liquid they're in tends to make the tortilla placed underneath and the rice very soggy. He also asks for half the house creamy tomatillo dressing and half of the cilantro lime vinaigrette so that he gets an even mix of both savory flavors. He also often orders an extra tortilla. They make them fresh & by hand, and you get 2 for $0.99!   Just do yourself a favor... Eat at a different location. ;)"}
{"text":"If you've eaten at the henderson location, dont eat at this one! So disappointed!  Yeah it looks the same, but it doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"This was rough.  It took over twenty minutes from the time I told the first employee \"one sweet pork salad\" to the time we ate.  Food was prepared nice, but was cold after it sat on the metal prep slide for 15 minutes.  Seriously, it took that long.  It was such a laugh."}
{"text":"It's a lot of food for the money.  We got the steak taco, chicken enchilada and pork enchilada platters.  We all enjoyed our food and the service was good.  We ordered the chips and queso but the queso was curdled and tasted \"off\" so they switched it for guacamole instead."}
{"text":"Food is pretty fantastic. I made an online pick-up order, and ended up having to wait 25 minutes once I got there because (I assume) they were short staffed. I could've gone through the line 3 times by the time I got my food. That being said, the cashier, Matthew, was very apologetic, gave me a free drink while I waited, and even ended up finishing my order because the food people were just too slow. He seemed more stressed about it than I was. I appreciate the great customer service and think he should get a raise. I will definitely be back, but probably won't order online."}
{"text":"LOVE cafe Rio food. But this location needs major work on their speed and organization. Communication is lacking. I waited 30 minutes for some kids quesadilas. I try to avoid this location but it's closest to my house."}
{"text":"Cage Rio's pork is to die for. I've been hooked for years and continue to crave it weekly. I didn't have much time for lunch so I called and ordered ahead. My pork tostada was ready and waiting."}
{"text":"Got there about 45 until closing....the restroom was closed already, no specialty drinks like horchata were available and it was f@#king freezing in there, like 50 degrees. Food was also limited as they started to wrap things up for the evening. Worst Cafe Rio I have been to."}
{"text":"Ok place as long as you never want the daily special after 7pm. Slow service, decent food."}
{"text":"We ordered over the phone because we knew there would be a long line and they said it would be ready in 30 minutes. We got there and they hadn't even started our food. We waited another 20 minutes until we got our food. We got home to eat and they didn't even give us salad dressing for our salads! Terrible location, go to a different one!"}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Rio based on a recommendation from a friend. I have to say the food we ordered was excellent. What made the experience a disappointment was how we were charged extra for sour cream on my tacos and cheese on my girlfriends burrito. My tacos were on the menu for 7.50 my girlfriend's burrito about the same, add chips/salsa and two sodas our bill rang up to $25"}
{"text":"When you've graduated from Taco Bell and it's too depressing inside an empty Roberto's, you're ready for Cafe Rio and its addictive fresh awesomeness.   Don't get me wrong: you won't forget the Los Tacos of the world, and I still love a good lunch at Mariana's. But Cafe Rio is wonderful. Big fan of both barbacoa and grilled salmon. Whole menu is great and worth the extra buck over your average fast-casual spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is our go too when we are tired and hungry. Grilled chicken sald, no rice! Great portion size, semi-healthy and if they only sold their house dressing by the bottle!  Only downside, there is usually a line. However, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Food is great we love The tortilla soup it's always been consistent however the staff looks like it's on a high turnover and sometimes they look like they don't know what they are doing it can get chaotic. Ice tea and lemon aid selection is the best!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple of times,  because it's my go to meal on the go, I usually order the taco salad with the whole wheat soft taco, it's my all time favorite,  but today i decided on the special Mahi Mahi fish tacos,  i totally enjoyed it, fish was fresh and i love the rice and beans, the drink order that comes with the meal is your choice of sodas but i got the mint limeade, it's sweet but i do enjoy it. I do agree that the customer service could be better, i always feel so rushed when i have to place my order. This location is the closest and convenient for me, so i am a regular here, I also love the free meal after you order 10..that's always a perk ."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice if you're looking for \"authentic\" American-Mexican food. Would recommend the sweet pork salad or anything with sweet pork! Their tortillas and ranch are excellent and the staff is very friendly. The restaurant can get a little dirty at times, though. Parking is always easy to find in the lot."}
{"text":"It's good. That's it. I don't see what \"stands out\" from similar establishments (i.e Chipotle, Qdoba) other than having a couple of lackluster items not offered at the others. But it's good."}
{"text":"I go here often simply because I live around the corner. I always order the salad. Several times they omit the guac on my orders. I say put in everything but if I dont watch they leave it out and dont find out until I'm home. When I asked does the salad come with gauc the guy responded \"Yes, did you want some?\""}
{"text":"I've been going here since it opened. Had another terrible experience today. The portion sizes have been steadily decreasing Over the past few months. Today my extra serving of steak was 4 slices of meat. They rang up my order without telling me what they were charging me for. I asked the manager to read me what she rang up. She charged me for 2 extra salsa (I get that instead of my dressing) she also charged for the single scoops of sour cream in the two tacos I got. I mean that's like olive garden charging you for spaghetti Sauce when you order spaghetti right. I mean the 2 tacos and salad was $30. That's not cheap for fast food and then you start skimping/up charging  on everything. I'll never be back!! Let's all go to quedoba!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First timer and most likely last timer. Came in around 1pm. I wasn't familiar with the concept so felt a bit lost. I asked a worker how it worked and rudely responded \"can't you see the menu behind you\". Secondly I started ordering a quesadilla with their new meat. Same worker rush me threw the line avoiding questions I had. Payed $11 for a greasy cheese quesadilla with spirits of meat. Another restaurant claiming to be Mexican when it isn't."}
{"text":"FYI IF A RESTAURANT CLOSES AT a certain time let the customers know they should stop coming in an hour or two before closing time.. Which is not a good thing...  Horrible appearance, customer service, and display of a professional establishment.. I arrived at 8pm to order my meal and 75-85% of the food was already taken away or ran out of.. I asked the staff if they were closed and they said at 9pm on Sunday's.. However, all Info says 10pm. Not sure why all of the food would be taken away if they are open for another hour or more. I asked if I was getting the end of the dressing since she poured the very last drop on to my salad and the staffs reply was that I was lucky to get any at all. I have been here numerous times and I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism and quality of food presented and served to several people in line.. I will be messaging corporate as well to let them know what's going on.."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio also does such a great job creating fresh tortillas and great tasting meats for their burritos. My go to burrito is their sweet pork, enchilada style. The sweet pork is flavorful with a lot of sauce they gives it the right amount of tang. Make sure you do yourself a favor and get all your burritos enchilada style; their burritos are already good on their own, but the extra sauce and cheese makes it that much better.   This new location is great. It gives another quick food option in the area. Especially good for the dental students and staff at UNLV and at UMC."}
{"text":"Frequented this location since it opened...initially it had lots of promise but it continues to slide down that slippery slope of carelessness, indifference, and apathy that many restaurants get when staffed with minimum wage teenagers who don't care one bit about the job they're doing...fast food restaurants should learn from places like In-N-Out and Chipotle when it comes to the people they hire...but alas, you get what you pay for and the Cafe Rio franchise is getting back what they invest in their personnel...nothing!"}
{"text":"Pork nachos here are bomb! Restaurant is close to home and staff is decently friendly. Only bad feedback is that the bathroom was kind of dirty."}
{"text":"Placed an online order last night at 7:42pm, the order said it would be ready at 8:15pm. When I arrived I was told the computer was backed up and that I had to wait. There was 2 other people waiting to pick up their online orders. I did not receive my order until 8:30pm. The young man assisting me was kind enough to offer me a drink due to the wait. The food was luke warm at best. It had to be reheated before we could eat. I have been eating Cafe Rio for such a long time, even before it came to Vegas but the last few experiences have not been good, the service and food have really gotten bad. Sadly, I think this will be my last trip to Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"So the point of mobile ordering is to save time in line, be able to walk in, get your food, pay and be on your way right? It's so convenient for people that are \"on the go.\" I place and order at 6:32... they selected my pick up time to be 7PM which was the earliest; fine whatever. My boyfriend & I go at 7 to pick up our food & they didn't even make the ladies food in front of us yet and their pick up time was 6:50! It's now 7:31 and my boyfriend asks again. How much longer... and the guy says \"oh your orders been done, I thought it was part of a larger order\" ... you've got to be kidding. Not only did you waste our time, but the whole mobile service that is supposed to be quick & easy is just dumb. Might as well have waited in line.  UPDATE: that food wasn't ours, we waited 45 minutes to finally get our food and our order was wrong!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food, their quesadillas and nachos are  especially delicious and they have great service. Their prices are the best."}
{"text":"Not good.  I ordered a vegetarian burrito, which the menu/sign claimed came with guacamole.  Unfortunately, not only did I not get the guacamole, but there was literally nothing but rice and beans in my \"vegetarian\" burrito.  No onions, peppers, napolitos, or any kind of vegetable. No tofu or veggie-meat option. Just rice and beans with a small sprinkling of cheese on top.  I returned to the counter to ask about this, and they gave me about a tablespoon of brown guacamole.  All of this was $9.  When I went to grab a drink, the machine sprayed liquid on me, and wouldn't turn off - continuing to overflow... I ran to the counter to grab something to catch the running beverage, and to let the workers know what was going on... the response was \"yeah, that one does that. It'll turn off eventually.\" The overfilled cup and liquid on the floor were still there when I left 20 minutes later.  Bland, boring food. Apathetic staff. In a town that seems to have a Roberto's or some other authentic taco shop on every corner, I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat here."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, but this specific location is the worst Cafe Rio ever. They are almost always out of certain foods and don't accommodate or try to make up for it. They always give you way less food compared to other Cafe Rio's. The staff are almost always very slow and sometimes rude and irritated with you for some reason. I have been here about 10 times because it is closer, but every time I am very disappointed and wish I would of gone to the one on Stephanie which I never have complains about."}
{"text":"Love the tortillas (one of my favorite) but the food consistency needs to be worked out."}
{"text":"I used to order the chicken burrito enchilada style with the green mild salsa but lately the green sauce is atrocious.  Did they change the recipe because it is definitely not what I've order the last few years. Used to be one of my top 5 but now I won't even bother going"}
{"text":"I have been to cafe rio on Stephanie never a problem excited because this one is close to my house, ordered a cheese  enchilada and taco total confusion on line and just in general rude! Sat down enchilada was cold on the inside so I ask them to warm it and the manager took it and threw it in the trash remade it and took so long now my taco was cold so my husband takes my taco up and the the manager mumbles something rude under her breath about remaking it and when my husband ask for the manager she throws a business card at him and says that's me! The dining room is freezing! Won't go back to this one till they make some changes! They really need a new manager!"}
{"text":"Refusing to serve Police offers has just been the final Taco at your business! Shame on you!! I have given a bad review on one of your other locations so this is no surprise that you run this company the way you do! Only giving 1 star because it won't let you continue without it!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to cafe rio.  The food is fair +.  The service is fast bit maybe a little too fast as the workers won't even look at you when you're talking. I was in line trying to order and the lady asked me what I would like and I told her but it wasn't what she wanted to hear so she ordered what she thought I said.  I tried correcting her and it was so loud I gave up.  The whole idea of customization is thrown out the door when the employees can't even look up when they are asking you questions."}
{"text":"Great food and always great customer service! Awesome fresh quality every time. Mobile order pickups aren't as priority as walk ins but quality is still very consistent. Hands down my favorite Cafe Rio location in town"}
{"text":"Good quality, clean and quick. I always get the shredded chicken burrito, dry with the hot sauce on the side and add sour cream. I usually only can eat half so I reheat the other half the next day in the oven and its just as yummy"}
{"text":"When I heard the name Cafe Rio I didn't expect RIO-flying cockroaches!!! Wtf!! Ugh they're overpriced...and overall, the food was horrible. Went outside to enjoy the evening until I kept feeling what I thought was a napkin on my foot. Boy was I wrong... because it was a cockroach...... That flies. Never going back. Only thing good was their horchata -__-"}
{"text":"I've been to several locations in Nevada and they are essentially all the same. The food (mainly, their house dressing) tastes great on a salad. That is what kept me coming back for quite some time. However, the negatives far outweigh the good at this point. First, the line is always horrendous. I'm not sure why this hasn't been addressed by management or corporate. Something is clearly wrong with the organization and the method in which they are preparing the food if the line is constantly backed-up. Second, the attitude of the workers is, generally speaking, horrible. They roll their eyes, reach over/breathe on the food, and they don't want to listen to the customer if he or she wants specific items on his/her salad. I'm not sure what the point of the employee building the salad is if they aren't very welcoming to the fact that I only want specific items on it. They act as though it's a huge hardship to put anything other than the generic \"everything\" on my salad. I hope people continue to gripe about the line and the service, because I think Cafe Rio is very profitable and this allows Corporate or Management to turn a blind eye (or they are just unaware). Good food, bad service. Count me out for good."}
{"text":"This really sucks to say...how can you love a place and so so pissed...you know..you love a places food and sometimes just wanna get it as take out...if you want it right dont bother calling it in or online where you specifically them them what you want. This has happend so many times. Guess im stuck standing in that god aweful line. Then again there's always costa vida"}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service today was terrible. I wasn't busy and the staff were miserable and screwed up my salad order twice."}
{"text":"Great good, great vibe, great location!   Salad with chicken and cilantro dressing = bomb!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time going to Cafe Rio. We waited in line maybe 10 minutes, which is good compared to how long my mom and brother said they had to wait the last time they were there - 40ish minutes! They were out of medium and mild sauce, and so my mom (who has a very low tolerance for spicy food) was forced to get the \"hot\" sauce (they also have a \"hotter\" sauce) for her burrito. Fortunately for her, it wasn't spicy AT ALL, and she agreed. I don't know how much less spicy it could get for the medium and mild sauces. My brother also got a burrito, but they didn't give him any salad on the side that it's supposed to come with. I ordered a quesadilla and it says on the menu that it comes with guacamole and sour cream. I got rice and beans instead of salad and they said that because I made that substitution, they had to charge me for the quac and sour cream even though it said on the menu that the quesadilla comes with those things! If there are exceptions, that should be written on the menu and/or told to you before it comes time to pay and it's too late. Also, there was hardly any rice in the pan and so the guy was basically scraping at the bottom to give me all the hard, clumped up pieces of rice. There was food EVERYWHERE, and it places it wasn't supposed to be. The foods in the pans were mixed up with each other.  Orders got out of line and so they were asking the customers \"is this yours?\" and it's hard to say for sure because you can't tell what's on the inside from the outside. I got a smile only from the cashier - all the other workers were not friendly - slow, very low energy, and didn't seem to want to be working there. I wouldn't either because of how much a mess the place was.  They need some serious training and better management. The food was okay but the experience and customer service was terrible!"}
{"text":"Met some friends over here at cafe rio and had a fun lunch.  The environment was very home like.. Fun music and the design of the place feels live.   The order was incredibly quick. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, checked my phone for a second, looked up and my food was ready. Lol.   The food is Amazeballss. It wasn't the best I've had but for the price, it was delicious. And they got my favorite hot sauce too! Cholula!!   The horchata deserves a 5star."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Gilbert location but being that the Red Mt location just opened up I decided to try it.  I ordered through the mobile app for convenience and when I picked up the food I should of checked but trusted it was correct.  I got home to find out my order wrong: missing rice and beans on a taco combo and the rice on my steak salad was raw and annoying to eat.  I called to let them know about the missing food and was advised to take my receipt on my next visit. Honestly I don't think I'll be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The food is awesome , the service is fkin horrible. Have been to this location over 10 times and all but one time there is a massive line that takes 20 min if not more to get thru.  The staff is slow as dirt and has no sense of urgency ..the fat Mexican lady I've never seen someone move so slow and do it so miserable looking..she slows down the entire line because her Co workers can't get around her. The staff is  all just talking and joking around and taking there sweet ass time ..oblivious to the line that stretches to the door. Went there today early and avoided the line so I was excited...I was the only person at the window and this kid comes up to assist the lady that was doing perfectly fine making my two orders and proceeds to Fuck both of my orders up..having to remake them..the second time he Fucked up one burrito again and had to be re made and then gives me an attitude and proceeds to talk shit on me to the lady in Spanish. I ordered two chips and queso and only got one..they were out and was told by this awesome douchebag that it would take 25 minuets for them to heat up cheese.   Great food service is some of the worst I've ever seen. Will go to the one in aliante from now on...done with this location and their sorry ass staff."}
{"text":"I just never get tired of this place.   Cafe Rio takes Chipotle's concept and puts it on steroids. Juicier meat, tastier sauces and dressings, and faster and friendlier staff.   I most often order the salad which includes your choice of meat (shredded or grilled chicken, grilled steak, or barbacoa), your choice of beans (black or pinto), rice, lettuce, pico, guacamole, lime wedge, cilantro, cheese and tostada chips. You also get your choice of dressings, the creamy cilantro is to die for!  My favorite part of this is the chicken. I always get the shredded chicken and it is deliciously moist and packed with flavor.   My husband orders the shredded chicken nachos, and he loves that they sing a silly song when he does. It makes me laugh every time.   They give our daughter (11months old) a free quesadilla. This probably doesn't seem like much but as a parent who's been charged over and over for food that is inevitably going to end up on the floor, I totally appreciate it!   The tortillas here are handmade (you can watch them do it) on site and they are so good! Sometimes I come in and just take one to go as a snack (though I would not recommend during lunch or dinner rush).   It's the little things that take a place with good food and make it a great restaurant. This place has got it all and that is why I keep going back."}
{"text":"Meh.   Stopped in for a quick lunch. It was not busy at all but I still had to wait a few minutes before anyone addressed me in line. I was the only one...   I ordered the special which was a chicken tostada and a drink.  The employee helping me seemed pretty disinterested in being there. She asked what beans I wanted and did I want chicken  then proceeded to dump a ton of beans and liquid on top of the corn crispy tortilla. When it was time to add the lettuce I said just a little lettuce. I got a ton!  She said is that okay and my reply was I guess if that's just a little. She also put a handful of cilantro - which is fine I like cilantro - but it was whole stalks of cilantro. It wasn't chopped and the stems were still intact. Weird. Guess I'm eating a salad today. Also she wouldn't look at me when talking so I couldn't hear anything she was saying. I had to keep asking her to repeat things since she was just looking away... At the cashier I had to wait another couple minutes again while the cashier wiped trays. Weird again- it's lunch time - could you please ring me up?! Got an iced tea for my beverage it tasted like it had been sitting for a while - it wasn't fresh. Tried the mint lemonade instead. That was actually really good.   The chicken had a good flavor but of course my tostada shell was soaked and soggy. I had to pick out a lot of the cilantro stalks and through all the lettuce to get to the good stuff.   I might say I'd give them another chance but this experience was so 'whatever' I don't think it'd be worth it."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say but this place sure changed! I tried twice in the past four weeks. I wonder if there is a new manager. Anyhow, the food containers are very messy. The queso used to be so good, and it still is at other locations. But here the queso is like a thin kind of something. I returned it twice because it is too liquid and is like flaky. The staff says that is the way it is. When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told she will be back in 30 minutes, and there is nobody else to talk to. Good thing is, there are other locations..."}
{"text":"I have been to two other Cafe Rio locations and food have always been great.  This location, maybe because it is a newer location so needs more time to work out all the kinks.  I was very disappointed in our foods.  We had ordered a chicken salad, chicken burrito with enchilada sauce, and nachos.  The nachos were decent!  The rest of the food, were dry and bland.  I will drive a little out of my way for the other busy Cafe Rio location instead in the future."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and amazing. The service, not so much. I am never greeted with a smile but rather rushed through and these employees seem to think they can predict what you want on your food and slap it on there until the words can escape your mouth. Sahara location is much better."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. Not very flavorful. I don't think I would choose to eat here before any other Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went today for Taco Tuesday and got 2 tacos, rice and beans for $6. My son got a free nino quesadilla which was nice. The chile beef and sweet pork are both very good. The rice and beans were flavorful. My favorite thing was the fresh tortilla it's on, so good! The restaurant was crowded but the line moved quickly and there were clean tables available. I can't speak to customer service as we had no problems but we will definitely be back for the food."}
{"text":"This is by far the most disgusting place I've ever seen. The line they were working on was a disaster. Stuff was everywhere. Meat was being carelessly flung everywhere and even into the veggies.  My boyfriend told them that he didn't want rice after she scooped it onto his place, so the worker dumped the rice back into the container with the meat juice that was on his plate and everything. What if a vegetarian went to get some rice but they got pork juice instead? The workers were also extremely rude. I asked a few simple questions because I am gluten intolerant and they just looked at me as if I was stupid.  The guacamole was complexly brown.  It just looked like no one cleaned the place for days. I will never return to this place again!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT when it first opened. I know they bring in their superstars to get it up and running but its never been the same. The portions are not consistent and nobody seems to know what the other is doing. Sometimes I feel like I am in the twilight zone like they seriously have no idea how to work as a team. I have gone 3 times in the last 4-5 weeks, each time hoping its better but its not. They have a great selection of drink but most times the ones made on site are empty with a gross fuzzy haze swirly around the dispenser. I do like the rewards program but wont be going back so that doesn't matter anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food but your staff needs to slow down just a bit. Couldn't understand then and it was my first time there BUT I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. Service was nothing to rave about. There's just nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, visiting from NM and a friend suggested the Cafe Rio, at first I was a bit skeptical but WOW!  Staff were a bit frantic and unorganized but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Great salad !! Had the burrito and it was yummy also . Fire roasted Chicken and steak are my favorite"}
{"text":"The manager at this place is very unprofessional. Our cashier Alex was very friendly and polite. She was being cold and a bitch to him because he forgot to do check out under her name or something like that . The manager went to like the kitchen area and the cashier looked ashamed, followed her to the back and they took a long time. We were just waiting there. Very unprofessional of the manager to do that. I mean if she wants to coach the staff on things there are ways you know. But her bitchy, unapproachable attitude and the way she treated the cashier not to mention the delay was just unacceptable . She can do a better job and show better leadership skills.  Not coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"The food is really fresh tasting & there is a lot that you can choose from. In my experience getting salads, make sure you watch how much they give you. The employees are extremely stingy. I'm paying nearly $10 for a salad, I should be getting what I'm paying for. Also, I feel as though the employees aren't trained properly. They never look or act like they know what they're doing. 90% of the employees are rude and disrespectful. The attitude they give is horrendous! Bottom line, food is good & the staff is terrible."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat for quick good food whenever I need to eat. I can eat here everyday if I wanted. Their steak salad is the best thing to eat here"}
{"text":"Shredded Pork Salad....I dont think there is a better salad out there....  Taco Tuesdays are my favorite. Tacos are only $1.50 each. You can stuff your face, and fill your husband up for about $5 a person!"}
{"text":"Had the sweet pulled pork Tostada,  it was so good,  I just wished there was more of it on my Tostada.  You get your choice of toppings like Lettuce,  beans,  rice,  salsa,  guacamole,  cheeses.  There's chips and salsa,  the chips are warm and crunchy. Salsas are fair not too spicy."}
{"text":"Ate here today, b/c it seemed like a real popping spot full of people when we actually ate next door the previous day. It was a little disappointing. I guess I ordered the most popular burrito, the Sweet Pork Barbacoa which don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't as impactful to me. I ordered the burrito, with sweet pork, enchilada style with green sauce in and out, the presentation was good, price was roughly like 8$ I think, pretty standard, but I got the feeling that the sweet pork was a little TOO sweet as I couldn't get to finish the burrito b/c I got kind of tired of the sweetness? I hope you can understand what I'm saying. I was impressed that they have like a crap load of hot sauces mounted on the wall to choose from, but I tried using some with the sweet pork and the tastes just don't mesh well together. So i'd just skip it. This place was alright, but if I'm going out to Vegas I've got better options to hit up..."}
{"text":"I came in and ordered a green enchiladas entree with black beans and rice and a salad for my niece. Our food was delicious. They also give free quesadillas for kids under 6 years old which is great! Got one for my son. They have a drinks bar with so many choices. I tried their horchata and mint lemonade. The horchata was good. A little on the sweet end but with lots of ice it was still good. The mint lemonade was soooo good! Reminded me of a mojito lol. Two thumbs up from us. Will come back."}
{"text":"This place has the best service. Every time we come in all of the workers are super happy and they engage with all of their customers. We love the happy greeting we get and the food is great and it's always super clean"}
{"text":"My first time here and probably my last. It really is not very good. It's definitely not mexican. It's as mexican as Taco Bell. But I rather go to Taco Bell. I got the steak salad. It was good but it's just very normal. For $10? That's too much. I can easily make it a home. The good thing I have to say about this place is that the ranch lemon sauce for the salad was delicious. I would buy a bottle of it. If I HAD to come back I wouldn't mind eating this again. But my mom got the burrito and she ate my salad with me because she hated the burrito. It was Barbacoa. The meat was pretty good. But that sauce. The sauce they put on top was so gross. One of the worst I've ever tasted. Completely ruined the burrito. I also tasted the rice and it was super bad. I only wanted to try it so I asked for a little in my salad. I had to take it out because not even my would would eat it and she eats almost anything.  I would never come again unless I had to. And I would eat the salad with the awesome sauce."}
{"text":"First and last visit. While ordering I asked 3 times for rice and beans on the taco and they kept saying it was later down the line. Ok? So they skipped the sauces I had to ask that they go back and put on the sauces I'd already asked for. They were very rude. She got mad that I wanted tomatillo sauce and apparently put it on the outside of my taco. They asked if I wanted pico de gallo and when I said no they wrapped it up. Had to make them unwrap it to put on cilantro and Cojita. I asked again about the rice and beans on the taco and they put it on the side. When I sat down to eat it my taco was complete mush and full of stems. By far the worst taco and experience I've ever had. Will not be back."}
{"text":"When I first tried Café Rio was completely addicted to their fire grilled chicken salad and I still am today. I love the vinaigrette dressing as opposed to the house. This particular Café Rio has definitely gotten chintzy with the servings of meat they place in the salad. I suppose I continue to go because it is convenient to work, but in the last six months, I definitely go less often because the quality of my salad is not quite what it was six months ago.  If you are in a hurry, you definitely do not want to go to this particular location at noon. Parking is difficult and the line can be very long. Calling and in order to pick up at noon does not gain much.  I have tried this approach only to find my order was wrong.  The staff is not always friendly. I seem to be just short enough to not be able to yell over the glass what and how I would like my order to be, which seems to irritate the person serving me. While I understand they cannot hear me well, they certainly shouldn't be irritable because it's not my fault. I cannot be the only one with this problem, so maybe they should consider a different ordering method. I have not tried other locations, so I can't say that being chintzy with the meat on my salad is standard for all of their restaurants. What I do recommend is if you happen to go to this location, order the burrito, a comes with plenty of meat!"}
{"text":"Yummm, wish we had one closer to our house.  It's a little bit pricey for an order at the counter type restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my clients order catering for their group from this Cafe Rio location. They delivered on time, had an efficient set up, and plenty of food for 40+ people. After their group went through they offered the extras to our staff and we were all very impressed. The chicken and steak were well seasoned. The rice, beans, and salad were delicious. Everyone LOVED the salad dressing (I even put it on my tacos). I will recommend Cafe Rio to all upcoming groups!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I am so annoyed, I was so excited to come have a tortilla soup. First, the girls working had no idea what they were doing maybe train your staff before letting them go by themselves. I got my soup and it was cold. The manager literally took it out of the cup and put it in an aluminum container and ran it through the tortilla oven thing. My chips were all soggy and he gave it back to me like that. I cant even believe it . Instead of just giving me a new one. I'm appalled and it's ruined my night. I'm never coming back to this cafe rio."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is great. They offer fresh produce with their food at a great price. Their Barbacoa (pork) is quite tasty and great in the tostada."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this Cafe Rio to go in right next to my house. I love Cafe Rio, I go at least once every week or two, but this location needs some new management! Every time I go I'm disappointed because they are out of multiple items! I cannot remember the last time I went to this location and my husband and I were both able to get exactly what we wanted. Tonight by 7:15pm they were out of shredded chicken and tamales, and the salad I ordered was served on a small pile of iceberg lettuce... Occasionally when I go they will have a sign on the door saying exactly what they are out of which is helpful so I know not to bother even going in, but many times they don't, so I'll get to the front of the line and start ordering just to find out they don't have what I want, and by then it's too late to leave since they are already making the plate!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. I thought this place was really solid. I came in with Angela and ordered the nacho plate while she ordered two tacos and shared one with me. It's all you can drink, you self-serve at the fountain and when they're making your food, you can totally ask for extra whatever and they'll throw it in gratuit! So I had extra salsa and guacamole with my nachos and it was really solid. Their tortillas they hand make from scratch and you can really tell the difference. Their really solid. This place is definitely way then any other chain Mexican place."}
{"text":"We ordered three entrees for pick up.  Two of the three entrees were wrong.  Chicken tacos instead of pork tacos.  Guacamole on my daughters pork salad when we asked for no guacamole.  I am unhappy. I'm home now and am stuck with it.  Btw - the receipt has the correct order."}
{"text":"Food is good. Workers try and rush you through the line and are unfriendly unless you speak Spanish. No queso made. One worker told us 10 minutes then another told us 15. I asked which was right and he responded, \"whatever man, as long as it takes\"."}
{"text":"I like this place its not Authentic mexican food if thats what you are expecting you are an idiot , food is good and i like it not so impress with the youngtas working there tho they slack the lady that cleans can be more helpful than the kids working in the kitchen ."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars to the people in the back prepping the food which is actually dilish, I really love.  But the employees on the line WHO ARE SERVING have bad attitudes !! Especially the girls I always feel rushed and they roll their eyes it's annoying and makes me feel uncomfortable   I'll always go and get my delish salad but the services sucks !"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I've given this place over 4 tries now, and each time it seems to get worse. For a 10+ dollar burrito you would think you would get some quality. They put your burrito together like your in line at the soup kitchen. They just throw your beans and rice in, and half the time they don't even listen and rush you through the line. Twice now, I haven't even gotten what I wanted. Only thing good in this place is the tortilla, but that's not worth over 10 bucks.   Update!  So after giving this place one last shot, I was very impressed. Seems like they have a completely new staff. The new staff actually listens to your order, and they did not rush me through the order process."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, decent value. Drinks are not always stocked, they don't have corn tortillas half the time I come there and there were bugs in the lettuce last time I was there."}
{"text":"Instead of writing a review for a chain that I'm familiar with and typically enjoy, I'm going to write the dialogue of my experience.  Setting the stage with me and 3 colleagues waiting in line:  Colleague 1:  I'd like a beef burrito Loud guy behind counter:  We don't have beef!  We have steak! Colleague 1:  Okay..steak.  Corn tortilla please Loud guy behind counter:  Steak burrito!  Beans? Colleague 1:  Yes, black beans.  Corn tortilla please Loud guy:  Hot or mild? Colleague 1:  I'll have that one (points), the fresh salsa Loud guy:  That's pico de gallo! Collague 1:  Okay..that (by the way...he ended up with a flour tortilla anyway)  Loud guy:  NEXT!  (extra loud as if I'm not standing 29 inches in front of him) Me:  Can I have salmon in a burrito? Loud guy:  YES!  We have salmon! Me:  Okay...salmon burrito please Loud guy:  salmon-ay por favor!  (I'm pretty sure Spanish for salmon is salmón...no \"ay\") Loud guy:  BEANS?!!!!! Me:  yes, white please Loud guy:  WE DON'T HAVE WHITE BEANS, WE HAVE Me, interrupting loud guy:  PINTO BEANS! (and I pronounced it PEEN-toe in my best Spanish accent) Loud guy:  Hot or mild (now not as loud) Me:  Salsa roja and pico de gallo Loud guy:  wet style right?  (then just pours enchilada sauce on before I answer) Me:  Sure (as if I have a choice at this point)  By then, I think he was annoyed with me and just sent my burrito down to the next gal to add lettuce, sour cream and rice.  Look...I get it that some of us come from culturally diverse backgrounds and enjoy bringing the heritage to the workplace where it's appropriate.  But c'mon dude... Caucasians in the Southwest typically understand the ingredient list at Latin cuisine establishments.  I like Cafe Rio, but I think I'll pass on this one next time and get a sub sandwich where they don't care if you ask for yellow peppers, banana peppers, hot peppers, or just point.  They get it.  Just make my food!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and I am big on taco salads so that's what I got , very delish. The dressing is bomb and my chicken was really juicy, I had enough food to have lunch the next day. My husband got a carne asada burrito and it was gigantic. A little pricy but you get your money's worth with the amount of food you get. Check it out and see what you think!"}
{"text":"I really like Cafe Rio as a whole, but this location is awful.  It used to be great, but now the line always seems to be extremely long.  Tonight they gave me half of the special I ordered.  It's so loud that you have to shout to order.  I've noticed they have started to skimp on portions.  My daughter's quesadilla had hardly any cheese at all, it was practically just a toasted tortilla folded in half.  The guy in front of me ordered extra meet on his tostada.  They initially were not going to do it, saying that it comes with 2 oz of meat and that's plenty.  The employee next to him finally added the extra meat.  The MINT limeade didn't have any MINT in it.  This place used to have great customer service, even when it was busy.  It has gone down hill lately, big time!  I fully recommend Cafe Rio, just not this location!!!"}
{"text":"Long lines. Unprepared. Horrible customer services. Opens at 10:30 and went there at 11 but they don't have grilled chicken yet. How? Aren't they supposed to have everything ready before it opens?"}
{"text":"I'm changing my review to four stars.  I admit the employees still need a lesson on smiling and what not, but the food is really good.  Everything is very freshly made and prepared and it is obvious.  We eat there probably three times a week now.  We always play \"rock paper scissors\" to see who has to go in and order because it does take awhile to get through the line if it's busy, but it has always been exceptional quality food .  I know they make everything fresh and it takes a little longer to get your items.  I think the young staff are stressed because they know it takes so long and I think with these yelp reviews, people take it out on them. But the management is ultimately responsible for the place and how smoothly it is run. But again I will say, the food has always been delicious and consistent."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  Lived in Vegas for a year and went all the time just recently moved back up to Seattle and miss the heck out of it.  Always got the pork barbacoa salad.  So so good!  Staff are also very helpful and seem to be having a good time.  Its quick and fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing Pork salad!!! I could eat this meal everyday.  Come to Seattle please!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining there.  It has a Chipotle style of food creation to it, but with better options and flavors I felt!  CRAZY busy for lunch being right across from UNLV, so walking in to this I could only assume that it was this busy because it was that good! I went there with a friend, we both got cheese enchiladas, hers with mild sauce, mine with medium.  Both lunches and two sodas came to $20, so right on track with what I was wanting to spend.   I had the complimentary condiments added (rice & beans, pico, sour cream, guac)...my friend said no...but then decided at the cash register that she wanted the sour cream.  For some reason her enchiladas were $1.10 more than mine plus an add on of $1.00 for a side of sour cream.  I didn't realize this til I looked at the receipt later.  I'm not tryna complain about $2, but that is the ONLY reason why I dropped a star, just the accuracy at the register. Otherwise, the order-taker/creators were great, smiles all around, and knowledgeable.  Nice atmosphere and had Coca-Cola products with Coke Zero, Diet Dr. Pepper, and Horchata...yum!!"}
{"text":"Our food looked disgusting. My husband got a taco salad and they threw a soft shell in a bowl and dumped watery black beans and rice on top. In the bowl they threw half a lime that was then buried under other food so my husband had no idea it was there until he took a big bite into the rind. Food was not good. My first time ever eating at cafe rio and I will not be going back. I'm not sure how that place is even open."}
{"text":"Yuck! Line was long, service was atrocious at best, and the food was terrible. The serving line was filthy, food from one container was thrown into another container, it was not wiped down and everything looked like it had been sitting out for hours. I felt like I was at a school cafeteria.  I ordered a side of steak and two tortillas, both were dried out and cold. The poor employees were so confused, disorganized and appeared to be disoriented! One time was enough. No returning for me!"}
{"text":"This used to be my family's go to place to eat. We ate there a couple of times a week sometimes. Over the past couple of years we have started driving out of the way, further, to a different location because EVERY time we go in to the one on N Decatur there's a problem. Sometimes it's something small like they're out of the tea I like, which is acceptable on rare occasions. Unfortunately, it's not always small and it's not rare. The service is terrible, they don't listen or pay attention and have you repeat the same things  over and over, then usually still get something wrong. They're consistently out of something we request, like tonight...chips. Seriously, how are you a Mexican place with no tortilla chips? Last time they had no steak, the time before no grilled chicken. It's really ridiculous. We won't be back to that location again, and aren't likely to keep going out of the way to the other."}
{"text":"Unbelievable how bad the service is here.  Place my order with the first person in line and then order is taken over by another server who is not listening to the first person.  So I have to order everything over again, one fish taco meal, two chile beef tacos, chips and salsa-queso.  Pretty straightforward and simple, but they don't listen to you. I was asked twice if I wanted cheese on the tacos, I said yes but somehow it never made it to the tacos.  When I noticed that the server was placing everything in one container, I reminded her that the fish taco was a meal..  She told me don't worry about it, my jaw is still wide open after hearing her talk to me like that!  Now I get to the cashier and she asks me for the whole order once again.  I still don't have my sides of rice and beans or the chips or salsa.  The cashier has to ask Don't worry about it for the rice and beans and chips and salsa, amazing.  So now I get the side dishes in a to go container, and she has to ask me if I want another container.  I say yes, because miss don't worry about it did not put it together as a meal.  After I pay for this mess, we go to our table.  The cashier tells me she forgot to ring up my chips and salsa-queso, but I show her the receipt with chips and salsa only rang up.  She tells me don't worry about it, and this time I dont! The worse thing about the whole episode is that the food was horrible to boot.   One thing they will not have to worry about is me coming back to this place!!!"}

{"text":"I was so excited about my 11th free meal but until tonight i felt so offended by this guy Kevin. We ordered our usual and the fun part begin...... at the register, first the lady at the register is not with it, and here comes Kevin questioning what we order, not one time but several.... and i kept repeating myself \" chicken salad \" n \" chicken burrito \", and than he pulled all our sides (dressing etc... ) out, and counting how many we have, i mean really dude?? first is with the chicken shit, and now he is counting my dressing???and to top it off, they were out of rice.  If you really trying to do your JOB right, listen/watch, don't question us like we are criminal and shit.... super not happy at all!!!  But i def love the lady who prep my food and Jordon the cashier, they always take care of me and my husband."}
{"text":"Ah, the oxymoron known as the \"pork salad\". I travel all over Vegas looking for the best. I enjoy Chipotle and Zaba's enough, but I get superior quality and unbelievable portions at Rio. When I have friends stay from out of town, you can bet I take them here. They simultaneously love me for taking them and hate me for the knowledge that they don't have a Cafe Rio in their hometown. Hehe.  Start with the base--the tortilla. They are homemade, warmed up for you as soon as you order, and stay soft all the way through your meal. I order my Barbacoa pork salad (all hail the sweetest and most moist pork around). My man gets a dual-protein burrito which is the size of a newborn and takes him two sittings to finish. The Mahi Mahi tacos are excellent too, as a side note.   What I love so much about the service is that these guys don't run you down the line like cattle, which I've felt a part of at Chipotle during the lunch rush. Too many times at Chipotle I watch my bowl fly down the line away from me as I yell out \"I'm sorry...would I like what?!?! Oh, salsa! Mild please...\"   When they ask you which dressing you would like, just say \"house\". I think it's avocado ranch and I could drink it from the cup. A perk of Rio is that horchata is served here. My salad is so massive and rich, though, I can't even finish IT, let alone chase it with sweet rice milk.   Bottom line: if you're going to pay $7-$9 for one of these meals (and you will pay that no matter where you go) make it worth your while and just come to Cafe Rio. Pull up a chair, because I'll be there stuffing my face."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night. They were closing in 30 mins. Guy was cleaning the counter with a rag and bucket. Other workers were cleaning. Guy cleaning the counter came and took my order. Started making my burrito without washing his hands or changing gloves. When asked to change gloves he went to the back and other worker took over my order. I then told her what happened and she continued making my food without even listening. I ended up leaving."}
{"text":"The sweet pork is really good. They are open till 10pm on during the week which is awesome! I also really like the quesadillas, black beans and rice. The employees are hit and miss in terms of niceness. The drink selection is huge!"}
{"text":"very tasty ... tasted gourmetish ( make up words) ... for only 9$ it kept me fed for lunch as well as dinner"}
{"text":"What's the point of having an online ordering system if you are just going to make it when I walk in the door?  I could have gone through the line and gotten it faster! Especially since you weren't even that busy! The worst part was, when I said something to the \"manager\" ( I don't think there was even one there) she didn't even apologize for the wait.   Bottom line is, don't ever bother ordering ahead it's not worth your time and they certainly don't care either way!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the service, but the food always makes my stomach sick.   Bathrooms are always dirty. Last time i was there, I left the place \"running\"."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is always delish.  This is a new one so obviously there are always growing pains, never the less, after a little longer wait than at other locations the food was fabulous.  They also were giving samples of deserts which I hadn't tried before.  Dang now I'm hooked to something else there."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is just not what it used to be.  I have always really liked Cafe Rio but is it just me or have they become increasingly stingy with their meat?  I love their sweet pork!  But when I order a sweet pork burrito and have to dig through rice and beans to find the few shreds of pork, I'm disappointed.  Tonight was probably the last trip I'll make out to Cafe Rio.  Bummer, it used to hold a special place in my heart.  RIP Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Wow. It's really all I can say. I don't understand how one single cafe rio of the multiple around can run so poorly. I had high hopes for the second chance, but I'd rather drive 25 minutes to the eastern location. Being the only customer in line, that's how long it took for my steak salad to be made and rung up. The steak was cold, the tortilla was hard, and I stood at the topping section for ten minutes waiting for someone to ask what I wanted on top. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"The food is great love the place, BUT ordering for a catered lunch has always been a disaster. We always fax the orders in ahead of time, now the orders are done online (days in advance) and they never have the lunch ready for pickup when we request.  We ordered a lunch with 20 items to be ready at 11:30 for a noon lunch and when we showed up, they haven't even started working on it!! So after 10 min of confusion and searching we waited about 20min.  Having lunch 30 min late for a business meeting does not make anyone look good."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just to comment on my horrific experience with this location. Cafe Rio is sometimes my go-to after I hit the gym, but not any more.   I came to have a quick dinner on 10/15/17. It took about 20 minutes just to order. There was only me and someone else in the line but for some reason there was a big delay. When I finally got to the register I realized it was one employee that was delaying everything - her name ended up being Esmeralda.   I realized there were no napkins so I asked Esmeralda at the register if we can have some and she said \"sure, I'll get you some right now\". I sat down and watched her as she didn't go for more napkins, but instead went to mess with other employees and right after blatantly got on her phone and was there fiddling with her phone for at least 5 minutes. After about 10 minutes I decided to get up and I asked another employee and we got the napkins right away.   As I'm wrapping up my dinner I heard a commotion coming from the cash register and it was another employee spilling a platter of I don't know what in between her legs, making it look like she was peeing. Both girls (Esmeralda being the main one) were laughing so obnoxiously loud that it made sitting there another second unbearable.   Finally I am throwing away my trash to get out of this nightmare of a dining experience and as I'm walking out Esmeralda and one of her gentlemen co-workers set their food down at a table and race past me through the doors. As I drove away It looked as though both of them were taking part in illegal activity (smoking).   There was a bigger gentlemen that worked there with a wrist tattoo that was awesome and even though he was stuck working with children that have a blatant disregard for professionalism and customer service, he handled himself well and tended to each customer that walked in. Poor guy was doing a bit of a juggling act trying to make up for his coworkers that were playing around.   All in all it was horrendous. Me and my many friends eat at Cafe Rio frequently but this experience left a nasty taste in my mouth and needless to say none of us will be eating at Cafe Rio again. It is clearly mis managed and should review not only process of employment, but also, drug policies, as well as their employee training program."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is in a great location for lunch and they tend to move people through the line fairly quickly. I was most impressed on my last visit. Despite a manager and two employees having just walked out, the people at the counter were working diligently to make us all happy.  Here's my otherwise typical Cafe Rio review (also fitting for this location):  I love Café Rio! It is my usual haunt because there are so few restaurants that offer healthy fast food. All their ingredients are fresh and made immediately right before your eyes.   I always get the salad with just beans (no rice), lettuce, pico de gallo, and creamy cilantro dressing. I have them put the 440 calorie tortilla on the side (so I can make quesadilla quarters for a snack or dinner side dish later in the week) making the total salad calorie count less than 400 calories. I can often get 2 meals out of the salad. Don't be afraid to ask for more of each ingredient. I ask for them to put in 2 scoops of black beans (I'm mostly vegetarian) and as much lettuce and pico as they can fit. They always generously oblige. Even after a long workout (I'm a long course triathlete so a 75 mile ride or half marathon training session aren't uncommon), the salad is filling. There is nowhere else I've found a salad that completely fills me (though Cheesecake Factory comes close).   There are several perks for regulars. Download their app and scan it at the register to earn $10 off every $100 spent. They also announce special offers on the app--like double-point days. Another perk relates to the receipt. Most receipts ask if you'd like to complete an online survey. The survey takes about 5 minutes. Once done, you receive a numerical code allowing you to get free chips and salsa or a free dessert. You do not have to combine these freebies with an order. Sometimes, I stop by my neighborhood Cafe Rio just to pick up a snack of free chips."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito. Pretty big portion of food for a good price. Very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Basic, bland cafeteria fare.  I had the beef burrito. Found the beef to be flavorless. The big tortilla was nice. There were no authentic flavors/spices jumping out.    Its not surprising alot of people on here like the place, the food is bland and predictable, it is very Americanized Mexican food.  For a chain Mex restaurant, Chipolte beats this place."}
{"text":"The food was what it is, more on the sweeter side than spicey. I had the Pork burrito with all the fixens. What put is over the top was the customer service. The gentleman by the name of Edgar went above and beyond with his knowledge of preference. My first visit and I was confused but, Edgar was very patient explaining the process and what would compliment my taste buds. Edgar really knew the menu, His suggestion was on point."}
{"text":"Absolutely great I ended up going there for breakfast and then lunch the next day. It is absolutely one of the best Mexican food places I've ever been to. It's basically a fresh local chipotle, with a few more options."}
{"text":"Hey well I called in my order and they didn't start it until everyone in line was taken care of once I got there. What's the point again of calling ahead!??"}
{"text":"Love this place but the management is horrible mistreating their employees and no customer service skills. I haven't seen the awesome guy that was running register before he was awesome. If anyone else has had a bad experience at this location write your review helpfully that chain will improve their management and customer service."}
{"text":"Great food, poor front line management. Second time we have been here and the cashier (same both times, very tall) is incredibly slow. The food is excellent and prepared to perfection by everyone else! However food took twice as long because of the incompetency of the cashier!!!  Should be five star but the cashier ruined it!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken quesadilla and it had a bone in the chicken still. Are you freaking kidding me?! It's a good thing my child wasn't eating this quesadilla and choked on the bone. So ridiculous."}
{"text":"I love burritos and this place always has fresh, great tasting food. I usually get the barbacoa and it's amazing. Great inside and friendly service. Only problem is that the parking lot tends to fill up very quickly and the lines can be a little long."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican fast food. Always fresh and tasty. I substitute corn for the flour tortilla to avoid gluten. Their horchata is good too, but if you get there late you may miss it. They give military discount too!"}
{"text":"I normally like this chain and come here semi frequently. This is the first time I was at this location and I was very disappointed. First with a gluten allergy I wanted the enchiladas with corn tortillas but they we're out of the corn tortillas.  Prior to my ordering the server brought out some fresh rice to the steam table. When she took out the old tray from the steam table she put it on top of the fresh flour tortillas not realizing that she got it all wet from the bottom of the pan that came out of the steam table thereby contaminating the tortillas. I mentioned something but they didn't care or didn't notice and just left it there for the next person."}
{"text":"I got good for my fiancé here. He didn't know I was going there. I guess he's eaten there before in Salt Lake. He said this was waaaay better! Fresher than he's had before. He said what he had before was greasy and this was real clean. He had 3 tacos. Beef, chicken, pork.. the best was the Beef. I had food from somewhere else already but I will try their wet veggie burrito next time. It looked amazing. Btw.. they were very quick. Food was ready immediately. No excuse for other so called \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Every single time I order from here they ALWAYS forget to give me the extra sides.  When ordering online...  Also when ordering on line you get to put in a time when you want to pick up your order.  It's never even started when I go there to pick it up.  Plus the customer service they provide is horrible.  They always seem frazzled and just very unorganized."}
{"text":"This was just about my worst experience I've ever had at a café Rio. The staff was extremely unfriendly and clearly did not know how to make a meal. I ordered two salads both with sweet pork and the girl putting the salads together gave me just about the worlds smallest portion I had to ask her if she was kidding. Like I get food costs but the amount she gave me wasn't even worth paying for I'll need dinner again after this. So when I made a comment she took another small bites worth and threw it on top and goes, \" better?\" Now the guy right behind me in line had asked for extra meat on his plate and I heard him make a remark whether or not she was going to give him extra meat. Which she gave him one more bites worth to. His double portion was still lesss then I've ever received as a single portion at any other location. When the girl finishing my salad put the guacamole on top, the guacamole was almost out so she scooped what was barely left and split it between my two salads. I then proceeded to ask her if she was going to give me the rest of the portion to which she said no she gave me enough. If wasn't even maybe a half of scoop. I did however want sour cream and no dressing. Every other location will substitute the two for one another where they processed to charge me for both when I still didn't even receive a full portion of sour cream. Extremely disappointed and I hardly ever leave a bad review. Either these kids working need more training or management is being really stingy on their food costs. I've never been so annoyed to pay for something so awful."}
{"text":"I've been to this location numerous times just because it's so convenient, but I don't plan on returning. The quality at this location is awful. We ordered chips and queso and the chips were terribly stale. When we asked for new chips, the employee turned to her colleague and asked for new chips to be made as \"the chips have been stale all day.\" Not too sure if she knew we heard her, but if you knew the chips were stale, why would you knowingly continue to serve them to your patrons!?! I can only assume they could care less about the quality of their product and their employees take zero pride in their workplace. Such a shame. This location is an embarrassment. I'll be driving farther from now on to go to a Cafe Rio that cares about who and what they serve."}
{"text":"Love this location and love Café Rio!  While during peak times the lines can be long, I've never had an issue with customer service and the line still runs smoothly.  I've ordered online for pick up on several occasions from this office with them always being accurate and no issues. Thank goodness I don't live too far away from this location, but the location that I work near is absolutely horrendous.  Thanks for being amazing Café Rio off Stephanie St!  I wish you could train the Blue Diamond staff!!"}
{"text":"I've had better mexican food than this. Tried this place out today b/c my co-worker suggested it, and i was a bit disappointed. It was not busy, yet I felt rushed and confused as to why the lettuce and salsa was on the side instead of in the burrito. On top of that they charge extra for sour cream. I honestly felt the food wasn't that great at all. Chipotle taste way better. Even Roberto's is better food. This is like fake Mexican food. Maybe it was the location? but we will not be coming back to have dinner at  this place again."}
{"text":"It seems like all the bad reviews about this place are about the service and are very deserving. It always seems VERY disorganized, nobody seems to care and everything about the the layout is confusing. Food is decent but EVERYTHING else falls short, if you choose anywhere else to eat in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Placed an online order at 5:30 to be picked up at 6pm. Arrived at 5:55 and paid. Was told food was not yet ready. After 45 minutes of waiting, and being reassured that \"they were working on it,\" I came to find that my order was not even in the system (yet my receipt showed the order name and matched the email confirmation). Somehow it was cleared. After 55 minutes, my pick up was ready. When I asked the pick up cashier why he told me for 45 minutes that my order was coming, he responded, \"it's our dinner rush and we make our food fresh.\" I'm sorry, what?!?  Will be a cold day before I order here again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! However what i find is that this location gets a little dirty and inconsistent food. Also the cashiers never seem to smile but i love the food so much that I will always continue to go. Lines can be long but you get value for the price and good food."}
{"text":"Great place for some tacos. Definitely get the pulled pork. Was so flavorful and great. I honestly think about it a lot. I got just a single taco which came with rice and chips and I felt so full afterwards. Really worth the price you pay.  They have some pretty big portions, so would definitely recommend splitting or saving some food for later."}
{"text":"Place is consistent at being just awful! You would think free lunch at work and id be a happy camper but they always get the order wrong and the food is either dry or hard or both.  Beans and rice were dry as dirt and the nachos had little to no cheese. Food just rolls around the mouth looking for moisture. Id choke on the beans if i didnt have a water bottle at the ready. On this run I ordered a steak enchiladas with corn tortillas and got chicken on flour tortillas. What the hell!! Next time ill just tell them to surprise me! Why bother ordering if the whole order is wrong. Their green chili also has a gelatinous texture which causes concern.   I hate when work brings up cafe rio and would prefer the local taco shops next to this dump. Hell ill take el pollo loco or robertos next to this."}
{"text":"Everyone hypes this place so much! Go to get my fiancé and I some lunch, get there right before 12. Figured it would be busy for lunch time. Ordering a pretty simple meal, two chicken quesadillas and one just cheese.... the meal comes to a total of $29. Okay, let's just take a moment.... you're not selling gold plated quesadillas, and you damn well are not getting your money's worth for how small and ridiculous the portion they give you is! I pay it because we're starving. Get in my car look at the time it's now 12:30. So I spend thirty minutes waiting in a line, when my food took all of two minutes to prepare.  Best part, get home finally get to eat! Only to find a hair in my quesadilla, you know the ones I just spent $29 on?! I'm not too sure how your employees get away with no hair nets and working over open food all day, but considering your prices are ridiculous... at least up your service! Completely disgusted! Thanks.... for nothing!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. The service has been ok but today takes the cake. Found a hair in my chicken in my burrito. So nasty! Didn't realize it was in there until I had the bite IN MY MOUTH!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, it's great food and way better than Chipotle or other competitors. However, this location has hired some rude staff. They also apparently hate their online ordering system which I like using because I hate waiting in line. Both times i've ordered from this location online the staff member was rude, treated me horrible and made me not want to come back. The first time I ordered online I had a \"Free Drink\" and I asked her for my cup and she said \"you didn't order one, I then said yes I did it says it on my receipt\" and she replied \"oh yeah you do get one for free if you order online here\" and gave me a nasty smirk while handing over the cup. Which to me was like why do you care if I paid for it or not you'll still get paid either way.  But who knows maybe she is one of those \"I should get $15 an hour for working in a fast food joint\" employees. The next time I ordered online I was sick, all I wanted was tortilla soup and it's not like Cafe Rio delivers. So I ordered my soup and showed up at the scheduled time and I walked through the Empty line because people at tables were blocking the walkway to the to-go walkway and the employee then yells at me \"ma'am aren't you going to order first\" I explain to her that I'm here to pick up an order from online I just couldn't get through the other way and she looks at me like I'm crazy. She then opens the online ordering system and realizes no one paid attention that they had an order online to fulfill. She tells me it will be a few minutes and 10 minutes later of me standing there like an idiot in my PJ's sick and wanting to go back to bed, my small little cup of soup was ready to go. Luckily I paid by credit card online so I didn't have to pay so she just handed me the bag with a \"fuck off\" smile and didn't even wish me to have a good day. I wrote a letter to the corporate office and they apologized heard me out and sent me two free meal cards. I'm not sure if I should come back and use them at this location but I feel like I should that way they know that they are terrible and need to improve their customer service skills."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's all locations but the West Sahara location has an issue with their phones. It's been an issue for months. I tried calling the number that is listed and it first went to an automatic Cafe Rio message then went silent...then I tried to call again at least five times and it went to a Sprint error message. I proceeded to order online but the soonest the order could even be recognized by the system was 45 minutes later. If I could have just talked to someone that would have saved us so much time. Such a waste of time. We've always loved Cafe Rio but this system is a total pain. Sorry but you're losing customers because of this."}
{"text":"Not a big menu, food is very good with big portions.   I ordered there salad with chicken and shredded pork combo it was amazing.  Will come back again, staff was great management was on point."}
{"text":"Look on the receipt that I uploaded!!  $15 for a steak burrito with guacamole and a drink???????!!!! I can seat in a nice Mexican restaurant  eat and they will serve me for $15 come on!!!! My last time here!!"}
{"text":"Nice place because it's new and also they serve salmon - but yesterday I ordered shredded chicken in my burrito and I BITE INTO A HUGE BONE!!! You can see the  attached -if a 5 years old was biting into this bone or swallow that it's was ending totally different!!!! I'll take from here and contact who ever needs to be contact!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff has consistently been friendly and helpful. I love the salads with either pork or grilled chicken (I'm not a fan of the shredded chicken, it's worth paying a bit more for the grilled) and the creamy tomatillo dressing is fantastic. I also enjoy the burritos (enchilada style) and the desserts are delicious as well."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because today I was helped by a worker named Destiny and her customer service blew we away for a Cafe Rio employee!! She went the extra mile with asking me what I wanted on my burrito and being specific about the cheese, you can just tell she cared. I've been to this location a few times & I've never had someone take care of me like Destiny has. It surprised me so much I had to write a review. Thank you destiny !"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Vegas over the weekend and some friends took us to Cafe Rio for lunch on Monday.  Walking in I thought it was sort of Chipotle-esq and  was wondering why it was so packed.  Now I know!    I had the sweet pork barbacoa burrito \"enchilada style\".   I am still daydreaming about it days later.  I wouldn't shed a tear if all the Chipotles and Qdobas here where I live, in Colorado Springs, closed down and were replaced by Cafe Rio.  That burrito was unbelieveable.  Perfectly savory, seasoned, spicy, sweet, and moist pork.  The rice and beans, and the green chili sauce on top weren't a distraction from the barbacoa but were just right.    Damn.  Why am I writing this review?  I'm just making myself hungry thinking about Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Best fast food besides in n out! Love this place! Ask for the house sauce and the limeade!"}
{"text":"Good food for a fair price. They make the specialty drinks and tortillas from scratch. The limeade is amazing! Also a big fan of the hot sauce selections. House salad dressing is also very good!"}
{"text":"My main complaint is for the Eastern location & their dishonesty & worthless customer service. 2/21/15 Ordered food for pick up, hubby brought food home but they forgot the guacamole & chips ($4.99). It was less than 30 mins before I called and spoke to Ramiro the cashier, who also was the one who bagged our food (per hubby) and told him they forgot the Guac/chips. He stated they will credit it back to our credit card. Ok, so I wait, and of course I forgot and today I remembered. Of course it's a lousy $5.40 but it's the principle of it that pissed me off because it's now 2 weeks later and I still haven't gotten any credit in my bank. If you want to keep customers coming then honesty and good service is all you need. So I call and I got Ramiro right away, informed him we never recv'd our credit and he quickly says \"hold on\", after a minute he comes back on the phone and says my manager said you need to come in for the credit. So I said No, I need to speak w/your manager. Mike, the manager, gets on the phone and I'm telling him about the situation and he keeps talking over me & then says that $5.40 is not a big deal!! Might not be for him but it might be for others. Doesn't matter how much the amount you don't tell people it's not a big deal! No apology or anything just made it seem like I was making a big DEAL out of it. Anyways he ended up saying they can't credit our card after 24hrs and kept repeating he doesn't know anything about the situation! well youre the damn manager doesn't matter, you find a way to fix the situation. Throughout the whole convo he's being sarcastic and condescending with his statements. Then he says what do I want to do, I told him you tell me, it's not my fault you didn't credit me back. He gave me a choice to pick up reimbursement or we had to get reimbursed thru the corporate office. Told him we will come in to pick it up in the store. Anyways NEVER again will I eat there because service alone was terrible!!! Horrible way to treat customers!"}
{"text":"I ordered a taco and a quesadilla. Both had BARELY a SPRINKLE OF CHEESE. So I asked for cheese twice when I got to the end of the line. They have me a tiny SPRINKLE both times! The quesadilla had so little cheese there were gaps between the cheese big enough for the end of my finger!!!! I couldn't help but notice OTHER PEOPLE WERE GETTING MORE CHEESE! There was almost no cheese on my taco at the end of all of that stupidity! My husband used to go here twice a week and ALWAYS got a normal amount of cheese! He always got over twice what I got! This is a SHITTY, SHADY and GHETTO poorly run business.  On a different night I walked in to use the bathroom bc Starbucks that I was hanging out in front of closed. They started yelling at me that they were closed after I was halfway through the store. The door was unlocked and it was only 9:15!!! RUDE beyond belief! The people working here have no concept of customer service and treat me husband differently than me on any occasion were separated.  This place is full of RUDE TOXIC PIGS!  I'm never going back after today. That is the last straw!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They can't even pack a bag of food correctly. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly employees. I definitely recommend.   The salads here are to die for."}
{"text":"My family just moved here from Denver and have always enjoyed Cafe Rio.  Our only complaint with the chain has always been the rush the employees seem to be in.  They need to understand the difference between fast service and rushed service.  They seem to be preparing our food as if they know how we want it.  When we stray from the norm, it usually ends up in an incorrect order and some sort of attitude.  Until now the quality of the food outweighed the poor service.  The Gilbert location is out of control!  The poor attitude and lack of customer service and language barrier has changed our outlook on cafe rio.  Chipotle here we come!"}
{"text":"I'm in the customer service industry and am appalled at the service provided by Café Rio, specifically the Blue Diamond location 3 times in a row now.  3 week ago we placed an online order for my entire office (15 orders).  We placed the order over 1.5 hours prior to scheduled pick up.  There is no warning, nor notice online stating times may vary so we showed up about 10 minutes late and told the order still isn't ready.  Our employee that picked it up, on the payroll clock, had to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready.  Luckily the did provide a 25% discount on our order.  By the time it got to the our office, 1 meal was missing and 2 were made incorrectly, so we had to send someone back (10 minute drive each way)...slightly ridiculous...but we get mistakes happen.  Our office ws upset by the situation above, but still love Café Rio and food so much we tried again.  My coworker ordered a single Chicken Salad yesterday online and showed up and it was ready on time.  She brought it back, it was completely wrong and no meat in her salad.  At this point, lunch is about over so we can't come back to pick it up.  TODAY .. I order 2 salads online for pick up at 1pm.  I show up at 1:15 and am told it's still another 15-20 minute wait.  I told them to cancel it and left.  After I left I called to speak with a manager (Friday 9/25/15 around 1:30pm) and was told there isn't a manager on duty to speak to me on the phone and then told she isn't accepting calls right now.  I get that it's a lunch rush, however, I'm an angry and upset customer and the manager should be available.  At this point, 3 times in a row, the meal wasn't ready within a 15 minute time frame with no warning and our orders continually get messed up.  The staff members making the take-out orders need to be more thorough and just pay attention to the orders.  It's not a difficult job and to follow directions.  One time I understand, but when it continually happens it becomes unacceptable.  I will no longer bring our business to the Blue Diamond location and notice I'm not the first one with terrible reviews on Yelp either.  I think this staff and management needs to have another few training sessions."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love Cafe Rio but today's visit was so bad :( we got there and there were literally 9 employees no exaggeration. Some of the staff was standing and others were stocking. Ok we get that...but when a customer comes in you stop stocking and help them. The girl that helped us was so rude but I felt like she was mad cause she was the only one doing everything (still not a reason to be mad at us). Then our food sat there for like 3 minutes until I asked the kid stocking if someone was going to finish our food he said \"oh yea he will in a bit\"...um ok. Then we ordered chips and guacamole and the two girls were both struggling to get chips...it was seriously so irritating watching a bunch of employees and only the rude one working. Hopefully this place gets better."}
{"text":"Food is great, however this location is newly opened and seems to have some kinks to work out in the line.  My family and I come here each Tuesday after swim and it doesn't seem to matter how many customers are in line, it takes a while to get through.  What's frustrating is seeing your hot food just sit there.  Hopefully this gets figured out."}
{"text":"We love Cafe Rio but the service at this one isn't great. Whenever I place a to go order over the phone I try to give them plenty of time to have my order ready. No matter how long I give them my order still hasn't even been started when I arrive. The last time I had somewhere I needed to be. They charged my card and then informed me my order wasn't ready. I told them I had to be somewhere and they said there was nothing they could do. I asked if they could refund my money and the girl rolled her eyes and said she would get her manager. The manager was very nice and said my order was almost ready. When I got my order they had the wrong dressing. When I mentioned it to the girl (same one from before) she was super annoyed and wouldn't even look at me when she brought me the correct dressing. So great food but not very good service at this location."}
{"text":"UNACCEPTABLE. Let me start off that I am a HUGE cafe rio fan and have been for years since living in Utah. I was SO excited when I heard that cafe rio was coming in near my home in AZ and that I didn't have to drive to mesa to get the delicious sweet pork salad anymore!  The issue- The past 3 times I call in or order 2 of these salads online at 545pm to pick up on my way home from a very long day at work. EACH TIME I have come in 20 minutes AFTER PICKUP TIME And have waited an additional 35+ minutes for the salads. EVERY TIME.   Unless you plan on wasting nearly 2 hours of your life after an 8+hr work day... or any day WAITING for a salad youve ordered BEFORE everyone else that's waiting in line...that by the way is getting their food BEFORE YOU  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE, because then they'll still put uncooked crunchy rice in your entree. I'm appalled at the \"service\" your manager ought to be fired. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I love their fresh made tortillas. But so do lots of others, so darn disappointed that it's so popular I have to wait in line. I don't frequent chain restaurants very often, preferring locally owned businesses, but I'm glad to know that when I need some freshly prepared food, Cafe Rio is there. Bonus that they give the frequent diner card without being asked & that it is a stamp per meal, not visit even when ordering 4 meals like some restaurants."}
{"text":"Originally I came here on their opening day last year and had so many problems I didn't want to leave a review until I could come back and try them again after they've been open for some time. And today at work we were all craving Cafe Rio and decided to place an order online and with this location being the closest to us and been open for some time we figured let's do it! Even though our order was written online perfect they still messed up the entire order. For example my VA ordered two tacos with rice and beans but instead received 1 plain taco barely any chicken, no cheese, toppings or rice & beans - just a plain ol' taco? The person who picked it up for us knew we only had so much time to eat so he didn't think to check to make sure it was correct but why should he have to? I definitely won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Watched the news report on refusing to serve a police officer in uniform.  Could have been handled better than how it was.  Consumers have the power of choice and I will take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a huge cafe rio fan...have been for years.  I was so excited when they opened the location right down the street from my house a couple months ago.  I have eaten at this location so many times since they opened.  Every time has been great!  I kinda feel bad for \"complaining\" about tonight's visit---but, feel I have to say something.  I don't know if they have become relaxed, or maybe it was just an off night---which I will be back in a couple days(at most) and see.  Tonight, everything was off---the appearance of the food, the quality, and frankly just the attitude of the employees.  My burrito wasn't even wrapped---just a tortilla, stuffed with my ingredients and thrown together.  The line was so filthy it almost made me walk out---but, I really love the food, so I hoped it would taste better than it looked.  It didn't...poor customer service, poor quality of food.  Super bummed!!!  I hope that when I go back in a couple days it is better---then I can update my review and call this night a fluke!  Cafe Rio, I love you---but, please stay yummy!!!   2 stars--- because I like you guys too much to go with 1 star---but, my meal tonight was like a negative 7 stars---usually 5 stars would be an understatement.  Please get back to your 5 Star Ways!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really see the appeal of this place, especially when Chipotle is a block away.  Portions are small, flavors are lacking, and prices are like 35% higher than Chipotle.  No corn salsa is a deal-breaker."}
{"text":"do NOT order online or call for pick up! This is the 3rd time that I've placed an order in the morning for afternoon pick up and it is neveR ready on time.  20 or 30 minutes after scheduled pick up time is ridiculous (and it's like that each time!) I know it's busy but that's why I am prepared and place the order in advance so they have time to prepare and have our order ready...unfortunately they don't prioritize or organize their \"pick up\" orders. I've waited longer than customers that are just walking in to order.  I have scheduled meetings and for that reason I order online 3-4 hours ahead....well I used to, too many other choices to deal with this chaos again."}
{"text":"Came here a few times, typically after work around 7-8pm. For some odd reason, they are always backed up and behind.   During my most recent visit, even the manager is working the line helping catch up. Took a good 30-45 minutes before I got through the line. They never ran out of ingredients, just took forever for some odd reason. The tortilla lady was consistently making tortillas, which was great. Who doesn't love fresh homemade tortillas? wish I can just get a stack of it. So much better than those pre-made ones from the store.   Food wise, its fairly consistent. I usually get barbacoa (sweet pork) burrito enchilada style with red sauce. I think I've tried that new habanero hatch chili one too. I don't remember.   Hope they can figure out how to get more efficient on the line. They kind of lose track of their orders too when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly location. Had our online ordered order ready in like 15-20 minutes after ordering online. Ordered online and paid at work, drove down the street and picked it up. Surprising it was done already since it was during lunch rush too. Back and forth in less than 20 minutes. Including driving time. Win !  No missed items. Friendly staff. My barbacoa burrito enchilada style was delicious.   Busy location being on Eastern but not so bad since it was Sunday. Wonder how it would be on a weekday?"}
{"text":"I am very disgusted with Cafe Rio not only are their burritos expensive they charge you if you want it wet then they charge you for salsa how,HOW BAD IS THAT.You can go down the street to a real Mexican place and get a real burrito for much less money and with out the rice filler and a salsa bar with salsas,jalapeños and carrots,green onions and all you want.And they have real Spanish rice and beans on the side not in the burrito. I have been going to this place ever since they opened the first one in San Diego,do you know who I'm talking about??"}
{"text":"My first visit to Cafe Rio was awesome on Stephanie, Henderson! My husband and I were excited about our next visit. We decided to try out Cafe Rio on Eastern, Henderson.... AWEFUL!!!!! Are we at the same chain resturant!!! The food was sloppy. the shredded chicken soaked in oil looking juice & shredded beef taste like it was burnt or scraped from the bottom of a pot!! The staff AWEFUL!! It was a bunch of young kids running the place with no customer service experience EVER! The cashier was rude to her co-workers and worst the customers not just to my husband and I but to about 3 other customers even a to go order customer who wasn't even there.  When we left we had tons of options of places to eat to our left and to our right. One of my last days on vacation, this was a negative. Shame on Cafe Rio management they really need to get a handle on their young rude staff!!! NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT LOCATION!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Cafe Rio in Gilbert Arizona when I lived out there.  This place rocks!  LOVE their sweet pork!  Get it in Tacos, Burrito, Salad, what ever great!  LOVE their chile con queso!  They give you a ton of chips with it.  Bottled Cokes from Mexico!!  This location was right across from UNLV so there are a ton of college students there which gave it a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Made meal wrong and said they'd have to charge me for another one. After this I'll probably just go to chipotle which is just a little down the road."}
{"text":"I have been to a few other locations, this location is one of my favorites along with the eastern location in Silverado Ranch. People are always friendly and know what they are doing. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is one of the regular spots for lunch or dinner, food is pretty consistent and service is on par. They could use a little help in the front of house making sure tables are cleaned floors maintained during evening hours."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  The chicken and steak are both good, but you have to get the pork barbacoa...its the best!  Sweet taste to it and its undescribable...you'll thank me later!!! :) All the meat can be either in a salad, burrito, or taco entree.  Like I said, you can't go wrong with either of those and the hand made tortilla's just make it that much better! Great place to eat, I'm a big fan...every city I travel to I try to find a cafe rio.  Finish your meal off with the coconut flan...to die for! Enjoy because I know I am!"}
{"text":"I usually love Cafe Rio but this location is a disaster. The people who work there are unfriendly and rude!  If you ask for any type of alteration in the order you are met with terrible attitude from the staff.  The food is the worst I've had at any Cafe Rio location. Management doesn't seem to care as this location has been this way since it opened and has only gotten worse.  I'm sorry Cafe Rio but I will no longer be patronizing this location. Attitude, wet lettuce and a salad that could pass for soup for the price of $9 is just a little steep for my taste."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS A LOT OF HELP!!!!  Customer service is a nightmare and Managers need to focus on there performance. I am not a complainer but when your online orders consistanly are wrong and when told to call an order in from now on and then they constatnly hang up on you then you are forced to find another place to eat.   Food is great but they have to seriously work on customer service!!   Cafe Rio has lost our loyalty!"}
{"text":"1st time here and my sister recommended the salad with their sweet pork barbacoa. She also insisted on getting their \"house\" dressing. The slight saltiness of the cheese, with the ranch-like flavor of their \"house\" dressing along with the sweet bbq sauce of the barbacoa were a powerful group of flavors that are worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love salad, and they make a whopper of a salad. The burritos are crazy huge, too! They make home made tortillas, as well. Not too much else to say. Good job, Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"This is a nice alternative to Chipotle. Fresh ingredients and the expansive drink selection includes Strawberry Lemonade, Mint Limeade, Horchata, and three varieties of ice tea with a line of flavored simple syrups you can pump in. This drink bar is one of the reasons I will come back; it offers unsweetened passion fruit iced tea (china mist brand) which is difficult to find beyond Panda Express. I love it!  Hubby had the burrito. It is standard practice for them to put the lettuce and pico on the side, which means he made a mess opening it up to put it into the burrito afterwards. I shouted my order on my tip-toes since the sneeze guard is really tall (hate that). I had salmon tacos - correction, salmon TACO. I was nervous because I ordered a SINGLE taco with a side of rice and beans, but it was plenty to fill me. The 4 or 5 ingredient dish was deliciously simple.   The patio outside needed some minor TLC to clean up the bird poop and paint the scraped railings, but indoors was very clean - with exception to the bathrooms. Pretty disappointed with dirtiness of the restroom at 11:30am on a Sunday, so eat at Café Rio, but use Grimaldi's bathroom next door!"}
{"text":"I go to Cafe Rio on a regular basis (atleast once a week). Their Pork Salad and Tortilla Soup are great!  Their daily specials are also something to consider because those meals come with a drink. Personally I prefer Thursdays for their tamales.   Cafe Rio also has a stamp card (if you don't have one, ask the cashier for one) which for every entree you order you earn a stamp and after ten stamps you earn a free meal (plus drink).  Cafe Rio is definitely worth looking into; and if you're a burrito fan, enchilada style is a must!"}
{"text":"Food food is good time little load ini side dining room I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I refuse to write long reviews on chain restaurants so I'll just give you the skinny.  - Tortillas are freshly made right there in the store and have the perfect warm chew!  - Salsa will cost you extra but they do offer plenty of hot sauces for free.  - Burritos are huge, heck everything is huge even the salad.  - Don't upgrade to the grilled chicken as the standard meats taste just as good.  - Prices are a little stepper than Chipotle.  - Awesome drink bar! Unlimited refills on Auga Frescas! Plus flavor shot options so you can customize your drink."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  I am very disappointed because I have eaten here often without issue until this evening.  Who sells Mexican food and doesn't have any salsa?  No pico de gallo or fresca.  It was 8:50p and they don't close until 11p.  Also, they didn't mention that until you got to the end of the line and they said - we have no salsa, either one.  What?  I asked how long until they did?  Guy said, IDK.  He was rude and tired and didn't offer any discount or    anything.  I asked for an extra punch and he said NO.  I was buying 4 meals with NO salsa available.  I asked to speak to the manager and she said, \"we were busy\" and then walked away.  Extremely rude customer service! they knew it and didn't care!"}
{"text":"First we time we tried it we felll in love.  Been back a couple of more time just as good as the first.  Definitely on a our go to list"}
{"text":"If you love taking chances I highly suggest going to this café Rio! Half the time you don't know whether or not you're going to get what you ordered! It's a pretty fun game if I must say so myself."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was so excited when they finally put one close by. The pork salad is so so yummy! The service has gotten better since they first opened. The food is fresh and today the staff was very friendly! I suggest anything on the menu. Don't forget the mint lemonade...."}
{"text":"food good,but employees never listen to what you want, we always have our order wrong, and when you complain, manager is rude. We will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"First discovered Cafe Rio when it was served as a catered lunch at a work training seminar. After I built and and ate my steak taco, I asked where this delicious food was from...it was from the location on Eastern, I later told my wife, \"we must go to there!\".  So glad they opened the location on Stephanie, now I only need to travel down the street to get my fix. Cafe Rio is kinda like In n' Out, there is always a line and it's always busy. Simple menu, fresh ingredients, and hand made tortillas from scratch...that alone should make you wanna go there, for me it's all about the tortillas. And they make them right in front of you...  My favorite is definitely the Pork Barbacoa burrito...sweet porky goodness, rice , black beans, queso fresco and pico wrapped in a fresh, warm tortilla. Muy Bueno! Get it enchilada style, you won't regret it (you might not finish it, but you won't regret it). My second choice would have to be the Fire-grilled Steak, very tender and juicy...get some chips, guac and the mint Limeade, and you're set (unless you decide to go to Yogurt-land next door after all that...,yum).  So, Cafe Rio is fabuloso! The food is delicioso!...okay, I'll stop . Try it, Chipotle's not the only game in town."}
{"text":"There's only one reason I truly love Cafe Rio, it's their most amazing - Salad with meat Sweet Barbacoa paired with creamy tomatillo dressing. There's nothing like freshly cooked flour tortilla, fresh crisp greens, and all the fixings that comes with it!  The Sweet Pork Barbacoa is perfectly balanced with sweetness and spices. The generous amount of meat on the salad is well portioned. I always omit beans and rice, but request for more greens is surely an accommodation that's greatly appreciated!  The service at the Centennial location is always a plus for me. The staff works hard to speed up the line and I always get my order right. The price I pay for my salad (no extras) under $9 with free refill on drinks, is surely a bargain  for me!  And their weekly specials is another added bonus!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service tonight from the crew at Cafe Rio.... Got way to much food but the pork is so nice had nachos and wife had a salad . Very pleasant very nice experience"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican food!  Fresh, handmade tortillas, super fresh salad and ingredients.  The house dressing is the BEST!  Our favorite meal is the veggie salad with house dressing.  It's like a salad and a burrito in one meal.  So huge and filling.   We take our 3 year old with us and they always add a kid's quesadilla for free. Cafe Rio always has great service and the restaurant is always clean.  Please come to Northern California!"}
{"text":"So I came here once a week, but now I will never touch this location again.  I waited over 20 minutes for MILD SAUCE! What made it worse was I was asked 6 TIMES what sauce I would like. No, I'm just standing here watch you cook for 20 minutes. Like really?!  And gotta point out, the entire staff at this location look like they been sneaking food. It's not enjoyable as a customer watch a cashier sweat from pressing buttons."}
{"text":"I just have to say that this location always exceeds my expectations. I also have to add that I am very glad to have this location in our area of town as it's worth the few extra minutes out of my way if it means avoiding the customer service abuse from the N. Decatur/215 location.  Last week was my most recent visit. I was completely wow'd. So I'm making my way home and decide I don't feel like cooking so I call up this location and place a phone order with 3 meals. Two problems though...  I just picked up my furchild from Camp Bow Wow, and it's sweltering hot outside. How am I going to go inside and pick up this food? Surely I am not aloud to bring her inside with me and surely I would never leave her in the car under the weather conditions. I sat in the parking lot contemplating  should I take her home and come all the way back or do I see if I can seek out a good citizen to watch my pup for a few min while I run inside and pay? NO! I can't do any of those things, am I crazy? No I'm not, just hungry.   While sitting in the parking lot with my pup, I place a call to the restaurant. A super nice girl answers the phone, and I really wish I remembered her name so I could Shout her out! I explained my situation and ask if there is any way they can bring my food to the car? She said YES without hesitation. She even acknowledged my pup and said hello to her when she came out to the car.   So to end this long story I was super stoked that this location just continues to be so awesome and provided above and beyond service to me and my pup. PLUS...my order was RIGHT!!! SCORE!  Add on from a previous visit on different date: I order all our food, get to the counter to pay, and realize my wallet is missing. It's dinner time rush. So embarrassed and with people waiting behind me, I ask the cashier if there  is anyway I can call my bf and get his cc # to pay over the phone. She says sure no problem (I think she could see my embarrassment and worried look). How awesome was that? They totally could have turned me away. Again with the above and beyond! :)"}
{"text":"Okay, they even get orders wrong as a walk in. I specifically asked for grilled chicken enchi's and she puts shredded chicken in them! Really? Next to that, customer service...horrible. Everyone in there looks so down and out, just slumming away; no smiles, speak to you very emotionless. One girl even says to a man that walks up to the counter \"ya what do you need?\". Where is management at this place? I thought about asking to speak with a manager but seeing as how the employees are mummily (ya I made that word up) serving guests, I couldn't help but think that they are a reflection of how their management is allowing them to act, so it probably wouldn't be worth it. Such a shame the staffs personality and service doesn't match their delicious food."}
{"text":"I was only the 5-10th person in the door when opened and many tables had yesterday's food debris on them. Had to finally sit at one that had crumbs all over.  Then I realized that isn't art on this table surface, it's grimy filth!!! So disgusting you don't want to touch it!!! Weeks worth of filth never cleaned off tables! Where is the health department? Kept everything including phone on the black tray. Can't wait to go home and shower after being around such a disgusting filthy dining area."}
{"text":"Let's just say that if you have a choice between Chipotle and this place, you're crazy if you go to Chipotle.  I had the steak burrito, enchilada style (wet with cheese baked on.  LOTS of cheese).  Delicious at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Trash cans are always full 24/7. Food is alright. Is would much rather have chipotle though. Will stop if I have no other options."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burrito. Yummy! Counter service excellent and friendly. Coming back for more."}
{"text":"I was at the shopping plaza and I stopped by this location for the first time about a month ago. Well since then I have become addicted! I am always on the go and it is easy to stop by there and grab a salad with all fresh ingredients! I typically order the traditional steak salad or the steak tostada salad with the lime vinaigrette dressing. My guy prefers the steak burrito. Every time we have visited this location it has ended in a good experience. Bruce is my favorite and makes the visit worth my while! Now there may be a line due to the food being so delicious but they do their best to move everyone along in an orderly fashion. You can also order online to have them prepare it before your arrival. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Food quality has become horrible at this location. I used to come here all the time and the lines are always long. But in the past few months the food prep has become very suspect.   Paying 11 dollars for a salad that has bad lettuce, inedible pieces of vegetable, and the past 2 times an unidentifiable piece of hardness that breaks your teeth.   Will never come to this location again.   Lameness"}
{"text":"The food is great. Customer service is awful. All my orders have been placed on line. There has always been missing parts to each order. No beans and rice with tacos, no guacamole, no sour cream after ordering extra of both. No desserts put in. I am sorry to say, but I won't be back. There are too many other places to choose good food"}
{"text":"I love comin to cafe rio. Their portions are huge and I usually get the chicken tostada.   You could literally get anything from their menu and share with someone. I absolutely LOVE their tortilla here. They make them in house and they are always fresh.   I always order it on the side and I recommend you get it on the side when you order the salad (cause it comes with a tortilla below all the lettuce and it tends to get soggy)"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has been a favorite spot of mine for a long while now. It's a step above Chipotle in my book and they have daily specials (not sure about the weekends) that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu. The only downfall with this place is that if you're not careful when you're ordering you can end up dropping around 13 dollars for lunch. So yeah, don't go overboard ordering sides and whatnot, the portions are all pretty damn big."}
{"text":"I loved the Cafe Rio in Henderson so I was taken back that this locations quality and taste was so different from my experience at the other location. The restaurant is very clean looking but in my opinion the workers don't move very quickly.  I haven't witnessed the best food safety practices either and that's probably why I ended up with a stomach illness from eating here with someone else. We both ended up very sick and it had to be from either the lettuce or the sour cream. I won't go back."}
{"text":"My husband seriously loves this place (I'm more of Chipotle fan). The food is good and prepared fairly quickly. The burritos are good and the salads are good (both dressings are amazing). My 2-year old gets a free quesadilla when we eat here which is cool.   I did take off a star because, IMO, the price is way too high. We can't seem to come here without spending $30+. (The salad is more expensive than the burrito or the tacos or pretty much anything else on the menu...which is crazy. Really? It's lettuce. Costco sells it in bulk for less than $2.)  That's the only thing that keeps my husband from eating here weekly. Otherwise, pretty good for fast food."}
{"text":"They literally messed up our entire order. We ordered a burrito, a quesadilla and 2 tostadas without the tortilla, cilantro, beans or rice. One of the tostadas came with with the tortilla and 1/4 of the veggies it was supposed to have. The other one came with tortilla strips on top and extra cilantro. The burrito came very poorly wrapped and was falling apart. The quesadilla was fine but the quac that came with it was brown.   The customer service was fine and the meat tasted good. They were friendly, but that is not enough to make me go back there again."}
{"text":"Damn it ever time I order online they fuck up my order. I don't know if anyone experiences this but it's getting really frustrating. Don't get me wrong they got good food. I wish this could get addressed.  Maybe it's just my luck or bad luck in this case."}
{"text":"Very bad service here.  I usually don't bother with Yelp but it took my wife about 10 minutes to get cheese quesadilla after we were already seated and had paid. When she got it they tried giving it to some other person.  Gets one star because food was good.  Hire some competent people, 20 minutes to make a salad and a cheese quesadilla, c'mon.  It also was not packed in here."}
{"text":"I like the food here, and I love the house green ranch dressing (not sure if exact name).   BUT-  the wait and the lines are terrible.  Not in a \"wow it's so busy\" but a \"wow, they are slow\"  I keep coming back because I like the tostadas with the green ranch.  I would go a lot more if the wait wasn't ridiculous.   Oh and NEVER do the preorder, never.   Both times I waited an hour after my pick up time. I would have left or gone through the regular line, but the preorder is prepaid."}
{"text":"I love that you can watch them make the tortillas. The grilled chicken tostada is always good. One of the best parts is the drink bar. The sugar free strawberry lemonade is one of the best things ever."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm impressed.  I ordered a salad with lettuce, an unbelievable amount of well seasoned chicken breast, black beans, rice, cilantro and guacamole.  It came in a bowl, on top of a fresh homemade tortilla, with creamy tomatillo dressing on the side.  AWESOME!  My husband insisted on dessert, (it didn't take much convincing) so we shared the coconut flan.  Oh, WOW!  Gourmet quality.   We might just return tomorrow.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great food for good prices. Has its own spin on Mexican food and makes its fresh! Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First time ever going here! $13.00 for a steak salad with 5 peaces of steak. When I asked for some salsa on the sade they tried charging me $1.00! Wow! The service was bad and food was not worth the cost! I would say first and last time b isit!"}
{"text":"Been to several cafe rio locations and they have always been great. Came to this location today to grab a salad for dinner and the manager was rude. The lettuce that she was putting on my sale was all brown and I asked her if she could give me different lettuce because I will pick all that out. She paused and seemed annoyed and pulled out new lettuce then tells the guy at the head of the line \" I guess we got to eat this salad!\" I asked her if she could add shredded cheese and she acted as if she did not hear and slid my salad. I said mam I asked for shredded cheese plz n she again seemed irritated. I asked her if she was having a bad day because she is not treating me very friendly she said no I am just hot. Will I return to cafe rio? Yes. Will I come back to this location?? Absolutely not"}
{"text":"Not so fresh! The lettuce tasted a bit off in my taco. The taco flour was soaking wet and falling apart."}
{"text":"We decided we wanted an easy and quick meal tonight, so we ordered online from Cafe Rio, since it is not even a mile away from our place. We get the food back home, and my Chicken quesadilla was made with beef or pork, not chicken. We call them to tell them, they say we can come in and get a new one. Pack up all of our other food, hoping it stays warm while we have to drive back to get the new one. This whole process took almost an hour. An hour to get dinner from a place up the block. It took less time to get fondue the other night! What was supposed to be a nice and easy dinner turned into a complete mess. By the time we got back home my husbands burrito had to be warmed up again and our queso had melted through the container it was in. At this point we weren't even that hungry anymore. Sure, they gave us a free soda and a free item next time we come in (which is more than Cappriotti's did when they screwed up and were giving out free food to everyone but us just because their register wasn't working) but dinner was ruined at this point. This is the second place this week to give us kind of crappy service, and like the 5th place within the past couple months to mess things up. I think we are done eating out for awhile. On the plus side, the queso was delish!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Cafe Rio, my family and I area not crazy about non-traditional mexican but, oooh yeah! Helloooo!!! The hand made flour tortillas.  Yum!  If you can make handmade tortillas for me, I'm sold.  When my family and I go visit Vegas, this is our one stop dining for sure.  We get the chicken and barbacoa tacos and that is enough for each of us.  For being non-traditional, this place is not bad.  I would not get more than 1 barbacoa, however, as it can get over powering.  If you do, top it with avocado and lettuce."}
{"text":"What a nightmare!! Let me tell you that normally Cafe Rio is awesome and we have a great experience! Tonight was not a good night for this location .  30 people deep in line with nobody following the process . There was a little blonde gal that was cleaning and not helping customers . This was the break in the chain ... she was suppose to be the one the put on all the toppings. Biggest concern was that nobody was managing the situation.   The phone was ringing off the hook , none of the employees were greeting , smiling or making eye contact! There was plenty of staff just no direction .   The score could have been higher if they at least apologized for the wait ! Overall a very poor experience and would probably go back but management needs to revisit the process and focus on what good looks like !!"}
{"text":"By far....the worst service and food prep in Southwest Las Vegas. I would give 0 stars but it's not an option  I swear you have to repeat your order a minimum of 3 times and they still will mess it up. The lady who was cooking the chicken was also eating the chicken at the same time. They yelled out for more chicken several times but she was too busy eating to actually realize that customers were standing around waiting on her to refill the chicken container. The food is slopped together. They don't bother letting the food sit on the grill long enough, so the cheese isn't even partially melted. The restaurant was dirty. Looked liked they hadn't swept the floors in weeks. I am a big Cafe Rio fan...but not anymore. Yikes...and if you're worried about hygiene...this isn't the place for you. They do all sorts of activities without ever changing their gloves or washing their hands. Surprised that I haven't got food poisoning."}
{"text":"They offer daily specials,  I always seem to get there when they run out.  Its happened more often then not!  I've been to the Eastern and Stephanie location on the same day a couple of times looking for the daily special with no luck."}
{"text":"Best pork tacos I've ever had.  They are amazing.  The staff was a little slower and inconsistent with their service when this location first opened but now they are all pros.  Great great food."}
{"text":"So after standing in line for almost 30mins, I was told it would be another 15mins more for an order of chips and queso.  45 mins just to get some chips and cheese.  Come on this is a staple.  I'm sorry, the food is good but a 30min + wait is not good.  I witnessed several people turn around and walk out.  The management needs to look at staffing and food prep a little better."}
{"text":"Get your poop in a group!  No music, no forks, ran out of rice, I have chopped chicken instead of shredded. The house dressing looks like chopped cilantro with ranch dressing.  I actually witnessed a guy walk out because the main order taker gave him crap for not ordering correctly."}
{"text":"Love the sweet pork. Tostada, Salad, or burrito, they are all great. The house dressing with the salad/ tostada is always a winner. Also, the best rewards program around. I love the app!"}
{"text":"Wow does the service at this location suck. Every other cafe rio in the valley that I have eaten at always taste better and always have everything ok the menu. This location seems to never have pico or limes or juices or fresh meat. The Mexican lady who I assume is a manager is completely unqualified for her position and shows no smart or common sense when talking to people. Idiots."}
{"text":"Big portions for the price and they do give military discount and they have locations everywhere except Southern California"}
{"text":"I'm not even going to comment on the quality of the food because I always leave dissatisfied because of the horrible service. I have been here many many times and not once have I gotten decent service, especially at the register. They are all rude and slow and don't really care at all about their customers. All the workers are lazy and look like they hate their lives and take it out on their customers!"}
{"text":"The food is good but that it. Super slow service. Every table dirty. Nice remodel doesn't help if it's filthy. I get that it's busy but not one person wiped down a table in the 1/2 hour we were in line. No napkins. I mean it's common sense people."}
{"text":"Yummy fire grilled chicken!  Enchiladas are amazing so it the huge salad!  Service is pretty fast, during lunch time there is usually a decent line! Overall beats Chipotle,  tastes fresher!  So if you like Chipotle you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious and a good value, the customer service is excellent. I called ahead and asked if they would be able to bring it to my car since I was returning from the vet with my dog in the car. I did not want to leave her in the car on a hot Vegas afternoon. They were more than willing to do so. This will be a regular go to spot when I need a quick and yummy meal."}
{"text":"I was getting a burrito and while the girl was wrapping it, it broke. And she was asking another worker to get another tortilla to double wrap it they said no to just throw cheese on it that I was going to eat it anyways... Presentation and customer service is everything. And I wasn't received either. My burrito was cold. And was put off by the worker who didn't just allow the worker to double wrap it. The only good thing was that kids eat free. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Food was good and today  the service was good. This location is very hit and miss. Some days it's good, other days it's horrible. I've given up on phone orders because they were constantly wrong. I like the food, but the service has kept me away from this location recently."}
{"text":"Found hair AND a piece of green sponge in my salad, can you say #vomit I went up to the counter, took manager 15 minutes to come up and talk to me. She doesn't apologize, just asks if I want it re-made... at first I said \"YES\"... then I felt soooo grossed out, and will not eat it so I got a refund. This is NOT the first time!!!!! Found hair on their tables many times before and also on rags they clean tables with!!!"}
{"text":"The menu states that the quesadilla comes with one choice of meat. Under the meat selection there is a vegetarian option listed that says beans and rice. When I received my order it was just a cheese quesadilla and they charged me extra for the guacamole.  The worker said the beans rice and guacamole did not apply to a vegetarian quesadilla.  What!?!?   So I just paid $14 for some cheese on a tortilla.  Ridiculous"}
{"text":"I've bounced through a dozen or so Mexican places looking for the same good authentic-style stuff I grew up with in San Diego. Cafe Rio now has my once-a-week \"Mexican-fix\" business. I'd have popped them 5 stars if the staff were just a bit more consistent. But, having owned a restaurant myself I understand the challenges. Overall... I am amazed at the great-tasting food from a chain (usually you only get this at a mom-n-pop)..."}
{"text":"The menu is not huge but what they offer is great. If I have had homemade tortillas before, I can't remember, but these flour tortillas are the bomb!  I love their salad and order the Fire Grilled Chicken meat to go in it. It is so fresh and the house vinaigrette is superb and adds so much flavor to an already tasty salad. By the time I hit the bottom of the bowl and get to the delicious flour tortilla, it's just the icing on the cake.  My husband gets the Pork Barbacoa burrito, enchilada style, and it is so jammed packed with meat and rice and other savory items. He loves it. And if we go for a late lunch, we don't eat dinner because the food is so filling."}
{"text":"This place has come along. Managers are great and the team is excellent, Fast and friendly! Love the nachos. I wanna be, a nacho man! Whoooo!"}
{"text":"Had a problem with our take out order, these kind of things happen all the time. I called and spoke to the manager Jessica about the mistakes. Shortly put, she handled it like a BOSS and made things right. She could not have been nicer and more accommodating. I can get a burrito anywhere in Vegas, but the customer service I received with Jessica has now prevented me from looking elsewhere. Kudos to Cafe Rio for hiring such an awesome staff, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered Postmates from this location (which was less than 10 min away) and the enchilada style burrito was so sloppy and disgusting. I frequent cafe rio often and have it delivered to my job once a week & I've never had a problem with any other location before. They left out pico & lettuce & I was just left with a big glob of tortilla and black beans. Also no napkins or silverware in bag when my delivery arrived."}
{"text":"So for eating here for the first time I want to explain to how poor the food was cold and taste disgusting. We took a bite of our soft chicken tacos and walked out the door. If you want crappy Mexican food at a high cost eat here."}
{"text":"I had the fire grilled steak tostada and it was pretty good. It could have had some more steak though. It was fully loaded and the flavors were great."}
{"text":"I'm going to get straight to the point, I love Cafe Rio, I think the food is great and the service is DREADFUL. However they have become so painfully cheap, ask for anything extra: dressing, sour cream, cheese, one extra tortilla, extra Pico everything is a charge! Come on when your customers are spending 15 bucks for lunch and asks for an extra side of sour cream, why  charge 60 cents... you just piss us off"}
{"text":"Really stunned by this place. The staff was not friendly, food was over priced for what you get, and the taste was bland. Had a pork enchilada with hot sauce. Seriously it wasn't even up to Taco Bell level. Chips were almost stale and the salsa was terrible. I feel bad leaving reviews like this but I felt compelled in this my one and only trip to Cafe Rio"}
{"text":"I am craving a Pork Barbacoa burrito as I write this! My first visit to Cafe Rio was a bit daunting, I must admit. I was meeting friends for a birthday dinner, and they had already arrived and had ordered. This is a cafeteria style restaurant. Since I wasn't familiar with the items on the menu, I told the server, 'Please be patient with me, its my first time here'. Big mistake. He shouted loudly, 'It's her first time!' And every server behind the counter started screaming, \"It's her first time! It's her first time!' OMG. Ok, after I got over the initial shock, and ordered the Pork Barbacoa burrito with black beans, with a dollop of sour cream,dollop of guacamole and some pico, I realized that heaven was in my mouth! The burrito was huge, and I really attempted to eat the whole thing, because I couldn't stop eating it~ Can't wait to go back and try their salad, and their tortilla soup. But trust me, I won't tell them it's my 2nd time there.."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio but every time I visit this location the service is the worst! The assembly line was a mess food everywhere.  After I got my order I paid the cashier then she left and walked away as I continued to wait for my receipt I finally just pulled it off the computer.  They were out of salsa and they were consistently running out of meat.  It was Wednesday at 4:45 and I was maybe the 5th or 6th person in line and it took almost 40mins. Afterwards I watched who seemed to be the supervisor mess with itching his head under his hat with his gloves on and then serve others.  Gross never going there again."}
{"text":"not a bad option for fast mexicanish food its got the ish because you know someone grandma didnt make it....lol anyway we ordered a large helping of nachos and and 2 cheese enchilada they all were good and the staff was helpful and the restaurant was clean !!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be returning to this place! Perfect for a quick bite to eat... Huge portions and very filling! The secret sauce is amazing! And if you tell them you've never been there before, you'll get a special treat ;)   I got the chicken burrito enchilada style and it was perfect! I couldn't even finish it!"}
{"text":"If Cafe Rio didn't have delicious food, they would have no business. They have horrible service and give you child sized portions for ridiculous prices. When you ask the employees for additional food to make a reasonable portion, they roll their eyes and give you the slightest pinch of food. Their sign on the door and when you call says the close at 11 on certain nights, but when you get there they are already closed."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY LOCATION BUT THIS ONE. Especially during night shift. They two boys who served me were extremely rude. I'm not over exaggerating either. The boy with glasses tossed my food around while I watched him do it to the lady next to me. After that the next boy threw the food onto my dish so sloppy. Utensils were barely stocked. Once we were done eating I asked the boy with glasses for a lid and he ignored me. The boy next to him heard me and asked me what I needed again. He told me that I can grab it myself as if he couldn't do it when I asked him. I'm so unhappy with my experience."}
{"text":"The fresh tortillas are what differentiate Cafe Rio from the competition. Hearty portions and well priced. I can do some damage on the bottomless Horchata. I also love Tuesday in particular - it's Coconut Shrimp Taco Day!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  Was on hold for 12 minutes waiting to place a to go order!  The girl told me to hold on twice! I was on hd for so long, I arrived at the store and wired on line when she finally picked up.  She didn't even say sorry!  This place really went down hill!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for lunch yesterday. We were picking between the Habit Burger Grill and Cafe Rio. I wish we would have chose the Habit. We arrived around 11:15 AM because I had to be at work at noon. We were both going to get the salad with the new spicy green chile pork. They said it was not ready yet, so we ordered the sweet pork barbacoa. They said it was not ready either. So we settled for the shredded chicken. Then, I asked for the spicy sauce on it and they said it was not ready either. At this point I was ready to just turn around and walk out and if I had been by myself I would have, but my mom decided to just stay since we didn't have much time. How do you not have 1/2 your menu ready when you open. and if its not ready, maybe you should at least take care of the customer and compensate for it. I will probably not be going back to this restraunt, and will definitely not recommend it."}
{"text":"I love their food and how organized the staff is as a team, as well as the homemade desserts!"}
{"text":"Figured we'd give this place a shot since it took over our Qdoba spot. Food isn't that bad, not sure that I like they're whole gimmick though...you'll see when you go. My main issue is with with paying extra for things like sour cream, a staple of Mexican food. Why should I have to pay extra for it, I assume it's the same with quack as well. You lose me as a customer when you pull that crap. It's one and done for Cafe Rio! Keep your sour cream!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't come to this location but it was near church and I didn't want Burger King like the rest of the family. Called in a phone order here at 2:20pm. Lady I spoke to said it would be ready for pickup in 10-15 minutes. There was about 5 people in line when I had gotten there, it was 2:40 pm, headed straight to the cashier to pay for my order and guess what? My order (salad) wasn't even made yet! The lady who I paid my order with (and also took my order because I recognize her voice) said \"your order will be ready in a minute.\" Ummm it's been over 20 minutes. If I wanted to wait, I wouldn't have wasted my time calling in my order. I sat and stared at the line and each person ordered their food and paid... all while I'm sitting there waiting for an order that I had called in that was supposed to ready, now over 10 minutes ago. I got my salad at 2:55pm---- 35 minutes after I called it in! Never again! I think I'll stick with my usual Cafe Rio location. The food is great but there is no point in saving time by calling in your order. Just wait in line. It's the same amount of time and there's a huge possibility you'd wait less!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is on a downhill.  When I tried in the past I thought it was decent, but this time, lettuce, rice and all other ingredients were very dry. So disappointing. I don't know how they could overlook it.  Go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because the food is good and they are close to my house, but the service is so bad. Always slow, mostly rude and can not handle a line. Head over to the one on Durango. It's worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time. This is what happened, placed an online order to find out it wasn't ready. Waited and waited for my food to finally get home to find a chunk of pork that is supposed to be shredded the size of a baseball in my salad. Salad had no guacamole even though it is supposed to be in the salad. Really disgusted with this location. Thanks for ruining my dinner."}
{"text":"Very slow... 4 people up front and still very very slow.  Chipotle 3 times faster, same plaza.   Food is very good as always!"}
{"text":"They served as guy with a non service dog in his arms. I told an employee to ask him to leave. They did not. They served him with the dog on his arms. Then he sat down inside and ate his meal. I could not believe it.  January 13, 2018 at 9:00 PM. Richard"}
{"text":"This place has got it together. I was clearly leading with my stomach when I walked in here during lunch rush, the line was sooooooo long, literally about 20 people deep. I considered walking out but took a chance and toughed it out. I only waited about 5 minutes!   Everyone in the line was so quick, but very courteous and made everything to order. Everyone was smiling and having a great time, while being super busy! One staff member was in training! The menu options are great. The ingredients are fresh and delicious.   *get a side of the salad dressing, it's unbelievably good. I described it as \" the best ranch you have ever had with a kick and a bit of something green\""}
{"text":"overall the food was pretty good! be sure to ask for salsa and guac in the burrito, unlike chipotle they dont put inside. the horchata is great!"}
{"text":"I love the smell as soon as you walk in.  Like the taste of a homemade flour tortillas? Or if you would like to find out, then this is your chance.  I have never been a fan of Mexican or Tex Mex chain restaurants but Cafe Rio has definitely changed my mind and taste buds.    I highly recommend the shredded beef, pinto beans, cilantro rice, shredded cheese,pico de gallo, and enchilada style burrito topped with a little sour cream and a side salad and ahhhhh!!! Just come with patience cause the service is a hit or miss but more of a miss(hence the 4 stars) They also have house made desserts  and great drink selection. Definitely not bad for a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now and I'm so disappointed. Lettuce is brown, rice is hard and overcooked. They made me new tostada only after I picked it up and smelled it to make sure the lettuce was still good. Ladies behind the counter are rude and act like helping us is the most annoying thing on the planet. I love Cafe Rio but will never be back to this location. Totally disappointed. Take the time to drive to a different location."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Cafe Rio, as so many people have told me how wonderful it is.  The line really took me aback, and they had only one cashier.  We went at 1:45 on a Friday.  The guys on making the food did a fantastic job.  Paying was a nightmare.  Food was cold by the time we were able to eat, even though we live only 10 minutes away.  Finally, they forgot my salad dressing, so my salad was bland and dry.  I will give Cafe Rio another try someday, so that I can discover what all of my friends are raving about."}
{"text":"Huge portion....interesting concept....kinds fast food...but made right in front of you.  I enjoyed the salad and could have it like I wanted.  I would go back with hesitations"}
{"text":"You had me at Queso Dip...  Obviously I love their Queso.  It has such a rich and delicious flavor.  I could live off of that alone.  Enough about Queso... They have other good food.  Their grilled chicken salad is awesome! So huge and so filling.   The tortillas are all made there in the restaurant. They definitely compliment every meal they are included with.    -and yes the salad is also in a large tortilla.    The service here has always been consistent with a  very friendly staff.  They are helpful and accommodating to your choices and options.     Parking here is a bit cramped in the front and side.  There is always additional parking in back by Total Wine.  But it's obviously easy to find being located right off of Stephanie and Warm Springs.    I'll be back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"1st timer. Service is EXCELLENT  food is good however I will have to down rate due to the fac t that ALL the tables were dirty. Even the few wiped down. They are so HORRIBLY grimy someone had carved initials in the grime..... NOT GOOD"}
{"text":"It actually pains me to leave one star because i'm addicted to cafe rio it's so good. This location always has so many problems and they never seem to get fixed so I hope corporate sees this review and wips this location into shape. Their whipped cream maker is always broken and they consistently give me the key lime pie with watery whipped cream even though I've complained to the manager multiple times. Last week I got a salad and they didn't put any guacamole which is supposed to come on it... today I went in and asked for corn tortilla enchiladas because i'm sensitive to gluten and the girl making tortillas said they just didn't have any? I would've been fine with waiting for her to make some more. I could honestly go on and on about how painfully slow they are as well. The last 2 times I've been in the worker just leaves the line and my food is sitting out of the little oven or just sitting on the line and I'm staring around wondering why they just decided to turn around and do something else.. it shouldn't take more than 3 minutes to make a burrito when i'm the only one in line and it will literally take 10-15 minutes. Ugh. Please get new management and get this place together so I don't have to drive to the farther location."}
{"text":"Food is great but person cooking the food is a little rude not friendly. When I asked him for cilantro he said your tacos don't come with it. I asked if could please have some he did give me some. This was just a few minutes ago 6/8/18 I been here once before he was yelling at workers  He might be manager. If he worked if I go again I will just drive to chipotle."}
{"text":"I came here picking up for myself and two other friends..  I was originally upset because Upon arrival I was notified that they were out of the pork tamales I ordered online and that the rice was going to take 15 minutes to make a new batch. I normally wouldn't mind but friends food was already done and packed to go so it'll be especially cold once mine is fine.!Because of the inconvenience they accommodated me with chips and queso. It still took quite a while for them to pack up my food so by the time I left the rice was done and I got a scoop of that as well. Great job turning a bad thing good"}
{"text":"Great food and menu. Always enjoy the fresh fix'ins. I usually get the steak salad with extra meat. I enjoy taking out of town guests and make them order extra cheese to get the \"extra cheese\" response from employees. All time fav. is the tres leches."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to write this review for a very long time. Mostly because I've been waiting to go out to Gilbert for a very long time. Ha.   Since I am counting down the days till my exit from this awesome Valley of the Sun, I am trying to hit up all the things that were on my Valley bucket list, and on them: go to Gilbert to visit Cafe Rio (even though there are a few Vegas locations).  I used to frequent Cafe Rio in Salt Lake (Fort Union) during my senior year of high school and in the years following. Those who are in the know, are aware this this place was around before that \"other\" burrito chain from that \"other\" city in the mountains. The one that is named after a chili pepper and later got bastardized by McDonalds, even though I still love and eat there.  If you are from the Salt Lake City area, you know this place has a cult following with a line out the door. It's ridiculous at times.  Anyway....  Things to eat at Cafe Rio:  Burrito (duh). Try it Enchilada style. The fire grilled chicken is pulled, instead of cubed. Also, it's clearly marinated, and tasty.  The pork salad. They are famous for this. The pork is slow cooked and is a little sweet, but is sooo good, and topped with house made tortilla strips, and this cilantro dressing that will make you squeal like the pig you are about to devour.  ALL of their tortillas are made in-house and in front of you.   They have a variety of sodas with crushed ice, including mexican coke. Also, they have the mexican fountain juices like mango pineapple. Yum!  This place is worth the drive, no matter where you are coming from.   I can't wait for my next trip to Cafe Rio. They now have locations in Vegas, Southern California, Maryland, Virginia, and Colorado."}
{"text":"They say the third time is a charm,  it's not. This place continues to disappoint me. The people working are here for a job and that is about it. The lady making tortillas looks miserable and getting through the line takes on average 10 minutes.  The food is okay. Its bland and the rice is always under-cooked.  In general the place is clean, buy watching their food prep is leaves little to be desired. I am frankly surprise that no one gets sick. I will say that for the price it's a good value, but not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Someone described the CR to me a Zaba's on Monster drink.  Though it's right across  from the college, there was a nice relaxing vibe to be enjoyed a lunch time.  Super friendly staff made ordering easy and laid down what was good.  My extra chicken salad was great!  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Good food, fresh made, line maintenance is still HORRIBLE!! It's not fun to repeat your order 10 times and have the people not look at you when talking to them and then they say, \"what was that again?\"... right...   Great place to eat though. Food is amazing and despite bad line management it's worth it. If you're in a hurry, try another place. People are friendly and service is good. It's not their fault they are pulled 100 ways on the line. Once management fixes this while keeping the quality this place will get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Hated it.  I don't know what else to say. I never ever send food back. Maybe three times in my life. I asked them to remake my burrito, and they did. Which was nice of them, but the next one was just as gross.   I am not a fan."}
{"text":"Their salad with that vinaigrette? Man... Burrito with habanero sauce (amazing stuff)... Grab some flan and a horchata? All in about 5 minutes. These people run at assembly line pace.. And they're friendly enough. Word of advice : grab utensils-fork, knife and spoon- every time (ever) no matter what you order.. You're welcome"}
{"text":"Surprised that the reviews are all over the place. We have been 3 times now since they opened and always been very happy. The service is fast, the food is good, prices are fair. Andrew loves the sweet pork. It is good but a little to much sweet for me. I love all the other meats! The different sauce choices for both inside and outside the burritos is fantastic. I love being able to customize everything. Portions are huge, at times we split a burrito and are great. We grab a side of chips and dip and it is plenty of food. When we are starved I have been known to eat a whole burrito on my own!   Download their apps for points and deals. It is easy to use and might as well get the points and earn free food!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be a tad pricey but you certainly get a lot of food for your money. This would be optimal if you were somehow able to salvage what would be left of your burrito to eat later, but unfortunately I found this to not be the case. Overall, it was a decent meal, the meat on my burrito was the best part. However, avoid the salsa! It just tastes like it wasn't meant to go on food."}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal. I waded thru the Disneyland 'esque line reading the menu board and decided on the salad bowl.  All the while I was thinking this place is just a glorified Chipotle with the assembly line and all. And I'm not too crazy over the food  there either! I don't even frequent the larger chain restaurants, so what the heck am I here in the first place?  Oh! For the supposedly Sweet Pork Barbacoa Salad that I've read is \"ahhhmazing\", \"so awesome\". Well I don't know about that, it tasted okay for me. It was sweet though, too darn sugary sweet.   Yes the tortillas are fresh but I'm not too crazy about them either. I tore a piece to take a bite and thought it was kind of dry almost brittle like. Mine didn't have any taste to it.   Don't get me wrong the food here is not bad,  just this typical type of Mexi food is not my cup of Horchata."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Cafe Rio!! But Avoid this location!!! The staff is super sleepy , its like they came from party from last night straight to work...they dont listen to datails, they are rood ... one of them starts telling a story from last night and everyone stops making your food and listens to the story... told them 3 times no sour cream!!! She took a scoop and dumped a giant dump on my salad!!! My wife said and i said NO , SOUR CREAM!!! WHEN THEY chit chat like this where is the manager?"}
{"text":"First time here. I have seen them around but avoided them because I thought they would be bland. I was wrong. Everything was yummy but the stand out for me was the cilantro dressing. Ordered a side of it for my pork taco and it took something yummy and made it yummier. The other delicious treat was the strawberry lemonade. Not to strawberry with a hint of melon? Either way it was quenching to say the least. It's giving the restraurants around it a run for their money"}
{"text":"Worst decision I made all week. The people making the food were sloppy and unsocial, their \"enchilada style\" is a bowl of soup with a tortilla in the middle basically. Restaurant was dirty with overflowing trash cans. And way over priced. Hated it."}
{"text":"The people who work here are irritating. They are rude and yell too much. What ever happened to \"thank you have a nice day\" and a smile. It's not that complicated to not be a dick."}
{"text":"Arrived with the GF before a trip to the nearby wholesale shopping mega store a little before lunch time.  After walking in we were met with a little bit of line but it moved quickly.  I ordered up a delicious chicken salad and found all the ingredients to be fresh and tasty.  Not to impressed with the friendliness of those working behind the counter, but I am willing to chalk it up to having their game faces on in preparation for the lunch time rush.  As we say down to eat our delicious chow, the line grew and the dining area became much more crowded.  All in all, I will be back."}
{"text":"Popped in with the GF to grab a bite in the early evening hours.  I thought we might avoid crowds and be able to get in, eat and punch out.  I was wrong on only one of my assumptions.......BUSY.  The parking lot is shared with another eatery and custard place.  It was packed.  Fortunately for us the parking fairy smiled on us and we were able to get a spot up close.  I say this not to discourage anyone, it's only to say if you have to park a little bit further north do so.  The walk will be good for after you stuff your face.  Despite the crowd, the line moves quickly.  Everyone of the other side of the counter seemed to be busting their asses to move things along.  I ordered up a fire grilled chicken salad with a cilantro dressing that is amazing.  The salad part is placed in a tortilla bowl with cheese melted at the bottom.    In addition to the salad and the GF's chicken burrito we ordered some chips and queso dip. Perhaps I could have done without that.  The queso dip was a little watery for my taste.  This was my second trip to a Cafe Rio, my first at this location.  I am a fan and if asked to go to Cafe Rio to dine I would absolutely go."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Never use them for catering if you need something reliable.   Can barely even reach anyone. Get hung up on by staff when I do."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was not. No one took the time to acknowledge us. There was nothing left to drink in regards to the horchata, mint limeade, etc., and half the tables were all dirty. Meanwhile it was slow. ...at least the food was good. :)"}
{"text":"Absolute most unorganized location in the nation. Try making a phone order and show up when requested. You'll still wait another 30 minutes. Total loss of customer service. If this was a restaurant it would definitely go out of business. Only reason they serve good is because it's laid out for the workers. Otherwise I'm afraid how long the food would actually take. Unfortunate because some locations are organized."}
{"text":"I love this place :). My husband and I are cult followers of cafe rio.  Their salads are perfect and they have vanilla coke in the fountain and key lime pie.  Perfect storm for us to worship the place.  I think it is because they make everything fresh."}
{"text":"Very average food. I've had several items on their menu and nothing stood out. It's not horrible, but with places like Zabas and Chipotle (similarly priced w/ better food) I have no desire to go back here."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I used to love this cafe Rio so today when I went in I was VERY disappointed. Not only was the line very gross but the customer service was the worst, Juan seemed very bothered, asking me what I want on my food, I asked for the beans and rice that come with my purchase, he threw my plate down and exhaled deeply, as if it was the biggest deal for him to do his job, his attitude was so bad that the 2 customers BEHIND me even complained and asked another worker for his name. Don't go to this cafe rio expecting to be welcomed...  If he doesn't like his job maybe he shouldn't be working there."}
{"text":"Best salad with fresh home made tortillas everyday! We usually get the cafe rio salad. I love the their special carnitas tacos as well. Fresh and quick!"}
{"text":"The cleanliness of this place leaves much to be desired.   My fat ass was thoroughly enjoying a bowl of yummy queso when a peppermint flavor attacked my taste buds. Moments later, I spit out the soft, unmistakable lump of someone else's gum. Fucking disgusting.   I should have known when I looked at my potential protein options and saw a Jackson Pollock of sauces splayed fucking EVERYWHERE. The canvas had no limitations. Order anything you want because chances are you're gonna get a little of everything anyway. That's okay with me; I enjoy variety.   Thank goodness I got takeout because if I stayed long enough to notice anything else I probably would have eaten my food anyway, because that's how you build up your immune system right?   Pretty basic order: I got a Chicken Quesadilla and boyfriend got a  Grilled Steak Quesadilla. The guacamole was surprisingly good. The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful. The grilled steak was chewy and gristly and I did not enjoy it at all. They put heaps of cheese on these things, which I was excited to see as they made my order. But in the end I had a soggy mess that was far too greasy to be enjoyable.   Overall I give this place 10/10 for tummy aches and entertainment, as the kitchen crew's passionate sing-a-long to the classic jams of Boyz II Men was rather delightful."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is always good. We come for the salads and spicy tomatillo ranch. It's the best. We have called and ordered for pick up at this Horizon Location and had no problems. Always friendly to us."}
{"text":"BUSY......still good service, except cashier was a bit cold, not friendly like the rest if crew. Good, burrito good ad usual .  Here again, very busy, still good service.  And Steak Burrito is gooooood!  Ok food, like the steak burrito"}
{"text":"So i wont really review the food...it's great. But today my UNR student daughter who came to town to surprise me, but i had found out in advance and then had my wife tell her i was out of town...so she took her to cafe rio where i was waiting, to surprise her. Confused? Big tear moment...but then cafe rio jeffrey with erics (?) help surprised us with a free desert to \"celebrate whatever the tears were for\" Class act people!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we are when we moved to Henderson one year ago. We drove around until we saw this place and stopped. The burritos are excellent and large. They have a different twist compared to chipotle or qdoba. My husband got the salad with steak and it was great too! We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"terrible! i ordered online to be picked up at 915 pm i arrived at 9:32 apologizing i was late and my food wasn't even fulfilled yet. i said no worries i'll wait i noticed the employee put the incorrect type of dressing and i paid for an extra one i had to remind the cashier  too, when the cashier asked the male employee to get my extra salad  dressing he just stared completely blanked at her and walked away, for about 30 seconds i said miss he will not get the dressing..\"can i have my dressing please?\"at that time i was furious. I had to think twice and take a deep breath.. I guess Anger Management is working.. but damn they need to have a meeting.. the employees are not structured to work as a team"}
{"text":"Always get the house salad...addicted...they have the best green dressing. The pulled pork is the moistest with it. Not sure I like the new remodeling they did. I miss the old style they had with all the tables and chairs but it still looks nice and clean.They are always busy"}
{"text":"Great food honestly but the rotating options (which depend on the day ) are hard to deal with when you want what you want (ex: salmon is only on fridays and Fideo is only on sundays). Staff is always nice! The tres leches is good for a fast food place. Great app with great rewards. Clean place."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant is convenient, but we tend to come late, like 1-1.5 hours before closing and every time the are already breaking down the drink bar -and have to have them pour the lemonade in my cup out of the storage bin. Classy. Like a previous complaint the employees took a while to even greet us. I hope ownership takes note of these complaints so we can keep this close location open And desirable. Out of beef and shrimp tonight. Sounds like a trend."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cafe Rio several times and they're usually quite busy. Their lunch time rush gets pretty packed, but the service is usually quick. However, something about their food just misses the mark. I usually get one of their burritos, and it's either too bland or too salty. The portion sizes aren't bad, but I think their price point could be better. I may try this place out again in the future, but I really don't recommend it especially with so many other similar chains"}
{"text":"Here's the inside scoop. The M and M review is spot on. I have been here a few times and really wanted to like this place as my go to Mexican joint. The food is good so that's 1 star. There is always one helpful employee so that's 2 stars.  That's where it ends. They do nickel and dime you but you won't know it until it's time to pay. The type of chicken I choose was an extra dollar. The type of sauce my wife picked was extra, so was the cheese on top. The amount of meat they give is horribly low. Don't ask for extra though or you will pay more. Before you know it your burrito is $14 bucks. There are always 5 employees but somehow no one to ring us up. It kinda looks like a prison run lunch room. I wonder if they are told to sneak in extra charges for everything and not tell the customer. TELL US IF SOMETHING IS AN UPCHARGE. Two times I got charged extra for enchilada style, which I didn't even order but paid for and still didn't get. Getting hot sauce in a burrito isn't enchilada style is it? Your menu doesn't think so. Not worth turning around and complaining for 1-2 bucks after you leave and realize it.  The cherry on top was they ask you to fill out a survey online. I went to do it and it said sorry we cannot verify the information you entered and cannot continue. So I guess you really don't want to hear feedback then? Well you are going to get it one way or the next.  Seems like a decent place to eat that is horribly run.  I am one of the disappointed ones, unfortunately. But I can't only give you the benefit of doubt so many times before I give up."}
{"text":"Normally cafe rios are excellent but the lack of customer svc makes this one a 3-star.    No ice in the drink machine and the ice tea as well as limeade was out.  The later was out from when we got there to the end!  Hopefully someone in management will help re-align then."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a Chipotle derivative... and I think it's ok... honestly, if it wasn't a favorite of my girlfriend I'm not sure how often I would go here. There are better mexican food places, at more affordable prices and the service is typical of fast casual dining ilk. If you're going to go, I suggest the tacos but be sure to ask for salsa or you'll have absolutely minimal flavor and zero heat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get burritos in town, as someone who finds chipotle overrated I try to go to cafe rio whenever the opportunity arises. The food is always fresh and the staff is always courteous and kind."}
{"text":"After hearing good things from a friend that's addicted to this place, I finally went. Was late on a Sunday so not many people... so you would think asking a question or two wouldn't be a problem. The girls behind the counter were clearly hating life and were abrupt. Chicken, steak or pork and corn or flour were my options. I opted for pork...which I had heard was their specialty. Sweet pork sounded interesting so why not? Right...? Literally the nastiest crap I've ever tasted. Spent $14 on 3 tacos and 2 drinks which is a tad upsetting when you realize the food is so sickeningly sweet you can't even eat it. I managed to douse it with hot sauce so much that it almost canceled the sweetness out but we ended up drawing straws to see who had to eat the last taco and then decided to just throw it away. Over priced nasty food and people that work there don't want to help you. Will stick to Chipolte or pretty much any other place."}
{"text":"Their employees and manager have no respect for Law Enforcement. They think it's ok to make inappropriate comments to police officers and make them so uncomfortable they leave before even ordering their food. We will never step food in another Cafe Rio again."}
{"text":"I have to say that I normally LOVE Cafe Rio, but this location has let me down. It's close to home but I can't continue to patronize them. Every time I go they mess up my order. The last time when I went in there was a pile of trash that had been swept right in front of the counter, just left there. Gross. The women's restroom was broken so my Mom had to use the men's and she said it was filthy. I got my usual pork salad and I've been sick for 3 days now since I ate it, and I only ate maybe a fourth of it. The girl who took my order over the phone was rude as well. It's a shame because I know that other locations are good. My advice is to avoid the west Sahara store at all costs!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!! by far the best of all of the places such as this.  I have never had a bad meal.  the queso dip is the best I have ever had!  And the fact you get to custom build everything on the menu to your liking is wonderful (especially since Im pregos lol)  The staff is always friendly and smiling.  There hasn't been a time yet that I go there and it is slow, that says something!  The pork nachos are one of the best things!! I recommend sharing them!!  My BF and I usually get two things and share them, that way you get the best of both worlds!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because the food is good. The workers/ employees are completely incompetent. This was my first visit, and to be honest it'll probably be my last. I ordered a salad because the picture looked amazing! When I got my salad it looked NOTHING like the picture. So they ended up giving everything on the side and I had to assemble it myself. Then I go to order dessert. I ordered with the first girl (tres leches with everything in it), stand in line the whole time then to have 2 different girls tell me, all full of attitude, \"you don't need to wait in line for desserts you can just go to the register\". After waiting for 5 more minutes I finally get my dessert. Again it looks nothing like the picture. The dessert itself looks like it was thrown around, and there's no whip cream. When I go and ask about the whip cream I get more attitude about how the whip cream can isn't working. I would only recommend going here if you know exactly what you want AND you're ready to deal with a bunch of high schoolers attitude."}
{"text":"Love love cafe rio. Their quesadillas are soooo good. Also their rewards app makes me want to go there more often because you get $10 free for every 100 points."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place was terrible. I've had better service at taco bell. The staff wouldn't look at me when taking my order. They just kept their head down and then got mad when i couldn't hear what they were asking me. Lift your head up, look at the customer and use your voice and maybe you wouldn't have to repeat yourself. When I got near the end, the girl just pointed at a stack of trays and plastic bowls and just stared at me. After about 10 seconds she got irritated and asked me if the order was for here or to go with an attitude. Every table was cluttered with food bits, used napkins and used utensils. The staff at this location needs to grow up and realize that a job is a privilege. Work there like you want the damn job."}
{"text":"The food is really good but I am really tired of having the same problems every time I go.  I have allergies and cannot have any tortillas and every time I explain, #1 They cannot hear me because of the very tall glass that is VERY inconvenient, #2. It is like I am ordering the strangest thing, they don't seem to get it when all the similar restaurants have bowls available, #3. They're very inconsistent with the amount of meat they'll give you and #4. They do not know how to price it! I have paid $4.00 and change up to $9.00 and change, it is always different.  This is my issue with Cafe Rio, I dislike the ordering my bowl very very much. Terrible customer service.  Please Cafe Rio create one new menu item called BOWL and train your employees about the portions for the meat.  I really have tried it all and it's always different. I would like to be able to just say can I have a bowl, and get rice, beans, meat, lettuce, pico, and a sauce, and the protein portion to be fair. Please consider this request. Otherwise, I like the food and it has good prices."}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave reviews but this place was that terrible that I had to lmao. Came in while there were two people working in which only 1 was preparing orders as the other one walked around and did nothing. Before taking my order, guy who was preparing the food went on his phone. Stingy with the servings & another person walked in for their shift, saw it was busy, and said he was gonna head to the back instead."}
{"text":"worst location ever! they all have their heads up their damn, mother fucking asses!!! thet messed up my entire order! them fucking assholes!!!"}
{"text":"I waited until my 4th visit to write a review and there will not be a 5th visit. Each time I have gone there has been a group of \"unsupervised\" teens working. I'm sure was a manager there but not doing his/her job.  The food quality is only so-so. The first time I went, the workers were not paying attention to the food going through the oven and 3 of the containers fell on the floor. The next time the individuals working the counter just did not pay attention to the order. I had to tell them several times what I wanted.  The third time was actually decent.  It was during the week and that may make a difference.  This last time, I was the only one in there. I ordered a steak dish and they discovered that they ran out. The young lady in the back just said \"oh I forgot.\"  There were 5 people (4 teen girl and a woman) working!! When I walked in, all 5 were standing around doing nothing but talking!! The prep area was a mess. They really need to get some adequate management for the weekends."}
{"text":"Great food choices and the dishes are always fresh. My favorite dish is the coconut mango tacos but they only serve them on Tuesdays.  The prices are a little higher than most restaurants of this type they but they give you excellent portions.  Definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Fresh tortillas, fresh ingredients all the way around. Chicken, pork and beef are excellent. This is a great addition to Resturant' row on Tatum. Enjoy! Service is great too"}
{"text":"So over priced. The staff are super slow, rude and couldn't make it any more obvious that they don't want to be there. Lots of attitude. Not to mention the line is filthy and the lettuce is in the pico, the shredded beef in the chicken etc. I think management has failed when it comes to organization of the staff and the standard of the line. The food is good. But I paid like 12 dollars for a burrito with mostly rice and beans....I feel let down. There is chicken somewhere in my burrito but mostly rice. The sour cream is extra. I think that's ridiculous considering how sparse the burrito is. Won't ever go here again..."}
{"text":"Huge portions,  friendly staff and great taste.  I always get the sweet pork Salad with their delicious house dressing.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but if you enjoy tasty ingredients and hand made tortillas this is the place for you. Very popular with ASU students. Food had an authentic feel."}
{"text":"We went to Cafe Rio on Taco Tuesday after 6 pm for the first time. I was informed that you will have to wait when you arrive. I did take about a half hour before the process is complete. So if your in a hurry,  I would go  when you have time. Every day they have a special. I had to try a taco (which was good) for only $1.95. It was the sweet shredded pork with lettuce and pico de gallo. I also had huge burrito with there grilled chicken. I comes with black or pinto beans, cilantro rice, lettuce and pico de gallo. If you want cheese and enchilada sauce those are other options that come with you burrito.  My wife is a vegetarian. The options are pretty limited. With any vegetarian choice you pick there are not any roasted or saute veggies that you can  add. You are only getting rice, beans, lettuce , pico de gallo and guacamole. The guacamole is a little ball. If you want more it's and extra charge. I would go back to Cafe Rio but on a limited basis."}
{"text":"Food was definitely not great. Hardly any meat in the tacos and tons of lettuce. Chicken was bland, beef was dry. We threw them all in the trash. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We visited this location on Taco Tuesday - tacos are $1.95 each and you can add a drink, rice, and beans for an additional 2 bucks!  Great food, but the wait on Taco Tuesday was about 30 minutes.  Plenty of seating, including outdoors.  One taco with beans and rice is enough for most folks, IMO, and that translates to a 4 buck meal - incredible!"}
{"text":"This is my fifth and last time coming to this cafe rio. Every single time I attempt to try again thinking that the last time was a fluke and someone was having a bad day or something but every time I come back it gets worse. When arriving up to the counter to order they were clearly rushing us through, the guy ahead of me was very frustrated as the girl asked numerous times why he ordered and what he wanted on it because she wasn't paying attention she was flirting and holding a conversation with the other worker. The guy taking the orders by the tortillas said \"ma'am what do you want?\" So I asked for what I wanted and he didn't take time to ask if I wanted anything else before he asked the girl behind me what she wanted, so I had to rudely interrupt and say I actually have two more meals I would like to get, he then rolls his eyes and rushes through my order. Fast forward to the payment, I was charged for an extra pork salad so she then they only Gave me one of the two pork salads.. then I went to fill up my drink and one of the workers was cleaning the floor under the drink station so I waited holding my cup for Him to finish and 3-4 minutes go by and he's looked at me knows I'm waiting on him so I said excuse me can i get a drink and he said ya go ahead, and didn't move at all so I had to reach over him. This was all just one visit... other visits I've been skipped for my order being taken, my pork salads have had rocks in them, it's just terrible when it comes to customer service at this location. I'm very disappointed in the staff here. I will Not be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch after a few recommendations from friends. Decided to go with the 'award winning' Pork Barbacoa burrito, which while delicious, quickly fell apart in my hands leaving their sauce everywhere and causing me to have to get a knife/fork to finish it. The restaurant has a very similar ordering/seating arrangement to Chipotle/Qdoba. I was very pleased with the serving size compared to a similar meal at Chipotle, and with it being rather close to home, I'll be sure to stop by and try some other dishes (hopefully ones that don't fall apart after 2 bites)."}
{"text":"First off this location is new so perhaps their process will improve. I called in for take out, some how my order was lost. Ok fine- but the worker proceeded to blame a call center not processing the order and going around and around how it's not their fault instead of just putting the order in again and making it.  Clearly don't do take out here. The food was still delicious and the quality I have come to know from other cafe Rios."}
{"text":"How can people not LOVE this place!! Best ever!! All those hot sauces, fresh made food, friendly service. So, so good. You Yelpers are outta your minds!"}
{"text":"YOU REALLY NEED TO READ THIS. I wish I was able to post a picture but I was so grossed out, I left the dinner table and thankfully my daughter had taken away my food. I ordered beef enchiladas. Little did I know the beef was HEART!!! The chewy, hard to bite first bite was a freaking VALVE of a HEART!! I can't even believe it still. Bluck!!"}
{"text":"So, we go to Cafe Rio fairly regularly but tonight has finally put the nail in the coffin.  We ordered online and although the order was finished on time, it was a mess! We ordered a chicken burrito that was SLOP! The tortilla was so soggy, it was disgusting! Then, I ordered and paid for 2 sides of guacamole and received only one. Also, ordered a side of sour cream, didn't get that either!! Oh and the two Fresca's I ordered didn't come in the bag. If people would read the ticket, things like this wouldn't happen. It was simple and in black and white. Just read it!! To top it off, my daughter picked it up and was treated very rudely. She's younger and wasn't even handed the drink we bought. This was a complete waste of my money and time!"}
{"text":"So we placed a to go order online for pick up at 6:30. I arrived a bit early (6:20) and the ticket hadn't even been removed from the printer. The young man at the cash register went and got it and asked the guy and girl to start it since I was there. I even offered to stand in line as there wasn't even anyone in line. The girl who's name I later found out was VANESSA was one of the rudest, snottiness things I've ever come across. Her attitude while preparing my 3 tostadas and 2 quesadillas was absolutely terrible. My 10 year old ask for more tortilla strips and what did she get, a dirty look and no strips. The cashier guy nicely put on a glove and added more to her tostada. She was definitely \"too good\" to be working there. Her attitude was unbelievable. I understand we all have bad days however, take a break while you're at work and come back ready to do what you're being paid to."}
{"text":"Finally a Cafe Rio without the snooty employees. I went to the one on Blue Diamond (once) and will never go there again. I got yelled at by one of the employees for wanting a Burrito Enchilada Style w/out cheese. He was upset because he had to throw it out since he was too busy not listening to me in the first place. This Cafe Rio is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"In general I prefer costa vida over cafe rio, but this location is particularly bad. I've been here about 4 or 5 times since they opened because it's closer to home than costa vida. The food is not fresh, and the ingredients are messy and disorganized.  Today I got a tostada and chips and queso. The tostada itself, the chips and the tortilla strips were all stale and ruined each dish. The pork was flavorless and fatty. The queso at this location has been out of stock half of my visits, and the other half the consistency has been off. Blah not coming back to this location. 2 stars for friendly service."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly.  Soup was terrific and i forgot how LARGE their tacos were!  everything was very good although they could take a little more care and time in cleaning up the prep table... the fact that thats the main thing people see they should clean it a lot more often... very messy and gross!"}
{"text":"Good food. But don't order online. Their lines are usually butt to nut, so I ordered online, with their cool new app. I placed my order for designated time.  Got here and no one was ready to take my order. Waited a few min at the register to find out it wasn't ready. I paid. Waited. Saw 3 people walk in and get their food who arrived after me. Might as well walk in and get it. Those people are long gone. I'm still sitting here."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has THE BEST food, but this location has not gotten an order correct once. When ordering online, don't expect your food to be made until you get there. Make sure to check it or you will get home and find out your order is wrong!"}
{"text":"Menu is like Chipotle-pick your meat, pick your style (i.e. taco, burrito, etc), except this place is waaay overpriced for average food. Seriously bland. Paid extra for a lump of guacamole the size of an M&M. Staff was friendly but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is good but wtf a customer fell & no one said anything!!!!! Secondly they have no tres leches cake ugh Service is slow cuz other employees instead of helping the line move just stand around talking... not good"}
{"text":"I went there with my family, ordered a salad and for $8.95 and all I got was a bunch of lettuce, very little meat with a spoonful of guacamole. The cashier acted like she was doing us a favor when asked if we could get a container for my daughter. They need to learn that customers keep them in business."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed in this place, my daughter found a long dark curly hair in her bean and cheese burrito. Enough said!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Cafe Rio yesterday in hopes to get a few tacos. Note.. I am a person with celiac.. yes I'm aware a lot of businesses don't cater to gluten free. But I thought I'd give it a shot after a hard day of work. I walked in and the 3 people working the food line were all chatting with the \" manager \" from what it looked like. He had dark hair with gauges. They were slouched over the counters and did not welcome me in or ask if I had questions(which I did) when I was ready to order the guy was still talking to another employee over me, she actually had to tell him to quit talking before I could get a word out.. meanwhile another employee is standing there playing in the cheese! Lol. The girl making my tacos asked if I wanted anything else and I asked \" is your rice gluten free? \" and she asked the guy if it was.. he replied to me \" uhhh no not at all, if you're like really into eating gluten free or something or actually that sensitive or whatever you should probably just leave \" my face instantly turned red and I left in tears. I went and tried blaze pizza down the way and the first thing they asked me when I asked for a gluten free crust was \" is it an allergy ? \" YES thank you blaze for taking me seriously and turning my night around.. i was so humiliated in that restaurant, I won't be back to Cafe rio and neither will my friends and family I've told this to."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over 2 years and it's been consistent with the food....LOVE it totally...fresh and of course the handmade tortillas give you the authentic feel...It's reasonably priced especially in comparison to some others that are not as fresh. It's always busy so that makes me feel great in knowing the food is fresh..My one gripe is a lot of these employees lack GREAT customer service skills. Manager please train them better because some are very rude...I love the location however I will find somewhere else to eat if this doesn't change. Quite a few of my friends have complained as well..."}
{"text":"The food was good but the manager Felipe was absolutely rude. He rolled his eyes when I asked for some cheese on my salad, was bad mouthing the employees saying, \" I hate when you guys use the fucking bathroom, always take so fucking long,\" and gave me attitude and lip for asking for more guacamole in the cup that I had gotten as an appetizer. I understand there's a certain amount in which can be given, but of the cup, he gave barely a half scoop. Even the cashier looked at the cup and was surprised to how little he gave me. I don't see myself coming back because of Felipe"}
{"text":"First star was for cleanliness. Second was for the new decor of the restaurant.  The staff was rude. The girl at beginning of the line rolled her eyes when I asked for flour tortillas. She slopped the meat all over and didn't even roll my enchiladas. When I got home my first bite was COLD. I guess she forgot to run it through the oven. The cheese didn't melt on the inside!  I also got charged an extra dollar for my meal even though both enchiladas were pork.  I'm pretty much done with cafe rio at this point. They used to be so good and they just aren't the same anymore."}
{"text":"I haven't been there for a while but I do not remeber everything being extra. I got a salad no tortilla, little Rice black beans ans asked if the green sauce was spicy they said no and I asked for a little and said it was extra........I was like.....okay......then asked what else. I usually use to the guacamole being extra so I asked for a little cheese. They said that was extra for a salad. Well guess I saved more calories. So I said no. The lettuce at times tastes bitter and was just not happy. Later I looked at my receipt at home and they charged me less. So that made up for me being a little annoyed that I felt they were going to charge extra for everything. I really was disappointed this time. But it won't turn me away forever."}
{"text":"Food is always good, that is if you can get it still warm. The wait times are absolutely awful. From Utah originally I was able to eat at the first location many, many times. Unfortunately over the years as they have expanded locations the service and wait times have drastically declined. I've stopped going all together."}
{"text":"It never fails!! I order online and go to pick it up, get back into the car (if I'm lucky) or get Home to find that my order isn't right!! It's not hard to look at the order while making the food to make sure you've added things or left things off as it was asked for on the receipt! I don't have time to do their job for them. If they can't read the receipt and get the customers order correct, they shouldn't be working there!"}
{"text":"I actually really like the food here but their employees are AWFUL! It's like they get paid to not make eye contact and ignore you. You can stand at the pick up counter for 10 minutes before someone acknowledges you. And then they give you attitude! They really need to make some changes here. Could be so much better but their staff just ruins it."}
{"text":"Look out for hairs!!  Went for lunch recently.  Service at this location is good.   Ordered a salad with half green chile pork and half sweet pork.  The food was good, but about halfway through I found a small clump of hairs in the pork.   Really, hairs are common in food and normally not a deal killer for me.   However, until now, I've never found a clump of multiple hairs.   Was a little gross, but I just threw them on the ground and finished my food.  May or may not be back to this location."}
{"text":"The food tasted okay though the depth of flavor and spices were mild. If you're one who cannot handle or does not like much spice/more traditional flavors this is a better alternative. I personally think the prices were decent though the burritos are much smaller than Chipotle (for example) and the beans and guacamole are not put in the burrito directly.   The inside was nice and extremely spacious with nice service. The only reason for 3 stars is the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio was super busy and the staff are so cheerful.  I got the tostada and it was huge. It was the biggest tostada I have ever had.  The only thing that was difficult to get used to was the lettuce on top sometimes made me feel like I was eatting dandelions, but I'm sure thats the Taco Bell eater in me coming out. LOL. They even have a frequent eater card where you can earn free meals.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants fast but great mexican."}
{"text":"I love this Mexican fast food. The food is always fresh and full of flavors. My favorites are their barbacoa pork enchiladas with extra hot sauce. I love the Chipotle style serving counter, where the person prepares your mean in-font of you. The food tastes more authentic Mexican than any other fast food restaurant. Their enchilada style burritos are also delicious. If you have one near by than please feel free to try it out. Each container is about two servings, so there are left overs for next day."}
{"text":"Contrary to all other non-stellar reviews about Cafe Rio, I am a big fan of the franchise. This location is close to my home. Before we moved, our go-to and close to home location is the one on Stephanie and Warm Springs. That location is also good with a lot of energy from patrons and staff alike.  This location in Mission Hills or Horizon Ridge needs a bit more energy from the staff. Each tome I come in, there are a lot of people in line for take out. Majority of them are a group of family who want to bring their meal home. Some of them are athletes who finish training or a game. It's not dirty nor is the service not up to part. It just really needs a more enthusiastic staff.  I will not tell everyone to not go this location but instead, I will say give the a try."}
{"text":"This location is atrocious. The quality of the food was okay. The main problem is their customer service. Some of the workers acted as if they've never worked there before when putting together my food and others were rude and treated us like an inconvenience when we ordered, mind you, I did not give them any difficulty and was not picky with my order, they asked, I just told them an ingredient and yet they want to roll their eyes and pout. I'm not returning to this location, I gave them 2 stars because the food was decent. They need to restaff, these people honestly don't care."}
{"text":"I love the food,great price for the amount of food they serve.    What makes me not want to go there is the manager, Renzo. My neighbor's daughter quit and said others have quit due to the sexual harassment of this manager. He  was reported to the corporate office and she said nothing has happened. Does Cafe Rio allow this behavior? If so, I will not go back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, BUT It doesn't seem like they clean the place very well or very often.  Tables and seats always have food on them and the floor...(well, I don't think they EVER clean the floor)"}
{"text":"This location is a disaster ! Employees are always in a bad mood and have no customer service . I ordered food online for pick up to make it easy , not to mention I was picking up since I had to drive back to work . I got there and my order had not been done and they made me wait an additional 30 minutes. Management sucks and need better training.. Try learning from other locations."}
{"text":"People always tell me they are better than chipotle and in some ways they are. Other ways I feel like they are trying to make a buck off you for stupid things that are already free at chipotle. They charge extra for cheese, sour cream, mild sauce etc.  Seriously for what I get at chipotle I end up spending at least $5.00 more between my husband and I.      Though if this is the only \"Mexican\" restaurant nearby I suggest getting the Sweet Pork Barbacoa. Drink wise they offer a better selection since the have horchata, and limeades."}
{"text":"I dont see why ppl are giving not so great reviews. Today was my 1st time and let me tell you there was a long line but im pretty sure its one their rush hour! Nothing bad about that i understand. It was awesome seeing them make homemade tortillas. I absolutely love the food it was delicious. Service was great dealing with lots of customers can be hard but they take good care of you. Thanks guy will definitely be back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Freshly made tortillas! Sweet pork and the new spicy pork! Habanero sauce! This is now my lunchtime Taco Tuesday favorite."}
{"text":"I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up."}
{"text":"TANTAMOUNT TO FRAUD (Alert) DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE Avoid this place!  \"Fresh Atlantic Salmon.\" What does that mean to you?   Well, the so-called \"manager\" at the location I ate didn't know, herself, and did not speak good English.  They charged an expensive amount for their \"fresh Atlantic salmon\" taco plate, which (after further inquiry) is really farm raised to rake in more profit for their company.  They did not have a senior discount, either and I declined their $2.99 drink. This is not \"the real McCoy\" for what I wanted, but in my opinion fake food.  And like Judge Judy used to say, \"my opinion is the only one that counts.\""}
{"text":"Tried this cafe Rio as it opened last month. Let me start by saying my wife and I stopped by after a movie to give it a shot. The food is good, however The staff wanted to push certain proteins on us. The food is served in carry out plates, a big turn off for me. I ordered the steak enchiladas, not bad. My wife had the chicken quesadillas the food was good. The presentation and attitude of the staff left a lot to be desired. I was also over charged for My wife's chicken, I was charged for steak.  I bought this up to the manager And was told it was only a minimal amount, no apology.....I am not a cheap scape, but I believe I could of gotten better food at Eriberto's across the street. I will not be returning to this not so friendly Cafe.....The smell was not Exactly conducive to eating there.  My suggestion try it yourself...... You may like it, maybe not....."}
{"text":"I'm no expert when it comes to Mexican food, but I do eat out often and work in the hospitality industry. I enjoy eating here but the service has been very slow. Personally I think it's because of their \"Subway\" style of assembly line. There's no reason to have to speak to three different people for a to-go order.   The prices are high for fast food \"Mexican\". I don't think they want to be known as fast food, especially since it's somewhat slow and made to order, but there is an uneasy feeling when the warm meat portion of your entree is sitting on the vegetable line for a few minutes before the next employee is ready to ask you what you're having even though you already ordered. Seems monotonous.   Once my \"fire grilled steak\" sat for a couple of minutes, the next assembly line employee asked what I was having (even though I already ordered).  I realized the quickest option was to tell her, \"however it comes\". Still didn't matter as they were behind on orders.   I came to a third employee who asked what my order was. Apparently they work on the honor system. This gentleman seemed to be the only employee with a sense of urgency. He attempted to get caught up on multiple orders that were well behind the ticket time. No one else seemed to care or understand. I hope he gets promoted to management. They need it there.   3 stars for the average food. Would love to have it made to order as advertised.   4th star for the one person who understood urgency and hospitality."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and this place was slammed! The line to order was almost out the door. What a great sign to see coming to a restaurant for your first time. I ended up ordering the the Pork Barbacoa Burritto Enchilda style w/ guacomole. It was GIGANTIC!  The taste of my burrito was amazing sweet smokey and spicy! I will definitely be back to try some other dishs here."}
{"text":"This is the best cafe rio location in town! I've been to all of them depending on the side of town I'm running errands in and this is the only one that is consistently good. I visit this location once a week during the lunch rush and even though the line is always really long the staff does their best to keep the line running smoothly. The staff is always friendly and they always make my order just how I like it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Comparable to Chipotle's style of ordering, kinda.  Staff was friendly.  I'm sad I didn't get to try the freshly made tortillas; they looked REALLY good.    Tostada - not what I thought it would be.  Flat taco shell with salad on top.  Lime dressing/vinegarette was really good, though.  Nachos- I swear I saw him pile on the meat, but when we ate it, it seemed like there wasn't a lot?  Maybe the meat slices were thin.  I noticed that with the grilled chicken, they were cut pretty thin.    Next time, definitely quesedilla and tacos.  Drinks were awesome.  Half lemonade mint and half strawberry, like a strawberry mojito, minus the rum.  Overall, pretty solid."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Very affordable and quick. The staff was really friendly and helpful. The lady manager working on 10/6 could def go through a lot more customer service training. Just rude and blah.   She is def not a positive part of the place but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Prices have become a bit high at this chain, but you usually get enough food to fill you up for the day. The Monday special was the enchiladas with rice and beans. The price was $9.69, so it wasn't that special of a price, but the food was good at least. Try it Christmas style with both red and green sauces and it cost another buck to upgrade from shredded chicken to grilled chicken. The quesadilla also got good reviews. Oh yeah, If you happen to sit at the table where the air is blowing. your food will get cold faster."}
{"text":"Ok, so this used to be a good place. The last few times my wife and I went there, small portions, slow service, and the food didn't taste the same. I think they may have changed their recipes or something. Ugh....  I give this place 4 stars because it all depends on who serves you. I really like the food, it's good. I lived in California and grew up on authentic Mexican food. The only big issue, and it's the issue I have with most Mexican food restaurants is the rice. The rice is dry, instead of moist. It's a little bland as well. The pinto beans are fantastic though. The sweet pork is really good too. It's worth checking this place out, the service is usually fast enough, but watch out for Tuesday evenings, taco Tuesday's are always packed."}
{"text":"There's a reason that the three, two and one star reviews don't even amount to the four or five star reviews. I guess it just takes a certain kind of person to enjoy Cafe Rio for the amazing goodness that it is. I can taste the freshness of everything I've ever had from here, and really hope they open up more locations when I move out of town!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican chain ever! Tortillas are ridiculously amazing. The steak is the best, so much better than chipotle. I've just learned about this place three weeks ago and I've already been here about 10 times. Plus they give rewards! I'm a fan! The only downside, that last 4 times I've been they were out of steak. Yes it was about 7-8pm each time, but I feel like if you keep running out you should have more made. Especially if there's so much of the other meats left at that same time. Which there always is!"}
{"text":"Fresh tortilla! And they are good! Came here and to another location near Summerlin, liked this location better for some reason, don't know why the food tasted a little different at the Summerlin location.   FOOD Like a Chipotle but with a fresh tortilla. That's what makes it. The chicken was also really juicy. Didn't try the other meats though.   Chicken tacos (4 stars): They put a good amount of chicken in there. You can taste the tortilla more since it's not covered with ingredients.   Chicken salad (4 stars): They put a fresh tortilla on the bottom. Comes with guacamole too. Only thing is the tortilla on the bottom is soggy from everything on top, so ask for it on the side if you want. House dressing is good!  SERVICE Everyone was nice when I came here. They are pretty fast at orders.  ATMOSPHERE Came for lunch and it was pretty packed, but people get up fast. There are a good amount of tables."}
{"text":"I went to get a salad tonight which consisted of a tortilla, grilled chicken which I asked for extra due I did not want the rice or beans. They put lettuce tortilla strips dressing and a drink $15.58. Never will eat here again. I could go and get a great meal for 15.00$$$$"}
{"text":"I used to love the queso. I think I can do better with a jar of tostitos cheese. It just isn't worth coming here. The noise level is astronomical,  with all the screaming rugrats on top of the kitchen noise, phone ringing incessantly, and horrendous music. The line is long. The prices are high. There was no cheese in my burrito, yet I had to spend an extra dollar for cheese on top. Plus the extra dollar for the stringy steak. Can't stand any of the salsas or pico...very tomato-y with no other flavors. Chipotle is better, and that says a lot. Oh, and they use the evil evil styrofoam."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here,  have gone plenty of times. Staff is always friendly,  service is always fast. Their chicken is amazing & the quesadillas are the bomb. They do offer a stamp card,  where you get a free item after 10 visits."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is my new addiction. The food is delicious and affordable.  The pork is to die for.  Whether its the pork salad or pork tacos.  This location has outside seating option which is GREAT for days when the weather is nice.  The drink selections are AMAZING! Mint Limeade FAN.     Be sure to get your loyalty punch card so that you can get a free meal after 10 purchases. :-)"}
{"text":"Every time we go into this location we wait 20-30 mins !! Every single time !!!   Food is always good that's why we keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Go hungry.  The massive quantities of food will keep Americans overindulging and obese."}
{"text":"Not as busy as their other locations and their military discount is awesome. The whole staff is always smiling and enthusiastic. And they are never stingy with the portion."}
{"text":"This location is filthy! The sneeze guard had spit and whatever on it right at eye level...yuck! The employees are rude and pushy, it wasn't even busy. The whole restaurant was dirty and when I went to get a soda, the machine had fruit flies flying around the ice tray. The health department should definitely give this place a visit!"}
{"text":"I always try to give this place a try, people rave about it, but it's always mediocre to me. My food is always cold and soggy. Who likes a soggy burrito? Not me..."}
{"text":"I came in very excited and it was my first time at this location. Every other location has been excellent. I don't know if it was just the employees working today or if it was the restaurant as a whole. But this has been by far the worst experience. I have never seen such lack of customer service in my life. First of all it was very very messy and sloppy. The first employee in the line was slopping everything into the bowl. I specifically asked for half and half beans in my salad and she proceeded to ignore and only give me pinto. Then the second employee in the line disregarded the fact that I asked for red salsa and she decided to put green instead. I then, told her that I asked for red not green and she said \"oh sorry\" and didn't even offer to remake it. When I asked for cheese i pointed to the yellow shredded cheese but she put the crumbled cheese instead. Which might I add, was on the complete other side of what I pointed to. Then finally when I asked for queso I had to ask her multiple times to put more. I would be completely fine with paying extra for a little more queso. The employees were rude by ignoring my requests and acting bothered by them. I am not one for confrontation and know that they are young and are gonna mess up, but this was just too much. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The first couple times I went I had no problems but this last time I went (11/30/16) was far from great.   It started when I ordered with the Cafe Rio app and they \"didn't receive the order\" but I didn't find that out until AFTER I paid for the order that had been called in by someone else. The order was similar to mine but there were some differences (regular quesadilla instead of the free Nino quesadilla). When I tried to tell them that the order was wrong they told me \"well, that's what you ordered so that's what we made\". After I paid and got the receipt I noticed that the name and phone number on the top of the receipt was not mine. I mentioned that to the employee and she, and who I'm guessing was the manager, was reluctant to give me a refund. When I finally got the refund they told me that I needed to get in line and order my food again, which I did. When I got to the end of the line I was still trying to be as nice and respectful as I could but it appeared like I was \"inconveniencing\" them. I took my drink cup and went over to the soda fountain and I could smell the dirty bathroom! With how bad it smelled I can't even imagine what they looked like!   When I got the food home I ate half of my salad (which the meat wasn't even close to how flavorful it usually is) and saved the rest for later. When I got around to eating the rest of my salad, I felt something in my mouth that was very crunchy. Knowing that I had eaten all of the lettuce and chips earlier I started to get a little worried. When I spit the object out of my mouth I almost threw up. IT WAS A BUG! I was too disgusted and angry about the lack of customer service that I didn't even want to call and have them try to tell me that it was somehow my fault.   DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! I am not the type of person who writes bad reviews for places but this one was HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Rio's food. Ive been eating it for over 7 years. At one point in my life I was eating Café Rio at least once a week. Since this location was built, I go about once or twice a month. I was very surprised to see that this location has such bad reviews. However after going here several times now, I understand. Most of the reviews are about the service, and not the food. And I will have to agree that this is the slowest Café Rio I have ever been to. Ever. The food is still good, however taking 40 minutes to get through a line to get my food is just too painful.  Because I love the food, I will still continue to come here. And in my opinion Café Rio is definitely a 5 Star food place. But until the service improves at this location I have to be honest and only give it three stars.  Recommendation for new comers?  Pork Barbacoa burrito. White rice. Black beans. Cheese inside.  And enchilada style with mild (green) sauce inside and on top.   UPDATE: I actually tried convincing my wife to go to Rubios tonight because of the line at this place. It is painfully slow.  Ive gotta take this down to 2 stars. Its just unacceptable for it to take this long to get food. Ive been in line for 5 minutes, and I havent moved."}
{"text":"Customer service needs a LOT of improvement. None of my 3 visits has gone right. Stingy portion of meat, order mixed up w/ another customer, and spoiled guac. Not returning anymore."}
{"text":"My daughter loves the salad but we are not going to bring her to get it any more. Every single time I bring her we are rushed in line and receive the WORST customer service. I am also gluten sensitive and when I asked for gluten free options no options were available. I was told that maybe the grilled chicken is ok... just not good enough. Fail on customer service. Fail on gluten free."}
{"text":"I wish this Cafe Rio was better than the others one's I go to. Every time I visit, something goes wrong. At times they'll be out of steak, and never really ask if I'd like to wait for the next batch. Other places do ask if I'd like to wait. Other times, the beans are undercooked, or the tortillas are hard. It's just another place full of high school workers who don't care. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"The people must honestly hate their job at this location, they are less than friendly. When we asked for a large thing of dressing (to purchase) the gal let out a big sigh, and didn't even get it.. took 4 times asking for it for someone to initiate getting it. Not one person behind the counter was friendly. Such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Always tasty but only reason for no 5 stars is because they have the slowest line of any cafe rio I have every been to. Delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio salads are my favorite go to, when I'm craving a burrito, but also want that fresh salad. I have come to this establishment quite a few times, and have had different levels of service, but overall everyone is nice. One thing that I love about Cafe Rio is that their food is always fresh! I have never had an issue with wilted or brown lettuce here.  They are very consistent and that's really important to me! The sweet barbacoa pork is my most favorite protein, very tender and satisfying. The house dressing is on the spicy side, it has a bit of kick to it and it's a must! They will accommodate what ever you like, so don't be afraid to add or minus an ingredient. I'm definitely a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Over all it was great, clean, and organized, I had the Cancun shrimp tacos yummmmmie!! I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is because the rice was undercooked and super crunchy. I will be back for sure.."}
{"text":"This is the third time that we used online ordering and the second time the order was incorrect. Ordered a Hatch Chile Chicken burrito with double Pintos. What I got was a Chicken burrito with tons of rice, I really don't like rice. My wife's burrito also had no Pintos and very little meat. Did they just blow the order or do they not have any Pintos? Communication is the key. The first time  our order was incorrect they took it upon themselves to substitute black beans for Pintos. Adios Cafe Rio...."}
{"text":"Don't bother calling in your order! When I got here, they didn't know the order was placed! They didn't even start making it untill we get here!!! This is the third time they've done this to me. Watched the whole line go through, while waiting on two meals :/"}
{"text":"I love everything about this made in front of you, just like you want it, fresh, delicious food. Their sweet pork is to die for...I get it on absolutely everything. I've tried just about everything on the menu and you can't go wrong in any choice you make. Definitely a restaurant worth a visit. I go here multiple times a week and it has yet to get old  I have never had bad food or bad service. The quacamoli is amazing too...get some. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Still over rated.  Cafe Rio is a crumby version of all of your local Hispanic and South American foods, crammed into one bland menu.  I was asked to stop here on my way to an event. Upon trying to order for a couple people, I learned that there is no flexibility in the items. You can take what they offer in only certain arrangements, otherwise, everything is full price and cannot be made with other toppings.   They got the order wrong twice, then looked at me like I had 3 heads and a tail when I told them that I did not want chips, beans, and rice with the meal.   All that stress for drastically over priced, low quality food. Totally not worth is.  Near ANY Cafe Rio in town, you will find a Roberto's or other spot for tacos, burritos and nachos... so skip this garbage and at least go to a place where the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This location is a major bummer! The service was very slow.. I'm talking a 10 minute wait while the one person in front of me ordered 3 items.  No \"We'll be right with you\" or \"just a moment, look over the menu\", no nothing.  When the server was preparing my food the other woman working with her had to tell her a few times that she needed to change the gloves she had on.  Glad she was there.  The kicker was they were out of pico, you're a Mexican restaurant, you gotta have pico.  Not that I would have not placed an order, but it was odd that it wasn't even mentioned until I got to the adding sauces portion of placing my order.  There were multiple people working and they were still open for several more hours, so it didn't make a lot of sense.  I also noticed that many of the drink machines were empty as well, enough so that when I left I thought I snuck in 5 minutes before closing, but there was still 3+ hours of being open."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio.  The tortillas are made right there and are YUMMY.  I always get the Queso and chips because it is phenomenal !  I love the chicken tacos, burritos and salads ."}
{"text":"Caution: ordering tortilla soup \"incorrectly\" will get you bitched at here.  I added a tortilla soup to my order, and the girl who has the easiest job on the assembly line copped major attitude. She popped her hand to her hip and asked if I'd ordered it at the front of the line- nope, because they didn't ask. \"You're SUPPOSED to order it at the FRONT of the line!\", she barked at me before dramatically rolling her eyes, glaring at me, and getting it herself.   After dealing with the sassy pint-size brat, I was a bit more critical of the food. Salmon burrito, $10, overpriced and under-seasoned, large portion is soggy and bland. I'd intended to eat this for lunch and dinner, but tossed it halfway through.  Best purchase was the tortilla soup I suffered for, which came with crispy tortilla strips, fresh cilantro, and lime for garnish, was packed with tons of veggies, avocado, and cheese, and served with a  tortilla to make it a meal for just shy of $5. I'll take mine sans attitude next time.  EDIT: Dropping a star. I've been back 2 more times and the line has been insanely slow all times, and there's always a major issue with my order. On the plus side, after you point out their error, they usually remake it correctly and give you both. But there's a ton of eye rolling and/or excuses before that happens."}
{"text":"The service I received wasn't that great!! I had asked for salsa on my food and I got completely ignored the food is good but I wish they would just take a little more time to actually listen to what I wanted."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with freshly made tortillas. Great service & easy parking. Friendly staff. Delicious juices with free refills. Tasty salsa for those fresh, still warm Chips. Chicken was wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the place was filthy. All trash receptacles were full...gross! No clean tables because people couldn't throw their trash away, so they left it on the table!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Cafe Rio and have had overall good service and food at the locations i've been to, EXCEPT THIS ONE! I have tried this location 2x and both times my food has been cold, the restaurant its self is dirty, and you can tell the staff doesn't want to be there. I ordered a sweet pork quesadilla today for lunch, straight forward nothing else added and yet it was almost inedible because the pork was  so dry and the cheese was cold and hard. AND it was put on a wheat tortilla, if i'm going to Cafe Rio i'm not looking to cut calories-eww. Will not go back and will stick with the Chandler Blvd and the Gilbert mall locations."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and the prices are comparable... Staff is polite and efficient... We visit frequently."}
{"text":"One word sums up this place. Barf! I went in here for the first time during lunch hour and it was packed. The line took 25 minutes. Everything about this place is sloppy. The way the cook was working over the grill, the food area...all sloppy. I would have left but I had been line for 20 minutes already so I figured I would tough it out. The employees are grumpy and make you feel like they are doing YOU a favor. The food was bland. My plate was all smushed together and not attractive at all.  Oh! And the bonus you get when you eat here is severe sickness. I was nauseous and crampy the whole damn day. BARF!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when we walked in. Wanted to try the new habanero hatch chile. So I got a sample barbacoa pork it was freaking SWEET like sweet in low.  So we got the chicken with spicy green chile sauce why was it SWEET YUCK!  1st and last time here!"}
{"text":"At Christmas time they had the pulled pork Tamalie's and OMG Loved them. But when we went this time they did not have them any more.  They did not have the rice ready when we got there and we got there when they opened 10:30am.. So I got the pork Nachos and my Husband wanted a Bean and Cheese burrito with rice and ended up with just the Bean and Cheese. But the food was very good. The staff seemed ok kinda talking amongst each other but, they did aknowledge us also. We will be back"}
{"text":"Did not meet my expectations at all. The burrito is shown with red sauce they put green. Also the order was online and when i showed up at the specified time the food wasnt ready. I waited 15 minutes"}
{"text":"The sweet pork quesadilla is yummy. My boyfriend really enjoyed his flame-grilled steak burrito. It's nice to have choices like horchata, mint limeade, sugar-free strawberry lemonade, and flavored iced teas, in addition to the standard sodas.  They also have a good variety of hot sauces and a convenience station with plenty of quality napkins, lids for your leftovers, cutlery, etc. (The portions are large.)  We went on a \"grand opening\" sort of day when they gave away 150 free meals; so I expected to wait a long time. Nope! The service was fast, friendly, and efficient. If this is how they treat you when you give them no money, I'm definitely returning! :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio needs to find their groove. The food was tasty, yes. Seemed like quality ingredients, yet the food was ice cold (which is odd since its run under the broiler). The staff seemed friendly, yet had absolutely NO sense of urgency. During the dinner rush on a weekday each smiling staff member just kinda stood around as if waiting for a leader to take charge."}
{"text":"Place was cute, kinda reminded me of Chipotle in California but this place seems to always be crowded. They have different options for main meal like burritos with or without enchiladas style, tacos, enchiladas, tostadas or taco salads.  All the meat fillings are tasty,hubby order the chile beef, I got the New habanero pork burritos and there are sides to choose from with extra cost. We both got one drink to share which has unlimited refills and the mint lemonade is the bomb however it was too sweet but if you get plenty iced, it will melt nicely and on hot days , it sure hit the spot. Total for two burritos and a drink come out to be around 25-26$ which I guess not bad considering it is in Vegas They have desert here too like flans, key limes pie that I will def try next time"}
{"text":"Excellent food which they always run out of at some point.  It is just not worth going there and waiting in line then find out they don't have your favorite thing on the menu again. Management does not care about guest happiness or satisfaction. I would trade a higher price for some consistency in this lost restaurant any day."}
{"text":"Got here 10 minutes before closing tonight with a plan to do carry out, but the doors were locked.   When a place says on their website and doors that they close at a certain time they should stay open until that time.  Guess maybe the employees wanted to cut out early."}
{"text":"Prices are good. Food is awesome.. The wait is not that long! I love their salads from back when I would go to St George for one! My favorite is the pork salad, but I have recently discovered the Salmon Salad- it's amazing!! Got to get your frequent card- free meal!! Love Mint Limeade and Strawberry Lemonade."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick bit to eat, if you like Chipotle you will love Cafe Rio. It has a great deal more variety. The best part is the drinks. Mint Limeade is awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very surprised how long the line was, but it moved quickly. It's similar to Chipotle or Qdoba except they have more people working and more fish items.   I got the 2 taco meal with barbacoa for the meat. Very different from barbacoa I've had at other places. It was sweet and kind of sugary. I really liked it and would get it again. The tacos come with lettuce, cilantro and pico de gallo with a side of rice and beans.   They rush you through the line a little. They didn't offer cheese or sour cream, just asked if I wanted lettuce and pico. Probably a good thing though because I would've added those at it wouldn't have worked with the taste of the meat."}
{"text":"Yeah the food was 'OK', nothing too special but still good.  I ordered a burrito enchilada style.  I thought the sauce was really good, but the burrito itself wasn't great.  The burrito simply doesn't have enough meat in it, or enough variety of fillers.  I prefer something like the nacho burrito from Baja Fresh which has all sorts of good things in the burrito as well as enough meat.  A lot of people seem to love this place b/c it's always jam packed, but I don't see why it's considered so much better than anywhere else that sells the same types of food.  Service was pretty good, and despite the long line the wait isn't bad because the line moves quickly.  The inside can get crowded though."}
{"text":"Customer Service : There is something about the people that work here that make me not want to come here. They make it seem like customers are annoying when asked a question. The first time I went here the girl was getting annoyed because I did not know what anything came with(even though I explained that I had never been there). I gave it another chance and it's the same thing. They just start putting stuff on there and when my friend asked for shredded lettuce instead, the woman rolled her eyes.  Food: The food is delicious.  I have only tried the chicken burrito and chicken salad and both are wonderful. There are plenty of choices to customize it but still very yummy. It has different taste profiles than other similar restaurants like chipotle. The portions are large for the price and the food is still yummy if finished later in the day.  The environment: The actual restaurant is interesting to look at and offers plenty of seating indoor and outdoor."}
{"text":"Vegetarians and Vegans beware:  Cafe Rio @lakepleasent is not too friendly for Vegetarian or Vegan choices or I had bad luck my first time there.  Al dente is synonymous with pasta however does not bode well with rice or beans maybe this is the new norm for Cafe Rio but not this palate. As for the vegetarian option its only rice and beans, boring, if you choose a sauce you are only allowed the green chile sauce, I guess red chile is for meat eaters. Even though your offered double servings of rice and beans, that's it, no peppers, onions or any other vegetarian/vegan options. I gave one star for the made fresh tortillas! After that the burrito began to fall short."}
{"text":"Used to love this location but their recent new employees have really been bad and filled with bad attitude and no enthusiasm. Went in to get a veggie burrito (no meat) as I always get and Fey was the one taking my order at first I waited so long because she was behind on orders so then when she got to me she barely put rice and added double the beans on my burrito without asking me. This has never happened to me before ever! At any location so I immediately told her can you please not put so much beans and just even if out since there's barely any rice and she was so mad and looked at me like really b****. She said \"well my bad damn didn't you ask for no meat??\" And I said yes but I never asked for you to triple load the beans on it! Never had that issue and she got really mad and took the beans back out and barely left anything in my burrito so I was like ok I'm not dealing with this so I keep my mouth shut and she gives it to the next person and the other girl starts to put lettuce and pick without asking me so I had to tell her as well... like seriously? This place really needs to hire people who care about their customers and not give nasty attitude or stares. Makes me not want to come to this place anymore sadly!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The first visit was ok. However, today was just non plus.  If we could give zero star, we would. This is for very rude service by ANNA, and overcharging.  We ordered burritos with no cheese. Anna was very rude when I reminded her we ordered our burritos without cheese. She also condescendingly reminded us that \"All burritos comes with cheese inside, and that YOU need to tell me no cheese!\" I explained to her that we did infact ordered the Burritos without cheese prior to her adding cheese to our orders. And we reminded her again as she dropped a handful of cheese on the burritos. She then rolled her eyes unapologetically, and moved on without asking what do we want with our Burritos.  With that being said, I asked the cashier to please put pico, lettuce, cilantro, and guacamole with our order because ANNA is not interested in providing us decent customer service. The cashier apologised, and the cashier asked ANNA to help us out. She then told the cashier to charge us for asking for some lettuce and pico as it was a side salad. WTF?! Sincerely?  We did not order a side salad. We simply would like the garnishings that she did not want to add on our burritos. My mates and myself at this point have had it with her deplorable attitude. So, instead of stooping to her very poor attitude, we decided to pay the over-charge, and leave.  We also work in a service industry. Anna's rudeness to customers, and retaliation by over-charging us is simply unacceptable! If she cannot provide decent customer service to church goers like us, perhaps she needs to find a position who tolerates her rudeness., and away from public service. She sincerely is giving us service workers a very bad reputation!  The food was on the salty side for us, but with a little lemon/lime it was good. ^_^ The price was average to slightly pricey. The amount of food was a bit on the skimpy side for the price they charge.  Given our recent experience with Cafe Rio, we are not returning here again ... unless  there is a Zombie apocalypse! *lol*  Xx"}
{"text":"I went into this Cafe Rio location to just get some tacos, and I was amazed by how well there shift was going ! the manager was bomb ! He had an awesome attitude, he was socializing with his customers and encouraging his associates ! Everything was running really smooth and they were killing it ! Great job guys !!"}
{"text":"We've came here a few times for both take-out and dine-in.. this place is usually bustling, so I guess that's a good sign. I usually the classic chicken or steak burrito, good-sized, and yummy. ($9).. but no beans or rice on the side. Those cost extra. No bueno.  The side salad is a joke.. it's shredded lettuce and cheese with little bits of tomato and tortilla chips on top. Wow, underwhelmingly cheap looking and the feeling of ripped off sets in when you take one look.  The downsides:  Somewhat overpriced.. and they nickel and dime ya. The sides such as sour cream, guacamole, cheese etc. are charged extra. ($1 each).  The good sides: Food is pretty fresh and tasty, don't know about authentic, but would say the quality beats a lot of other Mexican restaurants.  Average place = average score."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio greater than Chipotle  That's really all you need to know right? In the battle for the best burrito place in Vegas Cafe Rio is the big cheese- and that's because they actually have QUESO. Creamy, delicious, liquid cheese will fix just about any problem a restaurant has. Here is a short guide to Cafe Rio  1. Get a burrito- yes they have other things, the other things are not as good as the burrito.  2. Sauce spicyness +1 - the sauces are all extremely mild so whatever level of spice you would usually get you probably want to kick it up a notch  3. Enchilada style- this is where they douse your burrito in sauce and cheese before toasting it. Essential.   4. Acceptable meats in order: pork, steak... thats it. They have shrimp and chicken but they are nowhere near as good so best to avoid  5. Chips and Queso- this ties the meal together. The chips are actually pretty decent and while the queso isn't white (the holy grail of cheese dips is white queso with jalapenos) it is still by far the best option in town.    A negative reviewer laments that they put guac outside the burrito... well if you ask them to put it inside they do, not sure Cafe Rio should be punished for people not knowing how to order food."}
{"text":"I've never had Cafe Rio before and I was looking forward to finally trying it out after hearing great things about it. I excitedly made my way from my car to the front of the store, and once I had opened the door I was disappointed. It was empty, the food laid out looked gross and old.  No one greeted me out of the 6 or so people that were there... I had to wait and stand there a few minutes before someone came to help me. I ordered a salad with salmon... hoping the food tasted better than it looked. I was disappointed. I will never be back again. I'd rather have Chipotle or Zabas. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I took my 2 yr old son with me to grab some food to go today. My son loved saying hi to all the workers. Who were kinda friendly.  Got 1 sweet pork / 1 coconut shrimp tacos w / rice & Black/pinto beans. I always ask for half & half .   Coconut shrimp taco isn't my thing. It's filled with a few shrimp & heavy on \" toasted coconut \"  Sweet pork was ok. Seemed a little dry / maybe say I. Yeh warming pans too long.  The cilantro was like all stems . I hate the stems too stringy for me. However I'm a huge cilantro fan so this was a bummer.  Rice is super dry.  As well as the black & pinto beans    Got a sweet pork burrito for my husband at home as well.   Pork was dry & had over cooked / old pork  in it . Some of it was still edible :   & a free ninjo quesadilla. Kids 6& under  My kid loves his Nino quesadilla:)  & was amazed by the horchata drink I originally got for my husband who loves this drink from cafe Rio.    Unfortunately my husband wasn't a fan for the first time. He said it tasted extremely watered down. He loves it normally it's very very sweet.   We enjoy costa vida more . We crave costa visa every so often & since moving to Las Vegas NV. from Southern Utah  we settle for cafe Rio.    This time unfortunately was a big disappointment.    We Signed up for the app & got $5 off .  So all in all we saved a good little chunk of $.  Nothing bad enough to make a complaint about. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"I've really put off reviewing Cafe Rio because I used to love this place. It used to be SO good. Then something happened. I've given it so many chances, thinking THIS time it will be good again. Nope. Every time I get the pork salad now, the tortilla is stale. The pork has a different flavor every time I go. The last time I went (this week) it was so spicy I stopped eating it. I'm sad to say It's just not good anymore. I give up!"}
{"text":"So I did a call in order for my co workers and I, it was s  supposed to be ready around 11:45 and it wasn't. Then one of my coworkers went to pick it up and they said they coundt split the order to pay because they were to busy too, but when I called she said we could when we picked up. That isn't right."}
{"text":"Similar to a chipotle, but with more options.  Only negative was the staff at this location. There seemed to be two new people on the line doing almost nothing. I don't blame them if they don't know what to do...anyhow, manager sorted it and service began moving.  The enchilada didn't come with red sauce standard and the Taco salad was a lightly grilled tortilla. I prefer the crunchy shells myself, so I saved the carbs this time and just ate the innards.  Best part?: TRES LECHES!! This was so delicious! I ordered it expecting it to be a disappointment, dry and chalky like other fast restaurants. Nope, this was amazing!  Also, kids under 6 get \"Niño quesadillas\" free. How awesome is that?!  I would definitely return here. Hope the staff is better trained next time."}
{"text":"Wow, this is way better than chipotle and I love how they have daily specials minus Sundays.  Food has better quality based on the salads I've received not to mention their portion is better sizing than chipotle.  They also have a great soda station including 3 different teas along with special beverages like horchata.  You can get creative with the flavor pumps to add to your soda with selections like pomegranate.  They have a cornucopia of hot sauces too.  For $5.75, you can get a tostada salad with either pork barbocoa or pulled chicken or on wednesdays, throw in a drink as a combo with the chicken for $.50 more...you can't beat that."}
{"text":"As fun as it is to have a Cafe Rio so close to home, I have to say this is the 2nd worst location I've visited. The store in Tempe on University is a total abomination, but sadly this one isn't much better. The prep line is slow and sloppy. They could use some more time with the pros from stores in our neighboring state to the north. Fingers crossed they sort things out. Rio can be really, really good when they're running a tight ship."}
{"text":"Pork burrito enchilada style is very good but it is huge and you are guaranteed to eat 2000+ calories in one sitting.  Great tasting food though."}
{"text":"The food is off the chain, it just has this different flavor to me, the enchilada sauce is a slightly sweet, with a spicy kick flavor to it. The enchiladas are meaty and good size, along with a healthy portion of rice and beans you can't go wrong. The rice isn't anything out of this world, but rice rarely is to me, however it is not bad by any means. I've had both the steak and chicken enchiladas, and last night they put together a special request of grilled salmon enchiladas for me that were equally as spectacular. Try the green house dressing for a $1, a spicy cucumber like sauce goes excellent over the enchiladas for added flavor!"}
{"text":"Never had I tried this place. Disappointed and upset. This place is ok to try once but that's it. Too expensive and the only thing worth the money was the freshly made flour tortillas. Everything else was ok. The horchata was the worst I tried. The employees were in a hurry. Maybe I shouldn't have gone at lunchtime; but still they shouldn't rush you asking what ingredients you want. To top it off; once I picked my ingredients, the girl assisting seemed bothered and the guy next to her did too, and then proceeded to pretty much throw our picked items on the aluminum container. I had a tostada which was horrible. Who ever eats a soggy tostada? They obviously don't know how to prepare one. Very basic and really I'm the \"smart one\" for even spending my money there. I do not recommend this place. Oooh one more thing...... the cashier didn't even ask if we wanted a combo and charged us for it saying it's cheaper. I get it if he would've asked me first not just assumed I wanted it and charged me for it. I couldn't really have anything other than water on this day but that's why I tried the horchata and as I thought..... GROSS!!!!  If you're like me and know how to cook, don't waste your money in places like this. Total rip off."}
{"text":"I like the food but this place is poorly run.  It is one of the slowest run food restaurants I've been at.  All three times I've been here it has taken forever.  Not to mention I ordered ahead by 45 min and they were still 30 minutes late.  This place needs serious work on their speed as staffing."}
{"text":"The food actually tastes authentic, which was a huge surprise. Pretty big line but Prices are decent. But beware, once you start adding things on the side like guacamole or sour cream or beans the total price was a little overpriced. Overall amazing food, friendly staff (ask for extra cheese, you're welcome lol) and the place was clean. Will be going again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location. Not only are employees rude, employees always seem to not know what they are doing. On 9/11 I went to have dinner with my husband, and they had no tortillas, they tried to make some and they burn them,  it took 30 minutes just to get my order, which was 1 burrito. They gave wrong orders to the people in front of me and  then blamed the client for their mistake. A lot of unhappy clients that night. Please Cafe Rio, train your employees better, such a great location but bad attitudes all around."}
{"text":"The red chicken enchiladas are excellent as well as the chips and salsa. I highly recommend you try the mint lime aid for your beverage. The dinning experience is casual but I highly recommend."}
{"text":"WHY DO THE EMPLOYEES WEAR GLOVES?  Um, one would think that the gloves they wear, might make it so that they don't contaminate the food they handle! WRONG! The gloves don't matter, when the girl that took our order today, started preparing our food, handling the tortilla and cheese, after rubbing her hands (in gloves) off of her Nose, then wiped it off on the back seat of her dirty Jeans! Then, the Next Girl used a dish rag to wipe of the counter (where the lettuce and rice are), used the same dirty gloves hands to handle the lettuce! My wife even asked her (straight up) about that and she admitted it, then still sent the tins down the line.  We were disqusted, should have just left, but we paid and then just threw out the nasty food!  Also, before today, I already wanted to mention that the last three times we went there, the Rice was hard, completely under-cooked... beans too! I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY I RETURNED AGAIN ANYWAYS! Incompetant staff of Teen-agers, wow, should we be so shocked?!   Also, as an added tid-bit to show how poorly run this crappy place is... please see my photo of the mystery drinks and especially enjoy the hygenic aluminum covered one! WTF? The management needs to be fired, along with all of the Nasty, filthy gloved, little teen-aged Girls!   This is the truth... eat E coli, AT YOUR OWN RISK!  THEY NEED TO START OVER!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice. Both times the food was extremely salty. The guacamole, black beans & spicy ranch dressing were especially salty. We informed the manager & his response was he tasted everything & he didn't think it was salty!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go... When I arrived I went to  the pick up cashier and said hello ...and was completely ignored. When the other online pick up customers arrived, they were neglected as well... When I finally got my food I asked for salsa - she replied \"it's already in there\"  When I got back to my house--- the order was wrong and the salsa wasn't in there."}
{"text":"I usually get a salad but I tried their nachos today and they were awesome! They put down a layer of chips, meat, cheese, and quest and top it with guacamole, lettuce, and pico. Not very healthy but they were so good! Everything else was great but this location seems to have a longer wait time than most of the other Cafe Rios in the Valley."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, but not this location. There is a girl at this location that has messed up my order three times! Seriously, just listen and stop talking to your coworkers! There is only two nice employees but there but this one employee is just completely idiotic!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. It's great. But the food can be expensive. Like another reviewer stated by the time you get all the sides (guacamole, sour cream, salad, etc) you are definitely looking at a $12 burrito. But despite my griping about the price I keep going back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Cafe Rio for a couple of years now and enjoy it. Recently I moved to the area and started going to this location. Over the past two weeks I have probably eaten there three times. Not once have I got good service. Two out of three times I ordered online figured out give them time to make it and have it ready for me when I got there. But both times they never started making it until I got there so I had to wait. What's the point of online ordering when you have to stand there and wait in line like everyone else. The first time we went to this location they made our food and we watched them try and give it to two different people before we got it.   From now on I'll be driving to the Centennial location even though this location is a block and a half from my house. My only thought is they have the worst management ever at this location.   I only gave them one star because you can have the best food in the world but when your staff is crap why bother."}
{"text":"ORDER ONLINE!! That has to be thee best thing ever created!! I ordered 6 entrees for tonights dinner and i paid online.. as i entered the place, i skipped the long line of people, and had my order ready and when i got home eveything was made fresh, hot and extra seasoned. Delicious! Whoever made the creamy tomatillo dressing mann props to you it was amazing! Will continue to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Oh cafe rio, what happened! Went for dinner last night and the experience was not like usual. There's a lady sweeping and cleaning the hoods in the middle of service!!!!right around all of the open food. Then there's the trash, all full and overflowing then there's a table of like 8 staff all casually chowing down. Then the food when did the get so tight on giving guac we got about a teaspoon! Don't they have a manager??"}
{"text":"Being a that this is a new location I have held this review hoping service would get better. Unfortunately it hasn't! This is the fifth time I have come to this location, and each time I have had horrible customer service!!! And the food leaves something to be desired. The last time I ate here, I spoke to the manager who claims his hands are tied because after numerous complaints, corporate will not let him discipline or fire the problem employees.  This concerns me greatly, if disgruntled employees are allowed to continue serving food, there's a pretty good chance they are doing something disgusting to mine! I will never be back!  I feel that this town is plagued with entitled people who care little about customer service! hopefully out reviews will change that!"}
{"text":"Maybe the mistake I made was going here for the first time around 8pm. I ordered the chicken tacos. The food line looked like it hadn't been refreshed since the dinner rush. Lots of empty spots and food all over.  I asked what I can get on the tacos everything I was offered was either gone or had a layer of crust. The guacamole had a nice layer of brown over it. I asked for black bean and again there was barely any and what was there looked extremely old. But they went ahead and scoop the1/4 scoop into may bowl and then charged me for a full side order without telling me beans were extra.   Next time I'll just head across the street to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The soda is always flat and the employees have a f you attitude. Definitely wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone. What a waste."}
{"text":"I had a shredded chicken burrito, pinto beans, rice.. Smothered with green sauce & cheese. Lettuce & pico on the side. Paid way too much extra for the drop of sour cream and guacamole.  Customer service sucks pretty much. If your new to the restaurant like I was, not a great first experience. HOWEVER the food was great which is why I gave 4 stars"}
{"text":"The worst Cafe Rio I have been to.  This past Sunday, out of fajita chicken and beef at 5:00 P.M.    The staff did not appear to be very engaged.  Almost like they were picked from a reality show and made to work at a random location.    Close to my house, but underwhelming."}
{"text":"I decided on one of my favs, Cafe Rio. I had a huge chicken burrito, enchilada style. Everything was fresh and pretty tasty. I did have to ask for a little more cheese, but the girl that created my masterpiece happily obliged.  I had some change that I wanted to get rid of and asked the cashier if I could use a roll of dimes I had from my change drawer at work. This girl broke it open and started counting it as if it didn't already say $5 on roll. She clearly doesn't attend ULVN...a sweetheart nevertheless. Lol"}
{"text":"This is still the best quick Mexican food around also has some menu items that are fairly healthy. And I love the drinks!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Way better than Chipotle!!! Better quality food, larger proportions and really delicious drinks."}
{"text":"Great food... portion are too big but I thought everything g tasted fresh. The tortillas were incredible!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to Yelp about this place for a long time! This small Mexican fast food restaurant gives you the quality of a gourmet Mexican restaurant for the price of fast food. Their daily specials are always very very good. When not getting the daily special (my favorite is the Chile Relleno's), I usually get the Pork Salad with extra meat. The staff are all required to yell out EXTRA MEAT or EXTRA CHEESE when a customer orders them. Lol. Btw their burrito's are huge!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ever since I came to Cafe Rio, I never went back to Chipotle. This place is really good. It is just like Chipotle where you go down the row and pick what you want in your meal. They have burritos, tostadas, tacos, quesidillas and more. There are multiple different meats but I would recommend getting the sweet pork. The options inside the burrito are beans, rice, sauce, cheese and meat. You can also get the sauce and cheese on the top too. On the side it comes with lettuce and salsa (tomatoes). If you want sour cream, then you have to pay extra. For one meal it's about $9, but it is definitely a big size so it is worth it. The drinks that they have are the regular sodas, lemonade, horchata and tea.  This location is at the corner of the shopping center near Baseline and Gilbert Road. There are a bunch of tables inside, big enough for a big group. You can also take your food to-go. The staff was nice, but I do think they need an extra worker because the line goes kind of slow. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week and I thought it was pretty good. It is like Chipotle where you walk down in a line and pick out what you want in your burrito, taco, quesidilla, etc. I thought Cafe Rio had a more authentic Mexican taste. The portion is pretty big and it comes with pico de gallo.   I got the burrito and would recommend that. You see them making the tortillas and they are pretty thick. I liked it. You can get the burrito enchilada style or just plain.  There are a lot of seats inside. This place is like a grab and go type of place. It is not a waiter restaurant. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"They change the menu around to make it easier to understand"}
{"text":"Wow... Last time I eat at this location.  The employees are not only rude to the customers they only talk to each other while they are serving you.  No wonder they have to ask you two and three times what you wanted... they don't listen to you - only to their co-workers.  Besides having bad employees the food is not very good either and I'm not sure about how safe it is to eat.  I even looked around for the health code rating because I'm sure the meat inside my burrito was below the safe temperature of 135°F.  I guess they thought the burnt tortilla would fool me.   Most of the containers were practically empty so all portions were skimpy. The guy in line behind me even told the employee to restock the lettuce then finish his salad. They only wanted to give him one tong full of lettuce.  At. 6 p.m. on a Saturday night you think they would be well stocked.... and it was not busy at all.  People probably stopped going there because it is so bad.   I purchased two meals and I had a card with 10 stamps on it so I was suppose to get one meal free.  After I paid for the other meal I asked for another stamp card (to use at the Cedar City, Utah location - which is great by the way) The employee told me that I could not have one. I told him I PAID for one of the meals and I should get one stamp.  He literally rolled his eyes, picked up a card, stamped it, handed it to me, and walked away NOT SAYING A WORD.   What a Jerk !!!!  I tried to write a review on the Cafe Rio website so the owners would know how bad this location is.....but their \"Write a review\" is not working.  Maybe they get too many BAD reviews and are tired of reading about them.   My advise to you... Go to Chipotle - it is in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Well I'm updating my last review. As previously stated gave them 2 stars because the food is somewhat good. I don't like dealing with the depressed people inside so I decided moving forward I would place the order online and pick up.  When I arrived a few minutes after my pick up time they told me sorry your order is not ready, it will be faster if you stand in line. How is it faster if I stand in line when have had my order for 45minutes?! They told me it would be an additional 20 minutes to make my order but they could magically make it faster if I stood in line in 10 min before ordering the exact same thing they had on the receipt in front of them. No sense in coming back. I have tried time and time again, and every time it gets worse. This will be my last trip to place I at one point in my life came to weekly. So with this, so long cafe rio."}
{"text":"Over priced and under delivers. Stood in line for 35 minutes on a Wednesday waiting for food. Asked for pork tacos... was told they were out... asked what else was available and response was \"everything else\". This was my first time in and will be my last time. Food was ok at best and could have gotten better and cheaper at either Pollo Loco or Chipotle. Very disappointing considering all the hype."}
{"text":"Pork barbacoa taco, pinto beans and rice with a side of guac...nuf' said.  I crave this...a lot.  My kids-two teens-devour the chicken nachos!  Great place if you are out shopping or running errands and don't want drive thru.."}
{"text":"Good place to pick up some fresh Mexican food. We ordered a barbacoa burrito, steak quesadilla, and chicken quesadilla.  As far as the burrito is concerned, I would say it's slightly smaller than a Chipotle burrito, but better tasting. Overall everything tasted good and was fresh. I would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"I went there on Wednesday at 11;45, the line was okay length but the new cashier was awful needed help on everything which was holding the line up, still needed more training. I got steak tacos and my dad got a green chili pork burrito. Both of them were disgusting and the tacos made me sick and gave me food poisioning. not good go to chipotle right across the street instead."}
{"text":"Service: Absolutely TERRIBLE. The employees have been consistently rude and unfriendly which is why I'm leaving this post. I also was in the store yesterday and the supervisor (I'm assuming bc she was in a red shirt) was barking at the employees and then the employees were all yelling at each other. It was very unprofessional and you can see why the rest of the employees are horrible, it's because the manager or supervisor wasn't the greatest either!   Ordering over the phone: Every single time I've called my order in the person who answers (it's been a guy and a girl up to this point) have been very rude to the point that it is annoying, not to mention super slow when it comes to typing in your order or even paying attention to what you're ordering.  Comments: Cafe top management, please re-train your employees and hire people with better attitudes!"}
{"text":"My question is where is management!?! We live close by and like Mexican food. The only thing consistent is the shitty service. How are you guys so busy ALL the time when service sucks? If we didn't like so close and crave giant burritos we'd never come back again! Imagine how busy you'd be if you actually hired people that could handle more than one order!   I just waited 20 minutes for two burritos and it wasn't because you were swamped. The closer who scoops sour cream couldn't keep orders straight and the cashier was busy restocking cups while I stood there twiddling my thumbs.   Something's wrong here and I really hope they fix it. Makes me wonder what shenanigans are going on (like proper vegetable washing, glove wearing, etc) we don't see....."}
{"text":"Food is tasty! It was my husbands first time and was my 2nd. I ordered Nachos with sweet pork and my husband ordered enchiladas with greensauce pork i think it was.  Like everyone else here, complaints about the staff and i agree. Lady who was making my nacho was not having her day, i hope she would of asked me how much cheese i would like on my nacho but its more like how much chips, meats ect do i want with my cheese, there were more cheese than anything else (if i was a cheese lover then it would have been good). I said no thank you to any beans and she rolled her eyes then I asked for extra guacamole and she scooped half of the scooper and then slammed my plate. I was hoping she would of done the same to my husband but it was a different lady who made his food because if it was the same lady i really would of snapped at her. Anyways we enjoyed our food, shitty lady who took my order and oh she was also rude with the people ahead of us. I wish i could of gotten her name 11/15/16 1pm."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, but I am wondering if they changed management because it has gone downhill. The past two trips I question the cleanliness, this time I saw the cook eating while he was at the grill. The queso was an odd consistency, very gross. Pretty sure the salsa had mint instead of cilantro. Very unusual. Needless to say, I'll be looking for a better alternative."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio but today I am not impressed what so ever. Got home after getting our burritos and as I'm eating I bite into something solid, instantly grossing me out. I pull out of my mouth this item that isn't edible and it turns out to be an inch long piece of cardboard. How cardboard got into my burrito, I have no idea but it's disgusting and absolutely unacceptable. I only ate about a quarter of the burrito before I found the cardboard and just threw the rest away. Beyond unsatisfactory Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"This location is just plain awful!  I've been to other cafe rio locations before, and had to wait maybe 15-20mins which for me although not ideal is something I can deal with without crying like a spoiled baby. The thing I can't deal with is not the longer wait time which at this location was closer to 30mins (I've gotten on rides at Disneyland quicker) but the careless attitude of the staff in the preparation of the food, the clear as day feckless attitude towards customers which includes talking to other staff members about inappropriate behavior they had participated in the previous night, and an apparent lack of any leadership.   Might I add that I am in no way prudish, I myself enjoy inappropriate behavior but while I'm at work I keep it to myself or I wait till patrons who could take offense are far from earshot.   I will not be returning to this location.  I doubt I will even go to any other locations.  There is clearly a lack of giving a fuck from whomever manages this particular location, but more so I lay blame on the corporate end, business must indeed be good because they seem to be completely fine losing customers."}
{"text":"I come to this location at least once a week because it's so close to my house. I LOVE cafe rio. I always get a quesadilla or a burrito. I love their sugar free drinks. I like everything on the menu except the queso. It has a weird consistency. I wish they didn't charge extra for sour cream and such bit other than that no complaints at all."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is always packed, so be prepared to stand in a long line and try to bring a friend along to save a table if you are eating there.  I like that fact that you can order your food how you like it.  I am a fan of the chicken salad and the chicken tostada.  I like to have them go light on the rice and beans because I want to taste the salad.  The fresh tortillas are delicious as is the house salad dressing.  My son loves the burritos enchilada style, and my husband's favorite is the Monday night special of chile rellenos.  He says they are the best chile rellenos he's had which is a huge compliment since he is very picky. The dining area isn't always the cleanest, so be prepared to take a napkin to wipe off the table before you sit down.  I think that this is due to the fact that there's usually people waiting to sit down as someone leaves which doesn't leave any time for employees to wipe down the tables.  The tables are also close together which doesn't leave a lot of room to walk between them.  They also have frequent diner cards to earn free meals.  Make sure you ask for one as you will be back."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is similar to Baja Fresh. Homemade tortillas is really good. Doesn't make sense to charge sour cream when sour cream is cheap. Customer service needs more energy, super slow, I waited a long time to order, instead the crew member turned her back and did something else. I was second in line, the customer in front of me left. I think the restaurant should display their food more for customers to view. Chipotle is WAY better."}
{"text":"pretty dang good for a subway-style mexi joint.   I just went and it was PACKED on a friday lunch hour. the star is knocked for the wait in line - took probably 10 minutes from getting in to paying and walking away with our meals.  but it's not too bad a wait, you can watch the employees preparing all the meals, and that operation is one well-oiled machine! it was fascinating to watch them interact and watch the toritilla lady cranking out disc after disc of handmade tortillas. you watch the dough brown on this giant spinning metal sheet - so as far as waiting in line goes, it could be worse.   i had read that the tostada was one of their specialties, which i thought was interesting cause seriously, how fancy and creative can you get with a tostada? well, i'll tell you...  for $4.95 i got a large take out style metal tin towering with layers of (in order): rice, corn tortilla, more rice, pork barbacoa (or steak/chicken), black beans (or pinto), lettuce - ok, lots and lots of lettuce i mean overkill, but it worked out i'll explain later, cheese sour cream, tortilla strips, pico, cilantro and topped with creamy cilantro dressing, lime wedge.  whoa. i repeat, whoa.   basically, i ate it with a fork and it was like a delicious taco salad...but not. my lunch buddy got the special, for $4.95 a large chicken enchilada, rice and beans. the total with two drinks was like $11, a pretty good price for pretty good fast mexi food."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp tacos on Tuesday! And by substituting a side salad for the rice and beans, we reach perfection. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the number one place of choice when it comes to deciding where to go for lunch during the week. Oh sweet pork barbacoa!!"}
{"text":"This chain has excellent food but the worst service in vegas! Every time I think they might have gone through a management turn over I go back (5-6 months) and they continue to disappoint with their extremely slow service, virtually no customer interaction, and horrible listening skills."}
{"text":"Usually not as busy as the other locations. Parking lot is not great. Love the sweet pork. I usually get burritos or salads. The quesadillas are good too but very greasy."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the queso and chips!   Can't be healthy but very tasty.  Hot, gooey and just the right amount of zest.  Queso is often too salty but this one is just right.  The burrito bowl with salmon is also quite good, as are the burritos, especially with steak.   Parking is a pain sometimes and it can get very crowded, but worth it.  Also very reasonable prices.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Rio but this location is too dirty for me to go back. One of their staff \"cleaned\" up the counter by mixing the dirty pico de gallo stuck along the trim BACK into the container with the fresh one. Also there's black wilted lettuce mixed with the rest then put into my Pork salad along with the dirty pico. I had to cancel my order. Too gross! Hope that their manager would fix this :("}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! The line was long which I can deal with, but the attitude from the workers not cool."}
{"text":"This place was the worst cafe rio I have ever been and I Am a big fan of the franchise. The staff was rude and to lazy to do the normal things like clean tables take out trash re-stock the napkins. The staff was also taking short cuts on how the meal was prepared. The staff was literally talking to each other about personal stuff while we were waiting to be severed. I would not recommend anyone come to this cafe rio across from UNLV."}
{"text":"Everytime I order here they always get my order wrong. I specifically always tell them what I don't want on it and yet they don't pay attention. Even when they gave me 1 free credited meal they still messed it up and never fix it."}
{"text":"Is it wrong that I eat here so much? Nah, it's tasty. What I have fallen in love with here is the tostada and salad, particularly with steak. And since it's a go down the line place, you can specify how much you want of each thing or if you even want it at all. Tip: Get both of the dressings and pour both of them on your tostada or salad - they taste delicious together.  The staff are still a bit hit or miss at times. Some are friendly. Some are efficient. Some clearly wish they were anywhere else but there. Bonus: You can skip the line and order ahead of time online. You also can often save a couple of bucks this way with online only coupons."}
{"text":"If you like decent food but don't value your time, then by all means, eat here! I've been 3 times so far and each time I liked my food...when I finally got it. My husband and I got to Café Rio at 12:45 on a Saturday and it was, understandably busy. We debated whether or not we should go someplace else but my husband had his heart set on the Chile Roast Beef Tacos, so I got in line while he took our 4 month old and found a table. The line was long so I checked to see if I could just order online and pickup after a reasonable amount of time but the website said 30 minutes so I decided that I'd just wait in line for a bit. I sat down with my food 45 minutes later. By that time, the nice, almost kid free lunch date we'd managed to score was reduced to 10 minutes of slamming down our food and balancing a fussy baby who had been asleep for most of the time I was waiting in line. I probably won't ever go back since EVERY SINGLE TIME has been this way. The prices are high with all the extras they charge you for ($2.59 for a regular soda). If time is money, you're wasting yours here."}
{"text":"My favorite: barbacoa salad w/ house dressing! Big enough for 2 people, under $10, made to order. Say yes when they ask if you want cheese grilled onto the tortilla ;) military discount is great. Horchata is delicious here."}
{"text":"I actually give zero stars. Worst staff I have ever experienced. And I've actually been 6 times in the last month hoping it will get better, it's right next to the gym so should be perfect. All the food and topping are dry and old, the specialty juices are always empty and all 6 times I have ordered a Tres leeches cake and each time they had u the cake and if u ask for the whip cream and strawberries they tell you they are out and sorry and walk away. Once or maybe twice I could see that happening, every time come on now we can see how this place is ran now. And don't even try and get the shrimp tacos on Tuesday (won't happen). And I absolutely love cafe rio but this location has killed it for me and after reading the other reviews every one else is having the same negative experiences"}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic. This is my whole family's #1 choice on any given night.  That's because every single item here is delicious, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is lively, and the staff are great. The drinks selection is amazing, too, with a station set up with a variety of flavors you can add, and \"specialty\" drinks like horchata and fresh lemonades.  My brother obsesses over the specials over the day, but on just about ANY given day I'm craving the Pork Barbacoa Salad.  You know the place is good because at ANY time of the day, the place is almost full.  Seriously one of the best casual dining options in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible, ordered online got there then waited nearly 30 minutes just to get the food, people there didn't even have forks to eat there food, employees we're yelling at customers to sit down and wait while they bring them there. Rude customer service. Never coming back here again which is weird just about 6 months ago they had there stuff together now they are horrible."}
{"text":"So frustrating. The only reason I came here was because Costa Vita is closed on Sunday. The customer service is appalling! I called in my order, showed up at the time I was told my order would be ready they hadn't even started it. When it was ready it was incorrect, the guy blamed me for the fact that it was wrong. They made it again but gave me attitude about it. When I got home I found that the order was still wrong and the other items were soggy because I had to wait. This is my 2nd negative experience there with poor customer service and I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"So I guess you guys close a whole hour early I see how it is. I guess I'll go somewhere that can be open till 11pm like it says you should be"}
{"text":"I am a great fan on this place. But discovered it's becoming like Subway. Go early else you will be served food like leftover. Still a fan of their pork burrito enchiladas style. But was kinda surprised yesterday during dinner. I will not recommend this place for dinner after 8."}
{"text":"Cafe rio leaves me speechless every time I eat there.  Absolutely.  Amazing.  Their salads with chicken or beef have the most amazing house dressing I have ever had.  I could drink it."}
{"text":"This is the only Cafe Rio I've ever had problems with. The past 4 times I've ordered online or over the phone, my order has been messed up and is not ready on time. I've given this location the benefit of the doubt because they can be busy but tonight I've had enough. My pick up order was not ready until 20 minutes after the pick up time. I ordered an enchilada style burrito and it has no sauce on the outside. The beans are wrong. The burrito didn't hold and was unraveled before I touched it. I'm so disappointed. Even though this Eastern/Richmar location is closest to my house, I'm going to start going to the other ones because I'm tired of the consistently poor quality of service I receive."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend today and had a steak salad. Food was good, but after a few hours I found out I got food poisoning for the first time in my life. Never eating at a Cafe Rio ever again..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love cafe rio, however, I just left there and I am not sure I will return to this location.  The girl working the first station taking your order messed mine up which I didn't realize until the very end (quesadilla v. Kids quesadilla), she was basically slopping the sauces and meat around on the other orders I saw her make. Also, her gloves were dripping with sauces but she still didn't change them and instead shook her hand and then wiped them on a dirty looking towel, and kept handling other people's meat/cheese/tortilla. The line was extremely slow and I'm not sure the person working it even had knowledge of what was supposed to go in to my tortilla soup. At checkout the cashier said they'd remake the quesadilla which is fine but then brought us the to go container with a piece of meat hanging out of the lid and juice dripping down the side. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The 2 postive things I can say are the food still tasted good and the manager was nice and apologized for the long wait. Now the bad, online order was done 20 minutes late, asked for an extra side of dressing, but only received one dressing for 2 salads and the one extra side of dressing. My wife did not get pick or the rice she ordered. I ordered a chicken salad with no beans, received a sweet pork salad with beans. While I was waiting in line, one of the employees answered the phone and told the manager the person on the phone got home and their steak burrito had no steak in it. Love Cafe Rio, probably won't come to this one again."}
{"text":"I like to have lunch here after getting my nails done. The Chicken Tortilla Soup is amazing and a good fill up without making you feel gross."}
{"text":"When will they seek out a plan . You order but there is 7 people waiting to pay. By the time you pay the food is cold"}
{"text":"I get here at 1130 and  minimall wait time. I eat here once a week and pick up catering orders every week. My catering orders can be thirty to forty people and it's NEVER been wrong. I love  the steak burrito enchilada style with the hot sauce and it's always amazing. I don't use the website to order my catering. I call and speak to a live person and they have always been very helpful  . If you are going and have a list of four or more orders please call in so your order so your not  holding everyone else up while you decide what dressing you want."}
{"text":"Worst Cafe Rio in Las Vegas. This place consistently runs out of popular ingredients  45 min before closing. I have tried to call in an order and they have not had my food 4 different times.  They should close earlier if they run out of product.   Today when I came in at around 2:30 there was no mint lemon-aide when I asked for them to replace it I received attitude. At the time I was the only customer in the line.   My grilled chicken was very chewy and lacked the consistency that i usually come to expect at other locations. I'm not sure if this location has managment that lacks the energy and effort to run this amazing business the way it should be run."}
{"text":"Found long black hair and a Bobby pin in my food tonight . Will not be going back EVER!!! Service was completely TERRIBLE!! The staff was extremely unorganized and unsanitary !!!! Called the store to complain about the items I found in my food and the manager knew about it since this morning !!!! (6/14/18) !!! If you had other customer complaints on metal objects being found in the meat, WHY CONTINUE TO SERVE IT ?!?! Totally disgusted and will be contacting their corporate office"}
{"text":"NEVER COMING TO CAFE RIO! Worst customer service, The young boy on the register went to the back to mess around, came back to collect my payment (I ordered online) was super rude, the other girl came and practically tossed my friends order, after opening my plate at WORK it was missing everything!!!!! NEVER WILL I COME HERE OR ANY OTHER."}
{"text":"Pricey and Fattening!  But delicious!  :)  Mouth-watering entrees that cannot be found elsewhere in the state."}
{"text":"This place blows. Our office has ordered my phone, online, and in person each week for the past three weeks and our orders have been messed up EVERY SINGLE TIME. Today was in excusable. All 4 orders were messed up, as they were even written down and handed to the employees and then the manager decides to say that it was our fault. On top of that, we called in before we had to DRIVE BACK TO THIS SHITHOLE and he hug up on us and the excuse was that they \"were busy because of taco Tuesday\". Employees and manager here have no customer services skills whatsoever."}
{"text":"Shredded chicken Tacos were daaaank! My experience would have been a little bit better had the girl not had a attitude over doing her job but  good foods worth it."}
{"text":"The girls were some of the most unfriendly and awkward people ever. Food is good though. Don't expect good customer service though."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Cafe Rio, located on Lake Mead and Buffalo in a small shopping center behind Mickey Dee's. I love the fresh made tortillas here and believe it or not the salads are my go-to item. They are massive and extremely filling. They line the bottom with a tortilla, and then add meat and your choice of toppings. I usually always choose the pork barbacoa which is sweet shredded pork and it is so delicious, I just cant bring myself to order anything different. The dressings for the salad are creamy cilantro and vinaigrette which are both tasty, but I prefer the cilantro which is perfect for dipping leftover tortilla into.  Other items include burritos, nachos, tacos and enchiladas. The burritos can be made enchilada style where they douse the burrito in sauce and cheese then run it through the oven. The red enchilada sauce is really tasty, and I usually get it on the side to dip chips into. Speaking of chips, they give you a brown paper bag FULL of them when you order chips and salsa or queso. The queso tasted like melted American cheese and I didnt like it, so I threw most of it away. Not worth its almost $5 price tag.   My last visit I tried the pork enchiladas with rice and pinto bean and I was not too impressed. The enchiladas were pretty skimp on the meat, although there was plenty of sauce and cheese, and the rice and beans had no flavor. I wouldn't order this again and would stick with either a burrito or salad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm not sure why it has such a low rating. It's like a chipotle style restaurant but much better. Their tortillas are one of the best flour tortillas I've ever had actually. I had a grilled steak wet burrito. Everything was super fresh. Also they have fresh drinks they make there. A huge plus for me. The service kind of sucked and was pretty slow but what can you do? Thank god I came during slower business hours. I can't imagine how they would handle a busy crowd."}
{"text":"Let me just say the 4 stars is for the pork barbacoa. It is amazing. The service on the other hand is not so great. The employees are just rude and don't even offer a smile so it makes me really not want to go back. And they are pretty Skimpy on the meat. Oh and the sour cream and guacamole that they offer you are not free so don't fall for it. I will definitely be back for the pork but I might try another location!"}
{"text":"Seriously Vegas!?!?! Is THIS what you consider Mexican food? Good Food? This isnt even on the standards of Chipotle!!!! I gave this place 3 tries... every time the food was cold, the order was wrong, the workers behind the counter are totally useless and worse yet the food was beyond NASTY!!!! Theres not enough salsa, hot sauce and wishful thinking to make this stuff good. Every single person who gave this place 5 stars deserves a fat ass kick in the face... dont trust these dummies who consider this good food!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Cafe Rio for years in Utah.  This location in Peoria, AZ has a lot to learn.  Manager was rude, they forgot the creamy tomatillo house dressing and the guacamole.  I guess the further you get away from Utah (corporate offices) the worse the service."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is pretty good but it's a hit and miss when it comes to their rice, most of my orders came with half cooked rice. I know opt out of it. Everything else is pretty good & fresh. I always go for their Chile Roasted Beef, their Sweet Pork Barbacoa is way too sweet for my taste & it tends to kill the dish for me.   They do provide a rewards app where you can get specials & earn points towards a discount/freebie."}
{"text":"First Let me say, \"I love Café Rio!\".  However this location needs a new manager or franchise owner to bring this restaurant back to presentable conditions.  Upon my last two visits, the experience was terrible.  Server was rude, food was served cold, Ice Machine for soda was broken, and aqua fresca machines where down as well.  Just to note these visits where around lunch time 1PM to 3PM.  I work all over the valley and other Café Rio's are always a great choice for lunch or dinner, but not this one."}
{"text":"My first time eating here! I don't know what took me so long since it's my husband 'canteen'! He eats here at least twice a week. I ordered the Pork Green Chili burrito with habanero sauce. It was so delicious! The shredded pork was so tender and the sauce just seals the deal with melted cheese on top!  I wished I had taken a  photo of how ginormous the burrito was! I'll be taking more trips to Rio now!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here as a New Year greeting when he picked me up from the airport last weekend. My first impression walking in was \"ugh another assembly line\". To be honest, I'm quite tired of the assembly line type of restaurant, because my mind usually races back to Chipotle, which is a challenge to compete with.   Anyway, I wasn't impressed by the food quality, as I thought it was just OK. It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. I also thought the ridiculous prices were way too much for what you got. I'd probably give it higher rating if the prices were much lower and/or the food tasted good.  I can't back up this place. I'd say find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"The food was good. Nothing to write home about. Not any better than Chipotle or Qdoba, especially considering the price! Tasty and a sufficient portion, and they make their own tortillas. However, the service was surly and aggressive. Food line girl seemed uninterested and unfriendly (this was my first visit, so I had questions). Cashier guy behaved as if I had done something wrong, and called me \"man,\" which, maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine, but doesn't seem like respectful customer service. The lack of a fork or napkins with my To-Go order made it kinda hard to manage.   $9 for 2 tacos, rice and beans seems like too much, regardless of other factors."}
{"text":"Yuck! The food is really runny and cold. I don't recommend eating here. Go the distance to chiptole because it is really worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty regular Chipotle eater and can totally appreciate the assembly line style of choosing exactly what you want in your meal, and after hearing a recommendation from someone who prefers Cafe Rio, I figured sure, I'll give it a shot. The seats and tables were the first thing I noticed since they're brightly colored and spattered with paint, but after that I realized I came to eat and not to stare at furniture, so I moved on to the menu, which was about as straightforward and simple as could be.  I got a burrito, mainly since the tortillas looked amazing, with chicken, black beans, rice, etc. It's boring, but pretty much exactly what I get at Chipotle, and I wanted to compare. The sad part came when I got to the register, as it came to $10 and change without any of the additional options and a basic drink. Not bad if considering it as restaurant quality food, but as standard higher-end fast food, it gets into some dicey territory as far as price goes.   The drink area was surprisingly great, with a tons of choices and additional in-house teas, limeades, and even horchata. The burrito was great too. It was hot, the chicken was flavorful, and the tortilla turned out to taste as good as it looked.   The girlfriend on the other hand wasn't impressed. She got the two taco plate with beef, which was the same price, and I wouldn't be mentioning it if I didn't agree with her; the beef tacos were on a completely different level as the burrito. The tin foil they came in was full of grease, and the tacos were soaked in it. They were soggy and bland. Some grease is to be expected with beef, but this was a little overwhelming, and turned the tacos into a big wet glob of food. It would've been worth it if the beef had some substantial flavor, but they didn't.  Ultimately, the glory of the chicken burrito was not completely overshadowed by the greasy beef, although the tacos were admittedly bad. Would I pick it over a Chipotle burrito? Probably not. It was hotter and tasted great, but was also a bit smaller, more expensive, and more sloppily thrown together than what I get at Chipotle, with less topping options too. Definitely a decent place for some quick, fresh Mexican food, but I'm staying far away from the beef."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is excellent... but this location is terrible. MULTIPLE visits, and essentials are missing. Something is consistently out,  items like steak, grilled chicken, drinks, queso, SALT.  The staff is usually peppered with an employee or two that are indifferent, or rude... I am reluctant to mention this due to the common 'excellent' employee who is aware and apologetic. Hard to look the other way when this is a trend here.  This location is close by, and I keep coming back but never again. I will be going elsewhere. 2 stars because of tha name and food is good. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went there and the Tuesday mennu said coconut shrimp... well got up to louder and was told they ran out... dammm that sounded so good... place is good ..fresh food ... my son got the BBQ beef it was a little to greasy to me but my 15 year old liked it...  I think they should be more friendly service, but they are all young kids behind the counter..   I feel the one on Maryland pkway in run a lot better ..."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I usually order the chicken salad but I love the chicken tacos too. It's the creamy green cilantro dressing that makes it all worth it. I dip the soft shell from my salad in the dressing just to have an excuse to eat more dressing. The staff is always nice and the place is really fun. The lunch and dinner lines can be long sometimes so if you can order ahead on the app or just call it will really save you sometime. But the food is always fresh and yummy! You should go there right now. Don't forget to download the app and get lots of points to save money on your next meal!"}
{"text":"An open letter to Cafe Rio: The 1st star is for the sweet Barbacoa taco, and the second star is for the tortilla. The first time I visited your cafe was in Newport Beach, California. It was overpriced and took way too long to get my food considering there were 3 people in front of me. I let that first bad experience slide since it was my first time, so I gave you the benefit of the doubt. The second time I went, same thing. Then the 3rd time, same thing. That was it. I was swearing off cafe rio. All was well in my world. Then, you decided to put a location smack dab in the middle of my town. North Phoenix. All these locals were stoked about New Mexican food. All it got from me was an eye roll. Unfortunately all my friends LOVE cafe rio. Sure, it's good. But dealing with the never-ending line, overall confused taco/burrito assembly line people, it's just annoying.   There needs to be more training for your burrito people. They were only utilizing one of the line people, while the other sat and stared and said \"I can't help cause I'm gonna get yelled at.\" WHAT? I'm gonna be the one yelling if you keep letting my  taco sit on the line getting no attention.   whatever, cafe rio!"}
{"text":"Ordered the soup for lunch and was shockingly disappointed. Usually the food here is so good! The soup was basically water with chicken and seasoning in it. I ordered it for lunch and brought it back to work otherwise I would have asked for something else. Unfortunately since I already spent the money and had to get back to work.. that's what I was left to eat. I've never had to worry about the quality of the food form this place so I'm very surprised and sad the soup was so disgusting and plain. It wasn't even soup, to be honest. I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Food is fresh and prepared to your liking.  Restaurant is good size with plenty of seating options.  Their drink selection was awesome!  Cleaning dining area."}
{"text":"What's the point of \"ordering ahead\" if it would have been faster to stand in line... makes ZERO sense.   I ordered at 6:15 for 6:45 pick up.. i get here, my Foods not ready.. i look at the people in line.. and I kic you not. The people who were in the back of the line are sitting down eating and my food is still not ready."}
{"text":"First time at this place came to vegas for a birthday celebration was in the mood for Mexican food found this place on yelp decided to check it out. Came in very long line it has the chipotle style ordering system but very unorganized waiting for about half an hour in the line. Finally got up to order very nice guy took my order got through the line after my food was found like I said very unorganized plates are everywhere. Prices are ok I have had better for a lot cheaper I figured their is a lot of white people so it must be good. I got the burrito with shredded chicken with the enchilada sauce it was very salty wish I wouldn't have gotten the sauce also got a pork taco very good super flavor 3 stars because I had to wait that long line don't come hungry cuz of line. Also it has no salsa bar"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill so fast. If you call in your order be prepared to stay on hold for a min of 8-15 mins. When I placed my order of only two items the order was wrong. Not only did I have to wait the order I received was wrong."}
{"text":"Really--don't bother.  With all the other Mexican restaurants nearby, don't waste your time here.  Unless you just are in a rush for cheap eats with a half a dozen kids in tow.  But still, there are so many other options nearby.  I went here as I had a gift card.  I asked for veggie quesadilla.  The sign said it came with \"extra beans and rice\".  The girl at the serving line asked if I wanted the rice and beans in the quesa.  I said \"on the side.\"  She said that the next people on the line would take care of it.  I had a choice of other things to go with it.  I said lettuce and guac.  They didn't mention rice and beans.  I waited 5 minutes for the cashier to show up and cash me out.  F-cking food was growing cold as I waited.  Finally I got my drink cup from her and cashed out.  Gift card paid for most of my meal.  I got a mint limeade for a drink. Turned out to be the best part of the meal.  I ate the quesadilla...fairly flavorless except for the hot sauce I added.  The lettuce on the side looked tired.  Guac was just ok...not much flavor there either.  Then I remembered I never got any rice or beans.  By then, I just didn't care.  I finished my quesa and bolted.  I swear, you can get a better meal at Chipotle's."}
{"text":"I love you guys. Fresh food that tastes great each time. Good service (in store & app).   Special kudos to the brunette lady that is so knowledgeable and obviously pro cafe rio. I asked why the dressing was so hot, she said peppers are season (so I switched to vinaigrette for a little bit which was so good too). I've heard her answer a lot of questions during my visit there and she answers with sincere passion each time.   My fave: shredded chicken salad & tres leches for dessert (which is free if you answer the short survey on your food receipt). Cafe Rio rewards app is where it's at! Love it."}
{"text":"My coworkers from SLC kept raving about this place one day, saying it was the best Mexican food you'll ever find. I was in the neighborhood today, so I gave it a shot.   They asked if I had ever been there before, I said no. They gave me a sample of their pork. Pork is supposed to be good because you have good quality meat and do a good job cooking it, not because you slopped on too much sugary sauce. It was almost like they were trying to hide the taste of the meat.   Settled on cheese enchiladas. Was given the choice of mild, medium, or hot sauce. I LOVE spicy stuff, so of course the choice was obvious. My Diet Dr. Pepper had more of a kick. The food quality was OK. I finished everything, so it wasn't horrible. It was very bland, however. The final kicker was the price. Nearly $10 for two enchiladas and a soda (none of the add-ons that Than discussed, either)? Come on, really?   The pluses are that the employees were very friendly and did their job well, and the restaurant was clean and well decorated for this type of place (think along the lines of a Rubio's or Taco del Mar).  When I visit Seattle and order Mexican, this is the type of food I expect. But this is Arizona. There's much better Mexican food around here."}
{"text":"We had Cafe Rio cater a lunch at our main campus on Tuesday. The food was excellent. The amount of food we got for the price was impressive. The food was fresh and the driver and the store personnel were so accommodating. Highly recommend this place for a catering option. Super good!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst establishment I have visited. To begin with the wait to even give my order was excessively long. Only 2 people on the line which I can't understand since it was dinner rush. I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas and to my surprise the tortillas were not cooked all the way through, extremely gummy and thick. I do not recommend this location visit Chandler Blvd instead! Eaters beware."}
{"text":"The tortillas here are divine! So yummy! The food is fresh and the service is efficient and attentive. It's a line up, order what you want cafeteria-line style, pay, and go find a place to sit type of place.  My fiance had the pork burrito (which was a pretty good size -- sure filled him up) with a side of sour cream for about $8. He enjoyed it b/c he didn't speak a word while eating haha. I got a shredded chicken taco and a vegetarian taco. They gave me plenty of chicken and toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, pico de gallo, and other salsas, but they ripped me off on the guacamole that was supposed to be in the veggie taco. I got about 2 bites of guac (which were yummy) and that was it :( -- so make sure to check for it haha. I also got rice and beans with my tacos, which were whatever tasting. I couldn't finish both tacos, 1 is filling.  Definitely a place that can satisfy hunger -- really good sized portions. Also, it's a great place if you're in a time crunch because you can get in, order, eat, and be out within 30 min. If I have a choice of eating here again, I definitely will be back.  Our total bill: for a pork burrito, side of sour cream, 2 tacos with rice & beans, and a regular soda: $18.74."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry and came here for lunch because we wanted something quick. The line was pretty long, but it went really fast. You can see them making fresh tortillas as you get up to the counter.  I got a fire grilled steak burrito and it was huge! They make it as you are up there. You can also get your burrito enchilada style, with sauce and cheese over it, which seemed to be very popular.   They put the food in an aluminum tin, so if you can't finish, you just grab a cover to put over it and take it to go for later. For a Mexican fast food place, the food was pretty good. Next time I go back I'll have to try one of their taco salads."}
{"text":"There were two people working and only one person in line ahead of me. I stood there for 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging me. Even when they decided they would serve me they didn't even say \"Hello\" or \"Sorry for the wait.\" One girl had no idea how to wrap a burrito, as she dumped out all the fillings when she tried to wrap it.   I had heard of this place for awhile and wanted to give it a try but I won't be back. I ordered a sweet pork burrito with pinto beans and rice. I was expecting to add more to it but she quickly wrapped it up and put it in the oven without asking me if I wanted anything else. They did put lettuce and Pico on the side. The pork itself was too sweet for my taste.   I'll be sticking with chipotle from here on out."}
{"text":"Standing in line and listening to the red headed overweight employee make fun my bowl because there was no meat and no lettuce in it and then going on talking about it to another employee. Sorry I'm trying to make better eating choices. Don't realize that was something you needed to make fun of and talk to your other employee about in front of me, your guest. Great way to treat customers."}
{"text":"This location is especially dirty, trash is always over flowing, tables are filthy, and a very un-friendly staff. Food is not bad but the cleanliness of the place is horrible."}
{"text":"In general, I love Cafe Rio. I think that the food is generally very good. However, this location seems to be a problem child for the brand. The workers preparing the food and taking payments are generally slower that other locations, which if you happen to go during a busy time can lead to LONG waits. Also, on many occasions this location was out of essential ingredients for items on their menu. It became a joke for my family to guess what they would be out of this time. I was going to give this location a 3 star rating, however, when reading the description of the stars, the 2-star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" seemed to be the most appropriate way to describe my experience with this location. There are other locations on Stephanie and on Eastern. You'll probably be more happy with your overall experience if you go to one of those locations. I'd give either one of those locations a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The handmade tortillas are fantastic! I get the salad & I love the dressing. It's fresh and very tasty. The staff at this location are doing a great job, friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place has my new favorite tacos... and drinks! I went this Tuesday and though they are understaffed at the moment, the wait wasn't any longer than expected. Besides I would have waited twice as long for those amazing sweet pork tacos! It's hard to find a place that Wows me with such a fresh flavor and Cafe Rio definitely exceeded my expectations.   The staff was extremely friendly, put the food together flawlessly with lightening speed. I can tell they are really trying to please customers and I'm glad because I hope they stick around! This is my new favorite lunch spot. I only wish they worked with a food delivery service so I could have their tacos for dinner more often. Even the kids love it"}
{"text":"Well.... it's not great; the teenagers that work there really don't want to be there; the food is meh; been to better cafe rios around town than this.  Too bad because this one is close to home."}
{"text":"Very good taco salad. It had all the right fixins but I founds that they put a lot of beans on the bottom to make up for the chicken. It was seasoned a bit salty, but it was very fresh and delicious. I will ask for less seasonings on the meat next time."}
{"text":"The food is getting worse and the service was terrible tonight.  Sloped and ice cream scoop full of pico all over the food."}
{"text":"1st and last visit to the West Lake Mead location. Walking in I heard people grumbling about poor service, and after 35 minutes in line, from the first menu board, I would agree. I asked 2 people, 3 times for Spicy Pork, but I got Sweet Pork, and the person in front of me asked for Steak and was told they were out, and I also ordered family size chips, guacamole and salsa and got a half full container of guacamole , and can you imagine? They were OUT of salsa! (pico de gallo) At lunchtime! 12:30 on a Friday! Nope, not coming back to this location...  db"}
{"text":"Called to place or order for pick up, waited ten minutes, no one answered. Called back waited for another ten minutes no one answered. This place blows. I'll order somewhere else then."}
{"text":"Again, the health department needs to teach these workers why gloves are worn, these employees wear them to protect their hands, not MY food."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a low rating.  I have never had a problem here and the food has always been delicious and filling.  It may be a little slow at times but this place gets crowded.  I don't mind waiting for good food.  Whether ordering online or in person, I always get my food in a timely matter and am enjoying it at home within a few minutes which is really all I ask for."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I am a big Chipotle fan, and will probably remain a Chipotle fan. This place was pretty good, just not as good as others. The enchilada style is kind of cool, but this place is trying to gain a buck around every corner. Their burritos are expensive as it is, then they add extra for things like sour cream or making it enchilada style and the drinks are pricey as well. The steak was burnt, but the pork was sweet and very tasty. The tortilla's are sub par compared to Chipotle's as well. The rice isn't as tasty either. You might be thinking, why did they get a four then. Well the food was good enough and plenty enough. The service was fine, not much they could do for fast food mexican restraunt. They had a lot of choices for your drink. Lots of interesting teas, lemonade, and all your standard sodas."}
{"text":"Food is great but the portions are small compared to chipotle. I like chipotle more because they load up my burrito. I ask for more rice and and they said it would cost more but they only put a half scoop. There portions are a joke"}
{"text":"I've been before for the sweet pork tacos, which i highly recommend; although this last visit they advertised Cancun shrimp tacos as the Saturday special which (in the picture) included cabbage like most shrimp tacos but when i received my plate i got shrimp on a tortilla with only lettuce and Pico. When i asked why my taco had different ingredients than in the picture the manager replied \"we don't have cabbage, we only carry regular lettuce\" and when i asked about the tomatillo sauce that's mentioned in the description a different employee said \"oh did you want that?\" Overall i was very unhappy with the false advertisement of the pictures being displayed compared to what they were offering."}
{"text":"Heads up, they put chicken stock in all of their rice (and apparently sauces), which was frustrating given I told them I was vegetarian. It wasn't until the third visit that one of the employees told me."}
{"text":"Honestly, I came here during school and was new to the area.  I didn't know better.  Portions are big and so are the prices (college student).  Usually hard to find seating during lunch hours.  I ordered a burrito, very typical tasting.  I have had better at other legit Mexican places.  Place is average clean.  Beats eating at the Student Union.  Parking is a plenty"}
{"text":"Placed an online order.  They needed this up so bad. We ordered fire grilled nachos, a kids meal chicken quesodillo, 8 Oz guacamole and 8 Oz quesodillo. They completely forgot the guacamole and the queso, and didn't include any of the extras that come with the kids meal. I call and Chris answers and makes me wait. When he comes back he hums and hahs, but can't figure out a solution. His response is to come back next time and they will refund it, I asked if we were supposed to just rely on them at a future date. He also verified the sides that come with the kids meal (lettuce and Pico De gallo) but then started we should have added them as extras?!?! So they are part of the meal but we should have ordered them separate? Has to be the worse case of incompetence I've ever seen. I will definitely never return to ANY cafe Rio and will discourage others!"}
{"text":"Excellent food polite service, I love the fact I can tell the staff what and how much to put on the plate, you can smell and taste the freshness of the ingredients. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent, especially compared to Chipotle. It's right across the street from campus, so I find myself going here a lot [ but mostly because my friends want to go].   The pork barbacoa is really good. Sweet, tender, and goes great in the burrito. And unlike Chipotle, this establishment puts all their burritos through their little toaster/heater thing, which I enjoy. Not a big fan of cold food, let alone cold burritos. They also offer daily specials, such as fish tacos or tamales so there is a little variety every time you go.   Prices here are a bit steep. And the staff seems to be trained into tricking new comers to get all the costly upgrades, such as getting burritos enchilada style and getting sour cream. They make it seem like these upgrades aren't really a big deal and don't mention that they cost more.   They do offer a stamp card, so be sure to get one when you go. Buy 10 items, get 1 free."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat.  We started eating at Cafe Rio when we lived in Utah.  Recently moved to Vegas and there is a Cafe Rio close to our house.  My son loves their pork barbocoa burrito.  They have a different special everyday.  My favorite daily special is their coconut shrimp tacos.  They are the best.  We always get chips and queso with our orders.  The food is always fresh and hot.  Their salads are to die for but be ready for a big feast.  I can never eat a whole salad.  The Tomatillo dressing which is their house dressing is out of this world.   I could not say enough great things about Café Rio.  They also have a frequent dinner card you get stamped when you purchase a meal.  After you have ten stamps you get a free meal.   WE LOVE CAFE RIO..."}
{"text":"We LOVE Cafe Rio!!! So glad that we bought a house just across the street! There is nothing negative about this place. We LOVE the sweet pork ANYTHING. They make their own tortillas right in front of you. Everything is FRESH and made to order. We have had their tacos(TACO TUES...$1.50 tacos, 3 tacos w/rice, beans & drink $8!), the burritos bigger than your head(my husband & I share), and their SALAD..heavenly!!! ;) My husband & I have shared their salad too...the portion are very generous. The salad starts with a fresh made warm tortilla on the bottom(I suppose you can order without if you are watching your carbs, but I just can't resist!), then on top your salad is built. Have I mentioned their SWEET PORK? Mmmmm...I am hungry just thinkin about it! It can be overwhelming a bit when you walk in at lunchtime(especially on taco Tues.), but do not fret, the lines go fast and your reward at the end is worth it! Oh, & they are open till 10 during the week, and for a couple that work out night, the fact that this treasure is open that late in Gilbert/Mesa...I would add 5 more stars if I could! Can you tell we love, Love, LOVE this place!?! Go, you won't regret it! ;)"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awful. This can't be what southern Texas food rio grande área food taste like. Horrible plating, sweet chili pork is god awful and I won't ever go back to any Cafe Rio.  So I sit and eat in the restaurant. The tv is playing the most boring videos ever. Farms and veggies, on the screen. The music was as bad as it gets. Definitely wasn't southern Texas music.   This place is a scam on Mexican food.  Smh. Never again"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 5-star for the plain simple fact: The Pork Barbacoa is AMAZING!!! It beats any meat, at any mexican restaurant. I always put it in the enchilada with the green sauce and I can't stray because it's that good.   Can't help anyone with the rest of the menu, sorry :("}
{"text":"I wish they had a Cafe Rio up in the Bay Area, but sadly they don't! I came here for lunch, and while there were a lot of people in line the ordering was quick and pleasant.  The meats were savory and flavorful here, I couldn't believe it.  I was so used to \"seemingly fresh meat at Chipotle\".  They make their tortilla's fresh, you can see the employees make them right in front of you!   Also, their portions are pretty big, I couldn't even finish my order.  In a lot of other reviews there is a comparison to Chipotle, but I believe that Cafe Rio comes in on top! What a great place to get a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Incompetent employees. I had to watch them very carefully to catch all the mistakes they were making with my very simple order. Once we got that straight after several do overs they told me the credit card machine was down and that they could only except cash. I did not have the requisite amount of cash on hand so I ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, prepared right in front of you. Handmade tortillas are slung on a large circular griddle, just like your Mexican grandma used to make.  The chicken tortilla soup is to die for!"}
{"text":"Food always good but...consistently late on take out orders, misread orders, ingredients not available - one time lettuce was not available, tonight it was tortilla chips.  5 out of five times. Come on people!!!!"}
{"text":"These idiots hate their job and make it a miserable experience to even go there. I wasn't even done telling them my order and they already moved on to asking the person after me what they wanted. I repeated what I wanted more than 5 times and they still didn't wana do it. It might as well be serve yourself buffet because these idiots don't want to do their jobs, are miserable all day long, and make the customers feel uncomfortable. Worst service ever shut this stupid place down already. People already got sick too many times. Losers."}
{"text":"Love cafe rio. One of my favorite spots to hit for lunch. Tortilla soup is the best. Whenever we go, Yelsy always helps us out with her exemplary customer service. Will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I can't even order here. It's like families meet Mexican cafeteria. I can't do it! I walked in early to meet a friend and told him to meet me elsewhere. Ewww ;("}
{"text":"Everyone knows that the barbeque pork is their best meat. And, I eat it every time I'm here. But recently, I discovered their nacho cheese. It's ridiculously good. They give you about 2 servings of cheesy dip that is creamy, salty but well rounded, and has specks of salsa in it. And they give you a whole plate of chips. I'm not a big fan of gringo food but I have to admit that Cafe Rio does gringo food good!  Oh and yes, this cheese goes directly to your thighs."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I feel \"stressed out\" going here because I have to keep telling the staff to give me more of a portion, second the staff is incredibly rude, third the only good thing about this place is the ingredients, except when you order a salad and the tortilla is as hard as a frisbee from sitting on the flat iron pre-made for the next customer.."}
{"text":"When I saw a Cafe Rio was opening in my neighborhood, I'm not ashamed to admit I filled with Christmas-level glee. I like the place a lot. And now it was finally nearby!  Since then I've come to this location for lunch 1-3 times per week and find the staff to be genuinely friendly and helpful. The food is always very good and they make it as quickly as all the other locations I've visited (translation.. not super quick). After all, they are making customized dishes on a per person basis.   Some other reviews here complain of missing food items. That has not been my experience. One time I had to wait a few minutes for a new batch of red sauce to be ready, but when it came up it was the best I've ever tasted.   I agree they seem a bit understaffed, but with a little patience and kindness I've found it to be a wonderful place to eat. The food is very tasty and reasonably priced.   The only other choices for decent Mexican are Wahoo's (meh) or the 20 minute drive to another Cafe Rio to wait in a line that 'might' move faster but will certainly take way more time overall.    I'm voting with my dollars to keep this neighborhood Cafe Rio going strong."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is one of the few mid-price lunch places that's worth a  20 + minute drive. I'm not much of a veggie eater, but I could eat their salad every stinkin' day (the cilantro lime vinaigrette is like nectar from heaven).    When I'm feeling like I can spare the calories I go for the enchiladas, either chicken or the sweet pork barbacoa. Ask for extra cheese and everyone behind the counter explodes in praise, \"extra cheese!\" Hot, sweet, cheesy and drenched in red sauce, they are always gone so soon from the old-style foil tin they are served in.  But a highlight, of course, is the handmade flour tortillas. So tender and almost flakey. How do they do it? What evil pact has Cafe Rio made to be blessed with such good food? We may never know, but in the meantime, go early and often."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place at first, but after visiting it is definitely a place to keep in your quick outing rotation (off-diet, of course).  The layout is a little crowded and there is almost always a line but after eating the food you will see why this place is consistently busy.  Fret not, the line is quick!  Seating leaves a lot to be desired but we almost always just order to-go or order online for pick-up so it's a non-issue.  Side note:  Be careful when entering and crossing between the seats and the soda station (the main walk to the line) as I have almost been ran over by children and adults rushing for soda.  I dunno, maybe there was a soda shortage and I missed the memo.  People who make the food are attentive, quick, and friendly.  Awesome.  Every now and again we will get someone on the register who is usually not with the program like the rest of the staff is and has to ask three or four times what we ordered and even still will try to charge us the wrong amount.  It's not from confusion from the rest of the team, however -- I have caught the person at the register often joking and not paying attention to the customers.  Serious downer, but I am pretty firm (read: attention-grabbing because I want to GTFO of line and EAT!) now and it helps.  What to order: Fire-grilled chicken nachos.  Extra cheese.  I like when they yell extra cheese, sue me."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch on a late Saturday afternoon. It was still a little busy from it being opening week, so there was a bit of a line. The staff was quick though, so the wait wasn't too long.  The decor is like every other Cafe Rio out there. Vibrant and friendly. A comfortable fun place to have a meal.  The staff is fast and friendly. The menu takes a little getting used too, but the staff are helpful.  We ordered a sweet pork barbacoa enchilada plate and a sweet pork barbacoa burrito plate. Both with mild sauce. The food was delicious. It was hard to stop eating my burrito even after I knew I had eaten too much. The burrito plate is large and could feed two people (maybe).  We will definitely be back (repeatedly) to try out all of the other dishes."}
{"text":"You tell me how a single taco (pulled pork) could cost $7. Yeah, I couldn't understand that either.   In the menu, I saw 3 tacos advertised for $8. I was hungry so I ordered 4 tacos. They charged me 3 tacos for $10 and $7 for the forth taco. No, I didn't put guacamole or anything extra on any of my tacos.   And worst of all, I am still hungry after the meal. The tacos weren't filling at all! (I'm only 145 lbs. It's not like I must eat a whole lot to be full.)  My suggestion to you is this: Don't to go this place. Go to a genuine taco shop instead. I think this place is overpriced for some really lame tacos that aren't even filling. Try places like Taco El Gordo and you'll never think about coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio but this location is awful. They are always out of something chips, queso, rice, etc. The employees always seem to have an attitude. Sometimes they don't even use gloves when making your meal. They always forget to put my tortilla strips on my salad. The music playing has swear words in it- blasting the N word and B word. Overall a terrible location and changing my view on Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"The food is great, it's a very popular restaurant but they have to find a more affective way of organizing the line.  Every time I go there I have to wait at least 30 minutes to place my order. So I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you were trying to find a \"quick\" bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Well, they sure try. As I try to think this is good Mexican food, I just can't . There are many better places, especially in Az. It may be okay out of state where the choices are few."}
{"text":"So, I went back to try the steak. It was awesome! I also had a bite of the grilled chicken and it was incredible, as well. I have to go back and try the flan... rumor has it, it's award winning!  Great alternative to Chipotle!"}
{"text":"So I heard from friends this pace is so good, I decided to give it a try. I was probably 10th in line and was waiting a good 30 minutes in line, several times I told myself just leave other times I said I want to know what the hype was about. Finally get up there and I order the barbacoa burrito enchilada style. I'm skiing the guy how do I order because this is my first time here, let's just say he rolled his eyes and was annoyed I was asking questions. The food looked great. I sat down a dug in my burrito. It was the most disgusting  burrito I ever had, it tasted like I put a spoon full of sugar in my mouth. Last time I checked Mexican meat doesn't taste like that. I'll never come back again. I'll stick to authentic Mexican food/restaurants"}
{"text":"The food at Cafe Rio is good, very good. The atmosphere is nice and well executed, and feels kinda indie and cool for a chain restaurant.  However, The place is always packed and the service staff is probably one of the rudest staffs I've encountered. I've probably eaten there 20 times in the last year. and I have only ever had one friendly experience with staff, they hate giving suggestions or answering questions about the food.  It's rather frustrating. The staff at similar restaurants that are just as busy in the area are quite a bit friendlier and open to giving suggestions and answering questions.  I made the decision not to return a few months ago due to the long wait to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"And I thought Chipotle was kinda pricey! This place is even more, and with half of the meats at an extra surcharge. Sorry but I don't think chicken should be a dollar more on an already almost $8 burrito.  BUT, oh man the chile beef is so tender. And I love the handmade right-in-front-of-your-eyes flour tortillas. I want that rotating tortilla cooker! I like how you only get meat, rice and beans in your tortilla and then lettuce and pico on the outside. It's nice if you prefer your hot food to stay hot and your cold food to stay cold. But I do miss the corn salsa from Chipotle, and I think their salsas are better there too. But I like how at Rio your burrito gets put through a toaster thing, but this holds up the line.  I also notice they put a lot more meat in the burrito than Chipotle, but then again, prices are higher. The guy in front of us ordered steak and they put a shit ton of it in there. The most popular seems to be the barbacoa pork, which we tried, and didn't like. It's way too sweet, but most Americans seem to like everything on the sweet side.  I've been to both the locations in Centennial, and I like this location better. They don't charge for the creamy tomatillo sauce, in fact they gave us two. The other location across from In N Out on Centennial Pkwy charges for it. Also the Decatur location gave us three stamps on the stamp card for some reason for getting two burritos, and the other location gave us one.  Enchilada style is not really needed, as there is a lot of salsa and cheese on the inside already, and you'll be adding on another buck for that extra splash of salsa verde on top.  I'd definitely give this place more stars if not for the high price."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this location and it's was awesome. The employees were so nice and having so much fun with guests.  It's so refreshing.  I usually go to  the Eastern and Serene which I hate that i do because they are awful and nasty and that's being nice.  This location will definitely get my business over Eastern.  This location should train others."}
{"text":"After waiting in line all out of tortillas then 30 minutes later at cashier they didn't have full order we were missing one of our entrées so now we have to wait 12 minutes for them to cook steak that they ran out of   Apparently they need some new Managment and more employees this is a on going problem here we have had several different problems on many visits"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the fast food Mexican restaurants but the food here was really good. Stopped in with my son and tried the spicy pork with habanero sauce burrito. It was the perfect spice and I like spicy! The customer service behind the counter was great. The kids behind the counter really impressed me!"}
{"text":"I really like the food.  Housemade tortillas and fresh ingredients!  Portions are quite generous and service was pretty friendly.  What I do not like: sneaky upcharges.  I ordered the pork barbacoa last night and when asked if I wanted my hot sauce \"enchilada style,\" I said yes.  I mean, the more sauce the better, right?  Well, apparently spooning extra sauce over a burrito is hard work that equals a dollar.  Yup, getting your burrito \"enchilada style\" will cost you a buck.  I only learned that upon reading my receipt.  Apparently, there are other upcharges, like requesting sour cream, guac, etc.  I'm guessing that any innocuous question posed by a staff member hides an upcharge.  Just say no, kids.  Or, buyer beware.    Also keep in mind that if you're a hands-on type of eater, you may have to develop knife and fork skills to eat here.  Not a dealbreaker in my book, but may be a shock to some folks!  3* for sneakiness."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Río this place is an amazing tex-mex type restaurant definitely not an authentic Mexican joint, anyway back on topic I love this place shredded chicken burrito enchilada style with hot sauce is hands down the best meal you could get! Amazing service, plus the staff is very kind."}
{"text":"I don't even know why i would give this place more than one star, because it's got to be the worst cafe Rio in town...almost always they get something in my order wrong...the last time I was here I got the quesadilla...while it tasted fine, it was poorly 'constructed' I mean there was barely any cheese in there and the steak was all clumped up in the same area...and the worker doing the griddle for the quesadilla just seemed like she didn't wanna be there the way she was making the food, she was even mean to her own co-workers, with a 'don't talk to me' attitude towards them...better find another cafe Rio if you're around this area"}
{"text":"I tend to like more traditional Mexican food and the first couple times I went here I wasn't that impressed, but I have so many friends that love Cafe Rio I gave it one more chance.  It was that day that I discovered the Pork Barbacoa, and when I did the clouds parted as rays of sunshine poured down on me while harps lightly played.  Really, it's THAT GOOD!  Since then I've had the pork in a salad, in a burrito, and my favorite, in the enchiladas.  As far as the other meats, they're good but not outstanding, and the service is just average, nothing stellar but not bad either.  It also can get very crowded, but the pork is worth it all!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and while the food is awesome every time and I'm glad that I went there, the customer service is very random.  At times, the staff is friendly with a smile on their face and making jokes.  But at other times, they are rude, they make it seem like you are bothering them and they seem more concerned about talking to each other than to you.  Then you get down to pay and the cashier is either on it and understands what you ordered, or you basically need to spell it out.  So be prepared for great food with bipolar customer service."}
{"text":"This location is ok. They often get your order wrong because they're not paying attention, and miscommunicate which can cause you to get the wrong order. I'd recommend watching your order closely from beginning to end to make sure they didn't accidentally switch it with someone else's.  Other than that, the usual goes for this location as compared to other Cafe Rios. You basically choose from a small menu of items: burritos, tostadas, salads, nachos, tacos; and then choose your veggies and toppings. I usually go with the pork tostada w/ no tortilla/rice, black beans, veggies, and house dressing.  The line always long if you come during prime lunch and dinner hours! Sometimes the line is literally to the door!"}
{"text":"I had exceptional service from Caesar and always enjoy talking to him when he is working.  Most times the rest of the staff does a great job on giving good portions and moving the food making process quickly.  Very delicious food and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cafe Rio about a dozen times at least. The staff is always amazing and the food is wonderful every time we go.   But the cleanliness of the facility has been going down steadily with each visit. More specifically, the bathrooms are horrible. On my most recent trip, the toilet paper was empty, there were paper towels covering the floor, and the soap dispenser was broken. Also, I wish there were a place to hang my purse when I am in the restroom.   Friday nights are a zoo: go on Wednesdays for lunch ;)."}
{"text":"Great location. Outside seating and the food is great as always! The people serving the food are nice, friendly and they work fast! The line was wrapped around when we walked in, but the line never stopped moving. Good choice, anytime."}
{"text":"For us this is one of those places you go to when you have a one favorite food.  We go there for the sweet pork enchiladas.  When you order with double meat - they can't be beat!!!  The 5 stars is for the food only.  The rating drops down a bit in other areas (friendliness of staff, cleanliness, etc)."}
{"text":"What's the appeal? Even after turning down my snob dial, plus being excited for the vegan beans and rice, the taste was just too \"off\" for me.  Granted, the dining area is large and the queue is fast, and the prices are fair, but everything had a heavy, processed taste.  By \"everything\" I mean the beans/cheese/rice burrito and a pair of cheese enchiladas. The burrito (2/3 left unfinished) was a mass of funky beans with very little else going on. (The advertised peppers and onions and whatnot were just a floppy sprinkle on the side. The cheese and rice was almost non-existent. And it sure didn't taste like the advertised cotija.) The enchiladas were better, but \"less offensive\" doesn't equal \"good.\"  Disappointing, and I'm probably being swayed by the idea of Cafe Rio more than the actual experience to even give it two stars. Yes, the menu is more varied than Del Taco and Taco Bell, but the taste is almost the same... on a good day."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here and the food tastes so good every time! Either get the burrito or salad and by the end of it I'm always full. Shredded chicken enchilada burrito is probably my favorite but today decided to go with their huge salad. House dressing is bomb too with the salad."}
{"text":"The service at this location is the absolute worst.  The Rudest staff and completely messed up the order on purpose.  We asked for the smothered burrito And the sever rolled her eyes as if it was Completely putting her out. Get a new job if you don't like this one. All the items we ordered with no cilantro, she put extra cilantro on everything. Lunch was about $80 and this is the treatment we get.  Nasty attitude all the way around.  Skip this place!!"}
{"text":"New location, new staff so they still have to work out some kinks with their ordering system and that's fine. The food is good but it's not worth what they charge. I'm shocked that they charge extra for \"house dressing\" ? They also charge extra if you would like sour cream on top of your $9.00 burrito! It's a fast food place and in my opinion your sauces, dressings and sour cream should not cost extra.   I paid the $1.00 for their house dressing expecting it to be worth all one hundred pennies, but it wasn't!"}
{"text":"This location has by far the worst service. Everytime we go the food is all spilling over into the other bins and it looks so unsanitary and the service just is awful. We only go here out of convenience of where it's at but after tonight we had to walk out before ordering. We waited for 10 minutes and watched all of the employees laugh and hang out and make their OWN FREE food, then when we asked if we could order they said no because they were busy. I've never seen such unprofessionalism from such a large franchise. It sucks because we like cafe rio but the food and service quality is so embarrassing to their name. I recommend that a manager or someone higher up come in anonymously and experience first hand what a horrible job the staff at this location does."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute nightmare. Staff is rude, management lies, and they never make anything correctly. Plus I've been there multiple times when they are just plain out of stuff. I've never been to a more ill run restaurant in my life."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is my \"go to\" restaurant.  This is my favorite location in the valley.  They are always very friendly and fast.  The tostada is my usual because it is basically a small salad. Great gift card deals every black Friday and they have a punch card where every 10th meal is free!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed! This is one of my go-to's. Their salads are totally worth the money - one is enough for two meals or two people to share. The chips and queso is soooo good if you're looking to splurge. It's also enough to share - one serving will serve 2+ people.   Make sure to get their stamp card!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is always so crowded, maybe just because it's new. I got $10 credit from the app and decided to give them a try.   First of all the guy preparing my enchiladas put the wrong sauce on but I didn't say anything. Then the dish goes through a moving oven, like at Quiznos or a pizza place.   The dish was very bland, the tortillas weren't cooked through and the way it was prepared was just overall sloppy.   At least it was free"}
{"text":"I've eaten at probably 10 different Cafe Rios in the chain across NV and UT, and this is by far the worst location.  They are not friendly at all, always run out of things, make things wrong (I have to tell them how it's supposed to be made.)  If you have 10 extra minutes, drive to the S. Eastern location."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual but service was extremely terrible. Normally the staff is friendly and polite, i don't know what it was, maybe because they were near closing but the staff was inattentive and the cashier left in the middle of nowhere for a couple minutes and she had her headphones in as if it was no big deal! Not satisfied if you ever want to come make sure its not towards closing."}
{"text":"Maybe I just went at a bad time but to me it seems like the girl who made my order was in a huge hurry to wrap up the burrito and forgets to ask if I wanted anything else in it. The chicken seems as though it has been sitting a while seeing it was as dry as my dogs treats..... Overall not satisfied AT ALL. One of the worst cafe rio locations I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I recently had Cafe Rio for the very first time......omg. The salad bowls are bomb. We need one in the bay."}
{"text":"If everyone that worked here didn't act/looked like they hated their lives their rating wouldn't be so low because their food is always the best. Their queso is delicious so is the house cilantro and all of their food is always fresh and yummy. But I haven't had good service more than fingers on my hand I go here 1-2 times a week. I get fast food isn't the greatest to work in but I've had workers literally throw my food around and roll their eyes at me when I ask for the bigger cup of dressing for my tostadas. Serious attitude checks are in need at this place otherwise, great place."}
{"text":"HOMEMADE TORTILLAS...these have changed my life. THey make them right there in front of you. I'm making my way through the menu but so far my favorite is a salmon salad on top of a big warm fresh tortilla. Fresh ingredients and always delicious. The staff is super friendly and its a great value for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Walking in at first was somewhat empty thinking \"oh how lucky don't have to wait\". Reasons why I will never go back....1. Blond lady up front no customer service, no greeting just what can I get you. My rice was pretty much thrown into the bowl, I asked what there shrimp looked like was given an attitude. 2. Barbacoa so sweet i tasted more of the sauce than the meat. 3. Screaming for food while speaking under her breath \"fuck I always have to repeat myself\" really I can hear you. 4. The lady prepares my food with the wrong lettuce as I'm paying I brought up it's be wrong one, she says with the rudest voice \"you could of told her while she was preparing your food\" really ? I responded \"if it's that big of a deal then I will take it\". Nope grabbed it and threw it in the trash. Stating \"now we have to make a new one\". Just shocked on how they don't see that they indeed need are customers elsewhere and if they receive poor treatment they would not appreciate it much....I will give someone else my business who has a different belief on customer service, never here again."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch the place was just starting to get busy. The first thing I noticed is it appeared clean but when you really started to look I was able to see dirt, food and small garbage on floor.   Next i noticed they made their own tortillas. A definite plus. I ordered the Spicy green Chile pork burrito served enchilada style. I also liked that besides the normal fountain drinks ie. sodas they had lemonade,  2 kinds of limeade and horchata.  I would recommend this place, but it might be helpful if they clean the floor before opening!"}
{"text":"SLOWEST LINE EVER. Stood in line for 20 minutes, and they managed to move through 4 people. The line was ridiculously long, but there were only 2 tables seated and eating. Ended up giving up and going next door."}
{"text":"We visited this location a few weeks back. Not only did we wait almost 2 hours to order, the staff was rude, unorganized and not apologetic at all. Food was backing up on the conveyer oven. When the party in from of me mysteriously no longer had their nacho order it was discovered by the patrons that they had fallen off the conveyer and fallen to the floor. This of course backed up the line even more. No apologies, offers for compensation just blank faces and yelling to have the poor girl at the front of the line remake the nachos. It was clear this location needs mass improvement on their training, communication and ability to handle a large crowd. We will not be returning to this location again and I hope they can get it together before they lose more business. Mind you we drove from NE Mesa to dine here and it was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I frequent this place weekly and have been very disappointed for about a month. The rice has consistently been overcooked and they NEVER have chocolate flan. I normally come for lunch and would be surprised that it is sold out before noon each time I go in.   Will continue to come in as I really enjoy the tortillas, grilled chicken and black beans."}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes in line for queso. We told the first employee in the line that's what we were waiting for and he said someone else would help us. We waited 5 more minutes and someone asked what we were waiting on. I told her we needed 2 orders of queso. She said they were out and began helping the next person. I spoke with a manager at the cashier line and he said they didn't make any this morning, sorry.  I told him we waited for 20 minutes and that's why we were there. Again, sorry. I told him we would not be back. He responded \"ok\" and walked away. Terrible customer service and complete lack of any kind of respect. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican American joint. Lots of college kids and there were cops eating there so the clientel was kinda gross, plus fuck las vegas metro. ugh. Food was perfectly fine though and I would go there again."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst location! The lines are depressingly dragging and the staff is extremely unfriendly and lazy. Every time I've gone in, called in to order, or ordered online there has been a mistake with my meal. I don't even know why I bothered with my last call in order (Jan. 28, 2015). The store has been open for several months now, you'd think they'd have their act together. If I could give zero stars I would. Please save yourself the annoyance and hassle and go to literally any of the other Cafe Rio locations."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this location because the service is terrible and the make line is dirty. I usually drive all the way to the Camelback and 20th St. location.  I love the shredded chicken salad though, it is amazing!! I would say the food is a better version of Chipotle. The service at this Lake Pleasant location is also not the best. I was ignored at the take out line by an employee who was standing right in front of me.  Although I was really excited about how close this location is to my house, I'm definitely dissatisfied with the customer service and overall cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They catered for my wedding shower and I had so much food it was so taste and they did an amazing job!  I like to come here each time they have a taco special! Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!"}
{"text":"I placed a web order @ 11:00am for a pickup time of 11:30am. It is now 11:40am and they've just begun to prepare my order. As soon as I arrived there were four employees at the counter, whom failed to even acknowledge my presence. Completely unacceptable customer service."}
{"text":"Everyone thinks I'm looney tunes but this is my favorite fast food Mexican EVER! My friends and co-workers won't eat here - they prefer Chipotle, but I am a Cafe Rio devotee all the way! Even my husband has nicknamed the place \"Cafe Shit\" but what does he know?  I've been eating Cafe Rio since discovering it in Utah in 2005 and their arrival in Vegas is long overdue.   Fresh tortillas are hot off the press- they're also brushed with butter and warmed on a stove with a little cheese, making the base for their salads. From there, everything from beans and rice to your choice of meat, cheese chips, guac etc. PILED to make a mountain of salad. And their tomatillo dressing is out of this world delicious. I seriously think I could drink the stuff!  I always order the shredded chicken as I think the fire-roasted chicken is too dry and the pork barbacoa is very sweet.   My kids also order salads, which is very unusual for my boys. They're that good.  They also have Diet Dr. Pepper.  You can call your order in and pick it up, thus avoiding the long lunch/dinner line. I wish they had a drive-thru like the one in Cedar City."}
{"text":"Came here and they were out of steak and pork. The lady was super rude about it too. Their lettuce was wilted and the place smelled like a portable potty."}
{"text":"This was my first time here but my mom has been before. There was a long line but it was Mother's Day so it was expected. You do have the option of ordering online. We watched them make the tortillas fresh as we waited (yummy). The staff was friendly and our order was accurate and delicious. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Cafe Rio a whole lot unless people from work drag me along. This time we were in the area during work and they wanted to stop by. The food was fresh and the service was fast even though there was a line forming when we arrived.   I ordered a chicken burrito and it gets toasted in the oven after it's filled with chicken, beans and rice so it's nice and warm when you get it. The hot sauce was good too and had a decent kick to it. I would come here again if I were in the area.   Don't forget to get your rewards card stamped too, because I always forget to carry it with me. After 10 stamps you'll get a free meal!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The staff makes it seem like you are inconveniencing them when you try to order. I have been here a few times and I will say this is my last time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times recently and every time it's been a similar story. Before I get into that, I'll say that I personally prefer Costa Vida to Cafe Rio (they're sister companies) but that's more of a loyalty thing than anything else.  The food is good. The pork is amazing, everything tastes fresh, the tortillas are homemade. All positive things.  The service at this location leaves something to be desired. It's not that the employees are necessarily rude, but their English is difficult to understand. Normally I wouldn't complain about this at all, but 50% of the reason for this is that the barrier between the employees and customers is RIDICULOUSLY high. I'm an average height and I have to stand on my tiptoes to communicate with the employees. That's not alright and it needs to be changed. If that small detail was changed I think the whole experience would be significantly better because we wouldn't have to repeat ourselves (both customers and employees) like ten times to be understood."}
{"text":"I was not a fan when this location first opened, it was horrible! Then came the new manager and this place has completely turned around! The workers are friendly, the food is always great, and they move the line fairly quickly.  Cafe Rio should reward the manager she turned one of the worst locations into the best!!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio but lately they skimp on the portion size. I'm willing to pay for extra, don't act all put out. You all need an attitude adjustment specifically the Stephanie location."}
{"text":"I just walked out of this establishment. I have worked in this industry for 7 years and I have never been treated as if my Buisiness did not matter. My Roomate had called in a Togo soup because she is feeling under the weather so I went to grab it for her... Show up and have been waiting 6 minutes before someone even acknowledges that I'm there. The girl (not sure of her name but she had awful skin completion) had helped me and told me I needed to wait 15 minutes longer for a BOWL OF SOUP!!!! I know a bowl of soup does not take 15 minutes to prepare. So I asked if because it was a soup if it would take less time and she said she would grab it and so I paid. Then she says I still have to wait... So instead of honoring her word of grabbing my soup I had asked for a refund. I will no longer be dining with cafe rio and I will no longer recommend them over chipotle as I have in the past."}
{"text":"I have now been to Cafe Rio three times wanting to have their tres leches dessert, and every time, they have been out. To me, it is a sign of poor management if you advertise having something on the menu but never make enough. The food is okay, but I would prefer Chipotle"}
{"text":"I have always been meaning too check this place out since one of my friends at work gave it a pretty good recommendation. I was in the area so figure why NOT. There were things that I liked about Cafe Rio and other things that just not impressed with or left without excitement of needed too come back again sooner then later.   The whole idea of fresh tortilla LOVE it!!! Too see one of the working just going too town with twenty of them cooking at the same time. Little show for free. The circle flat top spinning in circle for sure helps not only the cooking process but that way no need too be seven feet plus reach the ones in the back. Lol! Always fan of seeing ones tacos, burrito, enchilada, or salad put together in front of you. Also fan of getting too choose which toppings or ones feel do without on. I like the fact not only horchata (really good), more then your normal fountain drink options had two other flavors mint flavor and other one pink lemonade or something close too. The portion size is great deal for the price under ten dollars. I passed on the rice and beans with my two tacos (instead made it three taco lunch) added one more price you pay. Still went ahead ordered side of rice just cause wanted too try it. All the topping were very much fresh from the greens, salsa, and course the tortilla fresh, The thought of fresh fresh tortilla is worth star all by itself!!!  I felt like all my tacos short was on flavor. I had one beef and two chicken tacos. The beef was  more disappointed with then the chicken. The beef was nice moist BUT with total lack of flavor. I could not tell if it was slow braised in bbq or whatever it was in. Honestly just bland. The chicken was slightly better had nice grilled flavor but again lack identity or something. Rather bland chicken. The toppings helped out came too lack of flavors. Course the crispy fresh tortillas. Saving grace comes too tacos. Maybe need too order the enchilada next time.  Talk about packed if coming for lunch don't be surprised if little wait. Even then it moves along decent pace. Forgot add one more thing like the fact that have outdoor patio area. It no water show just the parking lot. Still on nice day and if the place is packed too the max. Nice option. I did! Perfect weather and the place was packed so made the most of it!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. It's pretty good. It's different then chipotle like what comes on and etc. I usually get the salad cause you get more stuff on it I believe. It's a tortilla with rice, your choice of meat, black or brown beans, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, guac, (no sour cream, it's extra) instead there's this sauce & it's good but I like it on the side. To top it off chips. Super delicious.   Meat options are grilled chicken, shredded chicken, beef, pulled pork & steak.   There is daily specials. Tuesday's there is $1 something per taco. They are soft tacos but a super delicious.   Download the cafe rio app and you get $5 when signing up. After getting 100 points you unlock $10 to use for food. Also on special days you get extra points if you buy something. They will notify you.   Also there is seating outside if you like."}
{"text":"This is my casual quick and cheap go to.  It tastes SO GOOD.  Always consistent. I don't like other places similar to this one. I order the pork burrito, no rice, with sour Cream, guacamole, and extra pico de gallo. The pork has a hint of sweetness. Everything tastes clean and well balanced. You can also get a stamp card of you frequent often. The one thing however I noticed last time.  The glass, the sneeze guard, was very dusty.  Should be mindful of that and clean often.  It's the one thing that customers are closest to and see right away. Everything else is pretty clean."}
{"text":"New decor, higher prices, smaller portions. Employees don't listen to you - turning your order into a mess (this was going through the line not the phone!) This location has turned to the dark side. I will be going to the Decatur location near Costco from now on."}
{"text":"First off, whats not to like?  Everything here is top notch.  The tortillas are freshly made, the service is refreshingly amazing and the food is awesome.  I have been to this cafe rio many a times and it always exceeds my expectations.  thats what it comes down to for me with service.... if you go to a place and they fail to meet your expectations or just barely meet them, you have to find somewhere new... but the freshness of the food and everything that goes into their preparation, you have to keep going back time and time again.  I would trust any cafe rio would do this for you...   proceed feeling assured that you are in good hands."}
{"text":"Food is very good! But the service is terrible! My second time coming here & the service has been bad. Too many workers that don't know what's going on & messing up people's orders. The place is packed, they should have their workers on top of things."}
{"text":"The food is great, great customer service, but the stupid app deals they offer are a scam. They say you get triple points when you spend $20 pre tax. But every time the pretax is 3 cents under the amount they say to spend. Bull shit. Don't use their app, and only visit once. Don't give them more money."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Ordered 2 meals and a drink over the phone. When I went to pick up only beverage was recorded on my order. Employee said they use a third party service for their phone orders and it's \"spotty at best\". Would never recommend calling in orders."}
{"text":"What's the point of a mobile order line if the guests in the main line are getting served first? Time go hire more employees. I have had several issues with this location and the employees seeming extremely overwhelmed. This isn't good for company morale, Cafe Rio. Get it together."}
{"text":"Have come here a few times and EVERY time its awful. The customer service is the absolute worst. You get treated with such disrespect and they don't care to listen to you. Completely unprofessional. There is never a smile on any of the employees faces, and should you ask them a question regarding your order its as if you are completely inconveniencing them. Their looks, gestures and words are so negative. Its a shame that the customer service is what ruins this locations reputation. If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio and I think that for their food they have a reputation hold. I was disappointed at this location, I feel like a lot of the employees do not care to be there and therefore have crappy service, they also don't have he fun atmosphere anymore, I remember the first time I went to Cafe rio they were always singing and yelling free meal or happy birthday or whatever, it seemed fun, this time it was like an assembly line and I even heard an employee complain that he doesn't get paid enough. They had run out of a few drinks on the fountain which I think is unacceptable for a restaurant as busy as they are, and then my food, my burrito had a whole Bullion inside of it it it was so salty I could no longer eat it. They did fix it by giving me another burrito. But I feel like this location needs more attention especially as busy as it is. The bathroom was also very dirty."}
{"text":"First thing I feel like saying is the price is outrageous. But, I decided to give it a try and this is what happened.  First, the line is long and moves slow. The menu is positioned on the sides so it's not exactly easy to read while waiting in line. I was reading the items and so I had my back to the direction of the line. But, I was still relatively close to the person in front of me and to my surprise, a well dressed woman ducked under the rails to cut in front of me. I was wondering if it was a joke but I asked her and she thought about it for a minute then allowed me and several people behind me go ahead. Strange but whatever...at least she owned up to it. So, onto the food.  I got a steak burrito and asked for it to be wet. Very small amount of steak and mostly rice and beans. She put a small amount of green salsa on it, wrapped it, a handful of cheese on top and threw it in the moving salamander. I watched as it sat in the holding bin for awhile. So many employees here that I don't know how anything would be sitting for more than 10 seconds, let alone much longer. Waste of employees. Then, they did not put enchilada sauce. I thought maybe these kids just didn't know what a 'wet' burrito is so didn't want to interfere with their ever so busy routine, ugh. But, no...they charged an extra dollar for an enchilada style burrito. Lame. Also charge extra for sour cream when the burrito itself is already 10 bucks?? Wow. Very overpriced. They must be killing it on the bottom line except with so many worthless employees that stand there to simply bag up my order and give me dirty looks the entire time they are doing it, I definitely won't be back.  Over priced. Can't get my order right. And basically a giant pile of rice and beans with a little side of meat.   Not friendly. Not clean ( trash was overflowing ). Not that tasty. And way overpriced for that dish.  Oh! And they charged it 'for here' when she gave me it in a bag to go! That adds tax to it. Cheap!!"}
{"text":"There was one positive, the young guy with blue hair and neck tattoos was nice and trying to do his job, and the tall young gal that was working next to him. No name tags so who knows there names. Everyone else seemed to move at a snails pace and not give a crap. First there were two phoned in/emailed orders that were large and being placed ahead of ours. So we literally stood at the window watching our food just sit there for close to 10 minutes. They need to get a quicker system or give customers that are actually there priority.  Don't let the food just sit. Second, I was able to see a lot going on while I had to just stand waiting. An order of nachos had sour cream on it and they didn't want anything on it apparently,  and you would think it was a good thing they caught a mistake before it went out. However the person that seemed to be in charge, pony tail and glasses, told the larger gal with curly hair to just scrape it off. So she did just that, and then covered up what she couldn't get off with more cheese, the proceeded to run back thru to melt. Hope there aren't any severe allergies that can cause someone to be really ill...all because your lazy and didn't do it right the first time. Then, while we are still waiting in the same spot at the end of the line just staring at our food sitting, a burrito fell off of the oven conveyor because another one came thru. But here's the thing, the second item didn't come thru and push it right off, it happened over a matter of minutes. And then when it fell, the sour cream gal announced it in a very \"oh well\" tone and NO ONE cared. It just sat on the floor. And sat. And sat... After the other orders were finally done, the cashier acknowledged us though we'd been standing there for somentime staring at her and everyone else at the end of the production line. And when she did get around to acknowledging us she said \"give me a minute\". Wow. You know how long we've been standing here, and all we've just seen and you speak to me like I'm bugging you. I also asked her for a side of beans and I thought her head was going to quiet literally explode from the audacity of my request. She was so put out by it.  Look, I didn't say anything because I was exhausted and only there because I didn't have the energy to cook for the family. And I knew that if I said something these people would have defended their crappy behavior because the one in charge was the same way. They just absolutely do NOT give a crap. About anything. I won't be going back because unfortunately this isn't the first time we've had to deal with this place clearly having poor management. Which is a shame, because there are some good people that are trying to do a good job, even if that kind of thing isn't encouraged."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is with this place, but personally I think it's alright, but everyone else I know and work with LOVE this place and because of that, I'm dragged over here every few months. Cafe Rio is kind of like an overpriced Chipotle, where you can order burritos, tostadas, etc and they'll make the food right in front of you. The meats seem kind of dry to me and the burritos are pretty plain..only meat, sauce and cheese...really? There is also no option on the menu to order just a bowl so I have to get the burrito. Did I mention it was dry? They do offer a stamp card so your meal is free after I believe 10 stamps. I never bring it in since I come here a handful of times a year. For the price at over 10 bucks for a burrito and small drink, I don't think it's that great of a place...I'll stick with my Chipotle any day"}
{"text":"When is this stupid \"Fresh Mex\" craze going to end?  How many more dime-a-dozen Americanized (read: bland) Mexican places do we really need?  Over a decade ago it was Baja Fresh... That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places.  Then a few years ago we got Chipotle.  And it was fun for awhile, but eventually you get sick of eating the same rice-saturated burrito over and over and over again.  Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places.  I wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable (on rare occasions).  Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner.  Anyways, I had their \"special\" pork barbecoa (or whatever they call it), and it was pedestrian, at best.  It did not taste natural; sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet.  It's supposed to be nice and smoky.  It's supposed to taste like meat.  This place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture.  No heart, no soul, and large portions.  It doesn't matter what it tastes like, as long as it fills your stomach, right?  Cafe Rio is possibly the worst offender; I think I would rather eat at Qdoba or Costa Vida."}
{"text":"The expansion flywheel is spinning at Café Rio.  This Salt Lake City based (fast) casual Mexican restaurant chain is all over the Valley and Western half of the US, stretching as far north as Montana.  Similar to Chipotle with markedly different flavor profiles, the usual suspects are present, burritos, taco, and salads. Hand made tortillas are created at the beginning of the production line so the freshness is evident. They are particularly known for their sweet pork and its worth trying, albeit a little rich.  The salad with the house dressing is excellent and I love that they offer fresh cilantro as a topping.   They have a great app to track purchases and gain rewards although be careful with the notification settings or they'll blow your phone up.    Terrific daily specials, highlighted with,  you guessed it, Taco Tuesday.  $1.95 tacos and for a couple of saw bucks more you can layer on rice and beans and a drink.  They have a great selection of fountain and aerated Hispanic style drinks including horchata, one of my favorites.  The food definitely  deserves a four star rating, whoever designed the menu is very good at what they do.  Here's the issue.  When you walk in you'll see a \"customer corral\" to snake your way through the line.  This is their way to offset their inability to get you quickly through the line.  This place (and the chain in general) takes forever.  \"Fast\" causal eating establishment moniker does not apply to Café Rio.  I really enjoy the food but they are fast exhausting their fan bases' patience with the long lines when there is no need for it.  It's time to grow up and call in some experts, I'd strongly recommend some six sigma process experts to fix your service and production issues  before you're reduced to serving snowbirds with all the time in the world on their hands yet eat like birds that split a taco and drink.  What you really want is the soccer mom with a mini-van full of kids. Best of luck, I really want to support you but my time is valuable."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the salads!  Although it's probably not entirely healthy since it's layered with a tortilla, beans, rice, cheese, and tortilla chips.  All other ingredients (lettuce, salsa, cilantro, dressing, and guac)  I feel are considered healthy since you can find them on traditional salads.  I like how they have an open kitchen so you can watch them make their tortillas while standing in line.  I'm always fascinated by small creations like this. I also enjoy how fast they are.  Even if there is a long line when you walk in, you'll find yourself sitting and chowing down in no time.  They have a great selection of drinks, my personal favorite is their mint limeade! They also switched to a new app system to track your purchases, instead of their previous stamp card.  What was awesome for my previous experience is the timing of the switchover from the stamp card to the app.  I had about 7 stamps on my card and didn't know of the app change until I got there.  I was hoping they would still be honoring the cards until people were able to complete their 10 purchases, which they did in a way!  They cashier saw that I was close enough to the 10 and gave me my meal for free, but just prompted me that I needed to download the app from here on out.  Such a kind man!"}
{"text":"Finally there's a Cafe Rio near my place!  Whenever my boyfriend and I get the craving we either have to drive to Chandler or Gilbert, which are both just a bit too far to go out for food, so we were extremely excited when we saw the banner for Cafe Rio go up near our corner.   Once opened, I finally went in to check it out.  It was late at night, near closing, so I expected most of the food to be packed up and ready to close for the night.  Although they had most of the items organized and semi packed up, it was easy for them to access things for last minute customers like myself.  Which is great because I didn't have to wait long! The employees are newer staffed so I was a bit more patient with them than normal. I told the server multiple times that I wanted everything on my salad except cilantro, and yet he still proceeded to ask me if I wanted X ingredient for each step of the way during his salad making process.  It got a bit annoying that he asked me every single time he was moving onto a new ingredient, and I answered him each time \"yes, everything but cilantro\"  but eventually I just gave up and responded yes.  I figured he might be tired from working a long shift and just wasn't hearing me properly.   The Tempe location is smaller than the Chandler and Gilbert location.  There is a smaller dining room, so I can imagine this place getting pretty packed during lunch and dinner hours.  But luckily since it's near our apartment, I just see ourselves getting our meals to go!"}
{"text":"Love Cafe Rio, have for years. HOWEVER, this location has the worst customer service. The workers are too busy goofing off & talking to each other when they should be listening & talking to the customers. Been to this location three times & each time they skimp on my order & flat out forget to put all the ingredients on my orders. Top it all off they overcharge for things & it takes forever for the cashier to do her job as well.  I no longer go to this location. I'll spend the extra gas and go to the one in Centennial Center or W. Sahara. Management don't be surprised when this Lake Mead store goes belly up if you don't get some trained and mature employees."}
{"text":"Often times I go into Cafe Rio because of Cafe Rio member reward that is automatically loaded in my account. I feel like I should use it or lose it.   Tonight I got the Chicken Tostada with lettuce, cheese, cilantro, and salsa. As I walk up to food serving station for young lady to take my order, I noticed she is cleaning half of food buffet for tonight's closure. I try to disregard this because I understand their filling slow time and getting ahead of closing duties. I then look over the choices of food to notice the black beans and/or pinto beans look dry and as if they have been sitting there beyond the allowed time without anyone tending to them. I picked black beans as they are always safe bet.. I wanted shrimp but they were out of it and no one offered to make it fresh.. so I went with Spicy Chicken, which looked okay. She loaded up my tostada with chicken and some cheese then it went through the convention oven. I then opted for the toppings that sound good to me. I did not realize all these toppings would make my tostada soggy! I am not happy with my selection tonight or cleanliness of the restaurant.   I do understand that restaurants get busy but I do see opportunity to clean as you go therefore it does not look so unpresentable toward the later evening. I saw multiple buckets/rags around the food and just sitting out. As I was leaving one employee was clocking out and noting how many hours she worked.. I don't believe this professional behavior in front of customers.   I did not enjoy my meal as the Tostada was soggy underneath all the toppings, it was basically like salad with soggy tostada. The chicken did not taste flavorful and the rice lacked any seasoning. My tostada had LOT of  big chucks of romaine lettuce and various other toppings so basically it was salad.     This is probably my 4 visit to this location over several months and I have to say I will not be back even with another loyalty reward. I would urge if your going to visit this location maybe when it first opens for fresh selections and cleanliness of restaurant."}
{"text":"2 meals and 2 drinks for $30 and the food was very, very...ok. Overpriced for a burrito bowl with VERY little meat. If you're itching for some Mexican food, Chipotle is far better."}
{"text":"Hi there just wanted to express the terrible experience my boyfriend had in this location today. He walked up to order didn't get a hi how are you how's your day just a what do you want. He proceeded to explain that we wanted two burritos. Didn't ask for anything crazy just wanted queso in one of the burrito. Didn't think it would be a big deal. She continued to huff and puff about putting queso in the burrito after that she just threw the burritos together extremely sloppy. Then as she continued to give attitude she threw the burritos to the checkout with out asking if we wanted lettuce or pico or anything else. I'm not sure who this employee is I know she was working the line at 1:30 today. We love the food but today your employees really let us down."}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive. Over 20 dollars for one burrito and a plate of nachos? I didnt even get drinks!! (Nachos claimed to be for 4-6 people but was barely enough for 2!) Get real. And it tastes like any other mediocre Mexican restaurant. Plus they charge for sourcream. ...really?? Thanks, but no thanks Cafe Rio. I'll stick with Chipotle."}
{"text":"A few friends and I put in an order online. I am allergic to cilantro so we called this location ahead of time to see what does and doesn't include cilantro. My friend made it very clear that I have a cilantro allergy and we were told that it was a \"side\" item and is only included if we asked for it. We specifically asked about both the rice and the pico (which are both made with cilantro), and were assured that neither included it. We went ahead and placed our order and under my order I put in all caps NO CILANTRO just in case.   One of my friends left right away and drove 20 minutes to pick up the food and not only did they not have the Mexican Coke that they had on the website to order, guess what was smothered all over my food! Lots of pico with lots of cilantro! And the rice actually does not come without cilantro (like at Chipotle, where you can choose to have rice with or without the lime cilantro), like we were promised.  My friend called back and mentioned the first phone call about the cilantro content in the food, and asked what could be done about it. No offer of a refund, partial or otherwise, and they re-did the order. Friend makes the 20 minute drive back to the location and brings back my food. Mixed into the lettuce is MORE CILANTRO.   Not only could they not follow directions (twice), the food was not fresh, no Mexican Coke even though it was available to order on the site (Note: the Mexican Coke was priced $2.29, and the 20 oz fountain cups we got in place of them were supposedly the same price), the nachos and quesadilla were super soggy, the guac was black, and my friend had to remind them to give him his change.  NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"Their setup is pretty similar to chipotle. Food quality is pretty decent. I got their vegetarian burrito enchilada style which is basically a burrito with double rice, beans, and guacamole with mild enchilada sauce on top (with no extra charge which is nice). Pretty good veggie option for vegans and vegetarians in the area. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I love this location. They are super friendly and my kids love the quesadias. I love the tres leches cake and the chicken tostada with a flour shell. Awesome lunch."}
{"text":"Brown, old watery guacamole.  Dirty food displays.  All salsas had skins on them.  Ordered the salad and the gal put 9 limes on the salad.  The pork container had lettuce and chunks of what not floating in it.  I would pass on this one. . ."}
{"text":"The way the shift lead or lead woman spoke was horrible. I came in to pick up a postmate order. On the app it told me to order the customers food. After beginning my order the guy making it was super nice and very helpful, where it went downhill was when the lead, a girl of mixed decent, asked me what the customers name was. I told her, and she gave the other workers a look and then told me she had already made it in an exasperated tone. I said I sorry but the app had told me to order and not pick up, I then showed them all the screen. She then walked away and another employee told me I could pick it up at the other counter. As I was paying for the order, she loudly says to the people behind me \"do you want these burritos? I'll give them to you for free.\" They way she spoke made me feel as though everything was a bother to her, and I don't appreciate the tone. If you don't like working there, find somewhere else to work."}
{"text":"3 stars cause the food is really good but this location has some issues. Consistently out of either ice , their fountain drinks, and today I got 5 bucks back in quarters,dimes , and nickels. No big deal on the change but was also out of a lot of their hot sauces they are known for. I love the fact they offer unique fountain drinks and hot sauces but damn, they can't keep it stocked it seems. Food is consistently good if not excellent."}
{"text":"Worse cafe too I been too. Unfriendly employees, line took forever with one guy doing everything.  I've been to numerous  cafe Rios and this by far is the worse experience so far. Other then the girl in the front not listening to anything or making a salad correctly, I understand if your new but damn train your employees . The food wasn't even good either after waiting in line so long."}
{"text":"Kids under six eat free, thats def a positive. Its just a small quesadilla but hey, its better than nothing.  came here with high expectations, and i think i was a little let down  i had no clue what to order and i asked the guy (near the tortillas?) and he shrugged. Real big help buddy! Then i asked which of their salsa was the most popular and he said all. Okay, obviously i wasnt getting far so i just chose a burrito with barbacoa.   In all honesty, it was WAY too sweet. All the barbacoa Ive had in the past had more of a spicy flavor. Even my friend with me said it was way too sweet and shes an avid Rio junkie.   I think i would have given them two stars if it wasnt for the wide variety in lemonade and the whole kids get a free quesadilla. I didnt feel anything special customer service wise. I get I came during lunch rush on sunday, 12:30pm but help me when i ask what to eat!  I will add I did try my friends salad and it was delicious. Will try them again and next time get that."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but sadly it didn't live up to the hype. One would expect a $10 burrito to be a \"stick to your ribs\" kind of meal... turns out they just stick it to ya! My meal was basically a hollow tortilla with a scant amount of rice, beans, and pork barbacoa. I really wish I had taken a photo of my underwhelming, flat excuse for a burrito, as it was literally half the size as advertised. Left disappointed and still hungry."}
{"text":"It's our favorite go to place after church with the family, fast delicious fresh food before hitting our Sunday errands. The Nino Quesadillas are perfect for the little ones! I love to mix the mint lemonade with a dash of strawberry!  love it!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I'm a Texan so I'm always skeptical when my Vegas relatives suggest Mexican food. :) The portions were big and delicious! Also the cheese dip and salsa were amazing!"}
{"text":"- Black cilantro. Couldn't eat it. Fyi that means it's bad! - Extra for sour cream and guac? Fine... but don't advertise on the menu that it comes with both on the menu! - Finally kid behind counter sighing and rolling his eyes who wasn't focused on work. He either needs a break or needs to be educated on open kitchen behavior. My previous Chef would have fired me for acting the way he did.  Unimpressed, mostly because of the rotting (not bruised) cilantro. Never going back."}
{"text":"Once again I was \"wowed\" by the service at MY local Cafe Rio.  Even though I didn't go to the gym today like I normally do before I visit, I ordered double fire grilled chicken on my salad.  AWESOME!!!  You know you go a lot when they remember exactly how you like different dishes.  Service, food, location all equal a great adventure.  A local favorite and recommended to everyone I meet that are new to the area."}
{"text":"Sweet BBQ pork burrito is delicious! Do I need to say more...?"}
{"text":"I can't seem to find my review that I made a while back where , i wrote  speaking about the great food but horribly managed operation. Well I am glad to know that  they have since Turned this place around and now not only is the food amazing, but the service is too.  Funny how just changing a manager to make a night and day difference.  I meant to get the managers name but I forgot, short thin guy, clean shaved, and knows how to manage!  If only every food establishment had a manager like this guy, it's really not that difficult I don't think but apparently some have a hard time putting the customer first.  Café Rio is my favorite again, thanks to whoever decided to make the change in the last few months (could've been longer, my perception of time is not very accurate sometimes)"}
{"text":"much better than chipotle"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding! On a Sunday night and it looked like they were short staffed but the orders were taken smoothly, accurately, and with a smile. These people were working hard. With that type of service, no one minded waiting in line. I love Cafe Rio's menu items. Salads, burritos,  tostada, always plenty, you could easily share with kids if on a budget but the prices are worth every bite. Large portions, fresh too. I love watching them roll out the torillas. Seeing all the fresh food, I know it is and it's good for me considering it's a fast food joint. I'm new to this location Blue Diamond/Las Vegas Blvd/Windmill Rd. Very nice area, very clean restaurant, very patient staff."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a Chipotle format Mexican place - but I prefer it.   You pick whether you want burrito/quesadilla/taco/salad, then they build it for you to your spec.  They even make the tortillas at a station you walk past while getting ready to order.  Generous portions, well seasoned - pretty good place to grab lunch or dinner. I'm currently a fan of the chile beef quesadilla!  One more thing - great staff - everybody is smiling and friendly and they appear to be making their jobs fun working with each other."}
{"text":"Not one employee seemed like they wanted to be there. Probably should rethink their career choices"}
{"text":"Third time giving this place a try. Same one star result all 3 times. Soggy tacos. Slow service."}
{"text":"My husband has picked up Cafe Rio about 6 or 7 times in the last year on his way home from work. Usually the chicken salad is great, the quesadilla is huge and the tacos are full of flavor but this time the salad missed its mark.  Clearly someone forgot that they were cooking chicken today because my chicken salad has several pieces of chicken that have 3rd degree burns. The char is serious on this poor bird. Extra sauce isn't helping, scraping off the char isn't working and it seems like my salad is going to have to go without its chicken friend today.   This is the first bad salad I've had from CF and I pray this doesn't happen again. Rest In Peace chicken, for tho weren't edible and died in vein! Lol"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio salads. Will never go to Chipotle again. Food is delicious here. Food rating, I'd give 5 stars. The sweet pork barbacoa is great and their new green chili pork is great too. It's a huge portion, full of flavor. I like getting mine with the wheat tortilla.   However, their service I would only give 3 stars. They just renovated this location and since then, their service has gone down. A few times I went and they'd be out of some things that go in the salad and because it was an hour before closing, they wouldn't make anymore. I'm not ok with that. They've also been out of there specialty drinks. It seems like they're always out of something.   I've also tried the order online and pick up there, but I've never had luck wirh them getting my order correct. Now I just go in and order it to go. This location gets super busy. I've waited in line for over a half an hour before. Be prepared for that, if you go during dinner time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, ordered through postmates and they forgot a burrito yet charged me for it but since the moron that works there couldn't figure it out, I am being charged with zero resolution. Cafe rio, good food but horrible service"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a plate of mouth watering nachos? Lets just say that I'm a HUGE nacho advocate and for some reason, even living in the South West part of the country it can be a challenging task for most restaurant owners to accomplish..   Not for Cafe Rio! Fresh meat (chicken is my preference), fresh corn tortilla chips, hand fulls of cheese, fresh guacamole, beans, and salsa equals a quick tap dance of happiness from me!  I sank my teeth into and wrapped my lips around some mighty tasty tortilla chips this afternoon on my lunch break. I must say my tin of nachos were by far the highlight of my day here at the sweat-shop.  The chicken tacos at Cafe Rio are equally delicious, especially since they are created within fresh (made before your eyes) tortillas.   My only *ugh* moment at this joint is when I get the lady that speaks faster than the speed of light and screws up my order by putting pico de gallo (chunky salsa) on my food instead of the medium, more blended salsa. Sounds minor but you'd be surprised at how a few extra tomatoes and the additional energy removing them from my dish can ruin my food mojo. Slow down lady! Speedy Spanglish equals messed up food orders, and crabby customers..just sayin.  It's worth the wait in line and the drama (sometimes) to park so if you're in the mood for extremely fresh and always delicious Mexican food, give Cafe Rio a whirl!"}
{"text":"Tried Cafe Rio today. It opened near work a couple of months ago and they haven't seemed to draw much business yet but I gave it a try.   I ordered a Spicy Pork Barbacoa Burrito (see pic).  Not very exciting and if that was the spicy version, the mild must be really boring.   They will need to step up their game to draw a crowd or they will go under. Perhaps a better menu on the website, more creative dishes and any level of enthusiasm in their crew, some creative sides, IDK."}
{"text":"A vendor brought us lunch at work today from Cafe Rio at the South Eastern location.   I had the rice and black bean burrito. The portion was huge and it was really really good! I planned on eating half of it, which all of the burrito ended up in my tummy. Everyone also said that their food was really good which was all types of salads, cheese quesadilla, sweet roasted pork burritos and etc....  I can't wait to try their catering service and actually going to the venue."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday right as they opened the doors at 11am. I was the second person in line to order our food. We always get grilled chicken  burritos and they didn't have any grilled chicken. So i ordered steak instead and they had no steak. I will say that i saw the steak and chicken on a cutting board ready to be cut up. The manager said the person that cuts the meat is late for work and won't be there for 25 minutes. What?!?! You cant cut some meat up?? Anyways, we got it with shredded chicken and it was horrible. There was so much water in my burrito from the juice of the shredded chicken.. it was so disgusting we didn't even eat it. I didn't get a receipt with my meal but i paid about $30 for 3 burritos, 1kids meal, a side of chips and two large drinks. I was just very disappointed with my whole experience. I called to talk to the manager and without a receipt  (that i didn't recieve) they couldn't do anything for me. What a joke"}
{"text":"Fire the store manager immediately! Went in at 6pm on a Friday- I understand it's going to be busy, after about a 15 minute wait to get our food- there was a 10 minute wait to pay! There was 1 group of people in front of me. The employees cannot handle any sort of group of people! New flash- there are 3 registers- why they don't use all 3 when the dinner crowd is beyond me! This group of 3 people held up the entire line to the point where everyone's food got cold- people where beside themselves angry!!   Then we sit down to find there is NO ICE- multiple people complained to the staff, and NO ONE tended to it. It took us 30 minutes to eat and the ice was still not filled, so thanks for the warm soda!  There were also no forks, it took 7 people asking for forks to get someone to come out and restock them!!   I will never go back, this location needs to clean house- hire an entire new staff!!"}
{"text":"I am sorry , we are cafe rio lovers... But this location is The worst!!! I will never go there again! This was my 2nd time.. They move like slow motion / unpleasant employees.. We went at about 730 after kids soccer.. Many kids from the team went .. And we frequent the Stephanie cafe rio all the time.. Guess they have us spoiled! This location NEEDS NEW MGMT!  No grilled chicken.. No iced tea.. A bone in my shredded beef tacos .. Everything was cold! This location needs serious help! Cafe rio needs to step in and get a new franchise owner here or something! I am so disgusted by the meal tonight! And like I said we eat cafe rio all the time .. This location does not deserve 1 star!"}
{"text":"Love it here food is fresh, staff is friendly.  I always try something new and haven't been disappointed yet.  I wish Cafe Rio had more restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on Tuesday, December 1. The tacos themselves were decent, we did like those. The problem we had with them is the fact that they dole out hardly any meat but a TON of toppings. I asked for a taco, not just toppings. This needs to change. But like I said, it was pretty tasty. However, the service is extremely slow. Luckily we were the only ones in line at the time we ordered so it wasn't so bad for us, but right after, a large crowd came in for the dinner rush and it was SO. SLOW. The poor guy was bombarded, and didn't have help, but he could have also worked faster! He was just slow in general and didn't seem to be pleased to be there nor did he want to work hard or any faster. He, and the restaurant itself, needs to step up their game or they will lose all business for good."}
{"text":"I've been to mutiple other Cafe Rios and always enjoy the food especially their tomatillo sauce which is highly addicting btw, but today I stopped in this location for lunch and it was a whole other level of Cafe Rio. It was extremely clean with super friendly staff that seem excited and passionate. Great vibe, fast service, very fresh tasting food...go check em out!"}
{"text":"I give this place \"no stars\" worst service ever. There were at least 6 people working. I was the ONLY customer. A girl finally takes my order, a burrito. She literally slapped the stuff into a tortilla, wraps it up and leaves it sitting while she goes off to do some other task with her coworkers while I wait at the cashier. I left without my food. Never again, this place is disgusting and dirty."}
{"text":"Been here many times. The food is spotty. Sometimes it's amazing (even though it only resembles mexican food) and sometimes it's blah.  The one constant is the horrible service and slow line. They always seem to mix up the order of the orders in line. The operation is a cluster. I want to go back there and help. Just writing about it makes me anxious and mad. Sloppy food prep, doesn't matter what you order because a little bit of everything else will be in your scoop. I'm done. Don't care how much my kids beg, there are too many better, cleaner, tastier, and MUCH FASTER options."}
{"text":"I ordered my food online, got there at the exact time when I was supposed to pick it up . And so the food was cold and all wet inside, seemed like it's been sitting there for a while , also I had ordered a side of guacamole and sour cream and it was not there . So ended up tossing the whole thing out cause it was gross . So disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the steak tacos which ended up being a mistake. They had little flavor and they didn't ask me if I wanted anything on it they just threw some lettuce and pico, which also had no flavor. There was no one line behind us and it seemed like they wanted to rush us through the line as fast as possible. My wife had the sweet pork tacos and she enjoyed them. I do not recommend the steak tacos, they are completely disappointing."}
{"text":"I'd read about this place before (on blogs written by people from Utah) so when I was driving down Baseline and hungry and saw it I decided to try it out.  It is set up a lot like Chipotle, however the process of ordering is somehow not quite as clear. Additionally I wasn't sure what went with my meal and what cost extra.  That aside the salmon tacos I got were really tasty. I don't think I've had salmon as the fish in fish tacos at a restaurant before and I enjoyed the change.  The price seemed a little high, but not so high that I won't visit again if I'm in Gilbert and looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"My neighbor recommend I go there and I had a great time. Their BBQ pork was awesome. My neighbor is here all the time and said so should I so I had to try it"}
{"text":"On June 15th, I put in a catering order, for pick up at 10:30 on June 22nd. On the 21st, I called to see if I could change my pick up time to 10:00.  I was told I didn't have an order. I emailed the copy of my order their catering department had sent me and life went on, my arrangement at that time was to pick up between 10-10:30. I walked in at 10:15 and was greeted by a woman waving me away saying, \"10 more minutes! 10 more minutes!\"  I told her I didn't have 10 more minutes. Another person stepped forward, explained I was picking up a catering order and helped me. I asked her to make sure everything was there, she assured me she had double checked and showed me where things were. She helped me load my car and was quite pleasant. Not everything was there. No sour cream, no guacamole. A taco bar with neither sour cream nor guacamole. I paid for it, I was told it was there...it just wasn't. I emailed the same email address I had sent my order to without response. Disappointing. The food was delicious, but their inability to communicate leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Food is always great buttttt...... I've seen them super busy.. tonight, they were not busy. I placed an order online to be ready for pick up at 8:30. Got here and paid by 8:32. It's been 20 minutes and I'm still waiting. I could've stood in the line and left 10 minutes ago. Frustrating when you have a little baby at home to get back to. What's the point of online orders?"}
{"text":"Such great food. Delicious salads!  The steak and sweet pork are my favorite. I have to say, the staff is downright mean.  It's like the soup guy in the Seinfeld episode. You better know what you want and be ready to yell it so they can hear you or they will bite your head off. I've been in line behind a newbie a few times who were basically brought to tears because they had questions. It's the same every time, really bad customer service and a lot of eye rolls. I endure it and try not to tick them off because the food is so good, I don't want to be kicked out.  A couple times I tried asking for shredded lettuce or light lettuce instead of the huge chunks they put on and they just stare you down while putting on the huge chunks even heavier than ever. No Regard for customer service."}
{"text":"I used to love this location but the last two or three times i visited the food was lackluster, service is usually good but they served me a burrito with barely cooked rice at least twice then theu served me a burrito on another occassion that had fully intact cow HEART VALVES. the manager tried to convince me 'thats just fat'... No! It was not!! It was disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Recently opened and they are getting the hang of it and even starting to smile.  The management is clueless.  They keep the restaurant at walk in refrigerator temperatures.  Right now, for example, people are sitting outside in the high winds to avoid the bone chilling and food chilling temperature inside.  It is disappointing to get chipotle style customer service where they rush you through the line and screw up our orders.  It's a mess, but the food is tasty.  Save yourself the headache and go to the far superior blue diamond location"}
{"text":"Tired of going to this location & the meat portions being so small. A tostado salad should have more than 3 bites of pork on it"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!  The cook tried to serve me half cooked chicken by slicing a thin piece off of the breast that was still cooking on the grill. GROSS! I expressed my disgust and promptly walked out without any food."}
{"text":"It was ok, but definitely nothing special. Tried the taco plate and nachos. Not bad for some quick takeout Mexican food, but I'm sure there are better options for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday April 23, 2015 at 5:30 pm and they were out of grilled chicken. How does that happen at dinner time? The food counter was also dirty, and the rice was so salted it was not edible. This is my third time at the location. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Have been here many times, both this location but also the ones on Eastern and Stephanie, and while you can't argue that the food is good you can argue that the service and the way you order is simply pathetic.  Walking in and seeing a line snaked like DMV at 1230 with 35 min wait time on a Tuesday is grotesque, it's not that busy, all that has to be done is an ordering system like all other places where you place your order and pick it up later, go see how efficient that works at any Jimmy Johns, this is it we are not coming back.  So until you can figure that out it's Mexican food at any other outlet."}
{"text":"Parla and Angel took care of my order today. They were friendly, fast, clean and welcoming. Both if them had great smiles too. I normally come here in the evening and the older guy manger is normally there. He seems to run a tight ship and the grumpiness shows. The girls made my visit enjoyable. I hope to see more of them and less of him. Oh man my chicken nachos were mouth watering. Thank you Parla and Angel"}
{"text":"I've tried it twice, and I have to say this place is not for me. If you like cilantro (I don't) you'd probably like it. The burrito was bland, the quesadilla was good, but dripping with grease. The chips were good, but the queso had a bad flavor."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Ever go somewhere that could have been great, but the other clientele really sour the experience for you?   Never having been to Cafe Rio, we didn't know that dinner hour would be quite the zoo it was. Since the place was busy, we decided to get our food to go.   This is what I wish I would have known: (one) it's advisable to read the menu and make your choice while still at home. There is no big-print menu up high so that you can read it from way back in the line. There are two small menus available to peruse as you make your way through the line. The first is in an awkward spot and the second is half a step from the spot where the employees start asking you what you want. I say \"start asking\" because (two) it seems you'll be asked 3-4 times what you want/ordered. You have to remember. (Three) you don't really get the \"choose your own ingredients\" option here like you would at say, Chipotle. The item you order comes with certain stuff on it and the staff will ask you if you want that stuff. But that's it. Much more sit-down restaurant in that regard. (Four) Unless you're tall, you won't be able to see your food being made on the other side of the counter.   (Five) There are some patrons of this location that think it's totally fine to have 7 kids under 6 and an infant through the line accompanied by a single adult (who is trying to order for his giant party, as 3 other adults sit, kidless, at a table). If that was you or someone you know, for the love of god, sit the kids at a freaking table while you order so they aren't running around, blocking the menu and stepping on other people's toes.  Anyway, we both got tacos; mine were mahi mahi and Boyfriend's were steak. Both came with rice & beans. Everything was good and I'd go back to try something different, but if it's as overrun with horror children the second time, I don't feel like I'll be losing anything if I never go back."}
{"text":"Total scam I ordered the kids free quesadilla  and was charged $3.99 - then $2.19 per drink for horchata that was empty and they would not refund our money.  The restaurant was filthy.  No thank you - never again."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is slow. I've been standing in line for 20 minutes and the line isn't even long. As a restaurant manager, I know this isn't what managers want to hear about their establishments. I think part of the reason is that there in nearly zero communicstion, employees are moving slowly, and they seem to not care. Just some feedback for the crew to improve. Best wishes!"}
{"text":"This review is for the brand new location at Paradise valley located South of Cactus on Shay. Facebook offered free meal for the first 200 who signed up. I had the Maria's enchiladas with sweet pork Barbacoa very tasty. Watch out Chipolite they are giving you a run for the money."}
{"text":"Did not like this place. I thought maybe it would be better then chipotle, I was wrong.  I got a steak burrito , they put the meat in my burrito and started rolling it up before I chose my veggies. I stopped them and said \"wait I didn't choose my veggies yet\". They said \"sorrt burritos don't come with veggies\".  I told them it was my first time and I didn't know.   So they put veggies in for me this once but were mad at me and giving me looks because they had to reduce the burrito.  Uh, where's the food customer service?  Not here.  I don't eat rice so they put the meat and started rolling my burrito.  Did they think that I wanted meat in a tortilla and that's it? So ridiculous.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"This is over of my favorite \"fast food\" places.  The sweet pork is amazing.  The burritos are huge as are the salads. You will never leave here hungry.  I also love the selection of lemonades and teas."}
{"text":"The blonde girl with the Marilyn piercing was so incredibly rude to my friends and I. Her attitude was terrible and she was in such a rush to leave at 10:00, when the store doesn't close until 11:00, that she somehow forgot the most important part of her job, guest service :-) we informed another worker of the attitude issue and she apologized on the blonde girl's behalf. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food but don't go there expecting San Diego-caliber Mexican food, but rather, more Tex-Mex or comparable to Chipotle.  Very fresh ingredients, and ample portions.  Service is a little slow but only because they're usually pretty busy.  They put cilantro in almost everything, including their rice so if you're not a fan, you better speak up beforehand."}
{"text":"Let's not kid ourselves-- this isn't the most authentic Mexican food available. However, the food is fresh, fast, and delicious.  I have tried the tacos, burritos, salad, and quesadillas.  For my money, I think the Cafe Rio salad with Chile Roast Beef is the best bet. My wife usually orders the pork burrito with an extra side of tortillas to soak up the flavorful juices that are left.   I am most impressed with how the restaurant handles orders in an efficient manner.  No matter how busy the place is, you can get your food relatively quickly.   I would like more spicy options, but that is just a personal preference. Move over Chipotle, I have found a better option."}
{"text":"One of my friends swore by this place, so I decided to check it out.  I ordered a few steak burritos and steak salads for my friends. I personally ate the steak salad and it was pretty darn good. The salad was put on top of a flour tortilla that was baked with cheese. I chose black beans to go with mine. There was rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, guac, tortilla strips, cilantro, and cheese. For salads, the dressing selections were a creamy tomatillo dressing or a cilantro lime vinaigrette. I opted for the creamy one and it was DELICIOUS. I am really picky when it comes to the quality of my ingredients. For example, if I see wilted, browning lettuce in my salad; I will not eat it. The lettuce here was very fresh and I did not have an issue with the produce. The dressing though made the salad! You MUST get the tomatillo dressing! I was just sad that they charged extra for more to-go containers of the dressing.  The prices here are very reasonable. I believe my steak salad was about $9-$10? I just wish Cafe Rio was located closer to the Strip! It was quite a drive to get here! The customer service here was pretty decent. I felt so bad for the worker who was taking my 5 item order haha! I will most definitely be coming back here when I am in the area. They also have a stamp card :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have looked all over Vegas for good Mexican food and finally we found it here. Food is tasty and fresh.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Yes it is a chain and fast food where you serve yourself, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Fresh tortillas is the only thing I like about this place. They're like wannabe Chipotle but the serving size is less than half and twice the price.  Their burritos are literally 2 tablespoons of rice and two tablespoons of beans with a real small amount of meat. If u add a little more rice =$1.00, add sour cream=$1.00, if u do steak Add'l $1.50, even for the single taco! Geez! So greedy! Went accidentally to eat during lunch hour, busy..... So I thought they're all in a rush so they only give a tiny amount of food... 3 days after I thought I'd give it another chance so I went on a dead hour and really!!! Same amount of serving. Never had a burrito before that didn't fill me up... It's like eating a taco amount! I'm not exaggerating. The only thing that will fill u is their tortilla because its all dough your eating! Just hate that everything is $1.00 extra!  I guess this is not the chipotle or Baja fresh standards, They're suppose to be different in a very expensive way."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and the food is still amazing. My first dish here that I tried was the chicken quesadilla the first time I came, and it was great! The reason I gave 4 stars however, is because the service was a little bit slow, but besides that, this restaurant was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio. The Eastern location has never disappointed me; however, in the past two online orders I've done for this Blue Diamond location, there's always something either missing or incorrect. Normally, I would disregard if something was missing if it wasn't anything major, but today, I ordered a chicken tostada, extra lettuce, black beans and no rice, lime on the side. My container had five bites of lettuce, a handful of cilantro, no lime to be seen, and beans in EVERY SINGLE BITE. Why would I pay for an extra 2oz of delicious tomatillo dressing when there's no lettuce!? The normal 2oz of dressing that it comes with was TOO MUCH for what I had today.   I feel like I am eating sour cream and cilantro with chicken and beans that happens to have bits of lettuce. HORRIBLE. UNFORTUNATE for such a known name to have such terrible results when it comes to constructing food that is in a food line that only requires someone to read down the list of what to put onto a container.  I am extremely disappointed. I cannot believe I'm considering driving down to the Eastern location just to get the correct order and have a decent amount of food in my container."}
{"text":"Great lunchtime Mexican buffet.  Prices are reasonable.  But,irritating music is loud and distracting and the place could use more people to keep tables clean."}
{"text":"Stopped In to get a chicken salad for dinner, after waiting longer than usual I finally make it to the register to pay. Three  employees were standing there laughing and chatting like I wasn't there. The girl who takes the money asked if it was for there of to go? I said to go she didn't wash her hands and puts a lid on my salad as she is trying to fit it on I see her pushing my food with her fingers, after she throws it in a bag she comes to get my money and I said maybe the person who takes the money should not touch the food. I was so grossed out. She said \"oh I'm sorry\" she offer to make a new one but after the wait I said no. Got home looked in bag....no dressing no fork no napkins. Ended up tossing my salad in the trash."}
{"text":"Love the BBQ pork on the tostada. If I'm really hungry I'll get the salad. The salad dressings are tasty. Fast service. Get a frequent dining card."}
{"text":"Another great Cafe Rio location!  We stopped in for dinner during our vacation in August and ate outside on the patio with our dog.  This location was very busy, but the staff handled the rush well.  I enjoyed the pork barbacoa enchiladas with rice and beans...so deliciously good!"}
{"text":"Great food but need to work in the quality of togos"}
{"text":"Delicious. I recommend calling in a phone order if it's during lunch time. It can get pretty backed up. We always order the chips and queso and pork salad. Always delicious."}
{"text":"Sofia went above and beyond to make our night awesome. My son and I have different tastes, this was our 2nd stop. First 1 not good. So to have an employee welcome us and  treat us graciously is 10 Stars. You need more people like her. Thank you Sofia with an F. Much love."}
{"text":"Staff are idiots. Plan to repeat your order about 5 times and then again to the cashier. Food is good but not worth the customer service experience to get the food. One employee asked me what was wrong and when I told her she brushed me off. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They're lucky to get 1 star. Because of the incompetent people that work here, the quality of the food is highly affected. Ordered 3 salads, the amount of meat is inconsistent, beans are watery because it's almost gone & they didn't refill it, lettuce from bucket was also watery when they refill it, didn't bother to shake extra water. So the salads were like soup. Asian guy employee was so irritated that he could just careless. The owner of this place should think of revamping his/her staff. Felipe"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT - we really love it, but the service is HORRIBLE. Last week we stood in line for 25 minutes. The first woman behind the counter was doing all the work, getting the initial order set up. The young girl next to her just stood and played with the lettuce. The first woman was slow, fed up, and complaining about how much her feet hurt and how much longer her shift was, so she created a bottle neck. The next three staff were the female lettuce whisperer and two young guys who must have been new that day. It was half an hour before we sat to eat. By that time, nothing tastes good. BTW, the restaurant was empty, probably because of the half an hour prep time - everyone else had already eaten and left by the time we sat down.Cafe Rio, if you want people to come back, fix the bottle neck - have two people or three start the process and one or two to do the garnishes. It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Got home order was wrong. Paid for stuff I didn't get.  Also ordered a beef salad got half beef half steak. Don't waste your time with this place!"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you like spicy or any mexican-style flavor really at all.  Also, it was so noisy when ordering they got so many things messed up and double-billed us for an entree.  To top it off, my pork tasted like sugar.  Gross.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Well, I've been begging my wife to go eat with me at cafe rio. Well she caved and came with. Well. All the drinks containers were empty at 8:30 pm. I asked the guy at the register and he said we're out or they are plugged. Well, what is it or are you too lazy to fill them? Now we are forced to drink soda. If you can't meet demands, close early. There were no discounts or offers to make it right.  I liked your food but now I will go elsewhere where they cater to the patrons."}
{"text":"I love the salads from here !! Always fresh and their homemade dressings are amazing !!"}
{"text":"They just opened. We've eaten here numerous times since then. The quality and taste have decreased each time to the point where last night was watery, disgusting burritos that tasted like dish water. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is getting worst everyday.  Prepare to dumb down significantly when you order.  What do I mean?  They ask for my order and I said, I would like a grill beef salad.  They told me, no such thing.  They do however have grill steak?  Huh? Isn't that the same thing?  Also be prepare to give your order to the same person over the glass 3 times or more.  They can't seem to remember your order for more than 1 second.  And don't even think of getting a friendly greeting...good food by horrible everything else.  Do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Used to eat at another cafe rio location all the time and loved it. We were really excited to see one opening in the neighborhood but after a bout of food poisoning we can't go near it."}
{"text":"The guy that asked what salsa I wanted was extremely rude. I pointed at the salsa I wanted because I didn't know the name and he said \"don't do that again\" in a harsh tone. I felt embarrassed and confused as to what I did that was wrong. I am particular with which businesses I choose to spend my hard earned money at. I will not go to this location again. There were several people around him that didn't say anything to him. Is this how Café Rio treats their customers?"}
{"text":"On Wednesday January 14 I placed a pretty an order of 4 tostada Salads for the special they have on Wednesdays. It's took 4 people to actually take my order on the phone. They couldn't get the details correct. I showed up for pick up, I had to remind them that it came with a drink. I had to ask them for the chips for the chips and dip we ordered. I grab my order and go. They did not pack any of the dressing for our salads although they asked me a few times if we wanted vinegrett or house. I clearly asked for house dressings. We were all upset as out office is not around the corner. I called them to let them know of the poor esperoence then they put Michael. I started to tell him my experience and he cut me off saying we were busy. Mind you this restaurant is busy during lunch hour every Monday - Friday an efficient manager would staff accordingly. Quite frankly that was not my problem. My issue was poor service aince the phone call was placed. I asked why asle me a few times if you're not gonna put the dressing in my order. He said and I quote \"obvioisly it does and obviously they didn't include it.\" I'm sorry I work in the service industry and that is not how you treat guest. He was so rude and careless. I'm your average person looking for a freebie, I can afford my food. He asked what would you like me to do? Then he suggested 4 free salads I dos take them. I used it up today the service once again was horrible. One of the salads that we asked for no beans had a lot of beans. We asked for the red briscata sauce they have us the regular burrito hot sauce. Just so you know Michael- I was just looking for a sincere apalogy not your careless attitude. I would have loved for you to show your face today and apologize for the crapy service. This cafe rio has lost our entire office business. We will drive the extra miles to get better service."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rios food, but I've been dissapponted just about every time I've been to this location. I keep giving them a shot only based on the fact that they are newly opened and I understand that there are bugs to work out with training employees and such, but now that they've been open a couple months, there's just no excuse. Besides messy food assembly line, and poor customer service, the guacamole I got on my salad was brown and the lettuce wilted. And don't bother calling in an order. It does nothing. They wouldn't acknowledge that I was standing there waiting for my order and when they finally did, it was \"sorry.\" THEN.....I had to go stand in line. Ugg! Skip this location and just drive down to Eastern or Stephanie. Seriously."}
{"text":"I've been to several Cafe Rio's around town and this location is below average. Not a well managed restaurant. I've been to this location about 8 times since I live close by. Very slow all the time especially compared to the location at Bell Road and 75th Ave., trash cans overflowing on many occasions, tables not cleaned off regularly. Staff is always confused. Sometimes they ask me if I want everything on my salad, sometimes they go through every individual item and ask me if I want it and sometimes they just put a couple of ingredients on the salad and call it a day. I almost always have to ask for salad dressing.  The food is has always been very good. Hence, two stars.  Management/Owner, if you're reading this, you need to get in there and spend some time there and get your team organized and trained or you WILL start to see a decline in business."}
{"text":"This may be an unfair review, but my experience here was frustrating. I placed a takeout order otp and was told it wouldn't be ready for 45min. 45min later I showed up, but they had no record of any takeout orders.  If I still wanted my food, I was told it would be at least another 30min before it would be ready.  This was at 14:30, so I guess business is good. Their customer service and organization, however... not so good."}
{"text":"I have had numerous unpleasant experiences at the various Cafe Rio restaurants around town, but this one takes the cake. We ordered our food, paid with a gift card, and the amount came off the card. We go to leave with our food, and the manager (Benjamin) called us back and said we hadn't paid. We attempted to show him proof, and he still said we hadn't paid. At this point he began raising his voice at us and saying we needed to pay for our food, when in actuality he was trying to double charge us. He refused to give us our food and threw it away in front of us, despite us still having nearly $100 on our gift card. This is not the first time we have had a bad experience there, but I guarantee that it is the last. I have never been treated so poorly by anyone at a restaurant despite being completely polite the entire time. We needed up going to Chipotle and they were wonderful with excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Food is always good!!!  The major problem is that no one is managing this place. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and I was the only person in here. They were out of grilled chicken, annoying. The girl working was apologetic, but come on really. This place has so much potential if there was someone paying attention."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is quiet possibly my favorite quick stop on my way home. Because of the great location and healthy option for a quick meal this is easily one of the most popular in the city. Their homemade tortillas and house made dressing are incredible! It is a rare find to see a fast service restaurant making fresh food in front of your eyes. Although the food line gets very messy and sometimes I think to myself, \"is this up to code?\", I still choose to eat here several times a week. After a long day at work and cooking for one isn't ideal - cafe rio is a great choice!!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much a worse version of chipotle.  I went here on taco Tuesday but was not super impressed with what the tacos looked liked so I got a burrito.  The burrito was okay I just thought it was bland.  I got the hot sauce on it and it wasn't very hot.    The staff here were very polite and good with everyone.  They were friendly.  Even though it was crowded they didn't act irritated at all.  The cost here is okay.  It's kind of expensive but not too bad.  $2 taco Tuesday is a good deal but my $9 burrito wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"a worker (who looked like the manager) called another employee anorexic for feeling sick and throwing up in the restroom. terrible person."}
{"text":"The food is good but this place has the WORST customer service.  They throw your food, are so slow, act like you should know what comes in everything,  the tall guy is so rude, and they are ALWAYS out of something.  Zaba's is much better, I just wish it were closer. We will have to start going to the Cafe Rio on Centennial from now on."}
{"text":"We ate at this place a few times during their buy one get one free promotion.  This place is just like Costa Vida down the street.   I am surprised at the lack of enthusiasm from the staff here. I see them slowly move around while tidying up the restaurant and even texting.  It reminded me of teenagers workers from Six Flags.   The food is pretty good and worth a shot. What I really appreciate is that they offer free quesadillas for kids under 6. When you try one of these you can really taste the freshness of the tortillas."}
{"text":"I like the food but every time I visit for some reason the staff is sad and seem like they don't want to take my order or don't like me. They toss my food while preparing my order. I try to order with a smile, I don't understand.  Very upset with the service"}
{"text":"I usually like this place but beware of shrimp tacos. They leave the tail on despite the fact that they fill the taco with goodies. The shrimp was cold and unappetizing as well."}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about this place & finally my boyfriend took me here earlier today. Very warm & friendly environment (which I loved!!). The food is 100% homemade & fresh. The employees were very nice & made it a fun experience.  I got one of their salads - OH MY GOD! So much food for me, but at least I got to bring the rest home!   I can't believe it took me this long to try this place. Boy have I missed out. I will DEFINITELY be going back!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service. It has become my favorite lunch stop through the work week! I'm not sure if the fact that they now recognize me is good or a sign that I'm in there too often."}
{"text":"Pork Barbacoa Tostadas are amazing!  I've tried other things on the menu which are good also but I always come back to my tried and true. I'll be back in a few days for sure."}
{"text":"The food here isn't good. Your better off going to chipotle. The girl working here needs to smile. They are stingy with the toppings. I thought it would be a nice health alternative than fast food, but I was wrong. Their salads are loaded with carbs and it's super expensive. I wouldn't mind paying for it if it was tasty. Although they do have a nice seating area though. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! With its extremely fresh ingredients, the authentic tortillas, the quick service and delicious food! I had the vegetarian enchilada and though no meat it was still just as savory! I had to slow myself down on eating it because it was sooo good! Vanessa is awesome and described the 100's of drinks that can be created with their convenient drink station!"}
{"text":"I give two stars because I didn't have to wait too terribly long for the food and there was no hair in it (however, I did see one of the food handlers touch the inside of the garbage and then go back to handling food). If you want very bland Mexican food this might be the place for you. It had three stars so I thought I'd give it a shot but we'll never be back... Goodbye $20..."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio it is so delicious! Unfortunately this one is always a mess! The servers are careless when scooping food so all the food is mixed in the different compartments. The trash is overflowing every time I've eaten here. I have never seen a worker cleaning off the filthy tables. With all of the complaints about cleanliness you would think that it would've improved by now."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily delicious and fresh food. Uniquely prepared, similar to homemade but very gourmet. Very friendly English speaking servers.  Five star all the way.  Look for the daily specials. They are worth your order!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last week to redeem my $5 off birthday coupon!  This new location is conveniently located to the ASU campus, but it was dead due to the holidays.  The staff was friendly, but definitely needed more training on coupons.  The food was equally delicious as other locations I have visited...absolutely love the sweet pork enchiladas with rice and beans.  We will still frequent the Camelback location as it has a much warmer and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"One day I was wondering what the big hooplah was over Cafe Rio. Personally, at the time, I was Team Chipotle all the way but my curiosity got to me. So I go in and order the salad.  I ordered the salad with salmon and the house dressing. When I got to my table with the mint limeade, I almost couldn't bear to eat my salad because it looked so pretty with the green romaine lettuce (I requested both chopped and shredded lettuce) pico de gallo, scoop of guacamole, crispy tortilla strips, cilantro and that white cheese they put on top. With the tomatillo cilantro house dressing, it was mighty tasty. And I love their fresh tortillas! That's one thing that's a huge difference from Chipotle. Portion sizes are huge too. I'm always way too full if I finish the whole portion they give me.  During their lunch rush, they are all about speed so don't expect a very warm welcome from their food line, which I can understand. They want to get people in and out asap to make their customers happy because, ultimately, that's all they want: their food. So A for effort there. When they are slower however, the staff is more welcoming. Usually the cashier is very nice. One time I called about missing dressing, told them about the the next time I went and they comped my meal.   I love the selection of drinks and syrups they have to personalize to you tastes. The mint limeade is my favorite but they are all good.   Bravo, Cafe Rio on Stephanie, bravo."}
{"text":"Definitely the nicest Cafe Rio I've ever been to. I ordered extra Barbacoa and they sang me a song!"}
{"text":"Tried the mobile order for the first time. I got the single enchilada with rice and beans. The only thing was I couldn't customize the order with the app, I wanted black beans and I wasn't able to select the enchilada sauce (red or green). Its also extra if you request a side of their medium salsa ($1.00). Whenever I've gone in to Cafe Rio to order I can always request what I want and they don't charge for salsa. I'm probably better off going inside next time. I did like the convenience or ordering ahead and paying. All you have to do is show up to their Pickup counter and give them your name."}
{"text":"Slow staff, dirty dinning room. Always make mistakes on to go orders. SLOW SLOW SLOW!"}
{"text":"This is a chain place and I don't think I can say a whole lot more than others on Cafe Rio.  I do know, from a former student's journalism review, that they don't have microwaves and everything is prepared fresh.  That is a nice thing to know when we are bombarded by so many preservatives.   I think their pork was everyone's favorite but now a new pork is in town: the chile verde pork.  Not as spicy as one may think from the posters but that is okay.  They provide so many different hot sauces that you will be able to tailor it to your needs.   The big news of this visit was the App.  The App made it possible to earn points toward free food.  No more punch card!  I earned 20 free points by signing in on Facebook and I earned a free soda right away.  Nice. The App seems like an incentive to keep me coming back.    Their salmon quesadilla is very yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place!the food is delicious and the staff is always friendly. Eating in is a great idea here. I did try to order in advance once and it was a not a good idea. I ordered my food about 5 minutes before arriving and was quoted a 20 minute wait time which was fine. I came in and they only had 2 people in line. They paid and left. I paid for my order and still had to wait around 10 minutes. I would understand if they had a lot of pick up orders but they didn't. So I learned my lesson and always just walk in to place my order."}
{"text":"I love this food but this location is always disgusting. They have dirty tables, dirty drink fountain areas, dirty windows in the line to place orders, and flies. The last time we came here we walked out because there were no clean tables and the location was pretty empty. I would just go somewhere else because it's the same story each time we have gone there in the last year."}
{"text":"We decided to stop into Cafe Rio for lunch after shopping at the Galleria Mall this weekend and noticed on their menu they had chicken tortilla soup. We ordered one which. And with a heaping amount of shredded chicken, tomatoes and the broth. Topped with a scoop of guacamole and a side of parsley, tortilla strips and some limes. You also get a flour or corn tortilla with it. We also ordered a small cheese quesadilla.  For dessert we tried the Tres Leches topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  All in all a delicious lunch and good dessert. 4/5 for the entire meal."}
{"text":"I brought my BF who is from NYC here and he was very unsure about it. In fact the first time he wouldn't even eat here he went To chipotle. But when we got home and saw my burrito and tired it. He was then mad he didn't order one himself. Now He craves it and eats here regularly! We even bought a bunch if burritos froze them and took it to NYC for his family to try.    I LOVE Cafe Rio. It started in Utah (my homeland) and the lines in Utah go out the door and is always a 30+min wait. So when I came here I was shocked to see it wasn't that busy. I was a little disappointed on the speed of the workers. I am use to having it be like the \"Soup Nazi\" in Seinfeld, know your order and move along. But this location is a slower pace.   Cafe Rio is known for its enchilada style burritos and salads. Anyone that i talked to who didn't like it always got something else off the menu (idk what else is even on it) most popular is the steak or grilled chicken. They make all their ingredients fresh everyday. So from location to location their 'special house dressing' can be slightly different.   They are a little more expensive then other places but deff worth it!!"}
{"text":"Food is the only good thing there. And even that's questionable. Check the chicken and make sure it's not pink. Service is a big grump fest. They are so rude and they act like you are bothering them. I guess when they're so busy, who needs to be nice. Be ready to wait at least 30 minutes in line."}
{"text":"I remembered to review this because I just read my dad's. Yes, my tostada was really good. I am a sucker for a good tostada and I don't think I've had one since August (or the last time I went to Rancho Del Zocalo in Disneyland, which is still in the summer). I didn't get to try my dad's burrito, but I don't really care for beans so I guess it's all good. Cafe Rio is all over Utah (which is pretty full of Mormons and Polygamists [they ARE NOT the same thing, people! Trust me; I have but one mom]). Since a lot of people have moved to Vegas back when the economy didn't suck, some rich dude was like, \"Hey, I could go for some Cafe Rio right now but I don't want to drive to Saint George particularly\". The food is really good and the location is really nice (brand new), but if you don't want to hear the employees shout \"EXTRA CHEESE!!!!\" every five minutes or listen to Elvis Presley, I'd get it to go. Dad, do you think that if we did that, then Peter wouldn't have been so whiny (he wanted In-N-Out)?"}
{"text":"YUM. I didn't come here for \"authentic\" Mexican that I've read in other negative reviews, I just wanted some good food and am a fan of the \"chipotle style\" where you can pick and choose what you want. For me, I can eat pretty much anything stuffed inside a homemade flour tortilla. The fact that they make them fresh is amazing. I came here for the first time this past weekend and had the chicken tacos and ordered a steak burrito for my boyfriend to go. It was really tasty stuff. I will for sure be back for that food!   The only negative I can say is that the line workers literally had frowns on their faces. They looked miserable working. For me, I've worked in places like this when I was younger. Attitude is everything! If you make a customer feel like a burden then you're highly impacting the way people perceive the restaurant. Maybe some people don't care about that, but I do. Thankfully the food saved it for me!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Rio, however, this location is just terrible!! This is the only location close to my house, and so I'm forced to come here, but every time I do I'm disappointed! They literally NEVER have salmon ready! I'm constantly forced to wait 15 min for them to make it. Plus they don't even give a discount or anything for waiting!! This must just be normal for them, as they rarely apologize and seem totally unphased as you sit just waiting while tons of other customers get their food. As the only non-meat protein source, this seems totally ridiculous to be out of all the time. It's a simple fix, don't wait till your actually out of salmon to start cooking more! I hope the management actually reads these comments because I'm not the only upset customer. From now on, I'll drive the extra distance to a different location."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials including a drink for under $8. The food and service is consistently good all the time."}
{"text":"I've always wandered into this location right as the lunch rush picks up. However, I never had a problem finding a table. Sure, the line can get pretty long, but you are watching your tortilla and basically your whole meal, be assembled right in front of you. Their employees have been fast and friendly. They should offer a class during non business hours to learn how to make tortillas. Their chicken is juicy (I always order a chicken quesadilla), their beans and rice fresh and flavorful. Thumbs up to their Horchata too, my all time favorite.  Tip: To save time, you can order and pay ahead, as they have a separate to go/call in line available.   Their kids free cheese quesadilla is the perfect size for littler guys. Ole!"}
{"text":"I have a 1 hour commute to/from work and decided to place an online order or a specific pick-up time (dinner), but it turns out I will have to order in person on this date because the website does NOT allow you to (1) order it naked-style (without the tortilla), (2) select staple toppings such as cilantro, lime, or onions, and (3) add notes/instructions regarding the options not offered.  I hope my inconvenience is a helpful suggestion and please note that my rating is based solely on the website and online ordering.  The food itself is great EVERY time!  Thank you."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio they have great quality food! But they do lack and have been lacking in customer service for awhile. It has seem as if they pick and choose what person they prefer to be nice to! They're also  very stingy on the amount of meat they give out and it can seem like the person before you has gotten more. I do give them credit as they have gotten better over time but they do have a couple things they need to fix."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Requested no cilantro but received cilantro on my salad. Also found a red straight hair in my salad, ... won't be coming back to this location!!"}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying I LOVE Cafe Rio.  Well, their food....not their service.  I have placed several orders to go via their app and the experience has been fair, at best.  However, when I placed a to-go order earlier this week, the experience was awful.  I placed my order at 11:30am.  App advised the order would be ready at 12:15pm.  I arrived at 12:02pm.  Was asked by 4 different employees, over a span of 8 minutes, if we had been helped yet and was told to wait and someone would help us.  Nearly 10 minutes after the order pick up time, the cashier took the payment and scanned my app for rewards. 15 minutes after order pick up time, an employee held up a white slip of paper and yelled to me \"I make your salad now.\"  The order was finally ready at 12:49pm, over 30 minutes AFTER the pick up time and over 45 minutes AFTER we arrived!  There were customers that entered the restaurant when we did, waited in line, ordered their food, ate and LEFT and we were STILL waiting for our pre-ordered food.  I love their food, but the service at this location is horrible.  Even after the long wait, no one apologized for the delay or the wait or the grossly missed pick up time.  In the past, an apology was given along with a cup to enjoy a beverage while I waited.  Oh yeah, and all 3 salads I ordered were made wrong and missing ingredients.  Even if it's out of your way, GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION.  This one is sure to disappoint."}
{"text":"Favorite place to cater from for work meetings. First time I tried it \"live. Came in for lunch of Tues. Taco Tuesday special going on, 1.95 per. Great deal! Place was clean, well staffed. They were friendly and attentive. Cashier went out of her way to make sure got all the discounts. Will definitely make it a taco Tuesday regular."}
{"text":"Its a nice clean restaurant.  Not authentic Mexican food though. They make their burritos weird and when untold them how I wanted it I was told no I dont want it that way. It made me not even want to get a burrito. I was told that Pico de Gallo is nasty in a burrito and I didn't want it like that. I had to let them know that I am a paying customer and I will have it the way I want it. Its hard to hear them when making an order also. The meat spent have authentic Mexican spices either. This is my last time here."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday, this location had a sign out for \"$1.95 tacos all day\". So, I went in and I ordered 3 tacos.. got to the register and it was $13!? Asked the cashier about the sign, they said it's only for Tuesday, but the manager keeps the sign out there all the time and doesn't know why...? It's the classic \"bait and switch\". Don't be fooled!   The cashier didn't do anything about the price and acted as if this happens often. Needless to say I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio and their food is amazing but today when I went in to get food before my work shift the workers were moving sooooo slow, the line was decently long maybe like 7-8 people in front of me. But it shouldn't have taken me 25-30 minutes just to get through the line & pay. It was by far my worst experience in a cafe rio. On top of the slow service they also got my boyfriends order wrong... which is hard to do since they literally make the food right in front of you as you order it."}
{"text":"Nothing different in food same as usual. Did a phone order get there 2 min past time expected and food wasn't ready.....now this is 6pm on Sunday less than 10 patrons and only 3 people in line. Woman came to register and apologized hand me a drink then proceeded to make my order. When I asked for the other dressing she gave me what I wanted and normally they charge extra for she gave it but warned me next time it'll be extra. I asked for grilled chicken got shredded but was charged for grilled. Hope they can fix this. Need to pay attention to order. I'm gonna try again with them hopes they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"So good. So fresh! You know this from the moment you walk in to the strip mall location and the air filles with the smell of flour tortillas.   The sweet BBQ pork is a must try, especially on a salad IF you're a big cilantro fan like myself. The cafe is similar to a Chipotle but with fresher ingredients and hot salso.   In addition, they have a large selection of beverages to choose from - Mexican Coca-Cola and fountain drinks that are unique in flavor. I wish I saw them before the Coca-Cola. After I left, I wanted to try all their refreshing fountain soda that seemed unique to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally took the time to take my butt over to this spot. My brother has been telling me that this place was bomb dot com for weeks!! He also kept comparing it to the neighboring Chipotle and how humongous their servings were!!  Everything previously stated were all true, but I still find myself under Chipotle's customer satisfaction list.  Yes, Cafe Rio is similar to Chipotle because of the whole burrito, tacos, and salad assembly line (where you choose meat, beans, rice, veggies, and dressing), but the tastes make it totally different and incomparable.  I had the Fire Grilled Chicken salad and it was pretty good.  The portions are definitely huge and can be taken to-go as your second meal of the day!! What turned me off was the rice though!! There was just something weird about the taste and texture (I can't seem to find the words for it). The lime rice at Chipotle is definitely undefeated!!! I did like the avocado ranch dressing though! That added another star to my rating! Haha, but overall it was an OK place. You'll definitely need to hit it up on an empty stomach so good luck & eat well! =D"}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Rio in SLC many times and always loved it, so I was super excited when one opened up by my house. I waited in a decently long, slow moving line, and when I got up to order it was clear why. Their set up isn't the problem, it lies with the employees not having clear understanding of what each of them is supposed to do so they are all tripping over each other. I told no less than 4 people that I wanted to order kids quesadillas, and I still didn't have them by the time I got to the cashier, who had to go back to the line cook to have him cook them. I wish I could say the food made up for the service, but it was no Bueno. The sauce and beans were super salty, I couldn't get through half of my burrito. I know they've only been open about 2 months, so I'll give them a few months to smooth things out and give 'em another try before writing them off completely."}
{"text":"Man this place is going downhill and management has got to know. We placed an order to go and they forgot a salad so we turned around, there were multiple other people there who were having issues with their orders, we got home and there was no dressing for the salads which is just no smart. Not sure what is going on here but they are losing business fast."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food ever. I would compare it to a quality of dogfood. I wish I could get my money back but I am too timid to create a scene in public. Will never go here again. This is not mexican food by any means....."}
{"text":"I understand  working out the kinks in a new restaurant but come on! I ordered a chicken enchilada, pinto beans and rice . The food was barely warm. I took it back so that they could run it thru their little oven and it was still barely warm. The dining area was on the messy side and it wasn't even busy. And managers, PLEASE, if an employee has a bad, phlegmy cough, don't assign them as a cashier!"}
{"text":"No matter what day/time I come to this place it's always busy! Now a days I only come on Fridays because of their salmon special.  I ordered a salmon salad which they build with a tortilla base (like what they use as a burrito), rice, fire grilled salmon, greens as the salad, tortilla chips for added crisp, guac, no pico, cilantro, and cheese. You can also add other sides like salsa, beans and sour cream. The best thing about this place is their house dressing. It has a ranch base with some cilantro in it. So delicious! Ordering an extra side of it is about $0.98. I heard them offer another dressing but I'm not sure what it is.   One star taken off for never including utensils in my bag every single time I get it to go. No napkins either. That bothers me because I see that they're near their counter and there's always two or three people around the counter bagging for quicker checkout."}
{"text":"Not only was the \"Manager\" the most rude out of all of the employees she was yelling at other employees in front of customers which is very unprofessional. I go to Cafe Rios all around the valley almost every day. When I came to this cafe rio i ordered my regular which is a side of rice and a side of chicken. At EVERY cafe rio i've ever been to i've been charged $3-$5. SHE TRIED TO CHARGE ME $12. When I tried to ask why it was that much and how never once have i ever been charged this she said word for word \"im the manager and this is how its being rang up\" after that, I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CAFE RIO."}
{"text":"Five stars for catering!!!!    I had a last minute change to an order and they made it happen!  They also have everything ready to go when you arrive with everything you need to keep the food warm and serve it to your guests.   This is an excellent catering option if that is what you are looking for!"}
{"text":"Came into this place before the rush with my friend and they had no steak ready I had to wait 5 mins my Order was wrong I ordered a steak burrito not chicken the manager had this place poorly ran I made them refund my food will not come back here"}
{"text":"This place went from 4 star to 1 star and don't even deserve it! I used to love it here, but the switched staff at night now seem to be very lazy and careless about the job! Avoid this place at night, save your money and appetite and eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch which turned out to be a bad decision. The burrito i ordered was poorly made and rushed. In addition, cafe rio was out of rice.i dont understand how during businesses busiest times, they could run out of a key ingredient. This displays poor management."}
{"text":"Literally the only reason we ever return here is for the food. The customer service is dreadful. It always seems as if requesting custom orders (which is the entire idea of the menu) is a burden to the workers to have to deal with.   You would think with how busy they get, they would keep food ready as well, however, tonight was not the case. I was first told the steak was going to be 20 minutes until it would be  ready. Only two mins, later down the line, I was told the the queso would be about a 30 minute wait. I mean come on, get it together on the service side."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas this is my first stop from the airport! The staff is friendly and the sweet pork salad is a must! The cilantro ranch is unreal!! Please come to Texas!!"}
{"text":"Usually have great service here but sadly today killed that, this doesn't apply to everyone one there but mostly to those behind the line. One of the girls seemed very annoyed with the order and was rushing. I know it's busy but that isn't an excuse to be rude and give poor customer service.  If it weren't for the good food I probably wouldn't visit this location again."}
{"text":"The food is great -especially the tortillas cooked right in front of you.  The customer service is a bit lacking. Sometimes they don't listen to your order/or prepare it as requested.  Biggest issue today- Yelp indicates that they close at 10pm (Sunday).  I tell the cashier that maybe they should contact Yelp to have that updated as I am watching them turn away multiple customers as it just past 9pm. Then when I leave I notice that the sign on their front window indicates 10pm as the closing time too. Simple things...smh   Oh and I swear they turned on the AC or cut the heat- to encourage customers to eat and leave promptly. (It was 48degrees outside)"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, great friendly service and free quesadilla for the kids... clutch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying THANK YOU for opening one on the west side finally! I have been to the location in tempe and I live in the west valley, so I am beyond excited they opened one here!   I read the other reviews and thankfully my experience was nothing like theirs. The line is not confusing at all... If you have ever been to chipotle then you should know exactly what you're doing in cafe rio. You go to the far end and order just like you would at chipotle.   I got (and it is BY FAR my favorite thing to order here) the sweet pork salad. TRUST me you absolutely want to order the sweet pork. It is the perfect amount of sweet and just a TINY bit of spice. Even if you don't order a salad, get the sweet pork. Moving on... I got rice, pinto beans, lettuce, salsa, cilantro, crispy strips, guac (which isn't extra ha) and a lime wedge on the side. The tomatillo dressing is my favorite. The whole salad is on top of a giant piece of tortilla. It's mouth watering!  All 3 women who helped with my order were very friendly! The cashier gave me a punch card and explained how it worked. It was also decently busy for lunch, and as they grow, they will get busier.   Definitely worth coming here!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, although the customer service has always been a little sub par.   Lately, though, it's taken a real nose dive. Two out of the three times I've visited in the last two weeks, they've been out of sweet pork or something else that is popular.   I'd like to keep going, as it's very close to my office and good lunch places are in rare supply around, but I think I'll probably abstain for awhile. Hopefully they'll get back on track, as the tortillas are awesome and the sweet pork is ridiculously good."}
{"text":"No!  Service was fairly rude, to begin with. Then the food was just bad. I ordered the sweet pork barbacoa and, yes, it is sweet. VERY, VERY SWEET. It tasted like meat candy. Then, on the side I got a helping of hard rice. It was probably 5-10 from being fully cooked.  No desire to come back here. Why do people love this place?"}
{"text":"If you're not willing to wait in line for at least 20-30 minutes, this Cafe Rio location is not for you. Whenever I come here to get some dinner to-go, it's always expected that I will be waiting for a long time before I can even place my order. The way the line wraps around reminds me of the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm too afraid to order online and pick up because of previous reviews I've read and orders not being correct/items missing. Good looking out, guys!  The only thing I've ever ordered from Cafe Rio is the salad. Cilantro lime rice and black beans on top of a fresh handmade flour tortilla with melted cheese, seasoned shredded chicken breast, lettuce, Cotija cheese, guac, tortilla strips, and dressing. I'm not much of a dressing person, but the house made Cilantro Lime vinaigrette is freaking delicious! It's so flavorful and has the right amount of cilantro in it, just to let you know that it's there. The Creamy Tomatillo dressing is great too. I usually ask for half and half and it's not a problem to get both. The salad is so filling!  During my last visit, the one thing that turned me off was a female employee emptying the old bin of lettuce and putting it on top of the fresh lettuce that she had just replaced it with. It wasn't even the fact that she was emptying it out, it was the fact that the old lettuce was practically submerged in water and dripping everywhere when taken out of the bin. It wasn't too big of a deal, just something I observed.  As far as customer service goes, the employees are nice. It's just that when they get busy during peak hours, it seems to be a bit hectic on the line and everyone is everywhere at once... If that makes sense.  P.S. Yes, the tortillas are as amazing as everyone says!"}
{"text":"The way this joint makes their food is just superb! Everything is fresh and you can see them either cutting fresh vegetables in the back or cooking and  simmering  the meats which will directly go into your food! They have someone cooking fresh homemade made tortillas in the food line and you get to see the process of how your dish is made! I love this restaurant, honest food here!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a Chipotle wanna-be. The food is decent, the service is less than stellar. The staff needs to read their own menu, as they seem to be confused as to what goes into the food.  We ordered a vegetarian enchilada and a chili roast beef burrito between us. The enchilada was missing the guacamole as the girl doing the assembly wasn't paying any attention to what the customers wanted. The burrito was good, the beef is tasty and nice and tender. I was surprised though that the burrito is nothing but meat, beans, rice, and cheese.  Overall I'm not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"I should have taken the reviews into account.  I figured that Cafe Rios menu is pretty consistent across locations.  The taste, the serving size, the service.  I could not have been more wrong.  I've been to several locations in several states and this just was not consistent.  The sweet pork had no flavor and was definitely not like the sweet pork that I expect.  Ended up throwing my meal in the trash before going to another restaurant.  Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday with my brother and sister in law who recommended this place. Ordered the chicken nachos and thought it would be good but I knew something was wrong when i got to the checkout and their register froze. Needless to say, it took them some time to correct it and my food grew cold even after i told them this would happen. Not even an apology or acknowledgement of my issue. Well, it came to fruition and when i finally sat down, my food was cold, the chicken was dry and just not very enjoyable and my brother had it worse as he was behind me in line. Would not recommend to anyone and the worst part was that the cashier said this was a common occurrence."}
{"text":"Cafe rio was good when I moved here 4 years ago. I went last week and they DO NOT FOCAS. He asks me what type of beans I say black he puts refried. My dad orders they ask him what kind of sauce he says red they put green. We kindly ask for chips and guacamole and they give us chips and queso. The food would be 10x better if they focused!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING....LY awful!  Every time I go to this location is like a trip to idiot island.  The employees act as if the customers are annoying little gnats interrupting their dull conversations.  I have yet to receive an order that is correct, but like a moth to the old flame I go back because the food itself is still pretty darn good.  Until today.  I phoned in a takeout order, which usually results in a look of awe like you just landed in your spaceship.   Cold and runny food, no ice, and no lemonade, I think I've finally learned my lesson.  However, tomorrow is coconut shrimp taco Tuesday so no guarantees....."}
{"text":"I love this place for fast fresh food and great service. They make their tortillas fresh all day use fresh ingredients and overall the taste of the food is fantastic.  If you come on Tuesday they run a taco special for $1.95. My weakness is their twist on jaimaica drink. I think it's called southwest limeade? Not sure but it's the red one made with fresh mint and limes, Yummy!  I'd like to commend one of the employees that took care of my order. His name is Benjamin and he truly did a phenomenal job taking my order, offered me some free guacamole because it was end of shift and made sure he went to the back to get the drink I wanted. Thank you so much Ben for doing something special for me I really appreciated it. If I was one of the owner, I would feel very confident about the store being left in Bens hands."}
{"text":"By far the worst Cafe Rio location in Las Vegas!!  Not only is the staff rude and under trained.. but the managers are horrible  (THAT EXPLAINS ALLOT)..  When we first heard that a Cafe Rio would be open near our home.. we were super excited.  Well.. that was short lived :-(  This review is not based on just one visit, because we all know that once in a while mistakes happen, but our horrible experience has been repeated 8 times!!  We were even served RAW Chicken one time....   We have emailed the corporate office several times in the past two months and have never heard back.  We have now decided to make the drive past this location to the corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs to get our Cafe Rio fix from now on."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrendous! The staff is always arguing with each other acting as if the glass partition is some how an invisible screen or something!  It never seems like there is someone in charge and when it gets busy they seem to fall apart very quickly.  I went in tonight and the tortilla machine broke (not their fault) but they had no backup tortillas and couldn't supply me with a burrito.  Luckily I was able to get my fiance her tacos but I should of at least got some kind of discount or a free burrito for next time.   Not even an apology for the mishap.   Do not go here."}
{"text":"Although I find the food amazing, I will never be going back the Happy Valley Phoenix location.  They clearly do not drug test their employees.  First every time I go in there I see a male employee clearly high as can be.  Acting erratic and his pupils all enlarged.  So easy to see it in his face.  Also the lady ringing up was the same exact scenario.  Buzzing around all crazy eyes dilated big sore on her mouth.  Could barely keep up with what she was saying.  It's pretty obvious when you are familiar with drugs what someone on an upper or meth looks like.  Just makes me think of hepatitis, and unsanitary food when being prepared by these people.  Employees should be pop up drug tested that is for sure."}
{"text":"Lunch rush was crazy . Sloppy line servers . Dirty tables . Food not as fresh as I remembered in my one other time here. My kids have never ordered from here and were rushed thru their selection process of ingredients. Not a comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, 5 stars. Never had a bad tasting meal.   Their service leaves you wanting to eat else where, 2 stars. Not sure how they always have 8+ people working but no one is working to get the customers food out hot. From the time the food came out of the oven it was over 5 minutes until we had paid and we still had to get drinks and silverware before we could eat. And on top of everything, the restaurant was freezing cold which only adds to the food getting colder faster.   Whenever I go, it's always with the expectation of cold food. Thank goodness the quality of food is good and makes up for it ALWAYS being cold."}
{"text":"Try the sweet pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style with mild green sauce it's FANTASTIC!!!"}
{"text":"I tried again and confirmed last review. They have cut back tremendously on what they give and quality is disappointing. Ordered nachos and it was pretty much a bowl of chips. Please just raise prices and give better food again"}
{"text":"This place is soooo dirty every single time we come here but it is across the street so who can complain. Idk I was gonna grab the lady to wipe the table but the rag she was using looked dirtier than the table she was about to clean. Also she didn't have any cleaner with that rag so shit I didn't want salmonella or anything else on this table. Anyways I ended up wiping out table with some napkins but to tell u the truth there is a thick sticky layer of guck on the table top so the napkin really didn't do any good.  They do have some great looking and good looking food and on Wednesdays they have a tostada special for 7$ including a drink. They also have a drink bar with horchata and lime aid with all the drink mix ins. Will come back cause my friends like this place but not because of the cleanliness."}
{"text":"At a dental office next door to this place, was super hungry so i went a cross while wating for my GF, and was surprised with the quality of food here and the taste, i would call this place an Upgraded version of Chipotle, I loved it. Same concept, fresher and more options than chipotle including fish... great Salads with amazing dressings, they give you a lot of food and are not stingy with the portions.  I just found out that there is one in Tustin right by my house as well. I am sure they are going to be popping up everywhere pretty soon, so if i were you i would try this place out, amazing taste, friendly staff, super fresh...  My new go to place over chipotle for sure!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio gets 5 stars from me!  I ordered the 'award winning' barbacoa salad (***be sure to order this with the Tomatillo dressing!) Let me start of by saying I'm not normally a fan of barbacoa but everyone kept telling me how great theirs was and I've got to say it was the best, most filling, flavorful salad I've had in a LONG time. They also create the salad on top of a fresh, warm, flour tortilla so that when you're finished eating the leafy portion of the salad so have a burrito to complete your meal. Aside from the delicious meal the prices were very reasonable, the portions were perfect, and the staff was comedic, friendly, and delightful to be around. I will definately be visiting Cafe Rio again."}
{"text":"Fast!  It's not fast at all!!!ive been waiting for this salmon for over 30 mins now.  It doesn't take that long to cook some salmon.  Over done!  And I'm still waiting!  How annoying!   I've been watching that salmon sit on that grill for over 20 mins and she finally flips them over.  Only we 20 mins so far and I'm still waiting.  Nothing more annoying than waiting and on top of that for some over done fish!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great staff! Stefano is the best employee. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here because I can order a delicious vegan salad bowl with cilantro dressing and whole wheat tortillas! And it's a great place to come with friends after classes at unlv.   The only reason I am giving this place three stars is that their service is poor. Always rushing you even when there's no line, and have no manners. And I am not judging off of one employee, they are like that every-time, but only at this location.  But it's in such a convenient location so I keep coming back. So if u know what u want in ur burrito, salad,.. Etc, don't let them rush you and get what u deserve! ;p"}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle, you have a whole assembly line of workers preparing your meal.  I heard this place is always crowded, always a line. They have daily specials and when I went on a Thursday, tamales were their special of the day. It comes with rice and beans along with 2 pork tamales. You can customize anything to your own personal liking. The tamales were just good. It was enough to get me full. Nothing outstanding. The daily specials come with a drink as well.  Did I like it? Yeah. Solid 4 stars for me. There's three kinds of salsa. The medium have a sweet, tangy taste to it. So I opted for the mild. The flavoring was bland. Next time...I'll definitely try the hot.  Maybe this is a Vegas thing. But personally, I would clump this together with Baja Fresh type-a food."}
{"text":"Food is amazing , the service is not great but we are hoping for improvements as it is a new location."}
{"text":"In general Cafe Rio is a real tasty meal. Hate to give a store 1 star but they definitely EARNED it today based on the (total lack of) service.  Today I ordered a steak taco and a shredded chicken taco.  Menu says $8.49, upcharge for steak of $1.50 or $.75 for a single item. That makes my meal $9.24 (1 regular taco and 1 premium).  I was charged $9.99.  I asked the cashier and she said it's just how it rings up. I said again that this isn't what the menu says.  She came out and read the menu and then actually said \"what do you want me to do?  Refund it?  This is just ridiculous!\"  Really?!?  So told her that was ok - refund the whole thing because I'm leaving. I asked for the managers name (Carol?) and was told she was right over at a table talking to 4 other employees. While I'm walking over to talk to the manager, this cashier starts talking about me to other employees.  I introduced myself to the manager and shared my story. Her eyes got big and she asked me to identify the cashier. It was easy to identify her - she was still talking to peers and waving my receipt around in the air. The manager apologized and told the staff she needed to go talk to (I believe she said Amanda?).  Then I left.    And for those of you who want to give my grief about $.75 I get it. It's not going to break me, but it needs to be right. For $10 I can have lunch at a full service restaurant on a real plate with real service. This is fast food.  I'll pay a little for convenience - but no upcharge for the attitude please.   Tom's bottom line:  stay the hell away from this store. There are other Cafe Rio stores in the area where you can get the same good food without the nastiness.   @caferio #badservice"}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that I can probably chalk my initial experience with his location up to having just opened. I've visited several times since with no problems whatsoever. They can still be very busy at times, and consequently slow, but that's the case at all locations. Good food is worth a little effort."}
{"text":"Been a fan of Cafe Rio for awhile now. It's always been a fun place to eat, and I love hot sauce (they have the best variety among their similar competition.)   The new location off Durango is beautiful. Great setup and the colorful ambiance you would expect from the Rio brand.  Had a simple grilled chicken taco meal this time with beans and rice. The selection of toppings is a nice touch as usual but the meat itself was simply okay. The cilantro rice was undercooked at this location. Had a black bean pinto mix and that was on point.  Not a bad visit by any means, Cafe Rio is still one of my preferred Mex Food destinations."}
{"text":"Sunday dinner, 5pm. No crowd, checked menu board, proceeded to order. Because of the loud music it was hard to hear the counter person, they had to repeat themselves so we could order. I had the salad with the chile roast beef, tasty, but they were out of salsa and guacamole.  I was not sure my salad was supposed to have the guacamole until I came to Yelp to post and checked the menu. They should have told me, offered to bring it out when ready, or offer a discount,  'cause they charge for extra guacamole.  I guess if you don't know what isn't there you don't miss it, but when you find out you feel cheated."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location, its located off of Arville on Blue Diamond, not far from the I15 Blue Diamond exit. It is inside a shopping center tucked into a corner, fairly easy to find. You walk right in and there is colorful wallpaper everywhere, and after you wind through people eating you find the line queue.   It was semi-busy, it took about 5 minutes to get someone to take my order which I thought was fairly fast considering how many people were online. Very fast assembly line system. I ordered the salad, pinto beans, with shredded chicken, I was through in about 2 minutes and paying for my meal.  My only negative is that while i was waiting for my meal to be made I asked the server a question and she looked like me like I had a thousand heads, she turned to her colleagues and they had the same reaction, finally someone came by and answered my question. I then realized they didn't speak english. All I asked was which was the spiciest sauce they had and no one can tell until someone save the day.  Great so I got my food and was told the Cholula and Tapatio were by the drink fountain. Awesome!!! What a wide array of hot sauce all at your disposal!! I filled my cup of water and grabbed me a bottle of Tapatio. I doused my salad with the hot sauce like putting out a fire with water hoping for the opposite effect. And I got exactly what I had hoped for.   Once you dig through the top of the salad you hit pay dirt, the shredded chicken and it tasted fresh and very savory, had a good flavor. The whole salad sits on a large soft tortilla which you find yourself picking apart at the end, at least I did. Next time I come back I will have to try one of their burritos as they looked really good. Will the burrito match up to Chipotle's or be better? Someone let me know!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is cause of the employees. The food here is incredible I can't get enough of it but the ladies they have working the line are terrible. They don't look at you they just start throwing stuff on your plate. They look at me like I'm the devil when I want to add something like sour cream or a side of quest to my order and they'll also put stuff on there I don't want them give me a death glare when I say I don't want that and they have to take it off or remake it. I'm not that picky I'm a simple guy but if I'm paying for my food I want it how I want it. Food is great but the service is killing it for me. There's a place close to here in Dana Park off val vista and baseline called Costa Vida same exact set up and food and their sweet pork is just as good as Cafe Rio. I would recommend trying it that's where I've been going instead. Only difference between the two is the employees at costa vida don't make you feel like an A-Hole for ordering the food the way you want it."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio, but this location can be a bit slower than some of the others. I used to live near the one on Stephanie, and they always kept the line moving super quick there."}
{"text":"I'm not one to bash a business, however I do have some honest concerns with my experience at this location....   We first arrived and asked for a steak quesadilla.. the girl informed us that they were out of steak and it would be ready in about a minute, we told her that was fine.. she than continued to put what was left on the steak she just told us she ran out of onto our \"steak quesadilla\"   We we went onto the guy who does the salsa/ rice and beans and the guy standing behind us was one of his coworkers so hey started small talk among us waiting to tell him which salsa we wanted.... the guy (the one working)  started telling his coworker in line that he \"rolled a blunt for the first time high\" after hearing this I was a little discourage and he made eye contact with me and immediately changed the conversation. He gave us out rice and beans and pico and that was that.   We got our food and sat down and our quesadilla MAYB had 3 pieces of steak on it.. when we went back to show them they tried to charge us for an extra side of meat.... on top of that the rice was hard and very undercooked. Very disappointing for someone like myself who LOVES cafe rio :/"}
{"text":"Food is always good but the service is awful. Everyone has an attitude- trust me I've been on the other side and I understand when people order a handful of things at the same time. But when the person is apologetic (which I shouldn't have to be but I get it) and the liner worker still has attitude is where I draw the line. The lady even slid the salads across the counter and they all knocked into one another, literally two inches of almost falling off the counter. Not a single person smiles and not a soul greets you when you get in line. If it wasn't for how consist the food is I would probably never go to this location. Turns down the place-"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican fast food! It's affordable and fast. My boyfriend finally took me here after raving about it and I must say thank goodness! We got the sweet shredded pork burrito. Ask for \"enchilada style.\" So much better because the sauce is amazing. It must be homemade bc I can't find it anywhere in Walmart. We also got some beef and chicken tacos but nothing special. Their flour tortilla is so soft and made fresh. I took pictures for ya'll to see!   The staff is friendly and generous with the \"extras\" such as lettuce, lemons, and jalapeños! Just ask.   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Hawaii in Feb and my friend brought me here.  I'm back on island now & can't express how much I miss this place!! The steak salad gave me a glimpse of heaven. Lol"}
{"text":"One of the worst things about Yelp is that there are no options for Zero stars for restaurant's that truly deserve it. That statement is only for this location and not for the Cafe Rio chain as the others I have been to have all been wonderful, but the management at this location is truly horrendous. If you want a better experience go to the one next to Sportsman's Warehouse and you will see what this chain really stands for. The store on Decatur is a easy fix, just bring in a manager that actually knows how to run a restaurant and isn't insulting to customers. The manager is truly a piece of work and really need to be retrained. I have been in sales and traveled the western US for the past 40 years and I have never come into contact with worst customer service, this guy really takes the cake."}
{"text":"First time to order here. Had to provide lunch for a dr's office. Asked the manager if I could pick up around 10:15am for just this time and couldn't do it. I'm not sure what the food taste like, but I will not be coming back here nor will I try this place. Customer service and courtesy are important to me."}
{"text":"We regularly come to this location and today the staff was killing it! Especially Brianna, she got through the line pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Disgusting store.  The entire place is filthy and smells like a unwashed and sweaty foot. Want to vomit."}
{"text":"I love this location - the service is excellent.  The quality is great.  I love the pulled chicken quesadilla with extra quacamole.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I had the shredded chicken quesedilla with pico, extra guacamole and sour cream.  To die for!  The freshly handmade tortilla and shredded chicken make it.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location and not having SHREDDED CHICKEN! \"We ran out.\" How on earth do you run out of shredded chicken!? Seriously- I then asked, so you miss planned and ran out, \"yes we did.\" Gotta love honesty. However, not good business at all. We left."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is the WORST I've ever been to. The service is AWFUL and the wait staff are rude.  They spilled black beans all over the container and still put it with my order,dripping with spilt sauce all over. They scrimp on portions of meat and are regularly out of toppings, especially Guacamole! Go the extra mile to another location, Gilbert Rd or SanTan. You'll be not as disappointed"}
{"text":"They charge for every little thing. Will not go back to this location. Workers needs some attitude adjustments"}
{"text":"I feel claustrophobic here... Chairs too close together. Too loud. Good Food."}
{"text":"We had a good experience at the Durango location so we figured we SHOULD like this location too. WRONG! They are so unorganized. It seems like the workers are not sure how to fix the orders. This is a franchise place. Don't they all follow the same recipe/ procedure? Anyway, not coming back to this one. Will have to try and find another Mexican place for when we have the craving. BTW, the rice was uncooked."}
{"text":"This place has THE worst customer service. EVER. Not just from one employee but from all that we encountered down the assembly line. Literally everyone was rude. I couldn't remember why I hadn't been there in so many years, and now I remember! Do yourself a favor and don't go, food is not even that great for the price!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too thrilled with this place for two reasons. First, I went to the restroom before I ordered and saw an employee walk out without washing her hands. I'm sure this happens at restaurants everywhere but to see it was a turnoff.  Second, I didn't like the way the workers yelled out \"mooorre meat!\" whenever someone ordered extra meat. It was hard to enjoy a meal and talk to my friends with people yelling that the whole time.  The food was pretty decent, nothing to rave about. I also ordered the pork barbacoa salad based on the comments of many here, but found the pork too sweet for my taste. The sweetness was countered nicely by the vinaigrette dressing, however.  I think there are better places to go in the area. So I'll try them out and hope I don't hear \"mooooorre meat!\" in my head for the next few days."}
{"text":"We've always loved Café Rio.  I always order the same thing because it's so good, but I'm sure the rest of their menu is good too.  Oh, it's the pork tacos.  They're terrific!"}
{"text":"Went in on Easter Sunday and was warmly greeted brand new location but they are up to par with the typical franchise score."}
{"text":"I always get the Veggie Salad at this place. It is a great, carb filled way to end any day. Their tomatillo ranch dressing is so good that I try to hoard it for other salads through out the week.   This last time there I tried the queso for the first time. I was definitely missing out every time prior! One of the best quesos that I have ever had!   Secretly, I hoping that they will continue expanding across the country. Ok, maybe not so secretly..."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is fantastic. In Vegas on a golf vacation and stoppd in not knowing what to expect. I was suprised to find great food. Salad was awesome and huge., Added 5 meats to the salad. And barbacoa quesadilla was cheesy and full of flavor. We stuffed ourselves and went home happy. Service was great. The uoung ladies in there were very fun and helpful. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Let's start on a positive note: their food is good. The reason why I'm giving this place 1 stars is because of HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Staff here is so rude and disorganized. Their process is broken. I really wish I could go in there one day and at least get some decent service."}
{"text":"The stars on are for the delicious food, fresh ingredients, and the attentive staff... Specially the lady that keeps calling you 'my friend'. The stars off are for the high prices on the delicious food, the extra fee for the fresh ingredients, and the lady that makes an effort to call you  'honey', but makes no effort to disclose the extra charges ***BE AWARE WHEN YOU ORDER**** they charge extra for the sour cream, the dressing, the guacamole, and every other tiny thing it seems. I ordered a burrito that was only $7.99 on the menu, but somehow became a $13 item by the time of check out :/ I was almost in shock when I got the price. It feels almost like a bait and switch. No restaurant manager should ever be proud that people think they have a bait and switch. This happens only when they don't care. But mostly likely they don't even read the reviews either because no restaurant owner should ever be content with a 3 stars restaurant. If that was the case, they would know how important the reviews are. If they don't care, I personally don't either. It's a shame, because they do have fresh ingredients, great taste and a cool staff, but oh well."}
{"text":"I found this place on accident and glad I did. I enjoyed the fresh tortillas and the way they prepared ones food. This place comes highly recommend. Well that's if you are looking for some cool Mexican food done a different way; while in Las Vegas. They are a bit expensive for the amount of food you get, but it was good."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is  no good at ALL.  Very disappointed with cafe rio. I don't even know where to start. The tortilla's where not cooked or even heated up. Apparently they have never heard of carnitas! The tortilla was soaked in salsa. I picked it up, and it feel apart. The guacamole was missing salt and onion. Expensive for garbage! trust me don't go here! to top it of, there is no salsa bar. it's a bunch of salsas in a bottle u can get a grocery store. will never go to this place again. I don't even know how they can consider themselves a Mexican restaurant! they have alot of learning to do. trust me, skip this place. If you are looking for good mexican food go to taco y taco  ( in the shopping center of tropicana and pecos ) or El Panzon tacos y tortas ( in the shopping center on  sunset  and sand mill )."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because as a fan of Chipotle, my boyfriend would not stop talking about this place! Since going last week, he has (thankfully) not mentioned it as of late.  This place is similar to Chipotle in the way you order your food. You go down the line and let 'em know what you want added to your burrito, salad, etc. A neat little trick is that all the employees yell \"double meat\" or \"big meat\" or something like that when you order double meat. Hearing them yell in unison is almost worth the price of the double meat; it makes me laugh.   Even on a Thursday, this place was packed. I couldn't even believe it! I thought to myself, \"Man, this place must be good!\" Surprisingly, it was.   PROS -You can refill your own drinks -Quick service, even though it was crowded -AWESOME, AWESOME sweet pork barbacoa (They got an extra star for this.) -They don't charge for guacamole like Chipotle  CONS -The fire grilled chicken is nothing special  I'm gonna stop by here soon for lunch, maybe I'll see you guys there!  P.S. If you love froyo, stop by Yogoyum next door."}
{"text":"This can be hit or miss....the line when busy moves super slow and the line staff seems indifferent to the clients sometimes. Actually caught the supervisor disciplining the staff infront of the restaurant about their break times. The food was okay."}
{"text":"We are so happy that café Rio opened in our area! We have eaten there twice now and their sweet pork is some of the best I have ever had. Because this is a new restaurant it is extremely busy, but very worth the wait. It will run you about $30 for chips and salsa, two entrées, and two drinks. It is a little on the pricey side but still worth it. I definitely recommend the sweet pork and Tomatillo salsa and sauce!"}
{"text":"First and last time I try this place. It was supposed to be taco Tuesday. I ordered 3 Grilled Chicken and was given 4.....I told the person behind the counter and she was nice enough to tell me they won't charge me for the last one. So I thought they were $1.95 each as advertised. When I checked out he told me there was a surcharge $1 for the Grilled Chicken. I told the male Cashier they never told me that he still charged me. Well...I told him I'll never be back to this place again and walked out. I get home he gives me Habanero sauce and charges me a $1 for it when I never even ordered it....and my receipt says DineIn which charges me tax. I told the man it was to go and even had to pack it in a bag for him...he couldn't even do that part of his job. I'm not sure what's going on at this place why services so lousy and the food is not that great to begin with....will not return!"}
{"text":"I love their food and their tres leche dessert.  I would give them a better review except they don't have a functioning whip cream machine and haven't for YEARS!  Buy some cans from freaking grocery store!    I now bring my own whip cream and strawberries."}
{"text":"Came at 12:15 for lunch.  No steak.  My husband doesn't eat any of their meats except the steak.  We were told we could wait twenty minutes for them to make more.  There was enough \"left\" to make one scrawny taco that cost five dollars for steak, cheese, and sour cream.  Unacceptable.  We won't be back unless something seriously improves."}
{"text":"I had written a poor review(see below) but have given them another chance and the service and food quality have greatly improved.  I am a fan again.   Previous Review: I placed an online order to be picked up at 4:45, as my cashier was helping me a younger girl yelled at me for showing up to early....  I asked her to let the cashier help me instead of yelling across the restaurant that I was too early(the attention was embarrassing).  My order was ready, she was confused.  As I checked out they informed me my wife added quesadillas, and I said I don't think she called, the lady practically forced me to take them.  Turns out my wife never called, they gave me somebody else's food.  I love guacamole, but I don't dare to eat this brown stuff they call guacamole.  My wife tried it and immediately warned me not to eat it, as it tasted bad.  I have eaten at Cafe Rio in Utah and other locations in Nevada and this doesn't even seem like the same restaurant.  Whoever is the owner of this location should be ashamed at the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience here this past Friday evening. I came to your restaurant at around 10:20 PM and was very rushed. They surved be old food, treated me disrespectfully and I was very disappointed with the entire situation."}
{"text":"Service was good, clean restaurant. I simply did not like the food. Everything was sweet. The \"spicy pork\" (not spicy- and I didn't order the sweet pork)..the salsas were all sweet (tried them all) even the nacho cheese was sweet. I couldn't eat my meal. I was excited to try the juices, and the limeade and lemonade were both awful. I wish they had an option for unflavored limeade, and lemonade sweetened with regular sugar, not stevia. I picked off my friends plate (who ate about 1/3 of their burrito) and the steak was good, so I'll give them that. Also, the beans were good. Not enough to bring me back unfortunately"}
{"text":"I'm no longer surprised by the 2.5 stars averaged by this location. The last two times we've come have been pretty abysmal.  The first time we got shorted a burrito on a take out order. We went back for it only to get a cold and soggy mess. No offer to remake it.  Second time was another take out order. I ordered online at 6:45 for a 7:15 pickup. Got there a few minutes early and let them know I was there. It wasn't that busy so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. Wait til about 7:17 and ask the cashier if it's ready and it turns out they hadn't even started it yet. Get the food around 7:25 only to be shorted another item. Wait again. Finally out the door around 7:35.  I really wouldn't have been too concerned about waiting 20 minutes, but they literally were not busy and it would have been quicker for me to get in line. It doesn't seem like anyone was designated to work on to go orders, the people in line took absolute precedence, and every interaction at the counter had to be relayed through the manager who didn't know how to expedite anything.   My family used to come here once a week. I don't see that continuing in the future."}
{"text":"This location is horrible compared to the other Cafe Rio's.  The customer service is null & void.  It doesn't exist!  The young girls are clueless....act like your bothering them when you try and order.  And the so called manager...who was an Asian Man today(12/16/15)....left a lot to be desired as well.  His customer service sucked even worse than the girls.  No wonder they're the way they are.  No training whatsoever or management skills. He was so rude 7 also rude to the girls that worked there.  They all seemed to hate to even be there! Now the food.....well.....we ordered tacos....the chicken was dry and we literally poured out of our taco a good 1/4 cup of watery liquid out of EACH TACO! It was disgusting!  Our tortilla shell broke all apart and was soggy with all this liquid.  The Beef was tough and very bland.  It says spicy....but it tasted like boiled beef.  And everything was cold!  Meat....tortilla shell....rice & beans.  This can't be safe temperatures for food!  They charge you 50 cents per topping per taco.  So if you wanted a little guac, sour cream, cheese & salsa....that's $2.00 more per taco! And they give you about a teaspoon!!!!  It's crazy!!!  I asked to try this sauce they had....turns our it was dressing....the girl puts a teaspoon full in a solo cup & says that'll be 50 cents extra!  I said ...\"Keep It.\"  I just wanted to taste it.  So anyway....It was just a horrible experience all around.  From the customer service....to the rude manager....then over paying for cold...sloppy food.  Needless to say....I will not be returning to this location...even though it's right up the road!"}
{"text":"Went in at 9:20 pm because it closes at 10. They had all the toppings put away and didn't have the red sauce. The girl who took our order was cleaning the counters for awhile before they noticed we were there. She then used the same gloves she was cleaning with to make our burritos. While she was waiting for us to tell her what she wanted she was scratching her face with the same gloves. Then touching our burritos. She asked us if we wanted cheese and she grabbed the container of cheese off the floor. All the other workers were laughing and cleaning and showing eachother things on their cell phones so no one was available to check us out for a while. I've been here many times and it was great but tonight grossed me out. I now know not to come at night."}
{"text":"I ordered steak tacos and they were swimming in water Then the attitude of only one of the younger female employees was pretty rude not only to myself but all the customers that were in line as well."}
{"text":"Over priced fast food. They run your food through a warmer that melts the cheese on top, but does not heat the food. We ate at the location and the food was at best room temperature, not what you want in a burrito. I would not recommend nor would I eat there again. $20 and no drink. The staff was friendly, that's the best I can say about Cafe Rio. Don't waste your $$$"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible, horrible service! No wait, it's a f****ng horrible service!! I will never go back to this place! Easter Sunday night, I was really happy and ready to order our food and when we were placing our orders, first the lady was talking so low that we couldn't hear her and she was dragging herself as if she's tired of working and definitely didn't want to be there. Then the cashier guy, he made it worst!! No personality, attitude problem and no customer service. I even asked him \"tired?\" And his reply was \"what do you expect, it's Sunday and I'm really tired.\"  Wtf??? I don't want to even give them a star!! To these 2 employees (night shift) at Cafe Rio on W Sahara, you should be thankful you have jobs! If you applied for it, then you should know what your getting yourselves into. and if you don't want to deal with people, find a different job!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a chain. I am not going to review the food because it's as good as it is in California and Idaho and Utah (a comment on the franchise - they're very strong at keeping the food tasting consistent and the quality high).  This location is always fairly busy. I hit it up at 1:00 PM on a Monday and waited in line for about 15 minutes. If there's a long line, it does move fast, but not lightning fast, so be patient. And be kind, don't play on your iPhone in line and hold things up. Know what you want to order (or sample) when you get up to the counter so the person behind you doesn't contemplate smacking you up the back of the head.  The employees here are pretty great for the most part. There's a few lemons in the bunch (aren't there always?) but generally they're helpful, positive and willing to let you sample (oh dear the samples).   Must do's: if you're into the whole wheat thing, ask to try one of those tortillas - they're very good. Ask for a punch card and keep it with you - after you buy 10 meals, you get one free, and somehow the free meal just tastes even better (it should taste worse, considering you've spent about $100 now at Cafe Rio. So that's where my paycheck goes)."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and frequent their restaurants! I usually frequent at least once a week. This one has been the worst by far! They are always out of something. The last 2 weeks thy have been out of chips!  a Mexican restaurant out of chips just doesn't make sense! I don't know if it's because the manager isn't their or what? Just seems like a bunch of young kids kinda hanging out. Please get your stuff together!"}
{"text":"I will always be loyal to the pork salad w/ house dressing, shredded lettuce, black beans. There is truly no reason to order anything else, as this is one of the best meals you could possibly hope for. The line speaks for itself. Again, no words can explain the phenomenon that is this salad, I rest my case. :P"}
{"text":"Compared to the Henderson locations this one is slow, dirty and less friendly. Only writing more because Yelp is requiring it."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times now. I usually get either fire grilled steak burrito or I get the fire grilled chicken one. I love it enchilada style with spicy sauce is BOMB. Service is always good people are friendly. I have not been dissapointed ever in going here. I highly reccomend"}
{"text":"My sis brought me here last night. She said that you can only get Shrimp Tacos from Cafe Rio on Saturday nights, and well, she just had to have them. I love trying new places, so I was game.  The place was busy on a Saturday night, but it didn't take too long for us to get our order. At Cafe Rio you have to stand in line, and then they assemble the food right in front of you--kind of Subway-style, but much, much better than Subway. The guy in front of us ordered extra meat, and the whole kitchen crew yelled \"EXTRA MEAT!\" Kind of cool. We were entertained anyway...but then we are easily amused.  Since my sis never finishes her meals, I knew I was going to be able to try the Shrimp Tacos; so I went for something else. I decided to try a Pork Barbacoa Burrito. Now, at the time I was thinking \"spicy pork,\" but I guess now it makes a lot of sense that \"barbacoa\" translates to \"barbecue,\" and that would explain the sweet taste to that meat...but I'll get to that.  The portions are generous, and the energy of Cafe Rio is fun. So far, so good. My sis's Shrimp Tacos (breaded, fried shrimp) were, as promised, VERY good. My burrito...? Well, it was okay. The Barbacoa had a sweet taste to it I wasn't prepared for, and the \"hot\" sauce I had them put in my burrito was not very hot at all. That would have been a nice balance to the sweet, but it wasn't meant to be. The tortilla was freshly made though, and the other ingredients in the burrito were tasty. I just made a bad meat choice for me. You may like it if you prefer your burrito to have a \"Manwich\" type flavor. I do not.  Overall, I liked the place. I still enjoyed my sweet-tasting burrito, and I helped myself to some of my sis's tacos [again, I'm not the guy you want to sit next to at dinner]. I would go back...I will go back, actually...and when I do, it will be on a Saturday and I will order the Shrimp Tacos!"}
{"text":"This review isn't for the food, it is for the service. The food at Cafe Rios is pretty standard. We all have our favorites, etc.  Today, I was at Cafe Rio picking up a quick dinner. The first server who made my tacos was very pleasant, asked me about my day, and took my order correctly. The second server who added my lettuce, etc. was where the service fell short.   I am allergic to avocado. It's a strange allergy, and it is one that I take a chance on every time I eat a Mexican restaurant and almost every other restaurant. I liken it to the peanuts allergy. You can look ahead and see if it is in something.   I ordered sour cream on the side, but some guacamole had fallen into the sour cream dish, and the server had scooped that into the sour cream container. I asked him to redo it that the guacamole could not touch the sour cream. He obliged but not without a sigh.    When I got up to the register to pay, my side of sour cream was missing. The cashier asked this same waiter to do a thing of sour cream again. She brings one over with guacamole in the container with sour cream. I said I could not have that in my sour cream. The server, again, mixed the two together. The cashier did not seem to understand my point until I made a point that I needed a new container. I finally got a new container, but it was uncalled for.  The lack of service, respect, and the sighs regarding someone's allergy is disrespectful. Moreover, even if I was not allergic, this was just rude behavior."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a Cafe Rio expand to downtown! My lunch time options increased!   It's in a tight plaza, so plan ahead on parking. It might be wiser to park farther away and walk.   The lines will be long around lunchtime, but they do move fast. I love watching the tortillas being made!   My favorite is a steak quesadilla with a side of rice. Cannot go wrong with that."}
{"text":"I have eaten at cafe rio many many times except this location on Tatum and cactus. I've never felt so under appreciated at cafe rio. Terrible experience. If you want to enjoy the cafe rio that's amazing that I've come to know, DO NOT GO TO THIS ONE. The med green sauce is the best unless you come here and are told an hr before closing, this is what we have. Are you kidding me. There is more to the story but I'm to tired to keep talking about it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are big fans of Cafe Rio and usually go to the one on S. Eastern but since the majority of my day is spent in the University area, I decided to make a quick stop in for their Tuesday lunch special: Coconut grilled shrimp tacos with a mango sauce.  Yes, it does taste as good as it sounds.  I've actually had this special in the past, and it seems that each time I have it, they changed something about the recipe. First their shrimp tacos were about as big as their salmon tacos (which they used a tortilla size between the burrito and the regular taco, maybe something the size of a wall clock face?), but now their tortillas are the small regular taco-sized ones that are always homemade. Before, their shrimp was a coconut-incorporated batter where the shrimp were fried till crunchy, but now they're grilled with huge pieces of shredded coconut on them in a sauce I couldn't quite discern.  It was mighty tasty though, and although I missed the crunch of a fried shrimp, I did prefer the up in flavor factor that these new shrimp had.    The special (and pretty much anything else you order) comes with a nice helping of rice and beans, which haven't changed much in my opinion, and they taste fine but definitely aren't my preference.  The black beans are much better than the pinto, I think, but this rice reminds me more of a rice pilaf than anything else.   Among other things, I'd recommend the salmon taco, which I prefer with the cilantro-ranch dressing, or any of their salads which are huge and come laid atop a burrito-sized tortilla with melty cheese on it.  The boyfriend loves their burritos as they come served \"wet\" with enchilada sauce on top, but I kind of think the burritos are overrated and enough to feed 2-3 people with a normal appetite. Actually, pretty much everything comes in proportions enough to serve 2-3 people with a normal appetite, but who are we kidding right? Vegas is a town where the locals love their food and tend to eat like we're practicing for a food competition. Take no shame, fellow Vegas locals. Life's too short to not enjoy food from a place as tasty as Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Chipotles is one of my favorites, but this place was even better!  The place is bright, clean, attractive and the food is super fresh.  The portions are generous and the price reasonable.  It was our first time there.  I didn't think I would like mint limeade, but once I tried it, it was amazing.  I would go back for just that!"}
{"text":"Tried to give this Cafe Rio a chance, but its a fail. Consistently no ice for drinks, today there is no avocado and I get charged full price, and the bathroom area by the drink station frequently smells like a sewer. The staff usually displays an indifferent attitude as well. Maybe a management change is in order? I will never come to this location again. Im usually the one not to complain.....but there are improvements that need to be made...like yesterday."}
{"text":"Living in Buffalo I never get to eat here anymore and I miss it so much! I wish they would open one here!! All my friends love it.  The pork is so good and the dressing never fails. It's yummy in my tummy and I will always go here whenever I'm in the West, but please open one in Buffalo, NY!!!x"}
{"text":"Love the sweet pork. I even had it at my wedding. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars are the price and the too-fast paced assembly line that you have to go through to order your food. Other than that, I love it!"}
{"text":"Dont bother calling in your order to save time waiting in line. If i would have just gotten in line, i would have been out of here and eating at home already. But i ordered 45 mins ago and im still waiting-- they ran out of rice and then they ran out of beans. But im standing here waiting as the 'manager' says 'its almost ready' and im aatching the huge line off people walk away with their food, no problem. What-the-actual-fuck?!   Worst Cafe Rio. E V E R"}
{"text":"Not consistent here like other Cafe Rios in Las Vegas with food quality or offering military discounts. Two week's ago offered and today not. Without a doubt, the dryest fish taco I have ever had. However, real fish as I found an 1-inch bone in my fish taco. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Very busy and crowded restaurant for lunch. Went with a group and needed to get orders to go in order to make it back on time from a one hour break, Long line, staff moves very fast. Colleague said her enchilada was cold. I ordered the salad with a very fresh, homemade tortilla bowl. Salmon was seasoned well over the salad. Lots to choose from, very filling meal, decent prices. Outdoor dining in great spot with lots of surrounding shops."}
{"text":"Came in here on march 19th around 7:30 to pick up a Togo order I placed online. When I got there it was really busy and my order wasn't ready. The girl working the front was sooooooo kind and apologized and comped one of my entrees. She was so sweet and apologetic which made the experience great. I could tell she was overwhelmed but she still did a great job. I didn't catch her name but she was younger probably 17 or 18 and had light red hair and fair skin."}
{"text":"Made an order 20 minutes prior to arrival on the app, was declined 5 minutes before closing because all employees were all sitting down at the table eating food. I was told \"we're closed\", I mentioned that they weren't and employee responded with \"we're out of food\". So either restock on food to where it is available all day up until it actually closes, or don't allow giant dinners before closing that includes every employee."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and average at best. Even if you like chipotle or rubios less than this place, I think they both are better and cheaper the service and overall act like they care is almost non existent this is on 4 separate occasions not just once wouldn't return is my gurl didn't like them so much"}
{"text":"Came in the other day, I ordered online to pick up my order, I waited like 10 minutes no biggie but I ordered the chips and guacamole and when I opened the guacamole...I thought it was salsa, I was like so upset because I wanted guacamole but I said it's okay it happens then I dipped the chip in and it was guacamole?!?! Looked so brown and old and gross I really thought it was like brown salsa but when I smelled it , it was guacamole lol I was so grossed out and the food was kinda hard and I was just sad I spent like 15$ to just throw it in the trash"}
{"text":"We love the food here, but every time we order online for food to go we have to wait 15 minutes past the time it's supposed to be ready. It's incredibly frustrating.  We come and it's not very busy, but have to wait 15 minutes for our to-go-order..cmon! Please fix this cafe rio!!"}
{"text":"My burrito was given to someone else and I caught the mistake. Then our chips were not cooked so we asked for done ones and the manager comes back with a smart alec answer telling his cooks we want them extra crispy. No buddy, we just don't want them raw!!! The drive to Stephanie is world it. When you get the right food though it is very good."}
{"text":"Extra cheese! I like cheese extra extra cheese - ask for extra cheese and this is the fun song they will sing.  Amazing food and even better service.  Sample the meats before you choose! Sweet barbacoa is the best!    Cons- extra charge for Sour cream.  No powerade on fountain :("}
{"text":"Went to eat with the family and found a hunk of copper wire in our food!!! I took it to the manager and she said \"oh that's from our strainers\". When I asked if anything was going to be done about it since that could have sliced open the inside of her mouth had she bit down, the manager told me, \"she can't help what gets into the food\". At this point I felt that the manner in which she handled the situation was completely inappropriate (still had not apologized). When I asked if she was going to do anything she said, \"I can take down your name and if you go to the doctors for her injury we will pay for it\" ... Seriously?! This is disgusting and was not handled correctly at all. Don't eat at this location if they are this careless and \"can't help what falls into the food\". Never again!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I always get their shredded chicken tacos and I am never disappointed about the quality of the food this location serves.   My issue, however, is that my order is always prepared incorrectly every time I go in. I always order the two taco meal with an extra taco and they always try to charge me for three separate tacos and separate rice and beans. I have to explain to literally every person in the assembly line what I had ordered and it still comes out wrong in the end. You HAVE to tell them you want that extra taco \"a la carte\" or they will NOT get it right. They will also miss topping additions you ask for. They are definitely rushing to clear out the line and they miss things because of it. You really have to tell them multiple times what you want.   They also call their salsa verde something else which I ALWAYS forget! And if you don't ask for it in that name, they say they don't have it. Even though it is right there. In front of their face. It drives me batty!!  I would like to emphasize again though how good those chicken tacos are and even though they mess up a lot, I still go back."}
{"text":"Very rude staff, and they don't know how to stock food based on their hours. Very annoying."}
{"text":"I have had numerous bad experiences at this location. I've had several pick up orders that were either wrong or missing items and the customer service is terrible. Tonight I waited well past my pickup time and had to ask twice about my order only for them to discover it was sitting on the shelf the whole time and later I discovered it was missing the dessert that I paid for."}
{"text":"I tried them back to back days and the food was ok.  The place was packed so that is a good thing.  Like others have said it is like Chipotle using fresh ingredients.  I ordered on their app and it worked just fine, and then I went and picked it up.  Day one I tried the chicken enchiladas and steak tacos.  Day two I tried the pork and pulled beef enchiladas. The chicken enchiladas were loaded with good quality white meat chicken, but it had not seasoning or flavor.  The pork enchiladas was very sweet and I hated that.  I like spicy not sweet.  The pulled beef enchilada was the best of them.  It had good flavor.  The beans and rice were really good.  I didn't like all the lettuce and cilantro they through on top.  Way to much.  Maybe it was a garnish.The steak tacos were pretty good too.  I just felt I've had just as good for a lesser price.  It was $10 for two steak street tacos. I can get just as good at other places for $3-$4 each.     They also do not have anything spicy.  I asked for their hot sauce and was charged $1 for a little cup of something that was not spicy at all.  They will nickle and dime you if you want extra's I noticed, on top of the food already being over priced."}
{"text":"Going vegetarian this week and splurged on some bean and cheese nachos! They were delicious! Especially when you add the quest sauce to them! Yes please. Lost that extra star because this location is always out of corn tortillas! Sad sad day! My poor son is allergic to flour so he was bummed! Other than that they can tidy up the dinning room but they are pretty square!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and thought I would give it a try, especially since there was a long line. Their food and service had to good!  I always look to try new food when I go out of town. I was so wrong with this place. The line moved at an okay pace, considering their menu appeared to be fairly simple. However, their menu boasts various items with fish. So I thought I would give one a try. I was forewarned that there was a 15 min wait on the fish.  I accepted the wait and proceeded with my order. I saw the fish on the grill and thought it couldnt be that bad and I didn't hear anyone before me order fish.  Well that 15 min wait turned into 30!!!! I asked them 5 times about my order each time I got an \"it's coming\" or \"5 mins\" or \"2 more mins\"   All the while,  I am watching them process other orders and barely able to keep those straight. A relative who was with me asked for some sort of compensation for the wait. An employee offered a free drink, but never gave us the cup. Finally just as I decided to ask for a refund, my order came through. The cashier told me he put an extra vinaigrette for my salad to compensate me for the wait....REALLY?!?!  GEE THANKS!!!! Needless to say, I won't be coming back.....I did give it 2 stars. In spite of the wait my food still looked good (I am all about presentation) but taste wise  it wasn't anything to get excited about.  If you must go, I STRONGLY suggest you call your order in and take it to go especially if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"Well, after finding a buy one get one coupon I decided to give Cafe Rio a try. Home made tortillas made right in front of you and a similar line to Chipotle. I got the salad, my son the burrito both with shredded chicken. AWESOME.....salad was great, my son loved the burrito. Cafe Rio just moved up to his #2 favorite Mexican spot. Food was good, and I have one more coupon left, so I'll be stopping by again this week before it expires!   Thumbs up.....worth the stop. My bill was $9.15 for both with the coupon. YEAH!!"}
{"text":"53 minutes in line - wth?  Manager said its because of the to go orders. Don't come here unless you have an hour and a half to kill."}
{"text":"First off I am a big fan of Cafe Rio normally, however, this location just doesn't seem to have it going on. I feel like they skimp I the trimmings. I always order the tortilla soup and I've been twice around 3pm and they are already sold out. After waiting in the line too! Then they didn't put the guacamole or give me the tortilla to go with :-( I still go but I have to be very specific to tell them how it's to be made, even though every other location does it correctly."}
{"text":"Let's get straight to the point. This is one of the biggest burritos I've ever seen. Lol. Felt like I had a 5lb weight in my bag.  What I don't understand is why can't they put all the stuff into the burrito? I don't want my guacamole and sour cream on the side. What am I supposed to do...dip my burrito? Is this done for speed purposes? It's just weird. Having enchilada sauce on a burrito is also weird. Turns everything into a wet mess! I like burritos because it's a handheld meal...not when it's covered in sauce and cheese.  Even though most of that was complaining, it didn't taste so bad.  Lol. Picked up a veggie burrito and it lasted me a couple days...that doesn't happen in chipotle.  Will I return? It's open late so most likely."}
{"text":"This place is a hot mess. Not a good one either. We have problems every single time we go here. Typically we always order online and the order is never correct, not to mention that the customer service sucks. They truly could care less if they make an error on the order. I seriously love the food that cafe rio has, but only when made correctly. Choose a different location before you drive here, trust me!"}
{"text":"This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER. The ingredients are fresher and pack way more flavor. They make everything in front of you, so you can get it exactly the way you want it. The tortillas are even better too!!  My favorite: The sweet pork barbacoa salad! AMAZING! It's a pulled pork  that's marinated in this sweet tangy BBQ sauce that is really different from your normal mexican spices or even your southern BBQ flavors. YUM! And my favorite part: they pile the salad high. My recommendation is to get the vinegrette dressing which is basically clianto and lime. Absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"First time having Cafe Rio... When I walked in I was excited, it looked like some real Mexican food, making fresh tortillas in front of you etc... However, the enchiladas were not as good as the ones I make at home, so for like $13 (with my soda) I did not think it was worth the price at all."}
{"text":"This location is the worst! The customer service is the worst . Especially when you find out the manager Claudia is the rudest of them all as she works the line. The worst customer service I have even experience. She literally held up the salsa and dropped it on the top of the food that she was making! Really, if you don't like your job get another one. I will be calling the district manager and making sure that she doesn't continue to treat people that way! Save yourself the trouble go to another location!"}
{"text":"It seems as if there have been some staffing changes. The line has been moving quicker and they have not been out of ingredients the last 2 times. My most recent visit was the best yet!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the way they work their line is crazy. I'm not even in front of the tortilla stand and they're asking me for my order. I have to shout my order through the plexiglass, meanwhile I feel like I'm dry humping the guy in front of me because were so close because of such in a rush to take the order."}
{"text":"Horrible employees... First off let me say that we have been here before and loved the food. This time however we get there at 9:03pm and the doors were unlocked so we still went in. As soon as we get to the line an employee shouted \"don't you know we are closed (loud and rude), we are out of tortillas, chicken and everything else... As I'm looking at a stack of tortillas... So we walked out being and went to Roberto's. Who ever is in charge of that place really needs to get control of their employees"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant more stars because I have always liked Cafe Rio, but the service has gone down hill. I placed my order before hand, told the young lady over the phone that I wanted red sauce and a chili relleno with no meat, 4 times! I also stated I wanted a side of the medium sante fe green chili sauce. Well guess what, it was wrong. When we got to the restaurant, she stated that the chili rellenos only came one way and she stated, \"I was going to call you but I didn't\" so we then ordered cheese enchiladas instead of the chili rellenos with RED sauce. Mind you again, I ordered red and said cheese multiple times. We get home open up the containers, the enchiladas were not red sauce, they were green, again I ordered them with red sauce. The sauce I ordered in the side was supposed to be sante fe medium sauce, it was tomatillo. Called in, the managers response was oh she's not familiar with the sauces. Not familiar with the sauces? She works at Cafe Rio! I then go to eat the enchiladas and they have chicken in them. If they only serve items with meat, they need to tell customers. I called back again, the manager still acted like it was no big deal and didn't care. Customer service means a lot to me and the fact that you can't take care of customers, is total incompetence!"}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty food, but no table service or margaritas. You walk up & order. We really need a Mex place exactly like this but with waiters & a bar. Or... add a drive thru"}
{"text":"By far the worst location. ALWAYS over a 20-25 min wait in line. Then when you get up to order they're ALWAYS out of product. I would rather drive 20 min to another location than go this one. Countless times rice is under cooked, out of queso, out of grilled chicken, out of salsa. Whatever is going on should be fixed fast. IF YOURE ON A LUNCH BREAK DONT GO HERE. IF YOU WANT WHAT YOU ORDERED DONT GO HERE. The only thing I can say is it has a clean lobby"}
{"text":"I am giving this location a 1 star based on the fact that every time we go they are out of multiple items. The past 4 times we have gone they are out of grilled steak, that's what I order and don't really feel that I should have to settle for something I'm paying for. They run out and stop grilling  steak and chicken as much as 2.5 hours before they close!! That to me is crazy. If you offer an item then it's your responsibility to make sure you keep it stocked and replenished up till closing time. They run out of guac, last time they ran out of salsa! And the frustrating thing is the amount of people that are \"working \" behind the counter!! As many as 8-12!! And they still run out. Neither the staff or the manager seem to care, their response is \" sorry\" that's it. I have , many times just left. If we go there to get our favorites, we shouldn't have to settle for something we don't really want. Do yourself a favor, if you want to get good Mexican food from this type of restaurant, drive 5 miles and go to Costa Vida. The staff is always friendly and they have never ran out of anything in the past 5 years I've been going."}
{"text":"New Location. Clean. Ordered the burrito, For $9 I was disappointing in the amount of meat, and a lot of filler ( Rice & Beans). Friendly people, Had some issues communicating my order, they peppered me with choices too fast and didn't explain what they were asking. Seemed very rushed."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is always trumped by the absolutely terrible service. My orders have constantly been wrong, cold, and over charged and the staff comes across as completely apathetic. The only reason this location gets the second star is that the location does seem to be clean and well presented, but it truly is a gilded facade and nothing more."}
{"text":"This is not even based on the food, but the fact that a grown man behind the counter said to his staff at least 6 different times out loud \"I'd appreciate it if you all would shut the f#$& up\", speaking to everyone working behind him. This all while myself and another person ordered and waited for our food. Disrespectful to those he's working with and they don't deserve that."}
{"text":"***PLEASE READ UNHYGIENIC EXPERIENCE ***  I dont normally write reviews because some things just don't get to me but earlier today I went to this location as I was standing in line I observed the cleanliness of the place. The sauces were everywhere it was really filthy, understandable the place is packed and really busy. The lady who'd take my order to was wearing gloves and cleaning the counter as she took my order SHE TOUCHED MY TORTILLA AND CHEESE WITH THE SAME GLOVES SHE USED TO TOUCH THE DIRTY WET TOWEL SHE CLEANED THE COUNTER WITH  DISGUSTING!!!! I was observing her before my order waiting for her to change her gloves before touching food BUT SHE DID NOT, SO DISGUSTING AND FILTHY!!!! PLEASE YOU GUYS, PLEASE OBSERVE HOW THEY HANDLE YOUR FOOD. I LOVE CAFE RIO BUT I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION  BTW i ordered a flan with my order, they told me theyd have it ready and serve it to me, I waited for 30 mins. turns out she forgot!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love Cafe Rio until today. I found a DEAD LADY BUG  in my salad. GROSS!!! when I went to tell the manager and show her she just stood there with nothing to say. Not even a sorry out of her mouth.  Not going back.... :("}
{"text":"Love everything I've ordered at Cafe Rio. Their enchiladas are as good as any mexican restaurant and their queso dip is probably better. Also love that you can order online ahead of time and pick up to go."}
{"text":"So gross the guacamole was grey. The ingredients are not fresh nor are they flavorful. Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"What makes this place so good is their homemade tortillas! I am picky when it comes to tortillas but this is the real deal! One of the best salads I've ever had!  My Favorites: Pork Barbacoa Salad (No Beans, No Rice) w/ Half House Dressing & Half Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette"}
{"text":"It's crazy how this place is ALWAYS out of something. Usually it's something big too like grilled chicken. My GF likes the food--I think it's ok--but I really despise the shrug of the shoulders the kid behind the counter gives me when he tells me they're out of something. I swear to god every time I go in there (10+ times at least) there's an employee eating in the dining room which I find very unprofessional. The kids are friendly at least."}
{"text":"Love cafe rio, but my Togo orders are always messed up. Paid for extra sauce and got none!"}
{"text":"Never had anything bad!  First choice: tortilla soup... Perfectly filling and not as high on calories as some other menu items.  Second choice: chx nachos aghhhh so bad for you but oh so good! Perfect to share! Like I said before everything is amazing!  Pork is awesome as well perfectly sweet! Salads are freshtastic and depending on what you get on it they actually can be healthy.  Substitute the dressing for salsa fresca just as delicious! If dining in try the strawberry lemonade...yummy.  The only thing I can say is... I actually never had dessert from here.  This is my go to place!"}
{"text":"I know why this place has 2 1/2 stars! The food is great but the service and food preparation is inconsistent and slow.  Not to mention unfriendly.  We have given them a variety of tries, won't be going back. The one on eastern is terrific!!! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"First off, why are all the yelpers hating on cafe rio, yet you guys still go there? I wonder......anyway, cafe rio is my go to spot for a steak quesadilla. It's better than places like robertos and etc. Its quicker, and honestly, the service has always been great. Don't believe all the other yelpers! Give this place an honest try. You would most likely leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"So the only thing stopping me from giving this Cafe Rio a 4 or even maybe a 5 star rating is the fact that if you end up in the back of the line (10-12 people deep) you're looking at a 30 minute wait to give your order. Now I know a lot of people have given poor reviews here but lucky enough for me I have only been given the best customer service and quantity of food. I really do enjoy the flavors and options on the menu. I usually order the burritos but I have tried many things including the tacos, quesadillas, and Salads. I was impressed with all of them. I think one of my favorite things about this place is that they make the tortillas right behind the glass fresh. I would highly recommend Cafe Rio to anyone looking for some good food."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite because the staff is FAST, EFFICIENT, and FRIENDLY!!  My tostada is always prepared just the way I like it.  They have a great crew who work coherently together to please their hungry customers.  I can't get enough of this place and would go breakfast, lunch and dinner if I could!  The best tasting, freshest, and healthiest salads to go or dine-in.  It's inexpensive and you get a ton of food for your $.  Don't forget to use your punch card every time you go and you'll receive the 10th meal free!"}
{"text":"Ordered burrito on app at 6:45 Store said it would be ready at 7:00 Show up at 7:10 Pay at 7:16 Cashier says \"it will be right out\" *watches cashier print out receipt and put order in queue* Order finally ready at 7:25  The entire reason someone would order on the app is to avoid waiting 15 minutes at the store. Improve your process or you will lose business as there's no shortage of burrito places in the area."}
{"text":"Oh Café Rio, please come to NJ.  I did email you to ask, but like letting down the \"not-so-cool\" kid when he asks you to the prom, you said no! My wife and I stop here every trip to Vegas. Recently it was our first stop after getting off the plane at 8pm.  Fresh tortillas, sweet pork burrito (enchilada style), a cold drink, and a seat outside....what more can you ask for. The service is a 10+, the employees are super nice and helpful. The price seems a bit high but I will not complain; it is well worth it.  Just one more stamp for the freebie!! I got to get to Vegas again soon!  Please come to NJ!!!!"}
{"text":"Garbage I enjoy Cafe Rio the summerlin location is good. This one just missed the mark on so many levels. Out of grilled chicken whatttt. Didn't offer guacamole or sour cream and to top it off ran out of rice and didn't attempt to make it right. Sad sad sad. Will not return ever. *Food poisoned smh very agrivating"}
{"text":"Staffing get it together. Food is good service is not. Maybe offering the positions to more of a medley of individuals I sense the teams has mutenyed it's unfortunate"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was okay. Cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Food and spilled drinks on the floor, drink area disgusting. Staff didn't step foot outside of the kitchen area while we were dining in to check on dining area or wipe down tables."}
{"text":"We had a little mix up on our to go order so when I called to get a refund I talked to a girl named Taylor, she was very polite and helped me right away. Thanks girl !"}
{"text":"This location can certainly do better. It's kind of off putting because they seem to always have new staff, and I think most aren't really trained into compliance for the health department. I just noticed a line guy touch his jeans with his gloves on and then touch the lettuce he put on customers burrito. His attitude, as well as the female line worker next to him, were pretty disappointing. They weren't really rude, it just seemed like both of them really didn't want to be there. The attitude didn't really factor into my review tho. The food at this location for some reason, is not as good as the other cafe Rios. The steak in my quesadilla just tasted really chewy."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio in general always has a weird, stress filled atmosphere to me. I figured I would try this new location today for lunch though because I like the food.  I waited over a 1/2 hr in line for a salad. The to go orders were more important than mine apparently. They don't manage the line very well. One person doing a majority of the work is what slowed everything down. The girl who was taking our order was also doing to-go orders. One guy finally stepped in and took my order to get me my food. It's disorganized and it was only 11:30 am."}
{"text":"I'm giving the stars because of the food, but everyone that worked there was so rude! I will not be coming back thanks to how rude and cold the staff was there."}
{"text":"Food was ok. We were the only ones in line and there were 4 employees who looked bored and staring into space. We waited for 10 minutes to order. I ordered a cup of tortilla soup. They put an entire lime slice in it and the whole cilantro with stem. I have this soup many times else where and would expect they they would squeeze the lime juice not just throw it in the soup and also pull the cilantro leaves off of the stems. It was odd finding both of them like this in my soup. Also, it was like warm. My daughter didn't like her food and asked for something else. The girl working the cashier is who she told and she said she would make a quesadilla for her. A few minutes later she came to our table and said did she still want a quesadilla. I said yes. She said she needed to tell the cook. I said ok then she walked away and said I'll do it. Overall, we will not be returning. We came for a school fundraiser."}
{"text":"I think the food is okay. For those that do not eat Mexican frequently like myself, it was a bit challenging to put something together not really knowing what goes in what. I have tried a few things, the tostada (got really soggy) nachos, tacos, etc. Nothing to me that was so amazing that I would go back. The chips with queso were my favorite. I get what they say about service. I felt like a chicken with my head cut off ordering for the first few times. The employees could certainly be more patient and welcoming. I also get what they say about messes. It is super messy when they just slop things on your plate."}
{"text":"I am normally a huge cafe rio fan but my last visit has put a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figuratively). I ordered a chicken burrito with a side of guacamole. When I arrived home I noticed the guacamole is light to dark brown. I tried to eat some thinking it may have just sat out for a minute to long, but no it was grotesque. I called the restaurant multiple times and I got a busy tone. When I finally got a hold of someone they told me the manager was busy and to call back in 15 minutes?!? I gave them my information and asked if the manager could call me when they were available. I received no call. What kind of pathetic excuse for customer service is going on?"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and order from them all the time but why is it whenever I call in an order they ALWAYS forget my dressing for my salad. What good is a salad without the dressing. I'm hoping management reads this and does something about the workers not fully checking orders before bagging them. I always check when I pick up but even when I Postmates an order I get it without dressing."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy.  No matter I order, it's always great tasting.  Love their chips.  The customer service is a little hit and miss.  I think that's because they are always busy and in rush mode."}
{"text":"Another example of a very poorly run Cafe Rio. Where are you finding your managers from?! Today's shining example was a manager unwilling to budge and honor the price that their employee offered.   I wanted to try the shrimp tacos, which were on their daily special. I asked specifically if I could order them ala carte like the regular tacos. I was told yes. When I got to the register, they tried to charge me the price of the tacos as a meal. I told them no, I ordered them ala carte. Long story short, they couldn't ring them out that way. Manager refused to honor the price by ringing them out as another type of taco. THEN THE MANAGER WOULD NOT EVEN COME SPEAK WITH ME FACE TO FACE, EVEN AFTER SEVERAL REQUESTS FROM HER STAFF. She just sat in her office and relayed messages to me via her cashier. I asked her staff to ask her if she would rather just lose the sale and waste the food because I wasn't going to purchase them as a meal. Her one word answer, \"Yes.\"  Her blatant disregard for customer service is a shining example of what's broken with Cafe Rio as a Company.   Thank goodness there are plenty of Chipotle's close by, and a couple new Costa Vida's as well. They seem to actually like their customers and and treat them well.   First and last visit to this place!   Hey Cafe Rio higher ups, if you are reading this, it's a bad trend in both of your locations that I've visited. Your managers and staff need more customer service training. In a market that has plenty of competition, with reviews and ratings readily available at our finger tips, it's your service that sets you aside and keeps driving new business in or out of your locations.  ...but what do I know, I'm just a consumer looking for a place to spend my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Bad service. They pick and choose who to give exceptional service. Ripped my burrito and dumped the insides into another wrap. I know it all gets digested in the stomach anyways but \"presentation is everything!\""}
{"text":"So I got tacos today.. The meat was good and the tacos are a good size the only thing I didnt like was the tortillas .."}
{"text":"So appropriate that James Taylor's \"Mexico\" came on while I was dining here.  The lyrics include the line \"I've never really been but I'd so like to go... guess I'll have to go now.\"  There is something about the pseudo-Latin instruments and the added vocal harmonies of Crosby and Nash that makes one want to go to Mexico after listening to this ridiculously catchy song.  Pretty much sums up how I feel about this place...Mexican-American fast food fare that despite it's pseudo-authenticity, is still ridiculously tasty.  When faced with the rival options like Chipotle and Taco Bell, Cafe Rio wins hands down every time!  Freshly made tortillas cranked out on the premises, daily specials like coconut shrimp tacos and tamales, and a badass oven that takes shredded cheese sprinkled on top of a variety of dishes and transforms it into a velvety gooey blanket of melted cheese-liciousness in less than a minute, the portions are generous and one can even partake in agua frescas and horchata for beverage options.  Service is fast and the ingredients are fresh (saw a whole army of chicken breasts fired on the grill and one of their napkins claimed they squeeze over 1000 limes daily).    While I am still on a quest to search for the most tasty authentic joint that teleports me directly to Mexico, this will still be my guilty pleasure place for fast food that makes me want to go to Mexico, much like James Taylor."}
{"text":"The best tortillas I've ever had and the portions are so generous that I can't feed my family cheaper anywhere. We love the vegetarian salad and tacos and coconut shrimp tacos (Saturday only). I wish they would open for breakfast on Saturday and offer the shrimp tacos everyday."}
{"text":"The best tortillas I've ever had and the portions are so generous that I can't feed my family cheaper anywhere. We love the vegetarian salad and tacos and coconut shrimp tacos (Saturday only). I wish they would open for breakfast on Saturday and offer the shrimp tacos everyday."}
{"text":"tldr  Kinda stingy with the steak for my salad tho. Usually bomb. The place was kind of cold too. Didn't have to wait long and friendly staff.  Get: -steak salad -half creamy tomatillo dressing -half cilantro lime vinaigrette   Protip: get the black beans on the side or a separate container to prevent from tortilla sogginess."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today and won't be back. We've been to other locations and typically have a great experience. Not this location!  It was very messy when we walked in, as if they hadn't cleaned from the lunch rush. We ordered and the first employee seemed very disinterested, and I could barely hear her. I had to ask her to repeat herself several times. I finally leaned over the sneeze guard as much as I could.   We ordered vegetarian tacos. Usually the first line employee does something, but this time we were passed on to the 2nd employee. She was honestly the only employee who seemed to have any interest in her job.   When it was time to pay, I told the cashier that I had a free meal on the rewards card. I had already seen signs that stated the new rewards program on the app. But I had still purchased 10 entrees and earned a free one. When I told the cashier, she said \"oh we don't do that anymore, now it's the app\". I told her I understood, but I had still earned a free meal. She wouldn't honor it and I requested a manager. The manager took care of it, no problem. I don't understand why the previous cashier made it more difficult than it had to be.  The food tasted fine. However my spouse and I both got sick shortly after we finished our meal.   Maybe I should have seen that coming. When we used the restaurant bathroom, it was very dirty. This store needs some serious help."}
{"text":"A regular place we come for date night. Always good and staff friendly and fast. Favorite dishes are grilled chicken tostada and sweet pork burrito. The creamy dressing is the best! It's nosy but if you sit in the front corner the noise level is less."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday, I have the steak burrito enchilada style and it was amazing, also their house ranch dressing was so yummy, my friend had the sweet pork and that was also quite yummy, I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a couple of gift cards and after 10 minutes of waiting I gave up. There were 3 people in front of me in the carry out line and you could see the frustration on their faces from waiting so long and the fact that no one acknowledged we were all standing there waiting. You could hear the phone ringing and no one was answering it either. I won't be going back there for anything."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is super friendly and it's menu is easy to understand. Their queso is my favorite that I've ever had! Their taco Tuesday deal is amazing! All the different drink options are a nice refreshing change to the stereotypical options all places have. Love that you can add in your flavor syrup! Only thing I'd change is that they only have seafood on the weekends, wish they had it available every day."}
{"text":"Our first time after hearing great things about Cafe Rio. Did an online order.  I ordered extra dressings (both) and extra sour cream for my salad. I received zero extra anything. I even asked the gal that handed me the bag if the sour cream was in there and she said it was. I also had some cilantro in my salad that was black and rotted! Disgusting!  My order was to be ready at 6:15. It wasn't ready until 6:25.  No sense of urgency for the employees taking care of the customers.  It's not rocket science people, get the orders right and make sure your ingredients are fresh!  First and last time for us...we were not impressed!"}
{"text":"Simply the best tacos I have ever had!!   I ordered the fire grilled salmon tacos it comes with rice and beans. The tortillas were fresh and made right there."}
{"text":"Ooey gooey cheesy enchiladas! Veggie options available black beans for my protein. The green sauce was just spicy enough. I like their streamlined ordering process and the clear menu. There was an awesome lady making their tortilla from scratch at the beginning of the line. Lots of veggies and guac for free if you get the veg option."}
{"text":"Came in at 9:07 . The man behind the counter yelled at us telling us they were closed. Out of everything. And was just rude about the situation. I work for tips. And he was rude."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Rio.  We were regulars at the Centennial store.  Very excited when the Lake Mead store opened because it's right next to my office.    OK - the bad part.  This store has never gotten up to par.  I've gone to pick up to-go food on my way home from work (5:15-ish) multiple times and they have been completely out of chicken, completely out of steak, etc.  Today, we called in a to-go order for lunch at 11:35.  We were told to pick up the order at 12:10 but that most likely it would be ready earlier.  My son arrived at noon and had to wait until 12:30 for the food.  They had not even started on it when he got there.  Mind you it was a simple order, 1 order of nachos, 1 burrito and 2 soups.  Not a big order at all.  When I spoke with the manager, she said they were busy.  Didn't apologize or anything.  When we got the order home, they had forgotten to put the tortilla strips in with the soup.  Had we gone and waited in line, we would have had our order in minutes rather than an hour after it had been placed.    There's just no reason for this store to be so unorganized and mismanaged.  Another interesting aspect is if you call corporate to complain, they always have voicemail and never return calls.  Must be getting too many complaints."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the mood craving Mexican food I highly suggest Cafe Rio! They have different specials that change often but you can never go wrong with the specials. Sometimes I just go and get a bag of tortilla chips and their salsa plus queso. The one item I would highly HIGHLY suggest is getting a burrito enchilada style. Now I'm a heavy eater and I can't even tame this beast. From all the Cafe Rio places I've been to in Vegas all of them seem to get packed around 11am-6pm but the staff all work well as a team to make sure the line goes moving! Only reason being four stars was that there was 2 empty tables filled with trash and having the workers just leave it there, aside from that you can't go wrong. If you're a first timer I would recommend getting a burrito. For the burrito you choose either a 12\" Flour Tortilla or Wheat tortilla, then you select your protein which range from shredded chicken, grilled chicken, sweet pork barbacoa (YUMMY), roasted beef, grilled salmon, or fire grille steak. Next you choose if you want black or pinto means and rice. Make sure to get it enchilada style (they pour your choice of sauce on top of your burrito. It ranges from tomatillo (mild), green chile (medium), and red chile sauce (hot). Afterwards they'll put a salad with pico de gallo on the side."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to going here but ended up being disappointed. Had the barbacoa  burrito which was really runny and the seasoning on it I did not care for. The atmosphere was nice though."}
{"text":"Ok tried this place for the first time for lunch! I had the shredded pork salad with black beans and house dressing. Love the fresh tortilla shell. Overloaded with lettuce but hey it's a salad. The meat was sweet and Delish!  My friend ordered two tacos one beef and one chicken. Also really good.  My only and biggest complaint  and this is a Major sin. Did you not taste your Salsa? OMG so much lime juice it was horrid!  Sorry guys your taste buds must be broken. A hint of lime is good. This stuff was overpowered with it.  Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I had no idea there was pork barbacoa as I've only had steak barbacoa at other burrito places. Been here twice: lines move fast, food is mostly under $8 each, and portions are generous. Got the pork barbacoa salad both times. It's layered on a tortilla with tortilla strips sprinkled on top. To top it off, they have vanilla Coke and cherry Coke. Score!"}
{"text":"Place is 100% disgusting. There is something wrong w the employees. They expect u to know the menu. The food is legitimately disgusting"}
{"text":"Catered baby shower, food was delicious and delivered right on time, setup was professional."}
{"text":"This place is a joke ran by an incompetent staff.  Every phone order I have ever placed has been wrong.   This location is very poorly ran."}
{"text":"These people know what they're doing. It's a great efficient setup where you watch the food being made from scratch. Homemade tortillas always warrant a blue ribbon for me.  Here, they roll the dough and cook them on the huge rotating comal you observe while standing in line. Chicken is grilled fresh in front if you.  If you get a burrito, have it enchilada style.  If it weren't for the calories, I'd eat here every day. Their tres leches is the best Ive ever had, even in higher end restaurants, even though it isn't made on the premises. I have to give this place five stars despite the usual bottleneck at the cashier."}
{"text":"Love this place! Handmade burritos  are the best in town. Food is great and fresh always Mint lemonade drink is really good  Prepare to stand half an hour in line when busy"}
{"text":"My husband I recently went there because of a referral and the food was delicious and the service was great. I am so glad that we tried it."}
{"text":"Omg.... it's been a few years since I've eaten at a Cafe Rio. My boyfriend has never eaten at one (weird, I know!) But today my taste buds were in heaven! I got the habanero chicken tacos. Heaven! Add guac. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place.  Do you know that jeep saying that only jeep owners say.  \"It's a Jeep thing, you don't understand.\"  I guess Cafe Rio is the same thing.  I just don't understand why people go crazy over this place.  This restaurant is always packed.  I always end up going because I can't always pick where we eat.  Now as you read this I know what you are thinking.  This guy is just bashing this restaurant.  Ok, so I am a little.  Let's get to the food.  Is the food bad?  No  Is the food spectacular? No Is the food a little different? Yes.  This place is not your typical Mexican food joint.  I have actually tried a few different items on the menu at this establishment because I cant seem to find something I like.  My wife gets the salad with the pork.  The pork is really good.  It is the right amount of sweet and tender.  This place also makes there own tortillas, which is always a plus.  The salad comes with your choice of a lime vinaigrette or a ranch type dressing.  I advise against the lime stuff, it is a little too tangy.  I ordered the chicken Quesadilla and it was pretty good.  This is one of those restaurants were you have to go and order. Don't let anyone tell you what they think because honestly this is a different type of Mexican joint.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location about two weeks ago it was delicious way better than chipotle we thought we took our food home no complaints I believe it was one of their first nights open and the manager was fantastic.  However we just went back tonight and we will not be revisiting this location! We went in for taco Tuesday and after waiting about 25 minutes in line my husband finally spoke up and asked why nobody could finish our tacos or ring us up.  The employees were rude there was not a manager to be seen, except for ironically the manager we ran into last time who promptly ignored us this time and walked into the back.. after my husband said something the customers behind him applauded him, since we had all been waiting well over 25 minutes for our food.  I pass this location every day in Tempe while I attend ASU.  I have never had a problem with that location but this location people seem slow disrespectful and arrogant. The worst part was when they told us they were out of steak tacos and then an employee chopping the meat, (A white guy in his late 30's) said they had steak back as he said that he picked up the steak he was chopping with his bare hands and put it into his mouth and ate it right in front of a whole line of people Who had been waiting 25 minutes and more for their food.  First of all we all used to work in fast food if you are cutting meat with your bare hands you don't pick it up put it in your mouth and lick your fingers while you're cutting it in front of customers!! Second of all I can understand when things get busy and it's hard for employees to keep up! Honestly the first time we were in there our wait was over 20 minutes and we were perfectly OK with that because people were so polite! If you're going to have rude staff with an employee (guy that eats the meat) the customers are waiting on right in front of them you probably need to rethink your hiring choices! We really loved this place when it opened and after the first time we ate there we were so excited to go back until now.. we will not be returning until serious changes happen"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating here. Never had any problems before. Today the issue was the staff. The guy who was building our order was very friendly and nice (promote him) everyone else was not so great. The girl that was by the guy was throwing a huge attitude and looked like she wanted to kill everyone here. Not the kind of worker I would want at my job. In my line of work its all about teamwork or you will fail. Just flat out rude. Food is what you would expect but just the staff with the exception of the one guy was just plain rude."}
{"text":"Had a miscommunication with a pick up order, due to having 2 small babies was unable to come back in and get nachos remade. Spoke with Joey who more than made it right also mentioned that they are under new management so don't let current rating scare you away, still the same great food!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant I love how fresh and fast the food is. My favorite is the toast. More of a Tex-Mex food but very good."}
{"text":"Normally always a great experience, except today. I ordered the fire grilled chicken salad to go. The chicken was all but inedible, there was a smaller than usual portion and it was dry and hard. Very disappointed in the food quality.  I will think twice before visiting this location again."}
{"text":"CHILE ROASTED BEEF BURRITO, ENCHILADA STYLE WITH CHEESE, GUAC, SOUR CREAM AND PICO ON SIDE!! yumm..  i can eat at this place everyday if I wanted to.. but I can't because I will get way too fat way too quick since I can inhale that entire burrito in one sitting.. no lie!!!  food tastes great, the prices are reasonable. call ahead and place order or go online during lunch time, it gets busy!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location for several months but for some reason I feel like it's changed since then. I got a grilled chicken salad. The tortilla tasted like it had been sitting out since lunch time (we went for dinner). The guac was brown. We took our order to go, otherwise I would have asked them to make me something else. The tin the food came in felt cheap(er than before). My boyfriend actually cut through the bottom with his plastic knife. He said his burrito was okay but not what he remembered it to be. We freaking love Cafe Rio and have been to several and love the food. This time was really a let down and we may not be back if it happens again."}
{"text":"It will take a long time for me to forget the poisonous tamales that followed me 425 miles from  Las Vegas to Salt Lake City.  If you are a fan of food from the suburbs of SLC, though, this is the place for you in Vegas. There is even a Nelson's Frozen Custard next door. Oh my heck."}
{"text":"I think I should have thought about what i ordered before I just got stuck in line and had to order quick,but my thought was hmmm seems like a Chipotle type place.  I wasn't a fan at all of what i ordered everything was just blah and bland. I did like the tortilla but they put it in under the salad i ordered.   Just not a big fan, might try it again but go a different route."}
{"text":"Congratulations on providing the WORST customer service experience. This store location is the the weakest link of all chains! The workers need to learn the basics: listening skills, responding properly to customers, avoid talking about personal life in the presence of customers. Perhaps others stores can teach these workers how to speed things up and bring in quality customer service.   This experience proves: In order to have a truly successful business, one must have more than great food. Cafe Rio please step up your game! You are the closest store to my home. I wish the store manager would get it together and reconstruct the business because as of today you are selling yourself short! Cafe Rio has freshly made GOOD food! They make handmade tortillas on a daily bases. They are AWESOME but it's unfortunate this particular store is turning fans away."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, but I wish I could put zero for service.  The people that took our order were so rude, I have a family of 7 and that means a lot of food. They kept brushing me off while I was ordering, I had to repeat the first 3 plates, which were simply 2 tacos, 1 cheese quesadilla and one steak quesadilla kids meal.  When I finished ordering those,I asked about the sides and she said No. You do that at the end, Then my daughter started to order her food and the girl stopped listening to have a full conversation with another employee about her party last night! We stood there for several minutes with a huge line behind us waiting for her to finish her gossip! By the time I got to the end, they had given the 2 quesadillas to the person in front of me.  And the girl asked why I let them do that! I said \" I'm sorry we are still ordering\" she then turned to the guy at the grill and told him to make new ones, and he asked why, then we had to wait for her to give him an explanation.  The girl at the register said my order was making her eyes hurt, and the yelled ouch and grabbed her armpit. I don't know what that was about.  We got our food to the table and there were no knives left with the silverware, so my daughter asked if they had knives and the girl looked under the cabinet, walked halfway to the back and came out and said they were all out. We had to go to another restaurant to get them, because she was too lazy to get some from the back.  When we were about to leave we ordered my oldest daughters burrito to go, and when we went to get her a fork, the knife bin was full! So they weren't out after all! My husband also asked for lids for our food  , and a girl gave him the plastic lids and the other woman asked him why he needed them, he said \"for my family\" She took them out of his hands and got some flat cardboard lids, which we had to smash our food to fit into!  I hate to say this, but we will not be returning. This was the most stressful dinner I have ever taken my family too. Someone needs to train these employees better, because my family of 7 has never had such a horrible dining experience! I understand there are a lot of us, but we are always very polite and patient, there was no excuse for the way we were treated."}
{"text":"Chile Roast Beef tacos were excellent! Daughter loved that you could make a ton of different drinks. Suggest going on Taco Tuesday...taco's 1.00 off"}
{"text":"The best location I have visited. Great food and great cusotmer service."}
{"text":"Been twice. Underwhelmed both times. Major issue is the food does not get hot enough even running it through that little oven twice. Today- the rice was undercooked- crunchy. So, I guess I'm done with it. Too many other good places to eat and I already don't like eating out of a \"dog\" dish"}
{"text":"A coworker had prompted me to try this chain telling me how great it was so I had to give it a shot. i quickly glanced at the menu board and decided to go with barbacoa. i looked over the partition to view the other add ins and noticed that the shredded chicken in another container was swimming in a thick film of red oil and the meat looked \"plastic\" like and not natural.   I should of walked out at that point but for some reason, decided to ignore that and was compelled to move on. I added black beans, rice, guacamole, medium spice sauce, lettuce, and pico de gallo.   The burrito was very big, maybe slightly bigger than Chipotle or Zabas. it went down hill from there. I got home and my burrito was sitting in a lot of liquid. Probably from the pico de gallo not having been drained well. The tortilla was soggy and worse was, the pork was so sweet, it was like biting in a bbq pulled pork burrito. Dont get me wrong, I love pulled pork but i was just not expecting my barbacoa burrito meat to taste like that. It was just an unpleasant surprise and really turned me off to this place. Back to Zabas and Qdoba I go."}
{"text":"Ordered the salads, they were good, but about half way through the meal, we founds bugs crawling in our food. DISGUSTING! told and showed the manager and they refunded us for the meal."}
{"text":"Braiden took me to cafe rio and it was hella chill and hella bomb. I became addicted and now I go almost every day. I recommend the enchiladas!!!"}
{"text":"Generally I'd give Cafe Rio solid two stars, decent enough for what it is.  For the most part I feel that their tacos and burritos are kind of on the bland side, but a friend introduced me to the tuesday special of coconut shrimp, and hot damn, I'm a fan!  The shrimp are big and golden fried and it comes with a fantastic mango chutney, lots of cilantro, and lots of flavor!  The coconut shrimp bump the rating up a full point, but if not for the special, I'd skamper on over to Yayo Taco for a little more flavor."}
{"text":"Hmm this was my third time visiting this location and they seem to be falling off their game a little. On this particular visit they were kind of busy (taco Tuesday) about 4 people ahead of me in line. I ordered one sweet pork taco and one chicken. The toppings bar was pretty messy and could definitely use some attention. After my tacos were prepared and it was time for me to add what I wanted that all went smooth but somehow when I got in the car I had the wrong order. Instead of my two tacos I ended up with three sweet pork tacos with ironically similar topping choices. My tacos were great though I really love the taste. Plus they were fresh and hot which was good.   Fan of the food. I just think this location needs to step it up a little bit and work on cleanliness and accuracy."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. From the 45 min long wait to the unfriendly service. Vegetarians be ware of the rice and beans since the meat slops over causing cross contamination!  My experience was awful. Hardly any beans which they did not strain and they added so much sauce I literally had a soup inside of a tortilla. Since no one wanted to touch my soup, the customers behind me were helped before me. Finally someone added cheese and pico into my burrito. I asked for sour cream and quac and the staff was arguing that it would be extra for both after he had scooped it on. Which he then finally agreed the guacamole comes on it and he could scoop off the sour cream. I was so hungry from the 45 min wait I really didn't care, I just wanted to eat. Then my bf was at checkout and she was asking anything else? And he had to state we were waiting on my burrito. Then the two employees argued over who was going to have to wrap my soupy burrito.  Believe it or not, my soup didn't taste that good either haha"}
{"text":"The tortilla soup at this location is ALWAYS ALWAYS served luke warm, never hot like the other locations. I have given them plenty of opportunities to get it right and they say they keep at at the temp it's supposed to be at. Raise the temp! Soup should served hot."}
{"text":"The service is terrible here. It looks like a new location off the 215 and S Durango. They have no urgency what so ever. You tell just by looking at them that they don't want to be there. They are so painfully slow and they kept getting my order wrong which I had to keep telling them the right order. Just horrible service here."}
{"text":"3 for trying...every time we come here they NEVER have tres leches it should not even be on the menu...they say they run out...i doubt it...maybe lazy to make them or make enough...they charge extra for every little itsy bit of meet or dressing...stingy place...long lines...however its clean"}
{"text":"If I could make a separate review for service it would be 4 stars for how nice and helpful the staff is. But seriously the facility itself needs a makeover or something. It's so dirty! As much as I hate writing this- I was actually feeling nauseous while I was eating. Not sure if it was because of the lack of cleanliness in the dining area or lack of it in the prep area. Could be both because I didn't feel well towards the end of my meal :/ Started to get major cramps. My salad was really good but geez guys, a deep cleaning and then keeping up with the deep clean is super important. The owner needs to know about this. I hope they take reviews about cleanliness seriously."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised this doesn't have a higher overall rating. The food is very good and prepared quickly. It has to be at least as healthy as Chipotle but still offer options of a quesadilla or nachos. the staff is always friendly and helpful, and they seem to get you on your way relatively fast regardless of the size of the line. And with their punch cards you get every 10th meal free"}
{"text":"Maybe I was here on an off night but right now I don't get what all the hype is about with this place.  First of all I cannot stand waiting in a line like a herd of cattle while rattling off my order to someone behind a counter, then shifting down farther to add/delete items, shift down farther to add/delete more items. It's too much shenanigans for me to deal with.  I really just want to order what I want and have them make it happen.  Too much work :-) OK I sound like a whiney brat...but wait there's more!  I had the steak burrito.  Food quality in this is quite poor.  I sure do love some gristle with my \"steak\" burrito. Catch my sarcasm there?  Yeah, gristle isn't good when you are chomping on an already poor excuse of a burrito.  Cleanliness could be a bit better too.  I really am not a fan of having to pre-bus my own table prior to sitting down...you know, wiping off the last persons rice droppings from the table and chair.  Ugh,  I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a better review. The food is great but my most recent experience is enough to keep me from returning to this location. We came in for dinner and ordered our meals. I was a little grossed out seeing one of the employee's healing abrasion uncovered on her arm. Finally got to the register to pay and was helped by a different employee. I noticed this employee was still wearing her gloves. She handled our money and then bid us a good night....then returned to the line with her gloves...tainted with money germs...and proceeded to work with food. No hand washing. No glove change."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good. Years ago, I used to drive 4 hours to their only location in St George to get my fix. Later, I was thrilled to drive to Scottsdale to partake. And now...7 minutes away. My life is complete. Pork Barbacoa Salad with tomatillo dressing is not to be missed, along with their amazing Horchata."}
{"text":"Sucks that they have good food but terrible staff at all locations I've been to. It seizes to amaze me how they screw up your order when you're speaking up front and directly to them. Like they don't even care to listen or pay attention. Worst customer service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but not enough options like patatoes or something if you don't want to add meat. I like that you can get anytning enchalada style.. needed to use the restroom and the bathroom door would not lock so that sucked."}
{"text":"My Family and I Love Cafe Rio. We had visited the location on Stephanie. The Service is Great.   A new Cafe Rio opened in My area at 65 E. Horizon Ridge and it was really close to my house. I have used this location several times. Tonight I have reached my final visit to that location. On 3 separate visits they have ran  out tortillas, Shredded chicken,  beans and tonight salad dressing. We waited in line for at least 1 hour. At other location that I have been to in Henderson. There is no problem with the line. You wait but the line keeps moving. This location the staff is never prepared. I complained tonight 11/14 between 6 and 7 pm.  I asked for A Manager and this unproffesicsl Girl said that's how it was left to her. And then just walked away.  I then said I will change my order that is ridiculous you have no dressing. I just waited for a hour. The girl at the second prep area  just rolls her eyes. After I lost my patience,  cause nobody in there really cares. It's Dinner time on a Friday Night and you are unprepared AGAIN and out of food.  At that moment a burrito gets thrown on the counter.. The Cashier could care less either..I'm Done... I tell my kids let's go. I said I will no longer use this location. I will drive farther just so I don't have to visit this store. I have never had a problem with the 509 N Stephanie Location."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has stepped up there game ... After  several times of bad customer service .. And being out of Chicken, Beef, tortillas and salad dressing..One time I was so furious and just walked out cause nobody seemed to care.   There is new staff and a new manager. And the last couple of times the service has been great. I haven't had any problem with my orders .. Thank You for making it right. Your Food is Great and I want to continue eating at this Great Restaurant."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio can be compared to Chipotle (only better)! They have a lot of choices and their food is more authentic Mexican than most chain Mexican restaurants.  Pros: 1) Friendly service 2) Decent prices (about $10/entree without a drink) 3) Large variety for entrees/meat 4) Large portions 5) Good selection of Mexican drinks that are the same price as a fountain drink (limeade variation of agua fresca, one with stevia sweetener)  6) Ample seating 7) Rewards card (buy 10 entrees, get one free)  Cons: 1) Too cold! It was over 90 degrees outside and I almost wanted to dine outside because it was THAT cold! 2) Not enough trash bins. There was a little one by the fountain drinks and a large one by one of the doors. 3) Meats were marinated on the sweet side (not my preference)  All in all, I would come back!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible. The food is consistently under seasoned and the service is always slow. The Centennial location is much better."}
{"text":"From someone who rarely gives less than 3 stars, here goes.   So I downloaded the CR app when they did away with the stamp cards.  All was well.  I earned a free drink due to one of my FB friends downloading the app as well (oh the power of social media!). Fast forward Saturday night,  My husband and I are going to the UNLV basketball game and decide to go a bit early to stop at CR for a bite to eat beforehand.  Everything was going splendidly until we get to the register.  I let the cashier know that I had a free drink on the CR app and I pull it up on my phone so that she can scan it.  She tries to scan it but nothing happens so I'm asked to brighten my screen as, in her words, their \"scanner doesn't read unless the screen is really bright.\"  No problem!  I adjusted my screen as briiiiiight as it would go.  She scanned it and didn't say another word.  I thought all was well and put my phone away.  Then she tells my total and it didn't seem correct so I asked her if she got the drink promo.  She said, \"Oh no I didn't.  I need to scan it again.\"  At this point I'm starting to get slightly annoyed at having to once again get out my phone, get into it, go to the app and try to pull up the QR scan.  But free is free and I earned that drink!   So I get my phone and pull up the CR app.  However, lo and behold - once I closed the phone down from the previous attempt the QR scan for the free drink disappears.  Gone forever.  So I tell the cashier that it's no longer showing on the app since I closed it and she blankly stares at me.  Deer in the headlights.  I stare back and then ask, \"Are you not able to give me the drink then?\"  She says, \"No, I can't.  I'm sorry.\"  I then go on to tell her that it's not my fault that they have a faulty scanner and she should have let me know that it didn't scan before I put my phone away.  I'm fully expecting her to tell me that she can go ahead and give me the free drink.  Nope - not so much.  Again I get the blank stare.  At this point I realize I'm talking to someone who's inept at best and at worst, completely clueless.  I tell her that I'll just go ahead and buy the drink.  She apologized (points for that cause she wasn't rude at all, just baffled, it seems), I paid for the meal (including around $2.00 for what should have been a free drink) and sat down to eat.   My husband then noticed that there was no cheese on the tortilla of his salad.  Am I dreaming or do they normally melt cheese on the tortilla before they add the rice and beans for the salad?  Minus points for the cheese omission.  Other than that, the food was as good as it ever is.   The drink issue was just a principle thing - a $2 drink is not going to make or break me.  I'm just bitter cause she SAW that I had a QR scan on my phone; she should have honored the free drink.  It's not as if I was trying to get an entire meal for free.   Perhaps management at this CR should put a procedure in place for situations like this.  If they have a scanner that's shoddy, I can't be the first person who's had this issue.  Management?  Are you listening?  Do you even care?!?!?  :) Until then, I'll stick to my old go to Cafe Rio on Warm Springs and Stephanie.  They rock."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a month and never have an issue. If not for my less than stellar experience last night, this Cafe Rio location would deserve a solid 4 stars.   First some background. Let's talk about Cafe Rio's tres leches cake. Cause it's not just good-it's wonderful. It's this moist, flavorful HUGE piece of white cake that's made even more moist and more flavorful by the 3 types of milk that it's so deliciously soaked in. But the best part (not to mention the part that makes it so amazing) is that they top it with fresh whipped cream and strawberry slices. It's heaven in a clear clam shell package. For reals.  Ok so last night. Ugh. I went here specifically for the tres leches. The boyfriend and I had done some shopping and we were both in the mood for something sweet. Cafe Rio tres leches. Boom. So we go and order it to go, pay for it, say thanks, take our bag and drive home. About halfway home, I decide to look in the bag (probably just to remind myself of the yumminess that awaited us) and I'm shocked and disappointed and pissed that there's absolutely NO whipped cream or strawberries on either of the cakes.   'Ok', I think, 'they must have just forgotten it cause we got it to go. I bet they put it in cups and we have to put it on ourselves and they just plain forgot.  Cause they were busy. And this is Cafe Rio. And we've always gotten awesome service here.' (See how I'm so quick to give the benefit of the doubt. Boo. Wrong this time.)   So we decide to just drive back (cause surely they just forgot it, right? And they'll give it to us in containers and we'll be on our way back home and all will be right in our tres leches world). But nooooooooo! When we go in and tell them they've forgotten it, the girl behind the counter says, \"Oh no, I'm sorry, we're out of whipped cream and strawberries.\"  Wait...what?!?! You're out of whipped cream and strawberries? Did I just hear that correctly?! And you didn't think to tell us that when we ordered it? You just ASSUMED that we'd be ok with not getting 2/3 of the freaking ingredients? Oh hells no. Hells to the no!  Not happy, not happy at all. My boyfriend (being the genius that he is) suggested that we drive to the Cafe Rio on Stephanie and ask them for some whipped cream and strawberries. (We're obviously pretty serious about this cake, people!)   So we do. We go to Cafe Rio on Stephanie and Warm Springs and surprise! They are more than happy to give us whipped cream, strawberries and a big huge \"We're so sorry\" on behalf of Cafe Rio Eastern.   Moral of the story? If you're ordering something from Cafe Rio Eastern, make sure they have all the ingredients available! Second moral of the story? Try the tres leches cake at Cafe Rio. Now."}
{"text":"Wish Tracy was here ;) I'm trying something new today,  it's the chicken tosada salad. It's the special today and worth the price. I usually am a creature of habit and get the sweet pork barbacoa salad that's fantastic!  They have kid choices if that suits your needs and there are always kids in this place.  I find it over stimulating at times with kid noise. So definitely not a peaceful meal if that's what you need. Food quality is very good and certainly worth it!"}
{"text":"I came in expecting some good things because I heard some people say the food was good. I went to order the food which is where my first problem started. I told the guy working there I wanted a 2 taco entree with steak tacos, he proceeded to make me a steak burrito and refused to make the tacos after I told him that I didn't want the burrito because it wasn't what I ordered. After paying for the burrito which i didn't order, I left. I got home and I had to take 3 bites of my poorly made burrito before I got to any of the meat, and then all of the contents fell out because the burrito was made so poorly! Needless to say I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Quality Food and Quality customer service. My friends and I love going here, never dissapointed."}
{"text":"Better than chipotle. Yup, you heard me! The meats are amazing.. Fresh made tortillas.. Great drink selection.. Just YES"}
{"text":"I go to cafe rio a few times a week and this was the worst one I have been too.  I ordered a salad and my 10 year old could have made a better one.  I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place always packed. Food is tasty. I would recommend anyone to give it a try. The new spicy green chile pork is my new fave. Barbacola pork is also good if you like a sweeter taste. The tostadas are probably the best deal here."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place, but lately it seems like they can't get a single order right. And today, after standing in line waiting for them to fix another order they messed up, I watched them seem to not even care that they messed up her order or even apologize. Then I finally was next and all I asked for was tres leches with whipped cream and strawberries. I get home, and there are no strawberries. I mean is it really that hard? I used to come here all the time, but this new staff is so careless it makes the food not even worth it."}
{"text":"The Pork Barbacoa Salad is amazing... in fact.. anything that involves their marinated pork is really a highlight of the restaurant.    I will never go to Chipotle again. This is the best \"fast food type\" mexican in town."}
{"text":"Several co-workers recommended Cafe Rio and we had to try it.  We arrived at 6:15pm on a Tuesday and it was a zoo.  3 kids collided with us before we even got in line and the sound level from screaming children was deafening.  We ordered in the swarming, rushed line of patrons where a burrito and drink cost $13 served in a foil tin on a tray that was soaking hot wet straight out of the dishwasher.  Clean tables were nowhere to be found and we bussed one ourselves to make a space to sit.  Food was tasty and spiced well, beans not overcooked but OMG what a horrid dining experience.  Taco Bell is more civilized and a cleaner place than this. Never again, there are plenty of places that are Mexican restaurants charging the same but are not disguised as day care centers.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for some dinner and was on this side of town so I thought I would give this place a try. The dining area is very colorful and spacious.The kitchen is open so you can see the food being prepared when you order it. The highlight was seeing the tortillas being made and cooked right in front of me. So fresh and airy.  My problem was not with the kitchen or the food being prepared but with the employees. They seemed overly sweaty and their shirts were very dirty.. Then there was the cashier whose black shirt was covered in white hair- I am an animal owner so I would bet my money that it was her cats or dogs hair. After seeing that, I had lost my appetite.  I ate my 2 salmon tacos with sides of rice and beans. My food was tasty, fresh, and filling, but it was hard to enjoy."}
{"text":"Best sweet pork! Restaurant is clean, staff is friendly.  Great place for the whole family."}
{"text":"First visit on 12/4/17 to new Cafe Rio was disappointing. Ordered Enchilada plate to go, when l got order home, it was cold and watery. Chips were bland and unsalted. Would not eat in at establishment. Even though it was about 7 P M when l went in to pick up order, long line of customers waiting to place eat in order but no one seated to be served their order. Appears crew running way behind."}
{"text":"Great and fairly cheap tex-mex. What more can you ask for when you want green Chile enchiladas?"}
{"text":"This is a walk-up fast food counter restaurant. Except it's not fast. We stood in line for 15 minutes to get to order. The menu is pretty limited, but what they do is ok - good.  Served in a foil bowl.... it comes hot and fresh. Very limited seating inside and NO lighting for their outside tables. We observed a little field mouse while we ate outside.  Pricing was reasonable. Given our total experience I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I come to this location almost every week, especially for Taco Tuesday.  Love their coconut shrimp tacos, always get them for me and my husband, have to have the mango sauce to go along with it.  The food is always delicious and quickly prepared.  However, tonight, the service here was just horrible.  You get a drink with the combo, so I go to try and get the Passion tea they have out to the side, it's empty.  I try the raspberry tea, they have some so I fill my cup up with ice, only get a little bit before it runs out.  Then I try to fill my cup with lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer.  The machine is out of lemonade.  I go up to the counter to the employee there to let her know the lemonade is out as well as the Passion Tea.  She says she will go fix it.  After waiting for something to happen, I go up again to ask about it and they say she had to fix it in the back.  I ask her again about the teas after noticing all THREE teas they have are all gone, if they can make some more, which she says she can one at a time which will take about 5 minutes each.  I wait until it's been 5 minutes and it's still not done brewing.  At that time, I just wanted to go home and eat my food.  Not good customer service, they weren't busy and couldn't fix it in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I visit this location pretty often and coincidentally I'm always helped by one of these three employees Marry, Ramtin, Rambod, the customer service I get from them is exceptional and even with the high volume of customers they seem to always find a way to smile, be polite, and get me out in a timely manner, I stopped In today for my usual amazing salad and on the way out I asked the cashier if I could leave a tip and she informed me that they weren't allowed to accept tips so my next option of showing my appreciation was this. You guys are awesome and from one customer service employee to another when all else fails just smile  keep up the great work your appreciated!"}
{"text":"Can somebody please explain to me who it was, exactly, that effectively killed proper customer service?  Tonight, my sister and I went to this location to pick up dinner.  I ordered two of the chicken tacos and she just wanted two orders of the flour tortillas to make her own items when we got home.  The guy behind the counter, wrapped up two rolls of two tortillas each and then urged us further down the line to finish our order.  We got to the end, behind one other patron, and the cashier grabbed one of our tortilla wraps and placed it on their tray.  My sister spoke up behind her that she had just given some of our order to the people ahead of us and the cashier snapped that there were others tortillas already rolled up at the previous station.  My sister and I looked through the window/sneeze-guard and noticed two other orders of tortillas that had been there for a while.  Uh, no.  I did not just order fresh food that I intend to pay for, to get somebody else's food that was left for who knows how long.  So, my sister reiterated that the wrap on the tray was ours and the cashier snatched them up and snapped loudly...\"oh my god, they're all tortillas.\"  Again, I ask...what the heck has happened to customer service?!  I snapped at the cashier to calm down and the manager asked if something had just occured to which the cashier told her that nothing had happend.  So, when we got to the front of the line and the same cashier asked if we needed anything else, I asked to speak with the manager.  With an eyeroll, the cashier pointed to the woman next to her.  I told the manager that I didn't appreciate what her cashier had snapped and the cashier chose that moment to interrupt with...\"I wasn't even talking to you!\"  I snapped back and informed her and the manager that if she wanted to be rude and snap about customers, then she should work in a closed environment, rather than the open one where all food preparation can be seen and all sarcastic and nasty comments can be heard.  Once again (as it feels has become my motto lately) I will not be back to this location.  I can handle being given the wrong order, we all make mistakes, but to blatantly treat paying customers in this manner is not only ridiculous but unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this cafe rio there is a line so I don't understand what the issue is here but it's cool it happens. Also usually cafe rio is known for loading your food to the brim. Not here you get a teaspoon of meat, rice and beans. The only good thing at this place is the new location. Everything else is trash."}
{"text":"I came here back in 2013, was not that impressed so I decided to give it another chance with the BOGO coupon they have. They must not pay the staff very much because they all seemed really miserable, it was not even that busy. I wanted a chicken burrito with chicken, beans, rice, guac, cheese and salsa. I had to ask them to reopen the burrito to put in the salsa and guac since the guy wrapped up the burrito before I had a chance to ask him to add it in. The food did not even taste that good. I guess I should stick with Chipotle. I miss San Francisco and the mission style burritos..."}
{"text":"The employees here are rude. I don't know why they hate their lives so much but it seems that they would wrather stab themselves than smile and make your experience there slightly more enjoyable, especially since the food here is a bit pricey. the food here is good and it stockings that I would rather attend a different location and drive farther than go to this one like the Durango location!"}
{"text":"I visited on a Tuesday around 3pm, only a couple people in line. The first worker asked what I would like but seemed aggravated, I told her the burrito with pork, rice and beans. She placed a burrito shell on a plate then walked away. Second woman in line asked me what I would like, I repeated my order, she placed my ingredients in the shell then placed burrito in the oven. Third lady asked what I orded, I repeated and said it's in the oven, she took it from the oven and pushed it down the line to a fourth lady. Fourth lady asked what I'm having, I repeated and she cashed me out. All four women seemed confused and tired of working so hard. Food was very plain and over priced, I was charged almost $2 for a tiny amount of sourcream and guacamole.  Overall  Service was not friendly, I recommend vacations for all Food was plain and over priced Tables and floors were dirty I will not return and will not recommend to try this restaurant"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but some of the staff need some training for sure and there was a bigger guy with long brown hair you seem to have a pretty bad attitude about being at work as if he did not want to be there! You're not happy where you work get a different job"}
{"text":"Omg I can't get enough of this stuff. Soooooo good it's like heaven on a plate. Cafe Rio deserves 5,000,000,000 stars"}
{"text":"I went here because i had a coupon and to avoid Stephanie street. The girls in the line are rude! mean and have no idea how to give a good costumer service! they don't listen or put attention to anything you are trying to say. They act like if they were doing you a favor. I won't comeback to this location! i don't care driving to the Stephanie location, where they always welcome you with a smile and staff is friendly and food is great! :)"}
{"text":"Come here all the time and Never has meat prepared and always out of things. They don't listen to your order and system is sloppy"}
{"text":"I usually don't have a problem with this location but I will most likely never order online again. They messed up my order completely. My salad had the wrong dressing. When my girlfriend picked it up. She told the girl that it wasn't the correct dressing. The worker persisted that it's the only they had, which is bullshit. It's your most popular dressing (cilantro/lime dressing). Gave me shredded chicken when marked grilled chicken.  I ordered my girlfriend a enchilada burrito. Except it wasn't enchilada style. Of course I was charge for it tho!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large to-go order over the phone, and the employees I spoke to seemed very confused and non-attentive. I asked what they recommended, as I had never ordered from there before. The employee couldn't make any suggestions. When I went to pick up the order at the designated time, the employee at the cashier stand said she didn't think anyone had made it yet. Then she came back with one bag of food. I asked if there was more, because the order was large. She then came back with another bag. When we got home, we realized we were missing whole orders that we had paid for. Overall, just very poor customer service, and it seems like no one really knows what's going on."}
{"text":"I usually like Cafe Rio but, I think they just don't have that \"it\" factor anymore. I got a bowl and I basically got lettuce! They only have pico de gallo and the guacamole was most definitely not fresh.   I think Chipotle is much better. They actually listen to you as you request items to be put in your bowls, or whatever you order.   I may try Cafe Rio again, just a different location and see if its any better. I'm willing to give them another chance for redemption."}
{"text":"i was working in the area and it was lunch time. Actually, I was going to Carl's Jr for a quick burger and I noticed this place in the corner of the parking lot as I drove in. so decided to give it a try and give me something to Yelp about.  Kind of a cafeteria style ordering system, you order the food and progress in line where you can watch it prepared and answer any questions they have or ask for anything you want.  It's the typical southwestern type food. They have a fairly good selection, I decided on the Chile Roast Beef (seasoned shredded beef) tacos, black beans and rice. It was good, certainly better than the burger I was going to get.  Would not drive very far to specifically go there, but if I'm in the area I would eat there again (I want to try the burrito, it was huge).  There is certainly no shortage of places to eat at this intersection (Ft Apache & Sahara), but if you're in a southwest mood, give it a try."}
{"text":"Always fresh food and very tasty.  Staff is efficient and very customer service focused.  They have a return customer card that lets you get a free entree after you fill up the card which is a definite bonus!  Like that they have the horchata as well as lime drinks which adds to the foods great taste!    Always in the top 3 of choices when I don't want to make food at home."}
{"text":"I ordered beef tacos and my tacos were soaked in beef juice. I don't think they drain the juice from the meat. The entire taco was soaked! The staff is really unhappy and unfriendly. But I hate complaining, because we are so lucky to be able to go out and buy a hot meal! Even if it's soaked we are a blessed people."}
{"text":"Another Pile on...   When the grand opening happened I was so thrilled.. Just 1.5 miles from us and we love Cafe Rio.  First visit great ! But opening week always is at a place, they blow payroll and want to make a good impression.    2nd visit so so.. The mint drink I love was empty.  My luck   3rd visit we ordered to pick up.  They didn't bother to make it until we arrived at the pick up time .  I am patient it happens... They were out of our favorite - the queso   4th visit - online order again - We arrive and the store is filthy.  Out of ice , drink machines empty and gross.  Order not started again.  Waited 20 min.  Out of Queso again   5th and last visit.   My daughter is a vegetarian and went with us hoping to get something tasty.  They were annoyed at her questions to ensure she was ordering to her preferences.  We waited 40 min .  Drink machines empty and gross AGAIN.  Out of Queso.  I ask why every time we come they are always out.  The annoyed answer was they use it to make salsa.  WTF ?   We'll drive to the Stephanie store From now on.  It's crazy busy there but always good, reasonably fast, always clean and always has QUESO."}
{"text":"Love the chips and queso! Takes me back home to Texas. Nothing out here in Vegas even close to it!!"}
{"text":"My goodness do I love Cafe Rio.  At first glance, this seems like another Chipotle rip off, with the open kitchen and the choose-your-ingredient line.  Under the veneer, though, is an amazingly good-tasting restaurant!  The first thing that impressed me was the tortilla making.  Their tortillas start out as dough balls, and are pulled and flattened by hand before being cooked on a rotating metal plate.  They're thick and delicious, and even on their own ($.95), they're really really good.  Secondly, the meat is very flavorful.  My personal favorite is the pork barbacoa, which is lightly sweet.    I could go on and on about the salads, the chile relleno, tacos, but really, my favorite order is a burrito with pork barbacoa and pinto beans ($6.95), mild sauce and cilantro, enchilada style ($.95, meaning it's got sauce on top, topped with cheese, and lightly baked), with extra pico-de-gallo.  Good enough for two people, under $10.    Another interesting thing is that they have a wide selection of drinks and hot sauces.  It's the only place I know of that has Vanilla Coke *and* Cherry Coke.  They have three different kinds of tea, of which my favorite is the herbal hibiscus, and their mango drink is quite good, too.  They have tabasco, jalapeno tabasco, Tapatio, Cholula, and at least three more different kinds of hot sauces in bottles that I hadn't even heard of.    I have not had any of the desserts, but I have no doubt they're just good and high in quality as the rest of the menu.  Pretty great place to get a cheap meal!  I'm never going to Chipotle, Zaba's, or Qdoba again, Cafe Rio is just that much better."}
{"text":"First Timer!! I heard about their salads so I tried the grilled salmon salad. It was good. Fresh tortilla at the bottom and build your salad from there. The only thing I wished they would do is put protein on top instead of the bottom. Enough for 2 !!! We got there at 8:30 on a Sunday. Unfortunately, they ran out of steak . We ordered tres leche cake and they ran out of whipped cream & strawberries. We got a drink and they ran out of horchata. Sit would have been 4 stars but the lack of supply was disappointing."}
{"text":"I placed an online order and called in a second order on my way to the restaurant. I had no issues placing online order but when I called the second order in, the woman who took my order said it would be ready at 10:15pm. I said, \"Is there any way for it to be ready by 9:50pm? I am on my way now and have to be back to work soon.\" She said, \"yes we will try to have it ready by the time you arrive.\" When I arrived, I spoke to the male behind the register, handed him my card to pay for my order placed by phone. He said, \"oh we're out of that.\" I said, \"okay why was my phone order taken?\" He shrugged his shoulders, and I was needing to get back to work so I asked to speak to the manager. Note that the business should be open for another hour and 15 minutes. The manager said, \"we're making your order now.\" I said, \"perfect thank you!\" When I got my order, I received two orders of chicken tamale specials and no green chili pork salad. I waved the manager down again and asked what was in the bag. She said, \"two chicken tamales.\" I reminded her that I ordered a green chili pork salad as well so she made that for me and I went on my way. When I got back to work, my salad ended up being made chicken, not green chili pork. I am beyond upset with my entire experience. There were at least 6 employees in the kitchen and the manager was doing all of the work. The staff is clearly not fully trained as they were running out of food. As I entered the business a man left yelling about the staff not having enough food. I will no longer be visiting this location as I only would visit here when I am at work anyways."}
{"text":"My tacos had barely any chicken on them or cheese so much lettuce I thought I was eating a salad. No flavor to the chicken guacamole or queso so bland. The staff here were very rude today. The guy taking my order just said \"what do you want?\" When I got to the cashier I had to tell the woman what I ordered when she rang me in. After I paid her and the check was closed the change machine didn't work. She acknowledged that it didn't work and said \"the change didn't come out?\" but nothing else after that, I was owed .75 cents. So then as she was placing my items in the bag I said I also got queso  and guac she said oh. No communication between the man who prepared my food and her the cashier.  So then she rang me up again. So then my change came out of the coin machine this time, I said here's a quarter give me a dollar back since the change machine didn't give me my .75 cents the first time around. She was very annoyed with me. I get that it's \"only\" .75 cents but when you run a business and obviously have to charge people for sodas, sour cream, guac, etc. then I expect my change back. She literally handed me my cup for my drink and didn't say a word. Like what the hell did I do?"}
{"text":"Great food!!  Feels like a less corporate and more upscale Chipotle.  Love it here.  Their salad was huge and plentiful for the price.  I'll be back for sure.  So tasty!!  Lots of shopping nearby as well."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Cafe Rio has great food. I've tried several of the items on their menu and have never been disappointed. My mouth is watering as I write this review thinking about the delicious sweet pork. They have lunch specials that change with the day of the week. I believe Tuesdays are coconut shrimp taco day, and those are by far my favorite lunch special. I always get a side of their creamy tomatillo dressing to dip my tacos in! Try it! The only reason I'm knocking off a star is for their slow lunch service. It takes 20 - 25 minutes sometimes to get thru the lunch line!"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the fresh tortillas!   I had the grilled chicken tacos with pico de gallo & lettuce, side of black beans, no cheese. Lots of flavor going on here!  Hubby had the pork tamale special & it was moist and scrumptious !!  My drink was the limeade with Jamaican flowers. Yum.  Will definitely return! I want to try the shrimp tacos special on Saturdays."}
{"text":"I have no FREAKIN' idea why this place is so d@#n crowded cuz it is not good Mexican food!   I bought me and my daughter each a grilled chicken burrito enchilada style. The sauce is sweet! Sweet sauce on a burrito. Whose idea was that?!?And what is up with the parboiled, crunchy, non-flavored, wanna-be, Spanish rice??? Yuck!!!   And this place is EFFIN' expensive to boot! $23 and change for two burritos and 1 small drink. And it's nasty! Woooowee! I'm mad about this nasty expensive food. The burrito taste like it was vegetarian. What happened to my CHICKEN!!!  I could have gone to a roach coach and gotten better tasting, wayyyy cheaper food. The Horchata didn't even taste right!  Taco Bell is better than this place...  I WON'T EVER BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! My boyfriend and I ate here tonight. We had a BOGO so we figured why not.  The service: The young woman who took our order was friendly. I was a little offput that no one knew what was in the house dressing but it wasn't a huge deal. The young woman accidentally put cheese on my boyfriends salad when he said no cheese but it also wasn't a big deal since she apologized and gave him an extra dressing free of charge. :) The food: The portions put on the salads were very generous! I ordered the pulled pork as my meat - OH MY GOD!!!!! It's so good!! I would HIGHLY recommend getting it. I was saying every few minutes, \"this is so good,\" while eating. Seriously.   Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend eating here. I'll be going here over Chipotle from now on.  Tip: Download their app & use the rewards program. If you sign up with Facebook, you get 20 bonus points! + a BOGO."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio was once a phenomenon that shaped and defined the culinary landscape.  (At least in turn of the millennium Utah) But it has been passed by more nimble, more innovative, and better tasting competition.  It has never really taken off in Phoenix and it has been out hustled and outworked by its knockoff stepson, Costa Vida.  The once hearty portions of meat have been shrunk in favor of rice filler.  The meat has gradually become blander.  The prices are no longer the bargain that once set them apart.  In short, early success turned this once great prodigy into a fresh-mex also-ran."}
{"text":"Slowest. Employees. Ever. I love cafe rio but this location is way too slow. Be prepared to wait a half hour even if there are only 5 customers in line."}
{"text":"My favorite Rios! I'm sure you can't get a better service at Rio anywhere in town.  Good size portions, quality products and great service. Love it here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cafe Rio. You really can't go wrong with any item on the menu. I usually get the chicken enchiladas or the chicken tacos with the homemade corn tortillas. Their prices are reasonable, they give you a lot of food, and they are fast. I try to make it here every time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"So many great things for a reasonable price.  Try the barbacoa pork burrito or the coconut shrimp tacos-- excellent.  You can also call in an order for take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"For those of you who aren't familiar with Cafe Rio: It's similar to Chipotle but waaaaaay better!  Every time I visit Las Vegas, my sis-in-law usually has leftover cater-sized portions of the Pork Barbacoa Salad with the house dressing. During my last visit, we had lunch here and this time I got to try it with their tortillas, which is seriously like crack. Normally I don't like to order salads at fast food places but this is the exception.    The portions are pretty big but I can eat this salad in one sitting."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is amazing, is part of our regular lunch @.my work, we order at least 4 times a week, they are very good @ getting our orders right, too. What I love the most is the pulled pork salad with their house dressing and the chips con queso!!!!"}
{"text":"OK I've given this place a couple shots, and I think I'm officially fed up. I ordered my food over the Internet and they told me it would be 30 minutes I got there over 45 minutes to an hour later and I couldn't believe that I was still waiting and there was no one in the restaurant. The guy seemed extremely slow when I kept telling him I had already paid/was very frustrating. I also don't recommend getting the salmon because they don't take the whole grilled salmon they chop it up and then they put it inside and mix in the salad which I think is very in appropriate. Some people like their salmon right on top which is what I prefer. The lettuce is not fresh mixed greens isn't like a very finely chopped iceberg. If you want quick whatever Mexican food sure then go for it. But I don't think I'll be coming back there's a lot better options to go to"}
{"text":"This place is great, the food taste fresh, the ingredients are all good quality, portions are huge, everything is flavorful, and the tortillas are delicious.    I usually get the shredded pork burrito enchilada style and it's awesome.  The pork is in a sauce that reminds me of mexican BBQ sauce and the burrito is huge and the 3 enchilada sauce choices are all good.  Shredded chicken with the green sauce is a good combo too.  Try the chips with cheese, you get a big ol' cup of cheese sauce that has some great chile flavor but isn't to spicy and the chips are good.  The tostada salad is also tasty.    I am from northern california and on every corner there are mom and pop burrito places and SOME of those places make a burrito that is magical, I have been missing that for years in Vegas.  While this is not the best burrito ever it is hands down the best burrito I have had in vegas so it gets 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Third time I have been in.  Seems to be run by high school kids in the evening.  Dirty food prep line.  One of the girls looked so unfriendly and almost falling asleep as she slowly filled our orders.  Both times being in here is super slow and chaotic and not very easy for all the staff in the back.  I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised at the negative reviews...I frequent this particular establishment about twice a month (my wife would go more if I let her, lol) and we've never had bad service or food..I tried the Cafe Rio on Eastern and actually thought it lacked something?  Plus, the lemonades are awesome!"}
{"text":"I love their tortilla! I usually grt sweet barbacoa with pico de gallo, lettuce and gucamole. I also mix the creamy tomatillo and cilantro vinagrette and pour over my rice. Yum!!! Their horchata on the other hand is not so good..."}
{"text":"I think the food at Cafe Rio has potential, but the service at this location is bad...most of the time. The wait is excessively long and they seem to always be out of queso dip. Most of the crew looks to be more into fun than work. I have never seen a manager here, or at least seen anyone that resembles a manager here. The hardest working people are the ladies making the tortillas. I am not happy with the amount of meat that they give. They seem to do the same thing that Chipotle does, where they scoop or grab a bunch of meat and then scoop or grab some of it right off of your burrito. Somethimes they forget to do that grab the meat off your burrito thing and that makes me happy. Otherwise it is pretty much a not good experience from the beginning ( the excessively long line) to the end (trying to find a clean table and being disappointed in your rice overload burrito).  This location needs some customer service training.   Enjoy, the location on Eastern."}
{"text":"Just a tip, if you drop a customers food on you don't proceed to continue making the item & get annoyed when i tell you i saw my food on your clothing make me a new one. really?! won't be back to this location. love cafe rio in general though!"}
{"text":"i really like this location. close to my house, quick service. the food is always hot and well prepared. i think my only complaint is the sauces flavor consistency varies based on who's working."}
{"text":"The staff could smile but the food from this place is always good we will see we got it Togo      Forgot my tortilla . Easy fixes to there team creating a happy environment and attention to detail when a customer is ordering forgot our tortilla s ! Night rush had the line a little frazzled !"}
{"text":"Its was ok. The staff were not friendly and you could tell they were unhappy and didnt care. The sweet beef tacos were good but the beans were burned and old. On the past this place was really good but it seems to be going down hill"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Seating area always clean. Plenty of seating inside & out. Only complaint is that they don't have corn tortillas even on a semi regular basis."}
{"text":"Visited on 6/11/16 Went with a party of three during the afternoon.  Atmosphere: Lively and colorful Despite there being a long line upon arriving, the music, lighting, and decor contributed to the sensory experience of the visit. The colors and lights invoked a modern and natural feel, and the colorful, expanded menu adjacent to the lines introduced a visually-engaging element to the waiting experience.  Service: Quick! Despite there being a line, the service was quick! The waiting time was reasonable and the servers put together our food quickly.  Food: Expected quality The food is a fair value for what is paid. I ordered a barbacoa burrito, and for the price I paid for the meal, the burrito and greens that accompanied them were fresh, flavorful, presented well. One drink, however, is pretty pricey, but with the assortment of drinks available to consume, it's great if you are looking for something unique to quench your thirst.  Summary: Worth it! Despite the long line, the somewhat-high prices, Cafe Rio offers freshness, quality service, a welcoming atmosphere, and a modern yet natural dining experience. Visit any Cafe Rio when you get a chance."}
{"text":"7/26/15 went back after a long time away. Has become even worse. If you want to appreciate every other cafe rio, come  to this one. It's awful. Always out of what you want.  Workers who all look overworked and under appreciated. No manager in sight. It's not worth the 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Great mexican food with freshly cooked tortillas and homemade guacomole. Large portions as well. Could be a Chipotle-killer!"}
{"text":"Fresh and Delicious.  The Spicy Green chili Pork was superb.  There was a super long line but they had plenty of staff to handle the crowds.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Great a new Mexican place to try! Don't waste your money.  Ordered a spicy green Chile pork burrito. There was nothing spicy, green, or Chile about it. The sauce was actually brown and had the taste of sugary brown gravy. As for the actual burrito they use a fresh tortilla that is about 14 inches round and is stuffed with everything but green chile. They used literally 3 table spoons of pork in a burrito that was 7 inches long 3 inches wide  and 2 inches tall.  No shortage of beans and rice."}
{"text":"A great tasting tortillas.  If you enjoy Chipotle then you will Love Café Rio. Somewhat same concept, however Cafe Rio has much better food. The tortilla's are hand made and absolutely delicious. So is there fresh homemade guacamole. You have to try Cafe Rio's sweet barbocoa pork, it is amazingly tender and succulent.   Cafe Rio is an excellent Mexican Grille, that's quick, however Cafe Rio doesn't skimp on the big bold flavor. I prefer to get the taco salad with the pork barbacoa or green chili beef.  Make sure you try the house cilantro lime ranch dressing, a wonderful compliments for your salad.  Homemade tortillas, daily specials and fun atmosphere add up to a great place to eat. Reasonable pricing and great service.  Would recommend to anyone."}

{"text":"Employees at this location weren't very friendly and the food had been siting out for too long. tortillas and meat were hard and dry..."}
{"text":"This location is trash literally... Food is terrible and looks like it's been sitting there all day.... do not eat here!!! They also charge 2 bucks for a little ramekin of guac smh."}
{"text":"The location is very easy to spot and there is ample parking. There is seating on the outside with umbrellas. The out door seating seemed a little tight, but it's nice to have the option.  Upon entering the decor this very bright and welcoming.  The tables were spaced nicely and it did not feel cramped despite being very busy.The line was long but organized and moved pretty quickly. Customer service was good. Everyone was very friendly, and no was annoyed, even though I kept adding to my order.   I like that the food is made upon order. Rverything smrlled amazing, which was why I kept adding things to my order ! The food was pretty good. I felt like everything was really fresh.  I had tacos with Pulled Chicken , Lime and  Cilantro Rice ,Pico de Gallo and some Guacamole . I enjoyed my meal.  I will definitely come back to try other items."}
{"text":"I normally love the food, but the carne asada burrito with the enchilada sauce was just ok. No flavor like some of their other meats. Maybe a bad batch. Staff was very friendly and welcoming ."}
{"text":"Love this place, Always a pleasure going in. I love how everything is freshly made to order as you're in line. The queso and chips might be straight from heaven.  I took two of my buddies to cafe rio for their first trip (they're from back home) and they destroyed a couple burritos and raved about the flavor.  Enchilada style is the way to go"}
{"text":"Really like this cafe rio. Went for lunch on a thursday a little after noon. Me and a buddy just beat the noon rush by about 5 minutes. I got the barbacoa pork nachos and the sweetness of the pork is perfect with the hotness of the hot sauce. It's a big meal so bring your appetite. This location is consistent with the other two locations I frequent, the one on Blue Diamond and Decatur, and the one on Eastern just north of Silv Ranch. Everything has been great at all of the locations, this one was just convenient to where I happened to be.   It's a solid price for the amount of food and the location and service was spot on. 4 solid stars. Need to try their steak burrito, enchilada style and make sure it compares to the other locations."}
{"text":"I was nearly a Chipotle addict, but I can honestly say I haven't eaten there since Cafe Rio opened--it's just too good.  The salads are by far the best thing on the menu, and the barbacoa is so sweet and juicy that it makes all the healthy stuff seem super tasty. I decided to get adventurous once and order their tres leches cake and wasn't impressed, but the food off the line has never disappointed.  Be careful going during peak lunch hours, this place fills up with students and staff from the university and the line can get pretty long."}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Rio tonight with the family for Taco Tuesday. It was busy, but not THAT many people. I don't know if they were short staffed or what, but they needed to speed up the process. Took forever. Also the trash cans were overflowing. I know it's a busy day since it's Taco Tuesday, but it happens every week. Have more staff that night.   The food was great, but we were easily waiting 20 minutes just to order. Loved the sweet pork. Can't beat a free kids quesadilla too!  Made a trip the the ladies room while I was there and noticed the trash can blocks the diaper changing station. Might want to relocate that to another space so someone could actually use the changing station."}
{"text":"The service was great this time around probably because he was the manager! The pico has huge tomatoes maybe they should be cut smalled besides that great"}
{"text":"The food was good. It is across the street from Wells Fargo Arena and ASU. The parking is tight because of BWW, the Improv and other stores in the same center. Very slow service; we waited in line, without anyone in front of us for 5 minutes before an employee looked at us. We will update this review next time we come. Food: 4 stars Service: 2 stars Cleanliness: 4 stars"}
{"text":"I really liked cafe rio the first few times I had it but this last time was terrible I'm not coming back. First off the people in the kitchen have no people skills, like I'm doing great thanks for not asking. Secondly maybe you should stir the food before you serve it, you know so it's hot? And lastly flour tortillas don't belong on tacos! Not to mention how the hell does a Mexican joint not have a salsa bar? 10 bucks for that when chipotles next door? Yeah right."}
{"text":"I love cafe Rio. Everyone I come they have phenomenal food. The service is always amazing."}
{"text":"Love the chicken salad and ice tea. They are very friendly and food is very fresh."}
{"text":"This staff does not know what they're doing. Tons of people working yet 1 or 2 people only making food. Be prepared to wait 20 min if it's busy, if it's not busy there's still a wait."}
{"text":"This is my third time here at this location and still I don't like the service here. I know they are busy, but they don't have to throw the food at you. Literally, almost went off the counter. I asked to a frequent stamp card which I use at other locations. They ran out so no stamp card for three meals. I think sometimes this place is overrated! I'm done."}
{"text":"Stay away from this Café Rio, go to the one on Centennial. This one is right near our house and would be very convenient but we would rather drive three extra miles and actually have good service. First I can't tell you how many Times we have called to place a go order, been put on hold, and no one ever comes back to the phone and we have to call back again. Second, they never have desserts, they are always out but the other Cafe Rio's always have desserts, so what's the story there? Anyway, seeing the numerous numerous complaints about the store, and the fact that we've gotten bad service from the store for years, apparently nothing has changed and the café Rio franchise does not care about the store. Sad but luckily there is one close enough that it's not a super big inconvenience we will just never go here ever again."}
{"text":"I will never be returning to this cafe rio, and I will be calling corporate about the lack of customer service at this location. The staff is just plain rude, lazy, and does not care what so ever. I don't understand how it is possible to have so many employees who are so incompetent in one place. I honestly blame the manager for allowing this. From what I have read in the yelp reviews though apparently her staff is following by example. This location used to be fast and full of happy employees. Man has it taken a turn for the worse. They have employees that work the line that don't even know what comes on the damn salad! You work there, and it's all sitting in front of your face! Any how, I really hope that entire staff gets let go and they actually clean up their act. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Honestly the only reason we come to this café Rio is because it happens to be on this side of town... the service is poor...whenever I make my order on the telephone they are rude or leave me on hold for 5 to 10 minutes I end up hanging up and calling them back and then they will answer the phone! not to mention they always and I mean ALWAYS get my order wrong even though I repeat myself 2 to 3 times! Very frustrating. The restaurant is self is okay the usual long lines but besides that the food is pretty good. The only reason they get two stars is because the food is good. :\"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and was really looking forward to trying Cafe Rio so when we had an opportunity to go there I jumped on it.  The decor is great and the store was very clean.  Unfortunately that is all the good there is to report.  The line was Disneyland long with stanchions and everything , there was no menu to look at while ordering food, and then I was given $17 in change...all in singles.  Overall the food was expensive and mediocre at best, with limited options.  The beans were too salty.  I don't plan on going back..."}
{"text":"Always love grabbing something from Cafe Rio especially on tostada Wednesday! This is the first time I ordered a salad in a long time and lived it just like I did the first time I had the salad. This time I had the spicy pork and my wife had the sweet pork.   I was disappointed to find out the tortilla was no longer run through the salamander. All in all though, still very delicious and we will be back."}
{"text":"Good food (sometimes) Some ingredients gone (always) Ordered online has promises time but never get it on time ?!?"}
{"text":"Great food! Cant rush quality food as others are complaining about how slow it can be. Its not a fast food joint.. Go to McDonalds if you want a drive-thru experience!   Thanks Cafe Rio for the awesome food & service you provide!"}
{"text":"Always Awesome , tasty and reasonable.  Cheese Queso is always fantastic and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and fell in love! Coming from the East Coast, we're use to Chipotle, which we no longer need. The food is consistently delicious, even though the portions of meat can vary from day to day (depending on the servers), so overall, I'd give it a 4.5. The inside is always freezing, so we eat outside or take it home - either way, a cheap awesome and fresh meal. Also love the frequent diner card - 10 meals leads to a free one - and they always take the most expensive one off the bill."}
{"text":"The food was real good, however, it was a little costly. Wife was not happy at the fact that the ice tea was empty.    The food was great! The service was good and the overall wait time was not to bad."}
{"text":"The food is good it's just the cleanliness is not where it should be. Not to say it's just filthy but a lot of wasted food on the floors and the food line is pretty messy as well. Glad they finally opened one out here but it just needs to be a little cleaner. Back to the food- same as all rio's I've been too which is bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food but why does it take soo freakin long to get through that line? they have like 20 employees back behind the counter but only 2 people taking the orders and one lady looks like she belongs working at the dmv. If it was the only time I would get over it but it has been this  whole last year. When they first opened they had several people taking orders and they were happy and extremely fast. Im ready for those days to come back. ....please TACO GODS fix this problem.   and stock some Chalula hot sauce please! the last few times you have been out and I am going to have to start bringing my own."}
{"text":"Good Tex-Mex... and it was nice that they offered a 50% discount for policemen."}
{"text":"Me, my mom & my little brother decided to try this place out since we wanted something new. First the customer service was horrible, it's like everyone hates their job & didn't want to be there. Second it wasn't busy and they had the orders mixed up and almost had a guy cut in front of us. Once we get to the register to pay we checked the chicken ( we had nachos w. shredded chicken etc) and the meat was cold  like what the! So we asked for them to heat it up and the girl had such an attitude.   We're never coming here again. Chronic tacos have better food & service"}
{"text":"Love this place and it pains me to give them 3 stars but I have ordered take-out on numerous occasions and they have NOT ONCE got my order correct!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice and both times there was confusion with our orders..not a big deal. I ordered the one Taco Meal with grilled chicken. You get one taco, rice & choice of beans (black or pinto) It was o.k. nothing to write home to grandma about..but it was over $9.00 with regular drink. I don't like the layout ..it's like a free for all at the drink station and there are so many employees there it's like their all in there own way..I will say the employees are very nice and apologized for my wait..which was nice. Also, they typically come around and remove your tray and garbage when done eating so you don't have to. I like the pinto beans (not the rice) and both times I went my food wasn't very hot but this was probably due to waiting for large (and I mean LARGE families to get all their drinks) I notice that a lot of people who eat there are quite heavy..The salsa is only pico de gallo..which I hate. I like smooth red or green hot salsa, no chunky stuff. When you order Nacho's or Chips & Salsa they sing this horrible 'Nacho Man\" song that I guess Management thinks is cute but it's totally annoying and seems to be a distraction to a already distracted staff. I give the staff 5 stars but the whole concept and food 2 stars"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it serves its purpose.  Satisfying food, quick service, friendly enough staff and seemed clean to me.  When I'm in need of a quick Mexican food fix I'd hit this place again."}
{"text":"Terrible, didn't even make the meals correctly and half assed it, employees don't help when I was standing there with a tray not having any place to put it, employees are Terrible I wish I went to the one on Stephanie"}
{"text":"Bad customer service at this location. There were nearly 10 employees, 3 customers and the 2 girls at the register were talking and not making eye contact or helping me. I stood there for 2 minutes and they didn't acknowledge me. Disappointing, guess I'll go to Chipotle next time."}
{"text":"This is one of, if not the worst Cafe Rio in town. I used to live over by the Eastern/Richmar location and loved the food and customer service. I moved to Deep Henderson (Paradise Hills) area about a year ago and was disappointed with the food choices nearby. Then one day I noticed this location was being built.... My wife and I rejoiced. We came to this location the day it opened and have been disappointed with it ever since.  The wait time when in line is ridiculous, it's as if sloth's are making ur food.... And by the time u reach the location to order (at around 6pm;prime dinner time) we have been told several times they are either out of chicken, steak, lettuce, pico, guac, etc.... This is a popular Mexican food establishment/chain. How does this happen?!?!?! And it's sad because there really isn't a lot to chose from over here that we can just avoid this Cafe Rio location all together.  I've about 4 months ago, I was standing in line when I noticed some rather juvenile behavior. Two of the punk kids in the back of the kitchen were \"smoking and joking\" around with each other using profanity like they were in the locker  room at high school. What a joke!  Every now and then we place the occasional \"To-Go order\" in an effort to just grab some quick Mexican food by the house. They can't even get this right!!!! The food either isn't ready after an hour, or my meal is messed up entirely. I'm not the complaining type, but I boiled over the last time I was there and expressed my frustration in as nice a way as I possibly could. I asked to talk with the manager, and the check out clerk told me there wasn't one. Waaaahhhh?!?!  I've been eating Cafe Rio since it came to town many years ago and absolutely love the food when it's made appropriately by professionals. This location is a disgrace to the franchise."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 20+ times over the past few years.  Reliable good food and that isn't always an easy thing to get served in Arizona.  Latest favorite is the green chile pork burrito done enchilada style.  Last three I've ordered I was very happy with.  Glad to see the recent dining table renovation as it was needed!  (I will admit I like the welded fabrication of the tables as whomever built it did them correctly and it inspired me to build a similar set for my outdoor dining table!)"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  If I were to compare it to Chipotle I would say Cafe Rio wins.  I used to love Chipotle but its not the same these days.  When I walked into Cafe Rio I immediately liked the fact that it had a Mexican themed atmosphere that Chipotle lacks. They send your food through a toaster which adds a nice finish to their product.  The staff was friendly and my burrito was awesome."}
{"text":"Really poor customer service.... I went for 2 days in a row and both days I was dissapointed. Day 1 They gave me flour tortillas instead of corn and when I asked to change them they gave me cold corn tortillas for my tacos, so the food was nasty, but I ate because I was hungry and didn't have time for arguments. Day 2 Different worker (girl) didn't offer rice or beans and when I asked about it she just said with an ugly attitude black or pinto and tossed the plate into the counter"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food great quality and more on the healthy side compared to a lot of other other places"}
{"text":"Well , I have a true love to Café rio food . Any time I think about going out and getting some food all my friends would know that Café rio would be number 1 place for me to go .  This location is really disappointing. I go there pretty often and each time I see new people working there . Last night the guy who was giving me rice , beans and meat for my salad seemed to be not even knowing what he was doing . His metal trays were empty and when I saw it , I asked myself \"is he gonna refill it or serve the air ?\" Well, he didn't refill it.   He literally gave me NOTHING . Same thing he was doing to other people . The guy behind me looked at it and decided to get double meat cause double would be barely an amount of regular .  The same thing he did to rice and beans . I just wonder does this food goes from employers'  paychecks ?  I'm giving 2 stars because another employee ( the guy who was serving the rest my salad ) gave me a good amount of salad . So I basically was eating greenies with tortilla yesterday .  Thank you Café rio for putting me on a diet ."}
{"text":"Ok I do admit they are not traditional Mexican food.  That being said they are a very good fast food place.  I have eaten here numerous times and I have never been disappointed.  They use fresh ingredients which is evident in the tastes of their food.      I have had their salad, burritos, quesadilla, tortilla soup and enchiladas.  They are all very good and their cost is quite reasonable.    Their competition would be Chipotle and Moe's.  I have been to all 3 and Cafe Rio is much better due to better ingredients and freshly made tortillas.      It doesn't matter the time of day there is always a line but it moves fast.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  Great for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio. They offer so many choices--different meats, sauces, fillings. You can get exactly what you want. I like their shredded chicken enchilada with the green sauce, which is more tangy than spicy. Their quesadillas are cheesy   and large enough to share. They have a good selection of beverages--sodas and teas."}
{"text":"I love this place, but it's Christmas Eve, your sign in the window says you're open til 8, but when I knock and ask, the girl literally just peels off the window sign and says \"we're closed\" WTF?! It's 6:44, not exactly just before closing, and judging from the way the chairs are on top of the tables you closed WAY before your posted time. Badly Cafe Rio, badly done."}
{"text":"I ordered online for a salad with extra meet and extra dressing on the side. Pretty sure I didn't get the extra meet I paid for and there was zero dressing. Still tasted ok but still sucks."}
{"text":"I've visited this location multiple times and I've never had a complaint. I love the food, I love the horchata, and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is pretty good food. This particular Rio is awesome. You have to get here early or you will be waiting in line and may be forced to sit outside or get your food to go. If you're in the mood for Mexican style cuisine but want less lard and grease then Rio is the place to go. The enchilada sauce and balboa is really tasty. I would actually give this particular location 3.5 stars and not the full four.  The con for this location;  parking is a nightmare during lunch and dinner hours. Cafe Rio is definitely overpriced. The burritos are huge and worth every penny. The tacos and enchiladas are way overpriced for the amount of portions you get.    My recommendation is the chicken nachos, enchilada style (red or green sauce) with lime salsa and fresca.. enough to feed two that's for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and service has never been an issue.  The kids enjoy it and their one of kind drinks are refreshing especially during the summer!"}
{"text":": ) Staff was very friendly and upbeat : ) Good options for sugar free drinks include Diet Dr Pepper, Diet Coke, Unsweetened Iced tea, and Lemonade sweetened with Splenda : ) Variety of bottled hot sauces**  : ( A tad overpriced : ( Not friendly options for low carb  I so wanted to like this place, but I totally agree with the current 3 star rating. I have some restrictions on my diet but I thought I could probably get a meat bowl like I do at Chipotle. Well, there don't seem to have such options and I ended up getting a sad meat plate with the equivalent of the meat for 3 tacos (no tortilla). Shredded beef because carne asada was not included in the Taco Tuesday special (which seems to be very popular, long lines during our meal, mainly to go, I think). So I was told because of the Taco Tuesday special it was going to be $6 plus tax for 3 very small portions of meat, of what otherwise would have been $9 plus tax for the same 3 small portions of meat (3 meat sides). I was going to add sour cream ($1) and guacamole ($2), but when I saw the portions I decided to not go for it. I just went home and had an additional 4 oz of steak : )  I thought it was over priced for what it was, and I just don't understand how a fast food place with this kind of setting can't be a little bit more friendly for dietary restrictions. Oh well."}
{"text":"Stopped by today and had the double enchilada plate and let me tell you, it looked way better than it actually was. I ordered the \"hot\" sauce on stop, that sauce should be re-labeled \"mild\". It had no kind of spiciness to it. I ordered it to go and by the time I got home (I live 2 minutes away) my food was cold. I give it 3 stars because the first time I went I had the sweet pork barbacoa tacos and they were pretty good, unlike today's meal. I wish I would have stopped by Panda Express instead."}
{"text":"Gosh 2 years later thought something would change but at the same place. Put order in on line. Showed up 40 minutes later and nothing done. First time I came to this location in Henderson food took forever. Today I thought I would do smart thing and order on line. Placed on line order, gave me time for pick up, showed up and they hadn't even printed out any of the on line orders for last hour. Long story short had to sit and wait while they tried to find orders and then make the food from back log. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food was great had the special of the day for Friday salmon tacos & my husband had the enchiladas!! Employees could work on their customer service and also tidiness but I understand it's a new location and they are probably still getting the hang of things. I'd definitely still go back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here because we had a stellar deal! We both downloaded the app and had a promo code which added up to $10. Since we both had $10 promo code, we decided to try it out.  Cafe Rio is like a Chipotle kinda restaurant. Pick what you want, pick your meat, rice, beans, etc.  I ordered a burrito with Chile Roast Beef with rice, cheese, lettuce, pico, sour cream and hot sauce. My meal came out to 9cents!   My husband ordered the fire grilled chicken quesadilla with lettuce, pico, sour cream and the hottest hot sauce. His meal came out to 85cents!   Since we didn't pay too much out of pocket, we ordered a small drink cup for $2 and some change.   Let's start with the drink, we first filled or cup with the raspberry ice tea, but it didn't taste like it at all so we dumped it out and my husband filled it with horchata. I must say they had one of the best horchata I've ever tasted!   Chile Roast Beef Burrito - they put waaaaaay too much rice in it and hardly any beef. It lacked a lot of flavor.They put hot sauce in it, but I really couldn't taste any heat so I had to add Tabasco sauce on it.   Fire-Grilled Chicken Quesadilla - this was pretty good, better than the burrito I must say. Pretty simple, just chicken and cheese and lettuce and pico on the side. My husband asked for the hottest hot sauce and it wasn't even hot. It had no spice to it whatsoever.   Maybe well come back and try something else, but that won't be until we get a deal like this again!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the employees sucks!!!!!!! Rude & not friendly at all. I get it, they are busy, but for its time customer like me, I ask questions about the menu and they answer me rudely!!!!!! No Bueno!!!!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Very nice staff and delicious FRESH food! Massive proportions and soft yummy tortillas."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but EVERY time there is an issue.   Today it was fish taco day and despite clearly stating on the menu they come with cabbage, they don't have any cabbage. I asked why is it on the menu especially since cabbage is standard on fish tacos...she says oh I had no clue. GIRL! Really?  Honestly the only thing keeping me coming here are the great coupons through the rewards program but the service really sucks...each and every time I come."}
{"text":"Place is awesome staff is great. Vanessa was great made our food fast and  is super friendly."}
{"text":"I never have a good experience at this location! Absolute worst service. They don't care nor do they listen to what you want on your food! The lady behind me caused a scene as to how her food was being made which then caused me to be on the back burner and to receive lackluster service. I didn't get offered the rice and beans that comes with the meal I am paying for, until well after I had already been ignored on my order, waiting to pay after they then took a walk up in front of me. I had to ask for cheese twice & they still say \"No cheese!\". Go to a different location. This one is always a mess and not worth the bad service! Paid $11 for two small tacos with nothing on them  and crappy service!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place only has 2.5 stars. Come on taco Tuesday! Their tortillas are amazing and I just tried the Tres leches and it was way good!"}
{"text":"My 4sar review is probably a bit slanted. The truth is, I've been here several times, today for lunch in fact, and I've only eaten their Thursday special: Barbacoa pork tamales. these tamales have changed my opinion of tamales. The pork filling is slightly sweet and delicious while the masa is moist and tasty. The hot sauce isn't very hot, but it has good flavor. I like the variety of drinks available as well as the torino's syrup selection so u can make insane drinks. I prefer cafe rio over chipotle. Thinking of the pork tamales is making my mouth water."}
{"text":"Completely useless.  This place has yet to ever get an order right.  I always order several sides of tortillas and they have screwed me over every single time whether I order online or in person.  When you ask for a side of tortillas they act confused as if no one ever orders them... It is on the effing menu ffs.  I am done with this place for good this time."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The shredded beef was perfect and the tortillas were really authentic. I am not sure how the restaurant is because we had catering. The catering process and packaging were worry free."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service us excellent, people are friendly, food is excellent and affordable.  My favorite us the steak burrito with medium green sauce enchiladas style. Their salads are awesome. Also really enjoy their queso and chips."}
{"text":"mmmm my mouth is drooling as i think about their salads.  Yummo.  Can't wait to come back.  Love the fact their employees do not get upset as I ask tons of questions trying to figure out what to eat.  Their veggies are fresh and their portions are huge. I found my new salad spot."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've been here 3 times. I'm not from this state of its not that often I can eat here. The food is delicious and the portions are large. The staff is really friendly and helpful. I can eat here everyday. :)"}
{"text":"I've already written a glowing review about Cafe Rio's coconut shrimp tacos from another location. I happily made my way in for some tacos yesterday at this particular location. As always, the tacos are a winner!  The overall experience is key to a happy customer. Although the food was on point, their women's bathroom smells like sewage. Sewage may be an understatement. How about sewage with a side of trash and a dash of pig's pen with a sprinkle of BO. It was enough to make me a queasy before devouring my coconut shrimp tacos.   I hope they get this issue fixed in a hot minute."}
{"text":"So there's one thing on the menu here that I'm a huge fan of. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have rated Cafe Rio a 4.   Go to Cafe Rio on a Tuesday. Order their Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Eat the Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Leave Happy.   These tacos are seriously heaven on earth. You can order 1 or 2 tacos with a side of rice and beans. A fountain drink comes with the tacos since it's the daily special. Each taco is stuffed with 2 or 3 pieces of coconut breaded shrimp, lettuce, some cilantro and comes with a side of warm mango chunky salsa. It's really unfortunate that these tacos are only available on Tuesdays. Or else I'd be there every single day as their star customer!   Their rice and beans are alright, nothing to gush over. Personally, I think the rice and beans at Chipotle are better. They have homemade tortillas here. Those are alright, too. If you get their burrito, spend a dollar more to get it \"enchilada style\". They douse their hot sauce over the burrito and sprinkle cheese on top.   Cafe Rio recently started to put their specialty drinks out by the fountain drinks. Their strawberry lemonade, mint limeade and horchata are all available to refill for free! I personally like to mix the strawberry lemonade and the mint limeade together. It's really refreshing - a must-have for the Vegas summers.   Don't forget to get a stamp card! Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!"}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Rio yesterday for the first time. Was a little skeptical because the menu for me was a little overwhelming didn't understand how things worked, considering I'm so used to Chipotle. And FYI if your expecting this place to be similar to chipotle you'll be surprised lol.   So I ordered the Quesadilla and they were making the tortillas right in front of me!! 1-0 cafe rio vs chipotle. Clearly cafe rio is winning right now. So back to the tortilla making, this lady was rolling the fresh tortillas out then putting them on the huge spinning griddle. Where they cooked for a little bit then we're taken off and placed on a flat top! All were made per order!   They were extremely friendly Sherman asked if we were new and course we said yes so guess what.... They started SINGING it was just an awesome experience!  We got to the condiment bar and there was nothing but different flavor syrups to spice up your beverage. Super cool.  Now on to the food... It was delicious you can totally taste the difference of a fresh made tortilla and prepackaged one..so good, rice was a smidge salty but guacamole was spicy and good..  So I leave you with this.. 2-0 Cafe rio, Chipotle who?!"}
{"text":"If I could give Cáfe Rio a zero star rating I would.  The last three times I have been to Cafe Rio my order has been completely wrong not my co-works but mine every time. I was not going to ever go back but two of my coworkers talked me in to giving in one more chance my order was wrong again I asked for pulled pork I get chicken. I ask for no beans and double rice I end up with neither.   I only have 30 minutes for lunch and it's a 20 min drive round trip with traffic so, I have to call in my order so, I can have a few minutes to eat. I have spoken to two different managers at the same location and, even then they mess up the first time I went back after work the first manager tried to refund my card and, ended up charging my a second time for the full order than gave me cash back for one so nothing was solved.    The newest manager I spoke with today was insistent that the order I got was right since the name on the order was a woman maybe they messed up my order, I told the manager I placed the ordered and, regardless what the recipe shows the meat is wrong even by the recipe. I am more frustrated with the lack of attention to simply detail that is shown for simple food I will never go to any Cafe Rio again. I rather go to Taco Bell at least they can get my order right and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"For five dollars cheaper, I could have got a salad at pollo loco, with more chicken and all the other stuff that comes on a salad. The salad tasted fine. It was just extremely overpriced and for the \"fire-grilled chicken\" another dollar extra. Plus, they hardly put any chicken on it! The dressing was good. As I said in my tip, it's really noisy in here, very difficult to understand the people making the food when they ask a question. It must be popular because the place is packed. I won't come back. Pollo loco is my Mexican salad place from now on."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, I really like it and would like to go back again. Except I agree with another reviewer about the attitudes of some of the employees. They are not pleasant. I have experienced one who wouldn't even talk. I ordered a sour cream and it sat on the other side of the counter....another employee asked what I was waiting for. I pointed at the sour cream sitting there and she just said \"OK\" and kept walking. Seriously? With that said, there are some who are super nice.   Also, orders get mixed up and they keep asking you what you want on something that isn't even yours. They need to focus on one at a time. They get caught up in trying to take everyone's order who is in line and it just gets to complicated. It makes the line move slower!  The other thing is if you're going to charge extra for sour cream and ranch (which I didn't like) at least give us a heads up. $1.00 for tomatillo ranch and .59 for a sour cream that isn't even full. Geez.   I never leave reviews but I felt like I had to. This could be an amazing place if they know what's going on. Secret shop your store, you will see!"}
{"text":"This location is a mess... I avoid dining in as much as possible. But this is literally 5 minutes away from my house and if I'm hungry for some nachos... I will come here... I'll just order out though. Haha!  The cleanliness of this place is not up to par. The staff is usually miserable and grumpy. They're ALWAYS in a rush... So I take my time ordering. I hate feeling rushed! The staff obviously has issues with each other. The cashier was telling one of the dish washers to cut some veggies up. Dishwasher responded \"it's not in my job description\". The cashier was visibly irritated. I mean, c'mon... The very slightest ounce of professionalism goes such a long way. They need to get it together."}
{"text":"I was excited to see fresh made tortillas, ordered a steak burrito, it might have had four of the tiniest pieces of steak, green sauce was good,my daughter had salmon tacos, but for 27 bucks I won't be back. Chips were burnt and mild salsa was so hot you couldn't eat it. Complained to my son later and said chipotle has more flavor, he said I could have told you that. Employees were very friendly but restaurant was filthy."}
{"text":"Never had a problem when my mom and I would go here. We decided to order online since we had a few things to do. We ordered 2 enchiladas and queso. My mom gets there and there's no queso. The lady says they'll make it and it'll be 10 minutes. Okay... 10 minutes pass, they hand her our order and there's only one enchilada. So then she had to wait for them to make the enchilada. I don't understand the point of online ordering if you get there to pickup your order and it takes longer to get your meal than just waiting in line and ordering there. Waste of time and the food did not taste good."}
{"text":"I dined here for lunch today.  The environment was friendly and there was a nice man who was bussing the tables and greeting people as they came in the restaurant.  It was my first time so the way the line worked was kind of confusing.  I got a steak burrito.  I was surprised that they don't offer to put lettuce and different toppings inside your burrito it was just the beans rice cheese and meat.  They do offer lettuce and pico on the side however I prefer that inside!  For this - I probably will stay loyal to Chipotle but I'm glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"I got the taco salad. It wasn't too bad. The barbacoa is a bit too sweet. Chicken is pretty good. The taco salad is huge! Guacomole was a bit sour, I can do without it. They're pretty fast with the orders. Not to shabby. Chips are good."}
{"text":"Generous portions and great service! I came in about an hour before closing and they had run out of one of the salsas. I only had to wait a few minutes for them to prepare some fresh salsa, but the server apologized for the wait and offered me free guacamole, sour cream, etc. Not only is the service sincere and efficient, but they give you a generous helping of beans and rice. I ordered the single tamale and it was extremely filling!"}
{"text":"No one has to ask me twice if I want to go to Cafe Rio!    It is always a top notch choice!   I love the tortillas----and everything is so fresh!  My punch ticket is my best friend.  And speaking of friends, bring a friend there for the first time so they can call out, \"First Timer!\""}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place... especially since it is right up the road from us!  I always go for the Grilled Chicken Taco combo plate and my husband loves the steak burrito that is ginormous!  They give my 15 mth old a free cheese quesedilla too!  You ahve your choice of pinto or black beans with your combo plates and they serve Horchata :) YUMMY!!  A little spendier than most Mexican places but worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing it's very clean in here and I couldn't ask for any better service the suits made right in front of you it's super fresh and very inexpensive for how good it is.if you're craving great Mexican this is the place to go.by far the best Barito you'll  every life guaranteed"}
{"text":"I usually go to be Cafe Rio in Henderson off of Stephanie, but I was at UNLV when I had a craving for some Cafe Rio. The food was still good, but the portion size seemed way smaller, and the Tortilla was not as fresh, and came without cheese. A step down from the Henderson location, but still decent."}
{"text":"I will drive out of my way 10 miles to got to the Southeastern location rather than go to this Cafe Rio. They have the slowest service and the portions seem to be smaller as well. Please open another location in the area, preferably in Southern Highlands. I think the all around service and customer satisfaction would improve that way."}
{"text":"It's easier to come to this location as its close to my house, however its gone down hill in the past 2 months.  As I was waiting to complete my order the gentleman on the line was so rude to the guy in front of me. He asked if they had corn, and the employee says \"no, this is not chipotle \" . Wow, ok. As its my turn now, I get my order quickly and proceed to check out. The girl at the register was really sweet I have to add. While I'm getting my drink there's customers stocking the soda station.  They need new management and a giant upgrade. I'll definitely make the drive to a further location to have slightly better customer service"}
{"text":"Absolutely bewildered at the high ratings for these places across the valley. Wife and I decided to pick up some food from the Blue Diamond location because our new favourite for \"quick and honest\" Mexican fare, Phat Phranks, is closed on weekends.  As I watched them build my burritos my heart sank and I knew I wasn't going to be in for a pleasant experience. The meat was wet, beans were swimming in goo and the tortillas split from the wetness as they wrapped it. My wife's bean and cheese burrito was even worse - 48.5% rice, 48.5% wet beans, 1% of a tiny sprinkle of cheese.  When we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky. I found it just edible and would rate the place 1 and a half stars overall, rounding down because it's a bit overpriced and I just didn't enjoy the taste."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying I am not a big pork fan, but Cafe Rio's sweet pork barbacoa burrito is TO DIE FOR!  I could eat this everyday and not get tired of it. I've even tried to find yucatan-style pork recipes in the attempt to duplicate this at home and it's been a \"bust\" so far....  Not too crazy about their chips; I prefer the lighter color, no cornmeal type, but I DO love their homemade tortillas and often order extras to take home.   Also love their mint limeade drink; will definitely try to duplicate that at home since I have lots of mint growing in the yard!  Between Baja Fresh and Cafe Rio; it's a \"toss\" as to which one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Love the marinated grilled chicken at Cafe Rio....very tender and flavorful especially on a taco. I always order grilled chicken tacos with rice and beans combo  and it never disappoints. Tried the chicken tortilla soup and did not care for it. Employees always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio! Better than Chipotle and any other fast food Mexican food. The only thing I don't like are the prices. It is almost $20 for everything I want! That is a little expensive, but it's worth it.   My cousin raved about this restaurant, and I did not try it until October. I have been in love since!   My favorite thing to order is the fire grilled chicken quesadilla. The order is huge - it is usually big enough for 2 meals. The tortillas are fresh and giant. you will also need to order the Queso dip. It is amazing and the best thing on the menu by far. I will sometimes dip my quesadilla in it. It is pure heaven."}
{"text":"Great food had chicken taco and soup sal had great customer service with his big smile and the other two lady in front helping him work as a team ! Overall amazing will be bring my husband here to try it out !"}
{"text":"It is very frustrating to get my order in.  I see it get incorrect and try to fix it but the employees do not hear you.    To make things worse, my order was switched with the lady in front of me. I gave up because I was hungry but let the girls at the register know.  For the record. I ordered a burrito enchilada style with fire Chicken and green sauce.   What I got was burrito enchilada style with shredded chicken and red sauce.   I was very disappointed and frustrated.   Also your assembly line was so chaotic and loud it was hard to get your employees attention.   The lady making tortillas taking orders did not communicate my party's order correct either. That is where the problem ultimately began.   I was so excited to have my work friends try Cafe Rio however I am now embarrassed as they all had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"12 noon this place is packed! I've been to this location almost half a dozen times and it's a great alternative to the options in the vicinity. They have great daily deals and the Taco Tuesday crowd is especially thick, definitely expect a line.  My go-to is the pork tacos and pico, tasty stuff, and their tortillas are great! They go through them so quickly they're usually making them on demand right there in front of you.  The price is a tad high, but you do get what you pay for. I miss Bajio, but this restaurant rightly deserves the spot and I'm glad they opened shop.  Be sure you grab a frequent customer card as you pass through the check out. After 10 stamps you get a free entree. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This cafe Rio is always running behind. I called in at 6 pm tonight to place a to go order for two salads. I got there at 645 and the salads where not even ready. Then they gave me the wrong dressings. The manager explained he was sorry for the inconvenience but this isn't the first time. Last time we used this particular location our rice was uncooked and when we called in to the store they just said \"sorry\". I guess we will just choose another place from now on."}
{"text":"I like Cafe Rio, the food is always fresh and tasty (comparing to other fast food chains). This one did not disappointed me either. The quality of the food was superb. The place was clean. The only thing they should work on is the luck of the customer service skills. Also the portions sizes were smaller comparing to the other Cafe Rio location. Had to order double meat (burrito). I would still recommend to eat here. The burrito tasted great :D"}
{"text":"I paid 14.75 for a steak burrito and a drink who turn to be a bean&rice burrito and a drink.  No meat what so ever ,maybe 2oz or so.   After the meal my stomach was exploding. The oil and salt made me not leave the bathroom for a good hour.  That's the quality of this place. Zero   Yackk ,not going back."}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner of multiple locations of Cafe Rio.  This location is the worst.  Rice is always undercooked.  Meat portions are never consistent.  Southwest limeade is also very inconsistent... sometimes way too diluted and watered down.  Service is also questionable at this location.  They have trouble when busy and there always seems to be a bottleneck at the cashier.  S Eastern location much better, even UNLV location is better, if you can stand the drive.  Update: They've improved since opening and are more consistent, with the exception of their meat portions. Sometimes they skimp a bit."}
{"text":"Jasmine made the most legit taco I have ever tasted at Rio!! Love this place and love their awesome team!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The employees are very friendly and created a fun atmosphere.  And, the food is good, too!  I hope we get a Cafe Rio in our part of Southern California soon."}
{"text":"Idk why the reviews are so low for here. I think it's great,it's like a chipotle but almost better,they even have horchata. Definitely worth a try if you haven't gone before"}
{"text":"Good location, but understaffed as hell. Look at the photo of the guy that works there. He's the boss. The customer service at this location is on point."}
{"text":"Heard Good things so have it a try on taco tuesday. Good deal and add $2 for rice and beans. Tortillas were great. Sweet pork too sweet. I liked the beef much better. They put  cilantro which I hate in the salsa so passed on that. Beans are ok and rice average. Ice machines barely worked. They tried to fix them but only a little better. Overall I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Don't understand the poor reviews! The burrito enchilada style with the medium sauce is fantastic! The service is limited as you basically tell the staff what to put on your order...thats it...a lot of times people can't make up their minds...I get frustrated with these people too as the line is normally always long and if you don't know what you want you should wait out of line until ready! Proper etiquette can not be taught to people.... Also, people are human so have a little forgiveness with the workers...this is a hectic environment for the employees here and they do a great job...all the reviews bashing them over little stupid things doesn't make sense...  This is one of the better cafe rio locations I've been to!  I recommend this place to everyone who has never been to a cafe rio and they always leave saying \"you were right\"! You won't be disappointed coming here!"}
{"text":"Wow. The bread is amazing. They make it right there in frint of you. I love red meat so the steak is awesome for me. They all seem to be nice people there and seem to be helpful. I have also tried their chicken and that is great as well. The guacamole is super fresh and tasty. Too bad its extra. The only major problem is when the staff push the tables and chairs it is so loud that it ruins the experience there. And it is super annoying. I have gone to several other cafe rios and they seem to be the same. All in all great place and ling lines. But i would go there again. PS.  The food is salty so i have to drink a ton of water at night throughout the night. I recommend for pick up as well."}
{"text":"Café Rio has decent food but the menu just seems stale to me.   Maybe I've eaten here too much over the years but I think they need to add something new.  It's not that I've had a bad meal, in fact just the opposite.  The food quality and consistency is very good between locations.  I've tried everything on their menu (and I mean EVERYTHING) and it was all good but they needs something new and exciting to keep me coming back.   Hell, I'll probably go back again anyways and eat the same stuff."}
{"text":"I love the food here so much, but the portions are terrible for the price. They charge for every little thing when the menu states that it comes with it. Example: the tostada comes with dressing and when I go to pay they charge me for the side of dressing. This type of customer service is just plain cheap. You ask your customer if they want their burrito enchilada style, but don't inform of the uncharges? This is not a good practice as a business...."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Staff is rude and their food taste processed and fake. They have no vegetarian options like sautéed veggies or anything.  Their food looks like it's been sitting for days too so nothing looks appetizing."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and there is one right near me. This restaurant was was great. The layout is awesome and it was very clean. And there is plenty of parking outside so you never have to worry about that.  The line wasn't too long and they had lots of staff on help so it made the line go by faster. Their menu is very easy you have a \"base\" whether it's a burrito or salad and you can customize it to how ever you like.  I really love their sweet Barbacoa and it's sweet and perfect for any meal you want to add it in.  They also have delicious cheese dip that they make every day and it tastes so good and it's the perfect amount of spice.  The store seems to always be busy and there never seems to be any problems at the restaurant and the never seem to run out on their selection."}
{"text":"I go here about 3 times a month. Lunch time as well as dinner time. The day crew is much more friendly and they take more care in the presentation of your food. On more than one occasion in the evening, although still tasty, the quality and the vibe given has been disappointing. The young girl tonight just kind of threw stuff together. I will still be a customer but maybe just during lunch."}
{"text":"The good: Pork Quesdilla, chips and the Salsa.  The bad: Crappy Velveeta Cheese dip masquerading as Queso.  Definitely better than Chipotle.The quesadilla was amazing, and so big I gave half to my boyfriend. The chips were nice and fresh, and the salsa, while being REALLY watery, was flavorful. The queso though.. Meh. This is actually crappy Velveeta Cheesy dip with some salsa thrown in. It's not with $5. Just get the chips and salsa. It's cheaper and tastes better. The hot sauce they gave me barely counted as mild, but they do have a nice selection of hot sauces by the drink dispenser, so I can forgive that.   The workers were nice, and quick about getting  my food out. However, I did notice them completely ignore a young woman who was trying to tell them they were out of ice. Just stood there and chattered away in spanish totally oblivious to everyone around them."}
{"text":"Love the food. And they have horchata! They screw up on 99% of the take out so is Better to come in. Very busy at lunch but worth it."}
{"text":"As far as fast food slash quick Mexican food goes this is pretty good. Queso with chips is always yummy. I enjoy the salad with tortilla on the side. My son always gets the pork barbosa. Top it off with the mint lemon aid."}
{"text":"I've been reading most of the reviews for this place and I have no clue why it's bad. Usually when I go there the service is quite quick. The food is also very fantastic! Anyways, while looking at them people mostly said that the service was slow. When I go there I'm waiting for at the most 5 minutes. Now, I don't know other people but I'm pretty sure that it's because people are impatient. I'm not calling anyone out either. I'm just letting you know the facts and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. And it's also very convenient to get to. Speaking that it's the only location around here..."}
{"text":"Awesome work on the tortillas but....  Everything was so salty it almost burned. The worst thing was the verde sauce  or what is called their medium. It was unnaturally sweet?  I'm like what? By unnaturally sweet, I mean it was like their is sugar added to the sauce. Weird and not good.   Guac good. Pico good.  Everything else I tried was, well just OK."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. The chicken I got was a little dry. Kind of a chipotle type concept except with the burritos being enchilada style."}
{"text":"Great food, and always fast, always clean at the Blue Diamond location. We love their fresh warm chips and queso, giant chicken burrito's. My wife loves the chicken tostada. The kids like to watch them roll and freshly make the tortillas right in front of you. We have also enjoyed their catering several times for team meetings."}
{"text":"I love the Sahara location! I always have friendly conversations with the staff, and depending on who's working line they remember my order(: me and my friends love coming here, it's clean and the food is bomb. Thanks for being better than the lake mead or centennial location!"}
{"text":"It's worth the drive going to another cafe rio location (Sahara or centennial location) I've worked at the lakemead location and management is very unorganized, it's very common that they won't have what you want in stock, the staff insults customers in Spanish not knowing that a majority of people are bilingual. Management treats employees horribly. Ive also heard my fair share of complaints that there were bugs in people's food."}
{"text":"Move over Chipotle, you just got burrito slapped by Cafe Rio. I can't think of one item on my plate that could be outdone by another fastish food Mexican restaurant. The tortilla was so fresh and I am still dreaming about it. The shredded chicken was my favorite while my boyfriend swears by the shredded pork. The creamy  tomatillo salad dressing was full of flavor, but the vinegarette was equally divine. This is a great place for Mexican food without having to sit and wait. However the lines can be really long during lunch and dinner hours so you can call ahead. Also, if you are taking your salad To-Go consider getting your tortilla on the side so it doesn't  get soggy on the ride home."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!  I called in my order at 11:30AM on a saturday.  Only had 3 items on my order so it wasn't a big deal.  My daughter can't eat gluten so I specified at least 3 times on the phone that she had to have corn tortillas.  I show up 45 minutes later, plenty of time to make the order only to find out that they had not even started it!  No apologies, they take my money and start my order.  At this time I again specify corn tortillas.  She tells the manager who made my order to use corn tortillas.  In the meantime they finish another togo order for someone who isn't even there.  I ask her about it and she just ignores me and yells at the staff that they are messing everything up.  Then finally my order comes and I get to the car and see they made it with flour tortillas.  So I have to go back inside because my daughter is allergic and AGAIN ask for corn tortillas.  I ask for a manager and everyone ignores me.  The manager makes it again with corn tortillas but this time with the wrong meat.  I just give up at this point and NEVER did the manager ever apologize or anything!  Worst customer service ever I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. One of the best experiences I've ever had at a semi-fast food place. Their employees were overly nice, the manager made sure she asked how our food was, very helpful, clean and the food tasted great. We came here before our softball game. This might me a weekly stop for us?!? I just can not compliment them enough. I hope whoever owns this store takes the time to appreciate who has working for them. I'm think they already do because they genuinely seem to love being there. You don't find that very often! Customer service top notch!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Still some great food but the proportions are getting smaller. They seem to be giving less esp on the meat."}
{"text":"Its ayt. Love the steak burrito swimming in cheese and sauce. But it a $1 to be like that. Not a fan of the lighting, i dont like eating in the dark."}
{"text":"I frequent Cafe Rio at the Gilbert location but occasionally come to this Rural location. I have had several negative encounters at the Rural location. I have dealt with a couple employees who were just so rude. They are always out of guacamole after 8pm and will not refill. My Horatcha was extremely watery as well. I will be avoiding the Rural location now."}
{"text":"Okay the food is okay. When I'm tired of Chipotle I go here, and vice-versa.  I always get the Sweet Barbacoa Pork, it's almost always served perfect.  My main complaint is the people who work here! They are very rude and rush you through the line. Like today, nobody was behind us and this young man made us feel like if we were a hassle. I understand not everyone has a good work day but this is the 3rd time I run into this rude individual.   I would ignore it, but I felt I write about it just to better their service.   But the BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE FOLLOWING: THEY ARE VERY STINGY! Like you ask for cheese they look at you in a bad way and add just a little bit and then charge you $1 for it!!!!! Wtf? I know it's a charge but for real? Give me what I pay for, a good reasonable amount when I'm not getting any additional toppings.  Ok I'm done talking about this place, go and try it for yourself. In the end, you'll enjoy the grub at this mediocre fast food Mexican restaurant.  Tortillas are fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"The food is very flavorful and the fresh made tortillas are delicious. I like to order the sweet pork burrito or salad. Either way, get some of the cilantro ranch. That stuff can make any meal special. Sometimes we order chips and queso dip. They have a really excellent drink selection with the standard coke fountain products but take it up a notch with pebble ice and a selection of refillable drinks like strawberry lemonade, horchata, etc.  You order in a line similar to Chipolte. You ask for what you want and don't want as you go down the line. They have one guy in that line up, right after the burritos come out of the rolling oven that really tries to rush you, he's almost always there. Maybe he's mistaking the training to be \"energetic\" with being \"pushy\". If he could switch his \"what do you want\" style to \"would you like to try\" and give you a moment to think it would be a five star experience."}
{"text":"This place is an exact imitation of chipotle but a lot worse. After waiting 40 minutes in line the place was out of steak during the middle of the day on a Saturday. Employees were rude and tried to rush everyone with their orders. The least they could have done is inform everyone that they were out of a certain ingredient to avoid waiting in line.   I ordered a burrito with chicken. The burrito barely had any meat in it and was overflowing with rice and beans. I was disgusted when I had seen their whole batch of guacamole was dark brown so I opted not to have it. The restaurant was also out of coke and their sprite tasted like water. Worst experience at a Mexican place and most definitely never coming here again. Go to chipotle trust me you'll be a lot more satisfied than eating at this place."}
{"text":"I came with my three children after a day of worship. We sat outside, as it was very warm and nice. Unfortunately, one of the employees was sitting outside smoking cigarettes with his scary skater friends who were swearing and talking about drugs. Playing music on their phones. I was very offended and I wish management would keep those scary hippies away from this establishment. Also the green chile pork is good but always makes me sick :(((("}
{"text":"My favorite fake Mexican good place in Vegas!  It's delicious, not authentic.  This particular location has some great staff and is always fast. They do tend to be less friendly during the dinner rush, but that's human nature.  I always get a salad, rotating between pork and chile roast beef. Their tortillas are the best you can get from a place of such caliber. I love them. I hear they make them with lard.  Also: horchata. Need I say mas?  (Get it?)"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time , always nice people and fast service . Very good steak burrito my favorite"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this location since they opened. We love their food, but service has become horrible. We placed an order online at 5:30 and pick up time was 6:15. Once we arrived we were told our order wasn't ready. Come to find out, our order wasn't even started. Once everything was made they then told us it would be another 20 minutes for queso. We were asked if we wanted to speak to a manager and we replied yes. After 5 minutes we then were told that they were out of chips and waiting on another batch. Finally another 5 minutes passed and chips were ready. (Whole time our burritos were sitting out getting cold). Still no manager and still no queso we took what was ready and left.   When we finally got our food home. Our kids quesadilla was missing and the guacamole was already turning brown. My husband called the store to speak to a manager. He was on hold for ten minutes before she took the call. She did offer for us to come back for the missing food, but it was just too late and too fare of a drive to even make it worth it.   We will not be going to this location ever again. We will find another restaurant to take our business."}
{"text":"Walked in just now for a steak burrito and my friend wanted a steak and chicken quesadilla. The employee proceeds to inform me that they are out of steak and chicken. How does that even happen? How does that make sense? How can you run a restaurant without any food? I wish the employee could've been a little nicer too. This should be fixed. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"Several problems with this place: my plate of food was quite a bit less quantity wise than photos, food wasn't hot, just barely warm, corn tortillas for enchiladas way too thick, no one there knew what I meant by my request for a naked burrito, too many employees milling around, and did I mention the scarce quantity portioned out by the teenage employee? There was less than a tablespoon of chicken into tacos but tons of lettuce. Qdoba blows this place away. Wish they were here!"}
{"text":"Not sure who runs this place, but the service is consistently the worst I've ever seen.  I've been to this location 4 times now, and it's never improved.  If anything, it's been increasingly worse.  It's as if the manager encourages and rewards their employees for being rude to their customers.    Some of the rudest employees I've encountered, and the whole place seems to be an unfocused mess.  I've been to other Cafe Rio's that had good food and great service.  Honestly, this location is a big stain on the name of Cafe Rio.  I'm surprised someone from their corporate office hasn't pulled the plug on this place.   The entire staff needs replacing ASAP!   You kind of lose your appetite after being treated like you've ruined their entire day just by walking through the front door."}
{"text":"I'm not going to deny one bit, the food was pretty good. I got the barbacoa burrito and the meat was really tender and sweet. Nothing was too dry, but that could also be the result of the wet beans and sauce they put in the burrito. The problem with that is that you cannot pick up the burrito and eat it with your hands, you're going to need a knife and fork. That was one downside of the food and it's not one of the cheaper places either.   The food is quite pricy for the amount that is given. Chipotle is slightly cheaper and quite similar. That being the first time i went to Cafe Rio, they knew i was a beginner and asked tricky questions. When you order, they ask after they form your burrito if you want it enchilada style. I said no as well as my friend behind me and they did it with his and they charge you .95 cents more for it! Is it really worth it? i highly doubt it especially since it's just sauce and cheese. They don't even tell you these things cost more money, they just ask you and make you fall into their trap. Tricky people.  Bottom line, food is good, kind of pricy, and the people are tricky. Not an everyday kind of place if you don't have the money to spend and it's not so bad if you know the menu and style of the place and how you order food."}
{"text":"Order online! This place is always busy and I was happy to walk in sign my receipt and go back home. Everything was made correctly and had great flavor.....this will def be a new quick fix to dinner when I dont' feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Just go to Costa Vida and save yourself some time. Their sauces are too salty and their steak is not as good as Costa Vida. I don't care which one came first, Costa Vida dumps on Cafe Rio, hands down."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan  of Mexican food, but this was my second  time and I think it's pretty good.   My daughter got a chicken  quesadilla, which came with rice and chips. Not a bad size kids meal- wish they offered other things in a kids meal.  I got the tacos with grilled chicken  I was pleased with it just wished they put a little bit more meat.  Most of the people working were very friendly except one girl. Who was very rude when we were asking questions. My daughter left her purse on the chair and after calling the place as soon as we realized it they were able to hold on to it for us... thank goodness for honest people"}
{"text":"Got four salads for lunch. Each of the salad had hair in them-some long and some short whisker like. I really wanted to like it, because I had heard so many positive reviews from friends. I work too hard to waste my money on food with hair."}
{"text":"Ok-I know this is Cafe Rio but I have to write a review about this location. My Mom, husband, and I went here on 10/31. They were totally slammed, but the line moved quickly and the service was great. The cashier, Daniel, was especially kind. My Mom teased him a bit and he took it in stride, laughed, and made our day.  This location was recently renovated and it was a huge improvement. It is much brighter and there appears to be more seating. I am a fan of the tostada-get it with a flour tortilla! I don't do the salads because I feel like I waste the tortilla, but if you get a tostada with the flour tortilla it's almost the same and gives you just enough tortilla to add a few cards to your meal.  Thank you for the great service, especially Daniel! We'll be back to this location for sure!"}
{"text":"It can be difficult to review chain restaurants/businesses because the food is the same. However, the service can really set a certain location apart. My husband and I eat here often and stopped by last night for dinner. I always get the sweet pork tostada with a flour tortilla rather than the crispy corn one. The reason I would give this location four stars is that they aren't stingy with their portions. Often I find that at Chipotle, Blaze, Cafe Rio, etc. that I always have to ask them to add more rice, cheese, etc. to my item. I have never had that issue at this particular Cafe Rio, and the food is consistently good. They also don't ever charge me extra for getting a 4oz salad dressing as opposed to the 2oz that comes standard with the tostada. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I so badly want to give this place 5 stars. I LOVE the food, if this review was based solely on food it would get 5 stars no questions asked. But unfortunately I have received awful service 2 out of 3 times I've been to this location.   The first two times I came to this particular cafe rio I wanted to call corporate and complain, but I am not one of those people. I even delayed writing a Yelp review because I didn't want to be one of those 1 star complainers so I left it alone.   After the first two awful visits I swore I would NEVER come back to this location. However, I work literally across the street and was craving their coconut shrimp tacos. So here I found myself giving this cafe rio one more try. It was afternoon and heavily busy but I was pleasantly surprised to see they added exactly what I wanted (coconut shrimp tacos) on the menu full time instead of them just being available once a week. So much win. Line went by quick. Customer service was great, food was even greater.   I will visit this location again and hopefully can receive the same great customer service I did yesterday. :)"}
{"text":"I can't even explain fully how awesome this food was. I got the shredded chicken salad. Omg! It was amazing. The line was so long that I almost left, but instead I ordered it on my phone and went to the home goods store for 20 minutes. Well worth the wait. Soooooooooo Gooooooooood!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here. Website says they are open till 11 and doors were locked at 10:14. I been to this location several times and keep telling myself to stop because of them being out of items. They also don't keep the area clean where all the meat, sauces, lettuce, etc... is kept. Staff has always been nice but noticed they wear their uniforms sloppy."}
{"text":"My co-worker took me here and the food was delicious.  I shared a pork burrito medium sauce enchilada style (really big), queso and chips. The queso was really good.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I really want to give this location more than 3 stars. Nice staff, great food. The problem? The last few times I've been there I found myself saying gee...there's hardly any meat in my sweet pork salad! You guys are getting very skimpy on the servings."}
{"text":"No wonder they have 2 1/2 stars. It's prepped like Chipotle, Chronic Taco and any other pre made food like Panda.  I can't understand why it takes 30 minutes to serve barely 10 people in line.  Then they throw away one of my orders ?  Cashier says it's made fresh ? How can it be made fresh when it's sitting in a bin ?  Then they pick up a salad bin to refill salad -- using the same gloves he supposedly should be using thongs ?  We shall see what the health department finds."}
{"text":"I got this recommendation from friends that live in Vegas.  They liken this place to a Chipotle and I love Chipotle so I thought I give Cafe Rio a try.  Located near UNLV and a close drive from the airport so you can hit it up on your from picking up friends from the airport as you head your way towards the Strip.  The decor is nice.  Not as modern and clean as Chipotle or Baja Fresh but this place has more of a real Mexican restaurant feel instead of a fast food chain.  I ordered the Barbacoa Burrito with some enchilada sauce on the sauce.  My friends were raving about the barbacoa but I was a underwhelmed.  Even though the meat was very tender and they packed quite a bit of meat in the burrito, the meat was WAY too sweet for my liking.  It was overwhelming and it pretty much took over all other flavors within the burrito.  My other friends had the chicken and they really enjoyed it because it was very moist.  Beside the burrito is a bed of lettuce and pico de gallo.  It is a very filling meal for being just a burrito with some veges on the side and for around $8.  The staff were cordial and efficient.  There were tables all around so you should not have problems looking for a seat.  I think this place is worth another try but with another meat.  Also remember to grab a stamp card if you are going to be a frequent visitor to Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Like the chicken, love the drink fountain because a person can refill horchata: nobody gives free refills on horchata."}
{"text":"Food was very, very good. The burrito we had had a ton of chicken put into it and we didn't have to pay for sour cream, which was nice.  As for the two-star rating, the customer service was trash. We interacted with 3 people and they all were very rude, very short and very sloppy. One woman seemed as if she was acting this way because she was ready to get off work - which was exactly what ended up happening.  In short, come for the food, not the service. Order to-go. Always."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I came in today around 10:45 am. Asked them if they could throw together some easy fixings for approximately 10ppl. They stood there in awe that I would ask. Someone came over and I asked them again if they could put something together. I said I really don't care what it is. Maybe just some rice n beans and maybe some chips and salsa. The manager was sitting at a table and refused to even talk to me. He kept sending one of his Staff to tell me to have everyone order Individual meals. Well that is out of the question to stand in line and get 10 separate meals. I was ready a day willing to spend over $200 for their food. I will never again go to a cafe rio. Mind you, there was no one in the restaurant except staff and myself. I am appalled they wouldn't even try to accommodate my request. I do catering pretty frequently and spend over  $2000.00 a month  on food and entertainment. Never again cafe rio....never again ."}
{"text":"Went this morning right when they opened and the door was not unlocked. Once the door was unlocked no customer service!  None! How are you good morning nothing, if this is how they are right when they open I'm afraid to go when busy. They may not even acknowledge you!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. You can go as unhealthy or healthy as you like! The meat portions could be bigger: around 5oz would be awesome. I think the above could go towards just about every Cafe Rio out there. For this one in particular though - I find it odd that the management allows employees to park right in front, thereby forcing patrons to park over by the bank. It's not a huge deal, but it's not how I'D run a business."}
{"text":"A very popular location for quick service Mexican food. I tend to arrive early for lunch or dinner so I'm not stuck in line - which can take an additional 10-15 minutes. Homemade tortillas are excellent and they sell them  to go. My favorite dish is chicken tacos on wheat tortillas. They come with cheese, shredded chicken, lettuce, and pico de gallo. Beans and rice on the side which are very flavorful. They have an app that's lets you pay and earn rewards. They seem to be more generous than most restaurants when it comes to points and rewards."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, now its kind of a dump. It took forever to order because there was only on dude working and his coworker was just standing there. The man before me ordered carnitas and none of them knew what that was..then rhey just started looking and asking each other what is that. I admit the customer could have just said the pork or just pointed.   I ordered the enchiladas and my rice had little hard pieces from drying out. My food was cold when I ate it. There was a tomato stem in my food.   The place is a mess. I took a picture of just one section but the whole serving station was a hot mess. There was guac on the side that turned brown from being there that long. Sour cream everywhere, in the guac, the lettuce, the window. Its just not ok guys."}
{"text":"This location just keeps going downhill. The food is good but the customer service is horrible, they seem to not understand you so your order turns out wrong, and their portions (for the salad at least) have gotten smaller. Last night was the worst quality and service we've experienced.   Went to Costa Vida tonight, yup still craving Mexican, and got (basically) the same salad that I did at Cafe Rio. What a difference! Friendly and helpful staff and HUGE portions!!   From here on, we'll pick Costa Vida over Cafe Rio every time."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio. It's an exceptional place. There food is from heaven. My experience last night was from hell. I walked in thinking the coupon on my cafe rio app for a free burrito was golden. I get up to the register after ordering the perfect burrito. The cashier tells me she doesn't do the coupons. So the thing is I already opened my coupon so now it's gone forever and I have to pay for this burrito in front of me.  Really cafe rio? Really?"}
{"text":"This is my first time at the Stephanie location but have been to the Eastern store a few times as well.  After trying to give Cafe Rio a fair shake, I'm sad to say I'm not a fan.  The good thing is that both Henderson locations are consistent:  loud and busy but service is efficient and food tastes the same at both places.    I'm just not into their meat being super soggy with cooking liquids dumped right into your aluminum container.  Very disappointing to have your nachos turn into a soggy clump because of the liquids in the meat.  I don't like the hot liquid wilting my salad either.    I do like that they actually have \"salad lettuce\" rather than just shredded \"garnish lettuce\".  But it's not enough for me to give them another chance.  Sorry Cafe Rio, I'll keep going to Chipotle even though their \"salad\" consists of thinly sliced lettuce."}
{"text":"It gets busy so I come in early. But then sometimes the door is still locked because they forgot to open it.  They're still prepping, which is fine with me. Love the shredded beef tacos and their fresco salsa.  Wish the salsa was more consistent..sometimes it's hot - sometimes it's not.  I prefer it hot but I just want consistency.    The windows have lots of kids greasy hand marks. The tables and chairs often have chips and \"stuff\". They're cleaning the place better but the closing crew needs to do a better job.   The staff is nice. I'll keep coming back as long as the food is good and I get \"free\" food with their loyalty program :-)"}
{"text":"I always see their sign for a green chili burrito when I'm driving to work and finally the hubby and I stopped by for lunch.  They offer burritos, tacos, tostadas, quesadillas,enchiladas, nachos and salad. I opted for the tostada and the hubby got the burrito. The portion size for both plates were pretty big and food wasn't bad. However the prices aren't bad but I felt it was a bit pricey. For two meals plus a drink , our order came out to $27. I would have rather gone to chipotle for the price and we could have gotten us some chips and guacamole and it still would have been cheaper then what we paid here."}
{"text":"I ended up ordering a salmon burrito and it was absolutely amazing. I usually order the regular steak burrito, and I never heard of a salmon burrito. It was totally worth it. I can eat this for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"The food was made quickly and the staff was super friendly.  The food tastes fresh and the portions are ginormous.  Get the lemonade.  It's made fresh and has mint in it.  I could just fill up on that.  I would recc the grilled chicken on anything."}
{"text":"This rating should have been 5 stars, unfortunately over the past year or so since they have opened, I've slowly watched the service go down the drain, the food gets five stars but the people making it get one star. The only person who seems to always be on the ball is the cashier. Be prepared to have to explain multiple times what you want in your meal, and then watch them to make sure they do it right. Also if you order the taco special, I've been asked multiple times how many tacos I want ( the menu options are a one taco meal or a two taco meal...) but when I ask the guy behind the counter how many it comes with he said as many as I wanted and refused to give the correct answer even after insisting to know how many the meal CAME with. I've asked him this on three separate visits  ( same guy) to see if he will give the right answer and I always get the same answer. Its a good thing their food and drinks are great because it is a pain to have to supervise your own order being made!"}
{"text":"Me and my family absolutely love Cafe Rio. Everything we have tried is been delicious. Our favorite is their salads. They are amazing. Its nice to see how they make the tortillas right in front of you. Being a military family, we greatly appreciate their military discount. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Since I have only been to Cafe Rio Mexican Grill on two occasions I am going to keep this review as short as possible. If the score was based on food alone, Cafe Rio would slide by with five stars. Unfortunately my scores are based on service, price, and cleanliness too. Las Vegas, we have a problem.  Sure I'd rather eat at Cafe Rio than Baja Fresh, On The Border, and Lindo Michoacan (pardon spelling if wrong, I don't care enough to look up that over-priced mess-taurant's name up). But the problem is that the staff (including the cooks) are rude and the place is dirty. I remember several months ago when I had to drive by the place everyday there were stacks of boxes and garbage in the back. I've worked in restaurants for years and we always broke down the boxes. There is a specific bad experience that one of my family members had at this location with some of the cooks. None of your business.  If all you care about is good Mexican food, go to Cafe Rio. But heed my warning that you might be paying a lot of money to fill your stomach if you are anything like me. The perfect (well... maybe not PERFECT) Friday Night : Marvin Gaye, candles, and a sweet pork barbacoa taco from Cafe Rio Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"We placed an online order 7:15pm, website said we could pick it up at 7:45pm. We sent our son to pick it up and he waited until 8:05pm. Then I called and spoke to a rude manager. We do not recommend ordering take out from this location. Quicker to order there. We paid $51 for 3 people to eat."}
{"text":"I just don't get the appeal of Cafe Rio, everyone I know loves the food here.  It's clean and the service is good but it's way over priced.  I wouldn't call the food fresh.  My friend and I had skipped breakfast so we came in for lunch right at 11:00 when they opened.  He got a barbacoa burrito and I got a chicken salad.  You can see the food as they serve it up and the beans and the guac looked old, no doubt they were from the day before.  The salad was subpar.  My friend loved his burrito though, I had a bite and the barbacoa was too sweet.  I will be back because all of my friends love it and I appease them but I will not be happy about it."}
{"text":"I Can't get enough of this place. Home made tortillas. Green sauce on everything. As healthy as you want to make it!  Home made tortillas! The lines move fast. Mmmmmmmmm. HOME MADE TORTILLAS!!  You must eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place. Today was second in the row when service was absolutely sucks, they cut on portion and the entire restaurant including kitchen area was filthy. We will probably not return here anymore. So sad to see a good place go down the drain."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from eating here so needless to say i do not recommend. My boyfriend and I ate everything the same except he ate at Canes across the street while i ate at cafe rio. I'm sick and he's not so it's pretty evident where i got sick from."}
{"text":"Love coming here on a Sunday evening after a long weekend camping...No dinner to cook, the kids are fed and the other half of the burrito is tomorrow's lunch for everyone! Woo hoo!  We like the pork barbacoa  with hot sauce and black beans or pinto and the vegetarian burrito with black beans and mild sauce :-)  The service has never disappointed us."}
{"text":"This location has the absolute worst customer service the employees are so goddamn rude. This is a continuous problem here. Better believe I'm calling cooperate."}
{"text":"Soooo excited about Cafe Rio having coconut shrimp everyday! I've been coming to either this location or the one on Sahara 4 times a week for a coconut shrimp salad. I came here today to get a little bowl of heaven and after standing in line for 20 minutes I was told by the manager they aren't allowed to make a coconut shrimp salad. ONLY the tacos are permitted. I told her they had been up charging me for the shrimp and I'd be more then happy to comply. She said no then yelled next. I was pretty ruffled by this experience because my past ones have been pretty decent. I guess I'll be sticking to the Sahara location even though it's a ways from my house."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is amazing. I love the food and the prices are reasonable for how much food you get. We've probably been to cafe rio over 100 times now (not exaggerating) but this specific location seems to struggle with their consistency/service. For example, having dressing with your salad is usually assumed but they forget to even ask. Sometimes they fail to put all the items on the burrito/salad unless you specifically request it. This might seem petty but since we've been coming here, we've always assumed these things so I forget to ask and then we get home and find out when it's too late. Also, sometimes they put a lot less of each ingredient. We will continue to come back but likely avoiding this location if possible."}
{"text":"4 of July Chipotle was closed so I decided to give this place a try. Workers were very un-friendly, the food was not good and the cost for a burrito bowl was over $14 that's with out a drink!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for several years, so it's time for a review.  I love everything I've eaten here, but my fave is the burrito enchilada style. It's a sizable portion so arrive hungry. The mild, green sauce is my go to, but they offer spicy sauce options too. The chicken and beef are both delicious. The grilled meat wasn't worth the extra cost. I much prefer the whole wheat tortilla, but you have to ask for it because the counter staff don't offer it.  The beverage center is terrific as well and has a big selection including delicious horchata."}
{"text":"Ok Cafe Rio, I'm very disappointed with you.  I eat or at least used to eat at Cafe Rio about 1-3 times per week.  I can agree with some of the other reviews regarding customer service, but I always ignored it because they generally make my food correctly. Plus the food is good and portions are huge.  Well, I recently took a break from dairy, which makes me very sad, but it is what it is.  Considering I usually order the grilled chicken tostada with creamy Ranch type dressing I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't taste the same without dairy. My friend recommended I get avocado instead of sour cream. Great idea, right?  So I order my salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no dressing. Oh wait can I sub avocado for the sour cream?  Counter guy: doesn't answer, just puts it in my bowl. Ok. Great.  I get to the checkout and the cashier tells me it will be $. 95 to add guacamole. So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing? She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total.   Normally, I may have said something, but I'm so tired of having to argue or complain to receive appropriate customer service.  I think I'll give my normal Cafe Rio another try (on Eastern) but if I get the same treatment I may just be over this place. Obviously they don't care about my business.  It's frustrating because the amount of guacamole that you receive is paltry. I mean for a dollar I should at least get a full scoop.  I used to rave about this place to anyone that would listen, but now I'll take my business to a place that can accommodate my dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Great, quick foods. For months I only ate the marinated roasted beef tostada, and I was very happy with it. Until a friend talked me into trying the grilled steak. Delicious! Then she got me to try the grilled chicken, now typically, I'm more of a red meat girl, and rarely eat chicken. Its normally to bland for me. However, this is some of the best chicken I've tasted. Highly recommend! Now it's the only thing I get. I can't vouch for the shredded chicken, as I've never tried it, but I was told it isn't as good. You can't beat the prices. And I also love their iced tea. I usually take my food to go, but they have a lot of room to dine in. The place is usually busy but the line moves quick."}
{"text":"I like this better then Chipotle BUT they have some easy things to work on.   1. Not everyone there knows exactly who , what , where and how to make a burrito the way you do. A little coaching, questions and helping you customer goes a long way.  2. Have the food ready more then a 1/2 hour AFTER you open your doors.  3. Train the staff before throwing them on the line.  4. Offer samples when you know they have no idea what they want.  5. DRAIN the darn meat before throwing it in a tortilla. NO ONE likes mush."}
{"text":"I've been to other Cafe Rio's and they are busy and make their food fresh. This restaurant is the WORST!!! Employees don't care about the customers. You wait forever to be served and they aren't even busy.  And the managers don't care either, they are having a meeting in the dining room while a line of customers are just standing there. They say the tortillas are made fresh, they are not!!! Go to the one by chandler mall or at san tan - they are much more friendlier and make the tortillas fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here literally hundreds of times so finally decided to review. Overall the food is excellent and keeps me coming back. The customer service used to be good, but now it's below average.  Still, for fast Mexican food, it's hard to beat. Don't forget to download the app and get points, and you'll have a free meal in no time amigo"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location that I've been to (much better than Stephanie & Eastern.) Both the Stephanie & Eastern locations have run out of certain things when I've gone, which I find extremely odd & inconvenient, but not this location. This location also has the best customer service & I've never left disappointed. However, I still feel that it's overpriced."}
{"text":"I went on Thursday because I was so excited for the daily special, which was tamales. I was so disappointed when they told me they were completely out. How do you not prepare enough for your SPECIAL & run out? I came three hours before it closed too, so it's not like I was being an unreasonable customer last minute. I was disappointed as that was literally the only reason I went there. The staff didn't care, at all. I brought it to their attention. Out of frustration after buying something else that was overpriced that I didn't want to eat (I brought someone with me so I couldn't just leave), I ended up talking to a manager. Won't be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Worst Cafe Rio experience of my life. Wow.  Went in for taco Tuesday at 9pm. Didn't get serviced right away; which is not a problem. But the service I did get when I got it, was a problem. The girl that helped us looked so miserable, I couldn't even stand it. Like did your puppy die or something?   Ordered 3 chicken tacos for myself and my friend ordered 3 steak tacos but they only had enough steak for one taco and she said they weren't going to make more for the rest of the night. Which is kind of weird.. you're not going to make any more steak at all for the night?!?! So anyone else that comes in for be next hour is going to be denied steak for their meal? Weird. So weird. He ended up with one steak taco and two chicken tacos, just for the record.   Anyway. The girl that served us was so miserable and obviously did not want to be there. Dear girl with the tattoo on your elbow; re-evaluate your priorities and if you don't want to work at Cafe Rio, then don't. Don't ruin my experience because you had a bad day or something.   Service 1/10 Food 10/10"}
{"text":"This was my first time here..  The line was crazy long.. ok it was Friday at the time everyone gets off queue, fair enough..  From check in to leaving the restaurant clocked in at 30 min, which for a fast casual place is way way too long.  There were 9+ staff members yet while they were all doing something, it added up to nothing bc each person was moving exceptionally slow.   I know they have to do a chant when you order certain items, but I told then I was in a BIG rush and haha please skip the songs. Nope. They sang. Please just make the food!  All my questions seemed to confuse- how spicy is the habanero pork? What comes with the nachos? What are my sauce options when making my burrito enchilada style? Is there an up-charge for that ( the staff didn't seem to know what an up charge was- needless to say I ended up with a few).  I had money on my rewards card from a large catering order. I asked them to redeem it- the cashier hear \"earn\" so I got charged on my credit card the full amount. He was really sweet about the mix up- called a manager over- she reversed the charges and used my points- got home and checked my credit card the next day... no money refunded :/   The food was good- nachos needed the ingredients layered, otherwise nice. I got the habanero pork burrito and used their tomatillo creama sauce as my. \"Enchilada style\" option,. Really good.  I will try this location again bc it's convenient and they have a wider selection of options (& are better tasting) compared to Chipotle ."}
{"text":"Meh...a coworker gave this place rave reviews, but my experience last night was quite underwhelming.   First off the staff was VERY unwelcoming. No smiles, no hello how are you, no thanks for visiting. Just dry irritated faces and energy. All six staff members that I interacted with were less than enthused about their jobs. Irritated about the customers, irritated with each other.   I assumed it was me just being used to Chipotle's stellar customer service until the customer in front of me whispered to me, \"is it just me or are these workers very unfriendly? I feel anxious just standing in line, like they don't want us to be here\" So, no it's wasn't just me!  Setting the service aside the food was just ok. My wet chicken burrito was WAY WAY too salty. Like can't eat as much as you want cause it's so salty. I must have drank 32oz of water just to compensate! The only good thing about the dish was the large amount of lettuce on the side that turned into a sort of salad. My husbands tostada was nothing thrilling per his report.   Definitely won't be returning.   Oh yeah, and they were out of guacamole  and judging by the other reviews I don't think this is an irregular occurrence."}
{"text":"Make sure you have lots of time on your hands if your going here. So once again I decided to order to go from this location of Cafe Rio... I should know better by now. This is the third time in the last two months I have ordered and they just cannot get it together. They gave me an online quote time of 40min, ok cool. I show up 10 min early and expect to wait a little, but not 25 min, past the time it was to be ready,really! I could have just come in and walked the line and been done quicker, as they were only seven people in line when I arrived. Then a \" supervisor\" (tall, brown hair, glasses,heavier set) just tells me as well as another costumer who has also waited for his Togo order, \"sorry it's taking a while\" and walks away,not offering anything to help. He literally walked a round the whole time, looking around,the only thing I saw him actually do that was productive was pick up a tray from the dining room and walk it back,while the rest of the staff is running around working; he offered no help. Then I see what I assume is a manager who is in a red shirt standing in the back on her cell phone, also offering no help while customers are waiting. I will order and go to Cafe rio again because of their consistent food (only reason I even gave 2 stars) however it will be a while before I come back to this location, if ever."}
{"text":"Two words: very crappy. This location sucks compared to the location on blue diamond. Not very welcoming at all. When taking your order, they're not even listening. They're too busy worrying about what's going on with each other than their customers. I wanted a simple quesadilla and a salad and they couldn't even get that right. No one is communicating with each other and they end up giving my quesadilla to someone else. There is no customer service at ALL. Jees, pretend you care a little. Honestly, they need to let go of everybody including the manager. Whoever it is, they clearly do not know what they're doing. Please get a better team!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast food Mexican food, I would definately recommend going here, and to this location specifically too. I don't see why there is so many bad reviews here because I've been here probably twenty times with no problem. They always provide fast and efficient service, the Food is outstanding for the quality it has and the quickness, but the prices are a bit steep, not like Taco Bell or Del Taco. I love this place and I will continue to go back, great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner with my family and the friendliness of the staff was amazing!! The manger April really cares about her employees her customers"}
{"text":"Always wonderful! Friendly staff and great, fresh food. It is on the noisy side thought, but what do you expect for a family friendly resturaunt? The food is consistant at every location which is a plus as well. Never had a bad meal. Tamala Thursday is amazing! I am not a huge fan of their pork barbacoa, but I think it is either a love it or hate it type thing. I do love thier fire grilled chicken and highly suggest it. Their house dressing for their salads is amazing! I'd suggest to anyone for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Found a Cafe Rio and stood in a forever long line on Tuesday for their delicious Barbacoa tacos!! The tacos were so delicious and so were their quesadillas however I was SUPER BUMMED OUT, not to mentioned SUPER GROSSED out to find some kind of a metal cap bolt cap looking thing in my salsa as I went to scoop some out!! I saw another post on here while reading reviews in line that someone found a Piece of plastic Wrap in their salad... Can you say quality check?!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is part of our regular lunch rotation at my work.  My boss loves the barbacoa, though I personally find it too sweet.  I prefer the grilled chicken or steak, tamales, and the quesadillas.  We often order as a  large group and I LOVE the online ordering system - it allows for a ton of customization and is very easy to navigate.  They are very good at getting our orders right, too.  Their organizational efforts in catering to the work-lunch crowd has earned them a fifth star from me.  The salsas are all very good, I love the hot red sauce and the medium green tomatillo, and the pico de gallo is outstanding.  Everything is fresh and made to order and the portions are generous.  I've never had a bad meal here and even though the menu is small, there is enough variety to please pretty much everyone.  Service is quick and friendly and they look like they're having a good time behind the counter.... \"EXTRA MEAT!!\" - my goofy boss loves making them do that!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place and everything good. Great food; I especially love the flavorful rice and the shredded beef tacos. Also a big fan of the natural drinks in the self-serve drink section. I will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"A good experience all around.  The food at Cafe Rio is pretty consistent, regardless of the location. I always go with a burrito enchilada style and never leave disappointed or still hungry. The staff at this location seemed in good spirits and have a nice setup, larger than any other Cafe Rio I've been to. If you download their app, they'll throw you discounts from time to time, including $5 off on a visit during your birthday week. All in all, Cafe Rio is a step up from Chipotle; a little more authentic in taste, slightly bigger portions, and a more colorful/Mexi-style look inside. Cafe Rio is always a solid option when hunger strikes while in any part of the valley."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food but their workers need to speed up the pace ... Waiting in line at a fast food place for 40 mins is unacceptable!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location multiple times, and everytime it's disappointing. Most recently, I had a to go order that was placed online 30 min prior. It wasn't ready- part of it hadn't even been started. The young lady working kept calling me \"honey\" and \"miss\" which is especially ridiculous since I am likely 30 years her senior! Food was average at best and there were no napkins, utensils, etc in the bag which really sucked since we were moving and didn't have any of our own handy. You would think that for the cost of everything ($35+ for 2 salads & a burrito) they could throw in some plastic forks! The staff seems out of sync and there never appears to be anyone in charge, just a bunch of young kids scrambling around trying to manage the line. This was probably my last visit."}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews, but the customer service here is by far the worst possible.. The food is great but the employees act like they don't get paid for being there. Slow and angry"}
{"text":"My mom suggested this place after church on Sunday. She said it was like Chipotle but WAAAAAAYYYY better. Seeing how I wasn't a fan of that style of restaurant I was hesitant to go...but hey...it was free (mom was buying) and it didn't break my no eating out challenge (again...mom was buying).   We roll in...monkeys in tow...and notice how festive and colorful this place was. Very nice for kids. I ordered one of each of the special tacos (mahi-mahi and spicy crispy shrimp), rice and beans, and a drink. We also shared the chips and queso. Holy cow! The tacos had fresh made tortillas, creamy tomatillo dressing (think tomatillo ranch), huge pieces of cilantro and generous portions of meat. The drink bar was amazing. Not only did they have Diet Dr. Pepper and orange soda (my favorite)....they have fresh mint limeade! It was so freaking tasty. My kids had 2 cups each (and lots of potty trips after).   I pounded down my food like it was my last meal (super lady like). It was like Heaven and I now am a fan of the designer burrito concept again. Thank you Cafe Rio.   PS: Don't tell them its your first time eating there...they will break out into song."}
{"text":"I am shocked by how incompetent the people who work at this establishment are. I have ordered from them four-five times and every single time they have found some new ingenious way to mess up the order. Twice I have called and ordered over the phone and when I showed up to pick up my dinner, they could not find my order. I mean, seriously?? I get hiring young people, but YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME TRAINING or at least hire people who have the mental capacity to get an order right... the show \"Are You Smarter Than a Third Grader?\" comes to mind.  After multiple times of ordering from here and being frustrated by the order being messed up, lost, or something else crazy like they are out of \"rice, beans and tortillas\" (True story), I was craving their Queso dip and decided to order from them again... bad idea. My husband showed up and they had two orders for him and neither was right. Then, we bring the food home and everything is cold and messy. I mean food slopped all over the place where a soup kitchen could have done it better.  The owners here are either ignorant or careless."}
{"text":"The food was fine. My main problem with this location was customer service, they were so rude. I came in for a pick up and my food wasn't even ready, I ordered it at 1:30 and a set time to pick it up at 2:30. I had to wait for my food- it would've been quicker to go through the line."}
{"text":"Started back to school shopping last night and we were near a Cafe Rio. I've had it before, but the SBL (Sexy Bearded Lover) & Mini Me had not.  Walked in to the joint and it was super busy like packed. Everyone in there looked like they had been swimming all day...hot pink faces, raccoon eyes, and that I'm so hungry I could I eat my hand look of hunger. Wile in line we were able to watch the tortilla ladies work their magic. Um SBL and I watched the tortillas spin like a record player and instantly felt like we had gone on too many rides at the fair. Kudos to those chicks who work that crazy invention on a daily basis, gesh!  Ordering at Cafe Rio makes you understand what a traffic cop feels like when he blows his whistle and holds his hands up. It's loud in there and there is so much going on down the line it's amazing they can even focus.  SBL ordered the taco chicken salad and I ordered the sweet pork quesadilla, oh momma!! That sweet pork measures so good it's on the stupid meter. I love it, and we get each other. SBL wondered why all the lettuce and everything else had to be placed on the top. I said because it looks pretty, but I'm sure there's some science behind it. In line there was so many orders being filled at once, our food turned into keep your eye on the white ball under the cup game. We lost Mini Mi's quesadilla a couple times, but it always found its way back to us.  We finally made it to the register and upon checkout we were pretty sure they didn't charge us for everything, but honestly we couldn't tell you what they missed because it was so dang hectic in there. We were so glad to walk out the door. Not all Cafe Rio's are created equal I guess.  The food was super tasty as always, not sure SBL was sold tho.  PS. If ever you want dessert...get the tres leches cake. It's so good all you can do is shake your head and hold up your finger in the air to shush all questions until that heavenly moment of chewing has finished."}
{"text":"I have seen these popping up all over and we went to the location by Sprouts in Gilbert.  It was slightly better than I expected and was impressed with the simplicity of the menu as far as meats and then either burrito/salad/taco/quesadilla.  One of the best offerings is a FREE nino quesadilla for children under 6.  I had green chili pork and sweet pork tacos and both were good.  The pork was a tad greasy, but the flavor was great and portions were good.  $8.79 for two tacos with rice and beans.  They also have a nice beverage bar with some Mexican options.  Overall very good, and will definitely be going back to checkout $2 taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Big portions. It goes downhill from there. No flavor in any of the toppings (shredded chicken, green sauce). And the lettuce was placed in the container dripping wet, which means my burrito was soggy from sitting in water."}
{"text":"The food quality is still excellent but the fallen to a very low level. It seems like everyone is on their first day on the job.  The food got cold waiting for the cashier to figure out how to ring people up... the servers we very short with customers bordering on rude. There was drama at the phone in - pick-up counter because of how unorganized the staff was ... but all three of us loved our food.. it took over ten minutes to get a lid for the leftovers because nobody wanted to pay attention to customers standing by the register. This is a great restaurant.... it used to be so busy we couldn't eat there for lunch ....I can understand why it's slower now."}
{"text":"I love the food at any Cafe Rio but my God... never order take out from this location. They will either screw it up or it won't be ready or both. The whole point of ordering ahead of time online is for it to be ready to go when you get there. That is never the case here, and half the time when you tell them you're there for a pick up they seem surprised. I would be more understanding if it was busy at the times I've gone in but it isn't. This last time was the limit for me. Ordered tres leches cake and they didn't even know if they had it because, shocker, they hadn't even started making my order when I walked in to pick it up...."}
{"text":"O M G! My friend took me here and I just fell in love with the food. Large portions, super tasty and the tortillas are awesome! I tried their salad with steak and house dressing, the tamales (pork and chicken), and the nachos.  The salad was huge, extremely tasty, and filling. The nachos must be eaten right away. If you let it sit too long, the cheese gets hard and hard to eat. The tamales were delicious. I liked the chicken over the pork.  The sugar free strawberry lemonade was so refreshing and so was the limeade.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat here often. As much as I love Chipotle, this was much better than that!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Not as much of a dinner place, but I guess you could opt for one of their massive burritos.  I had one of their salads, which are pretty massive and served on a tasty tortilla shell. They use plenty of chicken and offered a tasty cilantro dressing. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a mexican style salad but I reiterate that the portion was very impressive. My friend was only able to finish half of hers and I was pretty stuffed by the time I got through mine. The chicken is well seasoned, the salsas are good.   I guess what I'm saying though, is that as good as this place was, it didn't blow me away or impress me anymore than a routine trip to Chipotle would.  I definitely recommend you try it out though-- if you are a fan of trendy mexican food you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great service and a good place to grab a quick post-workout meal after killing it in the gym."}
{"text":"I just love coming to my neighborhood Cafe Rio. They have such a friendly staff. I especially love how they recognize their regular customers with a huge smile and small talk. I so adore little Ms Elmira who is always at the register and has the biggest smile. She really makes a regular customer feel appreciated. Special thanks to the Maddam, (manager) in the yellow polo with the beautiful smile and big heart. #forever a customer"}
{"text":"I've started to wonder what the folks in this state are thinking. The food here is below average mush at best. Ninety percent of the patrons here are under 30. It is loud and raucous here and people have trouble finding a table. We spent $30 for a tasdado, 2 enchiladas, and quesadillas. Food is served in a to-go container, no plate, no silverware, just plastic. You eat out of the container and everything is glommed together. Yuch! The quesadillas were not baked and crispy as normal. They were served in an uncooked tortilla, and not cut into pieces. There's no melted cheese, nor onions, just chicken.     The enchiladas were covered with a nasty watery gravy and the pico was dumped on top. The beans were straight out of a can and poured over the mess.     The tostada was a crispy fried corn tortilla with cheese and chicken, lettuce, and rice and black beans. It was difficult getting at the tostada under all the toppings. The flavor was OK    This place was crowded and the staff broke out in long noisy chants regularly. This place is all about Messy overpriced food, a stressful eating environment, and a long wait.       For less money and a perfect atmosphere, we dined on tasty gourmet food at P.F Changs the previous evening."}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews, but every time we come to this Cafe Rio it seems like the last 10 times the we've had horrible service. Tonight just really made me want to write this review. My husband went to buy us dinner and he ordered a salad and asked for them to put extra dressing in the bag. (He was getting it to-go.) However, he drove home and there was no dressing in the bag, whatsoever. So, he drove 20 minutes back to the restaurant to get the dressing and the restaurant doors were locked at 9:45pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm...Needless to say my husband was frustrated, so he knocked on the glass until he saw one of the workers. The worker then, raised his hands with an attitude and rudely yelled, \"we're closed.\" It's the terrible attitude/customer service that makes this a 1 star review. The food is great that's the only reason we come back. Yes, we understand mistakes happen, we are human but \"apologize, listen, empathize, offer a solution\" simple customer service."}
{"text":"Usually a great quick and easy stop, even when they are busy. Tonight was awful. Waited in line almost 20 minutes to place an order. There were only 3 people ahead of us. The workers kept disappearing into the back. Trash was overflowing. Chicken soup had almost no chicken. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have came to this cafe Rio location 5 times in the last month for salmon tacos, unfortunately 4 out of 5 times the haven't had salmon. So disappointed to drive 15 minutes to be told there is no salmon. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"This place was very average. I've had much better Mexican food and this reminded me a lot of a Chipotle, but maybe a step below. I'm not a fan and wont be back, there is much better Mexican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"There aren't many healthy dining choices on this side of town, so Cafe Rio is the only spot that I know of where you can have some control over the creation of your food.   Their salads are what I usually order, and they can be very filling depending on the ingredients you choose. Their tacos, not so great, but their quesadillas are cheesy and gooey.   Now, how about that service? I must have been going on the off-days when most Yelpers mentioned they've had horrendous experiences. Each time I've gone, the service was OK. During my last visit, the staff was unfocused and did a sloppy job. The lady taking my order seemed a bit frazzled and was missing steps in the ordering process. She was stressing over the shortage of tortillas and the time it was taking to make them, and she also forgot to include lettuce and other toppings to my platter.   The other server screwed up my boyfriend's order by adding pico de gallo to his salad after my boyfriend mentioned several times that he didn't want any. After our orders were completed, the server dropped them onto our tray and went back to talking to his coworker. It really frustrated me to have to go through all that and then pay at the end, and the food here isn't cheap.  Both food and service here are hit-or-miss. I can only hope that this location shapes up."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but it has fallen short lately. The food used to be full of flavor but now is almost bland. I noticed the change after they remodeled. Not sure if the staff is making short cuts on the recipes but it just does not taste the same. Last week I stood in line for over an hour because my brother was in town and he enjoys telling his wife he ate a \"salad\". I saw some Mesa firemen in line 4 people ahead of me and some nice people held my spot so I was able get out of line and pay for their meal. I then got back in line and it was another 10 minutes before it was my turn to order. Seriously only 4 people were in front of me! Too bad as this was my go to for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Finally - A Cafe Rio nearby! New location is awesome!  Love their fresh salmon salads with homemade tortillas & cilantro dressing...yummy!"}
{"text":"Not only is Cafe Rio over priced but this location gave me bad service enough to put a bad taste in my mouth from this location altogether. The first two people in line were fine, the third was terrible. She had the worst attitude while preparing our food. when I asked for a side of sauce she acknowledged my request then proceeded to help the next person behind me after she pushed our food down the line. I had to ask again as she was starting to help the next person. She gives me the colossal size of the side (which I didn't want because they are so over priced). We get to the end and two burritos are $23 and the lady rings me up for a large side even though I didn't want it but it's whatever at this point. The portions were small for how much it cost and the burrito was soupy. I can't stand the amount of lettuce they put on the side(instead of putting it in the burrito?) as if I am feeding a small herd of rabbits but I guess that's Cafe Rio's style. I get better portions going to Zaba's, Chipotle, and Qdoba all for a cheaper price too.  I'm probably never going back to Cafe Rio their food and prices are definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Line out the door but the service at this location was really slow today and none of the employees seemed to care about customer service and there was a stage Odor by the soda machine smelt like piss!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch there today. Great service. Chicken is great as is the key lime pie!"}
{"text":"The lack of consistency in the place kills me. I eat here almost every week. Sometime they're like lightning crankin out burritos like crazy. Last couple times I've almost lost my mind. I always happen to be there about an hour before they close. Stop running out of grilled chicken! Make more! I get it, you're gonna close in an hour. I don't care, make more grilled chicken. Don't have the entire staff cleaning up the place instead of helping the 10 people on line. You're going to lose more business with the people you're making unhappy by trying to scrape by the last hour then you will the couple of chicken breasts you might waste. I hate that I keep going there expecting the crap service most of the time. This would be a 1 star if this wasn't the case all the time."}
{"text":"Standards for the food have been raised. Son loves the pork burrito so we have been stopping there a lot."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am a regular at this location.  The last 5 times I visited location they were out of items at 7pm that they should not be such as corn tortillas, orchata, and tres leche desert to name a few.  So very disappointing.  Today however, my kids were disappointed as the rice they love was hard.  As we headed to the drink area I noticed the specialty drinks were AGAIN off.  I asked for assistance as orchata was the drink we wanted, the manager said she could make some which was nice, however in the mist of her making fresh orchata, another customer was redeeming his stamp card and the cashier was arguing with him about how many stamps he has and who can use his card(his friend with him apparently not allowed to use his card )loudly in front of my children.  As we waited for another 8 mins...finally I interrupted and asked for my drink, which was given and a free meal next visit...so overall experience again was disappointing, manager handled the other guy and myself accordingly, but the workers there seem very unhappy and unwilling to value returning customers.  This is the only location that seems to have these types of issues.  hopefully they turn around the customer service and have menu items in stock. #wheresthecustomerservicegone? #ijustwantcaferioback"}
{"text":"I have been to all the Cafe Rios in Vegas, this new location is BY FAR the most CUSTOMER FRIENDLY, freshest food, AND has all products on the menu even close to closing!! I will make the drive to this location every time!  THANK YOU to the friendly staff with great smiles and politeness you can't find in too many places today.  It's nice to served by people who get along and enjoy what they do.  Loyal customer from this day on!!"}
{"text":"Tried café rio for the first time this past Friday.  It took forever to get through their line.  My wife and I ordered burritos, by the time we got our food it was stone cold.  The cashier has no clue, lets the food sit there until its unedible and then you pay for cold food.  I think, if we got the food hot it would have been ok. but I'm not standing in line for a half an hour only to pay 20 dollars for two burritos, no drinks, no chips, no service and cold food.  forget about this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one day, the sign for Taco Tuesday, 1.95 tacos drew me in. I ordered a chicken taco and a pork barbacoa taco.  Both were very good, in fact, I will be back for the pork again and again.  I will say, the service needs work. The staff is not very personable and when I asked for a side of rice, I got half a scoop in a bowl.  Luckily we were not charged for the side of rice.  All in all, good food and clean place."}
{"text":"The best Mex food for sure IMO! The workers are super nice and work fast! The coconut shrimp tacos with the mango salsa are great but the barbacoa is the best thing ever! Extra cheese lol"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio! Their salads, that aren't really salads, are delicious. Definitely get the creamy cilantro dressing! All the store locations are good, but i always feel like they are a bit reserved on the meat portion and would like just a tiny bit more. Staff is friendly and this is one of the more efficient cafe rio locations, during their busy time."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to this cafe rio I have an issue, Every. Single. Time. I come once a week because well I love cafe rio and it's close to work, but the employees here are useless. Ordered food ahead of time to skip the line and waited so long I could've gotten my food TWICE by actually standing in the line. They can never keep their portions of meat the same, one week i get a good sizable portion and the next it's barely enough meat to feed a small child. Half their employees aren't even friendly, luckily some of those employees look like they've been fired or moved to a different shift. Idk but this place needs new procedures and new management."}
{"text":"Even at their busiest time the staff seems to be able to handle everything well and stay organized. Very friendly and good portions. The salad isn't really a \"salad\" but it is delicious and you should definitely get it! They have some pretty tasty Jamaica and horchata as well and small flan for dessert."}
{"text":"I got the two taco plate with green chili and steak tacos with Beans and rice.  I had them put cheddar cheese on the taco.  When I got home I bit into the taco and could immediately tell the cheese was bad due to the moldy taste.  The next morning I woke up with horrible nausea and have been sick since, I even had to leave work early.  I was speaking with a co-worker who told me she became sick twice after eating at Cafe Rio. I used to come here frequently; but I am quite disappointed in their food handling practices.  Unsure what happened to this place."}
{"text":"So the gf really wanted to try this place after a little over a week we finally found ourselves here. Long story short it did not live up to the anticipation and hype and we were both unsatisfied with both the service and the food. The staff was a pretty rude besides maybe one person who helped us. I understand trying to work fast but your job is still to provide quality service. The line servers and cashier had a ok bye demeanor like you were a bother to them. One worker was really nice and walked around with a smile. I asked her if she could fix one of the drink machines and she took care of it happily. As for the food it was nothing special what do ever. You make your own tortillas cool, the difference in taste wasn't that big of a difference. Might be because the sugar burrito I ordered (the sweet pork barbacoa). I love sweet food but the barbacoa burrito tasted like straight sugar. I had to drench the second half in hot sauce just to balance out the taste a little. The steak burrito was mediocre definitely not worth $9. We both had to eat our burritos with a knife and fork because one the burritos weren't rolled good and they were soggy. Idk about you but I hate a messy put together burrito. I'm not a chipotle guy but I would def go with chipotle over these guys. Won't be coming back here there's too many better options I wouldn't even suggest it just to try."}
{"text":"This location is new and clean. Restaurant opens at 10:30. Everything is fresh and they had a full functioning kitchen. We love the shredded chicken salad with the creamy cilantro dressing with rice and black beans. The line moves fast and everything is made to order. Friendly staff and the location is easy to access from the street. Parking lot not too bad"}
{"text":"I hate this place so much. I only come here because my coworkers like it. Every time we wait in line AT LEAST 30 minutes before we get our food. Every employee is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know how they can keep track of whose order is whose; I can't even follow my own plate. My food is always very wet and messy from not draining the meat juice which makes it harder to eat and enjoy. I don't know if every location is like this, but I now dislike all Cafe Rios. This restaurant would be much better off as a sit down place with waiters. That way I would expect a 30 minute wait for my food, instead of standing in line for it."}
{"text":"Just had the Green Chile Pork Tostado and it was AMAZING.  Not spicy but just enough kick to make it very favorful.  I will be getting this again.  Get it with the shredded lettuce and you have one great salad and getting the tostado is cheaper than getting the salad.  You get the same amount of food."}
{"text":"This place gets high ratings and I can see why.  The tacos are outstanding and the quality of all the ingredients is very high.  The problem is in the details. I ordered a pork enchilada and while it was very high quality there was hardly any pork in it.  The soda fountain has more than the normal selection of favors but the soda is flat.   Not sure if I recommend it or not."}
{"text":"What can you say, it's Cafe Rio! Everything was on point when I visited the day after opening. Smiling, friendly staff, food was good, just like other locations. Nice not to have to run over by Chandler or San Tan mall locations when the craving hits."}
{"text":"Yo,  so I ordered two taco combination plate. And the put like 0.068oz of meat. Wtf? Hell to the naw, either they have some magical shrinking beef, or they are stingy AF.  I know grilled steak is expensive. But that's why they charge more! Man, this restaurant is a disgrace to my culture...  My parents didn't hop the border illegally to just get made fun of like this...  Does Donald trump own this chain? It feels as though my wallet just got raped, and not roofie style like Bill Cosby...  Jeffrey Dahmer raw style."}
{"text":"kinda disappointing Mexican food to be honest.  nothing special, different, or memorable about this place... I can definitely relate to fellowing Phoenix-ans when they say, there isn't much good Mexican food available, which is surprising and disappointing.  i had a pork burrito, since their pork is \"award winning...\" leftovers have gone untouched in my fridge, and i probably won't eat them since i am not all too hip to revisit the sub-par cuisine... which is REALLY annoying actually considering that thing wasn't cheap AT ALL.  they ding you a $1 for sour cream, $1 for guac, and $1 for extra cheese.  gimme a break people, sheesh!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I went there late, about 20minutes before close... still got fresh food and great attitudes. Shout out to Zoe & Karen great customer service on a taco Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's only 3 minute drive for me. The food is great, I love it, except their rice sometimes isn't very fresh that it tastes sour hence the 4 star. The people are very friendly, it's such a joy to order food from. They close a bit earlier than I would like, other than that, I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Another one star for this place.  Who makes the customers in line wait 5+ minutes to put together an order for a pick up order?!  It would make more sense to cater to the customers in line waiting."}
{"text":"My brother and I love it here! The portions are huge and the sweet pork is to die for! They also have a lot of home made drinks. Their strawberry lemonade is amazing and I couldn't tell it was sugar free. Make sure you are very hungry when you do visit because I mean it when I say the portions are huge.   I ordered my usual of the sweet pork salad. It has rice, beans (your choice), sweet pork, and your choice of toppings. All in a tortilla bowl! Definitely something to try with extra of their guacamole ranch sauce."}
{"text":"I'm DONE with Cafe Rio! The last couple of times I have been to this restaurant, I have noticed a decline in many places. To start, I was in on Tuesday about 5:00. This place us being run by a bunch of children who are loud and unprofessional. There were at least eight employees standing around in the dining room and two employees smoking in front of the restaurant. It looked like a high school cafeteria. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL.  Next, I have watched the prices grow and the portion sizes shrink. What used to fill the container almost all the way, now barely fills half. Two burritos and a bag of chips comes to $25.00.   There are several other similar restaurants that are MUCH cheaper. Cafe Rio used to be much better than those places but NOT ANY MORE. To finish, after getting home and digging into our mini burritos, we found that they were full of CRUNCHY rice and the chips were totally stale.  I am DONE with this Cafe Rio! I wonder if the owner knows that their restaurant is being run into the ground."}
{"text":"The 3 star rating is a combo of a 4-5 star rating for the food and a 1-2 star rating for the staff... so great food but the staff are dumb as rocks. I'm not talking about polite and dumb either,  i mean dumb and have the audacity to have an attitude and get short with you when you're keeping things pretty simple.  This isn't for ALL of the staff but at least 4 or 5 of them. Just a tip,  your customers are more likely to overlook the fact that you're stupid if you're at least nice about it. Hopefully next time we come for the great food, we'll be dealing with a more competent and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually go to Sweet Poke, but decided to switch it up and try this place.  I really love the paint splatter decor. It's very colorful. That's primarily the reason we were drawn to check this place out.  They build your order as you pick the meat and fillings that you want. Their tortillas are made from scratch and the ingredients were pretty fresh. The service was pretty quick and the staff was friendly. I ordered a steak quesadilla and my husband ordered the chicken nachos. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't spectacular either. I think of this as an overpriced Chipotle, as you can get similar items at Chipotle for less.  That being said, their horchata is deliciously amazing. I would come here just for that. Their drink fountain bar is pretty cool - they have the generic soda drinks, as well as Mexican drinks (horchata, tamarind) and fresh fruit juices - but you also have the option to customize your drinks by adding flavor shots.  I don't know that I'll be back for their food, but I will definitely come when I'm craving an horchata."}
{"text":"This place is the worst place anyone could go too! Their food line is so gross! I mention to the guy with glasses that I've never been here if he could run though some stuff. He said to just look at the menu. so I randomly picked something. The workers were rude and unhelpful.   You can visibly see all the cross contamination here! When taking a piece of chicken out of the grill they never checked the temperate .. why? You may ask... because uncooked chicken causes SALMONELLA.  Overall, the restaurant looked dirty and unorganized! Nothing looked appetizing."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cafe Rio. Whenever I'm in the mood for some gringo-fied Mexican fast food this is my restaurant of choice. It's far superior to Chipotle, Baja Fresh, and the rest of the fast food joints in the same space. This location just opened up a few weeks ago in the same strip mall as Golden Spoon, Panda Express, and Albertson's off of Blue Diamond.  The food taste pretty much the same as other locations. Their pork does tend to be on the sweet side, so if that's a turn off for you you're going to hate all of their pork dishes. Tuesday's are my favorite days to come here because their coconut shrimp tacos w/ mango sauce are delicious!   The staff here is great. Don't be surprised if the guys in the back break out into a song and dance routine as you're ordering or eating. It makes for an entertaining and amusing experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's one of the best fast food places around. It is a little pricey but the food is good, especially the coconut shrimp tacos. The chips and queso are addictive. All the portions are big. This place beats Chipotle hands down."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! However, the staff at this location seem very rude. We waited about an hour in line which wasn't the problem, but when I ordered with the first man in the line he judged me for ordering a salmon quesadilla. Where have you been bro? It's not that uncommon. He wasn't hospitable or professional at all. He even proceeded to be rude to my friends and their kids. I understand it's busy, but you don't have to be a judgmental ass to your customers that actually enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday for dinner because of the promotion they were having. As usual there was a long line during the dinner hours so if you are in a rush, try to avoid going around 5-8 p.m. lol. I got the sweet pork burrito which was pretty good (it's my go to dish). The pork itself has a lot of flavor since it is drenched in sauce. If you are trying to be a little healthier they have a wheat tortilla option.  The portion is nice and they put the lettuce and pico de gallo outside of the burrito which was kind of weird at first. I usually get cilantro as well. It's worth trying this place out if you haven't been yet and are tired of going to Chipotle. I do have to say that their chips and guacamole pale in comparison to Chipotle in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"Food was barely warm which is a deal breaker for me. Flavor of food good and friendly staff. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Cafe Rio, my wife said I would love it and she was right! Lots of Mexican choices to choose from. It reminded me of a Chipotle and Rubio's combined. They make the food right in front of you and you pick what you want in your burrito, taco or quesadilla and side like rice, beans and guac. It was fast fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and love it.  The tortillas are fresh and employees are friendly.  I love the queso dip but be warned - some days it is crazy spicy and some days it is mellow.  I like watching my food be prepared so I know it is correct.  The rewards program has awesome discounts like triple points days and BOGOs."}
{"text":"So I love café rio but the one on Decatur and blue diamond is way better. Like the girl that was putting lettuce on my burrito had an attitude and I kinda was getting a negative vibe. And they ran out of queso. My experience was bad and they had an attitude the whole time, it wasn't even busy for them to be so stressed out. On top of that their horchata was in the mint limeade container. That's contamination. The condiment bar/ soda fountain was disgusting, it seemed like there was no management running the store."}
{"text":"Always quick, good food, friendly service. Only downfall is the location. More addicting than Chipolte."}
{"text":"Simply awful.   We tried this Chipotle-style fast food joint today for the first time and it was so bad, I feel compelled to write about it immediately.  Upon first view, everything looked so promising....a long line, the homemade tortillas, fresh looking ingredients, smiling workers....but it all fell apart once we received our orders and tried the food.  My wife had a chicken quesadilla and it was one hot mess.  Greasy, gooey, sloppy and disgusting. She took two bites, probably one bite more than the quesadilla deserved, and gave up.   My cheese enchilada with medium spice sauce was even worse; the sauce was extremely salty and had a very unusual, awful taste that made the enchilada inedible. I had one bite and stopped eating.   The accompanying pico de gallo and shredded lettuce with each dish was pretty good!!   The Diet Coke and Barqs root beer were also good.  The self-serve drink station was a mess however, with piles of overflow ice and overflow soda all over the counter and floor. I always view this drink station mess, just atrocious housekeeping, which you see in a lot of fast food restaurants, as a sure sign of a poorly managed food establishment.  The Manager should be canned for allowing such a hygiene and health hazard in the restaurant.   I am amazed that Zagat rates Rio Cafe so highly.  It's one of the worst places I've eaten in Las Vegas.   I recommend you do not try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered online, waited 15 minutes past the promised pick up time when the place was nearly empty. They just forgot to make my food. The food was good but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I rather go out of my way and go to the one on blue diamond. The service is horrible here. The employees argue in front of each other and if you do online ordering it's always wrong, they're a mess there."}
{"text":"Ordered for an event our company was sponsoring!!  Let me say this is the 2nd time that they have been late. This time I told them 11:15 in hopes that they would be ready to eat by 11:45am when in reality it was Noon.  Needless to say Food didn't show up until 12:05pm  it was only 1 guy with food for 100 people and he had no cart to carry the food in and had no sense of urgency. We spent a little over 1k and expect the food to be on time, hot and if they happen to be running late at least a sense of urgency.  The food is great, but don't order from them for large parties especially if you don't want to look bad. Very dissapointed !!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I give this restaurant multiple chances everytime I go here the meal is messed-up I ordered a simple steak salad no rice no beans shredded lettuce and I quite honestly got everything but what I ordered this salad has sour cream when does a salad come with sour cream i called the store and the manager is too busy to talk to you"}
{"text":"Omg...didn't expect what I got...guava and chips, burrito, and coconut flan was amazing! Lemonade and teas were amazing! Customer care was excellent and friendly. I never yelp anyone but I took the time for this one I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"The burritos enchilada style are to die for!!! My favorite place to eat!! Yum! Their quesadilla with chicken is also very good! Fresh guacamole made daily is delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite place by far!! I used to eat their burritos all the time!! Now that I am on a diet  I still come here for their amazing salads!! Sign me up for a grilled steak or salon tostada any day!!!! Icome here at least once a week!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! As close as it's gonna get to authentic mexican food! Tortillas are hand made and everything taste delish!"}
{"text":"Ummmm I usually don't Yelp cafe rios because it's just an easy food place and there's really no problem (I've worked at fast food chains so I know there will always be minimal mistakes made here and there but it never matters? Cuz you just get your food and go lol) but this location um wow. They're taking orders like criss cross. The person taking my order is the person infront of the person behind me in line. And the one who should be taking my order is talking to the person behind me and behind that person in line. Lol this sounds confusing, but imagine it actually happening. Even more confusing in person!   They literally keep messing up and they look at you like you're stupid if you tell them what they missed. Hopefully they train their employees to be more organized."}
{"text":"Great food awesome services  Every time I go there there is AWAYS a welcome smile.recommend to dine there food is very fresh and taste delicious."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I go every Tuesday for the $1.5 pork tacos. Great service, employees know me by name. Love the porkkkkkkkk!"}
{"text":"We have been here on a couple occasions, not bad food, and service. But that changed last night. My wife and I had a late flight in from our vacation, and we were hungry. Being a Saturday night I looked up the hours for this store, and showed open til 11pm. So we hurried from the airport to find the doors locked at exactly 10:40. Knocked on door and not a single employee acknowledged. Knocked harder and few employees looked at us but still ignored us. So what is to be said? Never consider going there late, because you won't be sure they are open? Yep! And hey I get it... if its slow and you want to get out early, but then don't advertise hours of operation. And I'm a customer service guy, if can't walk your butt over to the locked door and apologize for the inconvenience, you won't see me there again!"}
{"text":"I've given this location multiple chances before writing this review, tonight was their third and last chance. The customer service is awful, they're overpriced, and the food is just okay. The three times I've been there I've always felt rushed when ordering. They always assume they know what meat I want and never give you a chance to let them know what sauce or cheese you'd like on your smothered burrito. It's an experience that I will never spend $14 on again.   Might I add that they all join in on a not so pleasant song when you order double meat. Are you serious?! You're going to put your customers on blast for ordering more meat? Why not sing a song about extra veggies so your customers would think you're supporting healthier lifestyle choices. Don't get me wrong, extra meat is delicious, but is the singing necessary? They're not fooling anyone that they're jolly let alone that they like their jobs.   If this review doesn't convince you not to waste your time visiting this location, at least try their horchata; the only consistently good thing about this place."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Americanized Mexican food.  Not the quickest place, but still considered fast food.  Food quality is good.  A lot nicer now they expanded and remodeled.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been in here a few times since they have opened, the food is good and I love their tortillas unfortunately their service still has not gotten any better. I waited almost 30 mins in line last night. Unless they can figure out how to make their line more efficient and it runs smoother and faster I can't see this getting any better. No one knows what they are supposed to be doing and the entire line is so discombobulated you end up having to shout over people. I don't think I will be back in."}
{"text":"Crummy service today. Disappointing because of their bad attitudes. Ordered a Nino quesadilla and a paid kids meal. Girl slammed down the food and even the guy behind me commented on it. Then I ordered the special and the girl said it would be 5 mins. I said I would wait then she sighed and said more like 10 mins co said fine I'll wait then she said 15. I was in disbelief. Then when I said never mind she rolled her eyes and walked away. At the pay counter my wife asked for the beans and soda that come with the paid kids meal and she just stared at us. Finally she slammed the chips on the land and the beans. I was already giving them a second chance after the horrible experience we had before. No more. We are done with them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Gilbert Taqueria. Yes, I know it's a chain but it's just sooo good! Great burros, quesadillas, salads, Mexican pasta you name it!   The burrito's are HUGE, expect to take home leftovers, I often can make three meals out of just one burrito! My favorite being the carne asada with black beans served enchilada style with melted cheese as salsa verde!   The salads are also very big! Served in a giant plate, with lots of lettuce, your choice of meat, cheese, beans, salsa ect. How can you go wrong?   The queso dip is very good but you need a minimum of 2-3 people to justify ordering that much queso.   What would a Mexican meal be without dessert? I love flan and this is probably my favorite place to get it! They have two kinds a chocolate flan covered with strawberries and a coconut flan. Both are wonderful! When I'm in town I live to swing by just to grab a dessert!"}
{"text":"Alright, let me start by saying that none of what I'm about to tell you has anything to do with Cafe Rio as a company. I absolutely love their food. However, at the 9th St and Bell Rd store, the staff is unbelievably rude, and their practices don't match the other Cafe Rios that I have been to.  Let's start off by saying that I feel like I'm receiving attitude every single time I walk in the door. I ask for grilled chicken and I get a sneer \"That'll be extra\" Yeah, okay fine. I'll pay the extra dollar, no need for that look on your face.  I ask to swap out the guacamole with the house dressing. \"That will be extra you know.\" Uhm, okay, why? If I'm already paying for the guac that comes with it, why do I have to pay to swap it out with something else? I know for a fact that to make the guacamole is more expensive to make than the house dressing. Just saying.  Today, my mother and I used a coupon for a buy one salad or burrito and get one free. I thought by the looks on the staff's faces that they were all going to get an aneurysm. To top that all off, we then pulled out a coupon for free chips and salsa. The red sauce definitely hit the fan with that one. \"You cannot use two coupons at one time.\" Can you feel the look of hatred just from that sentence? Because I can, dang. Yes, okay, we understand. However, it says right here on the chips and salsa coupon that no purchase is necessary. \"Well you can't use two coupons at once.\" Uh huh, we get that. There's two of us. I'll use one coupon, my mom can use the second? By the looks on their faces, you would have thought I had just reached my hand over the glass and fingered the sour cream. Great, yes, we get our chips and salsa. Get to the cashier, and the whole thing starts again with the person ringing us up. Face palms start now. Then, who I'm guessing was a manager, decides to snip off and tell us, with a sarcastic little giggle, might I add \"Well we can't use another coupon with one that says 'no other coupons can be used with this coupon.' So we'll just say that since there's two of you, each of you is using a different coupon.\" She says this with the largest fake smile she could muster. I've worked in retail and the food industry lady, I can smell your fake attitude from across the room. To make matters worse, they tried to charge me for sour cream on a burrito... Shouldn't a burrito come with sour cream. Just saying. All and all here, I would recommend going to the Cafe Rio on Tatum and Cactus by the Chick Fil A, because they are sooo much more respectful, and you don't feel like you're being judged for the food you're ordering. Trust me, drive the few extra miles."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite fast food Mexican restaurants. However, it's almost always crowded and the line moves SUPER SLOW.   The food is amazing. I love their salads -- try it with hot enchilada sauce instead of ranch. It'll cut back the calories.   All of the tortillas are home made. I think they're some of the best, personally.   During the colder months I prefer the soup with shredded chicken. It's very good.   We've done takeout quite a few times. They almost always mess up our order so that's not worth it. We get home and everyone's meals are messed up or condiments are forgotten. Just go through the line instead to save yourself.   I give it 3 stars. If the line movement and takeout service improves, I'm at 5 stars really quick."}
{"text":"Probably the most honest burrito I've ever had. NO, really!!!  Don't know how this ties in with the Olympics, though. Didn't really see any decor for the 2016 Olympics. A+ 'rito still tho lol."}
{"text":"We got there tonight at 10:15 when it closes at 11.  Felt like we horribly inconvenienced the workers who had pretty much everything put away.  Couldn't see over the separation thingy and had to scream to get my order through and apparently she couldn't hear me still cause it got made wrong.   I said it was wrong and she asked if i wanted it remade.. i don't want to waste food so no.. but it was less than awesome.  They were out of many things including guacamole and offered sour cream instead.  The guac is my favorite part but they did manage to throw me a little bit.  The chicken tasted old and spongy.  The oven obviously wasn't hot cause both of our enchilada style burritos had cheese that wasn't melted and the inside was also only warm.  The one upside was my burrito was huge!!  They seemed so annoyed when we wanted to dine in and even worse when they had to find us a fork.  Table was wobbly too.  Girls restroom was locked..  really bad experience.  I want my 24 bucks back."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  They always make my burrito right and service is fine.  The burritos can get a little pricey with all the additions but I usually split it into two meals so it's ok.  My only gripe is their guacamole scoop is sooo tiny for a dollar extra."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner tonight around 7pm and it was dead. If you come here during the week at dinner times it's crazy busy. They were out of a few items I wanted tonight, queso and medium sauce so I was bummed about that. I ended up getting a sweet pork burrito enchilada style with mild sauce. It was really good. I love that they put it through the toaster so it's hot and steamy and their tortillas are made fresh and incredible. The sweet pork is like nothing else, so much flavor and very juicy. I would recommend and will be back again for the sweet pork."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has to have the best chicken burritos there! Everything is so fresh and full of flavor! I get me burrito enchilada style and I definitely recommend that. Everything is fresh and made by hand, like their flour and corn tortillas. Definitely one of my fave places!..:)"}
{"text":"Manager very rude on first responders! The only cafe rio where a manager treats you so bad. Restaurant is always dirty."}
{"text":"Love cafe rio! It is kind of like chipotle, except good. The barbacoa is where it is at. I always go for the enchiladas with hot sauce. I don't care too much for their beans, but the rice is great as well. They do fresh tortillas on the grill. I always grab an extra one as they are too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Came here as soon as it opened and the crowds soon followed. I love the enchilada style burritos. I have tried several meats and they were all good. I enjoyed the sweet pork the most and add cilantro after the journey through the oven. Popular for lunch and the line is long at times so beware."}
{"text":"As far as fast food Mexican joints go, Cafe Rio is pretty good. Portions are very generous, and I like that their tortillas are made freshly throughout the day.  Haven't tried other offerings yet, because we almost always go for the burritos. Skip the boring chicken and go for the Pork Barbacoa or the Chile Roasted Beef. They're both very tasty options. Also, enchilada style(AKA wet burrito) is the way to go, topped with salsa verde and cheese. Drink selections there are plentiful too.  Beware of other extras and add-ons though, or you could end up with a pricey meal! If you just HAVE TO get your sour cream, pico, or their addicting house dressing,(AKA Salsa Verde mixed with Ranch) they are big enough to share. Will probably try one of their huge salads next time if I can get myself to take a break from their burritos!....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in an outdoor mall, you might miss this.  It's a decent place for Mexican \"light\" fare. Best part are the drinks, like hibiscus lemonade.  The salmon salad is quite good and filling.  The burritos and quesadillas are a safe bet.  Everything is more or less made in front of you.  The biggest problem is the ordering process seems pretty inefficient, and the kids who work here seem even less apathetic than is natural. A bit higher in cost than you might expect."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab a bite. They are a bit chaotic in terms of service, but the food is fine.  Typical Mexican fare, not super authentic.  You order cafeteria style, then go to your table, or take out.  Lots of teenaged workers with literally no clue, but whatevs."}
{"text":"New location off Durango and 215. The food was pretty good but the service was mediocre. Yes, I'm aware that they are fairly new but it was very disorganized. At one point me and the lady in line behind us didn't know who should pay the cashier first because some of our order was ready yet some was not and no one was advising us what to do. Awkwardness. Also some of the employees weren't very friendly. When my husband asked for green salsa for our chips and salsa she gave him a bad look and seemed annoyed that she had to go to the green salsa toward the end of the line versus the red salsa in front of her. We didn't appreciate the attitude.   Now for the food. The tortillas were hot and fresh and so were the chips. The steak was a little tough and dry but I did enjoy the chile roast beef. It was super tender, juicy and flavorful. They should've drained it a little better before putting it in the taco though because my taco was drenched, dripping and a little soggy from the juice. The tacos came with rice and beans. The rice was good but the black beans lacked flavor.   Overall, the food was pretty good but the service was a turn off. I would like to go back and try some of the other meat choices on the menu. Maybe with a little more time service will be a little better. Maybe they're just working out the kinks of a new location."}
{"text":"Dirty kitchen, dirty dining area. Burnt chicken.  The last two time I've eaten at this location I've gotten FOOD POISONING.  Go to the centennial location instead."}
{"text":"Well this is a disappointment for me to write. I've been 3 times since I wrote my first review and each time they have served \"slop\" !!!!!! From the tacos, to the enchiladas and even the salads. They just slop the ingredients into the plate and serve it up! It's gross now!!!!"}
{"text":"Someone please compliment the person who made the house ranch sauce today!!! It's more than perfect with my grilled chicken salad! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Food is still good, but the service/experience is on a sharp decline... 12:20 in the afternoon, we are out of salmon for the day...  Throwing/tossing rice and beans and whatever on my place. I am not an animal on a farm. respect the food that i am about to put in my body!  I will most likely be getting my salads from Cafe Zupas from now on anyway..."}
{"text":"This review is more about the service than the food. The food I would give 4 stars. The service is shockingly bad. First of all,? they don't wear name badges and I see why. Yesterday 5/17/18, the girl making my food was clearly miserable. She actually was throwing things around. I was shocked the manager didn't? pull her off the front line! Is it that hard to get people with customer service skills and work ethics? I refuse to give my hard earned dollars to a business? that tolerates rudeness? to customers!"}
{"text":"There's this extremely rude girl who doesn't wanna do a little extra for the customer lol.   I asked for a sample of the meat and she just rolled her eyes. And then when I ordered 1 taco and asked for the lettuce and beans to be put on the side she literally shook her head talked underneath her breath. Haha I can't.   I mean it's not like I asked for anything too extensive and out of the way. So idk.   Plus, I was so nice to her. I was smiling and everything not even giving her an attitude. So I just laughed it off.   Other than that my boyfriends family and I come here fairly often because they have good food.   Smh, train these employees with respect."}
{"text":"Showed up an hour before they closed and the food was obviously old- they wouldn't offer me the sauce I wanted because they already put a lid on it. The rice was crunchy and my steak burrito tasted like fish. Super disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio! The house dressing is what always keeps me coming back. This location has some really nice and friendly employees that are always happy to help!"}
{"text":"This cafe rio is a complete mess. This is a franchise, yet their standards are so low. All the workers slowly walk around the back and have no urgency. I waited around 20 minutes for my food, while about 3 workers mindlessly waked around the back. The last time I was here, they were out of pork. This time, I waited a long amount of time for them to make pico de gallo. While this was supposed to be happening, I saw several workers snacking on chips in the back. Currently, I'm standing here waiting for my chips to be done. If I ever eat Café Rio again, I will definitely not be coming back to this location. It is absolutely disgusting to see the workers snacking on the food that they are serving and preparing. It is also insanely unprofessional."}
{"text":"For me, Cafe Rio is a good, quick Mexican food fix. The saving grace for this place is it's fantastic queso dip. Today we had the green chili chicken enchiladas, Barbacoa tacos and nino quesadillas. We really like that the kids quesadillas are free. But MAN that queso dip is good."}
{"text":"First off, we walk in on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm and 2 of the employees (the food prep and cashier) we're playing frisbee with one of the tins. Second, after being checked out, they're out of forks and all the big tables are dirty which tells me they've spent all afternoon goofing off like a bunch of children instead of actually working.  Food is good and service was quick but professionalism and upkeep are in the toilet. We decided to give this place a second chance because last time we came, there was vomit in the customer line and nobody in a rush to clean it up. This visit was only slightly better than seeing vomit right before ordering our food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to be a huge fan of chipotle but I feel like every time I go they make their burritos smaller. This place has a huge burrito and I get mine enchilada style (smothered) which since it has barbacoa comes out to 8.25. I love to get tortilla strings on the side so they add some crunch when I need it. They have a delicious house dressing that is beyond amazing. I like to add that inside my burrito even though sometimes they stare at me for my choice but hey it's absolutely delicious. Homemade tortillas that you can see them make in front of you if you during prime hours. Fresh delicious ingredients. Don't be afraid to mix sauces and ask for extra cheese."}
{"text":"The food here is really great but the cleanliness and atmosphere need A LOT of work. I ordered 6 \"plain\" steak tacos for my children and I noticed right away that they put cheese on them (which we specifically said we didn't want). I brought it to their attention and the guy behind the counter totally GLARED at me and then started yelling at me and his co-worker in Spanish. Even though we were there at 7:00pm, well after the dinner rush, the grill and stations were completely covered in random food bits and sauces and were, overall, pretty gross and unsanitary. The drink/condiment stations weren't much better. The entire area was sticky and covered in wrappers, covers, napkins and garbage. There wasn't ONE clean table in the whole restaurant, the floors were disgusting and the garbages were overflowing with food and containers. We decided to just eat outside at the restaurant next door and prayed that we didn't get any food poisoning as a result of how gross the food prep area was. Please do a better job of cleaning your restaurant so we can come back for the delicious food"}
{"text":"I don't understand how the employees can look like they hate their job here.  They rush you so fast before I could speak on what I wanted on my burrito Then after eating halfway., something of a bad crunch was in it.. (like it was on the ground at one point )   Not cool & not sanitary!!  Plus the RICE was NOT cooked all the way!!  Here's a lil advice- cook it right or don't cook it at all!!!"}
{"text":"New manager, same problems since opening.    Asked for nachos with cheese and chicken.  First person in line rudely says there are no nachos so move down the line and we will get you some nachos.  Second person in line, the manager trying to keep things together, he takes control but I still end up am waiting for 15 minutes in the dining room.  He finally gets my nachos, melts the cheese and adds the chicken, then passes it down the line to a final third server.  The third server gets yelled at to get my nachos done and he picks up someone else's cheese only nachos and asks me what I want on them.  No one in the line has any idea what is going on in this restaurant, blind leading the blind.  I correct his mistake because I am watching for a switch.  I then ask him to \"add pico,\" and he adds pinto beans.  I can't start over so I take the order the way it is and leave.  Total time from entry to exit is 45 minutes and there were only a few people in line!  What can I say the place is poorly managed, it has been since it opened and it still is to this day.  Better watch your food in this place because they don't have a clue."}
{"text":"Friendly staff behind the counter. Sweet Park Burrito is very big. Meat is high quality. Not filled with fat or gristle. Cheese actually tastes cheesy. Fresh tortillas are excellent.   Lost a star for not having any Splenda (I asked). How am I supposed to drink ice tea without Splenda. The pink stuff is awful"}
{"text":"Excellent service and Excellent Fresh Tasting Food. I love this place in Lakewood CA, and was hopeful that it would be the same. My mom and I shared a Huge Chicken/Carne Nachos and Mm Mm Mmm were they delicious! We'll be back to this location for sure!"}
{"text":"I work in the food industry and I know how postmates can be but the fact that I've ordered from y'all close to a dozen times and you have got my order right maybe twice is disgusting and on top of that some of your employees are horrible worst attitudes I've ever seen"}
{"text":"The taco salad was by far the biggest and freshest cuts from the steak and vegetables cuts! Love the freshly made flour tortillas and the mint lemonade is unique and never tasted before !"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my family and probably not going to come back here again because the service was not very good. Took a little longer for them to make our food even though the restaurant was dead and there was no one behind us in line. They were more worried of restocking and preparing than making our food. The cashier did not charge us for extra stuff but usually come here every once in a while and the service was great but today I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Insane how this is the only location I've been to that doesn't prepare the salads bowls the same as the rest - I will never go back. No wonder the place was a ghost town at noon on a Friday. The employees seemed angry I was even there. Just terrible."}
{"text":"While the food is excellent the personnel are poorly trained and fail to provide even the rudimentary semblance of customer service.   That said, the food is well made, fresh, and a great improvement over their competitors. I recommend their salads.   Perhaps management will focus on teaching the staff customer service skills."}
{"text":"I like Cafe rio food,  This restaurant is a mess, and the food is terrible.  Whomever is managing this location needs to get it together.  Please, so I can go there again.   Thanks"}
{"text":"Love the fresh food, employees are great. Price is right!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick take out dinner here last weekend. We were in and out in about 15 minutes. I ordered the chicken burrito enchilada style with pico, black beans and cilantro lime rice. The flavors were consistent and the burrito filling. My sister ordered the steak salad. It's her go to and she also enjoyed her food. This is the closest Cafe Rio to my sisters home and we love to grab a bite here when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't come here late, they had nothing put pork, the girl in the front trying to get my attention needs to learn how to talk to customers"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, overpriced!! $15 for a burrito and drink. What restaurant charges extra for \"grilling\" the meat???? These guys do"}
{"text":"We have been customers for many years at the flagship in Provo. The Best Las Vegas rio is on eastern. We live on west side of town and gave up on the Sahara local. Slow, dirty and really don't care at all. We started going to Lake Mead store. It is cleaner. But the service is poor. Today we had a lady making our meal that seemed annoyed with me for asking a few questions about getting a plain cheese quesadilla. $8.75 seems a bit stiff. She returns from the register to check price ala carte which was only .50 less. She began making a salad for me and I asked her to please change her gloves from touching register. Now she's really annoyed.  They used to give me 1/2 of two meats. Now they charge double meat. Also any extra sauce on a salad is additional. When did they get so scotch?? Used to like to go there. Think it's overpriced and and always poor service. Never have seen a manager on site that seemed to care. It's just not the same"}
{"text":"We have eaten at cafe rio in Utah for years. This location is a huge let down. Poor customer service , slow long lines and inconsistent food quality. No management on site to oversee quality control.  It is also dirty and I see employees with atrocious and unappetizing food handling !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The employees are always nice and the restaurant is always CLEAN! I recently tried the new spicy habanero sauce and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a physician who spent 70+$ (9 meals) on meals for the staff at Saint Rose hospital in the emergency room on 6-4-16 at 11:50 for pick up at 12. My medical scribe, on her way back to the hospital from pick up, spilled one of the salads.  I called the restaurant and asked if it were possible to get the salad remade because it was mine; we have the receipt.   The \"manager\" on the phone rudely informed me in what was barely English that there was no way the salad could be remade despite the fact that this was right after one person put 9 meals on her car! They did not help her out the meals in the car or give her any kind of box to hold the food despite the fact that they f******* cater. Also, the rest of the food did not come with any silver ware or napkins. They pushed off this inconvenience to the poor scribe who had to pick the food up.  Disgusting treatment and lack of self awareness from this location. Our ER will be going to chipotle from here on out. You all have been warned.  By the way this was a vegan salad with NO MEAT OR SUBSTITUTE. How cheap. I hope the manager gets chewed out. Unbelievable. And I didn't even get to how crappy the meals were thrown together."}
{"text":"The food tastes good, but they don't have the Chipotle system down. They messed up my order, which I couldn't see until I started eating it. My husband's burrito wasn't hot. While we were in line another customer asked for cheese because it had been left off their soup. They also don't have a good system for keeping orders with the right people. But the worst part for me was the gentleman who appeared to be the manager. At each request to fix something, he stopped and looked directly at the person making the request as if he was judging them for not just taking what they were given.   On the plus side, a very nice man was initially taking orders, offering samples of the meats and trying to do his part. And, as I said, the flavors were quite good."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Can't best the best tortillas in town..  But the service of the workers the is just terrible.  McDonald's higher better talent and they serve 99c burgers.   For 11 dollar burritos I would expect at least competent employees.    Save your breath and go to Chipotle"}
{"text":"I feel like this cafe rio is getting a bad rap for no reason! I drive 5 extra minutes to go to this one instead of the one on Sahara for several reasons. 1. It was super clean, one of the cleanest cafe rios I have even been in. The workers are okay at customer service, but at least they can do their job. The one on Sahara has messed up my order several times, dropped my food on the floor than was mad she had to remake it, and I've waited in line for over 30 minutes. Never waited in line here over 5 minutes. Overall it's a yummy quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I finally gave this place a try, and while I haven't quite made up my mind about it, I will say this: the food is good.  I didn't love my experience here, to be honest. The food is terribly overpriced, about 9 dollars and change if you set your burrito up with everything chipotle offers at around $8.  That wouldn't be so bad, but the lady making my burrito rolled it up long before I was done telling her what I wanted on it. I guess they put their pico de gallo, lettuce and other veggies on the side, which is ok but I would have liked the choice to have it in my burrito.  With only meat, beans, cheese, salsa, and a little rice inside, the burrito was near impossible to pick up without collapsing and spilling out large amounts of messy filling. I'd recommend ordering your burrito enchilada style with sauce and cheese on top since you will be eating it with a fork and knife no matter what.  I hope I don't sound like a grump, I did enjoy much of my meal.  The tortillas are fantastic. They are handmade, hot, fluffy, surprisingly flavorful. I'd get another sloppy burrito just to experience that tortilla again.  I ordered the Barbacoa since I had heard such great things about it, but I did not enjoy it. It was very sweet, which is fine in most BBQ, but this didn't seem to have any outstanding flavor besides overwhelming sweetness. Im more of a spicy kinda guy so I think this was probably just a bad choice for me, though I think there could have been more smokiness to the meat. Next time I will try it with steak or grilled chicken.  What I really need to tell you about is their chips, salsa, and queso dip. You must order these items. I know cafe rio is expensive, but it is absolutely necessary that you add this to your order. The chips are decent enough, but the salsa is great.. Probably the best I've had in Vegas so far. I didn't care for the salsa they put on my burrito but this one was delicious. The queso was awesome. Not the best I've ever had but definitely better than anything else I've had in town, and certainly a must have from cafe rio.  There is a pretty terrific collection of bottled hot sauces to add to your food if you're like me and enjoy a little food with your hot sauce.   I thought the staff was friendly enough, the dining room was clean and orderly.  Despite my many gripes with this place, there is a lot to like and I think it's definitely worth returning to."}
{"text":"The salad! It's just so good with the creamy dressing and fresh tortilla. I've been here a number of times and have always had a great experience. The employees are friendly even just before closing time and I love the decor. Yay cafe rio!!"}
{"text":"So, my review is really for this location and the service, as opposed to the food.  I have been to a few Cafe Rios around town and this one always seems to have rude service.  Finally got sick of it the other day, so I'm writing this review!  God bless Yelp.  First thing's first: I love Cafe Rio food.  Their salads are like little (or huge, actually) bowls of heaven.  I could eat them all the time.  BUT, the service here almost makes me want to stop coming.  They are always SO busy and hectic, and the staff tries to be as fast as possible (a good thing) but at the expense of quality service (a bad thing).  They end up rushing you through the line and they get pissed when you ask a question or take one second to decide.  If you are trying something new, forget about it.  They're going to be mad.  The last time we went was a couple days ago, and when we left, we were like \"man, they seemed even ruder than normal!\"  It's not cool.  I totally understand the need for speed, but it's not okay to be a jerk to a customer.  CALM DOWN, Cafe Rio staff.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Too much cheese...on the tortillas, the salad, the guac. Hard to understand the servers' thick accents. It will take you a few visits to figure out how to order the way you want it. Good food. Fast service."}
{"text":"Starting off if you hate your job that's fine and all. At work atleast smile fake but smile. Im a big fan of Cafe Rio but this eastern location they were kind of rude , and they were very disorganized. The cashier was lost, i asked for a tres leches cake and she did not even know how to plate it!!! REALLY!!!! She would ask the other staff members and they looked lost!!! Wow never coming back!!!  Please retrain THANK YOU"}
{"text":"I only yelp if it's really bad, and this was exceptionally bad. Cold, super vinegary, and undercooked rice with a side of watery brown guacamole (which I paid extra for). I ordered a burrito enchilada style. When I asked for pico in my burrito they said they don't do that since they put it through a heater.....whaaa? It's pico...not like it's going to disintegrate in heat, and you should probably just do what the customers want. I then was disappointed when she asked me \"hot, medium or mild\", I replied mild and got a crap ton of green tomatillo sauce all over the inside and outside of the burrito which only tasted like vinegar. How can you not have a mild red enchilada sauce and give customers a choice???   The slightly rude manager did give me my money back. Why is this place so hyped????   If you like crunchy weird rice and vinegar, this will be your spot!"}
{"text":"I've visited Cafe Rio before, but this Cafe Rio must be, by far, one of the worst when it comes to customer service. Bad enough to force me to create a Yelp account, and provide a negative review. I visited this location with my friends and when we started ordering, right off the bat, the service was slow and shitty. The employees seemed very unhappy, and hostile, towards the customer. It made me feel uncomfortable and not want to order, but giving that my friends and I had already spend 30 minutes in line, I was not about to just walk away. While ordering the new employees had no idea what was going on, like even the names of the meat. I don't blame the new employees for not knowing because they were new, but the older employees were completely useless and unwilling to provide help or guidance, awkward. As I was ordering extra cheese, or a different cheese, and the new employee was ready to get it for me, the older employee asked very rudely, \"is he going to pay extra?!?!\" And it was just very rude and could have been asked completely differently.   The food was okay. I have nothing to say about the taste, because they obviously used the same ingredients. However, the customer service did ruin my experience there. I hope management does something about the hostile customer service this location is providing."}
{"text":"I called to confirm they had salmon on my way to this location and within minutes from when I called and arrived they had none for the evening. Very disappointed as I specifically called before getting all the way there since I only eat fish. I dine here very often and I usually have a raving review for them but this is the 2nd time this has happened at this location."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the experience picking it up was not. I came in to pick up lunch for my family and every single employee down the line of getting the meals prepared had an unfriendly attitude and demeanor about them. Not only that, but they forget to put two sides I ordered in my bag upon checking out.  It's unfortunate, because I have enjoyed Cafe Rio at other locations before, but I probably have no intention of visiting this one again."}
{"text":"Extremely busy during the lunch hour! The staff is great but when it's that busy they're definitely impersonal with costumers. I went around 12:30pm on a weekday and there was about a 15 minute wait to get through the line. I personally prefer that they don't ask what i want when i'm not to the front ordering area yet but they do so to keep the line ahead of its pace. There seemed to be about 4 people waiting at the end for to go orders crowded around the register.  I'll also add that I was not impressed with the cardboard sign stating \"sorry, out of knives.\" Otherwise the food quality is always good and seems to be quite clean every time i've gone in there."}
{"text":"i love cafe rio and have had more good experiences at this location than bad. I've ordered from both the app and from dining in. The line definitely gets long and the organization of the phone and ringing up at the register is poorly managed but other than that the employee's have always been pleasant, i've only felt gypped once at this location with the quac and salmon, and the line seems to move pretty steadily. The rest of the restaurant though gets over looked when it's busy. They run out utensils and the table aren't wiped down during those times, i've also seen them run out of ice multiple times which is very inconvenient. Again, over all compared to other locations, this one is good (minus the screaming kids)."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  They just fling spoonfuls of slop into an aluminum takeout container.  Everything lacked flavor.  The guac was disgusting!  Employees were not at all helpful or friendly.  I'll stick with Chipotle for assembly style mexican food.  It's 100 times better."}
{"text":"I normally eat at another Cafe Rio location and have always had a great experience and delicious food.  I wish I could say the same about coming here.  The people that work here lack smiles and I haven't encountered anyone nice here the few times I have been to this location.  Tonight's food was the worst.  We got 4 tacos.  The tortillas were so soggy I couldn't hold them in my hand.  The rice was undercooked and quite crunchy.  To top it off, the place was a mess behind the counter.  Cleanliness, friendliness and quality control go a long way."}
{"text":"Pork burrito enchilada style all the way! Also... their queso can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's by far the greatest value for money around UNLV campus. Try a tostada salad with chicken or pork and house dressing. If you want a lot of food try a steak salad and a one of their deserts.   Staff members are constantly rotating but overall are nice young guys. One of the managers looks unnecessary mean (a girl server said that she can't put more cheese on my plate because the manager will yell at her). Please, don't yell at them! I ate at your place literally over 100 times and my loyalty is worth more than this extra grain of rice. Please keep refilling your teas too."}
{"text":"The Friday Special: Salmon tacos with black beans, rice and a cold drink hit the spot today. This was my husband and my first visit as the restaurant is new and recently opened.  Their concept is similar to Chipotle.   Upon reaching the counter after looking over their menu, I placed my order. The friendly employees prepared the meal to my specifications.   (I ordered the black beans and rice on the side, and chips with salsa as it was National chips and salsa day).  They gave my husband a military discount too! Clean restaurant with friendly employees. Restrooms are clean as well.   Fresh ingredients and handmade flour tortillas. We enjoyed our meal. My husband ordered the shredded chili beef enchiladas with black beans and rice. He enjoyed every bite.  We didn't go away hungry, we left with full tummy's and a smile.   We will definitely be returning at a future date."}
{"text":"We came in the all 7 employees were bunched together talking. They didn't acknowledge us, the food was meh, they were all rude. Probably worth the drive to go the other one. The trash cans were all overflowing and the place was a mess. But they were too busy talking to each other to do their job."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, great Mexican rice, yummy pinto beans. Salsa very tasty. Beer needs to be a little colder."}
{"text":"Horrible! First appearance of where your food is prepared very messy and glass DIRTY, snotty kids making food! Second, Ordered a wet steak burrito and red sauce looked burned and old,  brown guacamole, and wilted lettuce! No exaggeration tempted to call Dirty dining.....  Then I got a vegetarian tostada with a half a head of lettuce! And I had asked her not to much! The last thing is that the person putting the lids on your food wears NO GLOVES!!!! GROSS!!!! Overall look of the dining area not clean!!! And rushing you where's the fire?! Won't be back and still tempted to call Dirty Dining!"}
{"text":"My office decided to give cafe rio a third try. We had comped meals from previous mistakes in our order. Our order was not correct once again. They forgot to add a few things we requested. Our nachos had like no cheese. So the side of queso we didn't receive was missed!! We won't dine here again."}
{"text":"The food is good and dependable. However, the lines at lunch time can be extreme. They do as good of a job as they can in moving the line forward but it can be slow for sure. Come earlier before the lunch rush or wait until later - tons of traffic from across the street at UNLV."}
{"text":"This franchise has great food but I've noticed in some of the locations there's always workers that half ass the food just because maybe they're lazy. Just hope you actually get the people that give you great service and hospitality other than that I love the burrito of course in enchilada style!!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but nothing good lasts forever. The manager is a joke, I asked if they weren't going to have any mint limeade, the best part of Cafe Rio and he apologized and said there was no excuse. That's it? No we'll make more, nothing. The place has gone down hill and the manager is the reason. Food quality and service quality are just terrible."}
{"text":"Love this place, the place is super clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. I order the burrito sweet pork with everything. It very good. I would definitely be back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant we at least eat here twice a week, but l usually go to the one on Sahara, today we were coose to this location so we wwnt to this location wich was a big mistake amd l am not coming back again. I order a salad wich is the especial of today and my son got a side of rice and one chicken taco. When l was eating l start reading the ticket and saw that they charged me for two tostadas so l went to the cashier and l told him l didn't have two tostadas it was one and one side of rice with one taco, he apologized and said oh sorry, then another guy came closer and tells me that they only owe me a few cents because l order that  a la carta or something like that so the taco was over $6.00 so my total with the taco and the side of rice was $7.35 l tought it was ridiculous to charge over $6.00 for one taco so l show him that the price for one taco was $3.00 something so he walked away and said that the orice was in the computer. So l ask him to wrote everything on a paper. It is ridiculous to charge that amount specially when l go there so often that l know what l pay every time. I think they should talk with the employees and thell them to be less rude with costumers and fix things the proper way.! I am attaching pics of what they charged me and the notes he made his name is Travis."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not sure if Cafe Rio is really an authentic Mexican cuisine or is it like one of those american tiki bars that are all dressed up like the islands, but actually resides smack dab in the middle of the US. Either way, if it is an American corporation that dresses like a mexican spot, call me one to turn the other cheek! I'm just in love with the food and flavor.  Coconut shrimp taco tuesdays. Thats what its all about. They are VERY generous about the shrimp too I may add. I also love the pork barbacoa tacos. The burritos are just too big for my hand to hold, so I opt for the tacos. I love the barbacoa flavor because its sweet, juicy, and meaty as well. The pork is tender and perfectly shredded. Its just so full of flavor, and has that nice marinated bbq taste to it. If you like more soft, and less over powering flavors, I'd try the coconut shrimp, salmon, and mahi mahi. Those are primo. It's not filling, the flavors are very soft and subtle, and the fish is tender as well.  But what makes everything perfect and my personal favorite is the torilla. It's freshly made, and because it trastes so wonderful I always ask to DOUBLE the tortilla. It's a thick tortilla and very soft. It has this light, sweet, doughy taste and texture to it. It's not flat and woodfired or stovetop grilled like most tortillas. Expect to see the cooks in the back making the dough and cooking the tortillas fresh for you. My favorite.  Also, they have a stamp card. But 9 meals, and get the tenth free. WHO DOESN'T LOVE STAMP CARDS?!?!!?!"}
{"text":"My experience here today was sub par to say the least.   This is my 3rd time eating here. My problem is not with cafe rio or their food but the girl who served us.   I'm very big on customer service and it was bad and made me mad enough to leave this.   I asked for a quesadilla meal. She moves on the the next person , my wife and says. \"What else. Doesn't ask me what kind of meat or \"did you want anything else but cheese on there\"  or anything. So not knowing how things work exactly I figured she'd ask me what kind of meat I wanted in a second.....Nope sure didn't. So I didn't get a chicken quesadilla like I wanted.   Not only that. There was a new trainee there. Who was standing there not knowing what to do and this girl is just throwing stuff around and not taking the time to show this girl anything! She asked her a questions \" hey how long are you supposed to put that in the warmer\" basically begging to be trained. And she blows off the question and goes and does something else.   I hate leaving bad reviews and this is my first one because I don't want to harm other businesses, but this girl needs to go!!"}
{"text":"I gave it two stars ONLY because their food tastes good. The establishment and the people running it deserve ZERO stars. I've never waited in line so long for food when the place isn't even busy. The past few visits I've experienced rude employee after rude employee. Today I stood ready to pay for nearly 5 minutes while the cashier finished wiping down a stack of trays before she decided to check me out. And it's not like she didn't see me... I was about to grab my tray and walk away, and let her come find me when she was ready to do her job. Their drink station is always a mess and the ice teas and lemonades are always empty. It scares me to think about what's happening in the places we can't see!"}
{"text":"Prefer Costa Vida... which is right down the street, same exact idea but fresher ingredients. I have been to Cafe Rio multiple time. The employees at this location could use some customer service training. The same girl made my order all the way through the line and asked me multiple times what I wanted, then proceeded to grab what I said I didn't want. At the register they tried overcharging me because she forgot what I ordered right after she just put the clear lids on...yeah, pretty much!"}
{"text":"Wow! We had really high hopes for Café Rio. After a 30 minute wait in line we received our spicy green  pork burrito  with habanero's. It was just okay and not spicy! The guacamole was good . I think the organization needs to figure out how they can quickly pushed people through the lines. The wait was not worth the quality of the food. However I will try it again since they just opened and I have several people come here and love it."}
{"text":"I don't get it, I've been coming here for years. I've lived here in Centennial hills and I've been here since the restaurant opened. I've had great customer service until today. I love cafe rio food it's amazing, but unfortunately customer service can tarnish the experience. The restaurant closes at 10 and we got there at 9, The moment we walked in this young lady greeted us nicely. However, the moment she asked me what I'd like to eat I responded \"a burrito please\" .... she then replies with a \"excuse me?\" In a tone I did not feel comfortable with. I assumed she really didn't hear me so we continued with my order and then my girlfriend tries to ask for a sample of the chile roast beef. At this time I could tell she wasn't used to getting asked for samples. She says no word as she roles her eyes heavily and sighs as she moves her hand slowly to the sample cups. .... my girlfriend and I became uncomfortable but again didn't want this body language of hers to phase us. So as she continues with the order the lady asks if my girlfriend would like rice and beans, my girlfriend responds \"yes please on the side!\" ... at this moment i became to understand that the worker then not only rolled her eyes... but sighed heavily and started Murmuring under her breath as if she were cursing us out.... I immediately felt uncomfortable, and very displeased.   I could understand if we were giving her a hard time on specific orders , but we've ordered here plenty of times before. I could understand if we were the last minute customers but we got there an hour before the restaurant closes and there ended up being 4 customers behind us. I could understand if the worker had to place the order first then prepare the meal like most restaurants, but all of the food at Cafe pre-prepped, it literally takes less than a minute to prepare the food. So maybe she had a bad day, or maybe she was thinking of something else. However, while working in a restaurant where customer service is crucial, regardless of what's happening in your day... you shouldn't take it out on your customers... having that type of attitude is completely unnecessary, especially if we are literally right in front of you."}
{"text":"Very similar to Chipotle or Costa Vida, however offers some nice flavors. I ordered a quesadilla and found it to be a little pricey considering I didn't get any sides. My friends chicken was under cooked and visible raw in places. The manager was confrontational claiming the chicken had been cooked to temperature, when a simple look would tell otherwise. She reluctantly refunded him not for the cost of his whole meal, but only the chicken dish. Silver lining I would recommend mixing the Vanilla Coke and horchata at the soda fountain you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Didn't like it. Reminded me of eating at Disneyland, overpriced and mediocre food. $4.75 for a single steak taco with barely any meat. An order of chips and guacamole is a cup filled halfway with guacamole then covered with salsa and cheese to fill the container to the top. $4.50 for that is a joke. If I order guac I want a cup of guac not some other stuff thrown on top to try and make me feel like I got a full cup of guac!! I won't be returning. I can get a better meal for my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"So impressed. Came for lunch and will be back soon. The food was awesome.   Got the enchilada style burrito with shredded chicken, hot sauce and pinto beans and it was delicious. (Added sour cream)  Also hat he Saturday Special which was 2 shrimp tacos with rice and beans and a drink for around $9. We got one of each type of shrimp (coconut and Caribbean) and both were really good.   The real selling point for me is the fresh made tortillas that are hot and chewy and really what I want at any good Mexican restaurant.   We also really liked their sauces (the enchilada sauce and the cilantro ranch)   Last good thing to say is the drink fountains....in addition to normal coke products they have awesome horchada, mint lemonade, strawberry lemonade and limeade."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is awesome and the food is incredible. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I think we can all agree that the food is good at Cafe Rio. I personally like it better than Chipotle. The service at this location isn't great though.   In the past, when I go there the cashiers always gave us attitude and you'd wait on them to finish talking to their coworkers about life or whatever before ringing you up while a long line continues to build behind.   One time they pissed me off like never before. The cashier gave me so much attitude, they kept messing up my order, and when I got home there was hair in my food!! (I called back, spoke to the manager, and got a free burrito the next time I came, but like I was angry, tired and starving when I got home and couldn't even eat my food)  Anyways they've gotten better with their service it's mediocre, and the food is still the same. So props to them on improving, but the Henderson location is still much better. It looks nicer, they have better drinks and the employees try harder there."}
{"text":"Worst cafe rio I have been to. Rude employees and they are always out of everything. If you don't like your job don't work here.   Cafe rio  come and train theses  tards. I will drive the extra 5 min to the other cafe rio from now on. Go to the one on eastern or Stephanie for better food and service"}
{"text":"We have been going to this cafe rio location for a while. Location is great! Love this area!  The dining area seems to be well taken care of.  The staff doesn't seem to excited about work, they are always running around like crazy. They could use a few more bathrooms/stalls too! There have been numerous occasions where we see a line at the bathroom because they only have the one for each, male and female. My husband always raves about the Barbacoa pork! It's his favorite and he always gets it. It's his staple.  The homemade tortillas are awesome! They're always so fresh! It's cool to even see them being made as you wait in line. I always get the salad. The house dressing is my absolute favorite! But I do have to say that the rice and the shredded chicken or a little bit flavorless.  The variety of options for drinks is quite impressive. But every time we go there the lemonade and Horchata are always so low that you can't get a full drink out of it. We just got a new location closer to our home so I can't wait to try that one out!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a new cafe rio and it be closer to the house. The customer service is great and this location is extremely better than the one on Blue Diamond."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is definitely no Chipotle, but they're halfway decent. It seems Cafe Rio struggles with consistency. The food is either really good or really bad. The rice is usually undercooked and disgustingly crunchy. I typically mobile order and due to dietary restrictions I request there is no cheese on my burrito. Unless I am watching them make my order, it's like a game of Russian Roulette when ordering online because there have been many instances where I have requested no cheese and I end up having to reorder because my burrito is filled with cheese. That just wastes my time and there time. Speaking of having my time wasted, there has also been an issue of not having my food on time. I began requesting my order be ready 15 minutes before I actually arrive to make sure it was ready when I got there. Please get your act together because you have the POTENTIAL to be an awesome restaurant but it's the little things that are holding you back. Mint Limeade is always delicious, but I'm sure it cannot be that hard to make."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and good.  Bad communication from the workers.  Charged $1 for a sprinkle of cheese.  Yikes lol."}
{"text":"I AM a huge fan. Good sized portions and the food is always excellent. Hey, on the business side I am sure they make a fortune for extra cheese and salad dressing. I am 5 stars for the chain in general but at this location on Thursday night I experience the line from hell.  Their \"call in/app in for pick up\" kitchen service area was not in operation and they were processing all of these go orders in the regular service line...at dinner time.  Just curious why? Short staffed?  I will go back. I just hate poor efficiency in a proven process."}
{"text":"I ordered a quesadilla with steak. Very quick to make and the taste wasn't. Not too salty on the meat. I would rather it was sliced in half at least."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this... If you're looking for a chipotle type of place, skip chipotle and come here. Either way, the salsa is mild, even the hot sauce is mild. Mild but it has a lot of flavor. For a good and okay place, come here. Try the steak burrito & mint lime drink!!!! My 5 year got a free cheese \"Nino quesadilla\". This is on my side of town and I thought it was okay. Nice atmosphere.... For a fast food type of place!!"}
{"text":"Good food but consistent poor service-nobody acts like they care-don't bother ordering online- it'll actually take you longer once you get there then if you went thru the service line-I'll drive further to avoid this location which is sad because we need good places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This location is quite possibly *the* slowest Cafe Rio on the planet. No joke. We've been there maybe four times and it always seems as though it's everyone's first day on the job. Now, coming from St George, UT where the original Cafe Rio was born, we hold the standard pretty high and this East Mesa location doesn't even hold a candle. Slow service, dirty tables, 86'd some menu items, burned grilled chicken, and did I mention S-L-O-W."}
{"text":"First time here and it will probably be my last. Customer service sucks and the food isn't that great. I got a smothered steak burrito and the steak is extremely salty. Also not very happy about feeling like we really didn't have a choice in what we got on our items. The guy was basically already dumping it on the food while asking if we wanted it or not. I wanted mine smothered but did I really get a choice of sauce.....? Nope, just got what I had wanted inside my burrito. Wanted cheese on top too but already dumped the jack cheese on top when I would have rather had the mix cheese. But whatever. I thought maybe I could get by the fact that these employees have horrible customer service because I was hoping the food would be amazing. Well it isn't. I am not impressed with it. Besides the steak being salty, not the flavor I would like, there really isn't any other flavor. Maybe it would have been better if I was actually able to choose what sauce I wanted it smothered with.... Probably not. There's better places around for a smothered burrito and their customer service is way better. The only reason I would go back to Cafe Rio is for the horchata! It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Its quality. It's made fresh. But I always leave feeling like something flavor wise is missing. However, I do like their shredded pork and their fresh tortillas. But they do hit your pockets for sour cream and guacamole (based on amount ). Kind of a self aware Chipotle Sans the beer. But with a superior drink and dessert selection. ..and homemade quality tortillas."}
{"text":"This place is ok... been here a few times because all the other coworkers agreed to come here. Food is pretty ok. The sweet pork is the best meat available. Downside is the tacos and burritos made with this or any meat have way too much liquid coming out, causing a mess and unwanted soggyness. But ingredients are fresh! The guacamole portion is way too small... which then takes me into the service. Ordering here is a little confusing and counter productive from the few times I been here and from what other people have said. It's a very slow moving line and they move your plate along so fast when you need to change or add they have to bring it back interrupting the other order they are working on. The seating area is ok, some wobbly tables.  The mint limeade is really good!"}
{"text":"I like this Cafe Rio! Customer service was spot on when I went in. Other locations rush you through the process and it feels chaotic, but this location took its time making my food. Food tasted very fresh as well. I really love their sweet pork and enchiladas with green sauce. I'm so glad they put in a Cafe Rio in this shopping center."}
{"text":"Delicious food....fresh....fresh...   Resonably priced.  Don't forget your punch card"}
{"text":"I always get the sweet barbacoa pork carnivals,  as it is one  of their signature items.. and hi oh always get enough portions for two meals, so I get to take. Something home. ."}
{"text":"I ordered three tacos this past Saturday(8/6/16) and they were over 12 bucks with tax and no drink.    Unreal prices and the food is definitely not worth it. They were just okay, Taco Bell is much better and more affordable. Avoid this rip off place.  What a joke.    They keep raising their prices too honking the public won't notice.    I won't be back"}
{"text":"I am sitting here eating my burrito right now (Sept 4th Labor Day) at 5:00pm and it's clear as day that the male kid working is high AF. Mistake after mistake! Said it would take 30 minutes to get me Salmon, whaaat? Salmon takes 7 minutes. Also didn't give me rice or beans like I asked. Forgot the cream sauce that I wanted, and didn't hear a word I said after repeating myself several times. I notice the owner doesn't even respond to their Yelp reviews to so I guess this one will just stick around here forever unless they address the concern of having an underage toker on their staff who can't think straight."}
{"text":"While I was home in Idaho, a new restaurant was opening, called Cafe Rio. Being Twin Falls, Idaho, a sleepy little town, this was a BIG deal. Lines were out the door, but my sister and I decided to brave the crowd.  I was so glad we did.  Fast forward one month to my first paycheck back in Phoenix, and my roommate and I are cruising along past Phoenix.. Tempe.. Mesa.. and find ourselves in Gilbert, for the sole purpose of getting a salad.  Now, this is not just any salad, but it is one of the most delicious taco salads I have ever had. Lettuce, tortilla strips, cojita cheese, rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and meat of your choice (pork barbacoa. ALWAYS choose the pork barbacoa!) nestled in a warm tortilla that was made right before your eyes, then drizzled in the house creamy cilantro dressing. Uh-mazing.   I can only testify to this one dish however. (Or I suppose the tostada.. exact same, except instead of the flour tortilla, a small corn tortilla). The first time I went I got the quesadilla with chile roasted beef. It was okay.. I wouldn't have been back if it wasn't for me trying my sister's salad, which we have established is enough for me to spend my finite resources on (cash, gas).  The service here also leaves a bit to be desired, but whatever. I'm not here for the ambiance (although some very nice art pieces), or the clientele (lots of families), or the reading material (The Beehive).  They do have a customer loyalty card - buy 10 meals get 1 free- which seems to be a dying art these days, which is just too bad, because Cafe Rio has made a loyal customer out of me!"}
{"text":"Walked in And smelt like sewer. Front server talking about how her feet hurts as she reaches down towards her feet like she just slipped her shoes back on after coming from the back. There are barely anyone in here and the seater says at the door please hold while I find you a table and not to mention there's like over 20 tables empty. after seating us she only gave us one menu. So My daughter got up to get another one from the front door because no one was any where to be found. During the visit I asked if there was virgin margaritas for my kids  and said she would find out and never came back (Seriously). In the mean time I already ordered and foods not here. Chips and salsa came out 15 minutes after we were sitting. I already drank a margarita and had an appetizer delivered. We had to ask for a refill on the kids drinks. These are the type of things you do as a waiter. Fries tasted like they were freezer burned. Not the best quality of food and very Poor service. Not one to complain and write a review but how can you fix something if you don't know."}
{"text":"NOTICE, they open at 10:30 am. I went in at 2:00 pm on a Saturday, ordered enchiladas, and the employee began filling the tortillas and rolling them into the pan when (luckily I was watching or else she would not have said anything) the tortillas completely cracked, I have never seen a tortilla crack from a simple roll unless it was a) stale or b) old, so I asked if there were fresh ones since this is something Cafe Rio preaches on \"handmade tortillas rolled fresh by the minute\" and I was told they ran out of tortillas and their manager doesn't come in for another 30 minutes. Then I had to decide if I wanted to continue eating there or go somewhere else and at this point I was starving so I settled for less than what I came here for and ordered a burrito. Not to mention, my friend who ordered a burrito in front of me got the bottom of the sweet pork pan so he felt he got skimped on meat. To me, this experience was not worth the $10 plate I paid for. Its unfortunate because I would come here frequently since it is known for its fresh ingredients and quality food (most of the time) but it doesn't take much and an uncaring employee to turn one away! On top of all this commotion, I was not given a receipt which urks me because when I want my opinion to be heard I have no receipt to reference to."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Customer service sucked! Waited patiently as prepare thoroughly completed patron before me order, came to me and Listened but not really to my order as she took the next patrons order and answered questions, I'm still patient ... after the dry demeanor I walked out after I watched my food get thrown to empty cashier station as the preparer went back to giggling with other patrons! At least yell for cashier!!! I didn't come for cold food! And I was very patient"}
{"text":"Very bad OMG  We came there to eat some Healthy food like salad the worst place we ever been before the food was all over the counter Just from going in and looking the way to handling the food out there no we don't have their hands on my food anyway we left right away I don't think will ever go there. First time experience 0000000 star....."}
{"text":"My physics teacher was talking about the big ol' round tortilla cooking thingy, so I had to check it out. It is right across the street from UNLV so easy peesy. Food was very tasty, I had a chicken salad in a tortilla of course, yummy! The restaurant dining area was clean and the staff was helpful and nice. The tea was empty, all of the teas were empty :( so I had a soda, not a fan of soda.. Anywho, really yummy food here, I recommend it..."}
{"text":"I always come here when in Vegas. I think it is so unique and the food is fresh. My only complaint is they need to sprain the water off the beans. Very good food."}
{"text":"Honestly is terrible the only thing thats worth getting is the quesadilla with cheese and even thats not worth going out of your way for taco bell is vetter and much cheaper i can't see why so many people like it for the life of me the whole restaurant is constantly dirty including the restrooms and the food is always cold place sucks ordered my food to go and they literally just threw it in a little tin container without making sure it wont spill the customer service is just bad honestly the whole place is just terrible just take your money and go someplace else"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has a wonderful box lunch delivered right your home or office. Great for those business meetings for parties."}
{"text":"I generally dont write reviews on fast food type places because they tend to be the same, a-ok type food. This place was horrible though.  Came here on a Sunday night at 8pm. Proceed to wait inline and order food. There was only 1 person in front of us yet it took forever to get our food! The burrito maker kid messed up the burrito for the person in front of us 2 times so he had to remake it over and over. Then when it came to my turn i ordered a grilled chicken burrito basic toppings. He places it in the conveyor heater and proceeds to finish the 1st customers order. My burrito goes through the conveyor and comes out and just sits there...what was the point of heating it up if it get cold sitting there?? Finally the customer in front finishes. I get my burrito and order a side of chips+salsa. Again i wait for the guy to go in the back to get more chips.   So i finally sit down to eat my burrito. Its not good at all. Its not even hot. The chicken tastes like the Tyson brand frozen stuff you get at the supermarket. The rice had no flavor, it was basically a tasteless burrito. The only thing that was good was the salsa for the chips. I really didnt see the hype for this place. Chipotle is 10x better and the chicken taste like chicken! definitely would not eat here ever again. id rather get a hotdog from 7-11"}
{"text":"Fresh,delicious, and fast! Never had an issue here and been multiple times. I love the pork salad and mint limeaid. Personally I think it's way better than chipotle. For fast food mexican, I give this 5 stars. They even make the tortilla they use fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"I give you 3 instead of 1 only because the food is fantastic!! The service at this location was so so horrible!! Every time I have been here the service is absolute crap, they look super annoyed and depressed and they are really rude. You need to find employees that are friendly and  professional, because based on my experience and all the other reviews it is clearly a problem!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The pork is a little to sweet for my taste. But always fast and always friendly. If it's crowded don't be discouraged the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Great food but long lines at lunch makes you to want to call ahead. Very nice place to meet someone and chat."}
{"text":"I was on Blue Diamond and saw Cafe Rio so I decided to turn in for some food before work. I've been to the Cafe Rio by UNLV before and had a great experience.   Cafe Rio is a fast casual Mexican restaurant...so these reviews about their customer service needs to stop...they are not meant to run like a dining restaurant...  I tried ordering 10 chicken tacos but they didn't have enough chicken for 10 so I settled for what they had + some steak tacos. It was late so I understand and appreciate that they don't just have an abundance of ingredients out, ready for the next day the night before. I had the tacos with lettuce cheese guacamole and their house sauce. The guacamole was alright...I can do without next time.  They have a ton of hot sauces to choose from which is just amazing because who doesn't like to have options?  The food is decent and the portions are pretty big for the price you pay. I would go back whenever I'm craving a quick bite...there are definitely a lot of options to choose from.   Try them out:)"}
{"text":"Ya they are super skimpy here. It's like let's put on as little as possible..... It's so good but the price is way rediculous. I feel like I need to order 2 burritos to get full and that would be like $30 so no thank you."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here. Sometimes it can get busy so waiting gets kinda long but it's not so bad.   I usually get the fire grilled salmon tostado with cilantro vinaigrette and love it every time. They aren't stingy with their portions which is a plus. They have a great variety of different drinks and even serve horchata. Staff is friendly and there's plenty of tables so it doesn't get crowded."}
{"text":"Been coming to cafe rio for awesome fast Mexican food for years. Lived in Utah for a while...just like you Camilla k. I loved the ones in Utah and thought I would give this one a chance. The manager guy, don't know his name, is a total jerk. The food wasn't even warm. It was cold. My wife and I are sitting here right now and I'm so upset that I have to leave this review right now. Just awful service and not even good food anymore. Gradually getting worse. I'm going to costa vida from now on."}
{"text":"HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN-PLEASE READ  I do not know what has happened to this particular Cafe Rio. Three years ago, my wife and I decided to see what the hype was with Cafe Rio, so we decided to go to the Mesa location. We were blown away by the quality of food, the happy and customer-friendly staff, that a year later (2 years ago), we had this location cater our wedding. Once again, the management, the workers, food, were excellent that we went every other week for a year straight.   Then, we decided to take a pretty long hiatus from Cafe Rio. I would say 3 months ago we decided to come back, and everything is different staff wise, and not in a good way. On taco tuesdays, the lines used to move efficiently with a smiling face from their workers making your food....that no longer exists. Easily can take an hour with 1/2 the line they used to have, the workers there rush your order...they just dont seem happy   being there, from the start of your food process to the payment...EVERY worker gave us, the customers bad vibes.  I went there last night, wasn't even that busy, 50 minutes to get my food. Told management the soda machines were out of ice...10 minutes go by and no one refills the machine with ice. Horchata was out, I let management know, a worker, 15 minutes later, just started working on opening the powder milk can...  These are some examples of the b.s operation going on at this location, and I would recommend to NOT go here anymore. Costa Vida is just down the road, they have much better service with same prices."}
{"text":"Barbacoa. Amazing Pork Barbacoa.  The Good: The salads turn into giant glorious burritos. Everything is made in front of you so you can adjust what and how much of it is put into your food. Tortillas made right in front of your face. Every 10th meal free! Free Food for kids. The Tomatillo ranch is exquisite! The first time my brain ever said \"Google this shit and see if we can make it home.\". So yes, it's good for it's \"just above fast food\" demographic.   Caveat: I don't know what anything else tastes like because I keep just ordering the Barbacoa Salad with extra Barbacoa. I have no plans to change my order. If you had said salad you wouldn't either.  The bad: This one is stingy with the meat compared to the one on eastern. Also the whole restaurant doesn't need to know I want extra meat. Whoever thought it was a good idea to yell these things is a moron.  Me gusta."}
{"text":"Wow! OMG! Make it end! These are phrases I utter to myself whilst camping in the line at this particular Cafe Rio. I have no idea what transpired at this location but I would literally drive to the other side of town to get my Cafe Rio fix. I have been here a total of 3 times, each visit more disastrous than the last. One evening, like a Monday, they literally had no protein other than shredded chicken left. I also had to wait for lettuce. That's right kids, lettuce. Not sure if this is a franchise situation but owning the name and storefront doesn't excuse under staffing and poor inventory planning. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is the best. Staff at this location is fast and friendly. Love that they make their food fresh every day you can really taste the difference"}
{"text":"Not bad.  The format's pretty similar to Chipotle where you go up and order and pay at the register at the end.  The prices are a bit higher, but the food tastes better.  The chicken salad was huge.  The tortillas are freshly made.  The place is clean and spacious.  The employees are friendly too."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service .... Food handler is rude and nasty ... But has no problem being kind to the person behind us who talks lower than we did. Then the supposed mgr has no Interest in fixing it   Then we sit and eat our food and watch the food handler who has issues chain smoke for 20 mins then go back to handling food"}
{"text":"Not bad at all!!! The food was fresh, of course. The flavor was spot on and filled my gut with goodness. The store was pretty clean especially for being a dinner rush. This is the best Cafe Rio I've eaten at. I would eat the Rio often back in Utah, and it was never this good. The employees were fairly friendly, seemed a little overwhelmed, yet managed pretty good. I would for sure go back to this location. I especially liked the deal I got by downloading their app. $5-$5-$5, which made feeding three of us affordable. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Great food! You could really tell that everything was fresh. The salsa was fantastic. The queso had a great flavor and was not just your standard melted cheese. I had the chili roast beef taco. It had so much flavor.  The house made ranch was also really good."}
{"text":"Had a 2 for 1 coupon so I got two giant burritos for like ~$8.50. What a deal! Tortilla was delicious and crispy, pork barbacoa was yummy. Had a sweet flavor to it which added to the taste. Maybe a little expensive if I did not have a coupon for the delicious food I got for my money, I am super happy!"}
{"text":"Omg no.  Grilled chicken tasted like old Fry's chicken rubbed on a dirty skillet.  I paid 10 dollars for lettuce, old chicken and Pico  .  I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"I think I was having lust for new flavors and a mystical tortilla cooking wheel. I don't really like Cafe Rio, I decided.   The staff seems pretty flustered/annoyed most of the time. It's nearly impossible to hear what they asking you over how loud the kitchen is. I know there's a lot going on, but if they would just calm down, everything would be a lot better.  The drinks still get a big set of stars, though. I love the lemonade and limeade options and horchata if you are into all that. I might try again something I haven't had before, but sadly, it no longer tops my list."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is soooo freakin good!! They're always fresh and have all the flavors I love! I never get tired of the shredded beef salad. And the manager is excellent about customer service!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. This Cafe Rio visit confused me. It didn't taste quite like the new one on Stephanie in Henderson. It was very very salty! The service was strange as well--two people alternated fixing my dish and taking payment for it.   I still love that tortilla wheel--it never gets old, but then again I'm easily impressed. I wish I would have gotten my bean/cheese/rice burrito enchilada style, because it was nearly impossible to eat as a burrito anyway--too gooey and needed a fork to scoop into my mouth.   My belly was still happy, though not as happy as it could have been. A major plus for this place (and maybe for the stars aligning just right) is that I left my cell phone in the bathroom, drove to UNLV and (gasp!) realized after I had parked that it was missing. I rushed back (I don't think I have been such a \"Vegas Driver\", ever) and lo and behold, it was still there! I got durn lucky, that's for sure, but I like to think it's just good people going to Cafe Rio that aren't stealing my precious iPhone."}
{"text":"Great location. Right next to a gym. Smart decision.   Fresh food. You can see them make everything they offer right there. Such simple straight forward food that tastes like restaurant quality.   The salad is splendid. It comes with a house made sauce that is just delicious. It is almost like a creamier fancy ranch with flavors that come together so splendid. I believe they said lime and cilantro were key in there.  Quesedilla is the size of your head and like an inch thick with meat and cheese.  MUST GET THE MINT LIMEADE. Not too sweet. Love the hints of mint rolling around with the sweet lime.   I'll stop by here for dinner a couple times a week and I'll go to the henderson location for lunch. Sometimes I get this 2 times in a day."}
{"text":"Fresh food! I don't need to say anymore! But I will...  $10 for a salad that fills you up for 24 hours! $2.50 - $3 for a side of chicken/steak that is entree portioned.  You can see them making everything they serve right in front of your eyes.   I love this location because they are generous with the meat and the customer service is ON POINT! They try to get you through their super long lines as quickly as the customers will allow.   I go here at LEAST once a week, as it is right by my work."}
{"text":"This review is for THIS Cafe Rio. I LOVE Cafe Rio, so when they opened one close to me I was so excited that I went opening day!  There was something different about their tortillas....they tasted....stale. They were a bit stingy with the meat.   Came here several more times in hopes they would become like the henderson and centennial ones I love.   I watched several times how they make their tortillas, they cook them early on and pull them from a bag instead of serving fresh. They are beyond STINGY with the meat. I asked for extra meat (which you have to pay for) and they legit gave me only 2 TBS more!  DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Just another run place to get Mexican food at. Nothing to write home about. They have tacos, burritos , something akin to a taco salad, quessedilla, and a enchilada. The only thing surprising for this place is the calorie counts which can be close to 2000 per dish. The meat and sauces are very sweet not to my taste but my wife loves it. The place is clean but a little loud. Servers are plesant and prepare a fresh tortilla for each customer. The tortilla is my favorite part."}
{"text":"I had cafe rio at a party - Food was great so I thought I would try the Resturant- I won't be back to this one - the staff looked like they hated their jobs and that customers were a burden - the lady cashier was very rude - some young gal - I was in the area - Food was good customer service not so much - thought they would be better than this cause I was gonna order a catering order from them next week - not any more - I'll go to another location"}
{"text":"I've been a Rio-er for quite some time. It didn't help that I used to work at a frozen custard place right next to a cafe rio.  But tonight, I'm quite upset. Service was slow, food was great, but it seems like shortcuts are being taken and quality is being hindered.  I'm highly upset because my freakin' horchata was empty! I came to drink the milk of the Hispanic gods, but to my dismay the fountain was dry.  They ran out of corn tortillas, an aluminum pan is used to catch the soda fountain water, and the staff didn't make me smile. I'm unhappy.   I'm gonna go to the other location. Sorry Henderson Rio."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and it is pretty good. The food is delicious however the service is often slow. That's not a big deal though considering that the food is pretty great."}
{"text":"I've always heard many great things about Cafe Rio and it wasn't until recently that I took that chance of trying something new, other than the usual weekly chipotle run.  Their menu is something new to me so I had to just stand there for a bit and decide what to try......*drum roll* it was decided, grilled chicken salad!   What amazed me at Cafe Rio is that they make all their tortillas Fresh!  I have never been to a fast food chain where tortillas are made fresh!  And boooyyy are those fresh tortillas delicious!    This salad is made with the tortilla as the base, topped with some chopped lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, grilled chicken, and other garnishes, and you have a choice between a creamy dressing or an oil based dressing.  I'm not a fan of creamy dressings, so I tried the lime cilantro oil dressing and it hit the spot!    This place is very delicious and fresh!  For those of you who have not tried it yet, it is a must!    Now onto my next opinion, although Cafe Rio is good, it is so different from Chipotle and yes, Chipotle still is on my list of favorite places to go to eat!"}
{"text":"Only giving two stars because the food was good, other than that I would not recommend this place unless you want to be treated like crap or you're starving. First time they were busy and were having a hard time, so I understood, second time it was just me and my sister and still their customer service sucked!   Sorry we ruined your social time girls!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. Order pick up if you don't like lines, this place is always popping!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. There are numerous vegetarian options. The staff is friendly. The one thing I would caution you is that they will up-charge you for items that they shouldn't like side of salsa or a chicken entree when it's vegetarian. If you are asking for extra something, then I understand but when they say they are better than chipotle and then charge me for salsa, that's not ok. This has now happened twice to me. When you check out, you may want to ensure you're not getting up-charged. I now order online which eliminates this issue."}
{"text":"I rarely try anything other than the pork burrito enchilada style because it tastes so dam good! The tres leches cake is also way better than it looks (my friend was not pleased when I ate the whole thing!) My only problem is that I feel it's a little overpriced at over $10 for this burrito. Yes it tastes great but it's basically nice fast food so I think it should be a couple of dollars cheaper."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about great staff. They are all very attentive and caring. The manager, Jessica always goes above and beyond to make sure customers are taken care. Once I didn't like an item I order and she went out of her way to make sure I understand the process and exchanged it. A few minutes later came by to ask how was it. Food is really good and fresh. I love this location."}
{"text":"We went to Cafe Rio for the first time this weekend. It was moderately busy but definitely not packed. The vibe is cool and fun. Everyone is greeted by the manager (he may be the owner) and you can actually watch the tortillas being rolled out and cooked. Sadly, that's where the good factor ends. The make line is severely understaffed which leads to food waiting for several minutes. This results in meat being cold. Additionally, the order of the make ready is a bit strange. For my salad a tiny spoonful (it measured about 1/2 tablespoon) of meat is placed in the very bottom of the pan with copious amounts of lettuce piled on topped and all other additions (sour cream, avocado, pico etc.) being extra charge. I asked for salsa and it was with the meat so I received an eye roll from the server and my request was ignored. By the time I got to our table, my salad meat and my husbands tacos were super cold. And the flavor was subpar. Similar to the taco seasoning found at the grocery story.  I will agree with other reviewers who noticed how most of the sides/condiments were out of stock and the area was messy. It's sad that the restaurant is like that. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio cannot get orders for groups right.  I have tried through their Catering line, online, and over the phone and they NEVER have gotten the order correct.  This time, the order was placed online and paid for online.  Pick up time for 11:45.  The order was not ready at 11:45 or noon for that matter.  And the person behind the counter asked for our list of food we ordered instead of reading it off their computer!  They received the online order because they received the payment.  The order was not ready until 12:30.  We asked for a manager and were denied.  This is going to corporate.  No, we will not be placing any group orders every again and will we tell everyone at the office about our experience."}
{"text":"Finally a good Cafe Rio that actually cooks rice all the way through and has awesome service"}
{"text":"Staff is rude and online orders are always wrong then you get told by staff that you're a liar when you say that they didn't put something in your bag that you paid for! Management there is no help either! I will not return to this location!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend.  I ordered the Nachos with no meat.  It was a pretty large serving and came topped with Cheese, Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Salsa, Rice.  I was surprised that they put rice on their Nachos.  I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.  My friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.  One cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.  Will I return?  At some point, probably....but it's not my 1st or 2nd choice."}
{"text":"I really love how The food tastes the menu might seem small but it actually has a wide variety of things you can order! I usually like to get the burritos and the tostadas and both taste amazing when you get the enchilada style it's like the icing on the cake! One thing I really like about them though is that I've come in there and they're still very fast paced about getting your order so it saves you time if you're stopping by on your lunch break all-around great place to eat"}
{"text":"Today they lost a couple stars from me based solely on the glaringly obvious problem of having a huge takeout business and only one cashier for dine in customers & takeout.  In the past we've waited while she checks out the walk up takeout customer and it wasn't a problem although the line behind us was really backed up. Today only one young woman assembling the food and working hard at it but there were many employees there doing nothing? Then, the apparently \"only\" person who could check us out was on the telephone with her back to us while at least 8 others walked past and not a single one would make eye contact or speak to us. So freakin weird & our food sat there getting cold and the line was crazy backed up? I finally said to no one in particular, \"someone better get their ass over here and take my money or we're going to walk!\" She gets off the phone and steps over not making eye contact or giving up an I'm sorry and checks us out with a sarcastic, \"have a wonderful evening\". Not cool on any level, made me have a bad \"psd off\" lunch. Now, I GET the negative comments from others in the past."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Salad with ranch is there best item.  Staff are not super helpful and the line takes for ever."}
{"text":"Food was good but service and dining room conditions left much to be desired.   Like that we have one close to home but would rather drive to Chandler location to have better service and clean tables."}
{"text":"The shredded chicken is soooo good! You can't beat taco Tuesday. They are quick and have great customer service. Make sure you sign up for the rewards program!"}
{"text":"My friend told me that Cafe Rio was an upscale Chipotle, and loving Chipotle I had to try. I am not a fan of Chipotles pork but she said i must try it here, and o my god was she right. I got the sweet pork barbacoa salad and it was delicious! The tortillas were fresh and the dressing is light and pairs perfectly with the rest of the salad. I am in love. The portions are also huge and a salad can last me lunch for 2-3 days. I always order to-go so i can not say much about the service except my food is always ready when they say it will be and have never had a rude cashier yet. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"If only they had this place in Southern California, then I would never have to hear another suburbanite talk about Chipotle!   This place is great! If you're looking for  authentic authentic Mexican food, obviously you won't find it from a chain restaurant. But their food here is DELICIOUS! I highly recommend the sweet pork barbacoa! For a drink, definitely have to try their mint limeade...sooooooooooooooooooooo good. The mint limeade is half of the reason I come here.   Another great thing about this place is their staff! Everyone was super friendly and cordial. It's nice to walk into a place that has staff with a smile on their face...just makes the whole experience of dining somewhere a little more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to a beef quesadilla, it's 5pm and they are out of beef!?! Left without a purchase, so disappointing.."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Cafe Rio and the food was amazing! I got the sweet pork salad but without the lettuce so it was more like a bowl type deal. The tortillas are made fresh and you can see the lady making them while you are In line which is pretty cool. The cheese dip was pretty tasty as well. I will defiantly be back because the food was great BUT the staff was not so great.  No one was smiling so it just felt awkward at first, and considering I had never been there before I didn't really know how it worked or what was good to put on my food or what even my options where. I just went down the line and the worker just looked at me waiting for me to talk, without asking me what I wanted. So it was kind of weird and I didn't see tortilla strips until he had moved on to the next person, let's just say I felt rushed and awkward. Then getting to the checkout part of the line and the girl rings my boyfriend and I up and gives me a total and I give her money.  Then some other worker (not part of ordering process) comes up and looks at the tray of food and says \"make sure you charge her for that cheese and sour cream.\" Without a smile or even a glance my way. The girl did not respond and just changed my total and said you didn't give me enough money..... yes I did for the first total not the one the very rude girl created by telling you to add charges! In my option the price for cheese compared to the amount I got was not worth it and I was not informed the items I was adding to my dish would be extra. Overall they need a more upbeat and informative staff."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is by far the worst one here in Las Vegas. One serving of chicken ANYWHERE else is 3x the amount they give here. I watched the worker actually take some back from my bowl. The rice is always a gamble. Either you get the regular rice or there's a chance the cook will dump an entire container of salt. I always order a shredded chicken salad, regular portions, and they always give the bigger lid. This place, however, can easily place the smaller lid on. Overall, just avoid this Cafe Rio specifically. The only reason I'm okay with giving this place a one-star is because they gave us a free salad because of their screwup."}
{"text":"I really love Cafe Rio food. But this is absolutely the worst service I have ever seen!!!! I keep giving this Cafe Rio location chances and chances but I am disappointed every single time. I have never seen a lack of urgency from a group of young people behind a counter serving food. They don't mind have 20-30 people staring at them in line while they are all just going at the slowest pace I have ever seen. I always get my food to go but the dining area is always dirty looking. I don't know who is managing this place but they really need to hire new staff and get this place in check!"}
{"text":"An upscale Chipotle style diner serving burritos, tacos, quesadillas and other things.  Greeted before ordering. Ordering went smooth and easily.  Each staff has a certain responsibility although that didn't seem to work smoothly.  There are still kinks to be worked out.  It wasn't a bad wait though and we were confused if they brought the food out to the customer or if we should wait.  That could be made more clear at the register.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla to share.  It comes with pico de gallo, sour cream, lettuce and guacamole.  A little skimpy on the guacamole.   Also the chicken could have been spread more evenly on the tortilla.  My first end bite of the quesadilla had zero chicken.  We were humored during our meal with a staff song about cheese and later another short rally about the food.  The employees seemed like a good team."}
{"text":"I've been to this location probably over 10 times, and ordered catering from here. They are fantastic and the quality is consistent! I love the wet burritos and salads and quesadillas! The mint lemonade is amazing!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a catering order here tonight  for 25 people.. taco bar... pork and chicken...management is phenomenal. They had my order ready on time and everything perfect and labeled! I always come to this location... everything is always the best quality! I use cafe rio for catering all the time. Best presentation and quality for the best price."}
{"text":"Mike, Vicky, and Dave were all SO beyond helpful and accommodating getting a last minute catering order ready. They had it ready early and were so amazingly helpful and the food prep was incredible. Will definitely use the location again for catering!"}
{"text":"Cafe rio been here plenty of times and I just love it. Better than Chipotle or rubios ect.. I always get a salad never disappointed maybe one day I'll venture off and get something else but the salad is to good to give up.  But yesterday I came in and wanted steak they had none left and I had to wait about 15 minutes for some when talking about good customer service they didn't charge for my double meat on both salads!!! Gave me a free drink and extra stamps on the frequency card and continually apologized they made me feel important i would give that 5 stars alone. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This location is always busy but I have never had an issue until tonight. As I was picking up my order, I noticed they gave me the wrong dressing. I went up to exchange and a gentleman was at the counter complaining of his order being wrong. We laughed and I left. When I got home, the salad was pork, with cilantro, beans and pico. I ordered chicken, no beans, no cilantro and no pico. I decided not to cause a fuss and drive all the way back. That was until I PULLED SEVERAL LONG BLACK HAIRS out of the chunks of pork and beans deep from within the salad. When I went to get a refund, they didn't even check the salad and the woman next to me was also receiving a refund for having received a wrong order. They offered to remake my salad (hence the star) but I was not about to ingest more hair and who knows what else from this place. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"The food is good, as always. This location not so friendly or clean.   Since living in Vegas I have really come to love Cafe Rio. This location is extremely convenient because it is located so close to the university and because of that I have eaten here the most of any in Vegas.   I find the food to be as good here as in most locations. The PORK BARBACOA IS SIMPLE AMAZING! I never get anything else! My favorite is the quesadilla, but I usually go for the healthier tostada option. Don't be fooled, this is not even close to a traditional tostada, it's more like a salad but a hard corn shell hidden somewhere at the bottom. The tostado, starting from the bottom: hard shell, meat choice, melted cheese, A LOT OF LETTUCE, pico, cheese, cilantro, chips, sour cream.   This particular location is definitely lacking in cleanliness and customer service. The floors are usually dirty and the trash cans are almost always overflowing. The employees don't act like they want to be there and are usually holding conversations with the other employees instead of the customer. They are nice enough but definitely lack in customer service skills.   All-in-all I stop in frequently not because of the customer service, but because the food it good, cheap, fast, and the barbaco pork is so dang amazing!"}
{"text":"Very nice visuals upon walking in. You get to see how tortillas are made if you've never seen it in person (I'm from Puerto Rico, so I haven't seen it). Good food very similar to Its competitor."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this location cannot get their customer service under control. The food is good enough, they all taste the same. But this location is just awful if you are looking for any type of \"quick meal\". Came in at 6pm on a Wednesday and waited over 30 min in line before we could even order. Unfortunately this isn't a one time experience, but it will be the last time.   Come on Cafe Rio. Get it together. It's a conveyor belt ordering process. Staff your store, train employees to not just stand around staring at customers, and figure it out."}
{"text":"My first experience with Cafe Rio was in St. George, UT and I loved it and my Mormon friends are constantly raving about it, so I was really excited when one opened here in AZ.  I've been to the Gilbert location several times and my experiences have all been pretty consistent. I love the food. Love it. My favorite is the pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style. It's SO good (especially if you like your barbacoa on the sweeter side like I do). Also, their tortillas are made fresh in front of you and they are so delicious.  Here is where they lose 2 stars for me...  The way you have to order is complicated. My first time there I was totally confused. It's somewhat set up like Chipotle as others have said. However, the counter is too high and you can't hear the guy on the other side, nor can he hear you. The menu needs to be simplified for that kind of ordering. It's not a sit down place where you can go over the menu. People are waiting behind you so there is pressure to order fast and you really just can't with that menu.  Also, each time the customer service is mediocre. They rush you through and seem annoyed when you don't know exactly what you want right away. For example, I said no beans so they asked if I wanted extra meat. I said no. When I went to check out, they charged me for extra meat. They either didn't listen or misheard me, but I think that could have been avoided had they just slowed down for 2 seconds. There was no one behind me.  Furthermore, it is overpriced and you will pay extra for every.little.thing. Side of guac? Sour cream? Enchilada style? $1, $1, $1...it adds up. I remember one time before I knew about all the extra charges, I walked out paying $12 something for one burrito. That is totally ridiculous.  Nevertheless, the food keeps me coming back. Plus, it's a very family friendly environment. The place is always packed with Mormons and their kids so I always feel very comfortable bringing my 3 and 5 year olds."}
{"text":"Just ate here and I'm pretty disappointed with the service. The food was good as usual, but the customer service sucks.   I walked in and was the only one standing in line. I had 3 employees standing there talking amongst each other that had a full on conversation before even greeting me.   As I started eating my food, I hear one them start to say \"I hate when customers....\" I couldn't hear the rest.   The point is, the staff sucks. I've gotten better service at Jack in the Box which is pretty sad.   To the owner/ manager: Please teach your employees common customer service."}
{"text":"Went in at 10:29, they closed at 11... the entire staff was hanging out in the dining area. The chairs were on top of the tables, and when the line cook saw me walk in, she threw a fit and stomped her way back to the kitchen. I left instead of dealing with her. Cafe Rio in general is one of my favorites. This location, absolutely not."}
{"text":"I had heard of people raving about Cafe Rio even before this location was open. I didn't know exactly what to order my first two times coming here and I think I opted for some vegetarian options because I didn't want to burn a hole in my pocket. I was not a fan at all and didn't bother to come back. However, once again I encountered a person who was raving about their sweet pork barbacoa. She was totally right! This is pretty much the only thing worth ordering. While everything else is pretty much just blah. The nice moist sweet flavored pork is greaaat! I highly recommend the salad because it also comes with the tortilla. I absolutely love the texture, when I found of they sold them separately it made me kinda excited. The salad portion is actually big enough to share. And for those starving college students who think $8 is a little steep for a salad the tostada is pretty much the same as the salad but it only cost $6. So basically cafe rio= sweet pork barbacoa."}
{"text":"How hard is it to put some beans, rice, cheese and meat into a tortilla...then add some lettuce and Pico on top and get you out the door...if you are ordering at the Cafe Rio....REALLLLLLY hard.  Seriously. It's fast food...already prepared...sitting in warming and cooling bins in front of you. Food is always good...but the service at the counter is getting slower and slower and slower.  Nothing kills a restaurant faster than crappy slow service.  But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Food here is good I have no complaints about that. Crappy part is it's the closest one to my house and the people that work here are never nice. They make it seem like you're bothering them and if you have any questions don't bother because you're not going to get an answer anyway. 3rd time we've come to this location and everyone is so horribly miserable we won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG awesomeness !! A must have in Las Vegas ! If you like Chipotle then you will love this place it's like a less complicated chipotle with better tasting food !!! 2 snaps and a twist I likedididid it a lot!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice Sunday lunch.  My wife likes corn tortillas,  they were out so the staff made a fresh batch of masa,  seriously the made it fresh.  My daughter and I had a burrito and tacos....Very good.   We will be adding this to our short list of date night family go to. The staff was great, the manager is definitely a customer service master."}
{"text":"This place is super addictive!!! The fresh handmade tortillas here are what really set them apart from chipotle or qdoba. I recommend the shredded chicken quesadilla its really good!"}
{"text":"This place takes delicious Mexican food to another level.  The fresh baked tortillas, high quality ingredients, warmed in the oven equals savory goodness.  I have visited this store about six times and have had a great experience every time, other than having to wait briefly for call ahead take out once.  The food is highly customizable, making it perfect for vegetarians or those with dietary restrictions.  The indoor seating area is large, and there are also tables outside for the cooler months.  They have specials each day of the week.  My husband loves the Monday special of Chile Relleno, but we wish it was offered everyday."}
{"text":"At first I was excited that there was a Cafe Rio near by, considering I will only go to the one on Eastern because there has always been issues with the other locations. I went in Saturday Feb 7th, they were rather busy, I do not mind waiting but I the person was moving through the line trying to take my order before I was even up to the glass. When you have to yell at me over people that is probably the time should wait and allow the line to catch up.  I was trying to order slow in hopes that the line would start moving. I ordered a salad, and asked for no rice, and of course there was rice. I asked to add sauce which when I opened the salad was very minimal.  I was very disappointed.   The one thing that really bothers me is that I order several times through their catering and get meal vouchers which I was using. The cashier was upset or pissed off that I was using a voucher, and her attitude towards me really showed. She even wanted to charge me for a side of sour cream, which I have never been charged for. This is the second time visiting this location and using a voucher. I got the same response from the cashier. Its not like they are paying for my meal, so I do not get why there is always a bad attitude attached with theses vouchers.  I spent a few hundred dollars so I should not get the negative attitude when I come in there.  This visit was a true disappointment. It is safe to say that I will never be back, I didn't even eat my salad I was so disgusted with them.   The Eastern location is so friendly, all the staff members are great, the manager always has an amazing and pleasant attitude. For me it is worth the drive to go to the Eastern location. I have used my vouchers there numerous times and have never gotten negative reactions."}
{"text":"This is a new cafe Rio. I went for dinner with my boyfriend. They were having a special on tostadas that looked delicious. The boy behind the glass didn't know what he was doing or didn't care because he put so much water from the beans onto my tortilla then scooped entirely too much chicken onto the sloppy, wet beans and tortilla. I told him it was way too much and he put it back in the chicken container (not sure if you're supposed to do that). When we got to the salsa I asked if it was hot or mild and he replied, \"I don't know.\" I kind of giggled and said \"ok then.\" My tortilla was wet and soggy but the food was good. We got chips and queso so I just turned my meal into nachos basically.   My bf got a burrito but the boy put the wrong enchilada sauce on top so he wasn't very happy either. This guy was comical. We were kinda mad but more just laughing at the ridiculousness, lol.   Positive note: the queso is really delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in this location lately. There's always been the issue of the staff being hit and miss but the food and accuracy was on point. But not lately.  If you are placing an order to go....beware and good luck getting what you ordered! We have ordered to go 3 times in the past two weeks. Items were missing each time.   Last night we were charged $9.99 for one shrimp taco, it was suppose to be 2. And the quacamole was spoiled.   If you order in....the food is right but the staff all seem to wish they weren't there.  Customer service seems to be gone."}
{"text":"A bad staff ruins a business...the managers should really look into hiring quality employees who take pride in their work.no one likes to eat at a place that's hit-or-miss on quality of product or service."}
{"text":"The staff here are so friendly and welcoming! I'm going To this location specially because of how great the staff are. The sweet pork burrito enchilada style is to die for. There huge also so I always have left overs and surprisingly the leftovers are still so good tasting. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I do believe that Cafe Rio is a good place to eat but my last experience here was very disappointing. I had ordered a chicken burrito with not too many toppings. I was looking forward to this meal but as I did eat the burrito I was met with the saltiest chicken that I have ever tasted. It was so overpowering that I could not even eat half of the burrito. Since this experience, I have not eaten here at all but I do hope to try it another time. At this time however,  I cannot say that I will not be skeptical about the chicken because anytime I go there that is something that I will keep in mind."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some Cafe Rio. So after a long day at wet n wild we were excited to come to our favorite spot. I understand this location is fairly new, so I'm giving them a little learning curve. I ordered cheese enchiladas. The rice is super crunchy and I had to ask for fresh guacamole because the one on the line was brown. I was going to get a salad, or tacos but all the meat looked dried. The drink bar was really dirty. There's was a hair on the straws even. We'll try it again this summer, hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Consistent quality and taste.  Food is fresh and selection of proteins are good.  We like that you can customize your burrito, tacos, or enchiladas how ever you like.  The jamica and mint lemonade are very refreshing.  We eat here often."}
{"text":"Shut the front door!! This place is amazing-Vegas, y'all got to stop hating on them. SO FREAKING GOOD!! A long line to order means good food. Yum-freaking O!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it doesn't get better than Café Rîo. Everything is crazy fresh - I CANNOT get enough of those tortillas! You THINK you've had a good tortilla until you've experienced these. They're made right in front of you, are super light, chewy and just plain incredible. The flavors are on point, and they don't slop greasy ingredients into your bowl.   I love the options here, too. Although I'm in love with the tortillas, I've recently gone gluten-free - so the salad (without the tortilla) was a PERFECT solution for me. I got all the things I love about Café Rîo, minus the gluten, and the servings are MASSIVE.   Thanks for giving us a healthier option with quick service!"}
{"text":"I mean, this is Café Rio. You know that the food is going to be absolutely phenomenal each and every time you consume it. You also know that the line is going to be long, and slow. You've got to take the good with the bad.  I find that the line is worth the wait. And if you know you're heading there you should definitely just call ahead it makes it possible for you just to grab your food and go or even pick it up and sit at the table. Removing the stress from the entire situation."}
{"text":"The food is great but service is terrible at this location. I accidentally asked for the house dressing instead of the vinaigrette and you would have thought I asked them for the world on a platter. The restaurant was an absolute mess, napkins and food all over the floor, sticky tables and even though I informed someone that the soda fountain was out of syrup, it wasn't attended to the entire time we were there.   It's a shame to have such a poor representation of this great chain."}
{"text":"Along with a restaurant in Puerto Vallarta called  Pipi's (http://www.pipis.com.mx/), Cafe Rio has the best guacamole I have ever tasted. Super fresh and absolutely delicious.   We also loved watching the tortillas being made freshly before our eyes.   Please come to Seattle, Cafe Rio! You have the most authentic Mexican food I've had from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"My kids love it! I have been a couple times and I enjoy it. It is not the best Mexican food I have had but I enjoy the process. It is kind of like a Chipotle but a bit different. I enjoy the quesadilla and the burritos. When you go I suggest getting the burrito enchilada style."}
{"text":"First off I will say that I love the menu and the food. This was my first time to this location and I wasn't happy at all!!!! First of all the servers think that everyone is supposed to know the menu and how you are supposed to order, NOT OK! Second every time I told her what I wanted I got corrected with an attitude. The food was just thrown in to the container and was so sloppy. That has never happened to me at the location on Blue Diamond. I will never go back to this location and would definitely not recommend going. And I would definitely say they need to learn customer service!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled that there is a Cafe Rio close by! Never really felt like driving the distance to go eat so having them right down the street is awesome!  I have been here quiet a few times since they opened and they have been on point every single time! My favorites are the fire grilled steak quesadilla,  the shredded chicken tacos, and the tostadas with the cilantro dressing. Love the salsa and quest and their ginger lemonade is the freaking BOMB!!!  The food is always fresh and delish! Customer service is great, although sometimes a few of the girls could smile. But for theist part everyone is nice. The place is always clean as well as the restrooms. Definitely in my top five places to eat when I want a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I try to give places a break. But, I've think I've had it with chains, at least this one. My family keeps asking to eat at Cafe' Rio. Oh, the infamous, oh so popular, extra tasty Cafe' Rio. I gave up on this place awhile ago. I'm specifically addressing the W. Sahara location. Before, it was moving at a snail's pace to make my food, which usually meant eventually getting it to go, only to find the extras I was charged for weren't there. So ok, I'll give it a go because it's been awhile. Well, it was exactly the same as I remembered. From the first person literally throwing my food from the grill to the prep area without looking to see if someone else's stuff was there to the guy in the middle that was too busy talking to another guy to the point there were backed up tins of food waiting. My quesadilla was cold when I took a bite. I walked over to get a drink because I paid for a \"specialty\" drink. I look to get my drink, and not one, but 7 are out. All of the specials (non-fountain) drinks are out, both teas and one fountain drink.  We were told they are gone for the day. Mind you, they are open for 3 and a half more hours. No attempt to refill any of them. In fact, I watched one of the ladies take both tea dispensers and start cleaning them. One of guys came over to get a drink and when I mentioned something, he said \"it's like this all the time at night\". I saw each workers come out one by one, get a drink, sit, text and such and not wash their hands. So, if you want Mexican, go to a Mexican place. If you want mill workers, cold food, no drinks at a higher place, this is your place."}
{"text":"I love this place, always had great service, a hearty meal, tasty, and quick to get in and out if you are pinched for time!    Very clean and fun to eat at.  I recommend to the individual who loves American Mexican Food !"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Café Rio for over a year now. This location has a friendly atmosphere, and customer service is very helpful.  If you're looking for quality tasting food, I highly  recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Food is 4 Star quality. Service is 1 star. How hard is it to not screw up an order. Also way too many times have I been here for pickup and they give no salad dressings or no sauce. Even with a small line it takes them forever to get through this  line. I have been to MANY other locations and all the problems with this one goes back to management"}
{"text":"Updating review because service and quality of food has been much better with the last three visits at this location. Staff still needs to work on consistency and ensuring all orders are correct. We'll return as long as they keep improving. Also, can you please ask the company update the app? The mobile app is horrible!"}
{"text":"Tasty food but overpriced and I wouldn't recommend taking it to go as it gets soggy quick."}
{"text":"I mean it's Cafe Rio, so it's pretty good. But it's kinda irritating when the workers are more interested in flirting with each other than finishing my order. And then as soon as my order came off the conveyor belt, they all disappeared. One employee had to go get the cashier out also. Very rude."}
{"text":"Just ordered Cafe Rio catering and the food was great and the set up was so easy!!!!  Everyone loved the food- fresh and tasty!  Thank you"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep ordering café rio! everytime I order I am always disappointed but today was beyond horrible. our office ordered thru postmates and café rio forgot to give a bag of food to the driver....but the driver states that he asked if there was any more food and the café rio told him no. regardless nothing was done to fix the mistake. I had to call at least 4 times to get someone to correct the issue. I called about 12:45pm and was told the postmates driver had already shows up and now its 1:36pm and nothing! THE FOOD was half decent, one of the chicken salads was horrible and the chicken was dry and hard!  NEVER WILL I ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I love the food from cafe Rio but I have not had very good service at this location. I went in with a coupon, as did everyone else, and at 5:30 on a Friday night they were out of everything you could get without paying for an up charge. The woman in front of me complained about having to pay when they were out of what she wanted and the manager refused to allow a substitution. That defeats the purpose of sending out a coupon. It brought you the business and then you squashed any chance of getting repeat business when your service is like that!!"}
{"text":"\"What happened?\"  \"Nothing ... she's a lil' bitch.\"  Whoa! I had no idea what was going on and why this middle-aged, polite-looking, homely Caucasian lady was telling her lunch-mate that someone was a bitch, or words to that effect; however, this is the Café Río at the university neighbourhood, so ... shitty service is the norm. It is par.   In other words, she was undoubtedly referring to an employee from the Mormon-owned chain. And possibly justifiably so.  The food is the same here as it is in Summerlin, in Centennial, in Aliante, across the street from Henderson on the Las Vegas side of Eastern, or in fucking Utah. It's a chain (with A-OK food). But the service here ... oh man. It fucking blows.   --------------------------------------------------­­­­-----------------------  \"They go the same speed if there is one person in line or if there are twenty.\"  I disagree with this separate, thirty-something-year-old, dissatisfied regular sporting a UNLV-Tarkanian shirt. (Go Rebels.) I think they actually go slower when there are more people in queue. For, they know -- from experience -- that some patrons will walk out in defeat.   Remember: quitters never win. But to win at this Café Río, one might have to wait twenty minutes before even having one's food. YMMV.  Rating: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"This place was once a go to for my family and I because the food was yummy and the service was really good. That was three years ago.  I walked in today, the employees working behind the window looked upset and unhappy ( um, you chose this job, right?). There was no guac and steak available at 3:30 in the afternoon. Ok, I get it. But I do not think the employee should have an attitude when I say I will wait for it to be made. It actually took management an hour to make more guac and steak.  Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment. I will not be returning to this particular establishment again. It is too bad that it has become such a crappy place."}
{"text":"Sucks when you, the customer, know the proper ingredients better than the employees. Guys, the veggie burrito comes with guacamole!!"}
{"text":"Food is just O.K.! Most of the things on the menu are bland and soggy from sauces! Do really like the different flavors of lemonade that they have, if the tanks are kept full!"}
{"text":"Just went here today. Used to be one of my usual lunch spots and they will get an opportunity to redeem themselves, however, today was ridiculous. They gave me someone else's burrito and charged me twice for it. The little chick in the red shirt seemed like she was high or something and totally messed up at least 4 people's orders because she lost track of who ordered what.   Saddest part, this was at 11:00 am... They were not busy and I was starving. I ate my wrong, burnt burrito because I was starving. I am sorely disappointed in this trip. I've come to expect much better from you, Café Rio!"}
{"text":"The food here is on par for Cafe Rio standards and tasted great. The problem was with the staff. When we arrived the line was longer than the corral, and it CRAWLED. As I got to the front and saw the people working the line it was apparent they needed someone supervising them. They were distracted, scattered and lethargic. None looked enthusiastic about their job or at all concerned with the length of the line. But that would be forgivable and truly wasn't the source of the delays. It was the cashier, the receipt said her name was Kelly, who was texting the WHOLE TIME. She kept the phone in one hand while ringing people up and couldn't stop texting. At seeing this it became apparent there was no shift leader or manager present, either physically or mentally. This location needs a management overhaul. Employees should not be texting while working."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for several years. Very disappointed with the salsa and guacamole today. Both were too salty."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. This place is HORRIBLE, the attitudes of the employees there are terrible. If you're so unhappy working in food service then don't work in it. You walk in & you immediately become and inconvenience to these employees. Along with the horrible attitudes & shitty looks the food was awful. The tacos were a soggy messy, the girl slopped salsa on the tacos not even attempting to drain the excess liquid, it was basically taco soup, disgusting. The quesadilla they didn't cut & grease was everywhere. I will NEVER set foot in another cafe rio location. I can do a better job myself at home. Everyone there needs to be fired."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to live near the cafe rio located near where Eastern met the 215 and it was always awesome food. Now we live in a new place and luckily we found that it is fairly close to yet another cafe rio! Yay! It is real strange though seeing it located in such an empty shopping center... it is such a stark contrast to the other location which can be an insane mind numbing experience when it comes to finding parking. Not surprising though considering it is such a small lot with some really awesome food spots... *ahem* Nelson's Frozen Custard anyone? Anyway, back to cafe rio! lol.  Food is pretty good here, though they do tend to make the occasional errors ... forgetting a lime here or there, no guacamole, etc. Never anything huge though, and if you point it out politely to them they will fix it immediately without problem. Customer service has always been a big thing for us and it is probably one of the things that constantly brings us back here. NEVER have we had a problem with the employees or their service, they have always been super kind and helpful!   Our favorites are the salads, typically we get without rice or beans and just ask for extra lettuce and pico. My wife usually can't finish and I just barely squeek by, lol. Huge portions and with the giant homemade flour tortillas it is a very satisfying meal. Occasionally I'll get a burrito if I'm in the mood for more carbs. The hottest sauce they put on the burritos isn't all that strong, so if you want something more spicy make sure to grab one of the sauces from next to the drinks for that extra kick in the pants. If you want to try something a bit different though you can always try the daily specials! Every day but sunday is a different unique item, monday is chile rellanos for example and you won't find it on the menu any other time. The specials come with a drink included with the price.   Lastly, make sure you get a stamp card if you plan on coming back, 10 stamps and you get a free meal plus drink! lol, my wife and I already have 2 meals saved up for a special occasion when we are REALLY broke!"}
{"text":"The salads are what makes this a MUST for my wife and I. Fresh as it can be, they make everything right in front of you however you want it. They even make the tortillas fresh in the restaurant, straight from little dough balls! Both my wife and I order the salads without the rice and beans (neither one of us can really finish the salads otherwise, which is saying quite a lot about portion size here since I RARELY am unable to clear my plate, oink oink), I get the pork and she gets the steak with extra pico on top. They give you a choice of two dressings to choose from but we've found that the best choice is to get a bit of each and mix them together, they complement each other wonderfully! No need to get chips and salsa if you are ordering a salad for yourself, this meal will fill you nicely!  Now, if you really aren't craving a salad from here (tsk tsk), then the burritos are pretty damn good as well. I tried one the other day just for the sake of it and i was rather impressed with it. Very filling and it held together nicely, though I did have to eat it with a fork and knife due to size (not complaining though!).   I have yet to try the coconut shrimp tacos though, they are a special on tuesdays and I just can't seem to get there those days!! Grrrrr..."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Dank food and service. Everyone is so nice and the place looks cool and chill to hang out and eat really good mexican food.   Everything is fresh and warm, and they play good tunes."}
{"text":"So disappointing when a restaurant is known for their sweet pork and you go there all excited to eat it and they're out and won't have any for 2 and 1/2 hours. Then you also find out that they're out of rice and won't have that for 25 minutes. Major fail for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new, and Cafe Rio was next to the new Fry's. I decided to give it a go, and take out. The location was convenient and the exterior was inviting, with a cute patio on the south side of the business.  There were two doors in the front, and I used the north one. Not the right door. I entered into a maze of tables and shoeless children using benches like an amusement park and screaming. I should have turned around right then. The menu board was simple and self-explanatory. I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, a sweet barbacoa pork quesadilla, chips and queso, and a tres leches cake.  The service area floor was a mess. The service counters were also a mess. There were 5 employees, and they were a hot mess. Except for the tortilla dude. He was rocking it.   I am off the rice and beans, so I just had shredded chicken, tomatilla salsa and cheese. The chicken was wet, and hardly shredded. I had huge, unmanageable pieces in my burrito. Though there was salsa, I couldn't taste it. The whole thing tasted like an air burrito, with more mass. No flavor. The quesadilla was not even started, and the girl made it as I checked out. The pork was not bad. The chips weren't ready either,  so I had to wait a few minutes for fresh chips. The queso was very thick and super salty. It did have a zing that got you afterward, so at least it had flavor. The tres leches cake was good. Lunchtime, and they ran out of whipped cream already. So there's that. And the fact that the leche spilled all over my bag into a sticky mess. Eh.  I don't know that I'd come back here. For 30 bucks, I'd rather go get flavorful Mexican food for 6 people at the taco truck down the street."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican restaurant for people who don't like Mexican food. With so many options in Phoenix, it boggles my mind that this place has a line. It tastes like my old college cafeteria's attempt at Mexican. 2 stars because the drink selection is pretty great."}
{"text":"I am hooked on this place. Food is always on point. And the amount of food you recieve is plenty. Really can't beat the price either. My lady and me visit regularly."}
{"text":"Really excellent tasting food  Great prices & a reward club app that beats the rest! Walked right to the front with no line- yes!- got my meals made & even filled out the survey for a FREE tres leche dessert. Love how close this Ft Apache/Sahara is to my house"}
{"text":"My family goes here somewhat often....maybe once or twice a month.  My daughter has a gluten allergy so she has to order the corn tortillas.  This particular visit my daughter ordered tacos with corn tortillas as usual and we were just told \"we don't have any\" which really equated to \"we don't want to make any\".  When I questioned the server, another employee must have heard and came over and said \"I'll just make some\".  Granted, she did.  But, seriously?!  You sell corn tortillas and just made a customer feel like they are putting you out to make what you say you serve?  This attitude, coupled with the insanely long wait for fast food.....I guess I'll just stick with Chipotle where I don't feel like they're doing me a special favor to make me the food on their menu."}
{"text":"I always go to this location right by my house.. I was very disappointed when I asked for my usual veggie enchiladas and the server told me they are no longer allowed to put beans inside any enchiladas, tacos etc and that their managers claim that it is a\"waste of food\"... How exactly is it a waste of food if I will be eating it? It makes no sense and I don't eat meat therefore I have to make other options for myself. I will be sticking with chipotle from now on they always make whatever I want!!"}
{"text":"This location is the only one we have tried and with our experience generous portions of meat , very tasty food . Good lemonade very friendly staff  ,"}
{"text":"Why this franchise owner doesn't staff his restaurant with a halfway decent level of competence is mind boggling - How do you have Zero grilled chicken at precisely 5:00 pm - Just as the dinner crowd is getting ready to stop in - I was told \"it will be a 20 minute wait for the chicken to be ready...\" I used to go in with the same issue but being told \"no chicken...\"  when I reached the order position after having waited for 20 minutes. Really - maybe a quick informal sign apologizing but at least telling customers so they didn't waste their time - I'm guessing that's why there is no longer long waits at this location - people like me got tired of getting disappointed by this franchise and go less often - I would be willing to bet their numbers have declined over the last 2 years! Too bad because when it's good - It's great!"}
{"text":"So went to cafe rio for lunch because I had a coupon so i figured why now? Get there and pretty full tables but no line so I was greeted by a nice Hispanic girl who was friendly and professional. Ordered the grilled chicken salad to go with the tortilla on the side and she even asked if I wanted the cheese on it! Cheese, yes!!! She passed it to the register girl who was also friendly and showed her my coupon and paid and left! Great quick experience and good staff working today! Food tastes great and fresh and I'm very please! Thanks cafe rio!"}
{"text":"Close to work and always a busy location but why is everyone always working hard and friendly. Even during the lunch rush everyone is so polite and considerate. Martin usually helps me here when I pick up my order and he makes u feel like you're at a 5 star restaurant. Food is amazing and always fresh. They even review your order with you before you leave. Come here almost daily for lunch. Much better than other locations."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot of help. Usually when I come, which is a Thursday after work (6-6:30pmish), it is jam packed! I don't think the employees were properly trained on how to handle huge customer volume because they seem to be all over the place. Literally. I had one employee who was working the register leave right when it was my time to pay, deciding that would be a good time for her to jump on the line and help the others put together food. This is completely unacceptable. I couldn't make heads or tails on who the manager was to make a complaint, so I have done it here from time to time during tips option.  I really like Cafe Rio and this location is so convenient because it is less than 5 minutes from my house, hence the only reason I am giving it two stars, otherwise it would get one. If they can sort out how to handle large crowds, they'd be fine. Every time I have come here, it has been a issue with them handling large crowds. There was even a time when they ran out of grilled chicken and I had to let 5 or more people cut in front of me, mid assembly, until they made more! Don't come here during after work hours. Not sure what it's like any other time, I only come on Thursdays after work."}
{"text":"This location is unbelievable. 30-minute wait for about 10 people in line. Undertrained staffs who have no idea what they are doing. They also make online orders right in front of you which makes everything that much more intolerable. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"It appears they raise their prices again. They have a new menu board and it includes kid's meals. They let me get one which I appreciated as honestly there other meals are wayyyyy to many calories. For $3.78 I got a kid size queso with chicken, rice, chips and a drink..fine by me! I like them but I just think their regular menu items are getting pretty expensive,.,"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! We recently moved to the area and were so excited to have a new place with amazing food close by. However, we are so disappointed with the customer service at this particular location. We have repeatedly waited in line forever just to be told they are out of items. Ordering online and told they never received our order. I do not blame the staff but management as it is their responsibility to train and take ownership while keeping their loyal customers first ."}
{"text":"It was taco Tuesday so I decided to try cafe rio. Being that it was my first time there I was asking some questions to the lady behind the counter. I was wondering what came on the tacos what was extra. The lady behind the counter looked at me like I had 3 heads glaring at me hardly answering back. She looked at me like I was her worst enemy. Other than that the food was good. I had the chicken tacos with guacamole. The guacamole was decent. They had a ton of different lemonades that looked really tasty. The food was decent and the portions are huge! One entree is enough to share. I enjoyed cafe rios food I will only go back there if I happen to be in the area. The food was good but the customer service was not so great!"}
{"text":"First time there today 7/3. Was very pleased with food. Good and fresh  Dining room needed to be cleaned for new customers. But overall very pleased"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is how clean it is. I've been here a couple of times. The food portions change time to time. The food isn't as good as other locations. The customer service isn't the best."}
{"text":"I have been to several Cafe Rio's in the valley.  But they finally opened this one close to my house.  I have been here about 20 times but have still not found a perfect time to come here its always packed and i say they could open another one right next door and it would be just as packed.    Everything is good.  But we have settled on the Pulled chicken Salad as being the best.  Here is how I order it:  Wheat tortilla, Cheese - with both beans no rice (white carbs) pulled chicken.  Shredded lettuce its smaller pieces and every thing else.  Here is the best part ask for the House dressing and the vinaigrette  mixed.  You will not be disappointed and will never be able to go back to just one.    I have had the tamales, Chile relleno, Nacho's, chips and salsa (get the Cheese) the tortilla soup is really good as well.  they also have a nino Quesadillia for the little ones thats free."}
{"text":"After hearing that a worker refused to serve 2 of our police officers, I will no longer visit this Cafe Rio.  I will return if I hear that the employee was fired.  People seem to think that employment is a given."}
{"text":"$27 for 4 tacos with chips and drinks. Four soggy tacos that included cilantro stems, cheese they put on my food before identifying an up charge (I wanted the cheese, but don't shaft people like that not everyone is willing to pay extra for a normal topping). I strongly dislike flour tortillas but it was never a given option to have otherwise (corn). The cashier was friendly so that's where the second star comes from. Sadly, his kind demeanor is not enough to encourage a second visit."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and all the food there. My family goes here at least once a week and we're all fans of the food but the service lately has been just awful. I just tried to go in for tacos at 10:55. The young lady at the counter rudely tried to tell me that they only had certain food available and could not make tacos because they closed in 5 minutes and had put everything away. There were multiple customers inside who had been there before me and were also denied food because the staff had started cleaning up before closing time. I walked out without anyone offering to help the situation and without any apologies from the staff. I still love cade rio food but definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Leider nicht die erste Wahl in Las Vegas. Geschmack wird hier leider nicht so groß geschrieben. Portionen Ok, Preis geht so. Wir haben nicht aufgegessen. Der burito war Geschmacklich für die Tonne.  Vllt. Versuche es andere noch einmal in einem Jahr."}
{"text":"Came here with a group from work.  Short wait, great food.  (I love the variety in food choice, style and \"spicy-ness\")  Dining Room was clean and orderly.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"I called in my order to your Eastern Ave store on 9/10/13. Had my son go in to pick up the order. So when I got the order home to my surprise my complete order was wrong So I called in and they said that I could go in that day or the following day to re order my meals. So I went in yesterday to re order my order and once again I got my order Home and I was missing a few items this time. I'm very disappointed that two days in a row I came home from your store and my order was wrong.."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had the Tuesday Coconut Shrimp Tacos.  They were alright.  Didn't care for the mango sauce they came with, it looked more like mango compote.  I used the salad dressing instead.  The restaurant looks a bit dirty.  Someone should be cleaning the tables regularly."}
{"text":"No. This is not authentic Mexican food. Did you really expect it to be? I don't get the obsession with this place either. This chain is extremely popular in Utah and everytime I visit I struggle to see why.   I consider this place a few notches below chipotle. And here's why:  1. The wait. Cafe Rio does the exact same thing as Chipotle. Make a burrito, a salad, or quesadilla. How long does it take to throw some toppings in a silver bowl? At most I've waited 5 min to make a burrito at Chipotle. Cafe Rio, I've been in line 15 min before I can even order.   2.  My blood pressure rises every time I've eaten here. Can we say salty food?? The rice, the pulled chicken. Lay off the salt!!   3. Ok I'll give you an extra star for giving me a scoop of guacamole. Including it in the price is a good idea.   4. How much was my salad?! $8?! Wow. This is the most expensive salad ever. Do you think layering the bottom of the bowl with a tortilla warrants an extra $2 more than a chipotle salad?!  So basically, this is an expensive fast food joint where the food is so-so. I guess if there aren't any other options it'll do.  The service is extremely slow."}
{"text":"We have had bugs in our food twice now. The first time it was cooked in something and tried it again. Last week there was a live bug crawling on my salad. They continued serving customers the same food. The did not toss anything. I will never return."}
{"text":"How can I start this review I just moved from cali  to Vegas 3 months ago I'm looking for different restaurants to eat.. when on Yelp to check for new restaurants  in my area and I found Cafe Rio. I was so excited  to try it...I was very disappointed with the service the goung gentleman that help my son and I felt like he was being bothered more than trying to make us feel welcome being our first time there which I did mention to them. The young lady took over and she explained a little bit more about cafe rio, i did ask for steak and at 9 o'clock at night you guys were all out of steak which is kind of amazing to me when you guys close at 11 o'clock pm. I ordered a salad on accident that girl put guacamole. They remade it but the second time was even worse the tortilla was not even WARM the meat was COLD LIKE REALLY GUY'S  anyway.. my advice work on  customer service.. I will not be returning for the fact there similar restaurants like you guys in their customer service is great their food is great and they do make you feel welcome at home. I feel with a customer service and the food that I was given it was a waste of my money.."}
{"text":"Fatty, tasty food.  I wish the salad did not have a huge tortilla to make it filling.  The drink station never seems well stocked at lunch.  The staff does a good job moving people through line at lunch, but I always have a difficult time waiting 20 minutes to order this food."}
{"text":"I have to say I love cafe rio! Their food is simple yet delicious, the service is great as well as consistent, and my appetite and tummy are always satisfied. However I've been to this location 3 different times and have not experienced any of these.. Even though it may be convenient for many of us here in henderson, please listen to the other reviews and DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION ! New management is highly needed"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Cafe Rio Norterra. They always deliver wonderfully fresh EVERYTHING. from tortillas made fresh in front of you to the fresh pico and salsa.All the variety of meat fillings and sauces please all our family members. They have the BEST drinks with the fresh made Lemonades and Horchata.  Sometimes I want to go just for the Mint Lemonade. Usually a crowd but they move fast and always with a smile. Service is fast, friendly, helpful and very clean staff and restroom, kitchen, etc. You can see the whole crew making and doing the prep for salsas and tortillas etc. LOVE IT"}
{"text":"The shredded chicken salad is my go-to meal after a long day of work when I'm too lazy to cook. They are very generous with the serving size so it always lasts me 2-3 meals and actually stays fresh. Their house dressing is AMAZING.   During peak lunch/dinner times it can get pretty crowded and I've had to wait in line for a while sometimes. But the staff works quickly and they usually get the line moving."}
{"text":"Service was great. The guys and gal working were energetic and made me lol. I got the sweet pork on nachos with rice,sour cream,pico, and queso. The sweet pork is sweet! It was good and filling. They have a decent drink selection as well. The staff was on point."}
{"text":"Employee Caesar is wonderful.   I used to go this establishment several times a week and was so lucky to have Cesar waiting on me. Quality and service seem to go down and so did Caesars schedule soI quit going there for about two months just went there a couple days ago and was lucky enough to get Ceaser again they need to clone him.  They need to work on most of the associates and recognize the good ones."}
{"text":"I'm not their biggest fan, but I give it 3 1/2 stars.  I've heard it before, \"Café Rio puts Chipotle to shame.\", \"Café Rio is better than Chipotle.\", \"Café Rio is my liiiiifffeeee!\"  Okay, I didn't hear that last one...but I sure did see the viral video about that for Chipotle.  Either way you are getting the same thing...AN EXPENSIVE BURRITO.  I like Chipotle, I do.  Doing right for the environment blah, blah, blah.  Doing right for the consumer blah, blah, blah.  Doing right for the carnitas blah, blah, blah.  I get it, responsibility.  And I appreciate it.  And I appreciate my overstuffed grilled chicken burrito.  Sometimes you just want a change to see what else is out there.  Hence, the mosey on down to Café Rio.  Décor is very Southwestern meets Latin, unlike Chipotle who is more modern in style.  But the ordering process is very much the same.  See the menu, go down the factory-style line and choose your entrée, meat, beans, cheese, fillings, extras, then pay at the cashier.  Café Rio and Chipotle are very similar in this aspect.  Get in, order, get out ASAP.  The more people you process per hour, the more money you make.  Capitalism with a side of guacamole, I like it.  This is where much of the similarities end.  The food itself at both places is vastly different.  I've come accustomed over the years with the easy order process at Chipotle.  I've grown to like it for it's speed and convenience.  Café Rio easily has much more choices on the menu, but at the cost of speed.  Sometimes I don't want to wait that long in line.  Café Rio lines can get long, which takes up time.  I appreciate the many choices but it almost seems more like a sit down restaurant than a fast casual joint.  Food menu was a bit confusing for me at Café Rio so it left me a bit pressured to order quickly especially with the line building up rapidly behind me.    Of course I ended up going with an easier choice, a burrito with fire grilled chicken.  Burrito with chicken, black beans, cilantro lime rice, pico de gallo, salsa fresca, sour cream, cheese and extra lettuce, then extra lettuce on the side.  I like how they use the round foil trays for service as well as take out.  Overall it wasn't bad.     It was definitely missing something though, I couldn't put my finger on it.  Not enough seasoning?  Not enough cilantro?  The salsa choices at Chipotle have a bit more flavor, so my burrito at Café Rio ended up somewhat bland.  it was OK.    But you know what pi$$ed me off the most about my food?  The price!  It's already $7.79 for a burrito, but an extra DOLLAR for chicken that's been thrown on the grill?  That's $8.79 before tax!  Chipotle gives me just as hearty a burrito for $6.95.  That my friends, makes a big difference to me.  The quality of the burrito at Café Rio does not equate to an extra $1.84, at least not in my opinion.  Wifey got a taco meal which included rice & beans, but that didn't impress me much.  One of my kids got the salad which is actually very good because it comes with a tortilla underneath so it's more like a taco salad you see at Taco Bell, but again the price kinda kills it.  $8.49!  But I give props for that tasty cilantro lime vinaigrette, tangy and sweet.  My other kid got the meat quesadilla off the kid's menu, but it didn't fill her up.  She ended up sharing food with us.  We ordered a side of tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole to share at the table.  Chips and guacamole were great, very fresh.  On the plus side, Café Rio stands out in the drink department over Chipotle.  Coca-Cola for everyone!  Plus, you can partake in their more traditional drinks like horchata (which is pretty good), all included.    To sum it up, Café Rio isn't bad but it's far from my favorite fast casual place.  The food was OK but the prices were too much on the high end of the scale, ends up being comparable to eating in a sit down restaurant.  I would come here if I really needed a change of pace from Chipotle, but didn't want the grease of Del Taco or Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Ah, it's OK.  Apparently this new Café Rio took over what used to be a bead store (yes, a store with bead buying galore), and now it's one of the most frequented lunch spots in that area.  Located right behind McDonald's it certainly is in the hubbub of patrons.  But come on, it's Café Rio.  It's basically the same as the other ones around town, and a competitor to that other build your own burrito/taco/bowl/salad place Chipotle.  Coincidentally, right down the street on Lake Mead near In N Out Burger is a Chipotle.  So it comes down to personal preference.  And if you're looking really hard, pricing and soft drinks.  I'll admit, they make a darn fine salad.  If you make it right, it's like a burrito that internally combusted.  It's huge!  And probably my go to from now on at Café Rio.  A salad starts with a warm tortilla on the bottom of the tray.  Then it is topped with your choice of meat (I go roast beef or pork), beans (I go black (but I sometimes go back (to pinto))), and cilantro rice.  Then you get a healthy (I go heavy) portion of romaine lettuce, and any of their other sauces/salsas.  I opt for some corn, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, and a small scoop of guacamole.  Then top that bad boy with some fried tortilla strips!  I also choose the creamy cilantro dressing to go with my salad.  A bottle of hot sauce later, I'm in good eats land!  But this salad will set you back a hefty $8 -9 depending on your choice of meat.  Not the cheapest option for a meal considering it doesn't come with a drink.  But does Café Rio have some good drinks!  Not only is Coca-Cola product served, you also get your choice of some Mexican classics!  Horchata can be had to your refill hearts content.  So, a basic meal with a drink will cost you roughly $10 - 11.  Not the most value, but if you play it well you can get yourself a honkingly large entrée.  Think extras!    Taste is OK.  The tortillas at Café Rio are actually pretty good when they are warm, seems to be fresher made than Chipotle.  I do like Café Rio's creamy cilantro dressing, but I prefer Chipotle's vinaigrette a whole lot more.  Plus, Chipotle edges pricing out a tad by being $1 - 2 cheaper per entrée depending on what you get.  But Chipotle serves no Horchata!  But they do serve Corona!  So really, it kinda evens out.  Just boils all down to personal preference, or which one you feel like eating that day.  If you choose neither of these for some Mexican food, you will probably end up at Roberto's.  That's not a bad choice either.  Ole!"}
{"text":"Aye, why am I so scared to go back to that other casual Mexican dining restaurant who shall remain nameless?  It rhymes with \"Chipotle\".  OK, it's Chipotle...but it's only because I can't find anything to rhyme with Chipotle.  Oh yeah, now I remember why I don't wanna go back to the restaurant who shall remain nameless (CHIPOTLE).  Because of that whole food safety incident.  Ah.  So until I muster up the cojones to go back, I have to settle for places like Café Rio for my big burrito fix.  I mean, what can I say?  Café Rio isn't that bad.  Of course it's familiar because the concept is the same.  Pick your type of dish, pick your rice, pick your beans, pick your protein, pick your additions...blah, blah, blah.  The food is OK in my book, but some of the meat flavorings are a bit bland.  I kinda have an issue with the pork being overly sweet to go in my burrito.  I just don't get it, why is it so sweet?  I would kill for some regular fatty carnitas at Café Rio!  Don't give me sugar, give me FLAVOR!  Let it seep out the sides!  Let me cover it with some hot sauce!  Let me dab the oil stains off with extra napkins!  Instead...I get a burrito...that I have to eat with a fork & knife.  Don't get me wrong, when I pick out my fixins I always get extra lettuce and extra pico de gallo, add cotija cheese on top.  I mean, my burrito is buried under a mound of beautiful SALAD.  But that's just it, why am I eating a burrito that I can't even pick up with my HANDS??  Café Rio doesn't even wrap the burrito in foil for you!  They put it in an aluminum bowl and slide it through the oven!  It's like promoting no-hands eating!  Yes, that is a conundrum in of itself.  Very perplexing.  So while I don't have a problem with the food at Café Rio..I have a problem with the food at Café Rio.  It messes me up because I want to eat my burrito the way it should be, with my hands at the helm!!  Totally jacks up my psyche.  It's like, I'm not getting the full experience of my burrito.  It leaves me with the feeling that I've gone half-@$$ed on my lunch!  What person in their right mind eats a burrito without the use of their hands??  No offense to those who have no hands of course.  It just leaves me in a tizzy.  On the plus side, +1 star at Cafe Rio for serving all-you-can-drink HORCHATA.  Yours isn't bad at all, I can soak up at least 3 glasses on a good day.  Then I can leave with a refill of Coca-Cola & lime!  Tasty.  Café Rio, I'll be back when I figure out how to effectively eat your burritos with my hands!  I will resist the pretty greens & veggies you throw over my burrito!  Maybe move them to the side?  Maybe get them in a separate bowl?  I dunno.  Maybe I'll muster up the courage to go back to that other casual Mexican fine dining place...that shall remain nameless.  C-H-I-P-O-T-L-E"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is one if my fav tex mex places to eat.  This location was a little lackluster. It was  dirty/ messy inside. A lot of the tables had old food on them and the drinks area had tons of ice and spilled liquids everywhere. The staff was nice and quickly got the orders processed. The girl that took my order let me try the new green sauce which was actually pretty good, so I ordered a side of it.  My food was still good as usual. I ordered a chicken quesadilla that was huge! Chunks of white meat chicken, cheese, and home made tortilla! I always order chips & queso. The queso is always piping hot as well as chips. Their chips are always light, thin and crispy.  I had the limeade, and added additional lime syrup at the drinks station. Just the right tartness and sweetness. The mint really sets the drink off as well. I will def be back, but very unlikely to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Having heard great word of mouth about Cafe Rio I came here with high expectations. The foundation of their menu is based on fresh flavorful ingredients and on that note they delivered. The freshness of the produce is evident and the fire grilled chicken has a nice flavor profile, especially in concert with the black beans & rice and topped off with homemade tortilla strips, fresh cilantro, and tomatillo dressing. They really knocked it out of the park on the flavors!   Unfortunately this Cafe Rio missed the mark on the service side on this visit. The crew on the front line, the only ones interacting with customers, looked like they were working on an assembly line in a factory. The first person on the line was in a big hurry to get each order started and moving down the line. She basically threw a spoonful each of rice, beans, and chicken into a tin pan and passed it on.   The next worker (after a significant delay so she could restock her station) asked (mumbled) what else I wanted on my salad in a monotone that made it crystal clear she didn't want to be there. Then she piled a huge wad of lettuce on top of my salad, which ultimately made for a poorly balanced salad. Most of the lettuce was in pieces too large to eat without cutting but there was no room to do that without losing much of it over the side of the bowl. When I got to my table I removed about half of the lettuce which was a big improvement.   My salad finally made it to the register. After the couple in front of me paid for their food another man walked up to the register and cut in front of me to pay for a carry out order. The person running the cash register apparently found this acceptable which I assume comes from management. Basically my food just sat on a tray in front of me for an extra 2-3 minutes so someone else could receive preferential service by being able to pay for their order even though it was not even ready!   These issues on the front line could easily be managed by an on site hands-on operator to enhance the customer experience. Someone has taken their eye off the ball here. I hope it gets fixed because the food warrants a return visit."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but if it's going to improve an establishment, as this Cafe Rio so desperately needs, then I will leave a bad review. I have been here a handful of times and my complaints are very similar to other complaints. Every time I have come in here they have been out of something and not just little things, one time they were out of chicken and it was not late at night. Who does the ordering and prep for this place? It really seems like it's a bunch of teenagers, who don't care, running the show and there is no concern for cleanliness or customer satisfaction. You feel nickel and dimed  for everything and that with all the other issues is annoying. The very last time my husband I went there, I got a salad and drink and he got a burrito and drink and it was 30 dollars. The drink station was a MESS, wrappers everywhere, they were out of ice with no hurry to fill up ice bin, the \"specialty\" drinks were warm because I tried the mint drink and was immediately grossed out at how warm it was and since there was no ice I had to wait and remind someone again that there was no ice. The dining area was bad. If I had been paying better attention to the dining area when I walked in, I would have walked out after seeing the condition of it. I saw employees standing around with no care to clean or take pride in what they are getting paid to do and that is WORK. At this point they could probably offer me free meals and  I wouldn't come back because this location has had nothing but these same issues since it opened years ago and nothing is being done about it. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Food it tasty and a great portions for the price, we came here early on a Saturday morning not knowing what time they opened luckily as if timed perfectly got there just as it opened, we were the first in line but having never been here before we didn't know how to order or who to order too, stood there for about 10 mins just waiting, finally a guy placed tongs in the different compartments looks up and points at me and my sister. Being raised on customer service I didn't know what the pointing finger meant, I have never been there before is this like the soup nazi? He points you say your order and then quietly pay or no Burrito for you, now I saw all the pictures of burrito enchilada style and I was digging it and that's exactly what I ordered but the guy serving me said I shouldn't since I'm paying more for the same sauce and cheese that he puts in the burrito for free, so I decided ok not enchilada style since I don't want to look like an idiot for over paying, after I agree to not get enchilada style he ask me every time he adds a new ingredient if I want it enchilada style? I tell him you convinced me not to so no for the 5th time. So after he tells me which salsas he has and points to them as he names the types well I don't know if they switched the salsas from the usual order their in but he points at one and calls it hot then when I request mild he grabs the one he just said was hot, he did that to the medium as well so if I go back I have no idea which is which but I think I will pay a buck more for the enchilada style next time. The burrito has an interesting but delicious flavor I had the pork and I shared some nachos with my self, only gripe about the food is they cut the chicken way to thin you really don't get much flavor per bite almost string like meaning the chicken taste a lot more of the burn grill flavor then the natural flavor chicken has. Over all I will eat here again as food and quantity is excellent, just do me a favor don't point at your customers and don't assume everyone has eaten there before, especially if they're your first guest of the day and the restaurant is empty, the menu doesn't show pictures nor does your food look any different in the little metal bins, if you say pork I assume carnitas, and what I had was no carnitas, still delicious though and I'd eat it again."}
{"text":"I just drove here from the Blue Diamond location hungry, pissed off and frustrated for waiting in line for 35 minutes only to find out that they did not have the ONE thing I went in for. Queso dip. No sour cream either. So irritated  I called this Rhodes Ranch location and got the manager Tony who not only assured me they had what I wanted, he rectified the problems that the blue diamond location set me off about.  I've always had friendly, successful service here. My order has always been accurate and I've NEVER had to wait over 30 minutes for food.  This is my favorite location. Great parking right in front of the restaurant and of course the great cafe rio food we all come in for."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! Slowest service ever! I waited in line for 33 minutes only to find out the ONE thing I went in there for they did NOT have! I should have left when the ladies in front of me did. I only wanted their queso dip and chips. There was no time offered as to when a new batch may have been ready. I would have stuck around and waited for it.  While waiting in line I decided since I was there I'd try the new spicy hatch chili chicken in a quesadilla. When I got to the topping options they were out of sour cream. The kid offered me an additional scoop of guacamole as a substitute.  The cellphone service in there is crap (I have verizon) and there is no wifi. I mention this because at checkout I tried to have them scan my phone for their rewards program and it didn't work due to no service.  This isn't the first time I've had issues at this cafe too location. I love cafe rio food and this location is on my way home from work.  I was so pissed when I left that I called the Rhode's Ranch location on Durango & Warm Springs to see if they had queso dip. They did and that will be the only location I'll be returning to.  I will say that the staff at this blue diamond location was friendly, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff but a SERIOUS management problem. Every time I come here, something goes wrong and the employees are always swamped. The problem is not employee incompetence, but that they are ALWAYS understaffed. Management seriously needs to step it up here. Hire more employees and stop tying to cut corners. Seriously makes me never want to come here again. The poor employees are always so stressed and it's impossible not to get frustrated when they frequently get orders wrong because they're so swamped. Management: please change this!"}
{"text":"Get the burritos enchilada style for that extra cheese and red sauce. The burritos themselves are very fat and filling! I recommend the sweet barbacoa pork, it's different from traditional barbacoa but it's still delicious."}
{"text":"The dinning room so dirty , I can't believed ppl still go there and eat with there babies !!! Poor kids"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio. The food is so good and always taste fresh. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because of that one time I got a quesadilla and it lacked cheese. Also this location gets VERY busy during the school year."}
{"text":"Pretty much your standard casual mexican restaurant. Portions are huge which is nice, but I find that the dishes generally have way too much cheese and/or sauces. I know that is kind of standard for most mexican places, so if you are looking for that, you will probably enjoy it. Just not for me personally."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch and they were out of chicken, beef, salmon, and soda's.???! You can order pork or steak. How does this happen...new mgmt plz"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio but this one is definitely struggling to find a groove. Food tasted great but it took a really long time to get through the make line on a slow night. Staff seemed generally unhappy to be there - and I really don't expect bubble gum cheer when I get fast food. I am rooting for you guys though!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for some great quick Mexican food and it was take out pick up. Gave three stars since when got to the restaurant the staff did not even know or have our order. So replaced order and even the to go food took forever. Our server was not very pleasant and we were nice even though they did not have our order that by some mystery was invisible. Finally got food and was average not what this place used to be. Clean it up Cafe Rio, your tortilla are the greatest."}
{"text":"Love The chicken tostada they give you so much meat I really think this is a great value for eight bucks!"}
{"text":"By far the WORST customer service ever! The black girl that's there at night should be fired. How she still has her job is beyond me. I go in and ask for a simple order. I go to the black girl taking my order and I ask for two grilled chicken tacos she says well you can have one we're out of grilled chicken I said how long is the wait she says 7 mins. So the manager says I could pay and wait for the chicken as I told him my order. So I'm waiting and the manager (white tall skinny guy) says it'll be just a few more mins. 3 4 5 mins go by and I'm waiting. 10 mins go by still nothing. So I finally ask if the chicken is done and the black girl asks me to repeat my order once again!!! She says \"no one told me anything\" I said why is that my problem, should that be communicated with your team? I'm already furious she made it worse. She clearly hates her job and does not care about customer service. There are plenty of other options I can chose, but I choose cafe rio because of the food but there's other places that produce great product with great customer service. So never again. Say goodbye to a repeat customer. It shouldn't get to the point where a customer is furious to get the order right."}
{"text":"Holy homemade tortillas. Get in my belly!  This is a great fast casual mexican place that is mucho flavorful and at a great price! My favorite thing (aside from the freaking amazing tortillas) are the enchiladas. I try to always get one mild and one medium so I can have a good mix of green and red.   Here's a tip, if you want the crew to sing you a a little song, order the nachos!  They also cater, I have used them for past office meetings and they are very affordable and deliver right on time!"}
{"text":"I definitely love Café Rio, great quality of food at a reasonable price.  However.  This location is always very very busy, it is located close to ASU so if you come anytime between 11 AM and 2 PM, you're screwed.   I waited for 24 minutes in line just to place my order. Perhaps I am being nitpicky, but that is a really long time to wait in line simply to place an order. There was only one person at the cash register and she was very new. This held up the line considerably. My order was rang in incorrectly and cashed out l, then had to have a manager come over and fix it.  Line held up even longer.   Definitely will not be coming here during the lunch rush again. Had to take my food to go because I didn't have time to sit down and actually eat my meal... My salad will be soggy by the time I am able to have it for dinner a few hours from now.  I will note that they do have online ordering through through their app or online before you come to the restaurant. However, there is usually a 45 minute wait to pick up an online or app order, so if you don't plan ahead, this will not help you."}
{"text":"Lemme just start out by saying I didn't actually get any food. Buuuuuuuuuut I did use the pooper and I must say I am impressed(men's restroom). First things first the door wasn't one of those rickety lame doors it was solid. Secondly the lock wasn't one of those stupid button locks that just pushes in but doesn't actually lock anything, it's a straight up dead bolt bro. And it clicks in reeeeaaalll smooth...like butter. Now here's where they lost a star. There was some like paper towel and tp on the floor. Buuuut the seat was clean annnnnnnnd it flushed like a champ. Like it's one of those toilets that literally hydro blasts it with the might of Poseidon. And last but not least the cherry on top is the sink. It wasn't those sinks where you push it and there's like a 1 millisecond timer. It was an actual sink. All in all a solid pooping experience. God bless you on your endeavors friend."}
{"text":"Josue the manager appears to be fully incompetent.  He completely confused my order with the person behind me then took like five tries to clarify with him that I only ordered a salad.  I decide to give him a pass thinking he may of had a bad day and don't make any comments at the time.  This is after the new girl makes the skimpiest salad I've ever had here...  still I sit down without making any complaints yet.  Then I find out my tortilla is mostly raw...  I go up and ask for a manager, only to find out that the manager is the guy who originally couldn't get my order straight.  I show him my receipt and explain the tortilla was severely undercooked and parts of it looked like raw dough.  He them tells me that next time I am in to order my tortilla \"well done\"  umm I've never had to give specific instructions as if I am ordering a steak simply for a tortilla.  I had to ask him again to be sure he didn't offer to replace my meal or anything and reiterates that next time I should order my tortilla well done clearly saying he is going to do nothing in light of my issues.  I walk out shaking my head thinking that my tortilla should be thoroughly cooked without me having to make a special request that it be cooked properly and threw my receipt away to not come back again.  Now I am at home wondering if I should gag myself to barf this stomach ache out, thanks cafe Rio for the zero star waste of money stomach ache..."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio! My favorite is the shredded chicken salad with pinto beans. I always order an extra creamy dressing, it's amazing! I'm really glad cafe rio's in Arizona! Yay!  Food 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5- this place is really open, parking is great, and there's never a wait! Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Currently:  Sitting at my desk pouting because all day I was craving Mexican food and when everyone decided we were going to order from here for lunch I was so excited!! Unitil I got my burrito and took that first devastating bite...  I got the Pork burrito and it was absolutely disgusting. Like wow. Im so grossed out right now...  Instead of the beautiful blend of Mexican spices and flavors I got a sickly sweet burrito mess.  Now it could just be me. If you like really sweet burritos than this might be your thing. Its definitely not mine and i will sadly not be returning.  I knew we shouldve ordered from Chipotle...  *Insert sad face here*"}
{"text":"When I arrived the line was pretty long. Thankfully, service was fast and sped up my wait to the counter. There was also ample seating, as there was no competition for seating. I ordered the green chili taco with cheese. Pretty good, I liked the crunch in the tortilla and the juiciness of the pork. My only pet peeve would be the horchata. It tasted fairly watered down and did not have a distinct taste of cinnamon and vanilla. Otherwise, I will be returning to Café Río in the future. I also hope that they add taquitos and chimichangas to the menu in the future."}
{"text":"I have one problem with this location and if they fix it, this place would be outstanding. Next time you go in notice that no one on the line changes their gloves. Not when they touch their bodies or dirty aprons. Not when they constantly use a rag to wipe there area. It's like they put on one pair of gloves there entire shift. I'm not a food inspector but noticing behavior like that is pretty obvious and disgusting."}
{"text":"There were about 9 people working and only one woman was getting our food together. She was so insanely sweet, she was a short Hispanic girl but I could tell she was stressed because no one was helping her with the extremely long line. She kept looking around for help from her fellow employees and the others were laughing at her and joking around and literally standing around doing nothing. I only gave 2 stars for the one female that was getting our food together and had NO HELP in the insanely long line while the other employees laughed as she worked her butt off."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Where do we even start. We got there at about 420pm I ordered a sweet pork burrito. Well they didn't realize there was no sweet pork. The workers were hollering at each other about the pork then finally one said the last shift left then none. Unprofessional. My husband orders his food and was about to pay when he realized the worker has forgot the tortilla strips on his food and mentioned it and the worker threw it on his food and pushed it to the cashier. 10 mins goes by still no pork for my burrito. The workers were standing around laughing giggling and showed no concerns about me standing there. I was about to let them know to forget about it then pork was ready. The worker topping my food had an attitude and was just tossing food into my container. When we asked for a manager's card the cashier told us there wasn't one but told us his name is humberto but the supervisor was on duty. My husband asked who that was who does she point to? The worker that was throwing our toppings on to our food. Yep no thank you. It would of been  pointless to speak to her cause obviously she does not know how to run a shift and could care less of what her workers are doing. Unorganized and chaotic. Remind you we were the only two in line."}
{"text":"A little pricey considering all the other Mexican options out there.  Even with a BOGO coupon two burritos and a drink come to almost $14 !!  $2.19 for a drink seems a bit much.  They seemed slow and the workers not really attentive.  They half listen to you and mess up the order.  I think the team needs to work on service.  I also was a little ticked off that the whole time I was there they ran a blender - for like 15 minutes straight.  Seriously do the food prep before rush hour.  I am also offended by the up charge tactic of this chain.  Charging $1 extra for wet is fine, but the print is really small on the menu and when they ask if you want wet they never tell you it costs an extra buck per."}
{"text":"I liked this place. They are very fast and the food is fresh. I enjoyed watching the lady making the tortillas. We ordered nachos and 2 cheese enchiladas. They were both very good. The atmosphere is fun and chill. Something that did make me sick a little bit was that they didn't have soap in the bathroom and I was wondering if employees use the same bathroom..... iickkkk"}
{"text":"Unless it has new management, just get in your car and drive to the one off of Ann near Total Wine. Because the service here is almost always awful."}
{"text":"I have only been to Cafe Rio once. Wait, that isn't quite accurate... I have only EATEN at Cafe Rio once, at this location. I tried going to another location a while back while on my lunch break and ended up walking out due to a very long, slow moving line.   Allison S. and I were planning on getting some take out and decided to give the new neighborhood Cafe Rio a try. When we walked in the line was insane, but for how many people that were waiting to order and pay it moved fairly quickly. It took us about 25 minutes total to get through the line, order and pay. It was also quite loud, which made hearing the employee while ordering difficult.   I ended up ordering a grilled chicken salad. Not a fan of places like Cafe Rio that charge more for \"fire grilled chicken\" versus \"chicken\" but I still paid the extra buck to have fire-grilled chicken. As previously mentioned, the ordering process was chaotic so when asked, I said I'd take everything on the salad. Total damage for the salad only was a little over $10. A bit steep, but the serving was quite large.   The food itself was good. Not great. Comparable to Chipotle (which I am not a huge fan of either) or Qdoba (which I prefer to this). That said, I still plan on returning to try other menu items.  Hopefully by the time I return some of the 'new business in the area' hype has died down.  P.S. For whatever reason, this location isn't showing up on the website, so online ordering is not currently possible."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio - Centennial (2017 Yelp Review #237)  I gave up on In-N-Out for Lent.  So, you know what that means. That means I'm eating more chicken and salmon.  Café Rio has both.  My meals at Café Rio is a couple of servings of their Fire'd Grilled Chicken w/Cheese or a couple sides of their Salmon.  Don't expect too much from their salmon filets.  It's usually over-cooked and a lot of the nutrients is visibly cooked off.  Taste wise, it's okay.  I'll usually stick to just the chicken and cheese. This dish is very good and sure beats chicken breast from home.  You can also make it a \"healthier\" burrito by substituting their white tortilla with wheat.  Or, do what I do and just skip the starches and make it protein beast.  The ordering process is simple and quick.  The lines are rarely long and the staff is efficient.  I am a fan of Café Rio.  They have been a lifesaver during Lent."}
{"text":"I eat between 6-7 times per day during the week.  Eating the same meals daily is easy for me, but every once in a while I need a change from my boring chicken breast or lean ground beef. Café Rio is just one of the options I have when I'm looking for something good, cheap, and clean.  This Café Rio is conveniently located by one of my offices and it's never busy.  A typical order for me is 2-3 servings of their fire grilled chicken with nothing.  The serving size is really depends on their employees.  Some scoop a lot, some don't.  It really doesn't matter to me just as long as I'm getting about 10 oz. of meat.  You can really taste the quality of the chicken when it's prepped as plain as can be.  The chicken is pretty good and beats my chicken breast in a taste test any day.    TIP:  Café Rio is also known for their huge burritos and bowls.  2017 Yelp Review #65"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is everywhere in the valley.  Place is known for their Pork Barbacoa, but I don't prefer pork so I couldn't start my review on how great that was.    What I can comment on.. -Nachos:  Missing San Diego, I had them create nachos with just sour cream, double chicken, and cheese.  I have to say, one of the best 2000 calories i consumed in one time in a along time.  -Burritos:  Kept it simple again.  Just the chicken and rice.  I'm not really into the messy wet burritio so I had them just add a small amount.    Portions are huge and the meals are delicious.  Service is a quick cafeteria/assembly line type ordering. I like it.  At least you can see exactly how your food is being prepared.   TIP:  Get your side sauces before you pay or while you are ordering.  They never ask if you need any and there isn't any in the condiment area or tables."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I've never been to a Cafe Rio until I moved to Las Vegas over 5 years ago. I wasn't originally a fan because I was a Chipotle Die-Hard. That was then, this is now. I now dine at a Cafe Rio at least once a month because it's convenient, the food is pretty good, and I can make their meals as healthy or unhealthy as I want. I rarely go to this location because there's just so many other options off Eastern Ave.  If I do come here, it's usually with a co-worker. My co-worker is on a health kick recently. I think he's one of those New Year Resolutioners. He wanted something \"clean\". Clean to him is switching from a Barbacoa Enchilada Burrito to a Chicken Enchilada Burrito with all the fun stuff. He obviously loves Cafe Rio because he always picks this place. I don't share his enthusiasm towards Cafe Rio, but I am a fan. I always get the same thing at a Cafe Rio and that's 2-3 servings of their Fire Grilled Chicken with Cheese. I don't put any of the sauces and usually skip the tortilla. The meal is a lot better than plain chicken breast that's for sure. The portions are huge only because I request extra meat. Overall, I have no issues with the food and will continue to dine here.  TIP #1: This restaurant always seems to be busy regardless of the time.   TIP #2:  Wheat tortilla on request only  TIP #3:  The entire staff will yell \"Extra Meat\" if decide to pile it on. Look up the Cafe Rio Extra Meat Legend on YouTube. Hilarious! I want extra meat!! Extra Meat!!!  2017 Yelp Review #121   Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Placed a $90 order for 9 people. Got home and two meals were missing. Called back and let them know what was missing. Showed up and they hadn't made it but instead argued with us about it then charged us for their mistake. Asked for a discount and they spoke back and forth in front of us in Spanish for about 30 seconds and then replied, \"we don't give discounts.\" Very rude and disrespectful about the whole situation. Clearly Cafe Rio doesn't have customer service training.  Will never return and will never recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio...First of all I would like to say that I do not typically leave reviews. Waaaaay overpriced for the amount of food that they give you! We paid $37 for 4 burritos and drinks. Could have had burritos at Los Fav's on Cooper & Ray for half the price! The girl making the food was trying to rush us when there wasn't anyone else in line. We asked for shredded beef & they said we would have to wait an additional 15 for it to be cooked. Shouldn't they have this type of food available and ready if it's on the menu? They could have at least dried off the trays before putting all of our food on em & serving us. Two employees were throwing water bottles at each other in the dining area where the customers eat. Very unprofessional!! Extremely dissatisfied!! We will never return here!!!"}
{"text":"With the recent heartbreak of Chipotle, I've been turning to my second favorite fast food Mexican joint -- Cafe Rio. It's solid fare and value prices. My top choices are the salad with chicken and the fire grilled burrito.  Best of all, I'm unaware of any side servings of food borne illness."}
{"text":"The food was decent we ordered tacos queso and chips and a side of meat food delivery yet we didn't get that chips and K so that we paid for and when I called to ask about it I was told to come and pick them up I had to explain the point of delivery it was that I did not want to come up there will not order from there again although they never  sent the queso and chips"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this location gets ZERO stars from us. Café Rio is one of my family's favorite places to dine, after numerous unpleasant & unprofessional visits, there is absolutely no way I will bring my family here any more.  We call in our orders to avoid the line and even if they tell you the wait is 10-30 minutes, they don't even start preparing your order until you arrive to pick it up. It's happened multiple times.  The cashier is always rude to my husband about having extra side dishes. She has told us that they aren't allowed to give extra Tortilla strips, and sauces. And the other staff tells us that's not a real rule. And we obviously know it costs more for extras. Just charge us the extra and let us have our meal the way we eat it please! I don't understand why they are so rude, and feel the need to make it clear they absolutely hate working there. It's too bad because it definitely used to be a family favorite. But 9/10 times it's a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I live this location but tonight I stopped by to buy dinner at 7:45 and they had closed. No signage for the early closure. At least the place next to them said closed for Easter."}
{"text":"It was a hit and miss.  My son loves it but I personally prefer Chipotle.  My son ordered the Tostada all the times.  My cousin ordered the kid quesadilla but now they stopped coming here because they were sick of the food here. They have a lot of turn over, some servers now what to do, some don't. Check your receipts too."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible, we are party of two and we get only one napkin cuz they don't have to many, only a few left, really?, they prepare the food the way they wanted no the way I want like the guacamole outside the burrito not inside like I want, plus they cover the outside with guacamole, bad experience"}
{"text":"Apathetic service, dirty restaurant, stale tostada, low employee morale, lack of training, CHINTZY with the guac, circulating drink dispenser was just sitting turned off, yet half full. The list goes on and so should you. I didn't want to put too much effort into this review, because it isn't worth it to help businesses that don't want to improve.   If someone could get a Chipotle open in this neighborhood, it would be much appreciated and frequented. The food was not one star, but the experience as a whole will ensure that I savage them anytime their name comes up. Life is too short for mediocre, and I like supporting businesses that like to be in business."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is my absolute favorite I'm even a rewards member but every single time I come to this particular location... I hate it so much , I always get the same thing & every single time they give me rice they literally give me a table spoon of rice , even when I request more & willing to pay extra ... super stingy with their rice & it's really my favorite part about the meal , I keep giving them another chance & then get disappointed all over again so I decided to leave a review this time & just won't come to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Better than your average fast food mexican place but not the greatest.  I do love their drink selection though.  It's good when time and money is limited."}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars if there was a clean table when it was time to sit down.  Ordered the nachos and first off they sang a song as soon I ordered them which was a nice touch.  Then the nachos were very high quality.  I plan on coming back to enjoy some more of the green chile pork nachos."}
{"text":"The food here is standard Cafe Rio fare -- bland, fresh, and high quality -- but the one star rating is deserved because this restaurant CAN NOT handle any type of crowd. The lines here are outrageous and I agree with the other recent reviews. PLEASE, corporate, PAY ATTENTION AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LOCATION!  It wasn't always like this. Cafe Rio was a quick and easy place to grab a business lunch or to get takeout on the way home from a long day at work. No longer. After my most recent visit 2 nights ago (and a nearly 45 minute wait in line at 8 pm!!), I will now not only actively avoid dining here, but I will be sure to spread the word to everyone I know.   People are not exaggerating about the wait times. The problem is, you never know just how long the queue will take when you line up. The employees are so slow and nobody tries to expedite the line. Cafe Rio is supposed to be a \"quick service\" restaurant but now it's anything but.   There's no excuse. Zero. Zip. None.   All I can figure is that Cafe Rio corporate and this location's manager just don't give a crap about losing customers.   We used to go at least twice a week. Then that whittled down to once a week, then a couple of times a month then about once a month. Now it's gone to none.   Maybe that's your plan, to get people to stop coming to your restaurant so the line will move quicker. Congrats, Cafe Rio! Here's to at least two other people (as well as all of our friends and coworkers) who will never set foot in your restaurant again."}
{"text":"Came in HUNGRY!  It's our first visit here and they killed it! This place is great! I had the pork quesadilla, my hubby had the pulled chicken enchiladas!  Both were fantastic! We have had friends tell us it was good food and man were they right!  Flavorful without all the grease, made to order right in front of you with obviously fresh ingredients.  Go try it ASAP!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of cafe Rio but when my husband brought me home my favorite tacos tonight I was soooooo disappointed. I have never seen such a pathetic taco in my life."}
{"text":"This is the WORST expierence and decent. If I could give zero stars I would. This is my first and last time I'll be visiting this chain. When it was my turn in line I was still behind the wall and the guy asked what I wanted. At least that's what I assumed because I couldn't hear him. I told him 2 steak burritos and he asked something but I couldn't understand. I asked him what he said, but he turned his head away from me and repeated himself to where I couldn't understand him. When I apologized and said I couldn't hear him he had the worst snappy attitude and asked what sauce I wanted. I tod him \"I guess hot\" this was my first time and I had no idea how it worked or what my options were. I like lettuce, pico, guac, sour creme on the inside but I didn't have that option. My burritos were rolled and finished. When they came out of the heater thing another lady asked what I wanted. So all the stuff was on the outside?!?! That didn't make sense. I should have just ordered a salad. When I got my food it was cold. Had decent flavor, but was disappointed. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I have never written such a long review!!   I went to this location as I am from out of town and I LOVE CAFE RIO!!!! If I could give 1 star I would.   First off I entered the restaurant at 8pm on Saturday.  I was the only one in line and was not acknowledged for a few minutes.  I stood by the tortilla station waiting for the tortilla maker to at least say hello... nothing.  The line person had her back to me cleaning the roll covers for near the grill with a dirty towel.  Another team member walked towards her and motioned for her to acknowledge me.  She turned around from her cleaning duty and placed her hand in the tortilla bag and asked what she could make for me. I asked, are you going to change your gloves? ( she was cleaning) She rolled her eyes and said,\"yes, you haven't ordered yet\"  I then said never mind and started to walk away.  I quickly turned and asked if the GM is available, They pointed at a lady in the back holding a clip board and a hood over her head, and said shes busy. I was very uncomfortable with at this point at least 4 employees staring at me so I said never mind and walked out of the restaurant.  I immediately called the restaurant from my car.  I was very upset with the way I was treated.    A Male employee answered, I asked for the manager and he replied,\" for what reason?\" I said I would discuss that with the manager.  He took the phone away from his face and said, \" Hey, Im pretty sure that this is the lady that just walked out.\" I watched as all the employees gathered around the front counter as well as the GM.  I watched this from my car.  The GM directed the Male employee to respond to me and he gets back on the phone and tells me, \" Shes busy with a customer right now, can I help you with something?\"  There were NO other customers... I was watching this all transpire through the front windows.  I was very disappointing, and not what I expect from Cafe Rio!   I visit many Cafe Rio's on my travels. I seek them out!! I have been to ones in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California and have never had such a bad experience!  I will be sharing this with my colleges, and will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Come here often when I travel...First time at night, it was 8:20 on a Sunday. Food is always great however  EMPLOYEES were more worried about closing than the guests. More worried about cleaning than helping guests felt I was a huge inconvenience to them. Next time will choose another option in the area at night as there are plenty! Also observed employees eating and drinking on the line.  I wont be back!"}
{"text":"It really isn't as great or high praised as people make it seem. It's expensive for the little food they give you. They give you little food, and hella lettuce to make it look big and full but it really isnt a lot. Youll get full off the lettuce alone and even then theres so little rice and beans that you'll be able to eat that too. Its very loud incredibly crowded and busy. If you do get the nachos, it seems to be the only thing they actually give you a lot of."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is cafe rio- it is delicious. This location though is absolutely terrible. They hire their employees straight from the gutter. None of them can smile, they all argue at each other in front of customers and are just rude. Guy asking if I want rice and beans and he's already putting them on my salad and gets irritated when I say no rice.. like it's an inconvenience he jumped ahead of himself on something I didn't want. If I didn't love the food so much I would never be back, but luckily for me there are other better locations. This one takes the cake for the worst Cafe rio location in vegas."}
{"text":"I'm never coming here again the staff is trash and the food doesn't even taste good. I came in so happy and left so disappointed. I was so excited to try Cafe Rio but their service is sooooo bad. No one smiles. No one welcomes you. Once you step on the line they're bothered you even entered to eat there. They don't care if they drown your burrito with salsa or if they even get your order right. I really hate this place and I'm never coming again. I'm never bringing my family here or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Don't like this place at all. I gave it a few tries and I came to the conclusion that this place is just horrible. Whenever I come in here, it seems so chaotic behind the counter that it seems like they rush you. I prefer Chipotle or Qdoba instead."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience. Do not go here if you don't want to spend an hour waiting in line.  They need better staffing and better organization. The fact that I had to wait in line for 43 minutes just amazes me. Also the man who made my burrito kept wiping his sweat off his face most likely on my food. Gross.  Online orders shouldn't come first before customers in front of your face. Better off going to chipotle I guess."}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall. Really great queso!"}
{"text":"It's really like an upscale Chipotle, with a larger menu.  The queso is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Love Cafe Rio!!!! Compare to the on on Blue Diamond which is the worst place I've been too. I love going to the one near Ann Rd. The service is fast even when busy, the employees is helpful, nice and they never seem to run out of the queso cheese dip (my daughters favorite... She dips her quesadilla in it)."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and I'm so happy we have one in our area now! However I feel that this location is a bit stingy on the meat in the burritos... I wouldn't call this a bad experience, just a little disappointing :("}
{"text":"This location is THE WORST. They \"take orders over the phone\" and yet the order is NEVER ready in the time they say it will be. You get there and people come, order and leave BEFORE you even get your food and even then the order is wrong 90% of the time.  I've experienced this COUNTLESS number of times. I keep hoping it won't happen again and it does. I will never go back to this location. Ever again."}
{"text":"horrible customer service!! one girl taking my order couldn't even hear my order because she was too busy having a conversation with other employees about jow she is supposed to be off already. three times i repeated my order. everyone in the line up has an attitude!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Cafe Rio I had called in a to go order for 2 of the popular pork salad. Needless to say I didn't go back until tonight (after 4 months) because we were so disappointed in our skimpy and I do mean skimpy salads, they were 1/2 the size of the ones we'd had the week before. I decided since I was in the area I'd give it another shot. I'm glad I did! It's piled with rice, black beans and for once plenty of pork! I even had to ask the girl making it to remove some of the huge pieces of lettuce as it was way too much for me! I'll probably have leftovers for tomorrow! I hope it's this way again when I return for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, overall decent experience, the put effort into the decor of the place, the way the place is decorated gives it a cool factor.  It's similar to going to a Mexican chain place for a burrito or salad.  Ingredients are fresh, The service is ok at best.  I can't understand the staff, heavy accents, it has potential to be homey and more hospitality driven, just not there yet."}
{"text":"Meh. For a Cafe Rio this place is just OK. They are new and still getting their stuff together, I will try again in a few months once they deal with their growing pains.  The restaurant is modern and nice, but when I visited the line was long, the restroom was dirty, and the food wasn't Cafe Rio quality.   We will visit again in a few months because we know the quality that is normal for Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Best fast mexican food ever. High quality, great taste, decent prices, nice crew. Note, the medium sauce on the enchiladas is a tad bit sweet, I go for the hot sauce which isnt very hot."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Cafe Rio for the first time. Wow, it's really hard to argue with just north of $6 for a gigantic, filling lunch.  We got here a little before noon. Found out later that we were lucky enough to dodge the peak lunch hour line. Holy crap.  I went with the daily special, which was a chicken tostada salad. It was really nice. I picked the pinto beans and gave them the okay to put \"everything\" on it, and it certainly seemed like they did. A tortilla at the bottom of the plate, a whole mess of salad, a solid helping of chicken, a bunch of tostada strips, a gob of sour cream, half of a lime, and the amazing cilantro lime \"vinaigrette\" that was definitely more of a dressing. Everything worked very well together and nothing was bland or overly salty. Oh, and I got a drink with the cost of the special, and I picked the strawberry lemonade with stevia sweetener to save on calories.  I'll definitely come back and try the other specials, and I may look into some of the regular menu items too. This is well worth a visit at non-peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and well worth a visit. I'm hoping for a franchise in Indiana!"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio but this location was very disappointing. The staff was very rude and the salad that I ordered comes with cheese but the guy only gave me a pinch and told me if I wanted more than that it would cost $1 more. The other locations give you cheese and don't argue with their customers over it. Then I asked for limes and they gave me lemons instead and when I told then, he rolled his eyes at me, like really. This location is very stingy with their ingredients and the staff have poor attitudes. I Will NEVER be back to this location EVER again and I have advised several others to go to a different location so they don't go through the same hassle I did. Lack of customer service is prevalent here. FYI: If you hate your job that much that you treat your customers like shit, then quit your job. Management shouldn't allow this to happen, PERIOD!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Please explain why there are only 2 people working the line. This has to be the slowest Cafe Rio ever! I'm writing this while waiting in line. The staff seem super unmotivated and like they could give a crap. Worst location ever!"}
{"text":"Everything's good about this place. The people are cool and they are nice.  Food taste good and the line moves. Right outside the gym so a lot of sweaty funky people come in there and you need the line to move to not inhale fumes of cardio !!!"}
{"text":"I love the portion size here...they haven't done what so many chains have done, which is less food for more money.  I can still share an entree with my hubby and we always order the chips with the queso and salsa.  Also love that they have a daily special here.  Service for us has been hit or miss but overall it's been ok."}
{"text":"Updated review: My daughter asked me to take her to Cafe Rio this afternoon for chips and queso. I'm actually glad I did. You can tell service has improved. Had the enchiladas with shredded beef and I'll admit it was great. She's a cheese quesadilla kind of kid but she decided to try the shredded beef burrito and loved it. I'm happy she found something she really liked besides just queso or quesadillas. The cashier to was extremely kind and even offered us a veterans discount to my surprise. That actually made my day to be recognized for my prior service. Thank you CR! Five stars for looking out for our service members, Vets, Fire Men/Women and Police Officers."}
{"text":"I got the tostada bowl and wasn't too impressed. The tostada wasn't what I expected with a flat round on the bottom. The chicken is way too spicy for my liking. Guac is also over spiced. Skimpy on filling the bowl but over flows with lettuce unlike other locations. Gave us a punch card but didn't fill it out for today's order. I'll stop by again in a few months after the newness wares off."}
{"text":"Warning- if you're vegan or lactose intolerant this location just dumps ingredients on your order without permission. I threw out my order after I found cheese in my vegan salad. They also wrapped up my boyfriends burrito before he could ask for anything other than rice and beans and poured enchilada sauce on it that he didn't want. I suggest going elsewhere if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service. Can't beat the price. They do however charge extra for everything. I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place always packed cause irs good just wish it wasnt always so packed so there is a small down side to this place easy quick menu always with a todays special."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Cafe Rio restaurants since 2001 when they had two or three of them (in Utah), and was happy to find one nearby upon moving to Henderson.  I have to say that I continue to be impressed by the consistently good quality and reasonably priced food.  My favorite is the chicken salad with house (tomatillo) dressing - hard to order anything else.  Their flour tortillas are wonderful.  The portions of ingredients in the salad are generous and if I separate things into multiple containers (to keep the cooked stuff from wilting the lettuce) as soon as I get home, I can usually get 3 meals out of just one Cafe Rio chicken salad.  This is literally the only place I have ever completed a frequent buyer card - and I have completed quite a few over the years.   I normally choose mom an pop places over either fast food or any chain restaurants, but I make an exception for this one.  I like that if I'm hungry when I walk in the door, even with a line of people, I can be seated and eating in about five minutes.  I give five stars for combination of value for the money, good tasting food, friendly employees, and upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Heard about place while having a discussion with a co-worker about chipotle. He raved about it so gave it a try...huge regret. Besides the tortilla being better than chipotle, everything else was not. Ordered the chicken burrito with salad and guac on the side. The only thing I tasted was SALT. Seems like whoever cooked the food went salt crazy. Definitely would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied when I come here  (which is at least twice a month). The sweet pork is the best. Great food for the price. I also like their rewards program."}
{"text":"Really good food. The only thing is that their famous mint lemonade is almost always empty. Every time we go we get the last little drops. Other than that it's really good, love the homemade tortillas on the salad bowls!"}
{"text":"Do you like waiting in long lines? Well then Cafe Rio is the place for you. One of the trashiest restaurants I have eaten at in a while. It is completely horrible. It is not even real Mexican food. I tried the Chicken Quesadilla. After eating that I began to contemplate all other future decisions I will make when in life. It was terrible. I could not tell if there was cheese in it or if they just decided to make it even worse by not adding cheese. The staff is terrible. They stare at you like prisoners and watch you while you make an order. There was so much trash on the floor I thought I could have been on the slums of Mexico. The person that was supposed to be cleaning ended up getting side tracked and talking to a friend that was eating there. I go there not to be reminded of my lack of friends due to employees like this. If you enjoy eating off a menu with a lack of options, food with no real beef, and horrible hygiene then I recommend you eat at Cafe Rio and even try licking the ground because it is just \"spotless\"!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Cafe Rios food. I have had no issues with the food itself. I have gone on occasion to this location for lunch during a work day. I purposely don't go during the lunch rush, more like 2pm and the past two times have had seriously long wait times. Both times I have waited in line for approximately 30 minutes. In my opinion even though the food is fresh, it's is made in an assembly line process and this length of time to wait is unacceptable. The line corral was only filled half way both times. Sadly I will have to only have cafe rio on my days off and not this location."}
{"text":"Just walked out after standing in line for 30min and it didn't move 6feet. The restaurant  will need to figure out how to move people faster so that it doesn't take their whole lunch break just to stand in line."}
{"text":"Sloooowwww line.  Twice I have been here, and both times, line has been extremely slow.  BUT the food is fantastic.  8 people in line, and took 20 mins to get through line.  Very slow.  I will avoid this location in future, and go to other Cafe Rios.  I will update some time inthe future."}
{"text":"Why do everyone think they're a food critic? I don't care about ambience or 'friendliness.' It's all about the food & price!  Cafe Rio is pricey but they deliver.  Ask for chips & pico de gallo. Sweet pork burrito enchilada style is the best here."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Cafe Rio but I thought I should give it another try.  It had been a few years though and I was not entirely sure what I was doing when I walked in.  Originally I was planning on getting a burrito but I reconsidered and thought I'd brach out and get enchiladas instead.  I wanted two.  One with the shredded chicken and one with shredded beef.  When the slow line I was in moved enough that I made it up to the counter I ordered two enchiladas.  I thought the lady working behind the counter asked me what beans I wanted to which I replied \"black beans.\"  Next thing I know she is filling my tortillas with beans and cheese and putting them in the oven.  Whoa! Time out. I wanted meat in those things.  I stopped them before they got too far and explained that I wanted meat in my enchiladas.  I apologized for the confusion.  I could tell she was as frustrated with me as I was with her.  She explained that the black beans I wanted come on the side.  I didn't see that there was another vat of beans further down the line.  Anyhow, she asked one of the other workers to throw away the mistakes and proceeded to make my two enchiladas with shredded beef without actually asking me what meat I wanted.  I didn't want to continue making a scene so I just let it go.  I was going to get one enchilada with shredded beef any how.  Two is fine too.  So with a double dousing of medium sauce, my enchiladas were in the oven.  It took a few more minutes before I made it down to where I was to receive my rice and black beans.  A scoop of rice.  A scoop of soupy beans and my meal was complete.  I took it all home to eat.  I'm not going to say that was a mistake but with all the sauce and soupy beans in my flimsy aluminum bowl/plate, I am thankful for the bag they gave me.  That stuff was starting to leak out over the edges on the drive home.  The mess didn't end there.  Trying to eat what was now effectively an enchilada stew from the aforementioned flimsy aluminum bowl/plate was an adventure in and of itself.  That thing has no structural integrity whatsoever.  You try to cut your enchilada, burrito, etc and the bowl just crumples and bends into a wadded mass of metal.  So irritating.  When all is said and done, eaten and gone, the experience of going to Cafe Rio was frustrating.  And to add to that frustration, I wanted so badly to be mad at the food too so I would not be tempted to come back and experience it again.  But for all of its soupy mess, the flavors were quite nice.  There was a fair amount beef in my enchiladas and the medium sauce did not overwhelm the pallate.  I'll give them that.  But I am still not a huge fan.  Cafe Rio is just not my plate of beans."}
{"text":"I am struggling to find the positives in Cafe Rio.  Since I have no issues listing the negatives, I'll start there.  First, the interior of the restaurant.  I appreciate what it wants to be looking kind of beach shack meets TexMex but seating is an issue.  There is plenty of it but the restaurant is not big enough.  People are squeezing between chairs and walls just to get to one of the few available tables.  Not too comfortable.  I have a problem with the menu too.  It lists the options and gives a price but not much else.  It gives a starting price and shows you meat options but most options are an extra charge.  What I really wanted would have brought my burrito and fountain drink to well over $10.  For a fast food place? Get real.  So I got the pulled chicken because it was cheaper.  I was disappointed with it.  The chicken was too salty.  The beans in my burrito were good but the rice reminded me of cheap instant rice.  It was not as good as the rice at Chipotle.  The burrito on the whole was alright.  It was big and filling though I've tasted better.  Furthermore, I like to be able to pick up  my burritos and eat with my hands.  I cannot do that at Cafe Rio.  The burritos are rolled loose and are rather saucey.  Too hard to eat with the hands, that is for sure.  On to the positives.  I like the ice at the soda fountain.  And the iced tea was good.  As I mentioned before, the burrito was filling.  That is a mark in the win column.  I like that the tortillas and most everything else is made fresh.  I like that you can see it being made fresh.  Overall, this is not my favorite place for a burrito.  I would rather go to Chipotle or Q'Doba.  In my opinion, they are better and even a little more affordable."}
{"text":"Chicken Tostada is currently the special on Wednesdays.  I love their Chicken Tostadas so much that I now call Wednesday...\"Chicken Tostada Wednesdays\"!!!  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  I'm pretty sure if I could I'd eat here every day!  Tortillas taste homemade.  Salsas and meats taste so fresh.  This has to be my favorite \"fast food\" Mexican place in town.  Love it!  If you're not a fan of the tostada, try the Chicken Quesadilla!  To die for!  Tacos are really good too!  And get a punch card...after the 10th punch you get a free meal!  YAY!"}
{"text":"I probably go to this place too much!  But it's sooooo good!  The tortillas are wonderul!  Everything I've ever had there is delicious!  When I first started going there I was hooked on their quesadillas....now I'm loving their tostadas!  If you like their salads, you'll like the tostadas too.  They are really similar, only the tostada doesn't have the tortilla shell as the salad bowl.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The meats there are so tender and flavorful.  And their guacamole is really, really good!  The same can be said of their chips and salsa, queso dip and pretty much everything else.  Tasty all the way around!"}
{"text":"Normally I'd like to give these guys a better score than 3 stars. But the staff here is kinda slacking. Food is always up to par, just what your looking for if you've eat'n here before. But several times I've gone in to lines of customers that aren't moving because the staff is very disorganized. I've watched them hold up 10 customers while one girl worked on a call in order of 6 meals while other staff stood around talking. Then finally washed their hands and walked over to help. The cash register is also a bottle neck.   So food is good, service not so good."}
{"text":"For whatever reason the PTO moms always pick this place and today after our mornings of school volunteering they wanted to go.  I rarely eat here, but something about their wet burrito makes me say yes when invited. I usually get it with shredded chicken, red sauce on top and no cheese or sour cream.  Today my food was fine, service was fine, however the PTO moms I was with were fit to be tied when the normal medium salsa was not yet prepared at 11:30. I think it was more the attitude of indifference that irritated them. Anyhoo, they definitely were not pleased.  Items ordered were my chicken burrito, a shredded chicken tostada salad and a shredded chicken enchilada style burrito (sin desired salsa).   I would definitely go again to Cafe Rio. Even though my PTO mom pals were pissed, I like their shredded pollo, es muy delisioso. I think I prefer Chipotle, as does my kids, but it's still good. My burrito and a fountain drink was $11 something."}
{"text":"This particular Cafe Rio is ghetto. The tables weren't clean. The outside patio has broken umbrellas which means you can't sit outside in the nice weather. The staff is rude when ordering and one employee was fixing himself a drink at the fountain and forced me to wait on him. The food itself was about the same as the others but I had to guess which burrito was mine because he didn't mark it on top with the meat like they normally do. Go to another cafe rio instead."}
{"text":"always super fast, always super friendly.  Sweat Sweat Pork Barbacoa Burrito Enchilada style!"}
{"text":"The food is really good the salad with both dressings is AMAZING!!! The fresh hand made tortillas are also really good. I love that they have a little free casadilla for kids. It's the perfect amount for the picky eaters. The reason for the 2 stars is Evey. Single. Time. we are there the service is absolutely AWFUL. The staff is so rude. It's like they try to be even more rude every single time. I only ever go back because it's so good. We've actually started driving out to other locations to get better service. Tried doing phone orders and it's worse. If you are up for great food go for it if you can handle the bad service."}
{"text":"Homemade taste, restaurant quality. Salsa is one of the best anywhere"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I couldn't be more disappointed in this location I have left yet again without food. I called in my order for to go since this location is very busy and it takes about 40 minutes to get your food in the line or more, so I called in at 6:35 p.m. I got to the location at 6:55 p.m. and was told I was 30 minutes early for my pickup order. I attend the Phoenix location on Camelback and 20th three times a week I place a to-go order two out of the three times never have I ever been told it was going to be over 30 minutes for me to get my to-go order. I will never absolutely never attended this location again. If you read my previous review you will see that I have left numerous times due to poor management and food not being ready well read it you can see for yourself. Not to say the girl wasn't pleasant and explaining to me but the fact that she even has to explain that is outrageous to me period when you have to-go orders you should have people working to go and people working the line. But I was told we have to serve the other customers first. Now this is just terrible management being a manager myself I would never set my associate's up for failure. Now I love Cafe Rio but I do not love this location and I will not be back"}
{"text":"I eat A LOT of Cafe Rio, but this location is one of the best I've been too. There is never a long wait, the staff is always friendly, and the food is amazing. They also do a great job making sure the drink bar is always full and the restaurant is kept clean."}
{"text":"Food and service was not on par. I first started coming here in 2010, and the food was the best. Staffs were not attentive to serving food. The place smelt like wet rag. Utensils and napkins were not fully stocked. Rice was undercooked and by the time I ate it, the food was no longer warm. Overall, the food was not the same quality as it used to be. Very disapponted."}
{"text":"First time Cafe Rio-er & wow oh wow and I pleasantly surprised. We took advantage of the BOGO deal they had going on for opening week. Both me & my boyfriend got bowls with double meat ( they charge a little under 3$ for extra meat).   They MELT your cheese, talk about an amazing little perk! Gone are the days of cold, stiff cheese mixed in to my chipotle bowls.   And the tortillas are HOMEMADE. This adorable lady was making them as I was ordering & they are fantastic and delicious and life changing.   The sweet pork is my favorite meat, full of flavor and tender. The steak was also fantastic! Grilled to perfection with no fat.   It is a little pricey, bowls usually come to around 10$ after tax... but you do get a lot of food!"}
{"text":"They have some really good food. I've thoroughly enjoyed every meal I've eaten here. The only issues are how slow the line moves and for some reason they randomly break out into shouting a few different chants. Ones about being a \"nacho man\" and then another is just about cafe rio. It's super annoying and the do it so loud. Most people here during lunch are trying to take a break from work. It didn't seem like anyone in the store was happy about the yelling matches that took place every 5 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Their quesadillas are sooo good, so is the salad, you can't go wrong with any combination of meats and sauces. I recommend the mint lemonade, I get one every time I stop in. They have frequent diner stamp cards so pick one up and get started :)"}
{"text":"I could eat the salads all day long, every day, every week, every year & washing it down with their Raspberry Lemon Lime drink. Hands down the best food ever invented. Thank you Utah for handing us Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"The steak burrito Enchilada style is my favorite. I order it even time I come here! They also have really good in house drink choice. My favorite is the southwest limeade with hibiscus (turns your tongue red though, lol)."}
{"text":"I've been going to cafe rio for a few years. Tonight I went and ordered a pork quesadilla with extra meat for a first time. I had ordered it to go and when I got home to open it I was very disappointed. They put meat inside, but seemed to have no cheese so the  tortillas didn't stick together and meat fell out everywhere. They never cut it into pieces so I had to use a knife and fork to cut the whole thing apart. It looked so unappetizing and looked like an open face taco, not a quesadilla. Very disappointed they would serve this."}
{"text":"Love the food. Service is slow, and they never have tres leches dessert in stock when i come. They are always out of something.  Besides that, the food is good but expect to wait forever and deal with slow employees and long lines.  I would come here more if it was quicker and more convenient then having to wait 40 min in line.  Heres the deal... Ive been here at least 5 times and EVERY time i come no matter the hour its too packed and its frustrating.  So frustrating that i had time to pull out my iphone and write this review! Haha.... Lame."}
{"text":"3 steak tacos for $12.12? Are you serious? These prices are a crime! Never again! Especially if the pico is all soggy. The dude grabs my tacos and puts the pico on them loaded with all the liquid? Is this guy new? Come on bro! You don't do that! Oh and I get my receipt and my bottle Coke says \"Mexican Coke\"???? It's a bottle of Coke people!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first because I am accustomed to good Mexican food coming from California. The grilled chicken salad was delicious especially topped off with the tomatillo dressing. Green & creamy is the one you want. The staff was friendly and even hooked it up with a free drink since they put pulled chicken in my salad when I wanted the grilled."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! Instead of just waiting in line to place my order, we were able to watch the tortilla making process.   There were two ladies making the tortillas right there in front of us. One mixed the dough, while the other rolled it out and placed it on a spinning flat cook top. Once the tortillas were done, they were then stacked and ready to be used for burritos and quesadillas. Talk about fresh!  We paid an extra dollar for their Fire Grilled Chicken, and got the burrito. My husband loves heat, and asked for the hottest salsa, as well as 'enchilada style' with their green sauce. I love melted cheese and smothered burritos. Yum! They added greens and pico de gallo on the side. We took this home, and my husband and I split it.   The burrito was very flavorful, and large enough for the two of us to share. Even though he asked for the hottest salsa, it was tame enough for me to eat it with no problem...and I am a wimp when it comes to heat. I admit that I had been nervous when he asked for the hot salsa, but I need not have worried. We will definitely be back. Next time, I want to try the horchata as it has been way too many years since I have had any."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I've ever received. Second in line and it took them 15 minutes to get to me only to find out it would take them another 15 minutes to cook my order. Also, the restaurant was filthy. The glass that acts as barrier between the food and customer made me cringe. Overall very disappointed and don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked into cafe rio happy and hungry.   Ordering was just fine until we got to the end and the name of Leslie was just straight up ridiculous. We were here ordering our food, waiting on the burrito, Pork Barcacoa Quesadilla, and a steak salad. Me and my friend her that the pork quesadilla was right in front of her, and said \"no its grilled chicken\"she had to turn her head to the others that worked there and asked \"where's the pork quesadilla\". Of course they all said \"the one in front of you is a pork quesadilla\" after 5 minutes of arguing with her that it's PORK not chicken, she finally said \"you guys are right\" and slightly rolled her eyes. What kind of employee rolls their eyes at a customer? Last time I checked, working as customer service shouldn't first of all fight with their customers then rolled their eyes. Bad customer service. Not just that, they ran out of steak (okay I understand, steak is popular) so we were waiting 15 minutes while our burrito and pork quesadilla was already done. Not to mention, we've been told Leslie isn't everyone favorite around there.  We went home, all happy our food is here, when I look at the salad, they didn't give me my dressing on the side. Now there goes another 15 minutes going to waste  man o man, I love this place sooo much"}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is on the ball, they may not have a standing counter for pick ups but they had my order ready. This is the first cafe Rio that had my order ready and it was correct, I'll be back to this one.  I do alot of food orders for my customers for lunch n learns and I know I'll be back using this Cafe Rio but as for 4 others I've used in the valley I'll tell my customers they r not an option. This Cafe Rio nice employee's, clean place and on the ball. Thank you Cafe Rio employee's at this location u made my day."}
{"text":"This place has changed. I had a lunch to do today and placed my order over the phone picked it up and not only was my order ready early but they also gave me a discount. April H checked me out and she was the nicest. Very nice and polite. I'll be back Thank you April H."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing. This girl must have been the manager or something because she had people moving around in this restaurant getting stuff done. So from a previous cafe Rio experience (like last week) I placed an order on line went to pick it up a half hr early or at least make sure it would be ready by my pick up time and give me some time to eat my lunch before taking lunch to my customer. Ling store short my order was not ready when I got there and it was not ready when I asked for it to be ready so thinking this restaurant might be the same i showed up to this one 15mins early and again my order was not ready but it was not because they were behind it was because the printer was not printing the on-line orders.  So the amazing part here is i had 5 meals and they got them ready two mins before by 11am pick-up. They were fast. This girl working this location needs to go over to the other location i was last week and get them in order."}
{"text":"Another cafe Rio fail.  This is the third cafe Rio I have gone to expecting my Very large order for my customers is not ready when I requested it. If they open up to the public at 10:30 am and was just told they do not even start their line until 10:20 am then on the website u should not be able to order until 11 am. Sounds like someone needs to change the web site because they could never have an order ready by 10:30 AM. I am just going to start telling my customers that want lunch by 11 no cafe Rio and start ordering from another place someone who is open early enough to help me w/my customer lunch n learns. The women that looked to be the manager was rude instead of saying we cannot do this she should have explained it to me then said we r working on and we will get it done as fast as we can. But instead she was loud about and the girl (who was nice that greeted me) told me."}
{"text":"Called in a lunch order at 11AM, was immediately put on hold. When I told him that I had an order for 8 meals, I was told \"oh, I guess I need paper and a pen, hold on.\" And was put on hold again. Then I was put on hold (without being told) during the middle of my order. I made a mistake during my last order and promptly got yelled at by the employee. Then I was told my order would be ready in 30 minutes. Spoiler alert - order wasn't ready in 30 minutes. The promised time on my ticket was 11:18 and I finally demanded a refund at 12:15 because they didn't even start my order, which was not correct (due to the incompetent human on the phone). I got an attitude about my refund and a half assed apology. And now I'm hangry."}
{"text":"So, the wife and I have been to several Cafe Duo's and this one is the biggest disappointment. Ill give you an example. I come in hungry as all Hell. I want a steak burrito. So I order one. The young lady says we don't have any and it will take 30 min to get steak. 30 MIN!!! Really? I even offered to cook it (knowingly I couldn't) So I decided on the shredded beef.   The next gentleman who puts on all the extras I ask what's up with a 30 min wait time for the steak. He looks over his shoulder and back to me and say, \"we don't have anyone who can cook it\". Seriously!!! Several staff members around and not one can man a effing grill????  So basically I'm extremely concerned that this is what we will have in place as a society. Abeled body persons that don't know how to cook steak. If I wasn't so damn hungry I would have went somewhere else.....  Can't cook steak...... Fucking kidding me..  But what I did order was good. 2 stars for customer service and bad managers not putting the correct people in place to satisfy a customer..."}
{"text":"I used to visit all the time but then started experiencing long lines and long waits. I then saw them cleaning the vents by standing with their sneakers on the chicken grill. I promised myself I would never return and a year later I broke that promise. Never again will I return. . I visited on Sunday August 21st at 530pm. I felt so bad for the staff.   I preordered my meal. When I arrived the cashier was on the phone calling her manager. I felt so bad for her as she was trying so hard. She should get a bonus. The conversation pretty much said the manager left, we have one person working the line, the dishwasher won't work the grill, and we are out of chicken, rice, steak, and salmon. She begged the manager to come to work to help and s/he was not being receptive about helping.   She then returned and told the line for pick up orders to join the main line as they only have one person working the prepline and it would be quicker.   I went in the prepline and ordered my meal. The lady was very nice and was trying to work fast. I give her loads of credit. Sadly I got the wrong order and burnt chicken when I opened my meal at home. Also I tried to use the app which had a B1G1 but told they can't honor it.   To the management team- you should support your staff and have a manager during prime operating hours. I heard the employee say that the manager had another job to go too. I feel bad for that manager but schedule someone else. You should not run out of food and have one employee working the line. They were obviously stressed.   I used to love this location but will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was very good and more than plenty. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Find it on west lake mead just pass buffalo and the Golden Arches."}
{"text":"It's so unfortunate that my first time yelping is because of the HORRIBLE experience I had. Everyone was in a bad mood, Rolling their eyes and making snarky comments.  It's really upsetting because the food was amazing, but the customer service I received will insure that I never come back to this location."}
{"text":"These places are everywhere. Overpriced fast food with a catchy name. Go to Taco Bell and keep your money. The food is so-so. Nothing remarkable, I can't name one thing that is worth mentioning. The lines are long and the workers looked bored with Americans asking questions about the menu.  The two stars go to the lady making the fresh tortillas. But, nothing else. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Like the other reviews. YES IT IS A HIT OR MISS.... more miss than it is a hit to me & my family.   I'll talk about one instance I came by myself. It was around 7:30pm on a slow Friday. Good for me, no long lines. I get served my sweet barbacoa pork tostada, & I get to the part where they ask you what sauce you would like. (I usually get mild) so I said mild, the gentleman then informs me \"we don't have any at the moment, actually just the hot\". Well I'm a person that hates anything spicy. I asked \"so I don't really have a choice?\"  \"Yea we don't have any\"  3 things wrong with that  1. Why didn't you inform me before I started ordering what if I'm a stickler & can't eat my food without the ONLY sauce I like  2. Why didn't you offer me an option like \"would you mind waiting for a new one\" but instead nothing, didn't even bother asking the people in the back to make any!!!! 3. No apology for not letting me know in advance or for not having it PERIOD!! What a moron.   Already dissatisfied, I get to the cashier, PAY. & not a single time did anyone ask how I was doing, not a single smile from the employees, or an apology for not having an item that pretty much everyone uses.  I get it you guys are 2 hours away from closing but don't treat me like I'm a customer that will ignore something like this. Mind you I'm more upset about the customer service than them really not having that sauce.   Ps. I've never had a great experience at any of the branches, but this one seems to get my blood boiling every single visit. I just wish there was one closer to my house than this."}
{"text":"The food is great but everytime I go the wait is horrendous.   The last couple times I just left.  Way too long of a line. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is delicious!  I usually get the fire grilled chicken salad to go.  I get extra chicken and my husband and I can share it.  Their portions are reasonable.  I like this location because they are quick.  The Cafe Rio on blue diamond takes forever so I rarely go to that location because they don't have a sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Horchata on the fountain is going to get me everytime! So many different options and so many different combinations! I have to try them all. Customization is unlimited! Great service friendly staff something different!"}
{"text":"Easily beats Qdoba and Chipotle.   The handmade tortilla shells and hand grated cheese were phenomenal.  The prices were pretty much the same as the others listed,  but with much better quality food."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is my new favorite place to eat....with a location close by work I probably stop in here at least once a week. Fresh made tortillas, corn/flour/wheat...yum! My absolute favorite are the chicken tacos on corn tortilla. They make everything right in front of you and you get to choose and pick what you want. Generally I just get it with cheese, pico and lettuce and a side of rice. The shredded chicken is sooooooo tasty and moist. Service is great, they have these lil chants if you are a first timer, if you want extra cheese, etc. Their frequent stamp card definitely motivates me to come back. and I will be back. YUM!"}
{"text":"As much as I love Cafe Rio food I will never be returning to this location. Cafe rio has an option to order online. I placed my order at 5 pm online and I leave work to get there shortly after. When I get there, there's only 2 people in line. The 2 people received their orders and left. Now it was only me and I asked if they could fulfill my order. They told me the promised time was 545 so that's when they would have it ready which was a good 20 minutes away. Basically what they were telling me is that it would have been more convenient for me to wait in line and order then to order online when there was NO ONE ELSE THERE! The manager sensed my grief and told me they would start my order right away. Well it was not 540 and my order wasn't even ready yet. I had paid online and I couldn't just give them $28 bucks especially with the service being so horrible so I had to wait. 545 rolls around and I still haven't gotten my order. By this time I'm pretty irate and all they can say is they had other take out orders as well. When you tell me it will be ready by 545 it better be especially since you wouldn't accommodate me and get me out the door quicker. The manager didn't even say anything and didn't even try to make the situation better. Save yourself the hassle and DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT order online! Actually don't even come to this location, just stop by the Chipotle instead right next door."}
{"text":"First, the food is delicious. It gets 4.5-5 stars.  The service and experience is horrible. This was my 4th or 5th time to Rio and every time it seems like the employees have no idea what is going on.  Tonight they were out of chicken and pork and guac and sour cream. There are 6 people behind the counter all having a great time while I'm waiting just to pay for my food so I can start eating.  Maybe they were high or maybe they just don't care."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places Togo for a burrito. The portions are great and so is the price. My only complaint is that they put out coupons for bogo burritos and the eastern location would not honor it. Other then that it is a great place. I would suggest leaving extra time if you plan on going here... The lines can get pretty long."}
{"text":"Café Rio is one of my favorite places to eat but this location is pretty much always nonstop chaos behind the counter. It is very difficult getting exactly what you want on your order because they try to rush you through so fast, even after standing in line for 20 minutes. Then there is virtually no communication between the stages of building your food between employees and the cashier. Food does always taste good but way more stressful than necessary lol."}
{"text":"The queso at cafe rio was the best part about my visit. I would definitely choose Chipotle over Cafe Rio any day, but I would also return to Cafe Rio and get their queso another time. Luckily, there was a large parking lot so the parking was very easy. The employees were all very friendly. The burrito I had was subpar and fell apart immediately, making it difficult to eat. I am a big fan of rewards programs and appreciated how Cafe rio has one with good benefits."}
{"text":"I've been here enough times to get my free meal (10 times, 11th meal free). It's one of the better places to go if you're looking for a bite to eat near UNLV. While I wouldn't call it authentic Mexican food, it does make for a good lunch. I pretty much see this place as a Chipotle 2.0.   Their highlight seems to be their pork; more specifically, their pork burrito. It has this savory sweet flavor to it that is actually quite tasty. The burritos are pretty large, too. They could easily be boxed up and saved for a second meal. Unfortunately, I'm not looking to gain my Freshman 15 back, so I have only eaten this once. Their salmon tacos are also a good choice, if you're looking for something lighter.  Now, I'm a college student. I almost eat out for my weekday lunch on the daily. Therefore, I strive to be cheap, but not dollar menu cheap. This place is kinda pricey if you go off their general menu and get a drink. Be prepared to pay $8-10 if you do. I usually go with their daily special, which usually comes around to a more reasonable $6-7, plus you get a drink with it. While their daily specials are not as tasty as their burritos, they get the job done for me.  Keep in mind that this place is right across the street from UNLV. It can get pretty packed over the lunch hour. I've seen the line go as far as reaching the front entrance (15 min wait). Just a tip."}
{"text":"It's ridiculous how expensive this place is, then they barely want to put a full serving on a bowl, finally,  how every time I order the same thing the price changes. I dont get most of the items available and they still find a way to make it expensive.I understand it's a business, but it's just irritating. It's good, but not $9 a bowl good."}
{"text":"Came here a few months back and thought to try again after pretty bad customer service.  we stood in the line with no one ahead of us while two employees carried on with their  conversation.  Food was good but service left me a bad taste for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Hmm after reading all the reviews I figured I'd give this place a try.  I won't be going back, I ordered the chile roast beef enchilada style the rice and meat taste as if it's not fresh but frozen and lacks any taste. We also ordered the sweet pork barbacoa burrito and I was told it was like eating a sweet potato   I was supposed to receive a free drink yet I still got charged for it, and the drink itself the mint lime aid ehh what a joke.  They get 1 star for effort, so in closing I'm gonna say this is frozen meets fresh veggies"}
{"text":"The food was delish,  but after asking if they offered gluten free chips and/or tortillas the world shuttered and they had no idea as to what I was referring to. Four people later, including a supervisor on duty and we finally got a less than definite answer. Thankfully, there was a lady in line behind us that DID know.  Good Grief!  Learn what's in your food people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The only reason you're getting 4 stars is because the food is bomb!  Customer service was crap."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is usually reliable and decent for fast Mexican food... If you haven't eaten here it's worth trying.... But this location (blue diamond) has to be the SLOWEST service of any cafe rio in the country.  Not a one time problem, every time, it takes this location 3-4 times as long to clear a line than any other location I've visited.  If you ever do get your food, it should be pretty good... But that's a big if."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for pick up at a specific time. When I got there, nobody knew what was going on. Someone had to find the order, then I got to see her argue with a cook to make the meal. After he insulted her, she made it herself. All in all, it took longer than it should have for a pick up order, and I got to see a really awkward argument. Disappointing, but the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Every time I order online this locations gets it wrong.  It can't be that difficult to read printed directions and have it ready at the time noted.  But no, two orders in a row and it was not ready and then done incorrectly.  I'm done trying"}
{"text":"Best thing about Cafe Rio are the homemade tortillas.  They roll them out and grill them right in front of you.  They are really really good.   Wish I could buy a pack of them to take home.  The Barbacoa pork was very tasty also.  The pulled pork is mixed with a sweet spicy sauce.  I ordered a burrito stuffed with it, and the wife ordered a salad topped with it.  Her dressing was so good, a creamy tomatillo dressing.   They stuff the burrito and top the salad with rice, beans, and pico.  I would definitely come back for more pork, creamy dressing and especially the tortillas."}
{"text":"Yummy food.  I like to eat here for lunch. Everything is good but my favorites are the quesadilla and huge salad, the best part is the creamy green tomatillo dressing (looks like ranch but green) I put it on everything not just the salad but the burritos,  tacos,  and even dip my quesadilla in it."}
{"text":"I am so done with this place! We had guests come into town from Utah and they wanted to eat at Cafe Rio. We said \"oh please, anywhere but this location\". We told them about how poorly ran this location is and that they frequently run out of popular menu items, but they wanted to go anyway since its close to our house and we were short on time. They said \"they won't be out of anything since it's a slow Monday night\" Well... check out this picture. On top of being out of something AGAIN the lettuce was brown. The grilled chicken was burnt and dry. And the food prep line was a terrible mess. This has to be some sort of food safety violation.  I recommend you drive a few minutes and go to one of their other locations. This one is a disaster!"}
{"text":"Whoever does their prep needs some serious retraining. My last two visits they were out of shredded chicken and steak (at 7 pm), and then guac and beef (at 3 pm on a Saturday). The most recent time I ordered shredded chicken enchiladas and the guy filled up my tortillas halfway, said \"I'm out of shredded can I give you the rest grilled\", I said sure, (even though their grilled chicken is flavorless trash) and he rolled em up, moved on to my brother. He began to order, the dude said to him, \"Gimme a sec, boss\" and went to grab some things he needed on the line. Including the shredded chicken he just told me they were out of. Lazy and rude. Easy to be lazy and rude when there isn't much good food on this side of town. Good luck"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is the bomb. They are the best Mexican food chain in the vegas area. Quality ingredients and everything unbelievably tasty. Service always good at every one I've been to in vegas. Good price. All around highly recommended."}
{"text":"So up until last month I had never even HEARD of this place. My husband is from Utah and knows all about Cafe Rio. He was raving about it and telling me that it was right up my alley. I'm kind of a brat....I like to think I know it all, so I just laughed and said, \"How could it be that great if I've never heard of it...?\" Blah, Blah. I'm so diplomatic, sometimes..... So when we looked up a Vegas location near us, it was soooo crazy...they have one on the same block as the Chipotle that I so often frequent. I had apparantly driven by it a dozen or so times and never  even noticed or cared. But oh MAN, do I care now!!  If you like fresh, fresh, fresh mexican food then this is your place. The chicken and pork burritos are exceptional, and it is all put together in front of you in assembly line fashion. The ingredients all look and taste fresh and fab. You can choose pinto or black beans, with all the fixings like rice, cheese, and salsa, etc....note....you can choose different \"sauces\" on your food... Cafe Rio has their own  very sweet sauce that they serve up which is great, but not too traditional for mexican food, ( If you are used to say, So Cal style like I am ) so if you don't like surprises, choose the \"medium\" sauce, which is more \"traditional.\" (I personally adore the sweeter sauce.) What else is great? The coconut shrimp tacos are delish and savory, and I do love the salads as well. My fave is the Pork Barbacoa with the fresh Lime Dressing. I even ask for an extra serving of the dressing to take it home with me, it's that good. ...my Hubby was right! The food was waaaaya better than I could have predicted, and I stand corrected. (He'd better not get used to it, har har.)"}
{"text":"It's 845 and it's 3 hrs until close and they are out of the Friday special of fideo are you KIDDING me, but I still pay over $20 for 2 of us to eat and the cherry on top is there are no forks!!!!! Seriously?????"}
{"text":"I know it is a chain but I like coming here for lunch. I hate pork but their sweet pork is delicious. This location has great customer service and they are always on top of it when I am there for the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"This place is a clone of Chipotle and Qdoba.  The main difference is price.  A burrito and a soda here is over $10.  The same order at Chipotle or Qdoba is around $8.  Their big thing is \"enchilada style\".  Too bad it's an extra dollar. Guacamole, extra charge. They even charge for sour cream (it's not even good sour cream, tastes like it came from Vons).  There is really no reason to go to this place when both Chipotle and Qdoba are available."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOODNESS! This place is amazing! the sweet barbacoa is so delicious and probably one of the best meats I've ever eaten! The first time I got it I had it in a enchilada and it was to die for! It's also great in a quesadilla too! This place is pricey but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"For the price and quick easy fix for mexican food, this place does it right..Get the sweet BBQ Pork in a salad. WOW. The flavors just come out at you in so many directions. Screw Chipotle and any other \"authentic\" mexican. This is fresh tasting and your not going to get a stomach ache afterwards."}
{"text":"Good restaurant ! I like the concept ! The decorations are original, employees are friendly and the food is good, prepared in front of you ! You can choose that you prefer to put inside your burrito or other. Cheap prices"}
{"text":"This location is just blah. Let me explain why:   1. The employees aren't as friendly the other location that's closer to me. They're just there, working. No smiles. No welcome greetings. Just there.    2. At the location near my house, I order a chicken salad with just lettuce and cilantro. Since I don't get any of the other toppings on my salad, they load up on the lettuce. At this location, it's just the minimum amount of lettuce. And I'm like \"uh that's it?\"   3. The quality of the ingredients here are subpar. I've seen old lettuce and brown pieces of cilantro still being used. And I have gotten sick from their guacamole.   I love Cafe Rio. The food is delicious. But this location is just average. The end"}
{"text":"My tacos were taco soup due to the amount of water. Tortilla were so soggy to the point I have to use a fork. The ingredients are a mess so if you dont like one of them you still get it because they're all mixed.  I have give them 4 tries before I write this bad review."}
{"text":"Café Rio is a clean looking café, nice atmosphere, but the food wasn't that good compared to other Mexican restaurants for the same price. I ordered online, about an hour ahead and the food still wasn't ready when I arrived. The girl at the order pickup window did not acknowledge me as she was speaking to her boyfriend, and wasn't until the manager came over that I received any attention. The manager was polite, apologized for the inconvenience and offered me a free drink, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio, WTF happened to you??? You were one of my favorite places to eat. Now, I must resort to someplace else.   On our last visit, I decided to just get a chicken tostada because my usual chicken salad would have been too much food. Plus I wanted the crunchy tostada shell. So here's where it gets bad. I order the shredded chicken on the side because I didn't want the juices making my tostada shell soggy. As the girl proceeded to put the chicken in a separate cup, she made a comment about how she hates when people get the meat on the side. The guy next to her then made a comment about how he agreed. Um, I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IDIOTS,  I CAN HEAR YOU!!! Then as the guy puts the lettuce on my food, he doesn't let the water drip from the lettuce. So all this water ends up making my tortilla shell soggy. Just what I didn't want. Then to top it off, as I'm eating my food, the chicken is way overcooked and super mushy. And there's a puddle of water at the bottom of my plate. See picture.   I've noticed over my last few visits to this location that the employees don't seem to give a crap about the food they serve. They're just there for a paycheck. No care or quality. I love their food, especially the tortillas. But now, I might have to drive to a further location if I want my fix."}
{"text":"The staff is exceptionally rude. The rice is NEVER cooked all the way and the drinks are never full on the containers. This used to be so good when they opened sometime ago, but I'll choose to drive the extra 10 mins to Costa Vida from here on out. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Cafe Rio fan! You get a lot of food for a reasonable price. And the food is really yummy! However, this location just doesn't impress me.  :(  Today a few coworkers and I went at lunch and 1 person was working the line. It took way longer than it needed too. The cashier was also making us wait to pay while she went back and forth from cleaning the lobby. I feel like that can wait and always should drop what you're doing to take care of the costumer or at least kindly say you'll be right with us.  The food however is worth it! My favorite is the salad. (Its huge, but makes me feel like I'm eating healthy)  ;)  The SWEET PORK IS THE BEST!  After a hit or miss on the service, it's good :)"}
{"text":"Out of Pico de Gallo!? But talk about a miserable staff, not one person was in a good mood. Yikes!!"}
{"text":"We really like this place . The lines can get a bit long but it's a good quality for the price . We always get the taco salad  .  We have never eaten inside the establishment but we do get take out from here once in a while .   From what I see it's maintained okay . They definitely don't have enough staff cleaning up after the people that dine in .   The staff has always been fine nothing to boast about but also nothing to complain about . Way to ride the average joe train   Seriously tho the taco salad is really good as welll as the queso dip .  Recommend for sure . We will have to venture around the menu more so I can update my review ."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is one of my favorite place(s) The workers all have a happy face Get your butt into that line Look up and you'll see some fresh limes Check out the menu is has a lot of food All of which is super good I always order the fire grilled chicken (salad) The reason why is cuz it's bitchen Fresh tortilla, tender chicken, salad, and some beans That meal right there is fit for a Queen I top it with some creamy cilantro And always ask them for extra que-eso  Ok, this is a new Cafe Rio and it's semi close to my house. I legit love it, and will carb out on their fresh tortillas any day! I'm loyal to the fire grilled chicken salad (+1$ for grilled chicken) it's topped with your choice of beans and rice, chicken, salad, tortilla strips, queso, and cilantro with a side of guac. I get it sans pico though.   All of the items on the menu are delicious, their steak is never over cook, nor is the fire grilled chicken. Most of them items can be ordered \"wet\" but I never opt for that.  They have a variety of drinks including horchata, jamaica, and mint teas as well as the fountain drinks.  I really like the customer service here, the workers are all super nice even when gringas make a big deal over not having green sauce ready THAT MINUTE. Lort forbid they had to wait 3 minutes. HMPF.  Anywho, I got some bogo coupons (Rare!) so I def utilized them!!  I love you CR!  Yay!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Cafe Rio!!  My friend brought me here for my birthday lunch normally only eat chicken or turkey. So I have never been here before and I decided to go with the chicken bowl or I guess its the chicken salad. Upon entering it was really really busy so I took that as a good time there was a long line and whilst I waited i looked over the menu. What I loved is that they were making homemade tortillas!! I decided on the chicken salad , there are 2 types of chicken, the marinated one or the fire grilled chicken and I went to for the grilled chicken. I also had it with the beans and the rice. They also put 1 scoop of guacamole some tortilla strips Cojita cheese of course your romaine lettuce. It's served in a really big containers so it's actually kind of nice the only drawback about Cafe Rio is that is pretty expensive and if you get an extra cilantro dressing they charge 95 cents for it.   I got to work and delved into my lunch, my first thought was that I was so excited because it was so delicious. The chicken was really tender the tortilla strips are really fresh and the dressing was a perfect addition to the salad. The tortilla that was homemade is seriously the best part, so delicious and tasted just like the ones my grandma made. The salad is big enough for lunch and for dinner so it's really actually kind of nice so I don't mind paying $10 for the salad itself if you go during lunch be sure to get there early or order online because there sometimes there is a long wait or no chairs available. Also don't forget to get your Cafe Rio card which I still haven't gotten and I'm gone twice.   YAY!"}
{"text":"The food is good , it's fresh , the staff is friendly and helpful ! The Salads are great and I get 2 with everything they got in it !  Add soup and you have food for days !"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Las Vegas location! Our last visit the bathrooms could have used some cleaning. Food and service has been great. There are a lot of new employees training but they are a new location so it's not a big deal. Food is always delicious! Only downside is it is ALWAYS freezing inside, so now I just bring a jacket."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping at the mall, my significant other and I decided to give Cafe Rio a go. Walking in, the tables were dirty and the presentation of the food, grill, etc. was sloppy. But it was pretty busy, and most places don't even go to the extent of showing you the area that is being handled with food. So you have to let that one slide!  But let me say, the first bite was so yummy. This place burns \"chipotle\". As being Latina and knowing Mexican culture. The food was just about spot on. So delicious! The spicy barbacoa was filled with flavor and juice! Not to mention, the rice and beans were so heartwarming. Service was fast and nice, but the food is definitely a must. Will be returning without a doubt."}
{"text":"This place is extremely slow no sense of urgency. 20 minutes to order my food and they forgot to include a sauce I had requested. Only thing that would make me go back are those delicious flour tortillas."}
{"text":"Ordering was a hassle. The guy has to ask us to repeat what he wanted and still was about to get everything wrong. When I got home my burrito had a huge rip in the side and the first few bites were cold. Not to mention within the first bite the burrito had fallen apart and was practically unable to hold and eat anymore."}
{"text":"Soggy is the best word for this place. Its a shame cause the food is flavorful, but they can't figure out how to drain the juices from anything. Nachoes...soggy..not good. How about spoons with holes to drain the half of cup of juice that comes with the black beans. So far I only recommend the soup(ask for no guacamole in it or it turns turd green) or the greasy quesadilla's. Everything else is soggy. ...oh and the service... the don't listen, talk over you,  and generally are difficult to deal with. The good news is after 10 soggy meals you get one soggy meal for free. I could love this place if they would just sort themselves out. 3 stars was generous for this place, if I wanted soggy Mexican food, could of went across the street for Filabertos. Try it for yourself"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. No matter what time you go there's always a long line but considering the quality of their food the line goes by fairly quickly. Wide array of choices and ordering is kind of hectic but all the employees are accommodating. The food is always delicious(kind of pricy but you get what you pay for). The place is always clean and it's very easy to take your food togo(trust me you'll want to)!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!  Mismanaged. Understaffed and tables, soda station, floors, restrooms filthy.  Staff present during my visit did their best to keep up but to no avail.  Sodas, teas etc.. Running out. Phone rang off the hook!!"}
{"text":"I just can't seem to get on the Cafe Rio bandwagon. Oh, I've tried and tried and tried.  There are some things I like about Cafe Rio:  1) location. It is less than a 5 minute walk from my office.  2) the staff are super friendly and super quick, even when the place is hopping  3) it is one of the cleanest restaurants near UNLV.  4) tres leches. Oddly enough, the tres leches here is actually pretty decent. Its not the best, but I've had a heck of a lot worse at places that serve better food.  If this is all it took to get me to love something, my wife would be worried.   But the things I don't like are the reasons I just can't believe in the CR dogma: 1) The food is just bland. Granted, I am limited in my options since I don't eat meat, but the salsas and sauces just don't have much flavor. I am not expecting a spicy explosion of flavor, just something I can taste, but I can't get this here. 2) Price. Just under $10 gets me a burrito and a soda. I can get the same at Chipotle for a almost $4 less, and they have better salsa.  3) The feeling. After eating CR I feel like I was punched repeatedly in the stomach. Ok, its not that bad of feeling, but I just feel icky. I don't know why, but I don't get this same feeling from other burrito joints."}
{"text":"The Chile pork burrito was great. When we walked in at 10pm you thought they were closed they close at 11pm. They were cleaning up and the lights were dimmed very uncomfortable feeling. Wouldn't recommend going after 10pm"}
{"text":"I was surprised to come back to this location after having a very unpleasant experience and seeing a turn around. Service was quick and friendly, and the food was great as well!!! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Long ass line people making orders do not know what they are doing ... Stood in line 20 mins .. Ordered was fucked up  ,.. The food was not good at all and it can't up to 33 dollars !! A enchilada quesadilla taco was not good I will not be back they didn't even take time to make sure it was not sloppy"}
{"text":"Shockingly busy. A Chipotle -like system serving Mexican food. The good- the fresh tortillas. I ordered chicken enchiladas with mild green chile sauce, rice and black beans. Food is bland. Green chile sauce is oddly sweet. Meh."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Don't bother going to this location. I felt like I was in line at Disney! I only wish they had fast pass. Once I got my food I continued to wait and wait to pay. I asked for double meat and didn't get it, but had to pay for double. I don't think you should have high schoolers running the line when they aren't trained. Oh and to top it off there was a hair in my salad, awesome!! Hairnets would be nice."}
{"text":"Simply amazing taco salads and smothered burritos.  Especially the sweet pork!"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner tonight with my family and usually I would rate the cafe rio 5 out of 5 but was extremely disappointed after seeing the employees acting like they were on break instead of serving customers.   While I realize cafe rio is not a 5 star restaurant I do expect a certain level of customer service from employees in the service industry.  We observed a cook on break eating with his family and while the adults ate the toddlers were running around the dinning area with no supervision. A cashier who walked in with her boyfriend and then stood around and talk instead of work. At one point he handed her his cell phone and she walked around talking on the phone. We waited in line to order while groups of employees talked about upcoming weekend plans.   At one point my daughter went to the restroom to wash her hands and walked right out because it was so filthy. She tried to let a cashier know but no one would acknowledge her. This is unexceptionable!  We will not be visiting this location again after what we saw this evening."}
{"text":"I owe it to Cafe Rio to write a review!  Hands down the best pseudo fast food mexican food in  Las Vegas!  It is far better then Chipotle, Baja Fresh, or Roberto's combined!  Everything on the menu is amazing- although the serve huge portions so be sure to head there with an appetite!  The best  on the menu in my opinion is the salad- I am a chicken fan but the pork is excellent as well.  Even the tortilla soup is amazing (if you are looking for something on the lighter side!)  The staff is pretty comical as well- they sing and chant to the first time customers and to the patrons that have earned a free meal with their \"frequent eater card\".  I heart Cafe Rio!!!!"}
{"text":"Always stop here on Fridays for my post work lunch. The staff is always great and food delicious.  One thing I hate is I never see name tags so here's the generic description of my one crappy experience. Stopped in today and the male Hispanic manager on the food prep line was stingy with everything he put on my burrito. I swear you could see him counting the pintos and grains of rice he put on my food. Everyone is always so generous and he barely put anything on my burrito. The food was still good none the less. The other employees were friendly and made sure I got everything I needed."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and speedy and efficient service. My kids love the quesadillas, I think they're free, and the pork salad is incredible!"}
{"text":"I broke my vegan streak with Cafe Rio. I eat vegan 6 days a week so by the time it's my meat day...I'm very picky on what I'm going to consume. I had a steak burrito and was very happy. The lunch time rush is insane but they know how to get people through."}
{"text":"So totally over this place, seriously. I NEVER know how much I'm going to pay for my meal (which is the EXACT same meal I order every time). But tonight was the last straw when the cashier (short, thin Hispanic lady) totally copped an attitude with me about my vegetarian nacho order. She was like \"you only get beans or rice, not both\". Where in the world did that one come from considering the fact that beans and rice in lieu of a protein is listed as an option on the GINORMOUS MENU PLACCARD POSTED ON THE WALL?!? When I mentioned to her that she was incorrect because I always order the same thing, she totally copped an attitude with me which I thought was completely uncalled for and inappropriate. I hope corporate can take notice and rectify this situation soon because I really enjoyed their food. Until then, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very unsatisfied with this Cafe rio. On several occasions I have ordered online for pick up and arrived later than the time they said it would be ready and it has never been ready. Never left a review until today when me and my wife decided to come in and order in store and this time at 9:30, keep in mind they don't close until 11pm, the whole store was turned upside down cleaning getting ready for them to close even though it was 1.5 hours from close time. Not only that staff was very unfriendly and they had no shredded lettuce and also informed me they had no place to prepare the lettuce. Went to pay for my order and was gonna get a drink because I enjoy the mint lemonade and look over at it and it's also empty, so decided against a drink as well. This cafe rio is a joke and extremely dissatisfied! Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We came to this location 2 hours before closing and they were all out of meats except for spicy and sweet pork. They were also out of guacamole, out of the mine limeade, Southwest limeade, lemonade, no Coca Cola, and other fountain drinks. The trash can was overloaded with trash and so was the floor around the restaurant. We've been to several Cafe Rios around the Las Vegas area and they have been great, this location avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Updated 10.20.2016 This place is filthy! The bathroom reminds me of a bus terminal bathroom that hasn't been cleaned in weeks! THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! They are always out of something. When you ask them to make it, they argue with you. WHAT THE HECK?!?!  AVOID THIS PLACE!    WOW! Not sure what happened here, but they used to have great food with great service! Now it's bad service, small portions, and a dirty restaurant! What happened to this place?!?!?  They ran out of meats, so the servers started skimping on the portions. Then the drinks emptied out. The horchata was empty and the soda nothing but carbonated water. The bathroom was FILTHY! We brought it to the attention of the cashier but were ignored. Not sure we will come back here."}
{"text":"Food is good service is horrible and super overpriced. The girls at the register didn't even smile or showed any type of welcoming customer service. Won't be back this is the third time we revive this type of treatment this places isn't cheap you would think they would at least be a little nicer."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever... no one knew how to make small tortillas for tacos or kids quesadillas. How can you be a manager and not know how to do everything there. I cant believe how bad the service was. I have never had this at any of the other locations."}
{"text":"I had tasted their salad dressing a week ago at a family gathering and had been craving it ever since! Went in early on a Friday night, ordered a salad, kid had a tostada and husband had a burrito. The service here was absolutely terrible. The gal making our food was miserable. She had zero desire to be there. Throwing things around and slopping food here and there. When she put the tostada together she didn't layer the ingredients... she just plopped it on there in rows. Which doesn't make it easy to eat. Or appetizing to eat. Read a review on here saying they had good queso and chips. Their queso had clearly been over cooked. It looked lumpy and gritty. I couldn't believe the guy just mixed up that sludge and served it anyway. No. Just gross. I returned it for guac- which was decent. The aguas frescas are seriously over sugared, felt like drinking syrup. I cut it in half with water- better.   The best thing about this place is their salad dressing and chips. The rest of the food was decent. The service, attitude and energy of the environment guarantees I will not be returning. I can't imagine working in an environment like that, management needs to boost morale and implement some customer service training.    Still can't believe the dude served that brown queso."}
{"text":"How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.    I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...  Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this -   Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed the shredded beef enchiladas. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place. I've tried the burritos, I've tried the tacos, I usually end up getting a salad.  Nothing really excites me here. I usually get either salmon (which is a nice option at extra cost) or the shredded chicken. While the portions are generous, I question the quality of the lettuce at times. I saw from other reviews that people have gotten sick from the place. It also seems to me at times I don't feel well after eating here either, but I almost think it's because of the fiber from the veggies?  The place is usually pretty packed during peak lunch and dinner hours, so be prepared to wait a bit. They also have an app that basically replaced their punch cards - you should get it if you plan to frequent this place.  I'll leave this place at a neutral 3 stars because the food is just \"ok\". The workers are all very nice though."}
{"text":"One word! Barbacoa. Best meat I've ever had. Their Horchata is the best in town! Line moves smoothly and if it takes a while, it's because of customers. That's right, us the people. It's because they don't know the menu. They have two set up and crazy simple. Just go: burrito, barbacoa, pinto, and go red sauce. So delicious. Always say yes to the guac! You'll love it. Trust me!"}
{"text":"It kinda always depends on whose working when you order. Because sometimes they're stingy with ingredients. The food is really good. MUCH better than the other similar places. My favorite thing is on Tuesdays.. they have coconut shrimp tacos which are sooo good. We get their tostadas and their nachos quite frequently as well. I've never had anything bad from them"}
{"text":"Awful disgusting had one big pieced fat I won't go there again all that for $9.74 even Taco Bell is better then that crap"}
{"text":"If you're a big fan of chipotle consider this chain an upgrade from the usual menu Chipotle has. The meat is heated up through a rolling microwave device, which melts the cheese and crunches any chip. My favorite dish to get is the Carne Asada nachos! I always stack my nachos with the most toppings I can get, that's just how I roll. I've tried their salads, which too is bomb! I usually stick to the steak, but I hear that the other meats are good. The only downside to this place is that they're hella greedy with their toppings. They try to give you as little as possible, and end up charging you for another scoop. I never pay anything less than $15.00.   But the place is worth a try, there nachos are hella better than Roberto's regardless of the price."}
{"text":"9/20/2017 @5:15PM: Had one of the worst meals EVER recently at this location. I've never been disappointed in their food, but today was bad. Tacos had dry chicken and no cheese (ordered extra cheese), chips were soft, stale, and undercooked, queso was lukewarm, and enchiladas were congealed in cheese (I got there just as they were bagging the food, so it didn't sit there). Asked for whipped cream and strawberries on tres leches, and they were out. There's a Vons in that center, why not go get some? Can't believe I paid for this."}
{"text":"Solid healthy (if you make it) lunch spot!  I love this place and their fresh tortillas.  MMM the hand made totillas and their creamy cilantro dressing is so tasty to dip and eat when i'm on a carb craving.  but their veggies and beans are all very tasty as well.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Rio.  Food is always fresh and great tasting without all the fast food garbage you find elsewhere.  Today I had the chicken tostada special. Something different every time.  I love the Burritos too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy Café Rio. This location however, did not impress. The line wasn't long when I arrived but it took FOREVER. Employees seemed flustered and annoyed. I got a salad and it wasn't as yummy as it usually is. The lettuce weren't even chopped. I had huge pieces of lettuce that I had to rip up myself. The tortilla wasn't as good either. I probably won't return to this location. It wasn't inedible or terrible. It just wasn't as good as it typically is."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for good quality, flavorful fast food mexican food. I personally love the chicken salad with the house dressing. Their salads are  big enough for two and very filling for both people. I also enjoy their steak quesadeo and chicken burritos. Cant really go wrong with anything on their menu.   They're alway super busy during lunch and dinner rush but you never have to wait too long because their staff works pretty efficiently on the food prep assembly line. This location is well maintained and clean and the staff is all pretty friendly and personable. I would definitely recommend Cafe Rio to anyone for a yummy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have heard that Cafe Rio was a decent place to eat and Favored by many of my friends and coworkers so on a whim and an empty stomach I stopped by.  The place is about as close to a Chipotle Restaurant as you can get literally there's a Chipotle right next door. The concept is a copy as well but that's not a bad thing and if it works go for it. But the Chipotle style is not why I came I came for the food and can see why so many people like this place the food is fresh and it's a lot an d for the price mine being about $12 it's not bad I was a little disappointed though that they didn't have a brown rice option and for that reason I am not going to give it 5 across the board just because I think that people should have a healthier option. All in all it was good and I will be back"}
{"text":"WOW do not come to this place is you are hungry! They are  greedy with food, they act like they are paying for it. There serving size sucks for a huge tortilla! They assume you want everything and put it in your food without asking you. They can't even get the order right. Nobody smiles or is welcoming. I gave this place a second try after it was the same experience  AS the first one. NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"Nachos done the way they should be, a pork burrito to die for and stellar service. This place is always top of my list for lunch and quick family dinners. Prices are reasonable, quality is good, and the facility is sparkling clean."}
{"text":"The house made tortillas are delicious! Also can't go wrong with there grilled chicken salad. Only complaint is that it is always busy and there is not a lot of space."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times before and tonight was a disappointment. The rice was not cooked and made our meals very inedible. It's sad when your expectations of a restaurant is always stellar and then they disappoint this way. I know everyone has their bad days but because of this, it left anmad taste in our mouth, literally."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and only one gentleman was actually working.. Everyone else was standing around just talking as I stood there for 10 min waiting to order.."}
{"text":"Used to love cafe rio but they seem to have gone down hill.  Chunks of grease in my salad along with raw tortilla...over priced food especially since I just threw it away."}
{"text":"Workers are idiots ..very unhelpful and sloppy! Last time I go there! Disgusting ..get better staff ..unfortunate because it's s good setup"}
{"text":"$40!!!  Three à la cart enchiladas, one salad chips and a drink!!!!!  Enchilada cheese is not even close to melted. Staff is a bunch of young smart ass kids  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Make it Vegan.   Get the salad with no cheese on the tortilla ask for double rice double beans. Both beans should be vegan but the black are definitely. Get shredded lettuce pico. guacamole cilantro tortilla strips and the cilantro vinaigrette!!  Delicious"}
{"text":"1st time at this place and it will be my last. The service was terrible. The food was mixed up and the cashier was handling our food without gloves. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed on our Tempe visit today!  They rushed us and didn't even ask us for toppings nor if we wanted a drink and then immediately took our money !  Seriously take a breath and give good customer service please!!  Plus I don't like to eat the discards!! Ugh"}
{"text":"Sooo...I've been to Cafe Rio a total of 4x now and I can give them 4 stars! The first 3 visits I honestly did not like this place. Seemed like I could never understand what the fuss was about because everything I ordered just didn't WOW me to want to rave about it. BUT...I FINALLY found my 'Cafe Rio dish' to make me write this review and actually want to go back and get this damn burrito again. I'm actually thinking about how yummy it was as I'm writing this! LOL  I got an enchilada style burrito. Inside I got the cilantro rice, with no beans. The sweet barbacoa pork, mild sauce, cheese. I had a side of this creamy green sauce. On the side lettuce and pico.   Ohhhhhh it was soooooo freakin good! Might be what I have for dinner tonight on the way home from work!"}
{"text":"Found this really good Mexican cafe last Sunday! It was somewhat like Chipotle (but better and fresher).  Set up was good that you could either sit outside or indoors.  Croweded and busy because of good food.  Kids friendly environment.  Great ambian lights. Sitting was bit too close to eachother and if hou are careing big tray, bit hard to pass betwwen two chairs and table due to bit narrow space.  Great fresh Ingredients, fresh tortias and outstanding salsa.  Very good service and good option for soft fountain drinks.  Will go there again for sure.  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Do not call head they freget about your order. But food is go. But service suck I got there order was not field and wait 1:45 to fill it. I should of got in line it would of been faster. Next time I will go to the one on Sahara. That never happen to me at that location."}
{"text":"This is a good spot if you are craving Mexican food, but are in a hurry. When we first moved to town we ate half of our meals here. Café Rio was new to me as I'd never had one in other cities I'd lived in.   The food is pretty good for fast food. Mt favorite meats are Pork Barbacoa or Chile Roasted Beef. I like that they have a wide variety of meat options. All of the meats seem to be well prepared and flavorful. All of their food options come in huge portions that are reasonably priced for the portion size. The tortillas are made fresh in front of you which is cool. You can taste that they are fresh too. The drink options are really unique. My favorite is the Mint Limeade. They also offer specials each day to keep the menu unique.  Café Rio has a punch card to get a free item after 10 purchases and sometimes they put coupons in the mail for BOGO which is cool. That isn't something you'll get from their competitors.  This location gets crazy busy on weekends and at dinner time. Sometimes it takes 20+ minutes to get through the line even when the line isn't that long. If you get something quick and the five people in front of you have an item that takes longer you'll get stuck waiting. One night the people in front of me were very particular and my quesadilla sat while they asked for ten different sauces. Maybe I'd recommend pulling someone with one hot item to the front if others are going to be awhile. It wasn't even the wait that really bothered me, but watching my food get cold while waiting was annoying."}
{"text":"thought it might be good...considering i was 30th in line...wasnt expecting raw tortillas and an overall bad meal...if it were up to me...i would never go back"}
{"text":"It's funny to see such negative reviews considering this place is ALWAYS packed. I love all the food here. The fresh tortillas and the queso are so good. Waiting in line sucks but that's about the only bad part."}
{"text":"I've been on Mexican fast-food craze lately, so I decided to check out Cafe Rio. It's pretty similar to Chipotle and Qdoba. You stand in line and choose what you want (burrito, taco salad, etc) and you move down the line and tell them what you want in your order.   I really liked my sweet pork taco salad. The meat is basically pulled pork, but with a sweeter sauce. They have more meat options and dessert options than Chipotle or Qdoba.   Cafe Rio is about $2-3 more than what you would pay elsewhere. Until they can beat Qdoba's $6 student meal, they will remain at 4.5 stars =P"}
{"text":"When these restaurant started popping up, there was talk that they were going to be better than Chipotle.  Unfortunately, as I have experienced, they are not, far from it.  And I don't even like Chipotle all that much.  I don't care for Cafe Rio's menu selection and I have yet to like anything that I have ordered from this restaurant.  The meat sits in juice as if it came out of a can.  The meat is so saturated and soggy it completely ruins your burrito or taco thus making for a messy eating experience.  The meal is so hastily prepared that half the time I have to disassemble my burrito or taco so I can redistribute the ingredients evenly.  Why do I have to do this?  When you ask for special items like pico or sour cream it is carelessly slopped into one spot just like Taco Bell does it.  You get all your pico or sour cream all in one bite instead of each and every bite.  I feel like I am basically getting taco bell quality food, but to add insult to injury, I am paying a lot more for it.  I took my family of 4 here for lunch and it cost me 52 dollars.  And one of those meals was just a quesadilla for my 7 year old daughter.  That's not only too much money for a quick lunch, but also too much money for Taco Bell level food.  Every time I come to this location, the mint lemonade is out.  The only thing I like at this restaurant is the mint lemonade and they are always out when I come here.  So then I am forced to drink something else I didn't want in the first place.  I paid 52 dollars and couldn't even get the mint lemonade.  Also, it always seems like this restaurant is always out of cup lids, utensils, or ice and the tables are always a mess.  All in all, this is just a gross place to eat. I gave it 3 tries, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I get the feeling it's a Chipotle in sheep's clothing although they may offer more. I ordered their version of a bowl and tacos. In my opinion, it was bland. I prefer marinated flavors in my meats and that's why I think I'll return to my go to alternative.  Also, when I was there, due to the limited seating, it felt overcrowded and very noisy."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Try everything it is all delicious. I prefer the fire grilled steak salad with their house dressing. The house dressing is like nothing I ever have had. It is so good I've thought about trying to make some of my own. Go here and you will be happy with whatever you end up getting"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I've never been disappointed by the taste or quality of the food, in fact, I actually live in California but travel here once or twice a month, and Café Rio (not necessarily this location) is one of my stops. I usually get the nachos or taco salad, but this time, I ordered the tostada. I was disappointed at how little food I received today. That's actually not my only complaint. The staff was disinterested. There was someone ready to take my order and she was polite, but that's it. There was a different girl who did the toppings--blank stares from her. Then, the cashier...very much like the first lady. Just doing what's required. Too busy to care about service, I guess. There's another location on Eastern Ave that I'd rather go to anyway. No loss for me. Oh yeah, it was clean inside as far as I could tell."}
{"text":"It's Cafe Rio!  A new eatery for this area of Mesa, which is extremely lacking in quick,decent food options.  Your meal is made to order while you walk the line with all the almond milk drinkers. I like their tortillas but the chips need some work, maybe thinner and saltier with some oil and lime would help.  Everything else is fairly fresh and well prepared, bordering on a little bland.  No real heat going on with the seasonings, but that is fairly typical for this chain.  They have a nice selection of drinks and flavor boosters, which is fun for those peeps who like to feel like they are indulging.  Order ahead and skip the line.  All in all,  Cafe Rio is a good food option for this area but not great."}
{"text":"I normally love this place but this visit the food was not good. I had one shrimp taco (worst ever) and one shredded chicken taco. Soooo much lettuce on them that I had enough left over for a side salad. Just mediocre in my opinion. And on a hot Vegas day the iced tea should be fresh or at least taste like it."}
{"text":"Does anyone know what happened to all the upbeat employees? I started going back after 6 months, and now its like the twilight zone in there. its like they sold the business and fired everyone, replacing them with miserable people who act like their working at McDonald's.   What happened to everyone calling stuff out?"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Cafe Rio's food. I love their sweet pork burritos enchilada style. Anyway this review isn't going to focus on the food because Cafe Rio is a chain. Instead this review is gonna cover this location itself.   Why 3 stars? Inconsistent food quality. I come here quite often given how convenient the location is and Cafe Rio is admittedly quick easy food, especially when I want a burrito. Sometimes the rice is undercooked and weirdly hard. Sometimes the meat seems overcooked and difficult to chew. Sometimes the person puts a boat load of cheese and other times it's barely enough.  Other than that, not much to note. Overall pretty big storefront with lots of seating space. I've been here during prime lunch and dinner times and it can get pretty busy but the staff is usually friendly and they move the line quickly so the wait is never long.   So yeah, basically I haven't had an issue with this Cafe Rio otherwise inconsistent food quality."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork bbq salad that they recommended. It was a bit on the sweet side. I would say that it was very tasty.   Their burritoes are pretty good.   If you ask them for kids menu, they might just give you a free quesadilla.  :)"}
{"text":"Just another Mexican Fast-Food Chain in the Valley? Alot like Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Rubios and the like. Pretty decent but NOT at all REAL mexican food. A watered-down Americanized version at best.  The Meats were good but kinda scarce on the tacos & burritos I had- Too much with the beans already. and the whole thing was just kinda blah!!  Nothing to write home about definitely nothing I'd go out of my way for again.I did like how they had quite a variety of hot sauces for you to try including habanero & Atomic!! :)"}
{"text":"The staff at Café Rio really cares about preparing me a nice meal and I appreciate that. The food is excellent. The store is conveniently located so I can pull in at the end of my work shift, get my food to go and eat it at home. Thank you very much to the manager and staff at the Lake Pleasant Parkway, Café Rio you guys are excellent at preparing food and customer service."}
{"text":"Wow these burritos taste great! Over all a fun atmosphere. Place is colorful and clean."}
{"text":"I've tried, and tried, and tried to give this location and chance, and every time we place a phone order, it's an epic fail.  Sure, we can wait in a 20 minute line so they'll get our order right, but many times we are crunched for time so I call it in.  Once there was a sharp chicken bone in a shredded chicken salad I ordered.  They always give us the wrong dressing, or add beans to our order when we specifically ask for it to be left out.  I also prefer shredded lettuce, and I only get it if I stand in line to put the order in.  I understand they are busy, but it's just unacceptable customer service to have it happen over and over again.  I have even contacted corporate, and the issues have not been addressed.  It's unfortunate because the food is good, but I'm totally over giving them another chance."}
{"text":"We were craving burritos, so we ordered online. Got there at the time said to pick it up and the food was all ready to go! No complaints. Easy peasy lemon squeezy."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio but the service here sucks! It never fails, every time I come they never I mean never have desserts.  I got a side of salsa Fresca but it was not fresh at all. It had been sitting there for a while, it looked like jello. I asked the cashier if they had another batch and she said they were making it. I asked how long will and be and she didn't know. I mean can't you go ask? Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Online ordered... been here for 20 minutes waiting for my ONE salad. Meanwhile I'm watching 4 of the 5 staff members behind the counter, sit and play on their phones. I walk up to ask about my food and they say that I needs to come through the \"queue\"... however they can see that it's paid for and what my order is! Then I sit down and wait... and she the same girl who asked me to wait...proceeds to make her own lunch and go sit at a table.   Also THERE IS NO ONE IN LINE. Not a single soul.  I love cafe rio but will never be back to this location. Awful."}
{"text":"One of our favorites - don't go on Tuesday nights (Taco Tuesday) if you are in a hurry. We love the huge salads, sweet pork tacos, and that they have good horchata."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited for 45 minutes. They were out of grilled chicken, shrimp, pinto beans, mild sauce. Won't be returning. The staff was sure happy and raving that they make $6k last night. Wish they would have been working instead of B.S.ing around. Poorly managed. Sucks to pay $20 for 2 burritos that are not at all what you wanted. Needs better management"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio...where have you been for most of my life? Ok, I admit I discovered you late in life but better late than never! Sweet...pork...barbacoa...whaaaaat?! So delish! It's like the Mexican BBQ pulled pork with a smokey sweetness that had me craving it for months! I turned everyone I knew onto it who didn't know from before. In a quesadilla, burrito, taco, tostada...oh heck I'd even try it on vanilla ice cream. I know sounds weird but give it a thought ;) Then there is their signature chicken...yummy WHITE meat chicken in a special light sauce that has me wondering why the other big Mex place can't serve white meat (?) The guacamole with salsa & cheese could be a meal in itself, creamy guac, crazy fresh salsa with just a pop of jalapeño to wake you up is perfection. They make their tortillas fresh...hardest working tortilla people in my opinion. They give you so much chips that by the end of your meal it doesn't look like you made a dent. The drink bar has the perfect makings for a virgin mojito. I like mixing the mint lemonade with the red stuff with a spritz of soda water. Plus they have flavored syrups if you want ice tea. Talk about the ultimate suicide drink bar!"}
{"text":"Since this is a chain, there's no need to go into their food. Food is the same, like all the other locations.  There are still issues this location needs to work out such as the tortillas being dry. I don't understand why a worker would leave their post in the middle of line orders to restock items when there is a long line of people waiting and there are clearly enough workers in the back doing nothing who could handle this task, including what resembles managers who just stand and gawk at customers. There is no need to keep coming over every 2 minutes to clear tables. You guys watching us like a hawk to see if we're finished is creepy. Let's get with the game and shape up Hendotucky Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food and staff at Cafe Rio! Fast and friendly service topped off with delicious, fresh food. My only issue is when ordering it is so loud in there it's hard to hear what they're asking you."}
{"text":"I had no clue what to expect, at first I thought,\"oh chipotle\" but not at all! Wayyy better love the steak tacos, and they melt the cheese to the shell!!!!! Great customer service too! Only complaint no mist outside and suggestive selling. I put salsa on my tacos an they got soggy(amateur move)"}
{"text":"First time coming here so I have yet to try everything on the menu. I had to start off with their burrito so i took the beef  enchilada style.  It was tasty, just wish I told them to put hot sauce instead of medium because it had more of a sweet flavor to it. Their ingredients are real fresh too. Although, Im sure i will not be drowning my next entree the next time i stop by.  Be sure to bug them about not having name tags. Lol"}
{"text":"I'm seriously a \"Cafe Rio Addict\" in need of a 12 step program.  No joke.    We've lived in Vegas for 4+ years and it took me 3 years to find Cafe Rio...wow, how did that happen?  Since the first bite of their shredded chicken, I've been hooked.  I get their chicken tacos or their chicken enchiladas....always.  As a family, we share chips and queso fairly often and that's always yummy too.  I LOVE the punch card program they have....we rack up free meals regularly!  Love that!  Customer service is almost always fabulous.  I can only think of a couple of times that we had less than awesome service and each time I was thrown off because its just so out of place there.   Give them a try....you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"They have huge delish salads.  They are just amazing!  And, they are nothing at all like Chipotle, they are miles better!  I just wish they had churros :]  yum!  Anyways, I only go there and eat the salads.  Like i said, they are huge.  They take a hand made flour tortilla, and put it at the bottom, and then stack beans, meat (optional), lettuce, pico, guac, cilantro, and cheese.  I usually eat it with the cilantro ranch (at least i think its cilantro), and its delish, and super filling.  In fact, the salad is big enough for 2 people to split.   I do love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous customer service. The staff has no idea what's going on, and how to communicate with each other or the customers. I ordered a shredded chicken salad, and the staff said they ran out, okay understandable, they let us know the chicken will be ready in 10 minutes, we wait, and we ask again when it will be ready, and they say in another 10 minutes. So 20 minutes later, and finally we get our chicken. The experience was definitely one I'll remember to never come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Based off 3 visits! Extremely slow paced. The food wells are a messy wreck, pico falling into cheese bins, guac and sour cream are basically mixed, nasty hardened meat and juices all around the containers, pass bar looks like it hasn't been cleaned in awhile. The only taste the meat has is the marinate juice it's been sitting in (quality meat doesn't leak like a faucet) lettuce is basically soaked in water so if you ordered to go have fun eating a salad that turns to soup in 10 minutes. I don't compare competitors in my reviews but this is a bottom tier Mexican Cafe. Will not return."}
{"text":"Cafe rio has delicious food. I've tried half of the menu and have not been disappointed with the taste of anything. However today at 630pm it was super busy. I've never seen it like that. After waiting for about 25 mins in line they managed to loose my burrito. I had to wait for another burrito to be made. But non the less, I love their food. Could do away with some of the sloppy workers tonight dropping food all over and not one had a smile on their face."}
{"text":"What's the deal with Cafe Rio? I asked myself this question many times as I whizzed by this little Mexican joint on Maryland Parkway in the heart of the University district. I was always on my way to Einstein's or Chipotle (which are both in the same general area). I let my curiosity get the best of me one day and asked a friend to meet me there for a quick lunch get together. I wish I had picked somewhere else to go.  So, the decor has little to offer, it's dark lighting inside was actually quite off-putting to me. As I approached the menu, all I could say was \"meh\" Minus their \"award winning\" pork the menu seemed same-ol, same-ol.   The place definitely wasn't packed, so I was wondering where are all these people who say this place is SO-O great? Anyway, I ordered two tacos, one pork, one chicken. My friend opted for a salad. The tacos were soggy - I couldn't believe how quickly they just dispersed juice down my arm as I tried to eat them. As for the taste - the chicken was okay, the pork - better, but nothing I can rave over.  I'm guessing this place being so close to university gets great reviews from students. I can say I did enjoy the way they heated the tortillas. However, I'd just rather have Chipotle and I doubt I'll be returning to Cafe Rio any time soon."}
{"text":"I've always received good service at every location I've visited. I more of a chipotle person but sometimes I just crave the enchilada style burritos here. Plus they make their tortillas from scratch all the time. If you've ever tried to make them yourself you'd know how hard that is and these people do it with such ease."}
{"text":"We usually visit here every Taco Tuesday. We have tried all the different taco meat options and have landed on the regular pork being the best flavor for all of us as well as extremely moist. Not that any of the other flavors weren't good, we all just like their pork the best.  I always place my order through their app. The app is pretty easy to use and has never given me an issue on my android phone.  I have had difficulty several times with minor things. Usually when I arrive for the order I let them know who I am and will they will check on the order. Now if the order isn't ready here is where the issues have consistently been. The cashier will wander off to either never return and hop on the food line to make things, or when they do come back they never (and yes I mean never) bother to let you know what the status of your order is since it isn't ready at the appointed time. A simple, your order is in the process of still being made or we ran behind and haven't started to work on it would suffice. Instead, I am left guessing where we stand. Since I already let you know I am here for my order, I don't need to ask you a second time where we stand, you need to tell ME since it isn't ready why it isn't ready. I have addressed this with the manager a couple times. The other issue is they will leave out parts of the order. Last week of the 12 tacos we ordered only two had lettuce on them 1-2 pieces, and only 4 had actual cheese in them. I returned them the next day and the manager made good on the order. There has been a couple times where what I ordered in app was on the main receipt but not on the part where they use it to verify the order. So, items were left out because their system somehow cuts off part of the order receipt they use. System issue which needs to be addressed.  The location is always clean and the employees are friendly. The food is always fresh, and the veggies at peak quality.  If for some reason you forget to have them scan your rewards QR image before paying you can add it manually afterward via the scan feature and the receipt within the app. That is an awesome feature and someone was definitely thinking when they brought that option to the app. BRAVO.  Pretty decent tex mex style food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Food is fine, but the service is lacking here. All Cafe Rios are busy - doesn't mean you can't be pleasant."}
{"text":"Overall it's aight. The best thing about this place are their fresh made flour tortillas. Thicker than normal but soft and tender.  Overall quality is alright, the steak is not bad however the chicken is dry. It is over priced. $10 for a burrito is quite hefty although you could technically over stuff it with tons of extra condiments. But what if you don't eat beans and rice... Still have to pay for it regardless.  Staff is always friendly and the place is for the most part always busy."}
{"text":"I placed a to go order via the cafe rio web site.   Couple of things.  Order the grill chicken salad - they didn't put any salad dressing in the to go bag - didn't make it as requested on the website - my wife called to talk to the manager- now been on hold for 15 minutes - cafe rio used to be amazing - not too much these days.  Manager refuses to talk to us."}
{"text":"Apparently, they are cracking down on portions. I noticed right away when the chicken went in the pan. I totally understand controlling costs and for a long time, this location had been overdoing it. That said, this is an overcompensation that feels like a slap in the face! Do the math, increase your prices or negotiate better deals with your suppliers. But never, never serve a product that does not satisfy you customer. I've had bad experiences here before, (mostly due to service, which has improved), but this is the first time the meal was unsatisfactory. Hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Flour tortillas for enchiladas? Blasphemy.  The service was slow, the presentation sloppy and the food underwhelming.   Big portions were the only thing good about this place."}
{"text":"GREAT food. AWFUL service.   They almost always never have certain meats like barbacoa. And when you get disappointed when they're lacking it, the staff makes you feel like it's YOUR fault for not having it. They are very unapologetic. Unfriendly staff, but great food. Also, I went tonight and they didn't have lids to fit their cups! What's with that? Don't waste your time and money here - go to the one by 215 and Eastern, it's not that far away and everything is better there."}
{"text":"Honestly I've never had issues with Cafe Rio until I came to this location. The staff was extremely unprepared and discombobulated. They didn't have any of the essentials I go there for. They didn't have beef, they were low on flour tortillas, out of corn tortillas, and low on their mild sauce. So because of this I didn't want anything but my wife ordered enchiladas, so I decided to stay. Then out of nowhere we get news that her enchiladas were dropped and said it will be a little bit of a wait because now they ran out of chicken. Worst experience I've had with this company. I'm just going to stick with the one in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Usually love cafe too but this location isn't clean. While they were making my salad they had to change out one of the containers that hold the food. The water that keeps the food warm on the inside of their warming table dripped onto my food when they were changing things out. GROSS! I told the guy at the register and he told me that it's just water and my food should be fine. YUCK! Not happy! They didn't add the lime and when they put the lid on my food the lettuce and tortilla was all hanging out...  Never going back to this location..."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be returning.  I asked for a side of sour cream which I only noticed they had some because I saw another person had some on their          plate.  The tiny portion they give you doesn't even fill the small container they serve it in.  Along w the guacamole that comes w veg burrito. The guy serving the pico and lettuce wasn't too friendly.  They need improvement on customer service. The food is just ok."}
{"text":"Service is good and the place is clean  It's a shame chained restaurants generally get less favorable reviews than their inferior mom & pop counterparts"}
{"text":"After a long 4 hour day at the doctor I decided to get cafe rio since I haven't had it in a while so I ordered  2 shredded chicken and cheese  quesadillas beans and rice queso and a Fanta So of course I paid $15.99 for all this which is fine And then when I get to the car to open the bag and check the quesadilla to make sure it's the right order I see grilled chicken instead of shredded now obviously they weren't out they had a lot in the tray  I Went Back To the Place And They Said They Were out HOW CAN YOU BE OUT OF SHREDDED CHICKEN THAT FAST? I'm not going back to this place ever again I Am Finished With Their Nonsense COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place to eat!  The flour tortillas are made fresh as you watch.  I am ruined for flour tortillas from anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"This place is like the soup nazi episode from Seinfeld. If you don't know how to order before you get in line- get out and learn lol! These people are busy so know what you want and you'll be just fine. Yum!"}
{"text":"Way way way better than Chipotle, I didn't enjoy the salad. I did love the burrito last time and I didn't even finish it which is a surprise. Recommend coming with friends."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came into the restaurant we decided to not go to Applebee's cause it was to long of a weight and try something different , we waited in line wasn't impressed how the girl was asking what we wanted and were not even close to her, we proceeded and ordered a steak burrito 2 girls taking order and there was a guy topping it off he had a lot going on and brother of the girls assisted him. We finally got through I kept it simple we got the steak burrito with rice and black beans inside asked for mild on the side that I didn't get but we orders chips and salsa and a small drink. It as almost 17 for us to share a burrito!! Absolutely crazy! How can people afford to go with there family I could understand if it was big portions of lost of things but it was such small amount of it all. I was shocked to pay that much for a burrito."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, it literally blows chipotle out if the water (which is hard for me to day because in freaking live chipotle lol). Their food just seems to be of higher quality and they just seem to have better tasting food. The only problem with this place is their costumer service. I feel as if every time i have gone to cafe rio, they are trying to rush me through and they dont seem to care that i am a paying customer. I want to take my time when i order and feel like my server appreciates my business. That however is the only turn off for me about cafe rio, if it was not for that this place would, without a doubt, recieve a five star rating from me. So to summarize, great food, great selection, better than chipotle (which i really did not think was humanly possible) but horrible customer service"}
{"text":"I can't believe for all this time I have been passing this place for Carl's Jr's Western Bacon Cheeseburger. I went here on Tuesday which meant it was Coconut Shrimp Taco day ! I LOVE Coconut shrimp so this was perfect for me.The tortilla's are home made...at first I thought it wouldn't make a difference but you can tell! The shrimps were nice and crispy. I had their mango salsa with it and it was heaven on a plate! I'm not a big fan of the rice though but it's okay . I also tried their Tres Leche cake and it was good but I wouldn't order it again because I don't like the consistency of it . I've had others which were a little more firm and that's how I prefer it. My meal came with two tacos rice and beans..(I passed on the beans) and a drink. This was all for around $8.65 which I thought was a good price. I also liked their drink selections because they had flavored teas. I had the green blackberry tea which had a good taste to it so it really didn't need to be sweetened .I will be back...on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I gave them another chance today.  This time trying to save some time by calling the order in ahead at 5:15 I called and was told 15 mins.   I arrived at 5:30 and the food wasn't ready so I paid then waited.   5:50 and the food hadn't even started to be made.  So I asked the worker what's taking so long for my food and was told there were people ahead of me in line.  I had to tell them again that I called the order in and the receipt promised a 5:30 ready time.   So finally at 6 pm my food was made by the manager who I had to ask for after arguing with the stupid employee."}
{"text":"My friend was craving Mexican food and decided to order for pick up from Cafe Rio.  I really liked how easy it was to order on their website they had pictures of all their entrees which was super helpful in deciding.    I went with their spicy steak burrito with black beans and no rice. I also requested for the spicy sauce on top of the burrito. When we picked up our order, our food was nicely packed up and ready to go.   My burrito was gigantic, and it was covered in sauce just how I wanted it. The spicy sauce wasn't that spicy unfortunately and it really didn't have any flavor. I liked the flour tortilla it was nice and chewy and soft and the black beans were just ok. But I was really disappointed with the steak meat. The steak meat did not taste like anything, they were  generous with the portions and size of the meat which was nice, but it was just very flavorless. The meat was also drowned in more of the flavorless spicy sauce which made it really difficult to actually taste the meat. I managed to eat half of the burrito because I was hungry but I guess for next time I don't think this place will be on the top of my list."}
{"text":"The food was good but while ordering it seemed that every other person was listening. And kept messing up my order. I still give it five stars because they pulled through and I had a great meal"}
{"text":"The service I received today at this cafe rio location was horrible.  This is the second day in a row that I had questioned returning to this location after what I experienced.  Most of the workers are very pleasant and ask you how your day is going and take great interest in getting to know how their customers are doing.  However, there is one worker in particular, Sissy, (what my receipt says) who constantly has a bad attitude towards customers and other coworkers.  Today, when I asked for chips and queso in a bowl, another coworker had put the chips in the container and he queso on the side.  Sissy then proceeds to scold him and tell him \"you should've put the queso inside the container with the chips.\"  Sissy proceeds to open the chips and put the container of queso on the chips, which crushed the chips.  Disappointing, I didn't know I ordered crumbs.  As Sissy was the only one working the register and handling all the money she had no gloves on, there was a chip hanging out of the container and with her dirty, ungloved hand she put the chip back in the container.  My friend who was in line behind me had asked for chips on the side and when the same worker she previously scolded had proceeded to put it in a container, Sissy yelled at him and said \"are you stupid?  Put it in a bag!\"  I thought that comment was very rude and super unnecessary.  I do not condone this behavior, I personally would not want to work in this environment, and I am contemplating no longer visiting this location.  It's really sad that I don't feel comfortable going to this location because it is the closest to my house, but I do not want to have to deal with this behavior."}
{"text":"Don't come here hungry, go to a different location for real Cafe Rio portion. Full parking lot with no one inside should've been a good enough sign to go never mind ..."}
{"text":"Kathy, my daughter, took me on my last meal while in Las Vegas to her fav' Mexican Fast Food spot... Cafe Rio.   First reaction.... Dang, this place is POPULAR! As in lines out the door! And a little wait while you're waiting to place your order.  On the menu...  Wheat Tortillas (**** 1/2) On first inspection, these Wheat Tortillas look a little too crispy and maybe tough... One of the Assembly Line workers actually gave me a complimentary 6\" diameter Wheat Tortilla just to try! Definitely not a crispy exterior. The Tortilla is a very good alternative to the traditional Flour Tortilla made with Lard... which I still prefer!  But, if I'm in Las Vegas... why not? This is Cafe Rio's Tortilla-making station ( http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uxdGHvw2609oKu0R3z00OA/l )...  Fideo Friday Special (*** $6.95) When Kathy heard I was interested in the Fideo Friday Special... she responded with an \"Ewww!\". In California, however, there are a few courageous restaurants that advertise as being Italian - Mexican. I, myself, think that is not outrageous as one initially thinks. Let me propose this... Chile Relleno Ranchero Sauce with some Pasta... That to me sounds VERY GOOD and Tasty!  After traversing through the circuitous waiting line... Kathy and I arrived at the ordering / assembly line area... where the first glance is at the Wheat Flour Tortilla Making area. You can see the Tortilla Maker make about six HUGE Wheat Tortillas on a round Grill that reminded me of a huge Crepe Griller.  The Fideo Special just did not work... Too watery or liquidy for a Pasta dish whether it's Italian or Mexican. Or maybe the entree had just too many textures... Crispy Tortilla Strips, Grilled Chicken, Fideo... and then that daub of Sour Cream... SOUR CREAM with Pasta?!?! Dunno... just didn't work for me... did not seem like an integrated Entree... just \"stuff\" piled on top of each other.  Cafe Rio's Famous Tres Leches (**  1/2 $3.95) The Tres Leches, with slices of Strawberry and Whipped Cream.... was.... let's put it this way... infamous... not deserving of the fame claimed by Cafe Rio. I realize that Tres Leches with it's three types of Milk will have a resulting consistency very much like an Italian Tiramisu Dessert. The best version I've had was one that used thickened Milk which resulted in the Tres Leches having a consistency more like a Mousse or Custard. Just a suggestion...  Order of Iced Tea (**** Included with Fideo Special) Unlimited Refills... get it yourself at the machine...  Frankly, I was more impressed with Kathy's Pork Barbacoa Quesadilla. If I was rating that, and I only got about three bites, the Quesadilla would be definitely over 4-Stars. But, that was not my order...  During our meal, we noticed and heard all this shouting from the Cashier's area... Later, when the Lunch hour crowd died down... I asked that Cashier what's with the shouting? He said, unless the customer requests them not to shout, that the current customer requested EXTRA CHEESE (or whatever) or that the Customer just received a FREE MEAL with a redemption of one of their Buy 10, get one free cards.    For my part, if I come back.... no extra anything! And since I live in California... the Buy 10, get one free is of no use to me.   Kathy and I noticed, while we were eating that Cafe Rio has these HUMONGOUS Salads that are very popular... especially among the fairer sex. I was thinking to myself.... These Salads might have started out Healthy with all the best intentions.. but when the resulting Salad is close to SEVEN Inches high and weighing maybe 3-4 pounds.... There goes Healthy and Good Intentions down the drain...   Something else of interest... Despite claiming to be a Mexican restaurant, the persons of authority, the Manager and Cashiers, were all non-Hispanic from what I could observe. Virtually all the \"assembly-line\" workers were Hispanic, though...  That's just a couple of thoughts..."}
{"text":"Steak burrito, enchilada style was excellent! I got mine with the cilantro rice, black beans, steak, and hot sauce. Even though I got their hottest hot sauce it didn't seem spicy at all. They put the enchilada sauce and cheese on top then send it through a little conveyor belt oven that toasts the top beautifully! A little lettuce and pico on the side... yummy!"}
{"text":"This review is about their fantastic app. If you dislike the wait in line for your food, please download the app and order your food that way. I love just walking in and picking up my food with the LONG line in progress. The app is easy to use and you can order online too if you don't want to use your phone. With all that said....  I am hooked on their sweet pork burrito with beans rice and hot red sauce and their tomatillo ranch dressing. Sounds crazy but I pour this ranch all over my burrito. Their homemade tortillas make any of their items great. This place is casual with about 20 tables to eat onsite. After eating during peak times at night you'll appreciate my advice with online or app food ordering."}
{"text":"The wife and I have gotten food here three times (2 too many of you ask me).   The first time we ate there and despite the wait, it was good.   The second time the wait for carry out took 35 minutes even though I had ordered ahead of time! They ran out of guacamole (how is this possible?) and the food wasn't hot by the time I got it.  The third time was tonight and that's the last straw. My wife picked up food to bring home. The queso had a gritty consistency which made me hate it. It's queso! How can queso be unlikeable? Well at this location it can be. She got a pork salad, barely any pork to be found, what little we did find was cold and soggy. The rice, beans, pork, everything made the whole salad soggy and unappetizing. I literally feel like I ate soggy garbage.   Luckily we had a coupon and it only cost 11 dollars, but my wife said we might as well have lit 11.00 on fire and watched it burn. Super disappointed. I was hungry!  Never going back to this location. I work in downtown Phoenix and have had cafe rio there multiple times and it's always good. I figured this one had growing pains but enough is enough.   My review, along with everyone else's review in here perfectly shows what you're in store for. 1 Star and 2 Star reviews across the board.   I'm finishing this review still hungry and grossed out at what we paid for. If I was an employee there, I'd actually be embarrassed to serve someone this."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming.  $4 per taco for a chicken taco? Really? Come on man!    $4 puts you into Por que no? territory, and you are not even remotely close to por que no quality.  Even Revolu taqueria in P83 has better quality tacos for a better price.  The misleading sign outside that says $1.95 tacos all day long was pretty lame. You cannot see the Taco Tuesday only exclusionary text from the road as you drive by.  Also, who advertises Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday for next week's Taco Tuesday?  I get that you're new to the area, but misleading signage is probably the wrong way to introduce yourself to the locals.  I know the city of Peoria has strict rules on signs, so this may be a violation."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever seen here! I used to come all the time, tonight there was zero urgency from the staff! The guacamole was brown, they were out of pico, the manager was busy chatting on the side while everyone kind of worked! So bad!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot a few times still don't find anything special about it. Plus its over priced and there very stingy on there sour cream, my salad with extra sour cream was around $13 so not worth it that not including a drink. I would rather go to Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"While cafe rio recipes are some of my favorites, this location is poorly organized and provides terrible service, consistently behind on their online time pick ups and line staff is disorganized causing excessive wait times. If you are in the area go to the 9th street and Bell rd location where they are organized and prompt while serving the same great food."}
{"text":"This is the worst location in Vegas been here twice after the first time it took me about 6 months to try again, UM RUDE, horrible customer service and lacking standards, lazy or you guys don't offer cheese on your tortilla for a salad? An hour and ten min before you close out of two meat options... never again Sahara locations are great along with blue diamond...."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars for the food only, not to hop on the train with all of the other reviewers but the staff really does suck. We watched 3 workers talk about how one of them was feeling ill and about how much ibuprofen she had taken that day...all while she prepared our food right in front of us. Seriously? I understand you having an off day but keep it professional. They continued to talk about what time they were all off and how the day was just dragging for them. All while we stood there. We love the food but next time we'll see if the other location on west sahara has better staff."}
{"text":"Sadly have to agree with the other reviews.  Good food, poor customer service.  Got my order wrong, took forever to get corrected."}

{"text":"I usually go to the Cafe Rio by my work, on Warm Springs and Stephanie, and I love it. I always get the salad with everything and house dressing. It's my favorite salad ever. I've been to this location a couple times and it was just as good.  Well I got back from a long road trip and needed to get a late night dinner. I saw they were open until 11pm and I got there around 9:30pm and ordered a salad to go. The salad did not have the flavor it usually does. It was pretty bland and even the house dressing (which I absolutely love) was pretty meh!  It almost seemed watered down. By this time it was too late to make my way back to complain. So the next day I walked in around 12:30 to see if there was anything they could do. The girl was nice enough to have them remake the entire salad. I asked for everything in it except avocados since I'm allergic. Got home expecting my normal salad. But no, still pretty bland, and still the same dressing as the night before, pretty watered down and weird tasting. Then I realize there's no rice or beans either even though I asked for everything.  I may or may not come back to this one location. It's pretty close to my house, so I may give them one more shot. Don't expect consistency. It may be good or it may be pretty bland and weird. Also, as I'm sitting here trying to eat this salad, I realize that the dressing tastes too much like sour cream. It may be made with sour cream (I'm not too sure) but because it's so bland that's all I can taste, and I'm not a fan of sour cream.  I'm pretty disappointed right now."}

{"text":"I give two stars because the food was good. Ordered online and the food wasn't ready when I got there a half hour after I ordered. How long does it take to make two burritos? I guess a long time. I waited in front of the pick up desk for 45 minutes. I asked twice about my food. And finally it got done as my child had a break down on the floor. Mind you this is an hour and 15 mins after we actually ordered.... 2 burritos.... and as others got their food and ate and left... I'm not one to say anything but after the whole wait one of the employees (not a manager- so unprofessional ) gave me a free meal card.... which I still have to buy a meal to get a free meal.... what??! The food is good. A standard for cafe rio. But not hour- and -15 min -wait- toddler -freak -out good. I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"My first time here didn't go so well. Sub price range food, dirty prep area, waitresses that don't wash their hands after sneezing, incorrect food was again experience on my second attempt. It seems like they're more worried about telling Spicy pork ooh lala. The best thing going for this place is the free refills. Overpriced fast food. They have nothing on Taco Bell. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was sooo happy when I found out they were opening right around the corner from me.  We order at work from Café Rio all the time.  The tortillas and the creamy Cilantro Vinaigrette my oh my are the two best things along with that sweet savory pork.   Great location, although sometimes a little too crowded but they move fairly fast. Will go back over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the worst Cafe Rios in all of Las Vegas and Henderson. Everytime I come here, the service is absolutely horrendous, and my visit today was no exception to that. I've decided to just let it go everytime I come in, because the food is somewhat decent. After today, I decided that it's time I write a review. I'm always greeted with a major attitude when I pay for my food here. And as another yelper said, the drink machines are always empty, and the staff is too lazy to refill them. If you insist, they emphasize the fact that it will \"take a long time\". Even if I say I'll wait, they have an attitude about  it. One of the main reasons I go to Cafe Rio is for their delicious drinks, but now I will no longer be coming to this location, even though it's pretty close to my house. I rather drive extra miles, and be treated in a professional manner. I hope whoever manages this location reads all the negative reviews, and implements some changes."}
{"text":"I usually love Cafe Rio but this location is terrible. I ordered my usual tostada and I noticed that the guacamole was starting to brown. The girl behind the counter just scooped out the brown bits then put the guacamole back. Then one of the girls behind the counter ended up starting an argument with another one of the workers in the back. I left the building very uncomfortable. When I got home and started eating, the rice was hard and stale. The barbacoa was overcooked and chewy. Needless to say I will never be going back to this location. The Stephanie location is now the only one I'm going to."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the cashier Dominic was amazing! He asked if I had the Cafe Rio app in my phone for rewards points. He encouraged me to sign up for $5 off of my 1st purchase (sweet)! He also let me know that if I did the survey on the receipt, I would get a FREE dessert (yummm). Everyone likes perks! Kuddos to the cashier knowing all about the promos for Cafe Rio. Thank you Dominic for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a cafe Rio open in this location. It looked promising from the menu. My visit was yesterday mid afternoon 1/3/16 and I ordered a Salmon tostada and the presentation was nice - but the rest was disappointing.   Salmon was stored in the metal steamer pans like their other meats. However, my dine-in order was cold cold cold salmon. Yuck!!!! If it were served a little warmer it would have been much better. I was so starving I was about to eat my arm off so I ate the salmon anyway. The prices seemed fairly reasonable and there were some healthy options. I will give this try again another day and reassess. Maybe it was just a bad day to come in here. Boo."}
{"text":"My go to lunch or dinner when I'm in need of something for 2-3 meals! I get either the salad or quesadilla, both really good. I get the sweet pork which is the only meat I've tried but can't seem to try anything else because it's so good. I've never really had a problem until today, my friend got the same thing I did, hot sauce on the side, but was not charged for the sauce. I got charged! I thought hot sauce was included (I may be wrong). But shouldn't hot sauce be included? I just wanted it on the side instead.... I guess next time I'll have to have them drizzle it in instead."}
{"text":"The sweet pork salad is my guilty pleasure!  I ask for the whole wheat tortilla with black beans.  I love to get it to go and come home and enjoy with a great movie or TV show."}
{"text":"This place is really just okay, can't understand what the hype is.We came again because we had a BOGO for a burrito or salad. But even with having the price slashed in half it was still more expensive than chipole and didn't taste as good.   The staff is super fast, they're like hovering with the sauces they think you'll get so you kind of get anxiety that they'll put it on. You have to practically shout at them to \"no, the spicy one\" or they'll put the wrong one. They're driven by quantity not quality.   What we got: 1. Chicken burrito: comes with rice, black beans, cheese and your choice of sauce. I asked for the spicy one and it was not spice at all. Maybe 2/10. Tasted mild at best. Then had more hot sauce placed in it. It's served with the lettuce and salsa next to it. 7.79ish, but extra dollar for sauce to cover it. Not worth it.  2. Steak burrito: again rice black beans, cheese and spicy sauce toasted. With more hot sauce covering it. With salad next to it. 7.79+1.5 cause it's sliced steak (confusing, I don't get it) +1 dollar for sauce to cover it. Again not worth it"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  The staff cannot follow an order. Two orders were prepared incorrectly and was charge over $14 for 2 deliveries. The store offered nothing to repair the 2 ill-prepared orders. This location also charges inconsistent prices compared to the Lake Meade location. The staff is very incapable."}
{"text":"I'm really not a huge fan of this place. The food is decent but a little overpriced. They charge for extra sour cream and guacamole. Most places charge for guacamole, but here you get less than a tablespoon. And sour cream? Lame. Fresh made tortillas are amazing, but that's about it as far as anything standing out. You're better off walking through the parking lot to Chipotle. Also, they only have one trash can. it would be really nice if they would empty the thing when it gets full."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, Cafe Rio typically is a great restaurant.... However the blue diamond location seems to just not care about their food quality, their customers, their wait times, etc.   This location is about 2 miles from my house and about 3 miles from my office so it's very convenient for lunch / dinner. In the past 3 months I have done 4 orders here and every one of them have been wrong in one way or another. From incorrect ingredients being placed into the order, missing items in our order, to food that tasted old.   I don't recommend this location to ANYONE! it's a horrible location, and the staff, supervisors included, could care less about their customers or the product they produce."}
{"text":"Iced tea is the color of dirty water with no taste. Not sure if the manager knew this or was cutting corners. $2.29 for iced tea , no way ."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I absolutely love the fresh tortillas! I usually order a burrito, enchilada style. It is huge and can be 2-3 meals depending on how much you eat! Their queso is out of this world too!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is for people who don't like going to taco shops or taquerias and love bland fresh-Mex Americanized variety; but there is still a few bright spots in this joint. You won't find menudo with tripe or ceviche, but you will find shredded beef salad within a flour tortilla bowl, topped with a mountain of romaine lettuce and cheese. But don't let that scare you, there are a few items worth trying.  There are two gems in the place: sweet pork barbacoa and flour tortillas. If you dislike pork, I would probably stick to chicken then (a bit dull though). Get the sweet pork barbacoa taco; the only item I really love. The only meat that has good flavor, although a bit sweet. The flour tortillas are soft and tasty. But for the love of Lady Gaga, please don't get the salmon tacos, they're bland and overpriced. To make up for their overall boring food, they have a lot of hot sauces to try.  Service is no nonsense cafeteria style, and you better speak loud because the workers are degraded to yell whenever somebody gets a free meal or is notified of a first-timer. Ugh. For a place that dubbed itself a Mexican Grill and has invested in the decor, they sure don't play Mexican songs or any song that has Spanish words. Instead you will hear Neil Diamond and American oldies. Bottom line: enjoy the barbacoa while listening to Mr. Diamond."}
{"text":"I used to love their food. Until one time I got a bee in my salad. Granted, I understand that fresh produce has the potential to be exposed to such things, but when I called and talked to the manager- she could have cared less. She said she could have them remake my salad - which would be nice if I had dined in or lived close. I live 20 mins away and myself and 2 other people couldn't stomach to try to eat our takeout meals. So $35+ meal down the drain. And no compensation. We refuse to go back."}
{"text":"Ehhh. I don't usually post bad reviews,  but in this case I'm pissed. No strawberry lemonade or mint limeade. The horchata & southwest limeade machine isn't even turned on, so everything is room temp. The bathroom was embarrassing. I haven't even eaten my food yet, I'm actually nervous. Had they at least been friendly I could give a 2nd star, but no such luck."}
{"text":"Love love love this food! I get the pork burrito and I'm seriously addicted. Large portions, perfect proportions! No complaints!"}
{"text":"Portion size very small compare to the picture on the menu. Charged extra for some ingredients without letting the customer know until at checkout.  This place is not authentic mexican, more like american mexican food."}
{"text":"Best barbacoa tacos ever! Extremely delicious! I am a new fan!"}
{"text":"This location is getting better. Since I was in this area I stopped to pick up a grilled chicken salad and chicken taco meal. The line was much more organized and stocked. I would suggest asking for 2 cups of dressing because they are half the size here as other locations. Also if you don't like the tortilla underneath the salad as is it gets soggy, ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but their practice of charging extra money for extra dressing is disappointing. I typically get a salad, but I don't get the shell, I don't get beans, and I get half the amount of meat. No pico, sour cream or guac. either. All I ask for is some extra dressing, and they want to charge me extra. That is simply ridiculous considering all the other things I don't get on my salad. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"They have fixed there dry chicken and they now make tortillas by hand!!!  This place gets 5 star just for that."}
{"text":"Prices kind of high for what it is but the sweet pork barbacoa is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love their food! I'm a creature of habit so I always go with the Sweet Pork Tostada with the house dressing. It never disappoints! I also love their selection of hot sauces, there's literally at least 20 different types.   The only complaint I have about this location is their speed, the line always takes FOREVER. I never understand this since it's an order as you go type place, but oh well I can deal with it for the sake of the taste."}
{"text":"This place ok. For one their very greedy with their portions of meat and guacamole . The sweet pork salad is over priced $8.25 for the meat, beans and rice  they put in it. The only good thing was the homemade flour tortilla. The staff was friendly but I think understaffed. The place is cute. Don't think I'll be back. Costa Vida is 10x better."}
{"text":"How Rude! My husband and I went in a few weeks ago. There were no customers in front of us in line, we stood there for five minutes waiting to order. NOT ONE EMPLOYEE even acknowledged our existence! They were all standing around joking with eachother, which is great, I love seeing a workplace where everyone gets along, just don't ignore your paying customers. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Really good food! The only downside is they charge for every little thing! The guacamole taste like Taco Bell guacamole. But I do like everything else. The app is great for freebies! Big plus is the tortilla are made in house. I love that!"}
{"text":"WWWWAAAYYYY better than chipotle & qdoba!!! I enjoyed my steak salad. And pretty close to the airport. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican spots!! Food is always fresh and delicious! Pork Barboca burrito is my favorite and i get it everytime! I always leave with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. There is nothing above and beyond about them. To me, it seems like a more intricate version of chipotle. What I do like that is different is that they make their wet burritos \"enchilada style\" by covering it in sauce, cheese and baking it.  There were only 3 people in front of me in line, and for some reason it took me 10 minutes to get my food. I also mentioned that I had never eaten there before, but nothing was explained to me, except for a small suggestion when I asked what was better between the chicken and the pork.   She recommended the chicken, but there wasn't anything fantastic about it, I actually found it to be dry.   I don't know. If you are looking for something convenient and close to UNLV, this is right across the street from the SU, and if you like the concept of chipotle but don't like their food, then this is for you.   Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Vegetarians don't go here!!! It is seriously disturbing that the menu features a 'vegetarian section' although it's not actually vegetarian. The employee told me all the beans and rice are made with chicken stock. The tortillas are made with lard. If I didn't ask these questions then I would have been incredibly ill.   Rio - you cannot falsely advertise that menu items are vegetarian when they are not. You can make people sick. Please change the verbiage on your menu."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here and I'm blown away by how delicious the food was.. Wow!!! I don't eat meat but one person ordered the pork and they said this place tops chipolte by a million! new favorite place to eat :)"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times now and both experiences were not well. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it's fairly new. First time I waited 1.5 hours for my online order after they said 30 mins. Second time I called in order and they told me 30 mins. Got there in 25 mins to be safe and food was ready but cold from sitting obviously. Hopefully they get this dialed in soon"}
{"text":"Fresh made tortillas!! I LOVE the sweet pork!!!! The salad is DELISH, with the house dressing.  My son loves the pork quesadillas, and my husband, the grilled tacos.  They come with rice and beans, which to me are just okay, usually a bit dry and not so flavorful.  The customer service is pretty inconsistant.  They try to be fast fast fast, and with too fast you tend to screw up! One time I asked for my son's quesadilla to be sliced, and the guy, in a demeaning tone, informed me that they had plastic knives on the counter, and after my death glare, he decided that he could slice it for me."}
{"text":"I had the salad with the chili chicken, and cilantro dressing. The dressing had to be my favorites part, wow it was excellent. Highly recommend. The actual lettuce was huge, wish it was cut down a little, but overall tasty salad."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but service is slow. The pieces of lettuce are large. When I take my food home I have to chop up my lettuce some more because it's too large for my mouth. The portion of meat is a hit or miss. When employees are close to their leaving times and there is a long line, they have no problem complaining about it in front of customers. I suggest calling in before and picking up food. Wish the manager would address the customer service issues."}
{"text":"Worse place ever! I usually eat here because I work so close but the quality is not worth it! I usually order two tacos al a cart and the meat the put in your taco is equivalent to 1 tablespoon. While I walk through watching the employees put my food together I see they do not care about missing other veggies as they grab or drop them when compiling a dish. The kids who work here are extremely rude and impatient. Yesterday I ordered my food at 11:15 and was promised my food would be ready by 12:15. I arrived at 12 to ask what the status was and my food was still not ready. I did receive my receipt however I did not get my food until 12:45!!!!! Then I took my food back to my office and it was wrong!!! This has not been the first time where they got my order wrong!! Done with this place and the punk attitudes I get from the employees."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's a better cafe rio in the southwest!!! Much cleaner of course because it's newer but it's not sloppy like other locations. Food is delicious and portions are great. I share a salad with my husband and eat a vegetarian taco. My son eats about 3 shredded beef tacos which are great. I will definitely be back and will start using my stamp card again!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see this establishment being put in. We had tried it once before during a trip to California. The thing that sets them a part from the others are the freshly made tortillas. They make the food magical. The restaurant was clean. The employees were friendly. I went on Taco Tuesday. I had : 1 shredded Chicken taco, 1 shredded beef, rice, bean, and a fountain drink for $6.   The tacos were very good. The rice was good too. The black beans were the bomb though! I'll be back next Tuesday."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to pile on the hate-wagon and state that this is the worst Cafe Rio I have ever visited.  I have eaten at one or two dozen locations in different states, and I'm confident that the cleanliness, speed of service, and food quality here is the worst ever.  I won't even eat here anymore, it's that bad.  It's so bad, everyone in Hendo that I've spoken to completely agree with me every time.  I've even gave them 5-10 tries to do better.  No such luck.   Cold food, dirty, out of everything, slow, etc, etc.  Stay away and go someplace else.  You've been warned.  Update:  They seem to have finally got it together here and it's on par with the other locations."}
{"text":"Great food for the price.   Love that children under 6 get a free quesadilla when you purchase a meal and eat at the restaurant.  Love their salads.  My favorite thing is the Stevia sweetened Strawberry Lemonade.  I haven't been anywhere with stevia sweetened drinks on tap.  Super yummy and no sugar.  Gets super busy here during peak lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"For the kind of place this is, they are top notch.  They are quick and the ingredients are good.  I always get the same thing, a chicken salad.  The one thing that brings me back is their Stevia sweetened strawberry lemonade.  I try to drink only drinks with no sugar.  You can never really find anything anywhere except unsweetned iced tea.  And now, Cafe Rio has satisified a huge craving I have and sometimes I want to go just for the drink."}
{"text":"This place gets BUSY!  When we are in town to visit family, we always  have to make a stop at Cafe Rio and get our Barbacoa Salad fix.  This location is right in the center of a busy shopping area, so if you come here for lunch, come early.  We stopped here as a late breakfast early lunch at 11:30, and by the time we left the line was practically to the door!  Service was quick and efficient which is necessary in a busy location like this!"}
{"text":"I'm so appreciative of restaurants that serve farm-fresh food! I especially appreciate when a kitchen is on full display for customers to see what's cooking, allowing for full accountability. The food looked delicious!   And then I bit into it.   I got the sweet pork barbacoa enchiladas. My partner got the quesadilla with the same meat. Now, we saw the word \"sweet,\" and we thought: honey mustard sweet. Honey BBQ sweet. Maple glazed ham sweet. Honey bourbon chicken sweet. In other words, sweet PLUS savory/spicy/tangy. The balance can work really well and be scrumptious!   This was just sweet. Good lawdy, like it was doused in sugar. It wasn't a meat dish anymore, it was almost a dessert at that point! I should have gotten a hot sauce instead of mild. My partner had to douse his whole quesadilla in tabasco and Tapatio. He didn't finish and will use a lot of Sriracha on the leftovers. We'll finish our food because it certainly wasn't bad by any means, but that unexpected flavor was too off-putting for us to think of Cafe Rio as an option for lunch or dinner in the future. The customer should not have to correct the chef's recipe, and while I could tell the food was very fresh and wanted to like it more than I did, I'm afraid we'll be looking elsewhere for our Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I am surprised at all of these reviews...and the crazy long line and good reviews were \"false advertising\" for me.  We waited a while after struggling for parking on Friday night, and I had high expectations.  I got enchiladas with chile beef and tomatillo sauce with rice and black beans.    ...when the kid came around to ask how our meal was, the poor guy was not expecting to listen to a real answer I am sure....but he learned that I had both a hair in my food AND a clump of salt dumped into my enchiladas.  His offer: queso for my pain (no refund or free meal coupon).  I turned him down...after all, I lost my appetite and certainly won't be back.  Here is the deal - Just like Law and Order, THE ORIGINAL is the BEST...Chipotle cannot be topped..."}
{"text":"My review for the Eastern location shows I detest it and I pretty much never wanted to step foot in a Cafe Rio ever again.  However, it is near UNLV so I find it easy to walk there and most people around here like it for a quick lunch.  At first, I was partial to the Thursday special only - 2 chicken tamales with green sauce.  This is tasty and usually lasts 2 meals.  Yet once I found out how good the tortilla soup is, that is pretty much the only thing I get now.  It is made to order, and I get everything: shredded chicken, guacamole, cheese, pico, chicken broth with carrots and onion, and topped with (or on the side) cilantro sprigs, lime, and tortilla strips, with a warm tortilla on the side.  It is just over $4 and very satisfying.  Comforting grub.  Props for a variety of flavored iced teas and Mexican coke in non-crazy sized bottles.  That's all she wrote!"}
{"text":"What is the point of placing a take out order when they only start making it after you arrive and stand around for 5 minutes?  Terrible service and organization at this store, like many other reviews have stated.  I placed my order around 6:55 pm and it said it would be ready at 7:15.  I arrived at the store at 7:19 - no one was in front to greet me or get my order, I stood around for 5 minutes until someone finally acknowledged me and my order and said they were \"working on it,\" after some prodding they eventually admitted that they were just starting the order at 7:24 pm.  So they had my order for almost 30 minutes and finally decided to start it.  No thanks, never again."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disgusted with the service of this restaurant on their overall inconsistency then to be argued with. I have seen so many people walk out of this restaurant because of the service. Cafe rio corporate needs to step in and do something."}
{"text":"Good and fresh food, but the Employees make me NOT wanna come back, They seemed like they were Forced to work, I get it, its \"work\" and we would rather be binge watching Game of Thrones or Vikings, However, when you are customer Facing, try to be pleasant or at least don't   put on an upset face, for some reason, almost every single one of them looked pissed,"}
{"text":"Don't go there an hour before they close. They aren't too happy to serve you that late it felt like, and I got a salad and they were way more interested in pushing people through the line, that they didn't even give me any dressing for it. My husband really wanted horchata but it was already turned off and empty. I just think, if a place of business is going to stay open till 11, then they should offer everything they normally would at any other time of day. Or at least, give me salad dressing! They even had the guac put away and the guy had to get it out and make some more. The employees just looked done, and even seemed like they were getting on each others nerves. It was weird."}
{"text":"Horrible! Flavor was gross. Food was luke warm, at best. Restaurant and tables need more frequent cleaning. Would not recommend.  Update: Thank you for the private message from Cafe Rio telling me not to ever \"some\" back in again. Your grammar is as good as your food! LoL"}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly staff with smiles and welcoming attitudes. For such a busy restaurant it's always clean"}
{"text":"Great food! Not the americanized version of mexican food. The carne asada burrito with wheat tortilla and black beans is the best for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Cafe Rio I've ever been to. I ordered extra tortilla as I always do (from different locations) and it tastes worse than PlayDoh. It's dry, thin, and tastes like 90% raw flour. I took one bite of the tortilla and I immediately spit it out. What a waste of my money. I also ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it was so salty I could feel my lips shriveling. In my opinion, I wouldn't bother coming here and wasting your money. There wasn't anyone making the food and their system was more like they were just dumping food in containers. The cashier didn't give us our receipt and he even had the audacity to ask us if we wanted our change... Did the manager train him this way or is this how they run a business? What a shame to a good company. I should have believed the reviews before I came here... :( I hate to be a downer but this experience blew it for me here but I will definitely continue going to the centennial circle location."}
{"text":"Just had Cafe Rio for the first time last month and it changed my life. It was so good that I went again the next day and again two days later. Basically I came here three times in four days and I can eat this every day. I do online order a lot and the only gripe I have about this location is that my orders weren't ready at the promised pick-up time. Sometimes I had to wait around 15 minutes after I arrived to pick up my order and that practically defeats the purpose of online ordering since it was faster to actually go through the line. Their service is a bit lacking too but the food is good so I can overlook that. I pretty much stopped eating Chipotle after their incidence and I'm so glad to find a replacement. The only concern I have about the \"assembly line\" model is that I can't help but feel they are spitting in the food in front of them as they talk and ask the customers what they want etc. I wish they can wear a mask or something."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner online two (two taco plates) with NO rice and NO Beans to go. My husband picked them up and we got them home to find virtually NO sweet pork inside? I have eaten at other Cafe Rio's so I know how much sweet pork they usually put in. The bill for this sad disappointing meal was over 20 bucks! This location is so close but if this is what they offer... uh no."}
{"text":"food is wet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i loved mexican but what the fuck.. it took 25 mins to actually make a salad and it tasted like soup by the time I actually got my salad the meat was cold as hell.."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio food is delicious.. especially the salad. Unfortunately the staff seem to hate their job. Always looking upset and get annoyed when you request something on your PAYING meal."}
{"text":"I love the food at Cafe Rio! It's great portions and good prices! As much as I love the food I'm giving this particular location 3 stars because customer service was awful! I walked in to a busy joint but when you looked at the employees they weren't friendly and they looked like they hated their jobs. In fact one employee who worked on my tostada gave attitude to a fellow employee in front of me and other customers. I felt bad for the cashier because my order was incomplete as the employee who gave attitude forgot to give me dressing with my meal and I asked the cashier who seemingly was afraid to ask because of the attitude of one of the fellow employees. I was absolutely ashamed for this location because each employee didn't seem to smile or show any hospitality."}
{"text":"True to give them one more chance... Horrible service!!!! Meat was dry and VERY OLD!!! Never coming back to this location, it's a shame used to be a family favorite ;( the food is not what it used to be, sad but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Cafe Rio in LV. I was a little bummed today when I got a free meal and I didn't get my free meal call (which isn't a big deal) I jokingly said \"awwww no free meal call?\" (With a big smile on my face I was totally kidding too) the girl behind the counter says with an attitude \"you really want one of those?\" Then proceeds to roll her eyes. Everyone else was friendly and the good here is always great. I would've given it a five if it wasn't for the cashier."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is pretty consistent with their food. Shredded chicken burrito was very good. Employees were friendly and happily brought us our dessert while we were at our table. They were too busy to make it while we were at the register."}
{"text":"My husband and I love cafe rio. I've been to almost all of them in Utah but this cafe rio in particular isn't up to par with the other ones. The rice is usually overlooked or undercooked. No one there knows the proper way to present the tres leches by flipping on a small plate adding whipped cream and sliced strawberries. They just hand it to you in one of the tin containers with a plastic top. I even told them they didn't make it right and they had no idea what I was talking about. Anyway that's my rant."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a clean restaurant that has a meal for around $8. The sweet pulled pork is SO good! I've had the burritos & taco salad. They're so good I have those two things all the time."}
{"text":"How I am enjoying the pulled pork burrito today! The girl behind the counter excused herself to get new gloves.  The man in front of my asked for a burrito with habanero sauce on it. Which I kind of think means it was really hot! I guess I look like someone who has very tender taste buds. Being old has its advantages!"}
{"text":"Normally good service however tonight the staff was not as friendly or receptive to the request of the customers.   Again normally we love this place but tonight they weren't at top service.   Sad"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is kind of like Chipotle. You pick your type of entree (Burrito, tacos, quesadilla, etc.), your main ingredient (Pork, chicken, beef, or all vegetable), and fillings. The interior is spacious with lots of tables to choose from, although a lot of the tables here hadn't been cleaned and were slightly grimy when we came in.   I went with the chile shredded beef burrito, enchilada style. It was a gigantic burrito that barely fit in the container it was in, filled with beef, rice, beans, smothered with red chile, shredded cheese, and some pico de gallo on the side. The beef was well seasoned and I could taste the kick of chile in it. The other ingredients went well with each other and I liked the red chile sauce it was smothered with.  The drink selection is quite impressive, especially since they have free range aquas frescas. Unlimited horchata, all right! They also had a mojito limeade and two different lemonades in addition to iced teas and sodas at the drink fountain area.  Service was speedy and friendly. Overall this is a good option for fast food Mexican if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Hello Rio! Taking up residence where QDoba used to be, Cafe Rio offers some competition to the Chipotle across the street. I liked the meal I had at the other Tempe location so I was excited that this location was opening up closer to where I live.   The menu offers shredded chicken, beef, and pork, as well as steak and chicken strips in various forms such as burrito, taco, and salad. There are daily specials such as today's chicken tostada for a little less than $8.   I had a shredded chicken burrito, XMas style (Green and red sauce) with rice, black beans, and pico de gallo. It was gigantic, barely fitting into the container it was in. Overall I enjoyed the meal. The medium green chile sauce was slightly sweet, contrasting with the more savory flavor of the hot red chile sauce. All the ingredients were cooked well, and the pico de gallo was a deep red and very refreshing with the burrito. I would have liked an additional texture in the burrito, maybe some diced onion in the mix though.  Service was very friendly and speedy. They have an app you can sign up for that tracks your purchases and gives you rewards after you reach a certain number of points.  I think Cafe Rio is definitely a step up from the previous QDoba. I'll be back to try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Yea!! Love Cafe Rio and the options  Always great, great service. I love the  strip mall options, something for everyone and they can get thier burger next door while I get my Mexican fix!"}
{"text":"Very expensive. Poor customer service. Shredded chicken quesadilla was so bland. It just was not what I was expecting for $23. (We both had one)Cheese wasn't even melted, had to put back on conveyor belt. Maybe if they slowed down, and brought the food out to tables it would be better. Zaba's is a lot better."}
{"text":"Love that this place is child friendly and has little portions for the smaller children.  This is a great option for a lazy dinner night that is Great for the whole family! I personally enjoy the chips, salsa and queso for an appetizer.  Typically I have always had fresh chips that are warm and with the case so it feels like it melts in your mouth. Super delicious! The queso has some peppers in it but it's not overly powerful or spicy. You could certainly tweak it to make it more spicy with the salsa provided. I prefer to have it the way it is since my children often enjoy it too. Besides the casual atmosphere and to go option, this place is perfect for children because they offer mini quesadillas AT NO COST for the little ones. This includes an orange slice. If your children are like mine and eat like a bird then this may be more than enough for them to eat as the herb meal, however it's also a great appetizer for the kids that I think is a great addition to their meal. The fact that an orange slice is included makes me happy because it is adding another very important food group to the meal or snack; instead of just a greasy quesadilla. I will add that the quesadilla is not at all greasy but pretty delicious!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Not just for families but great for people who work nearby and looking for a tasty lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place in Vegas when I was out at EDC.  Decent Mexican food in the middle of the desert.  I got the chicken tacos and all of them were pretty good.  You get a plate of beans, rice, and your food from this place for ~$6.    A bright spot about this place - they messed up my order when I got here because I asked for just the chicken tacos but they gave me something else (I think it was steak instead).  They were so nice to me about fixing my order - they gave me the correct food and threw in beans/rice for free.  I'm always a fan of great customer service and free things, so when you throw in both I'm a happy camper and generous with my stars.  Definitely check this place out if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was a former employee of theirs, only for a couple days and worst job I've ever had!!!! Starters their lobby area is disgusting with stuck guac to the floor to queso on the window sills. The general manager never told me her name even though I asked her more than twice, the staff is rude to the guests on purpose and will hang up on people. The manager in training called me stupid I believe get name was VERONICA. They also over charge people on purpose. And oh yeah they STILL HAVEN'T PAID ME!!!!! Do not go here and I've been trying to get in touch with corporate and no calls back yet. Worst Mexican food place ever!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service here does not promote an environment that makes you feel welcome. Stopped by for lunch today to pick up food for my boyfriend only to be welcomed by employees who looked as though they were annoyed to be taking my order. They were young and I understand that, but even the manager was unprofessional and rude. The food is great but if you're looking for quality service go to the PV location, they are so much nicer!"}
{"text":"I've been to five Cafe Rio locations and I've decided that they all equally deserve my Yelp love. Yes it is a chain. But, in my humble opinion at least, their food is spectacular. I usually order a burrito with enchilada sauce. It never disappoints.  My friends and I particularly like this location after a hike at Mt Charleston."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cafe Rio location once. My cousin worked at the University at the time and it turned out to be the perfect place to meet up for lunch, especially since I'm a big fan and she had never tried it before.  As always, I ordered a burrito with enchilada sauce. I always mull over their menu looking for something new to try. When crunch time arrives, I seem to find myself settling for that. Settling is not quite the right word, though, because it is always delicious and satisfying."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio always hits the spot. Excellent burritos, especially if you get them with enchilada sauce. So far, I've had the Fire Grilled Chicken Breast and the Sweet Pork Barbacoa; they are both delicious. In the case of the latter, you might want to shy away from it if you don't want your food too sweet."}
{"text":"So I've actually been to five Cafe Rio locations. Let's be honest. It's a chain. But it's so good! Actually, since I'm being honest, I'm really only reviewing this location because I want to add it to one of my lists.  This Cafe Rio is the closest one to my job and is my location of choice when I feel like some great Mexican food during lunch time. Is it authentic Mexican food? I don't know anymore. Who cares? It's delicious! I usually get a burrito with enchilada sauce. I always walk out full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Don't order online and dont come here late - we were ignored then when we finally spoke up, they Couldn't find our order and now they said just give us 10 minutes ....horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"They got my order wrong after I explained it to them and once I left and got back to work to eat, I found a HAIR in my food. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Host# 132 Breaktime from 8:00 to 8:30 PM.. unbelievable! Sitting there eating with another coworker talking loud and using very vulgar language. F this! F that! And discussing how her hours are being cut do to her language and all the complaints she has against her.. our kids are overhearing all this as well as the family behind her.. What a knucklehead..  Food was good as always"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I like the new look but we won't be back again EVER. Came in for dinner with my family. We didn't get our side of pork that we ordered. We only got 3 of our 4 kids quesadillas. When we were done eating they finally brought out our 2 orders of chips and queso. BUT ONLY THE CHIPS. The queso never came. We asked for a refund and they refunded us for one. Then we had to ask for the second to be refunded!! Ruined our night. And their only excuse was 'sorry we're in the back doing inventory.' Really that's how you spend your time on Saturday at 5pm?? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that there is a new location by this area!  Cafe rio is a great Mexican restaurant at a pretty reasonable price. This is not an authentic Mexican restaurant but the food is still delicious. They are well known for their sweet pork and their enchilada style burrito. I would recommend to try the salad or the burrito although you won't be disappointed with anything you order here"}
{"text":"Even though this is not an authentic Mexican place, I love their food!!!  The plate's sizes are pretty big, the ingredients are fresh, and their service is pretty efficient.  Their winning and most popular plate is the pork burrito. This is not your typical carnitas, this is actually a sweet bbq pork. Although it sounds a bit weird is delicious. If you do not like pork you can always go for steak or chicken. However,  If you are looking for a most healthy alternative the salad is a great option. The portion is huge and contains a bit of everything, (guacamole, sour cream, beans rice and letters)"}
{"text":"This place was packed. I got the enchiladas and they were awesome. Barbacoa and shredded chicken with rice and pinto beans. Kids under 6 yrs eat free (Nino quesadilla)! I'll definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location Saturday night (3/18/17) at 9P. I was EXCITED to try the Saturday special fish/ shrimp tacos.... we wait in line,  and it's our turn to order.... i ATTEMPT to order the Saturday special when Im informed that they're out of both shrimp and fish and won't be cooking any more for the night....WEIRD because they're open for another 2hours. So, I ATTEMPT to order a taco salad with spicy pork.... I'm informed that they're out of that as well,  and won't be preparing more for the night....WEIRD, AGAIN they close at 11P. At this point I say forget it and leave.  I walk out of the establishment, but I was troubled by the lack of care soI go back in and ask to speak to the manager on duty.  The cashier informs me that the manager is currently on break and can't speak to me at the moment.  I WAS BAFFLED by the response,  so I asked her to repeat what she said,  so thatI could make sure I understood her correctly.  She repeated herself,  IN THE SAME GIGGLY WAY as if there was nothing wrong with the statement.  I asked for the number to corporate so that i could inform them of the BEYOND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE & LACK OF OVERALL CARE.  I see that this isnt an uncommon experience at this location, which is sad.  DRIVE FURTHER OUT FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE"}
{"text":"Never been to a Cafe Rio before, but this location is near my house and they mailed me coupons, so what the heck let's try it.  Tuesday evening about 6pm, probably 50 people in line in front of me, so an hour to get food.  The employees were moving with zero sense of urgency and there seems to be absolutely no management coordination.  There were two employees around the long line whose job seemed to be chitchatting with the customers, handing out menus, and helping people download their smartphone app.  What they should have been doing was getting behind the counter and pitching in.  Food was ok, by the time I got it I really didn't care anymore.  But hey, I decided to wait in that huge line, so partly it's on me.    Chipotle is a similar concept, much tastier, and motivated, happy employees and managenent, and they get you through the line in no time flat.  If I get anymore coupons maybe I'll go back....at off hours....on a weekday...and only with a coupon"}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Joel and a Hispanic gentleman with braces are very friendly and accommodating! They make the visit so much better, they truly know what customer service is and they are super quick so you get your yummy food fast. It's now my favorite place to eat- bye Chipotle!"}
{"text":"The management in this place must be horrendous. Every employee in the place seemed miserable, none of them even so much as smiled. I had to tell three different people which order was mine and they still managed to ignore me when I said i wanted pico. They were also out of corn tortillas so the only option for my enchiladas was flour. The guy that prepared my food hooked it up with the chile roast beef, otherwise I would have only given one star."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences with this chain in the past but this one is up there. I've walked out the past two times because they were out of rice. The first time they told me it would take 40 minutes to cook and the second time they said 10 minutes. Also, the staff, although not rude, also isn't friendly at all and some of the meats looked really dry. I will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot for causal mexican food that is good quality. I especially love that they hand-make all of their tortillas (you can watch through a window while you stand in line to order) and they have a HUGE selection of hot sauce in a little shelf unit by the knives, forks, and napkins. The only thing I am not crazy about is that the burritos only have cheese, rice, meat and beans wrapped inside, and everything else (lettuce, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo) is on the side, which forces you to eat the burrito with a knife and fork instead of holding it wrapped up in your hands. They do offer enchilada-style burritos which is pretty awesome. Solid mexican food restaurant that I will definitely return to."}
{"text":"Food was decent but nothing spectacular.  WAY overpriced for what you get.   Additional charges from menus prices for everything, but they don't tell you it is additional.  Won't be back here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. The employees wanted to move onto the next customer before they were even done with my order. And then an employee obviously needed help finishing up my mom and I's orders because they were pretty backed up but they just ignored him. Also very unclean line. I get it. it's fast food. but have some decency to clean your soda machine, your line, and your lobby. Food wasn't as hot as it should be due to my food sitting there waiting for them to actually help me. Rice tasted stale and food didn't look fresh at all. AND THEN. while i was in line a man from postmates or whatever put his phone over the glass! and the employee just let him and asked him to do it again so she could see the order better. UMMM HELLOOOOOO WHAT IF HIS PHONE FALLS IN THE FOOD OR HIS NASTY DEAD SKIN CELLS GET IN THE FOOD OR HE HAS SOMETHING ON HIS HANDS. HEALTH CODE VIOLATION HERE COME ON. chipotle would never let that happen and It's a no from me!"}
{"text":"2 taco meal with sweet barbacoa pork, $8.38 with tax. You'll never eat at Chipotle ever again."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good Mexican food at a decent price.  The food is consistent and you always know what to expect.  As long as there isn't a line it's pretty fast since the food is made similar to Subway's assembly line of pre made foods.  I pretty much just always get the pork salad but their other stuff is pretty good too."}
{"text":"OMG the Pork Barbacoa Salad is to die for!!! You can't really go wrong in this little strip mall with Firehouse Subs, Patsy Grimaldi's, Nielsen's, and Freed's... But I'd have to say Cafè Rio is my fav.   They make the toritllas fresh daily, and the \"shell\" they put their humongous salad in is nothing short of fantastic. It's a thicker version of their dinner plate size flour tortilla, with a little melted cheese on top. And after your first endevour with this lettuce pork tortilla strip and pico de gallo masterpiece, when you reach the \"shell\" after the salad is all gone... Whoa! You'll wish you hadn't waited so long. Paired with the Creamy Tomatillo dressing and their Hot Salsa Fresca, you'll never think about ordering another taco salad elsewhere ever again.  Kudos to Cafè Rio for keeping it real... Real fresh!!"}
{"text":"Staff was great last time we were there . Love the queso . Wish it were a little bit cheaper . But still go . Love that they do free quesadilla for kids under 2."}
{"text":"Decided to close early on 02/07/2016. It's annoying that you drive somewhere with the expectation that they will be open because that's what the hours of operation claim, yet they decided to close early because it was \"slow\"(Asked an employee who was taking out the trash). We asked her if we could still order food because they were supposed to be open. She said, \"sorry we put the food away\". Overall I'm annoyed."}
{"text":"i came here after a practice w a friend. she told me how wonderful it was and how i need to try the flipping salad. so i said fine and we went. the line was super long so it took a hot minute. as we were waiting in line the older men workers kept staring at my friend and being assholes and whispering to each other. we both lost our appetites and were just to annoyed and disgusted to eat. terrible customer service. it's bad enough that it's not worth a $10 salad... even if it is pretty great."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times. Their food is very good. I have not been disappointed even once. Their service is another subject completely. I do not believe this place is very well managed. They get backed up at the register always.  The line simply won't move because the cashier is busy with the phoned in takeout orders too.  They have come up with little songs for when people order extra cheese. That's very annoying, it is not entertaining. They are constantly yelling to each other orders, and joking around. They are having a very good time, and that's all fine and well, but the focus is not on the customer. They really need to find a way to speed the line up.  They need to refresh the food, and don't let the food in each container fall into the other containers. I don't want random beans in my guacamole. The person running the grill today had burned cheese all over it, and through my tortilla right on top of that. It was careless and lazy. It somewhat grossed me out. When I mentioned the lettuce seemed really big, and not chopped, he threw my salad behind him in the garbage and started over. It was very unprofessional, and the customers around me all noticed. We all looked at each other like oh my gosh!  Somebody needed to take a break, or just get the heck out of there. I will keep trying this place because I like their food. Hopefully somebody with a professional food industry background will be hired to properly manage this place."}
{"text":"Dear Cafe Rio, on a Friday night at 7 you probably want to have more workers. 35 mins standing in line is ridiculous. The main worker is nice and pleasant and I would rather stand in line and have it be slow than the previous Mexican worker that moved too fast and didn't ever listen to what you were saying. Also, cashier seemed to hate her job. Also, why is the floor always dirty?"}
{"text":"This place needs a manager that is on the floor (CiCi) and a more organized way of doing things!!! One star because Shannon was so wonderful, professional and went out of her way to make sure everything was right. No salmon at 12pm!! Are you kidding me? It's the lunch time rush and I had to wait 20 minutes extra for them to cook it! Everyone is running around with no clue how to serve customers. I will be visiting the Centennial Cafe Rio from now on!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with two of my friends. First time going to this location, normally go to the one on lake mead. There weren't busy but were rushing us with our orders and when I asked for them to put my nachos back in the oven to melt the lady sighed and then went to put it back when I then asked if she would take the sour cream of first. She lazily scraps a little off and then gives me a nasty look. The only reason I gave it three stars was because they actually had all ingredients to make tres leche. I work in customer service and these employees need to remember the PAYING customer is always right. Do what they ask with a smile."}
{"text":"Go to another location! Do not go here! I live right around the corner a will be not coming back. The service at this place has taken a huge dive and is not getting any better. I have just picked up my \"to go\" order which again was wrong, then I ask that them to remake and the attitude I was given was horrible! So sorry to have you create the CORRECT order. The food is great and the service is the worst."}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially the nachos and the salads.  The line can be long and slow at times, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome service and the food is ggggggggreat! They made everything to my liking and the guac... Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time in a while. Employees are nice and friendly. Food was good, besides the fact I saw one of the workers mix new beans in with the old beans instead of switching out the whole container (which is what is supposed to happen according to standards?) the old container was all crusty with old beans and looked like it hadn't been changed all day.. So yeah. As you would guess I didn't get beans . But I'm sure there's been worse. Other than that everything was ok."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just the day Cinco de Mayo, but the staff was frazzled.  I know it's a fast food place for Mexican food but the food preparer was just sloppy.  So what if there was a line forming out the door,  they couldn't still taken the time to make my burrito nicely.  I think I was discouraged watching my food being prepped that I actually lost my appetite by the time I made it to the cashier.  and the worst thing was they ran out of Horchata!! I think I'll just go across the street to Filiberto's that serves authentic Mexican food at a much better price and customer service.  We can take this place off my \"go to\" list."}
{"text":"Eh.  More like 2 1/2.  It just wasn't what I am used to as far as \"Mexican\" or whatever the proper descriptor of this cuisine is.  The decor is kind of cool, but other than that I'm not sure it's worth the money.  Really, what is these days?"}
{"text":"This place is not what it used to be. They went up in price and down in quality and service. I ordered the salad and The lettuce was not even covering my plate. The dining area was filthy.  We did not come at a busy time... several staff were standing around chatting while half of the tables were covered in food Scraps and the floors were nasty. Sad experience."}
{"text":"Great regional chain spot, it's always a good lunch spot.  This particular location recently went through a remodel and is a lot larger and service is a bit quicker now.  The lunch line can get pretty long here though, so be prepared but it usually moves pretty fast.  The food is decent, my two favorite things here are the shredded chicken salad with the house creamy dressing and also the chicken burrito enchilada style!  Both are very tasty and the ingredients are consistent everytime I come here.  The enchiladas aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"yesterday I ordered shredded chicken in my burrito and I BITE INTO A HUGE BONE!!! You can see the  attached -if a 5 years old was biting into this bone or swallow that it's was ending totally different!!!!  Also this guy (look at my photos) have a serious attitude and I am not sure if I and my work colleagues will never come back because of him."}
{"text":"Try the sweet chili pork tacos! Best thing on the menu. Also they offer the El Niño which is a cheese quesadilla for my youngest son who can be a picky eater which is great because the El Niño is free. Great place!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is like a partner in a co-dependent relationship that keeps you coming back for more abuse. Many things are great and some are not so fantastic. For example, their Horchata drink is amazing. True to the original recipe, they use condensed milk to add thickness and sweetness. Unfortunately after two 30oz refills, I found out how lactose intolerant I really am. Their drink mixing machines seem to always be broken (at every location in Vegas) so here's a PRO TIP: Ask an employee to manually stir the mix in the the container so you get the best ratios of cinnamon, horchata mix, water, and sweet milk.  The menu is a little bit sneaky. You think you're ordering the $8 dollar burrito but then the cashier asks you for $12.75 and you wonder if you have entered the Twilight Zone. She then explains with a smile that you ordered the steak which has a $1.50 up charge. You also ordered it \"Wet\" which adds another dollar or so. She backs up her claim by pointing at the very tiny print on the side of menu.  You pay the penalty knowing that you're gonna get your frequent purchaser card stamped that day. After 10 entrees, you're going to redeem yourself with a free meal. That meal will consist of the very item that you are too cheap to order normally. Victory!  I normally get the Shredded Chicken Burrito \"Wet Style.\" They place your choice of hot sauce and melted cheese on top. It's run through the oven and comes out like a big enchilada that's ready to eat. I usually overstuff it with all they free items. Beware guacamole and sour cream trigger extra charges. For $1 they give you a small teaspoon sized portion.    Cafe Rio is very tasty compared to the dog food that they serve at Chipotle. But it's not as good as a genuine Mexican Restaurant. However, you feel safer here than in a hole in the wall place. They offer a good balance of franchise corporate place with the feeling of a family owned restaurant. You don't feel like your food is being made with old or expired ingredients.  BEWARE: their restaurants only seem to have one restroom per gender & only one toilet each. Not a smart move for a Mexican food place in America. Especially since their locations seem to be around high schools and colleges. Those youngsters are still developing their digestive systems. 4 ounces of melted cheese, sour cream, beans, and salsa will create problems in most sophomores.  I will continue to visit Cafe Rio but I will avoid the horchata. I will also make sure that I'm near a commercial toilet that provides a powerful vacuum flush. It won't be onsite because their restrooms are usually occupied by employees or newbies to the world of Mexican inspired cuisine. Their young palate is still developing. On a final note, the staff is generally nice and will serve you with a smile. They choose locations with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews for this place.  I've been here a handful of times and usually the service is not too bad.  This current experience i ordered food online so that i could pick it up.  My fiancé is pregnant and was tired so we figured if we order the food we could just come in, pick up and go. This was not the case.  When i came in when the order was due to be ready the staff members said it will only be a couple more minutes because they are making it right now.  I would prefer the food to be ready when it says to pick it up, but as long as it's within 5 mins i don't mind waiting.  15 mins later I ask again if my food is ready. They said \"yes it's being made right now\".  I ask again 5 mins after this. Then they say \"What was your order?\". I tell them my order and they said that they lost it and will need to make it again.  So another 10 mins and finally my order is ready. All i ordered was a soup and tortilla . Waiting almost 40 mins while my pregnant fiancé is sitting in the car waiting is not acceptable.  I would give this place a 1 star but because of my previous experiences brought it up to a 3. I would love this place to fix the pick up window so food would actually be ready when the order says it is"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and the food is really good but this location is horrible. They always run out of salmon I went for a whole month once a week on my day off and I only got to eat my salmon salad once because they always run out. To make matters worse they don't even bother putting out a sign and I waited in a long line for them to tell me they had no more salmon it was 1 in the afternoon. Its insane to me how they can run out. Today I absolutely had to yelp them because I stood in a long line and finally gave up and left. I left because I got close enough to realize why the line was so slow and long because they ran out of tortillas. What kind of mexican restaurant runs out of tortillas. Once again nothing was said to anyone in line. The line came to a complete stop while they tried to make the dough. Then they would throw the dough away and start again lokking and looking at the recipe. I just don't understand its friday night you should expect to be busy. I will say this it was the last time ill ever go to this location I will go an extra 10-15 minutes away to the centennial location from now on. I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly. The menu selection was very fresh. The line moves quickly as you tell them what you would like at each section. My fav was the tortillas. Lots of seating with very vibrant interior."}
{"text":"We came in about 30 mins to closing. I get it they're closing and might be out of stuff. But they were out of the daily special, which is the only reason I came here in the first place. So I settled for a vegetarian burrito. Which is fine I like that. Everything looked very disorganized and kinda dirty. But I decided to go through with ordering anyway because I like the food here. When we got to sit down and start eating I took my first bite into my burrito and it was cold!!! I was shocked. This has never happened to me here before. I went to see if I could get warmed up. I decided to just get a quesadilla instead because I feared the beans with be cold again. I got a chicken quesadilla, they were cool about it. No problems. It wasn't until I began to eat the quesadilla. And it was completely saturated in juice. It was a soggy greasy messy. The cheese wasn't even completely melted. I didn't even bother to finish eating it. I'm am so disappointed in this location I have never had bad food at cafe rio, but this was horrible. The staff could have been friendlier as well."}
{"text":"Yes Cafe Rio is a chain. OMG it's a CHAIN location for Americanized Mexican food! Let's all freak out and write bad reviews bashing chains! Not this review, not today. Hendertucky is short on good places to eat the further South on the 95 that one goes. And sometimes you just want fresh salsa, spicy queso, enchiladas, or a chicken salad on a day when you don't want to heat up the kitchen to cook something or drive 25 minutes or more to get it. Cafe Rio's newest location is a nice addition to the Southeast corner of Henderson...and after a couple of visits I've found a lot to like.   It's very important to note that this location was working with corporate trainers until the first week of September 2014. The trainers are gone, and the staff I saw tonight on Thu 09/03/14 despite having a line 20 deep was smiling and downright hustling to get the food out. I called in an order for 4 people with everything from chips, guac, and queso to tacos, enchiladas and a chicken salad. Yeah I had to wait an extra 10 minutes past the time I was told my food would be ready. But rather than be a jerk about it I looked at the staff and watched as they busted their rear ends to get the food out. The ONLY complaint any of us had with our entire order was the chips were not finished correctly. But again this is a new location...and it takes time to work out the service kinks. So before people start doing their best Gordon Ramsey H***'s Kitchen imitations perhaps they should remember it takes time to get a restaurant, chain location or not up to speed. A little kindness and patience goes a long ways.   4 Stars. Service with a smile from the staff, order accuracy, salsa with some bite to it, and $40 worth of food enjoyed by everyone in this house has me going with 4 stars without the slightest hesitation.   One more thing...the manager I talked to tonight...was going above and beyond to provide great customer service with comps and apologies and giving good feedback to the team to improve service delivery on the spot. I won't give 5 Stars this time around...but I did entertain the thought as I typed this based on my observations."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  I remember when I was at the Missionary Training Center in Utah how the guys there that were from Provo used to rave about how awesome Cafe Rio is and how much they missed it.  When I moved out here and saw Cafe Rio I was pretty excited.  I waited in the insanely long line and was rushed through the cafeteria.  It was difficult to get just what I wanted because of the rushed atmosphere.  The food was average and the atmosphere is nothing to write home about either.  Overall, I was disappointed because I wanted something more authentic."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different locations over the years; and, would usually give Cafe Rio 5 stars.  It's not that the staff was unfriendly; but, I didn't feel that warm happy friendly welcome I usually get - it felt more rushed and careless.  When we got home, the rice in our enchiladas was not cooked all the way... so, we threw most of them away.    Just a little disappointed.... the tea was delicious; but, I don't know if it will be my first pick, in the future."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  Now the employees are short, rude and provide poor service.  My burrito wasn't rolled and the guy half assed it.  The whole experience was horrible.  This will be my last time coming here.  Chipotle here I come."}
{"text":"NEVER get anything to go. It's a soggy disgusting mess. My quesadilla literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up. It was a soupy soggy mess."}
{"text":"Horrible people with a side of a horrible serving. When you spend a good amount of cash for that food, you expect it to treat you well. I expected something good, but I received a nice long hair curled inside of my burrito as far as you could imagine. First of all, that is extremely gross. 10d dollars for that! Than I really got to see the extreme ruthlessness and disrespect these employees carry inside. I went back to explain my problem, they just played it of like it wasn't their hair when the manager talking to us carried hairs identical to what was in my food. Then this employee refused to give my plate of food back to me. That is my property and proof of what was in my food!    OVERALL THUMBS DOWN OR NO THUMB AT ALL   0%       I feel horrible after what has been in my mouth and the way my family and I have been treated. This is not the way to go.        And honestly they don't deserve a star at all!                            ( courtesy of an innocent guy named Raghav)"}
{"text":"Ok they get 3 stars because their food was actually delicious however I have an allergy to avocado and I saw that there was guacamole spilled into the sour cream container so I asked the very nice girl making our food if she could please get my sour cream out of a different container she didn't and just went around the guacamole that was in the sour cream well naturally I went to take a bite and immediately saw avocado my husband was so upset and immediately brought it to the staffs attention and they remade my food as quickly as they could and apologized but I could have had a very very serious reaction. They didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the matter. I haven't decided if we will come back to this location."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Came here with a freind for dinner and we both ordered the fire roasted chicken salad. The people working the line seemed more interested in side conversations than paying attention to orders or how they were serving food. As they were assembling my salad, I noticed that the lettuce was sitting in water (gross) and appeared very wet as they rushed it out without adequately draining it and added it to my salad. I was uneasy about this and should have rejected it at this point but as they were trying to speed everyone through the line, I hoped that it wasn't as wet as I thought it was going to be.  Well, after we sat down to eat, I examined the salad and there was about half an inch of water pooled up in the bottom of the salad. Not appetizing. I could not eat it so I brought I back to the counter and explained that the lettuce had been too wet when added in and ruined the salad and I asked that it be replaced with a bowl sans lettuce. A very nice girl at the take out counter took it back to the line and showed it to the manager, who initially refused to remake it and told her to take it back to me, saying the excess water wasn't from the lettuce, it was sauce from the rice and beans. So she brings it back to me and tries to get me to accept it....I repeated my request for a fresh bowl  as you could tell the liquid was watery and not from the rice and beans....I was really surprised that manager would try to brush off a polite request for a disgusting watery salad to be remade...they finally provided a replacement bowl but this line manager was very rude and dismissive about it. I could tell he didn't give a flying f about customer service. The chicken, rice and beans and dressing had a decent flavor but I had already lost my appetite from the soggy mess I was served in the first place.  The place is jam packed with young families with multiple bratty children who run unchecked throughout the dining area screaming and flailing around, and on top of that was very unkempt with trash cans overflowing despite the fact there were a ton of employees around. I can't imagine that I'd ever want to go back."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is just ok for me. The food itself isn't bad. I order the barbacoa burrito if friends or co-workers are going there, but I don't go out my way to eat there. I picked up some to go orders and the items ordered were there. Unfortunately my past experience ordering with them has been hit and miss. Sometimes the dressing for the salad is missing, extra meat charged was not added, and/or specific items not to be added like no beans or cilantro were added anyways. For the price you pay,  you would want the food to be correct. Service is ok, but sometimes it feels like you have to talk really loud on the ordering line because it's loud in the restaurant. All in all, better than your average fast food spot, but won't be going out of my way to order."}
{"text":"Disgruntled staff. Normally I love cafe rio, but this team is unmotivated and miserable. They aren't happy to be there, and even more unhappy that I showed up to order a burrito.  Back when they first opened, I was excited to finally have a cafe rio near my house. And now I'm so sad, because the employees ruin the experience with their attitude."}
{"text":"I keep giving Cafe Rio a try. Different locations, different times, and different ordering methods, but somehow something is still wrong. I've ordered by phone, online and in person hoping to ensure of these methods will give me correct order, but nope. I ordered a salad with extra meat, chicken and steak, and since the meat is always on the bottom of their salads, you would have to open the box move half of the lettuce on top and dig around to make sure it is correct, ain't nobody got time for that. So, I take the order home and lo and behold only one type of meat when I paid extra for two. *sigh*  Gave them another try. Had a large multiple order to go. Asked to purchase the creamy tomatillo dressing as an extra for a burrito, lady tells me over the phone, they don't have a tomatillo dressing only the house vinaigrette. Informed the lady on the phone I just placed 6 orders of salads with the tomatillo dressing and it's on their website, but I'm calling because I had a separate order. Insisted no dressing. Picked up order and dressing for 6 salads there and the vinagrette I didn't want. Food is just ok, store and phone lines are always busy, only go if I have to, but wish they would improve on order accuracy."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had a bad experience at this location, but it was so frustrating!   I informed Associate #1 that I was ordering a salad. Before I could say anything else, he proceeded to throw a tortilla on the flattop with cheese. When he walked back, I had to inform him that I didn't want cheese. He just looks at me, then turns around, throws a container on the tortilla, and turns back around. Trying to be helpful, I asked my fiancé what he was ordering and it was also a salad, so I told Associate #1 that he would take that tortilla. No response. Oookay. So I quickly tell him, \"I'm having a vegetarian salad\" before he could assume anything else. Also, since it was Thursday, there was a tamale meal special that I hadn't tried. I wanted to give them a whirl, so I asked Associate #1 if I could order one as a side item, since I didn't want the meal. He seemed confused and I asked a couple different ways, but he eventually answers, \"Yes.\"   Then, it's on to Associate #2. She seems nice enough, until I ask her a question, then she appears obviously annoyed. I say yes to all the vegetables, but no cheese. She asks me what type of dressing I want and as I'm attempting to formulate a sentence to indicate the dressing that is Vegan-friendly (I couldn't remember the name of either of them and she didn't tell me what they were, but just kept asking me which one I wanted), she starts scooping the creamy one into a cup. I'm like, \"Um, ah, uh, I meant the other one...the Vegan one???\" While trying to point through the glass. \"It's vinaigrette.\" Right. Then she just tosses it haphazardly to Associate #3, but it lands in the tortilla strips compartment. Nice.   While she's finishing up, I began to wonder where was my tamale?  Me: Um, I ordered a tamale in the side.... Associate #2: Did you tell him? (pointing at Associate #1) Me: Yes. Associate #2 to Associate #1: Did you get the tamale ready for her? Associate #1 has the look of \"Oh crap, I forgot\" on his face and gets it together. Associate #3 was great and asked if I wanted sides with the tamale (rice, beans, pico, and lettuce). Sure, why not. I also asked for no cheese.  Now, we are at the cashier. Cashier: Sure you don't want two tamales? It's the same price for one. Me: Uhh, what??? I asked the guy if I could order a tamale on the side and he said I could. Cashier: Oh. Weird. So you want the other one? Me: Um, okay...well, yeah. If I'm paying for it, I might as well.  We sit down and I'm pretty annoyed. I've barely started eating when the cashier walks over to bring us the tamale. Cashier: (as she is handing us the tray) Oh, did you want cheese on that? Me: (staring at the obvious, melted cheese on the tamale): Uhhhh... Cashier: If you don't want it, that's fine. We can make another one. Seriously, why would you bring it over with cheese on it and THEN ask me? Or better, why didn't anyone bother to ask Associate #1 or Associate #2 about how I had ordered the first tamale just a couple minutes prior?  So $25 and one (disgusting) tamale later, I didn't finish my food and Ieft feeling disappointed and dissatisfied (really, two tamales and two salads for $25 with bad service, no thank you). Additionally, for a salad I typically love, I had absolutely no desire to eat it tonight nor will I want to again in the future. For an establishment that has the appearance of promoting Vegetarian and Vegan options, it seems to be a bother to every associate to request NO cheese melted on the tortilla and NO cojita cheese (and cilantro, which Associate #2 also didn't bother to ask me if I wanted or not) topping my salad. If I hadn't received such amazing service in the past where associates have asked me whether or not I wanted certain items or concerned themselves with what I want on my meal, then this experience wouldn't have stood out so much."}
{"text":"This place it's a sad excuse for a fast food restaurant. After standing in line for 10 minutes waiting for someone to greet us. A total of 8 Associates are standing behind the counter looking at us and muttering \"who is going to help them\". After the yelling match between two Associates one came over to help us out. After we got our food we looked around for a clean table... (a restaurant with 30 or more tables to sit at NOT one was clean rice is on the floor, and tortillas were just hanging off the trash can it was pretty disgusting) and for only being two other families besides ours in the restaurant that's pretty sad.  Just watching the Associate's behind the counter totally shows they don't care about there jobs at all. One associate was eating food with his bare hands and talking to it looks like one of the manager's while being the cashier at a time and not washing his hands afterwards.   Not only will I never come back to a Cafe Rio I truly hope someone calls the health department. And takes away their letter grade because that was disgusting."}
{"text":"So I have always loved and always will love cafe rio for their authentic fresh food. But my goodness, this cafe rio could use plenty of improvements. First of all, any time i go to cafe rio for take out, it usually takes me a good 25-30min until I get my food. I have even called in on multiple occasions and they have never had my food ready. So I gave up on calling in. They seem to go through workers quickltly, which is a shame because if customer service continues not to improve, management must not be doing what they need to. I will say I love the new look and i just wish the service had been improved as well. I really hope customer service improves, because honestly I went to a Costa Vida drive through at san tan, and i would much rather go there now instead."}
{"text":"Bad service the food was aweful and the workers need to be more educated about their food and menu and be more friendly and use common sense. I asked them which orders were what and they looked and said they didn't know don't you so they didn't mark the items at all so my family and I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out which was ours!  This restaurant need to take notes from the one on warm springs very perfessional!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Cafe Rio, it was one of my favorite places to enjoy a Barbacoa salad. I will never go there again.  The decor change was not the only thing that has changed.  The food was less than tasty. Everything had changed, less quantity, less flavor, less friendliness by employees. An employees was wiping trays near the trash receptacle with a rag. She did have a bucket near her but never dipped the rag in it, just kept wiping trays.  I thought she was going to take them to the back room to load in a dishwasher. NO, she put them on the counter where the food comes off the prep line.  I spoke with the manager who said this was their practice and these only had to wash and steam the trays at the end of the shift. I told her I felt it was a health cold violation, it is cold and flu season and I just witnessed her employee wiping germs from one tray to the next. She was less than friendly and enformed me that her employee was using sanitizer that was in the bucket. I told her the employee never dipped her rag in the bucket as she wiped a whole stack of trays.  One of my favorite lunch spots is forever blacklisted."}
{"text":"I come to cafe rio often, like 2-3 times a week. Love the food. It's laid back enough that I can take my 2 year old daughter. I give it a 1 star because of their customer service. It's horrible. Not by all employees but most. At one point every time I came and picked up my food my order was always wrong. The employee in the food line never properly greets you. They look miserable. I have heard many times in standing in the line about similar issues from other people. I have even called this store a few times to tell a manager about how I found bones in my chicken and how my order was once again wrong. I also noticed each time I come I owe a new amount of money. I get the SAME exact thing every time. So I saved 6 recipes and yep prices ranged from $6-$22 nuts.  Also depending on who's working you will get a stamp on your stamp card. Then when I question why I don't get a stamp I get a rude response and told to have a great day.  Anyways I never write these things but I'm completely frustrated and sadly prob won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the food, I'd never come here. Each visit I make, the staff becomes less and less professional. No line when I walk in, but have to wait for a few mins for 10 people to look at me and no hellos or acknowledgement that I will be helped soon. They help get my food done fast. Then have to wait a min for the cashier to finish wiping trays for her to help me as a few more employees pass by goofing around. I get employees here are kids, but I guess it's better than my previous visit when the cashier was rude. As I ate my food, their phone rang and rang as about 5 employees yell \"get the phone\". Apparently nobody takes initiative here. I certainly wouldn't hire anyone that has worked here based on their work ethics."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious !! Had a super yummy steak quesadilla and everything  was simply perfect! The kids quesadillas  were delicious. Place is  clean and super good service! Oh and don't  get me started on the tres  leches it was amazing!"}
{"text":"The good: Fire-grilled chicken and steak, queso  The bad: everything else. The prices are higher than average for the whole \"burrito assembly line\" theme, and the salsa absolutely sucks, and by sucks I mean it literally made me want to vomit. The tortillas are so thick that the food just seems dry and bland. Overall pretty disappointing..."}
{"text":"Absolute terrible service. Everybody was all over the place making a mess. Small line took for ever due to one person working while the other employees watched her. Employees lost my order then when going to remake the order tell me they are all out of some ingredients to fill the original order. Employee then gives me attitude and Did not even tell me sorry for there mistake. Very disgusted in this place."}
{"text":"Figured I'd try this place as my job had it catered one day, and it was good. Ordered online and come home to find they left off part of my order. Wasn't going to go back, so just made do. However, food left something to be desired. Quality was not there. Order extra steak, and I had maybe 10 bites of steak in my whole bowl. $35 bucks wasted."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location two stars instead of one just because I love cafe rio so much.   I downloaded this app just to make a review and this will also be my first review of anything ever.   The last 4 times I have been to this location the service has got progressively worse. The first two times it didn't have anything to do with me and both times it was the same Asian employee. 3rd time the white kid with tattoos on his arms who might be a semi new hire and the 4'8\" Mexican lady that usually runs the cash register we the ones to  blame. 4th time was the most ridiculous visit. I walk in and there is only one person in line and he was getting steak nachos and asked for extra steak, which they were out of. He said he would wait because it looked like the steak was almost done cooking on the grille. I wanted a steak salad and I said I would wait as well. The front line person told the kid on the grille who's name I want to say is Jason or Chris that we need steak. Just so happened the two people behind me wanted steak also so at this point the whole line was stopped and everyone was just awkwardly standing there. So the front line lady told the grille cook again that we really need that steak right now and he just nods his head. I work in the industry and I know how people's misconception of time is so ill try to be very accurate. About 1.5 min later he starts slowly taking the meat off and putting it into a metal container, which I understand it need to cook all the way. He then proceeded to go into the back and get a new container of mean and then loads the grille up with the raw meat. At this point everyone is getting super aggravated. The front line lady tells him again that we need the steak asap. He slowly washes his hands and puts gloves on and then a metal glove over the food service glove and then a plastic glove over the metal. So it's been about 2-3 more min sense he put the raw meat on and then he starts seasoning it and waits about 30second and then he starts slowly and I mean slowly flipping the meat!!! The girl then again asks him for the steak now and he finally starts chopping it up. At this point there is about 12 people behind me.   Sorry for the rant and if anyone from cafe rio is reading this I hope it was as painful to read as my experience was."}
{"text":"Like other have said the service want great. There was nobody in line and 7 workers yet I walked up to order and waited over a minute before I was acknowledged. The girl was friendly though. When I got to the register there was nobody to help me bc someone was on the phone taking an order. The burrito was not very good. I had the pulled chicken one and the chicken and tortilla were fine but some of the rice was hard. I have never had hard rice in a burrito in my entire life. We will not go back."}
{"text":"I don't understand how you can't cook rice correctly ? Half the rice in my burrito was hard. Other flavors are okay but you can't serve Mexican food and not properly cook rice."}
{"text":"Back in town for a conference and tots was the first place I went. There are no Cafe Rio's east of Denver, which is a crying shame. It was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, but today they get one star for being of of their spicy pork at lunch time after I waited 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Cafe Rio since they are practically non-existent in California.  I was very disappointed because I thought their food quality would be similar to Chipotle's but it's not.  I ordered grilled chicken tacos and the chicken was burnt and bland.  Mostly everyone in my group complained about the quality of their food.  It is located in a new suburb where there aren't many restaurants so I think that's why it's still open, but we certainly won't be back!"}
{"text":"First, the staff is amazingly guest friendly. They do it with a sincerity and genuinely want you to enjoy yourself. Aces in my book , you don't show an interest in the people who come to eat at your restaurant they won't be coming long.   I had the salmon tacos- simply brilliant! Love a good fish taco. They have the usual table set up where you can pick and choose what you want on them- oh yeah! I also had chips salsa and guacamole . Enough chips to share. If only they served beer or a margarita to go with. Oh well can not have everything.   Open food prep and kitchen area means one thing to me cleanliness is next to everything you do. This place is orderly and crisp.   First time here won't be the last. Why did I wait so long to find this little gem"}
{"text":"Love the food, but this cafe rio ruins it, sometimes their \"shredded beef\" isn't shredded at all, sometimes it tastes like nothing, and they are almost always out of something! So frustrating when you're really hungry and they don't have what you want! They need to get themselves together and always have back up chicken once it runs out or anything else!"}
{"text":"This cafe rio almost always smells like bathroom.. customer service is also very shitty, even the managers are rude.. not going here ever again"}
{"text":"I agree with Brandon L.  Costa vida, chipotle, and any other for that matter beats cafe rio hands down.  I have tried and tried to listen to my utah friends who rave about this place and have been there at least 3 times and have now decided that i will not go back anymore.  i think people are blinded by the hype of what people say and if you actually taste the food you know that it isn't good.  plus i hate ad ons.  enchilada style $1, sourcream $2, guacomole $2.  i am surprised they don't charge me for the beans, rice and tortilla.  i am already paying $8 bucks for the buritto, why do i have to pay for everything else that goes with it.  truth is it is a utah thing.  if your not from utah you won't like it. just like those not from from australia cant handle veggiemite."}
{"text":"I am honestly very surprised as to this location's average 3 Star rating. I have eaten here countless times since they opened and LOVE their food!! I have tried everything from their salads to the flan, though in most occasions I stick with my usual-a pulled pork and cheese quesadilla. Their pulled pork is a must have!      Moving to the negatives of Cafe Rio, if you order on line, check your order when you pick it up because it is not always correct. Also, the regular line to order can be very long and sometimes move slowly, depending upon who is working.    Personally, I think the food is worth the wait, but long lines aren't preferable for many people."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!!!!  Honestly, who makes SWEET cheese enchiladas?  I took three bites and threw the rest away.  Authentic?  I think not.  I will keep searching for the best mexican food in town until I find it..."}
{"text":"One particular cashier had the best customer service. I got a wet burrito for the first time but I think I'll stick to the salad (habanero tasted more sweet than spicy.)  I've been to different locations and although this one seemed to have cleaner tables there was no where to sit for my family of 4. Idefinitely don't like the new set up. Changed our experience here. I'll also take in consideration it was a busy Sunday."}
{"text":"BAD Service, GOOD Food, just as many other reviewers have stated. What's even more shocking is the lack of effort in improving service as I do not see one response from management on yelp. I guess that's what you get with a chain restaurant.  [CUISINE] Drinks: I am completely obsessed with the mint limeade here. So so yummy!  Chicken Quesidilla: Not super cheesy. More meat than cheese. Very Yummy.  [DECOR]  I really like the decor if this fast food restaurant. They have hanging lanterns, colorful chairs and it feels like outside inside. Very Cute.  [SERVICE] They don't explain anything on the menu for instance they'll ask if you wanted your burrito enchilada style but not willing to explain what that means. Your just supposed to know apparently. Also they didn't mention guacamole is additional. Found out at the register it was $1.25 extra which was no problem but they should have mentioned it.   [PRICE] Cheap $7-$9 but the service was so bad it may be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"Yum! I love this place. The staff always works very quickly and accurately. The place is mostly clean, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"The food here gets five stars. The staff get five stars. The cleanliness of the dining area is always one star. The tables are always, and I mean always dirty. Not enough attention is given to the cleanliness or the dining area. It makes me wonder what goes on in the prep area. Too bad too,  because the food here is so good. Owner, please respond."}
{"text":"Rude employees who just stare at you when u ask questions. So loud I couldn't hear them. Line was very slow."}
{"text":"Went to this place a few times. Jario is a ROCKSTAR at working the line and getting everyone exactly what they want with out making us feel rushed! Management has great customer service skills and even if its crazy they cracks jokes to the customers waiting in line. Cashiers could smile a little more and be just a tad bit energetic while we pay for food but hey what do you expect from a fast casual place right.. Food is pretty tasteful considering the prices- Sweet Pork with Salmon in a burrito(Non Enchilada Style) is my pick."}
{"text":"Charge for sour cream or guac and even House green dressing. In Vegas dressing always free and choice of guacamole or sour cream free. This place nickels and dimes you. Just glad breathing is free....for now"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here without some issue. Love the food but never had worse service, first time ordered online, arrived at our pick up time, waited 45 min in line only to be told our food would be another hour. Next time, my husband tried to pick up dinner for all of us and after waiting in line he was told he would have to order through the app, or call in, they wouldnt take his order when he was physically in front of them. What?!?! Absolutely ridiculous way to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"So good! Friendly staff, wait time was long, very clean! I had Shredded Chicken Salad! It's was very good!"}
{"text":"I am totally a fan of Cafe Rio's food! However, I've noticed at every location I have visited, the customer service is lacking. For example, I just came in after my class at UNLV and only 2 gentlemen who were together were in front of me. There was maybe 2 tables full in the entire restaurant so it was not busy by any means. There was a huge catering order sitting on a couple tables, but there were plenty of employees around. Anyway, I walk right up to the ordering counter since the two guys were in the middle of their order and I overhear an employee tell them that they do not have pork. The employee maybe said sorry, but I honestly don't know. The two guys made a not funny joke about \"who's getting fired for this?\" because the pork is apparently all they come in for and it was obviously devastating for their dramatic selves. So, the employee just tries half-heartedly to make light of the situation and offers to give them the remaining pork and half of another meat. Now I have no idea what Cafe Rio's policy is on running out of items and what to do if that occurs, but if I was that customer I would be really bummed and would hope they would give me a free drink or like 10% off. Anything small just to make amends because I know I always go here for my shredded chicken salad and am not about to spend an extra $1 for grilled chicken if they were out of shredded. Fast forward to my order being completed with no hiccups. I am at the register and overheard from the employee who offered the half pork deal that the cashier was the manager. She was not what I expected a manager to be by any means. She wasn't rude or anything like that, but the customer service was not there even when I used a free meal card from my birthday! It seemed like she was just going through the motions and didn't care about me as the customer and a loyal customer at that. Ultimately, my order was perfect EXCEPT there was no cheese on my tortilla. I asked for it on the side which they did, but I never have to ask for cheese on my tortilla at other locations and this location didn't ask so I assumed it would be there. It's such a little thing, but it helps \"make my meal a masterpiece\" as they like to say so I was bummed when it wasn't there. I will totally return for the food despite my lack of cheese and customer service, but if customer service goes down any more than my standard, then the food isn't worth it. Also, where is the Southwest Limeade at this location?"}
{"text":"These guys used to have their act together. Great fresh food. It has gone downhill fast. The service is pathetic."}
{"text":"Here is my \"1 STAR REVIEW\" ! Similar to most below. Disrespectful manager almost as if he does not care he is driving people away and from a new business? Ruined food and unpleasant experience.      Bad reviews across the internet. Please post to the BBB and CONTACT CORPORATE so they will fix things. The alternative is a chronically bad restaurant or an abandoned location, just like happened to \"port of subs\" across the street - N/W McKellips & Power........"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different so we came here to Cafe Rio. I understand why there was a very long line!!! Excellent tortillas made fresh right in front of you and the service was phenomenal!!! Very, very good and fresh food. The only thing it lacked was clean tables and restroom. Otherwise, I'm coming back!!! I totally loved the food!!! Hopefully, this issue gets resolved soon, so I could share it with my friends."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio, always fresh and always delicious.  I do think the employees should be allowed to accept tips, especially at this location. Every time I visit this location I'm greeted with a friendly welcome and the staff actually talks to me while they make my food. The staff here is always tip top and I just wish I could tip them."}
{"text":"The steak salad from Cafe rio is one of the best things I've tasted in my life. I also love their new app rewards."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and the staff was friendly. I'm a vegetarian and usually when I order an all veggie meal I usually get a raised eyebrow. Here, no one questioned a thing."}
{"text":"OMG WHAT A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! I was taking a friend their for their first time and what am embarrassment we got their right before it opened and when they did i walked to the counter we ordered two bowls (they call them sides) and the fork had a shitty attitude then it came up to$19.04 with 2med drinks I'm like wth REALLY!!! So we move over to where you get your drinks and the syrup was out on EVERYTHING, so i told the rude cashier guy he came and looked and said ok and went back to his register I'm like WTH so i told another then they got one flavor to work so I just delt with that then we went outside to eat realize the tables and chairs were filthy so we go back inside every table and chair had food on it we're like damn they open up an establishment without cleaning it first so nasty! And the food was not impressive at all either it was just a bad experience overall I won't ever go back to that one again I'll stick to the one on Sunset I give that one a 10."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio! It's a local Las Vegas restaurant. I always take my friends and family from Cali to Cafe Rio because it's fresh and delicious! I tend to get the pork barbacoa salad. It's one of their specialties. There is a special everyday so just look outside the door since it's always posted. Everything here is great! Highly recommended to those who have never been. It's fresh, tasty and quality food!"}
{"text":"Been there twice, and it's been good both times. 4 stars only because I think their staff could be a little friendlier. Their portions are huge! If you're not a big eater, I suggest sharing :]  I had the quesadilla both times I've been there... first time I had the chicken, and the second time I had the pork barbacoa. Let me warn you now, its pretty oily! Grab some extra napkins to soak up the bottom of the plate and you should be good to go :p  I like that they have a good variety of drinks to choose from. Aside from the typical soda machine, they have a bunch of lemonades and teas, AND some bottles of different flavorings to add to your drink! i thought that was pretty cool :]"}
{"text":"If Chipotle weren't so concerned with projecting the illusion of health conscious fare, their food would be as delicious as Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Horrible service, slow lines, complacent employees...and when they run out of menu items the manager is completely unapologetic. The food is decent but it's certainly not worth waiting 30 minutes in line for to find out they don't have the special of the day. WTF?! Management needs to step up, there was absolutely no expediting of orders or organization. Did I mention not one of the employees can multi task?! No thanks, this city is too big for shitty service. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So its hard to mess up an order at Café Rio. You order what you want. You customize it how you want. You go through a line to make sure they are making it how you want it. The food itself is delicious. So whatever you get, you can't go wrong. The only thing is that the inside is a little messy. I think they're just crazy busy and the volume is so high, they don't have time to keep it tidy. The décor could use some work; it looks like a kid dumped some paint on the chairs and someone else picked up some decorations that they had stored in their closet, and that's it. But, food wise, its an A+!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my last two lunch experiences here. The food is great. Consistency is on spot here. The problem is the time it takes. They need more staff or more efficiency. For a \"fast serve\" restaurant it shouldn't ever take this long!!!"}
{"text":"Refused to accommodate a food allergy, which simply would have involved using rice without shitlantro in it.  Definitely will not waste my time coming here again, when Chipotle is just up the street, and is willing to accommodate an easy request."}
{"text":"They have very very delicious shrimp tacos go - taco tuesday! You really can't go wrong with any selection. They have really nice salad too !"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch at the Cafe Rio. What a great idea- you get a bunch of choices to order from- I got the taco plate with two tacos and chose the shredded chicken and the shrimp of the day with rice and beans. It's a little like a Chipotle but with allot more options. I wish the staff had drained the chicken a little more since sit was in so much water that it soaked through the tortilla. But overall, it was good and decently priced at $7. I was also impressed by the drink choices- they had lemonade with basil and three types of iced tea to try as well as an assortment of other delicious drinks all refillable and are all for the same price as a fountain drink.  The ambiance is kinda cute with multi colored chairs and tables.  If you're looking for a good priced and relaxed lunch, you can't go wrong with Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Cafe Rio fan and it is really hard for me to not like a location but here it seems like it's never what it should be. I've had rice not cooked, meat chewy, dirty tables, you name it. Other locations around town are much better. (Durango, Sahara or Blue Diamond)."}
{"text":"Always great food, great service! Love grilled chicken burritos! Always fresh and made with a smile. Inside is always clean, and a nice patio area outside, although not the best thing in Vegas summers, during spring or fall it's beautiful."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE Cafe Rio fan. I love the food. I've been to this location several times and haven't had any huuuge issues, the service is slow and the lettuce is always poorly chopped, but today on my lunch break my husband brought me a salad, and THERE WAS A BIG BUG IN IT. A decent sized beetle was laying dead mixed in with all my food.  I've never been so grossed out by food but this was it. So disappointed and frankly grossed out! Go to another location. :("}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try out this place because I'm a die hard chipotle fan... Sorry chipotle. I sorta cheated on you...  But I am very happy I did try out this place. The tortillas are made fresh right in front of you by a hard working lady. Oh goodness. Those tortillas were delicious. I'm on a diet and was just going to try a nibble, before I realized that dang tortilla was gone! Into my belly...  I got the grilled chicken salad with the creamy tomatillo sauce. Sooooo good! I liked the slight kick on the tomatillos sauce. It was very good!   When I got there, the line was three deep, but moved fairly quickly. The staff were patient with all the people who weren't familiar with their establishment. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but the service here is terrible. When I got there I asked the girl with a tooth missing to tell me all the meat options and she said them to me with attitude and after said \"that's why we have the menu.\" She was very rude. Then the girl at the cash register overcharged is $20! When we went to go get our money back, the girl with the missing tooth came to \"fix it\" but made it worse. She continued to have attitude so we asked to see the manager, the manager was rude and barely fixed the problem. We come here every Sunday and are loyal customers, but we will never come back after that terrible service. They were so rude I couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"Just like all the rest.  There was a time when Cafe Rio had it going on. We knew it, they knew it and things were really good.  The flavor is still there but things seem sloppy and the staff give off a \"don't give a shit\" attitude now.  I'm no restaurant chain consultant but I think if you pay managers enough to care and staff well enough that they know they're making a very competitive wage, value follows and customers come back.  Then again, customers might not care about anything other than consistency and this chain has found that sweet spot of product and price.  Guess that leaves the door wide open for someone else to do what they used to!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited 50 minutes in line for old coconut shrimp tacos. Rice n beans were good"}
{"text":"This is a place my family and I frequent, but I never think to write a review about. Although it sometimes feels like hit or miss, we keep coming back for that damn cilantro lime ranch and house made tortillas.  I recommend not doing online ordering here, as I feel like I never get the same amount of protein as I do when I order from the counter. Kind of frustrating.  The fire grilled chicken salad is a fav of both my husband and I. We have them drizzle a little bit of the red enchilada sauce on top for some added heat and to use less dressing. Btw, both the house and the vinegarette are outstanding. Like- I want to drink it or bathe in it. Maybe both.  I also can't forget to mention the queso and salsa Fresca here. So good. Unfortunately, the chips- not so much. Chipotles are way better.  Don't forget to ask for a punch card, every 10th meal is free."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I have ever had at a cafe rio! We walk in and aren't greeted by anyone and the place is a complete mess! The employees are just hanging around talking. We realize that there isn't very much of anything left, being that it was 8pm we figured they would be bringing out more, but NOPE. We asked the employee and she said they aren't making anymore food and suggest we go somewhere else. She then looked at my boyfriend and said \"she's too pretty to eat here just take her somewhere else\" the girls behind the counter were extremely rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Great place for pork barbacoa burrito and tacos.  Variety of boutique sauces to choose from.  Home made tortillas, beans and other veggies.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Tried cafe Rio for thenfirst time today, for as far as fast casual places go I would recommend trying this place . I had a burrito and a single taco just to try a couple different things. They even do enchilada style burritos which is a cool thing . I tried the beef in the taco and the meat was amazing very good and I regret not getting the beef in my burrito , I got the sweet pork barbacoa in my burrito and while the meat was good the flavor I feel like was best suited for another entre. The sweetness clashed just a bit . but I could imagine how good the beef would have been in an enchaldia style burrito . the queso sauce was very good and had a little kick to it.  The guac was my one complaint . just was not my favorite and I felt like it was a little pricey at 2 dollars a side. I will say I came in at night and they say they make their guac fesh daily so it may be better earlier on if its sitting out . . I would recommend trying this place for sure . it would not replace chipotle for me as my go tonfast casual Mexican place but it has different flavers and style that's a good change of pace . also very nice staff. And good drink options"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio, I am a huge fan of their pork burritos. However the sauce and the food was particularly bland at this location. Even the quest dip was disappointing"}
{"text":"Plenty of choices for burritos, tacos, salads, and more. Everything was real fresh. I don't get chicken often but their fire grilled chicken was worth it."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but it could be a whole lot better.   It was missing some heat.  If the food was spicier and the if the rice were more authentic I would be a fan."}
{"text":"Ordered nachos to go. First off, made the mistake of going in and ordering on Taco Tuesday. Never, ever again. It took 30+ minutes waiting in line. The way they heat up everything on the grill is horrendously inefficient in a large crowd.   Then, when it was my turn to order, the dudes taking orders were rude and didn't give me time to even specify how I wanted my nachos. When I asked for salsa, the guy rolled his eyes. When I got up to pay, the kid taking payments was not nice.   By the way, by the time I got home, my chips were so soggy that they were inedible. Had to use my own tortilla chips at home to scoop what I could off the top.   If I ever say I wanna eat here again, someone stop me."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time. Line moved pretty fast. Had the pork barbacoa tacos. Pork was tender, marinade on it was sweet that's why I like it better than chipotle. Place was clean, friendly service. Good price for lunch."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. All the associates are always talking when you go in. They snap at you and give you attitude constantly.  They don't give you eye contact and they act like they don't like their job. This is the only cafe rio I go to and I have this experience. The manager needs to retrain the staff or fire people. Ridiculous.. On top of that the food there is different all the time."}
{"text":"This place is pure garbage. It's an hour before they close and no rice. Secondly, seeing how dusty the apron of the girl making the burritos was unbearable. Next as they were making my burrito they messed up on an online order and smashed the burrito in the garbage. Not to mention chipotle donates or gives the food away or gives the customers food for free. Next when they asked if I wanted sauce on my burrito I thought that they would put 2 scoops on but boy was I wrong. The girl put 4 big scoops on my burrito making it greasier than a teenagers face.   In conclusion I would drive the extra mile and go to chipotle  An Update since the last time I went: the yelp rating has fallen from 3 to 2 stars and in my opinion it's still really bad"}
{"text":"I ordered my normal, chicken salad with rice and black beans. While mixing my salad around I noticed an extensive amount of liquid on the bottom of the salad tray. It made the salad extremely bland even after draining it off. Very disappointed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I used the online ordering which I absolutely love. I ordered my regular chicken salad with a side of queso and chips. I walked in and picked my food up without problem. When I got home and sat down to eat I realized I had a bag of chip crumbs. I had about 10 whole chips and the rest of the bag was filled with inch size pieces. This made enjoying my queso very difficult. Moving on the the salad. The salad itself was flavorful but the tortilla it sat on was no where near being cooked. I don't know if they make their own tortillas or not but mine was extremely doughy and tasted like oil. Not impressed at all. I was very disappointed with my meal and will think twice before coming to this location again."}
{"text":"While at work it is sometimes hard to find good, healthy food. Today I was able to run inside and get a salad in a fair amount of time. Let's be honest, any cafe rio at lunch time is a nightmare, but I was able to get in and get out quickly. I got to enjoy my favorite, chicken salad, which helped to make the rest of my work day bearable. I hope to be able to do this more frequently in the future. Nothing beats a good salad to keep you full for the day!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best quick Mexican around. I always order the chicken salad with the green dressing. Amazing!! They are always packed so I suggest to order online and pick up but if you don't it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Chicken enchilada and tacos were delicious! The place was very busy and didn't have the staff to empty the trash cans, nor keep the soda station tidy."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, I highly recommend the chicken tortilla soup. The key lime pie is an absolute must! If you leave this place without trying it, you are sincerely missing out. Only reason I'm getting them four stars is because the service wasn't the best"}
{"text":"Sitting outside waiting for my husband to order, all the tables are dirty and an employee is sitting at a table with feet up and says to me \"you can go inside and tell someone to clean it\". Are you that lazy? I have to do your job for you? I hope at least the food is as good as other cafe rio's but so far, this location is pretty dirty, and bad service. Also, the inside seating is very small and very crowded and it's way past the lunch rush.    After eating the sweet pork salad, which I've had enough times to know how good it is, I can say it was pretty bland at this location. They gave very little meat and were very stingy with the rice and beans. This location needs a new staff."}
{"text":"3rd time in, I think they are finally getting the hang of things. I love them. Basic, yes. But consistent food. Kids are fans now, too."}
{"text":"This location needs to work on cleanliness and prep. Scraping the barrel to get queso and didn't give me the full amount, out of chips-waiting for them while my queso gets cold. Customer service is poor. Girl didn't even apologize for being out of stuff. NOT HAPPY! Food area was dirty with lots of cross contamination. SAD."}
{"text":"I came here to get take out. I was pretty appalled by how rude the check out girl was. I gave her my card, she swiped it and handed it back. No have a nice day, anything else?, ect. I stood there a minute unsure if she needed me to sign a copy. She made me feel really unwelcome especially when she saw me not leaving she said \"do u need something\"? Such an awkward transaction."}
{"text":"Rice and beans not cooked....award winning Pork? Lmao. Soooo greasy. Mass confusion along the service line. Decor looks like a kindergarten classroom"}
{"text":"seeings that it is located in an area where there is nothing good around here. it's pretty decent. the order taking line is sooooo far ahead of the cashier line its comical. (not really) they need a separate to go line for sure!! the decor is like the rest (its a chain) resembling a kindergarten class room. food is good, a bit pricey, but ok.  it's really loud in there fair warning and turn up your hearing-aid and patience for the mass confusion in the ordering assembly line."}
{"text":"Im not a huge pork fan. But holy pig their sweet shredded pirk is amazing. I want the sauce...i need the sauce....like a gallon tub if it,to out in everything including my s/o (just kidding...maybe)"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio's steak & salmon. It's a go-to meal that my boyfriend & I order as just sides when we're too lazy to cook.  I go here often, but only because it's convenient to go to & my boyfriend craves it. The service always turns me off.  I used to order pick-up online, but every time I did my order was never ready & I had to wait. What's the point of ordering online? There were times I was overcharged, missing items & didn't get accurate proportions. I understand mistakes happen, but it happened often.  I order in-person now to avoid issues, but I still find myself correcting them.  Despite their service needing to be improved, their food is still good."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio but this location is not awesome...out of food (already cleaned up and put away), cleaning up a full 2 hours early... making us feel very uncomfortable to eat there"}
{"text":"Hopefully this is a one off. Visiting in Henderson and ready to enjoy a good meal.   First off the food was literally thrown into the plates not arranged carefully at all so the food looked like just a big pile of mess. OK they're trying to keep the line moving I figured that's fine I'll get over that.   Sitting down to eat there is a shrill phone ringing that just keeps going and going. It finally stopped much to my relief and then a minute later it started up again and continued for at least five more minutes. I went to the cashier and asked if they could answer the phone or turn it off and I got a blank stare. I'll let her know that it's not enjoyable or peaceful to eat with a shrill phone ringing through the restaurant the whole time.   I might try another Café Rio again but not this location. I don't see a lot of care or concern."}
{"text":"Tried it again, gave then some time before we went back. It is worse absolutely nothing has improved at this location.  Such a shame. We will continue to drive to the Stephanie location. I don't understand why corporate hasn't improved this location."}
{"text":"First time here and we'll return.    Fresh food, good prices and you can bring your dog and sit outside.  I loved the selection of meats and toppings.  My husband had 2 chicken tacos and I had a chicken enchilada.  All very tasty."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the fact that I love the Barbacoa so much I wouldn't waste my time here. The service is always average to poor. I usually swing by on my way home from work anywhere from 7-10pm and about 30-40% of the time they don't have something prepared or ready. I've been there when they've ran out of barbacoa, steak, queso and sauce. How do you run out of sauce? I get not cooking more meat based off the time/demand but not when you are open for another hour or two. I'm also the kind of person that doesn't go to places when they're only open for less than 30 minutes to try and avoid these issue.  Here are some guidelines: Come before 8:00pm If the line reaches the black stanchions just leave (guaranteed 20-30 min wait as they don't utilize the other register) unless you really want Barbacoa. That and the queso are the only superior items they have over other build your own burrito or mexican places.  Run out of meat: Go to Chipotle across the 215. Don't reward them for bad practices make a note to tell them nicely and leave.  I want to say a change of management would improve this place so much which is sad because I think they're relatively nice people.  Also, please greet the next person in line or the only person in line. Doing other duties while talking In Spanish to other coworkers doesn't bother me as long as I know that you've registered that I exist and am not just standing there for a minute. Seriously, something that simple and easy would go a long way."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great variety of meat options, the steak is especially good! My favorite dish is the enchiladas verdes full meal with lack beans. All the food is nice and fresh. Really recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Just came here yesterday for the first time ever. Hard to find a parking space at lunch time and crowded as hell inside. Got the last table.  Had a pork barbacoa burrito, \"enchilada style.\" The pork was a little too sweet, but the fresh home made tortilla was amazing and made up for it. Their fresh hot salsa required no additional Tapatillo. Huge selection of sodas and ice teas.   Sort of a Tex-mex flair, but pretty much \"sit down quality\" mexican food at a walk-up price. If these chains evolved from Rubio's to Baja Fresh to Chiplotle, there is now a new champion, and its name is Cafe Rio. Fortunately there's one somewhat close to me in Manhattan Beach, but everyone knows that you can't get there from RPV :("}
{"text":"I get frustrated when I come to cafe rio at 8:30 and they tell me they are out of horchata. I asked two different team member to refill and they insisted on telling me their pars were out for the night.  I call that lazy.  Also, the other craths were empty or nearly empty and the bathrooms had no paper towels. The store wasn't even busy. If you close at 11, your store should not look like this at 8:30-9:00.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but has since gone down hill. Quality is poor and meals are too expensive for what they are. 2 burritos was $20, not worth the money."}
{"text":"I use to visit this location 4+ time a month.  Today's experience was so bad that i will not be returning.  Breana was not a pleasant employee to work with.  I requested cheese and she advised there is already cheese on the tortilla.  Then proceeded to placed  lettuce on top of the meat and when get upset when i asked for the shredded lettuce, she removed the normal lettuce along with half of the meat.  I asked again for cheese and was advised there will be an extra charge, which was fine but i have never been told that before or charged. I do not get the dressing or other condiments and moved onto the register.  It is one thing to wait in line for a custom made meal but to have an employee give an attitude to a customers requests with other employees and customers watching is not an experience i want to go thru again."}
{"text":"Food and service are always good. Fresh tortillas, it doesn't get any better.   There is a reason its always busy..  Their carnitas are always a good bet."}
{"text":"Really???? I have been craving coconut shrimp taco Tuesday night....!  Get there at 8:30, and they ran out!???? What a bust!"}
{"text":"28 dollars for nachos and a tostada?!?! Oh and two drinks. I'm so dissatisfied with this place. They hardly put any chicken on either of our meals. They put guacamole on the nachos and I asked for guacamole on my tostada and they gave me a side and charged 2 bucks for it. Not impressed. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and the food is awesome and the best staff ever.  They are all friendly, fast and they go above and beyond.  So much better than Q'Doba that was here before!  Welcome to the neighborhood Cafe Rio!!"}
{"text":"You guys are infuriating.   How is it possible that EVERY TIME we order pickup you forget condiments or entrees?!  I'm not kidding,  EVERY TIME.  We order our food,  pay for our food, come home only to discovery we have to go back again.   How do you value your customers so little that you can't take the time to check the order before sending your customer home with it especially after so many complaints?!   Can you not come to the logical solution to put a check system in place?"}
{"text":"Really good food, but they had 2 different menus. . I happened to look at the one on the wall that is closest to where you ordered. . I ordered 2 taco meal that says 7.99 with your choice of meat.  I chose carne asada with no extras like sour cream and guac .. I ordered a drink and my bill came out to 12.63.. a drink cost 2.19 how did it come out to that much. . I asked the cashier and she said they changed the prices on their other menu that I didn't even see.  They refused to refund or help the situation. . They need to change both menus because they are just confusing people"}
{"text":"YUM!!! From the outside, it looks like its a restaurant with waiter service from all the outdoor seating. My first time here I discovered that it was actually an order and sit down! I really enjoyed eating here. First of all, the sweet pork was SO delicious!! Flavorful, tender, and flat out delicious. I really like how when ordering, you watch everything that they put on or into whatever you are eating. When we ordered our nachos, they slapped on a ton of cheese and put it through the  toaster which I loved. some places give it to you where some of it still has cold cheese on it! I would totally come back to try the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good food and a fun atmosphere. A great variety of Mexican food on the menu. You will not regret going there."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Staff was very unfriendly and seemed  like they didn't want to be bothered. Won't go there again or possibly any Cafe Rio again!"}
{"text":"Worse service from any cafe rio in southwest Vegas.  People behind the counter are not paying attention. Two were talking about how their register was short.  Others were just starring at customers and not providing any help to the increasingly growing line.  Lady at the cash register was touching customers food with no gloves and to make it worse she was handling cash before hand. All in all I wouldn't even give this location a store one star but there's no option for that on yelp. If you're in the Southwest area of Vegas, skip this location and drive the extra distance to the one on 215 and Durango."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio makes the best burritos around here. I went for lunch yesterday with my family and the burritos were filled with meat and lots of lettuce and tomatoes. I highly recommend this place for family eating!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and was supposed to be ready at 5:45pm. They didn't start making my order until I arrived. Why have order online if you don't fulfill the orders?? Usually they are pretty good. I've been here several times and almost always order online. Once they screwed up my order and now this. I'm really disappointed with the quality of service. And of course I ordered my burrito enchilada style and it wasn't made that way so I had to go back in. Always check your order before leaving. At least the food is yummy when they get the order right. My suggestion always just order your food when you're there."}
{"text":"They are not open until 11pm on Friday. Wasted my time when I could've made it to another location that was actually open at 11pm. Thanks for false advertisement!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. This is a \"Chipotle\" style resturaunt. You can pick a burrito, salad, tostada, tacos, or quesadilla. Then you pick the rice and beans you want, ( black or pinto,cilantro rice or ?). They had shredded chicken, sweet barbacoa, steak, and a couple other choices, cheese, 4 salsas, quacamole , sour cream and fresh rolled out homemade tortillas! The dough was actually being rolled out by hand one at a time. After they were rolled out, the tortillas are put on a rotating round grill. The taste can not be beat!The food was amazing here. Now comes the bad, the workers seemed short with customers and seemed annoyed at questions. I would have gave it a 5 star had the staff had a better attitude. Whoever hires the staff needs to teach them they serve, that's what they are paid for. If they don't like working at Cafe Rio, go somewhere else. A bad attitude can drag a business down fast. ***************UPDATE************************* I went to eat here today and had the most pleasant experience. I was served with superior service, fast and freindly. Thank you for the change. The food is awesome and service customer service was awesome as well.I needed to give this place at least 1 more chance and I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Great salad with sweet pork. You need to ask for more pork to make the salad tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my husband while he was on his lunch break and once after we left the nearby water park.   I love the flavors of everything I've ever eaten here. What I don't care for is how long it takes to get through the line.   Yeah, I know. Who on earth actually wants to wait in a line. Suck it up buttercup! Right?!  Long line aside, I do like their food. I have yet to come on the day they serve their tamales! Darn it. Because I heard they are one of their best items.   Their queso is very good and I love their salsa.   Portions are huge! I usually eat half and take the rest home for another meal."}
{"text":"Love eating here. The tortillas are nice and fresh.  The food is filling and super fresh.  The service is fast and friendly. I like the app. And the fact I can earn points when I get my food.  My husband and I love having a date night we choose to eat there."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the salad with house dressing and fire-grilled chicken. The staff could use a little \"happy employee\" training but otherwise great place."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin... Food was cold, service was terrible, forgot items I ordered... Called to complain and the lady who answered the phone had this like \"whatever\" attitude... She did offer me a free meal and the chips if I wanted to go back in tonight... I told her I can't... So she took my name and phone number... Which I probably won't be going back to redeem..."}
{"text":"Just picked up food from here about 9:00.  First of all I ordered a barbacoa burrito and chips and queso. Went to pay he told me one price then switched it on me after he told me. Also thanks for serving me burnt queso dip. This is the worst cafe rio in town by far. Very inconsistent food and service the last few times I have been has been below par. Also your supposed to serve the same food an hour before you close that you do during the middle of the day. Don't give customers scraps because they come in late!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday on the recommendation of a girlfriend.  She says she swears by the place, and you really get a good amount of tasty food for your money.    The place was really colorfully decorated.  Vibrant colors, and lots of seating.  They have a fairly simple menu, but with a variety of choices.   I went with the enchilada with steak.  I think all the tortillas are made here in house? You can get different style beans, and the selection was reasonably ample.    I liked the food here, but its not the greatest food Ive had.   Part of it I think was the fact that you order in a line, and sometimes I had a hard time hearing what the guy was asking me.   I am going to go back soon and hopefully try something spicier.  I ordered my food a little on the bland side.  Why?  as of lately either my food is way to bland and boring or its so spicy that I cant finish it.  I will be back, thats for sure!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good food. Remarkably bad service.  No on can deny that the food is anything short of amazing at Cafe Rio. You can see the tortillas being hand made, tomatoes being crushed, and chicken right on the grill. The food is fresh and delicious.  However, you'll likely miss the visuals of the high quality food as you stare, baffled, at the inefficiency of the employees. Lacking any kind of leadership during any time of day, the staff grouchily fumbles through their tasks at snail-like speed, often making mistakes and never coming anywhere close to a smile. Organization is a word that doesn't exist behind the cooking line or in the sticky, dysfunctional dining room. The drink station offers great limeade and on-point horchata, if you can pull the soles of your shoes out of the syrupy, sticky floor surrounding it.  Don't even think of coming around dinner time unless your definition of a good time includes standing in line for an hour and listening to fellow patrons openly complain about the speed of service.  Maybe at some point my lunch and dinner funds will afford the staff a field trip to a Chipotle to learn how to work in an efficient, clean establishment."}
{"text":"Frustrated. Ordered veggie burrito-sucked up the $9 cause it comes with the guacamole. Then told guac was extra. Me: \"No it's not--your menu says it's included in veggie. \" cashier: \"oh.\" Checked my receipt and I got charged for dressing with my tostada. I asked her why. Cashier: \"Because you got 4oz size.\"  Me: \"so I just said 'yes, house dressing.' I never ordered extra. So your team put it in a larger container and I just have to pay?\" I know it's pennies but made me feel like I was being swindled. Makes it hard to enjoy my dinner."}
{"text":"The best two things are the fresh tortillas, and the mint limeade!  Tastes like a virgin mojito -- so good!  My friend told me Cafe Rio is better than the other Mexican QSR's I frequent (Chipotle, Zabbas, Baja Fresh, etc) and I was hesitant ... but he was totally right.  The steak salad with everything is wicked filling, and instead of a fried shell, they serve it in a nice, toasty fresh tortilla.  I've been back once a week since trying this fantastic place!  The line at dinner time is really long, but it moves quick.  The UNLV location has a little bigger servings, but I like the atmosphere on Eastern better.  Cheap for a meal and half -- my steak salad and a large soda ends up $11.07"}
{"text":"I've been to this locations dozens of times. Haven't been back in months because of the slow and horrific service provided every single time. And now I hate myself again.  I showed up with only 2 people ahead of me. Trash can overflowing, dirty tables everywhere and trash in the ground.  I'm not expecting Four Seasons treatment at a fast casual place, but can I get a hello and a smile? My god. They just stare and give nods instead of questions, put the wrong stuff on my order, despite very clear directions.  Then in the middle of order, there was some kind of molasses speed shift change. They had 20+ workers standing around chatting. Now a line of ten people forms behind me and I haven't moved. The new guy grabs my salad and starts loading it up with everything without asking. I had to start over. The workers are bumping each other, touching  everything, and joking around.   Finally they try to get me to pay for someone else's meal, then try to over charge me. Just the worst.  I'd like to say I'll never be back. But in a few months I'll forget and be a glutton again.   This place is the worst. Do not come here. Give your money to someone else until they fix their management problem which has been ongoing for years."}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good, and definitely fresh. As a first timer I wasn't sure what to expect but I was satisfied with the quality of the food. The only problems were being rushed. I'd say there were 5 people in front of us. I dont coinsider that a lot, but the way they rushed us through the line, I guess the employees do. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Delicious but since I was rushed and didnt understand how they organize the line I didnt get all the toppings I wanted. And the enchiladas were served in a foil tray with beans and rice. When I asked for black beans, I didnt realize they weren't going to strain the juice, so I eneded up with kind of a soupy mess that made the enchiladas soggy. But the chicken was really good and the veggies very fresh. I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Staff here was truly amazing!! We ordered for our staff meeting for about 16 people. I got here literally 10 minutes after I ordered and they said they would have it right up. Shortly after I was walking out with my food in hand. Great service and food was all prepared perfect. We will be back soon enough"}
{"text":"Anytime I am in a town lucky enough to have a Cafe Rio I make sure I get at least one meal there. Their mild sauce is so good. The only downside is that the lines are usually long. But I guess that means everyone else likes it too!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio, please find me a place in Mexico that has sweet barbacoa. Go ahead, I'll wait...oh wait, you can't find it because it doesn't freakin exist. So why the hell is YOUR barbacoa sweet?! The food is garbage, the service is garbage, cafe rio is garbage. Just go dumpster diving instead of eating here.   Yuck. There is nothing else to say."}
{"text":"Looooove this location  Is probably the cleanest, nicest and best quality food, extremely recommend"}
{"text":"Food is good but it was so busy (taco Tuesday) it was like a cattle call and service is not as accurate as on other days. Had to explain to the person behind the counter 3 times that we wanted grilled chicken, not shredded chicken. Once you get to the front of the line, everything happens so fast, that it is easy to get your order incorrect, especially when they put your meal in the oven and will sometimes give you someone else's food. Other complaint is that you get nickel and dimed for every little thing. For example, cheese inside your burrito is included in the cost of the burrito, but get the cheese on the outside and there is a charge. The $2 charge for guacamole is per scoop, not per meal...3 tacos with guacamole, is $6 just in guacamole plus the cost of the taco itself. Tip: The biz model, menu and food is almost identical to that of Costa Vida. Since both are only about a mile apart from each other, if one is super busy, we'll take our chance going to their competitor."}
{"text":"I enjoy the quality of food. It is always consistant and they have friendly people taking your order. Beware of Sat and Sun afternoons. And lunch hours. They have an insane line and it would better suit you to wait in your car, call and order take-out, and then walk in 10 minutes later to purchase and avoid the line. My fave is the sweet pork burrito. Always a winner."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Cafe Rio food. Love, love, love. However, the customer service at this location is HORRENDOUS. Like really, really bad. I placed an online order for 6:15, arrived almost exactly then, and still had to wait for a long time. 36 minutes, to be exact. I wasn't the only one. There was another set of people who'd already paid for their online orders who were waiting a similar amount of time, if not longer. One women's waited for 45 minutes, went up to say something, and then was told that they didn't even have her order. So they had to make it right then. This is unacceptable.   I don't know if it's because they're new, if it was because it was dinner hour, or what, but something needs to change. We won't be going back to this location until things pick up and will be telling ALL our friends to avoid it as well. Really, really disappointing."}
{"text":"The service and management at this location has really gone downhill in the past couple of years. Yesterday, we spent 25 min in line (not a long line), then all of the iced tea canisters were out, so I had to go back to let someone know. Food was good. When we left, I went back to get some iced tea that should be ready, but then there was no ice and the tea was too dilute. So much for the drink I paid for. There was a large puddle of standing water in front of the ice machine with no warning sign and nobody attending to it (potential lawsuit right there if someone got hurt). The garbage was overflowing, literally.  This has always been a great restaurant with its convenient location and large seating area, but the work ethic of the workers is what brings it down. There are a few hard workers, so I don't want to put them down, but the overall feel is of sluggish employees that DON'T CARE. People move at a snail's pace and seem completely oblivious to the aggravation that one feels by the time you actually get to the clueless cashier who doesn't care either."}
{"text":"I like cafe rio but it's definitely not my favorite. I do love the fresh tortillas but that's it. It's more on the pricier side compared to chipotle and zabas which is a block away. I had a barbocoa quesadilla it was alright. I don't hate this place but I don't love it either very mediocre in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have come to this location a number of times and each time it seems that the food and service have gone downhill.  Today's visit (about 4:45pm) there was an issue with a customer and an employee. The customer insisted your employee made a remark about her in Spanish and was offended.  I have no idea what was said, but I heard this woman speak about it for nearly 10 mins waiting for my phone in order.  In that time I was able to observe the environment.  Your store was beyond dirty, even filthy is a kind word to describe it.  If she hadn't already rung my card I would have just left.  There also never seems to be anyone over the age of 16 working, and no manager that I could find.  After finally receiving my food and getting home, I was yet again disappointed. Pork in my salad was barely above room temperature.  An odd taste I couldn't pinpoint, and numerous romaine cores to pick around.  The chips for my queso were cold and soggy.  I received a side of salsa fresca instead of jalapeños.  Due to the odd flavor of the salad I didn't dare eat more than a few bites.  You've made me feel like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Where are the adults in this establishment? Food everywhere, shameful! Not sure if I can even eat what I am taking home because of how disgusted I am."}
{"text":"This had got to be one of my favorite places to go . I love the barbacoa quesadilla !  I get it every time . The staff is so polite and willing to answer any questions you may have . The store is kept clean even during rush time . I also have to mention their horchata is the best I've ever had in my life ! Also they have a stamp card system that after 10 you get a free meal . Overall this place rocks and I'll keep coming here forever !"}
{"text":"I just wanted to update my review.  This location seems much better organized now.  I think they just needed time to get their act together.  We go there once a week and enjoy the food very much.   I wish that I could give 3 1/2 stars because I do feel that this location is improving.  I think they are losing a lot of business because of the bad reviews and slow service.  That works out fine for me because now I don't have to wait in line as long :)  We always order the special of the day, so the price isn't quite so high.  The place isn't cheap, but they do give you a lot of food for your money.  They didn't have horchatta (sp?) two times and that really pissed me off because I'm addicted to the stuff.  They said the morning crew forgot to make it.  Is that seriously an excuse?  I have never received cold food there, and I think the food tastes the same as every other location.  I don't think I have ever seen the place dirty, either.  The workers have always been polite to us, so we can't complain about that.   I live very close to this location, so I will continue to go there.  I might just have been lucky, but we do go there a lot, so maybe the people who had had bad experiences should give them one more chance."}
{"text":"I had the special today the tamales.  They were very tasty and fresh.  The rice and beans were very tasty.  It's very refreshing to see homemade tortillas right there. The staff was nice and helpful. I will be back can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Cafe Rio.  Hands down best casual mexican food in the southwest.  I love that kids under 6 get free quesadillas.  All tortillas made fresh and they have so many options.  I love their tortilla soup, made fresh so you can choose your ingredients.  I have always had great customer service there, the only complaint is sometimes the lines are crazy, but how can you fault a business for being successful.  I go there a couple times a month, and the fact they have a loyalty punch card is even better!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad at all. It's fairly new in the neighborhood and actually checked it out by accident considering the restaurant I wanted to go to around the corner was way overpriced. I'm glad I stopped by to check it out! The menu was fairly reasonable, and yea, it did remind me of Chipotle, except, I think this place has larger burritos than Chipotle! The staff was friendly, and fast. They put our burritos in this oven conveyor belt that thoroughly melted the cheese and baked our burritos. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Worst cafe rio I've ever been to. Consistently out of something. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that they've had everything I've asked for. The food quality is good with the missing ingredients aside.   The customer service is also atrocious. The first time I got attitude I wrote it off as the girl having a bad day, but it's consistently that way.  If there was another one close to my house I would never go to this cafe rio."}
{"text":"Another great meal here. Employees were all friendly and helpful. Got my favorite Chicken burrito with fresca sauce inside. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Also don't forget to try the Blood Orange Lemonade. It's a seasonal drink and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio used to be right near my work at 48th and Ray, but they moved to Gilbert so I am pretty bummed.  The salads are amazing, and you should DEFINITELY give one a try. They take a fresh homemade tortilla and warm it up, then layer it with veggie friendly beans, fresh lettuce, cheese, etc etc... and it is topped with THE most AMAZING cilantro dressing.   I honestly crave this dressing and really wish that I could find a good bottle of it somewhere.  I cannot attest to the decor or service because I have not visited the area, but I would definitely grab that salad if I were ever in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here three times.   One day the special was chile relleno.   Another day I ordered the enchiladas,  and today I ordered the enchiladas.   The first 2 visits everything was good.   Today,  the food temperatures were off.  The black beans were hot and one of the sauces as well.  They send the tray through to melt the cheese thank goodness.   The meat was not as hot as  it should have been.  The rice had dried up pieces among it and the coconut  flan was visually unappealing.  The texture was odd as well.  The machines for horchata and all other drinks next to it was off and practically empty.   Customer service was okay.  The first lady did well, but the guys seemed more interested in their personal conversation.   The tables were in need of cleaning.   I ate very little and  threw the rest away.  My experience today will not have me coming back  to eat here for a while."}
{"text":"I go every Saturday. My daughter and I LOVE this food. Great service here too. Their sauces are the best."}
{"text":"Wow- not a very hard job to do, but somehow they are successful at screwing up my order every time- Tonight was the final straw-  Thanks for not paying any attention whatsoever and giving my order to the person I front of me without even asking what he had gotten- Then on top of that, prior to my order being given away- we waited like 5 minutes while the shrimp and fish were both on the grill being cooked/heated up, but when the kid whom had ZERO attention to detail had to remake my order it only took 30 seconds............ So yay for ice cold fish and shrimp tacos!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very VERY VERY busy location. Call ahead, it will save you at least a 30 minute wait as I learned the hard way.  The food, as always, is freakin yum!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location in Las Vegas. I literally called my order in (enchilada burrito and guacamole) 15 minutes before I arrived. When I got there I had to pay immediately and literally stood there for an additional 15 minutes while I watched 10 other people get their food. When the takeout girl finally asked about my order it had been laying there already for God knows how long. No apology.. the service is horrible and the whole restaurant is disorganized. Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I really think you TRY to be this bad.  And you try HARD.  I ordered online.  I selected \"substitute shredded lettuce.\"  When you charge NINE DOLLARS for a veggie salad, one would think that you could get the lettuce right.  Instead I get pieces of lettuce the size of my HAND that are damaged (bruised) and clearly still dirty and / or wilted.  The rice was cold, the tortilla was never heated.  Maybe you are not familiar with the components of your salad.  P.S.  An entire BAG of tortilla chips cannot hide the fact that your salad is comprised of things I would put in the disposal rather than consume.  I have *no* idea why I went back to this location.  You are an embarrassment to Cafe Rio.  I hope they shut down your franchise."}
{"text":"Delicious made ot order Mexican food.  I really love the fire grilled chicken and steak, both the salad and burritos are my fav's.  Fresh hand made tortillas and free kids quesadillas to boot.  Easy mode for a quick and health meal."}
{"text":"I like cafe rio but don't like this location.  The bathroom was nasty! The customer service was awful and the food was bland.  No need to go into a lengthy story of my experience but I just felt the need to warn you."}
{"text":"Over priced el polo loco ..only thing that's pretty decent about this chain is the home made , fresh tortillas otherwise I really don't understand the big boner , hype about this place ! Please !! Eat some real Mexican food ppl you wouldn't even know what good , authentic Mexican food is in this town"}
{"text":"I was hesitant of visiting this establishment because the reviews were so negative. My experience though, was pretty good and the food was good for the price.   When you order food (tostada, burrito, tacos, etc) they pretty much put on it anything you want. I ordered the tostada and it ended up being like a salad with a tostada at the bottom. I didn't mind this because the pork I chose was pretty tasty. The price for a meal and drink came out to about $8.50 which I think is good for the amount of food received.  I did though, feel rushed when I was ordering and the server assumed I wanted everything in my tostada. I had to intervene because I wanted a more simpler dish. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is not the spot. The food though, has good flavors and it is well seasoned.   I would come back here for lunch. It is close to work and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"The food from the moment we walked in did not look to good, but after working for 13 hours I just needed to eat. I ordered the sweet pork barb burrito. The rice looked kinda yellow with green splotchs of i guess a vegtable. They were out of black beans and they brought out more cut the bag of beans open and poured them in the heating trays, very classy. He scooped a little rice, the a heaping portion of the bagged beans, on top, Then a descent sized portion of meat, the only good thing I will say about my experience there. Then the order taker kept insisting I get the sauce on my burrito I dont like sauce a lot, on or in, my burrito but after three attempts to say no sauce, I gave in and aaid a little on the inside, I got A LITTLE  on the inside and hit me a dollar for my dab of sauce. Now I feel like a sucker. The yellow rice was under cooked, the beans were to many. The order taker made a sloppy wet burrito and backdoored a dollar. The kitchen floor needed to be cleaned. Even the cute girl at the register was rude and to distracted to take the money out of my hand. My first experience will be my last"}
{"text":"Overpriced for small plate.. since I came for the first time it's been less and less food in your plate.. I got stake enchiladas and basically was tortilla with cheese..  for 10 bucks.. what a deal!!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio and this particular restaurant is a lot closer to my house than the Eastern one.  It is also quite a bit bigger with a lot more room for parking.  And it's right next to Total Wine so you can get some delicious Mexican food while you are shopping for booze.  The service at this Rio was fast and friendly.  From time the of ordering to paying, I think it was about 3 minutes.  Everyone on the line was very nice and said hello.  I like good service, even at a fast food type of joint.    The food was great just like at other Rios and it really hit the spot.  The tortillas at these places are just plain delicious!  I've already raved about the Sweet Pork Barbacoa and if you haven't tried it, you must!  The chips and guacamole were delicious as well and there was a ton of them.  Great deal for the price.  This is a nice in between restaurant if you don't feel like Taco Bell but don't really want to go to a sit down place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My wife had brought home a leftover salad from here before and both the tortilla and dressing were so delicious.  I decided I needed the full experience so we went here the other day.    Let me tell you this:  the Sweet Pork Barbacoa was one of the greatest meats I've ever had at any type of Mexican joint.  So tender, sweet, and flavorful.  Again, those tortillas are like a little piece of heaven.  The ordering process is fast, simple and they have a great selection of drinks to choose from.  I love me some Chipotle but I think I found my new go to for somewhat healthy fast food.  There's really not much more to say except I need to go back this week to try something else.  My wife's enchiladas were great as well so that might be my next choice."}
{"text":"It's usually pretty busy, but it's always really tasty. Even with a longer line, they still usually crank people through pretty quickly. The meat is delicious. My son loves their quesidillas. Their salad can be made to be Slow Carb friendly, which is great to know (it's hard to find Slow Carb friendly fast food places)."}
{"text":"I love love love these steak tacos! And the mint limeade is out of this world good. We eat here a few times a month and have always been greeted by friendly staff and even if the line is long, it moves fast."}
{"text":"Although food is good customer service is terrible they always ask what you have they constantly mess up orders they don't listen and they play around too much. Been here over 12 times because it's the closest to my house but man i will be going to the centennial one because they actually pay attention to the order and the customer."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Cafe Rio but not this location! It has gone downhill for the last few years now. I use to go here all the time in high school with friends and always had a great experience but not lately. The environment isn't the cleanest anymore and the service is not the best. Would totally recommend Cafe Rio just not this location."}
{"text":"Today Wednesday Cafe Rio had the Grilled chicken tostada on special. You get a drink with the meal for $7.69 plus tax. I upgraded the drink to a large and the total was $9.67.   The grilled chicken tostada was really good. I like the fact that you're able to customize it to your needs, specially if you're eating healthy and you're watching your intake.  The ingredients in it were all fresh for example, the tomatoes,lettuce, and cilantro were crisp and tasted fresh and had crunch. It was a very good meal.   This location is on Decatur. The one tip I do want to give everyone is do not go during lunchtime hours Monday through Friday, I was there at 12:05 and it was super packed that's generally a good sign of the food but bad if you have time restraints.  overall a good meal, at a good price."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. But I tried to call in an order, when I was on my way home, and was told it would be 30 minute wait. I would understand that if I was ordering at 5 PM. This was 3 o'clock in the afternoon and I was ordering one order of nachos. Instead  I skipped the order and did not get anything from Café Rio. What a bummer"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Busy as can be when we walked in but definitely part of the dying rush... service was awful. Don't give me the option of what I want and don't want on my item if you're not going to listen. Was very rushed and the table was out of everything. Replenishment wasn't happening. Very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Pork Barbacoa salad, my hands down favorite with burrito a close second. Only down side is the acoustics, it's a loud place especially with all the screaming kids."}
{"text":"Worst ever.   Tried to give it a chance multiple times but this location is just terrible.   Everytime I have gone in no matter what time of day there is never any meat prepped or cut up ready to serve.   It's always give us ten minutes or have something else that's cooked.  So sad since it's close to my home but I will never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to this location often(baseline).We love Cafe Rio, the food is delicious. However as of late, the staff always seems to be in a shit mood and is very rude. Every time we ask for extra sour cream the employees acts as if we are cutting their paycheck in half. We know sour cream costs extra. Cafe Rio please hire people that want to work and not people that act like doing their job is such an inconvenience."}
{"text":"What in the hell happened here? I walk in to place a to go order for my mom and it went to shit pretty much after that. The guy working the grill is shoving food down his throat.. Gross! The employees looked dumbfounded, the food area was a complete disaster. The girl in the front puts the plastic lid on the food.. But she didnt do it properly so beans and rice are swimming at the bottom of the bag. Just ridiculous, the food was well over $13 and it didnt look fresh. Not going back"}
{"text":"Love the food, but this location has terrible customer service. Back in April my boyfriend and I were standing next to the counter there to pay, and the lady working the cash register didn't even look at us, skipped to ring up the lady who was behind us in line. We stood there until she started to ring up the next person, and I said something about her skipping us.  Tonight we went back in around 10 pm, an hour before closing, and all the workers were cleaning, which is understandable, I've worked in fast food service before. A particular teenage boy was cleaning around the food, and looked up at us, didn't say anything, but continued to keep cleaning. We stood there for 5-7 minutes before someone peeked out from behind a door and told him to help us. He stopped cleaning and went to wash his hands, and cracked a joke about them being closed already. Which made us feel very uncomfortable, and unwelcome, so we left without ordering. It was very rude and unprofessional. It's a shame because I used to eat Cafe Rio quite a few times a month when I lived near a different location, and this location is the closest to my house. I don't think we'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Rio on Taco Tuesday.  One taco for $2, and for another $2 you can add beans, rice and a soft drink.  I thought this would be a great deal.  This was the strangest taco I've ever had.  It was greasy, but yet it wasn't fried.  Not sure how they accomplished that, but for that reason, I won't be returning.  Food was bland, at best.    Like another Yelper mentioned, the height of the dividing wall between the food prep and customer area so high I had to stand on my tippy toes to shout my order to her.  I asked for retried beans three times, but nope, I got regular pinto beans.  They were still better than the taco!"}
{"text":"Their Owner's Favorite pork barbacoa burrito is seriously the BEST burrito I've ever had.  And the fact that I was able to take my two children to lunch there for less than $10 was amazing.  Lively lunch atmosphere, kid-friendly, and excellent food!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I don't think there will ever be a better Mexican \"fast-food\" joint anywhere. I love everything about this place from the flesh tortillas, to the crazy good pork salad, to the super tart lime pie. I have eaten myself sick here so many times I can't count them. If you are looking for a great quick bite this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Gave cafe rio another try and I am disappointed once again. The guy who was building my taco was so selfish with the toppings. Even when I asked for more he seemed annoyed about it and yet my tacos came out half ass. Over priced for what I ended up with. Bad customer service and not worth the price. Also, I ended up home realizing they forgot to add my beans and rice!"}
{"text":"Don't think I'd ever come back, pretty overpriced for fast food Mexican place. Every single thing you want is extra charge! For sauce, cheese, etc are all extra charge. Not worth the price, might as well go to chipotle and get extra of everything. Staff weren't the nicest either"}
{"text":"Joke of a guacamole. I ordered the steak quesadilla which is supposed to come with guacamole. They use 2oz soufflé cups to dispense it. They barely filled it up 1/4 of the way. Stop being so cheap!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was amazing!!! The manager was so nice and friendly. Whole restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Service is abysmal, most of the staff is blatantly rude. Food is decent, and the price is great on taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"First of all, this is NOT authentic Mexican food. If you enjoy Americanized Mex, this is the place for you. Taco Bell is more Mexican than this place. Too expensive and not even tasty. Their version of \"hot\" sauce cracks me up. Too sweet, it's so gross. I'll go make my own food than taste this Americanized crap ever again. It only gets one star from me because the people are nice, I guess."}
{"text":"Ordered food for take out, and I was told that it would be ready in 25 min. When arriving at Cafe Rio the food wasn't ready its been about an additional 15 mins on top of the original wait time , and the food is still not ready. Not only is this the first time this happened, but the second time. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, not if you are expecting to just grab your food and go when ordering take out. Expect to wait for a long time. Also the manager has a really bad attitude."}
{"text":"They had the worst customer service ever. We couldn't hear them a few times and asked them questions and answered us back in the rudest way possible and even rolled their eyes at us. The lady at the cashier was nice, but everyone else seriously needs to take classes on manners and customer service. I don't even care how the food is, if your service SUCKS, I will never come back. Will be letting the manager know as well."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION! waited in line for my online pick up for 30 minutes past the pick up time. When I asked to speak to the Manager, the manager told the employee quote \" I do not have time for her, she will have to wait!\". when I approached her up at the counter she was rude and aggressive. I explained the situation and she continued by yelling at  me that she would not stop the line to help me! Even though I had already waited nearly 40 minutes for my burrito! When I commented back she told me to leave the store because she would not deal with me. So after waiting 40 minutes I left the store with no meal! I am absolutely disgusted with her behavior! And to think that Cafe Rio Hires manager with such lack of customer service and common sense. The manager CAROLE is an awful  representation of the company!"}
{"text":"Looong line...but only waited 15 minutes. All food items were fresh and very tasty. Fire roasted chicken was excellent. Staff was friendly and all working hard. Nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"This location has the most unpleasant staff that I've ever encountered in the food industry. Everyone looks miserable. There's no sense of urgency and no customer service whatsoever."}
{"text":"The food is good and the kitchen is clean but this is a CHEAP ASS Cafe Rio. I usually pay for a side of house dressing and get the large cup. At this location you get the same charge but get a 2 oz cup. I went up to tell them I accidentally got a small cup and they said the large cup costs more. I had to break a $5 just to pay the extra .54 cents. But that's not it: getting an extra tortilla is pretty normal right? Not here. I was told the tortillas only come in 2's, so I'd be paying for 2. Every other Cafe Rio give (and charges) for 1 extra tortilla but this one forces the higher sale of 2 extra tortillas. Think of the stingiest Panda Express you've ever been to, that's this Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no reason to call in your order here. They don't start making your order until you show up and pay. Might as well come stand in line. \"Phone order pick-up\" counter is worthless."}
{"text":"Praying I don't get food poisoning after this... I was SO excited for a cafe rio here. Unfortunately, total bust. Terrible, slow service. Got home and stared eating, the noticed something chewy. I pulled a piece of Saran Wrap out of my mouth. A wadded up piece. Yes. Saran Wrap. And no, my salad wasn't wrapped with Saran Wrap. Disgusting. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I ALWAYS come here and have had great service but today it was terrible! People were standing around texting, I wasn't acknowledged or greeted. Finally the rude person asked what I wanted and I started  my order. My shell for my salad was hard which was disappointing and when I asked about it, I got no response. Who Re these folks that work on the weekend? Real douche bags! Get it together!"}
{"text":"Super excited about having a Cafe Rio real close to home, so my family and I finally went on 2/7/16, 45 mins prior to closing time. They were out of grilled chicken and the restaurant was a bit messy. The staff was nice. There was a funny young Latino male who made my son laugh, so the staff is funny and friendly. We all ended up getting a steak burrito, enchilada style, with the lettuce and pico. Note to self, get the salad and pico on the side next time because it made our burritos soggy. Overall, the food was delicious! We shall return to Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, fair prices make this fast food burrito bar a winner in my book.  When you walk up to the counter you can watch them making fresh tortillas.  They don't use microwaves or freezers.  Lots of tedious, hand preparation goes on here with large bins of fresh avocados, tomatoes and limes visible to the customer.  I'm not sure where how they came up with the name Cafe Rio as to me it appears to fall in the Tex-Mex category.  Pork barbacoa is terrific as are the tamales."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it was delicious. Line was a little long but customer service was good and proportions were good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm not a fan. Their tortillas are basically pita bread. So if you like super thick tortillas maybe you'll like their tacos, but for me I like thin tortillas. I want my tacos to be filled with lettuce , cheese, tomatoes, and meat. Not a pita bread with little toppings. (plus they melt the cheese into the tortilla so you can't taste it).The wheat tortilla is especially bad, super thick and grainy. I just can't justify the price of their tacos for what you get and the wait is crazy long."}
{"text":"Kind of like chipotle but on steroids in a good way.  Food seems super fresh and I love the beverages since you not only have unlimited sodas but 4 different Mexican frescas and a host of different hot sauces as well."}
{"text":"Kind of like chipotle but on steroids in a good way.  Food seems super fresh and I love the beverages since you not only have unlimited sodas but 4 different Mexican frescas and a host of different hot sauces as well. Only complaint was that the green chili was very mild, but the server told us that it was so we could add the hot sauce to spice it up."}
{"text":"Watch them like a hawk when they ring you up.    Food gets 4 stars, but I was overcharged here.  Not worth my time to battle a few dollars, but they staff is great at adding extra costs for the add ons.  And they don't tell you!  I was ordering food to go and had them put the salad dressing on the side.  I asked for both because I didn't know which would be best.  They charged me for 3!  I would be fine with an extra charge or 2 but I'm not sure how they counted 3.  I noticed they've done this to other people.  I've been several times and this doesn't happen much but it happens more often here than anywhere else.    I guess nothing comes free for here..."}
{"text":"Super friendly people and service. The location is relatively clean. I gave it a shot twice but I wouldn't recommend. The food has no appeal with all the other options in town.  People from the west coast tell me that Cafe Rio is the Chipotle here but much much better in terms of taste and authenticity. While I can kind of see where they are coming from when they talk about authentic Mexican food, this isn't really my cup of tea.  I am past the Chipotle phase of my college days but I do get cravings once in a while. Cafe Rio being conveniently close stood as an option. Both times I have tried, I could not find the appeal. First time I tried to fire grilled chicken salad. I do like that they give a lot of line but the dressing and salsa were pretty mild in taste with no kick. Their \"spicy\" was not one bit spicy. The vinegarette was beyond oily, I felt like I was eating leaves in an oil soup. The second time I tried the enchilada (was feeling fat). The burrito was not stuffed, I felt that I was eating mostly tortilla. The greens on the side was a nice addition but overall it really didn't have any taste... I left very unsatisfied and upset why I had gave it another shot. Oh well."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of the location. The food is always so good. Sometimes the portion size is inconsistent, but it always tastes great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! I love how they have different specials everyday, especially the coconut shrimp tacos on tuesdays, one of my favorites! The staff has always been super friendly, food pretty awesomely good and has always been a great experience. I've even turned a few people on to it!"}
{"text":"I love there food here but just experience one of grosses thing ever a worker used the same glove to clean with a dirty rag and swipe the excess food off the counter. Then handle the food with the same glove. Rating this place a 2 because of the food but after seeing that I couldn't eat the food. Someone can get real sick off the bacteria in that dirt rag."}
{"text":"Its hit or miss whenever i come here. The staff is rude and some look stoned. The portions depend on whos making your food. So you could go there and get your moneys worth or you could go there and get ripped off with small portions.  The punch card is a joke the staff will try often restamp the same spot making it look like one stamp. They're not very engaging with the customers most of the time they are having their own conversations or texting."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite, ended up getting the chips and salsa which were tasty and not too mention at a great price!"}
{"text":"First time visit, I came by because Flame Broiler next door was closed early.    Opted for the grilled chicken taco plate.  Grilled chicken apparently has an up charge of $1 but ok sure let's try it.   Server was nice to out my lettuce in a separate cup as I was take-out and hate warm soggy lettuce.    The rice was ok.  Mellow in flavor, pinto beans were ok, had a nice smoky flavor.   Grilled chicken was not so great.  When it was warmed on the grill it was dried out and chewy .  Desperately needed to be doused in the Pico which was like 90% tomato 8% green onion and 2% cilantro.  Zero jalapeño .  The best part was the tortillas.  Soft and kinda chewy in a good way.     Next time I'll make it a point to get to flame broiler before they close.  I was not impressed"}
{"text":"OH my this place sucks!! I order a burrito witch usually has beans rice Pico degallo and salsa along with the meat of your  choice. Well my burrito had rice beans and some nasty red sauce that taste like ketchup and the beans taste like BBQ beans. it made me sick to my stomach. Also i had order two burritos one with stake and the other pork, and i got both pork probably because the people that work there are like robots they don't really listen to you. Also there horchata water taste funny. This place is not good at all."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, however, this location is the worst!  Poor customer service and very small portions.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good fresh food. The staff is professional and courteous and the food tastes great. Fresh made tortillas and everything is made to order."}
{"text":"Nothing like driving to get some food only to be tuned away. Apparently they closed and had a Christmas party when they are usually open."}
{"text":"I came in & it was dead only one in place. Service was good. Having a shredded chicken burrito.  Was good.   My only observation was the soda bar was a little dirty & a worker left coffee/tea bags & filters on bar. Other then that was good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here one other time and would describe it as \"meh\". My first encounter took place about 6 months ago on a Wednesday during the lunch rush - high noon.  It was busy, but no big deal. As I got up to order though, the worker at the start of the line started yelling at me- like, YELLING at me \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????\" It immediately gave a prison mess hall vibe. Not to mention that the 37 people in front of me were not even starting to move any closer to the register so chill, homie. I ordered a chicken burrito. $1 extra for grilled chicken, on a $8 burrito... Somebody should tell these guys that it costs more to braise something for 3 hours than it does to grill it for 10 minutes. Throw some thighs on the grill and hit it with a little lime juice and salt and call it a day,  but dont charge extra for chicken- CHICKEN. He threw some rice, beans, and shredded chicken in a tortilla, and went for the sauce ladle in an attempt to slather everything in sauce and cheese. Enchilada-style is another up sell I am not interested in, and he seemed put off at my refusal. Then he sent it through a conveyor belt toaster oven exactly like a Quiznos sandwich. When it came out the other end I had to wait a good 9 minutes to seal the deal because there were so many other people's food in front of mine. It seems like you would want to put all the ingredients in a burrito before you roll it, but not Cafe Rio. They prefer to unroll and reroll after toasting it. Finally, some girl grabbed my cold-toasted-shredded-chicken burrito and asked if I want anything else in it. I was over it and said no to put myself out of my misery, and paid $12 for a chicken, rice, and bean burrito, with a small fountain drink. There was no trace of salt present in any one of the 4 ingredients, and it fell apart the second I picked it up. You would think that if someone does nothing but roll burritos day-in and day-out, and yells at people about their burritos, that guy can probably roll a pretty goddam good burrito. He totally didnt. I came by to give them another chance tonight. It was 9:30 pm and they close at 11. The guy that previously yelled at me and gave me a shitty burrito wrap was eating at one of the tables toward the front, and another young guy was at first base on the line stuffing tortillas. I was looking to go big so I ordered a GRILLED chicken burrito and a taco  to boot. His response: \"We don't have any more grilled chicken.\" They didn't run out of chicken- they decided not to grill any more chicken. I know this because when I asked for clarification he pointed to the two cooks in the back, threw them under the bus and told me they weren't making any more.  I would have overlooked my first experience but this is dumb. I'm sitting here now eating my delicious Teriyaki Madness because they are friendly and competent, and the cooks don't decide to stop working an hour-and-a-half before the posted closing time.  Bravo, Cafe Rio"}
{"text":"So unfortunate given the quality of the food.  The worst service I've ever received.   The girl behind the counter acted like I ruined her day when I ordered my food.   Every request seemed like I was asking her for money.   I will NEVER return!!!#"}
{"text":"Had one of their special Chile Rellenos the other day.... it was HORRIBLE!!!!! First, it was stuffed with sweet meat of some kind with an unpleasant texture, the breading was badly made and very spotty, not well covered at all, then I requested their Spicy Salsa and it was sweet as well (what gives?!?!) BUT the worst part of the whole thing was that the chiles were not deseeded so you got a mouthfull of seeds in every bite. VERY BAD!!!!!! On the side I had some Uncle Ben's Rice which was cold. I'm sorry but this was a terrible meal and I don't know how Cafe Rio gets away with stuff like this, I realize this is not Mexican Food but Tex Mex, but even then there are good meals to be had just not here."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio! The restaurant is always cleaned. Well clean enough. The music is a good vibe. It doesn't play Spanish music so it's not your typical Mexican restaurant.   The service is ok. Not much of an interaction with their staff being that they just make your food. Overall good service.  I always get the grilled chicken quesadilla. It has always been perfect the way I want it.  The ONLY reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because of its to go ordering system. I have never had my food right with a to go order here. Now. With that said they did make it right and gave me a few free meals out of it. But that was only one time and on one order.   Other than that it's a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that my visit went so poorly. I usually attend the one on Stephanie because I work in that area but one night I decided to change things up and grab food on the way home.  Started off by ordering a kids quesadilla (usually free) then ordered my food. Got to the part of the line where you ordered queso and well they were out? Then I asked for an 8 ounce Fresca and a bag of chips. They had Fresca but didn't have any chips? When I got to the counter to check out the girl working the register yelled back and asked, \"are we out of chips?\" The person that served me yelled \"yes\" and the person in the back yelled \"no.\" At the same time. : )  Turns out they had chips. Still no queso. The person serving me had asked the girl at the register to not charge me for the Fresca and chips since they were out of queso. I guess it was supposed to be a nice gesture to make things right.  I didn't pay attention to the final cost just handed over my debit card. I guess what threw me off was the girl sniffing my food and telling me my food smelled like McDonalds.  Total bill was over $21.00  My food  Kids quesadilla $5.99 Pint of Fresca not 8 ounces I learned $5.99  Man. This hurt my Cafe Rio morale."}
{"text":"It is a HEALTH HAZARD to eat here!! Tonight was the absolute worse that I've seen this location be. The food counter was atrocious, nothing was being cleaned up. We couldn't find a single clean table and the floor was dirty. Then my husband and I both lost our appetite as we witnessed an EMPLOYEE WALKING INTO THE BATHROOM WITH HIS APARON ON!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Line was horribly long and waited 15 minutes before I ordered.  I ordered the burrito with shredded chicken.  Food was average at best.  Honestly, Chipotle is better as far as portions and taste.  Food was cold by the time I started eating.  Not going back."}
{"text":"What a great place. I love the west coast but I have never been to this the whole 5 years I had lived out here. I would choose this over chipotle or qdoba any day! A lot of great tasting food for cheap"}
{"text":"First time we tried this place so i'll give it 3 stars. The food was fresh but barely warm. We came in at 8:45 p and it was moderately busy (a few people in line)  Food looked Fresh.  I have never been to a cafe Rio ever so, this was my first impression. This place is kinda like Rubios meets Chipotle. My favorite thing about the place was the small menu which made it easy to order but, 'Note-To-Owner' if you are going to put your make line right in front for all of your customers to see  -- there's an expectation that your staff will keep it cleaner than usual. Yikes!  I would expect to see a restaurant in this shape if it had had an absentee owner -- not a brand new restaurant 3 weeks old.  The make line was Gross. Dried beans, empty bins, food everywhere. The window guard was dirty with cream sauce and who knows what.   Then as we were eating they started taking down the hood filters for cleaning -- over the grills and make line. While people were standing in line ordering food. Seriously? I dont know who was in charge ( There in lies the main problem-- if you go to any fast food chain restaurant a customer can always spot the manager in a minute) i couldn't here.  Really three weeks in ??? I counted 8 staff at least and yet the floor in the dining area was filled with litter, paper, and stuff, we left in :30 minutes and nothing had changed (thats when i decided to take some photos so all y'all wouldnt think i was just being nasty). The garbage was still overflowing, tables that needed to be cleared off & wiped down etc. We will give them a chance to get their act together then try it again.  But check out these pictures. It was disturbing that no one behind the counter felt this was off in the least. I dont want to imagine what the back of the house looked like.?  I really hope they get it together and get some strong management in place -  they need it badly."}
{"text":"The food is fine.  I was more disappointed in price and atmosphere. I paid $13 for a chicken quesadilla and soda.  Its literally chic, cheese, and 1 tortilla. I received a \"small scoop\" of both sour cream and guac. Could not have been more than a tablespoon each.  But what was more frustrating was hearing 2 young lady employees bickering with each other. They were trying to put together takeout orders, which was obvious from the restaurant tables being covered in boxes and orders.  I don't like to stress about if ill have a table to sit at! The tables that didn't have boxes had post its stuck to them with numbers.  Are they reserved, are they for a large party? Who knows!  The place continued to get even busier with the lunch rush.  The boxes and orders never moved.  Oh, and lets not forget The constantly ringing restaurant phone that no one ever answered!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Pork here! The best Cafe Rio is still the best with a full service Drink bar. They charge extra for the Horchata and Lemonade here. So sososo good though with the best quesadilla ever. Pass on the chips and salso though."}
{"text":"I am torn now, because I LOVE Qdoba, but the Pork here is unreal and the drink bar is great! One more in love visit and they will get 5 stars and replace Qdoba."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cafe Rio on numerous occasions and this last time really annoyed me. So I ordered my salad and noticed that she put a plain tortilla (without it put on the grill with cheese) so I asked and she told me that they don't do that anymore because ppl have allergies. Well every time I come in they did it without asking. So she should have asked how I want it. Then she rolled her eyes at one of her coworkers at something they did. It took about 35 mins to get through the line of about 13 people in front of me. Nobody was welcoming or friendly. The location on Durango is so much better. I would rate my experience this time a 2 and the food a 4."}
{"text":"This place has the best food!!!!! But the eating experience is so bad. I have been here 2 times when they have run out of forks. Tip: don't run out of forks when your 2 biggest items are burritos and salads. Today they were out of serving trays. The tables are often dirty because they don't often come around cleaning. The line is super slow usually. The management does not seem to incorporate the Cafe Rio culture here. Normally they yell out things and keep things fun and entertaining. Not here.   I come here because of convenience to my house and the food is seriously amazing. But I often drive past this one to go to Henderson. Long drive, but it's worth it to not have such a bad eating experience. I have even told their corporate office about the problems here but they haven't done anything to fix things."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Cafe Rio. I've heard so many good things about this place my husband and I had to see what all the fuss was about!   The atmosphere is very family friendly. If your looking for a quite place to have a romantic date I would not choose here. They do have seating outside at this location which would be nice on a not so hot night.  We went during dinner and decided to take it home.  Cafe Rio has a large selection of Mexican food items. They also have a large selection of proteins to choose from, including salmon and a veggie option. We both had a very hard time deciding what to choose! I was torn between the burrito, nachos and salad. In the end I got a chicken salad with the house dressing and my husband got the sweet pork barbacoa. We decided to get the queso dip with salsa and chips as well. It's an assembly style restaurant much like Chipotle.  I really enjoyed my shredded chicken salad.  They fill a large house made tortilla with rice, beans, chicken, lettuce, pico, cheese, guacamole, and their house made salad dressing. All the ingredients were very fresh and they gave a very large portion. I ate the rest for lunch the next day. My husband after much debate ordered the sweet pork barbacoa burrito. The pork was to sweet for his liking. He told me that he wished you could combine the beef barbacoa from Chipotle into the burrito from Cafe Rio. The queso dip was spicier then I expected, but the salsa was surprisingly tasty. The spice of the queso was not to much just not what I was thinking it would be. They gave a good portion of dip and chips that it was worth the $5.  For fast Mexican food that is a little healthier then Roberto's i'd choose here again. But I really wouldn't go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Definitely deserves the five stars  very clean place, and the food was delicious!  The employees were very nice and helpful on help me and my sister out because it was our first time."}
{"text":"First time being here, and it's amazing! It's delicious, I got the chicken quesadilla with chips and salsa. So so good! The tortilla and tortilla chips are homemade which makes the food 10x better! Good, friendly, service! :) Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"got the nachos had choices of meets and topings. Place was clean. Customer service was okay but understandable because sit was rush hour. Meat portion that came with the nacho was small for a $10 nacho."}
{"text":"This location is always empty when I come in later at night which is nice. For the first 6 months I went there, no problems. However, the last 5 or so times I've come in I've been up charged extra for my burrito without warning or have been charged for multiple scoops of sour cream even though I've only asked for one or have just been flat out up charged for no reason. I notice the turnover in this place is ridiculous, that could have to do with the management or the way they pay employees but I'm tired of this location and Stephanie is too far away for a daily commute. Oh well no more Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Food is good but they're still learning and super slow. With 5 people ahead of me it took 30 minutes to get through the line."}
{"text":"While the food tastes good, I just can't rate this place any higher. They are ridiculously slow. And if you order any kind of meat entree (and most do), they are so skimpy on the meat it is just really disappointing. Sorry Cafe Rio, I wanted to like you."}
{"text":"chipotle-esque in that is assembly style serving, but chipotle is better.   As has been mentioned, sweet pork option is tender and tasty, and they have great tortillas that are fluffy and grilled.   the perks end there.  The guac is mediocre (coming from Cali I have high standards, but still) the rice is riceroni-esque.    the only things you get in your taco are pico de gallo which I could make better at home myself and lettuce.    an okay option if you're tired of chipotle or other options, but meh in my book."}
{"text":"Worst location. My family of 4 eat cafe rio twice a week. Why, well because my husband loves their shrimp. It's happened multiple times I go here wait in the long line. To find out \"they ran out of shrimp\". Funny every other location I've been to in town when they don't have shrimp  pre-made they are happy to make it. We just have to wait a few minuets. Here they find it acceptable to lie to customers and get attitude when I don't want to choose a different meat. The girl shouldn't  have taken it so personal, that's the only reason I stopped in. Tuesday's and Saturday's are they days we eat there. Biggest disappointment was I saw another employee walking around with a plate full of shrimp, packing it up for her to take home for herself.  They also rand out of habanero sauce.   This is not the first time I have had issues with this locations customer service, I've been charged for items we didn't order, and given a difficult time about orders we've made in the past by an employee I haven't seen in a while.   Poor customer service, poorly prepared for rush times  I have made it clear to my husband that our money will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"This was the worse location I been to. My food wasn't even fully cooked. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The meat sits in a disgusting amount of grease and the servers behind the line don't even make an effort to drain out the grease before they dump the meat on your plate.   Upon checking out my steak salad, I wasn't even offered a beverage....awesome.   Food quality would've been better if My taco salad didn't have a pool of liquid grease on the bottom...now I can't even eat the tortilla because it's drenching. Such a shame because the tortilla is really good too.  Awesome sauce, pun not intended."}
{"text":"Love their bean and rice burrito. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. Everything is made fresh and the silly sayings the employees chant keep the atmosphere fun."}
{"text":"This location has horrible customer service, portions are a lot smaller. I ordered a coconut flan and the lady didn't bother to cut my strawberries and did not put whip cream on my flan. Centennial location has way better customer service and actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"Oh man oh man, I'm a big fan of Cafe Rio.  No bigger fan.  Well, maybe, but I'm a pretty huge fan LOL.  I like the new location.  It's in a small detached building in a huge strip mall.  There's ample parking and lots of big windows.  The place is big and has a lot of seating.  I like the bright colors and the different shaped table tops.  The place is clean and flows very well for me.  Although it's getting colder, I do appreciate the outside seating option as well.    I've been to that new location twice in one week because A.) it's closer to my apartment and B.) it's worth every cent.  Their pork barbacoa is just something else!  I always get the pork barbacoa salad for around  $8.  It's huge!  Start with a homemade tortilla, lined on the bottom of a tin container.  The tortilla is heated up on the flat top with melted cheese.  You then pick between two kinds of beans and rice.  Then comes the pork.  A nice heaping tongful of this magical meat.  Sounds weird but I have dreams about it.  After that, they load the container with lettuce (I prefer the shreaded lettuce because it means more lettuce and less unused space), cilantro, crispy tortilla strips and a scoop of guacamole.  For the dressing, I prefer the vinaigrette.  Let me just tell you.  I feel as if you don't need dressing.  The barbacoa part of the pork is sweet and just a little tangy.  The black beans and rice really compliment the entire dish and mixed with everything else, you've really got a fulfilling combination.    I could literally go blue in the face, telling you how much I love it there, but you need to try it for yourself.  This place has got it going on!  I beg you all to get in your cars and visit Cafe Rio for the pork barbacoa.  You will NOT be disappointed :) oh and you're welcome in advance..."}
{"text":"The place is always too crowded or I would give it five stars. The food is always great and the service is always top notch. Just make sure you have some extra time when you go to eat because it is always packed."}
{"text":"So I have to say I've always loved Cafe Rio, but today has had to be the worst service EVER. Yes I know it gets busy what restaurant doesn't. I called in my order & was given a 20 min pick up time, I get there 30 min later order wasn't even started on. Manager says \"O sorry we are out of rice did they not tell you\" meanwhile I had already been sitting waiting for almost 20 more minutes. To top it OFF when they FINALLY had my order ready it wasn't even Right! I don't know if there's new management at this location but it keeps getting worse as time goes on!"}
{"text":"Went here last summer on grand opening day when visiting the new Fry's area (have lived 2 miles away for 10 years so a new development) to try something new in the way of Mexican (having used Chipotle 95% of the time). Was very different flavor-wise and the menu items were a tad unfamiliar so went for basic chicken salad. Honestly was not impressed by the way they assembled the to go dish and the choice of add-ons for sauces, cheese etc. but tried it again a month later and have not been back since. Too much leafy lettuce to give volume and not enough flavor in the prepared chicken. Also felt the employees were rushed in throwing orders together and running around to get chips and other items at checkout. Maybe it will improve over time. I see they have locations around the SE Valley so maybe will try a different one sometime."}
{"text":"Café Rio is definitely one of our regular spots (partly because we live walking distance to this location).  We love to get the pork burritos here - buyer beware that the pork is on the sweeter side.  That might turn off some people, but we really like it.  The ambience of this place is good.  Brand new and clean.  This particular location can get a bit crowded though, especially during dinner hours.  Whats especially great is that you could just walk over to the Golden Spoon next door for some dessert =).  One of my main things I like to get is their steak tostada.  It's pretty much a taco salad.  They put a hard flat taco shell at the bottom and pile it high with some rice, beans, a ton of lettuce, sour cream, cheese pico de gallo, and those little tortilla chip strips.  I think it's a good option if your kind of watching what you eat (just x out the cheese and sour cream).  I really love their creamy dressing too.  If you're getting a burrito or tacos though, look out of the extras like sour cream and guacamole though - they cost extra and they don't tell you that when you are ordering.  Overall, A-OK if your looking for a change from the normal Chipotle."}
{"text":"I feel like every time I eat here, it's always a different experience. Lately, they had an influx of new employees who take too long to prepare and don't even prepare the food right.   Also, it takes too long for them to get through a long line. We were so bored, we talked with the strangers in front of us in line.   It's not like they ever had super bomb food, ever, for a fast food restaurant, but I think I'll probably stop coming to this one. There are just way better locations."}
{"text":"My FIRST experience here was so horrible!! First off I would like to say the workers had such ugly attitudes!! Secondly the young guy that had finish making our food he did not put lids on our food and expected the other young guy working at the cashier put lids on our food without gloves touching the inside of the lids!! Yuck  Thirdly the cashier over charged us for our food and I had brought it to his attention and he argued with us which I was right.. Finally the young lady had refund the amount back to my card and wanted me to pay more for our two meals and by then I just wanted my money back.. No point to pay $25 for two meals especially here!!"}
{"text":"Normal Cafe Rio experience, just dirtier. Food was as expected, watched a lady break a hot sauce bottle on the floor, tell the workers about it, and then a customer cleaned it up after 8 minutes. Garbage cans were over flowing. My nachos tasted great."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place..the bowls are done with fresh vegetables and lettuce..just enough for two people to eat..the line is never too long and everything is prepared right in front of you.."}
{"text":"Good food but seriously some of the worst management ever. They are always understaffed, running out of food and some of the slowest employees who have no clue what they are doing. Every time I come here it ends up taking 20 minutes to get my food and starting to wonder why I keep coming back..."}
{"text":"So I have never been here before but had it catered at a wedding recently so I thought I would grab something real quick on my way home... first of all there was 2 people in front of me and it took 20 minutes.  That's ridiculous... second, I just wanted lettuce and grilled chicken and they charged me $11... for lettuce and some chicken.  I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Generally always have a great meal at Cafe Rio. Especially love the pork barbacoa salad and burrito.  Prices are reasonable and portions are generous."}
{"text":"So tonight I arrived at 8pm. There were 3 females working, the one standing by where they make the tortillas taking orders was fast, but the other two were very slow. And instead of helping with the orders that were piling up, one of them kept going to the back to get stuff to fill the containers. She would help a little bit but then leave again, and the other one was VERY slow. I get needing to get stuff from the back, but what I don't understand is the first girl just standing there instead of helping the slow employee. I literally stood in line for 15 minutes after ordering, just watching my food get cold (which it was when I received it) This location needs better management."}
{"text":"I like this place, I like this place, I like this place. The salad thing is amazing! Ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to get on a plane and eat this for lunch. Like now.  Ok- lets be real. I have no desire to come back to anything but the Strip in Vegas, but this place is good! How I wish you were in California!   Absolutely recommend. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a handful of times and it's always super packed so I recommend either ordering ahead if you're in a rush or take your time and wait in line which goes by super fast anyway.   I was in a pinch for time so I phoned in my Order for the Thursday lunch special. When I went in to pick up my order the girl at the take out station had informed me that they had ran out of Tamales and that it would be a 30 minute wait so they could make more. I only have 30 minutes on my lunch break and I had already driven there so I was a bit annoyed. I told them I had just placed my order and they should have informed me before I came there otherwise I would have delayed my order and took my break at a later time. I asked  to speak to the manager who talked to the cooks and took care of everything and I received my tamales about 10 minutes later.   I wish I would have got his name so I could write it but if you're reading this I would just like to say thank you for fixing the problem not only in a timely manner but taking care of it despite how busy you were."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is my new favorite place to eat . My friend picked me up some lunch and i said just order me a  burrito because I've never ate here before so she brought me back this huge burrito stuffed with rice and beans and chicken covered in this delicious green sauce with what looks like lettuce and salsa on the side. We also got chips and this really good cheese dip cant tell u excactly what its called because like i said my friend ordered for me .  It was really good I cant believe i have never ate here before . Definitely be oredering again to try some of the other things they have . Chipotle has definitely been replaced !"}
{"text":"This is a favorite restaurant of my daughter who lives nearby. There were four in our party - the first three were served by a gentleman who was very generous with everything put on their salad including the mahi mahi. Because they ran out of mahi mahi, I was served by the woman who was cooking it, and she was just as cheap with her servings as her coworker was generous. I wondered if anyone would notice my small salad when I got to our table, but they were too \"into\" their delicious meals."}
{"text":"Yesterday our meeting went long so our boss bought us all lunch from Café Rio. I was very impressed - there were nine of us, and each lunch box was marked with exactly what was in it, which made it easy to see which lunch went to which person.  AND the food was excellent!  About the only thing I can think of that would've improved it, would have been if they had delivered."}
{"text":"I should have gotten the salad! That's what I went for.  So as usual.  As soon as you get up to the glass it's a marathon for the workers!  How fast can they get you through!  Don't ask too many questions ( ummmm attention Cafe Rio Some people aren't regulars!  Be patient)  I had a few questions, and I felt like I was annoying the guy.  So I ended up getting the shredded beef enchiladas.  It was soooooooooo freakin salty!  If I had eaten it there, I would have told them I wanted something else.   But the chips and salsa was really good.  I'm not sure If I will ever return.  If I'm not mistaken, I think the salad was pretty good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the restaurant. Everyone gave me a huge welcome and was very nice. I placed my order,Elizabeth rung me up (I had to ask for a stamp card, which I wasn't pleased about because everyone knew it was my first time, she should've offered it to me) I ordered a pork enchilada with black beans, red sauce and asked for it to be covered in sauce and cheese (I chose the green tomatillo sauce on top instead of red). When I got it home a few minutes later and had my first bite, something was sugary sweet all throughout the burrito. Since the pork and black beans were mixed I couldn't distinguish exactly what was causing it but my only reaction is YUCK! When I eat mexican food of any type from anywhere, I don't expect anything to be sugary sweet. Ewwwww    So I've said it before and I'll say it again, I've tried this place now too, I've tried Chipotle (which is just ok) but my heart will stay with Rubios. I've eaten there no less then 50 times (at the same location) over the past several years and I've never had a mistake or bad food there ever."}
{"text":"I had an order delivered with the family's usual burrito selection.  The burritos were not as ordered and the rice was crunchy and under cooked. I called the location and was told, \"Sorry, I'll tell the manager, goodbye! Apparently my repeat business is not wanted and will not occur. I have raved about this place to several friends. No more! I will steer them away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite stops.  The grilled chicken burrito enchilada style was my favorite.  Now, the meat seems lackluster, the enchilada sauce is bland & the burritos are mostly rice & beans, yet the price remains very high.  I used to go twice a month, now I don't make the trip."}
{"text":"My kiddos love Cafe Rio. It's definitely bit a place I would frequent much without them but as far as reasonably healthy selections, friendly service and a good rewards app ($10 in free food for every $100 you spend) it's a good option instead of fast food.   Sweet pork is my favorite, my girls like the salmon. A tip for moms: there is a free cheese quesadilla with a grown-up's purchase."}
{"text":"When I ordered my meal I couldn't hear the girl and she asked me if I wanted rice and beans, I thought she just asked if I wanted beans so I said yes, she started to put rice on my plate and I said \" if the rice has cilantro I can't eat it\".  She looked at me like I told her she had a wart on her nose. I got my meal and went to get a soda and there was no ice, no lemonade & the place looked dirty like it needed to be swept and the trash around the soda station needed picked up. It always amazes me when there's employees standing around doing nothing when there's obvious work to be done. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pork tacos, but it's a bit on the pricey side.  Speaking of side, the sides that they serve you with the meals are lacking. Wish you could get your money's worth out of this place.  I think if I was really craving mexi food I'd come back here, but due to it's price to proportion ratio, it's not some place I'd frequently visit."}
{"text":"I'm a Cafe Rio fan! Everything here is tasty and fresh. They make their own tortillas and it's one of the best I've ever had. I really like the chicken quesadilla with green sauce. The salads are delicious! They are lined with fresh tortilla and served with a heaping amount of lettuce and a good amount of the protein of your choice. I usually get the sweet pork barbacoa. The salads usually make two meals for me. As far as dressings, the creamy avocado one is the best. If you have kids, they'll give you a complimentary kid sized quesadilla...just ask! Cafe Rio's chicken tortilla soup is pretty good. The horchata is pretty good and so is the minty lemonade. Be on the lookout for coupons in the mail or online. There is usually one floating around for buy 1, get 1 free salad or burrito."}
{"text":"I hate to have to do this but please avoid this location. Cafe rio in general is great but this place needs to get it together. The last two times I've ordered online, I get there and my online order isn't ready at the time i requested. Both have been during the week at non-peak times (4:45 and 8). It's upsetting because you order online for a reason. You want your food at the time you are requesting it. The last time this happened the night manager called me and apologized and offered me a free meal which is nice and the professional thing to do so I really appreciate that but I don't want free food, I want the food I paid for to be ready when I ask- not 15 mins afterwards time after time. The staff seems like they are trying their best but they must have no concept of time or urgency unfortauntely. There are always people standing around but no one can help make the food? I'll just be going to the blue diamond location which is much faster."}
{"text":"Really good food. Chicken breast and Roast beef are both cooked and seasoned well. Good portion and sides are well done. Dining area has mellow mood and music, UNLIKE chipotle who insists on blasting your ear drums with their music, pretending to be young and hip (but not too much attention is paid to health codes, sorry can't resist!)  Will be back to try other meats"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 66/100***  I have not dined in so I can't comment on customer service nor do I even know what the place looks like as I have not set foot in the restaurant. We have ordered from this place about 4 times and what I do know is I like the taste of the food I have tried so far. Their concept is likened to Baja Fresh but offers more meat variety. Also offered on the wider range menu is a fire grilled salmon for the non meat eaters and desserts like Tres leches and Flan to top off your meal. Taste is by far superior compared to the likes.  I've had their enchiladas which were very tasty, with chicken and comes with rice and beans and your choice of hot, medium or mild sauce. Their fire grilled chicken tacos are superb as well. The sweet pork barbacoa is not one of my faves though, it has a certain sweetness that doesn't appeal to me. Yesterday I had their shredded chicken breast burrito enchilada style ($1 more to get it enchilada style) and it was humongous! It was delicious and made even better by adding their creamy tomatillo sauce on top. It may not be the best Mexican food you can get but it tops my list when it comes to Mexican fast food and way better than eating McDonalds for sure! Ask for a side of their creamy tomatillo sauce and you've got a fiesta in your mouth."}
{"text":"I actually like their food more than chipolte. Ordering is a bit confusing the first few times. But it's a great spot."}
{"text":"3.5 Star I'm not usually a huge fan of mexican food chains, but the sweet pork here is delicious!  We had a chicken enchilada, a sweet pork burrito, and 2 drinks, which came about to roughly 20 dollars.    The chicken was rather dry and nothing to write home about.  The pork was so tender and sweet.  I would definitely go back for that.  One big gripe I have about Cafe Rio is that the wall between CR staff and you is way too tall, which makes ordering very difficult.  Especially for those of us who are vertically challenged =P"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in line for a $12 salad. Staff was unfriendly, crying kids everywhere. I will NEvER go again!!food is mediocre and not worth the money and definitely  not worth the time."}
{"text":"Cold Steak, ran out of chicken, staff trained inadequately, messy dining room, whole restaurant seem to be off a beat. Yep you get one star."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I was a little confused on how to order. The signs aren't exactly clear. I had the steak nachos and they were pretty good. I brought my 4 yr old granddaughter and was very happy that I was able to order her a kids cheese quesadilla and it was free! I've had better mexican food but this was not too bad for a quick bite. Service was good."}
{"text":"I ordered my lunch online expecting to quickly walk in and out during my lunch break. When I approached the counter, 3 employees ignored me and when I was finally acknowledged, I was so disappointed to find out my meal wasn't even ready for pick up! Terrible customer service! I normally like cafe rio but this location sucks!"}
{"text":"So honestly I feel like this place is getting a bad wrap. I saw the reviews of this place but still wanted to check it out despite it only having three stars. Everyone was saying how awful the customer service was but I've only heard great things about it from friends. Despite the poor reviews about bad customer service I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I ordered the pork salad because I've heard how amazing their pork was and it definitely did not disappoint. The salad dressing/pork combo was pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"Nothings worse than having burnt chicken tacos. Not sure why anyone would ever serve black chicken to someone else..... Not to happy."}
{"text":"First time there after hearing rave reviews from my 18 yr old son who loves it.  Went at an off time so not crowded (but the parking lot at this location is terribly designed). I ordered the spicy green chili pork burrito.  It was wayyyy too sweet, even the flour tortilla tasted like sugar was added to it.  I almost thought I mistakenly ordered a \"sweet pork\" but it wasn't.  I grabbed a mint lemonade and that too was overly sweet.  Maybe it's just me but does anyone notice their food sweet? I'll give it another try again.  Still like Chipotle over this."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for 30 on Xmas Eve and we picked up.  What an overpriced mess!  Didn't get the correct food items ordered several days before online, no sterno set up, chips and salsa, utensils, plates, napkins as listed on package price.  Manager \"Addie\" terrible and kept calling me \"my friend\"....very weird.  Manager claimed they were busy but my son was in the store waiting for the missing items and he said no one was there.  Cafe Rio good when you order one plate but don't use this location's catering!"}
{"text":"This place gives you BIG portions and it will fill you up for the day (if you eat this between lunch and dinner).  I recommend the Pork Barbacoa (it is sweet.... they use Coca Cola in the recipe)  The salads are so wonderful with the creamy tomatillo dressing.  My husband loves the enchilada style chicken burrito.  It may be a little pricier than other burrito joints, but it's healthier and worth it!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever both times I've came to this location. Don't even bother ordering online because I guarantee it won't be ready by the PROMISED time. The only reason why I came back was because the new general manager was professional and apologetic."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and tried the salad with sweet pork on it and it's a new favorite...eating a salad before heading to IKEA for the 1st time"}
{"text":"This place has become a new favorite for me and my son now, if you're looking for A+ customer service this place is lacking a bit but, the food is always good and very fresh, today I ordered 2 salads which were steak (very tender strips)and salmon (cooked to perfection) and took advantage of the promotion I received for buy one get one free because if you download their app you get special perks like $5 off or the most recent buy a salad or burrito and get one free & after going there so many times you can earn $10 off your next purchase & to me, that's worth it! I gave up Chipotle for this place because it's fresher and just honestly tastes better."}
{"text":"Gringo food all the way.  Dirty and expensive no refried beans ! Two stars for the homemade tortillas.  But still really dirty.  Don't know why it's popular."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the one on Baseline and Gilbert. We have never been to such a filthy establishment, the waitress out on the floor could not keep up with the overflowing garbage cans, tend to tables, all of the Teas at the drink station were out, I asked for them to be refilled but that did not happen as she had more garbage to tend to. The floors and tables were all a mess with left over food, hardly a clean place to sit. My husband now refers to it as \"the place we got dog food from\" I hate to even give this place 1 star, but I have to for a review."}
{"text":"Worst Café Rio on the planet slow service no drinks they suck save your time and money and go to centennial Café Rio it's much better."}
{"text":"Wow. Who knew this place would know how to pack a mean burrito and taco salad. Delicious! I went in around noon and the line was almost out the door! So I guess come early? I waited about maybe 20-25 minutes before I got to order. Not bad.   Anyways, the lighting is a little dim once you step inside, but plenty of seating both indoor and out. (: Nice because who wants to sit inside when it is a nice beautiful day outside?! Anyways yes. I went with the top most favorite order. Sweet and Sour Barbacoa burrito and the taco salad.   What a surprise! Everything is so freshly made. The tortilla, the burrito, the salad. All in front of your eyes. Can't get any more fresh than that! The taste is like explosion in your mouth. Seriously it's packed with flavor. Sweet and sour from the barbacoa but tangy from the enchilada sauce and their house sauce. Yum! Taste even better with hot sauce (;  The portions are huge too!! I def had to eat my burrito over two meals. So if you are on a budget and wanting a meal to last all day. Come Here! It's good and def worth it!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was absolutely appalling. The manager should be ashamed. I dont eat meat or dairy and the woman gave me a look like my food choices were ridiculous. They they mixed up my mom and my aunts order so neither of them got what they wanted. The assembly line is rushed and disoriented it made me feel stressed. While we were eating, my aunt asked a  woman where the spoons were so she could feed her baby. The woman scoffed and pointed to the spoons. She was standing right by them and we were sittibg down eating! Instead of grabbing one for a BABY. she tried walking away but i asked her to grab one she rolled her eyes and slamed a chair down and yelled at my aunt saying do you want a fork too?! In a sarcastic tone. Sorry i went on a rant here. If you want crappy mexican food just go to taco bell because at least they will be nice to you."}
{"text":"We have been to several locations. The food at this one is consistently good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying that Cafe Rio is one of my favorite places to eat. I am from Salt Lake City where the lines are out the door at Cafe Rio and everyone loves it. With that being said I am very disappointed with the quality of this location. I ordered a steak quesadilla, which comes with sour cream only to find out after it was made that they don't have sour cream and they are out for the night. If the employee would of told me that prior to I would of ordered something else. Second they were out of Diet Coke and from going there a few times is not uncommon. Third the place is filthy, there was so much trash in the garbage cans that you couldn't throw anything away. The bathroom was disgusting and there were no paper towels. You can just tell by being there that no one cares about the business and there is clearly no leadership there. I never thought I would ever give a place I enjoy so much a terrible review, but this is not the first time this location has disappointed and by reading some of the other reviews seems like it's quit common. Hopefully this review will help to turn this place around."}
{"text":"Pork is delicious! Nachos or taco Tuesday, Cafe Rio is the way to go. It's a clean restaurant and a pretty clutch addition to the area, because I used to have to take a ride down the 101 to get my hands on this stuff!"}
{"text":"Love Cafe Rio, super excited this location is so close to home.  Smaller location then the others but they seem to be handling the line well.  Staff is smiling and pleasant, I hope they keep it up!  Food tastes fresh and hot.  The steak salad is a must with the tomatillo dressing...  and whatever you do always get a side of freshly cooked tortillas, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Worst Cafe Rio!! Terrible service and not that great of food. Never coming back here. The service is terrible and ran by a bunch of high school kids that don't care one bit. They burnt my sons quesadilla and then made us wait forever to finish our order while the staff was goofing off with other employees."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the enchiladas and burritos here. The salads are excellent as well. Not a big fan of their salsa though. We usually do take out and use our own salsa. But the meat is always fresh and the rice and beans are excellent. There's usually a little bit of a wait but they move along pretty quick. Highly recommend this place. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Fresh homemade tortillas. Takes the food to another level. Enchilada style burritos are the best of both worlds. Lots of good meat choices. But seriously I can't get over how amazing the tortillas are. Next time I go I'm just going to ask for a few on the side."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is one of my favorite food places, but my last few visits I haven't been impressed with this location. They don't put much in the salads, and it doesn't taste fresh. They are pretty nice with the customer service but the food, i'm not impressed with."}
{"text":"What a sad place, to work in and to buy food from. The employees were so uninterested in their customers and so rude to each other. I never buy from this location because it's not near my house (thank god), but that was the area I was in yesterday afternoon. Super disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and friendly service. Try the salad with the sweet pork, yum!  The premises are nice and clean, except for the bathrooms. They could use more frequent attention."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. They don't listen to your order and they charge for every single side of salsa. My friend ordered a taco and got a burrito. She didn't say anything because it's the lunch rush and we had waited long enough. $1.00 for a side of pico that I wanted on top of the tacos. Another $1.00 for a side of enchilada sauce. $6.99 meal ended up to be almost $9.00! Go thing Taco Bell is in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Never ordered online but food was excellent and made quick. Service was good. No complaints. Again, I have never ordered online"}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio Is Simply Amazing! Great Customer Service & Food Is So Fresh!! We Live Closer To The One On Durango But I Drive Here For Their 1st Class Customer Service!!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a -1 I would. This place maybe new but they are simply horrible!! Understaffed, extremely long wait times; lastly managers and staff are extremely rude!! My daughter had a bone in her chicken Burrito so we took it up to the counter and they argued with us about being half eaten, and that they wouldn't do anything for us in front of other customers, I was mortified!! And will never go back there again!! This Is the picture of the bone that was in my daughters burrito!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food...... However, I've ordered online five separate times. Each time I received the wrong order and each time was a different wrong order. Do yourself a favor and just go stand in line, don't order online. The other problem I have is the last time I picked up food there, there was a homeless person with a sign begging for food/money asleep with a of his belongings at a table in the dining area. In the end, it's good if you just go there, order your food there, and take it to go. Otherwise you'll be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time going. I absolutely loved it. I got the. Tacos plate and it was very good. I also loved the green salsa they had I don't know if it was cucumber or something like that but it was awesome. All the staff was friendly and very nice. I will defenitly go back."}
{"text":"I got the bottom of the bucket shredded chicken, so it was like slop. It was already plopped on my burrito, so I let it slide. And yeah, my burrito was awfully wet because of it, but at least it was edible. And the drink options are one of my favorite things about Cafe Rio, and three of them were empty. Two inoperable, and the third was filled, so I was able to enjoy the lemonade. Now, my friend had an unpleasant customer service encounter with Julio. She shared her grievance with corporate, but it was pretty unruly; I had to laugh."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time at this location, they were in  the middle of their dinner rush so the line was super long. Probably waited 15 minutes. Quite possible they were understaffed that night I'm not too sure. But people think that they will be in and out in a breeze with this restaurant, they literally put your food through the oven thing, are cooking the tacos on the stove, and oh yeah a lot of people like to bring their whole family and order everything off the menu, don't keep in the back of your mind that this is a fast food restaurant, especially when you come during a rush. So I had to wait 15 minutes, but for how busy they were i could see why. The girl who first took my order though seemed really really stressed. She wasn't rude, she was just rushing people. The only thing concerning was that their lettuce seemed really really wet. Like in a pool of water and they were scrapping the bits. Don't you dry that? My food was good though , worth the wait."}
{"text":"Eh. Not very good. Not sure I'd be back for anything other than tortilla chips and beverage station."}
{"text":"Yum doesn't do it justice. Everything here is yummy, fresh, and put together in front of you. Sometimes the line can be long, especially lunch and dinner, so I call my order in (or use their app) and go pick it up. They have great specials during the week, and have a frequent client points that accumulate and earn you free drinks and meals. The restaurant is very colorful."}
{"text":"We are still obsessed with this place after dozens of meals.   I wasn't a salad for a meal type of guy before being exposed to their menu, but that has all changed.  If you order a sweet pork, steak or chicken salad for a meal you will be blown away!  The vinaigrette dressing is my favorite.  There's even limes and guacamole!  It is to die for.  I love all their staff, but I'm going to call out Bri because she is just Aaaaaaamazing.  She was gone for a few weeks and when she got back we were so happy."}
{"text":"This cafe rio is a nightmare. Zero management. The man who is the manager seems sooooo oblivious to the problems in his store. Instead of asking me to download your app, it would make more sense to work on customer service, which would encourage people to come back. Also, it consistently looks filthy."}
{"text":"The good: the sweet pork quesadilla is really tasty, as are the nachos. One of the cooks made up songs while he worked and was quite funny.  The bad: when we were there on a moderately busy Sunday night, the place was an absolute mess. The garbage cans were full, there were 0 clean tables, drink station was a mess, some confusion with orders, and most of the employees seemed like they would rather be anywhere else. Some pretty minor improvements could make a much better fast casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE mexican food and was not Impressed at all. First off service was BAD and establishment was DIRTY. the burrito tastes pretty much like a soupy slop burrito , eww. The leche cake WAS GOOD tho. Other than that I'll stick with any other Mexican food place. Cuz this one is just not all that."}
{"text":"Come in 35 minutes before closing and I'm greeted by silence and annoyed stares. Ummm? Not good for business. How embarrassing and pathetic. No wonder this location barely has 2 stars. I'd rather drive the extra 10 minutes to a different one."}
{"text":"I had the best burrito of my life here. The order/pickup process is a little quirky, but, all-in-all, a really good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"My Mexican food standards are pretty high and everyone SWORE by this place so I finally tried it a few months ago.  If I'm going to suffer the plight of diarrhea, I'd at least like some flavor to make it worth it.  I would truly prefer eating frozen burritos over this place.    I'd also like to know who provided this restaurant with a single dollar sign.  I paid $12 for a soft tortilla on the bottom of my taco salad, bland meat and sparse, tasteless cheese sprinkled on top with a side of the nastiest salad dressing I've ever had.  Oh, and a small drink cup.   I had to shout my order across the noise to the person making my order and could barely hear the questions being asked.  I might have verbally agreed to the assassination of someone being held hostage in the kitchen, I'll never know.   Normally, that sort of thing doesn't bother me with this style of  restaurant (the shouting, not assassination), but this was worse than a bar on a Saturday night hosting 5 21st birthday parties.  And the atmosphere?  Kids everywhere, kids screaming and kids dropping their food and crying. I'm not a kid person, but the parent to child ration was 1:3 and that could shake anyone trying to eat lunch.  The tables were so close together you had to ask the guests behind you to scoot forward so you could get out and the tables were built around the waiting line so the people in line had the pleasure of watching you eat and you had the pleasure of being uncomfortable. I could go on and on, but you get the gist of it.    Every offer for free lunch to this place has been declined every since that first visit, I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I tend to make hipster choices when it comes to my food: the more obscure, the better. It's this reasoning that always made me inclined to dislike Cafe Rio. \"Bleh, another Mexican chain? Psh, be more original!\"  Then I had the Barbacoa tostada. Holy crap, I wanted to punch myself for such hipster tendencies. Moist, flavorful, and mass quantities for only six bucks? I am so sorry I doubted you Cafe Rio. You can't go wrong with a tortilla smothered in beans, rice, slow-cooked pork, lettuce, cotija cheese, tortilla strips, and a creamy tomatillo sauce. The tostada resembles a salad more so than its namesake, and honestly, by the time I got to the tortilla, it was so soaked I just tossed it. But everyone's right, the barbacoa is the way to go - at times I'd catch my friend glancing at my pork enviously in between bites of her inferior chicken."}
{"text":"i think its a case of to stupid to get a real job!!!!! Simple fucking request NO CHEESE!! How dumb do you have to be to not be able to follow one simple request for a lactose intolerant person!! Even Taco Bell & Del Taco can get this right.. so now after spending $9 on a UNFRESH salad tht has old limp lettuce and made incorrectly i have to go spend more money for an actual lunch because these idiots dont understand what NO CHEESE means! Worst lunch experience EVER never again will i deal with simple fucks in a simple place with stale food!!! YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS you must work here because you failed at Taco Bell because you cant take direction."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. The food is pretty good. Know that the \"hot\" salsa is not hot at all. It has a nice taste, but it's just not hot. I knew this the second time and asked for the spicy habanero, but they were out. Prices are decent. You can watch them make your tortilla shell."}
{"text":"I continue to have bad experiences here.  I keep coming back because it's close to where I work, but I've had enough.  I can tell they have high turn over because they have different people working there all the time.  Maybe if they hired the right people it would make for better customer service.  The taste of the food is the only reason I gave two stars.  The consistency of the quantity of the food is poor. I pay the same price for the salad, but it is pretty much all tortilla and lettuce now.  Not that I need huge super sized portions, but just the standard portion I'm become used to at other locations.  Lastly, because it's a place I always enjoy, one of my friends gave me a gift card for Cafe Rio. When I went to pay, the girl behind the counter told me it wasn't working and that I needed another payment method.  I wish I could get some good old cafe rio service back."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had tacos that bad, there is absolutely nothing authentic about the tacos. Cilantro had stems attached, no onions, the tortilla is more like pita bread. $9.50 for 2 tacos without rice and beans is just ridiculous. First time and last time I'll go. Will have to search for better place."}
{"text":"Just ok. They seem sloppy behind the line.  Never fails, they serve me a soggy tortilla every time. Staff seems unhappy. Dining room could use some attention as far as cleanliness."}
{"text":"The sweet pork is really too sweet for me personally, but the steak burrito enchilada style is the best I have ever had...this place is great, avoid during lunch hours the wait will get to be ridiculous"}
{"text":"Thee worst place to order online. Twice I've ordered from this place and has messed up my order.  Ordered a toastada both time with extra dressing on the side and both time has not given me my dressing..  How does someone eat dry a** salad?! They offered to remake the meal when I called but who's gonna pay for my gas? This place is just a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Cafe rio is good, but not this location. The service here is terrible. I guess we do need to keep checking the bag, with a family of five, but that's not an excuse. For the quality of the food, it's definitely not worth it. Even though we do have a family, five that's no excuse for how much time it takes. Almost took 60 minutes for 2 quesadillas, 2 salads, and 1 taco that's nowhere near how much it would take to go to a drive through nearby that is much better. They definitely need to step up their quality if they want more money and service."}
{"text":"I could eat the creamy tomatillo dressing on EVERYTHING! It's actually the reason I find myself coming back to Cafe Rio and ordering their salads which are served over a fresh homemade tortilla.   I feel the chile roasted shredded beef has a good overall flavor but is frequently too salty. I also wasn't a huge fan of the wet burrito, the green sauce I tried was actually a little sweet which was not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Service is amazing. Good taste great as well. I live in Los Angeles and we have the best authentic Mexican cuisine in Southern California and I can say as a Californian that this place rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at Cafe Rio. This is the worst experience I have ever had here. It's 7:30 on a Saturday and they are out of pork, green sauce, scrambling to find chicken and no concern for the well being if their customers. Our food is cold. The Pico is brown. The women in front of me asked for green sauce and they looked around and just said nope we are out. Didn't offer to make more or give her other options. My boyfriends Steak was tough as if it had been sitting out for too long. I asked the employee to put cheese on my salad tortilla as that's how they have always come without asking and she made me feel inconvenienced. There are dirty plastic gloves on the floor and a worker has walked by several times without picking it up. There is clearly a lack of supervision.  If I were the GM, I would want to know. Terrible experience. I love Cafe Rio and it might be a long time before I come back. This place used to be so good."}
{"text":"During lunch the service is fast and friendly. For dinner, the service is slow and rude. The meal is usually good quality which keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Go to Zaba's. They don't change you for extra sauce, extra this, extra that. Then your $24 into 2 burritos and one drink. Not happy that I didn't know all that was extra till I paid. I'm done here.  Zaba's and Chipotle just keep piling it on."}
{"text":"The food was good however the service was a little off. Little things matter like Making sure the bathrooms are clean and the trash is not overflowing"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, but service so bad. My mom and i went and the girl that was at the register had the worst attitude, and had horrible customer service. It's not that hard doing math. Also, someone on line was told to get guacamole, so the girl did and she dropped some on the table, and put it in the customers container! No gloves, and a health hazard/cross contamination. Just horrible in general."}
{"text":"The food here is usually delicious! The price can add up fairly quickly, although the ingredients seem to be fresh. The service is mediocre, and the bathroom is decently clean. Parking is limited, and the chairs hurt my butt. Why did I give them 3 stars? Read below!  Pros: Food quality seems to be fresh. Lighting is bright. Music isn't loud. You can have a conversation. Ordering is simple and easy. You can see what they put into your meal.  Cons: Bathroom is a single toilet. Seats are wooden. Not a tasteful variety of drinks for my taste. Line can be long at random times in the day. Parking is limited.  Overall, I like coming here on my lunch break. The workers are pretty nice and the food always tastes great. It's a decent diminish experience."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. I've been here literally 20 times but man...... What's with the Amigo this and Amigo that? Kinda weird. Great food and service"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Love the food.  I'm addicted to the chips and queso.  Try the chicken enchiladas if you get a chance."}
{"text":"I counted 19 workers behind the counter on my last visit. This restaurant is big on making their food from scratch, and has to staff up for cooking, I guess. We've eaten here three times, ordered the same food, but it tasted completely different each time. One time the the green sauce was very salty, the next time it was overly sweet, and the last time it was flavorless. I'm not sure if I was served the same sauce or it was made differently each time.  The workers make the food fresh, so it is nice to watch the food being cooked as we wait for our dish.  Picking up our food when it is done being cooked is confusing. The workers do not know what you ordered, so they ask, then search the food recently cooked for your order. We've had missing items and notice them as we start to pay. The workers usually cannot find the item and have to re-make them. This has also happened to the people around me, so it appears to be typical."}
{"text":"Wow, this was a big let down.  I brought my friends and family here with high expectations , but the food was overpriced and looked nothing like the menu.  We love Mexican food,  and this place was below average.  It is like \"fast food\" quality for \"sit down restaurant \" price. The food is on par with Chipotle or Filibertos."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers, I am a fan of the menu offered at Cafe Rio. This, and many other Las Vegas locations, seem to be lacking direction, management, training and an overall concern for their offering. This restaurant is no different - except for a few very helpful/friendly staff - the location was very dirty, fountains were empty, floors, tables, and condiment areas were very unkempt and dirty. The wait was longer than 30 minutes and the food was terrible.   After taking nearly 40 minutes to get our food the fire grilled chicken in our burritos was burnt. It was pointless to try to fix it now that our lunch hour was over.   The unfortunate thing is that this is the attitude and demeanor of almost every Cafe Rio in town."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was good!   The overall vibe of the store was low and made me feel like none of the employees wanted to be there. If the employees hate the place why should customers want to come? I foresee a needed manager change.  The place was blown out yet there were only a few customers. The line was extremely slow and no one appeared happy to be serving customers.   The dining room and drink station were a wreck. In fact the signs above the horchata and strawberry lemonade were mixed up and the employee told me that they just never changed the signs and I should be able to figure out which drink was which?  How about we fix the signs and clean the area instead of arguing about my ability to interpret which beverage is mislabeled? I can see a diabetic consuming the wrong beverage and suing.  Overall, food was great. Everything else was poorly managed. I agree with other reviewers that this location is \"ghetto\"."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has dropped to 2 stars for service, speed, food quality and cleanliness. Even direct emails to the chain office have gone unanswered. So if the headquarters doesn't care... Why would the store? Sad because this used to be the go to location and had excellent food and service.   Every local location I have been to in the last six months exhibits the same \"could care less\" demeanor."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and a busy location. I have eaten here several times, and the staff are always outgoing. On this last visit, the male manager could have stayed off the line and not been so loud and annoying. I definitely prefer to be served by the employees."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because the cashier was rude and argumentative. I do not like it when the service forgets who the customer is, and that I have a choice where I spend my money. The food was excellent,and the service up until the cashier was perfect. This was the second time that this same lady was rude, the management should not have her communicating with customers. The bathrooms were dirty, and the floors needed mopped... that's where she belonged."}
{"text":"My second and last time at this location.  The food prep staff were ok. The cashier had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there, much less wait on customers. The food is not that spectacular either for the price."}
{"text":"Usually Cafe Rio is great.  Tonight we barely made it out with our minds.  There was such chaos ordering one person would start then leave and another person takes over not knowing what was previously said about the order.  I actually wanted a separate bag for part of the order but decided it would cause too much confusion.   Pass this place."}
{"text":"One of my very first Mexican grill spots that I really Love to eat at. The atmosphere and courteous staff are really nice."}
{"text":"I just love the food and how well the took care of me even when there was a HUGE line definitely coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Service was awful!  I've heard it was bad, but it's worse than bad.  It's awful!  Food was okay.  I had to beg for my Chips and guacamole, which I paid $4.99 for.    We can eat anywhere in Henderson and Las Vegas and be treated 100% better.  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"After trying Cafe Rio a few times. I now prefer this place over Chipotle! (They are very similar) What makes Cafe Rio stand out amongst it's competition is their sweet Barbacoa (shredded pork) it's just packed with flavor and just plain addicting! It's great in the salad or burrito. Try out the enchilda style (sauce and cheese baked on top of the burrito) when you get a burrito for a dollar more.   I've tried the steak tacos as well. Not too bad but nothing to write home about. The prices are affordable and food portions are large. All the ingredients are always fresh and prepared right in front of you.   Try out the house dressing on anything you order. As for drinks, they have a ton of selection, but since this is a Mexican restaurant, I suggest the Horchata! This location is busier than the other cafe Rios but a lot nicer inside. Be ready for a long line..."}
{"text":"Quick thoughts on a quick serve type of place that happens to be a chain (I know I know). Yes, it is in the same genre as Chipotle and Qdoba, but it has one thing they don't: a magic tortilla wheel of goodness! That's right: they churn out homemade corn tortillas right there in front of you on this magic grill that goes around in circles. Obviously, I find it quite fascinating. Maybe it is just a gimmick, but it works for me.  I went on a Saturday when they have a mahi mahi fish taco special (also something that the other two joints don't have). They were pretty tasty. On other days of the week, they have salmon tacos, which I think is a pretty special offering, but I haven't tasted them. I am on the fence regarding the rice; it is definitely flavorful, but I am not sure if it is a weird flavor or a good flavor.  I can't imagine that they do the other meats better than Chipotle, but if you are looking for a quick fish taco on a homemade corn tortilla, you might want to swing by the Rio."}
{"text":"Always love coming to cafe rio the food is excellent. Tip ask them to run your burrito through the warmer 1 1/2 times for a nice hot burito... oh ya wet that bad boy up as well perfection!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I guess the inmates run the joint because it was filthy, disorganized and the service is non-existent!!! wouldn't go back if they were giving this crap away."}
{"text":"You walk in and it has a cool little modern Mexican vibe the art on the walls is lovely and the music is perfect. Your walk in experience really gets you in the mood for some Mexican food.  It was pretty busy and they ended up losing my husbands burrito.... then when asked about it they acted as if he was lying about it... then when the man that originally made it had to make it again he acted like it was anyone but his fault.... it was upsetting because my husband was really excited to finally take me to where he always goes in Vegas and our experience was pretty MEH...  The food was ok but I'm sure had our experience in line been better it probably would have tasted better as well... good thing there's more than one in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered Through the website, it was ready by the promised time. I ordered the steak taco, the shrimp taco, and the chicken burrito. We also ordered two orders of the queso and chips. The food seems a little over priced although it is said to be all made from scratch. I definitely taste a difference in the tortillas and chips. The rice was slightly undercooked but everything else was fine. This place is good for a quick fix of Mexican food, although I'd probably honestly just hit up Rubios next time."}
{"text":"Great establishment and especially for it being a chain.  The place is clean and has a transparent kitchen allowing us patrons to know that the ingredients are in good standing. The prices are within good range and the seating makes it very convenient for groups.  I like their menu it's simple yet offers enough options to make it an agreeable spot."}
{"text":"You'll love cafe Rio. I've eaten here many many many times and it's amazing. You'll never go to another Mexican gas food again after eating here. Very high quality."}
{"text":"The service is always horrible and the food is not mexican at all.  I dont know why this company cant just use actual spanish rice.  The rice has no taste.. its fat and resembles  something youd get out of a microwaveable uncle bens pouch.. the green salsa taste like bleach and everything is dripping with water.  The one star is for the queso dip.. which is the only good thing they sell.... please fix that nasty rice it ruins everything"}
{"text":"Nothing special to brag about here. Try it for yourself it good but it doesn't beat Chipotle. I liked it."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. My family ordered the taco's, burrito and taco salad. Everything was tasty, great service and an overall great experience. My new favorite fast food place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Reliable chain for hangover food or an indulgence. The food is not authentic Mexican by any means, but no one expects it to be. The flour tortillas are scratch made on site, the food is consistent, and the service is friendly. Recommendation: sweet pork quesadillas."}
{"text":"It's good for a quick go to fast food Mexican that is not Taco Bell... I pretty much order the same think  Pork burrito enchilada style with no beans or rice. (I know so adventurous)  We also order the tortilla soup with no meat and because I am a whimp we stoped ordering the queso because sometimes it's mild enough for my paler and other times it's a little too much and I have to embarrassingly push it aside.  I have always enjoyed the deco and I rarely have a mess up on my order and when I do, the staff usually is quick to fix.  So I have to say, I have tried almost all of the plates, all pretty decent but have settled on just the one for me and my friends always get the tortilla salad or pork quesadillas and they are always accurate with the plates always being pretty spot on to what we have come to expect."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has delicious Mexican style food. Each time I come here I order the Chicken or Steak Quesadilla. However, if you're looking for bigger meat portioning I would recommend you do the Chicken Quesadilla because when I got the Steak it did not cover at least a third of my tortilla wrap. Most of my quesadilla was filled with cheese so I personally do not think you'd get your monies worth. The basic toppings that comes with the quesadilla are lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and avocado. If you want any extras or anything additional to those toppings they will charge you. When it came time to paying the cashier was a bit off, he asked what I had in my order and the girl who did the toppings already communicated it to him on my order so I had to repeat it. He didn't even place my drink cup nicely on the tray, he just tossed it on there and the outside of the cup felt sticky/ wet because he was previously bussing tables and cleaning counters before taking my payment. It was disgusting, he didn't even wash his hands. The drink bar is filled with coke product varieties and I usually get the horchata! When it comes to hot sauces if you come during dinner time the hot sauces are non-existent. There was an empty Cholula, Green Tabasco, and Tapatio bottle, and it wasn't refilled/ thrown away. The food is good but it is so frustrating that after each visit the portions vary (mostly gets smaller each time I come in) and the cashier isn't as nice as they're supposed to be. For a Steak Quesadilla I paid $11.31 and that's without my drink price. The portions aren't that big and the amount you pay does not equal to the quantity they give."}
{"text":"Worst customer fast food experience ever! I popped in at 9 p.m. on the DOT. The staff is already putting the food away. I inquired about it... I said what time do you close? Staff said we close at 11. But we want to leave early. Long story short as she scraping my rice from the bottom of the barrel. I declined my order and walked out. I ended up driving across the street to Taco Bell... I really want to give them no stars. But since I'm forced to give a star. I'll count this one star just for having the lights on in the building ... I promise I won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got very bad food poisoning from this place. We use to like it. But we don't like being that sick for three days. Good bye cafe rio."}
{"text":"So I decided I want Cafe Rio for dinner, I call my mom up ask if she can pick it up, she tells me to order online. I go to check how long it will take online and it says 45 min?? My mom says that's okay so I go to order it, it says my account doesn't exist, I click cancel and it erases my whole order. I type in my order a second time and go to get my credit card, come back to the website and would you look at that my order is gone. So I call my mom and she says she'll go in an order it. The line takes forever, like always. The guy asks her what she wants she gives him my order and moves on to the next customer, guess what, my mom wasn't done ordering. She brings it home and we start eating. To my surprise I find a piece of BEEF in my VEGAN burrito. I proceeded to throw everything I just ate up and am now writing this very salty post. DON'T EAT AT CAFE RIO"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and fresh.  I can only compare this place to Chipotle, but with more greens. The flavors are super fresh, and the combination of ingredients is fairly well put-together, and it should be because you choose them.  It might be a year before I can visit one again in Vegas, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. Staff was friendly and food is quick. I had the burrito and my husband had the enchilada plate. The burrito is huge so there was leftovers."}
{"text":"Gotta agree with Tony B. here... the taco salads are freaking awesome. I tried this place for the first time last night and it was quite crowded (a good sign!). Seemed nearly everyone was getting the taco salads.   Just so you know, this is no ordinary salad. Additionally, this is by all means NOT a healthy salad. You cannot delude yourself into thinking you are sticking to your diet at all if you order this. Despite the hefty calorie count, it's so yummy!!!  It starts with a huge homemade tortilla that has cheese melted on it. Yes, I said a tortilla with cheese is how your freaking salad starts. YUM. They pile it with your choice of pork , chicken or beef (I got chicken, fiance got pork.. both were excellent). They also serve it with rice, beans, romaine lettuce, 2 kinds of cheese, guacamole and tortilla crispy strips on top. I could barely finish half of this massive feast, but the half I did eat was quite delicious. Salad prices average ~$8 depending on what meat you pick."}
{"text":"This place was delicious for trying it for the first time when I came out to Las Vegas I will definitely have to come back when I come back. It is like chipotle but a little different and with more variety so definitely check it out if you come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is great, but this location sucks.  Everyone is grumpy, my order is never right, I am never charged correctly.  I will not even go to this location."}
{"text":"Holy hot mess every table is dirty they overcharged us but the food was decent so 1 Star it is!!! This place is filthy and I'm a bit scared but at least the kid behind the counter is a nice kid!! Did not get his name no name tag! Have to say won't be coming back here! Greasy yuck!"}
{"text":"Totally decent, fast Mexican food.  The salads and tacos are good, but recently I've been stuck on the chicken enchiladas. (Don't forget to order extra verde sauce to cover the rice.) The employees check in with you at regular intervals during the food prep process to make sure you want the added pico, lettuce and cheese, etc... (and you do!:)) I've never had anything but friendly service here, but I almost always end up at Zaba's instead when I'm craving a quick Mexican treat. Cafe Rio just doesn't always taste as fresh as I would hope for. But with the frequent dining card deals and the huge portions there's no denying it's filling food at a good price."}
{"text":"It's kind of a rip off of the Chronic Taco style \"Taco & Burrito assembly line\" but not nearly as good.  To be fair my daughter gave her steak salad 4 stars mine was terrible. The place is clean and the people are nice and offer excellent service. The quality just wasn't up to my par.  I think Friday night is Mormon night. Crawling with Missionaries and huge families with kids running wild."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, at this new location the service is not impressive.  I'm still standing in line to place my order and it's been 25-30 min.  Corporate needs to get in here and get this under control or I predict they will go out of business!!"}
{"text":"I guess when you live in Phoenix and have so many incredible choices for Mexican food you can be a little disappointed every now and then. Cafe Rio at the start was not clear with their menu. Not sure if that is on purpose or just an oversight, but you need to have a starting point for customers. I ordered a chicken burrito and was shocked at the lack of help and suggestions. I didn't know what they had for additions nor was I told.   Maybe I caught them on an off day, but I think they could do some adjusting to their menu and process."}
{"text":"Well the rice was extremely dry, the dressing was slimy, the lettuce was so big you could hardly fit it in your mouth , the food tasted stale , the tortilla was hard.   The food also made my friend sick with a very upset stomach   We normally love cafe rio but this location sucks"}
{"text":"The only good thing here is the fresh tortillas. They are SO skimpy on the cheese (if you want enough cheese to actually TASTE, you have to pay extra!), the black beans were flavorless and not fully cooked, the rice is bland. The queso is lumpy. I'm vegetarian, so I have no opinion on the meats. I tried it three different times to give it a fair shot. First time I got black bean tacos, fail. Second time I got cheese enchiladas, fail. Third time I got a vegetarian salad, fail (and they put enough lettuce on top to feed an army of rabbits. I guess lettuce is WAY cheaper than cheese). I will go out of my way to drive the extra miles to a place that cooks the food properly and has some flavor. Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"The sweet pork burrito enchilada style is a must.  However, \"assembly line\" is alway a challenge.  They always need at least 5 people working the line, but only 3-4 again tonite.  Would eat here more often if it didn't take 15-25 mins to get our food each time."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and suspected Cafe Rio was the  new Cafe Caubo which closed down a few years ago. I was right, so for all  of you who knew and loved Cafe Caubo you can find their amazing salads etc. again at Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is pretty good but it's a hit and miss when it comes to their service.  If they are really busy, you can forget about your food being made with care.  When I  go I always order their Sweet Pork Barbacoa burrito, because it contains a hint of sweet and tenderness for pork.  I always like to add lettuce, sour cream and tons of pico to my order as well.  You may also order your burrito enchilada style as well for an additional cost. They have really good  pico de gallo as well.  This time during my visit I added their Queso and Chips option, which was pretty good.  Their queso contained a hint of hot spicyness, that took affect after about 30 seconds of chewing.  Overall, Cafe Rio is a good option should you become bored with Chipolte."}
{"text":"I come here often food is always good. However just now ordered my salad. The guy behind the counter was a complete a'hole when I had to tell him (because he didn't ask) what I want on my salad. He made comments under his breath.. If you hate your job so much. Do us all a favor and quit!"}
{"text":"Highly disgusted!!!! There was a bug in my food. I noticed it right when I was going to take a bite.  My wife & I come here every so often & each time the staff is terribly rude... When I showed them the bug that was in my food they didn't even bother to apologize. They did give me a refund but, I will NEVER come back again!!! This location is terrible & the staff is not pleasant.  Only getting a one start because it won't allow me to post without grading."}
{"text":"Every single time I go to this cafe rio, I regret it. The staff is always unpleasant and the food is awful. Quesadillas with barely any cheese or the cheese not spread properly so there's a bunch in the middle, not even melted all the way, and nothing on the sides. Steak doesn't have the same taste as other cafe Rios. Soup doesn't have a good flavor either."}
{"text":"We came to try it out before shopping hungry at Frys. Everything about the service was fine but for me it was the food. Both my daughter and I ate maybe half of our food before throwing it away. Mine was really watery, hers was really greasy and both of us left not feeling too great. Maybe because we don't eat food like this is because it wasn't sitting right but I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"What is sweet, tender, and makes your stomach feel good to the bone? Yup its the pork barbacoa at Cafe Rio. Whether it be in a taco, salad, enchilada, burrito, or nacho you really cant go wrong. Flavor explosion everywhere. PERIOD!"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious and very high quality. You get your money's worth with their large quantities. Delicious & friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was great, but this place gets insanely packed.  When the wife and I walked in, we thought there was a special promotion going on, but it seems that's just the normal lines they have there.  While this is a great thing for business, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes in line to get your food, pay, and eat.  The employees were apologetic, which was nice, but most people typically go to these types of places (Chipotle, Costa Vida, etc) to have a quick and decent meal.  On the bright side, follow them on Facebook!  This location gives buy one get one free entree coupons quite often so it's worth the follow."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh ingredients & homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle, you have a whole assembly line of workers preparing your meal.  I heard this place is always crowded, always a line. They have daily specials and when I went on a Wednesday, I forgot what their special of the day was. So I order the Carne Asada on a burrito , with rice and beans ,with enchilada style. You can customize anything to your own personal liking. The burrito were just good. It was enough to get me full. Nothing outstanding. So I order the Tortilla soup that was good to my taste   The daily specials come with a drink as well. Cafe Rio recently started to put their specialty drinks out by the fountain drinks. Their strawberry lemonade, mint limeade and horchata are all available to refill for free! I personally like to mix the strawberry lemonade and the mint limeade together. It's really refreshing - a must-have for the Vegas summers.   Don't forget to get a stamp card! Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Cafe Rio is slightly above Chipotle when it comes to the freshness and quality of their ingredients. Consequently, their prices are also a little higher but I really like how consistently fresh their steak salads are. If you are health conscious like me, get the salad without chips and tortilla; that will cut down at least 600+ calories."}
{"text":"I DEFINITELY took advantage of the Buy One Burrito or Salad, get one free coupon that was floating around on Facebook for the month of March. Somewhere along the way, I became a converted fan of Cafe Rio. I say convert because I was not a fan of Cafe Rio previously. I guess all I needed to do was give Cafe Rio a second chance!  First off, the burritos and salads are huge. Bigger portions sizes make my fat girl heart happy. Second, the tortillas are freshly made. In fact, they're so fresh sometimes I have flour dust on my hands! Cafe Rio's tortillas beat out all the competition IMO.   VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($7.79): Comes with \"double\" beans and rice. I get mine with black beans with hot AND mild sauce. This location loads the burrito up with cheese. Yassss! Guacamole comes with the veggie burrito, but I pass on that. I wish they'd let me sub sour cream instead! Also, Cafe Rio's burritos are best eaten with a fork and knife. I learned that the hard way.   Price wise, Cafe Rio is a bit on the expensive side for a fast food burrito place. It's probably around $10-$12 per person, depending on how many \"extras\" you get.  UPDATE: OMG OMG Cafe Rio has the best military discount ever! 25% off your entire purchase. That's one of the biggest discounts I've come across at a fast food chain. Way to go Cafe Rio!     Worth a Return Visit? Yup.     TIP: They have Vanilla Coke on fountain drinks and horchata as well :)  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #60"}
{"text":"While the food is typically good, the customer service is simply awful. A few weeks ago, I placed an order online so that I could quickly pick it up on my way home. I arrive to pick up my food at 6:15 (exactly when I said for my order to be ready when I submitted it hours prior). There is a line for call-in/online orders. The woman at the front of the line was standing there for 10 minutes before anyone even came over to acknowledge her! Long story short, I waited for 25 minutes in line to be acknowledged and when I got to the front, they JUST started making my food. The people working the register were unorganized and not polite. Today, I tried my online order again. I showed up and they couldn't find my order in the system. I showed them the email confirmation on my phone... But that was no help. So, the manager came over and was so completely rude. I said \"so, do I need to get in line and order now?\" And she said \"Yeah I guess if you want\". Mind you, I am 8 months pregnant and my back hurts. I placed the online order to NOT have to wait in line and deal with the madness that takes place when you are trying to order more than one meal. They need to fix the mess that is this restaurant or they will be losing my business. The workers toss food all over and put ingredients in your meal before you even tell them what you do/do not want. I'll be visiting Chipotle where their staff is overly friendly and their online ordering system has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"Hands down most unauthentic Mexican slop I have ever attempted to just put straight into the garbage can.... citrus grilled chicken should just be called cardboard!!! Beyond.. the rice was hard from sitting in the steam table for far too long. What a waste of money.. also the place is disgusting so filthy and they just remodeled this place... not a place I want in my neighborhood.."}
{"text":"I typically eat here about three or four times a month. I don't normally write negative reviews but what I saw tonight prompted me to do so. This review has nothing to do about the food which is always good. It's about the customer service and the tall gentleman with the red shirt which I can only assume is the manager. He went out of his way to help the young lady just in front of me which I came to realize was either a family member or girlfriend. In short he went out of his way to help her while sacrificing other customers inline. Totally not paying attention to what people wanted which slowed up everyone's dinner. I am all about taking care of your family but not when it comes to business and customer service."}
{"text":"If you read this, you'll probably wonder why I didn't give this place 1 star.  I cannot bring myself to give any place an overall 1 star rating unless the experience is so, exceptionally horrible, that I'm still complaining about it after I've left and I'm sitting at home.   Not many places deserve one star in my book.  This one almost did, but I went in hungry and left full and forgot about it soon after I left so no 1 star here.  Plus, the staff were friendly even in the chaos and you can't ignore that. That being said, my Mexican food standards are pretty high and everyone SWORE by this place so I finally tried it.  If I'm going to suffer the plight of diarrhea, I'd at least like some flavor to make it worth it.  I truly would prefer eating frozen burritos over this place.   I'd also like to know who provided this restaurant with a single dollar sign.  I paid $12 for a soft tortilla on the bottom of my salad (what is that ish?), bland meat, the cheese they put on the salad was awkward for a Mexican salad, tasteless and sparse, topped with a side of the strangest Mexican salad dressing I've ever had and a small drink cup.   Not  only that, but I had to shout my order across the noise to the person making my order and could barely hear the questions being asked.  Normally, that sort of thing doesn't bother me with this style of  restaurant, but this was worse than a bar on a Saturday night.  Don't even get me started on the claustrophobic atmosphere.  Kids everywhere, kids screaming and kids dropping their food and crying. I'm not a kid person, but the parent to child ration was 1:3 and that could shake anyone trying to eat lunch. The tables were so close together you have to ask the guests behind you to scoot forward so you can get out.  Tables were built around the waiting line so the people in line had the pleasure of watching you eat and you had the pleasure of being uncomfortable. I could go on and on, but you get the gist of it.   Wild horses could not drag me back to this place. If I won a $500 gift certificate here, I would give it away. Okay, I might sell it to someone,but the only way I'd ever eat here again is if I were starving."}
{"text":"me and my husband had gotten off work so late and rush our way here for some late dinner and all last min too. they were ready to close but they had such great positive attitude on serving us 3 mins before closing and they even HOOKED IT UP LIKE WOW! my husband and i both work at a pizzeria and we know how food service is at times but they show us in a very odd way; even before closing, customer and service matters. i live only 5 mins away at the palisades apartment and just discover this place not even a week ago and im in love with the food and service. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAV SPOTS NOW! thank u cafe rio for uyour kind service and for that awesome little song if extra cheese :)"}
{"text":"Honestly love their food but don't understand why they never can keep an \"A\" health rating? It used to be a \"C\" and now is a \"B\" not sure if the kitchen is unsanitary but I won't be eating there until their rating is back to an \"A\". EW! Also found a rubber band with hair on it in my Fresca sauce.. This location needs some TLC."}
{"text":"My recent experience here was positive. The customer service was on par. When you go up to order you can see someone actually making fresh tortillas right there. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Very tasty. Chicken was tender and the cheese and sauce were delicious."}
{"text":"Get the sweet pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style. It's so good that I haven't ever tried anything else.   Line usually takes about 15 minutes because the place is popular. It's an assembly line and you will repeat your order to about 4 different people before you get to the cashier.  Totally annoying, but the food is worth it! Tortillas are made right there -very fresh."}
{"text":"Yikes, this location is in need of some help. I ordered food to go online and I arrived a bit earlier than the time it said it would be ready. Hey it's Monday and the Bachelor is on, I had to get home with dinner before it started! Soo I got there and the place was empty and I told the girl at the register I ordered food online but I was there a little early. The lady was so confused and said they never got an order and that she had to get the manager. I was starting to doubt myself and thought maybe I put the order in for the Sahara location. Soon the manager (I think) came out and then they finally realized yes I was there a bit earlier than it said my order would be ready but I had already explained that to them. They found my order and started working on it (keep in mind there was no line forming or anything, no one was there) Then I got my food and went home. When I got home there was no dressing or guacamole in my salad. No one likes a salad without dressing, especially at Cafe Rio because the dressing is the only reason I even order a salad. So I was a bit disappointed. This experience just was really awkward and strange. Then on top of it my order was wrong. I really prefer the Sahara location."}
{"text":"I'm truly shocked by the low rating for Cafe Rio at this location. I came here for dinner and the only negative thing was that it was incredibly busy so I had to wait in line for more than 20 minutes. The reason it has a crazy long line is because it's so delicious and everyone wants Cafe Rio! The staff was so friendly and hard working. I ordered a few other items to go for my family and the staff was never overwhelmed (which has definitely happened at the other locations, I've even got an eye roll and sigh before). This staff seemed to know what they were doing and worked great together as a team. I got a vegetarian salad and my sister got the shredded chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce. The salad is so delicious and the house dressing is to die for. It is definitely the best salad dressing I've ever tasted in my life. You really can't go wrong ordering anything here though. Cafe Rio is the best!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I've been wanting to try this place for two years. Ordered the grilled salmon tostada. Big mistake!  The salmon is chopped up and the tostada shell at the bottom was so greasy and soggy that I pulled it up and threw it in the garbage.  The rest of my salad had no flavor and I threw it away as well.  Chips were cold and had no flavor, along with the bland salsa. Only giving 2 stars b/c my husband liked the shredded pork tacos. Never going back"}
{"text":"Hours are wrong. They don't close at 11 they close at 10. It would be dope if they didn't waste my time and put accurate hours."}
{"text":"So today I ordered queso& chips with just sweet pork and a tortilla on the side to go.   When I opened up my food bag at work queso was every were. Very poorly packaged. The heavy sweet pork container was for some reason put on top of the queso causing the lid to crack and getting over absolutely everything in the bag.   There was barely any queso left. Good waist of 5+ bucks. The little bit i did get to eat was really good. The sweet pork was amazing as always. The pico de gallo and salsa very tasty and fresh.    The quality of the food is great!! the reason why I'm giving two stars is because this whole situation could have been avoided if there was someone paying attention to details and not just throwing everything into a bag."}
{"text":"This is the best Cafe Rio ever. The staff is what makes this place a true 5+ stars. Tonight right at closing where most places are like \"fuck really\" these guys were so happy to assist us. Even though I knew a little of what I wanted they let me sample almost everything and did it with a smile. Then as we are about to finish the meal they were kind enough to give us a free desesert. Amazing absolutely amazing staff. Especially the new employee George. George is gonna be the best staff member you guys have. Give him praise and a raise."}
{"text":"Their customer service is awful. Every single time. Good food but awful service. This location is always my last choice. I would go anywhere else before going here. The San Tan location is far superior when it comes to service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"So sad...such great food and this location is a mess. Took 20 minutes to order and get my food with ONE person in front of me. Lady working was unhappy to say the least, and I stood at the counter after my food was done for 3 minutes before somebody else came over to ring me up (she was busy talking to friend that came to see her). She short charged me...didn't ring up enchilada style nor the queso dip. Normally I would correct her but I wasn't about to waste my energy helping such a pathetic group of employees. There were TWO guys eating and the place was trashed. Dirty tables, napkins strewn all over the floor...  I will never go back to this location. Stephanie St. location is 100x better in every way possible.   But hey, thanks for the free queso!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Cafe Rio here, as we have been going to the one in Scottsdale. I have to say we were very disappointed. While the food tasted good, they were stingy with the portion size. We both got the chicken tostadas. While making our food, the woman gave us a ridiculously small amount of chicken. When we asked for a little more, she gave it to us, and charged us extra!  She was not friendly or polite. We will continue to drive to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cafe rio, everyone was nice and pleasant and I was enjoying my first time there until I notice the guy ran out of chicken and asked 4 times for chicken to his co worker and nobody got more chicken so me and my friend both had chicken quesadillas and as I write we are eating it and nothing but mostly cheese because they took forever to get more chicken out so he didn't even bother to add more chicken.very disappointed.. also when about to buy my friend asked for us to split it so $15 cash and $15 on my card and he just swiped the card and looked at us and said \"sorry I put it all on the card\" and before he even swiped it we told him to split the transaction and he looked confused. Everyone there looked new and didn't know what they were doing. I was so excited to try to new cafe rio but it didn't turn out well at all. Spent $30 and wasn't pleased at all for the food I just spent money on that wasn't worth $30"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night at CR, my daughters wanted cheese quesadillas and they still charge $8, dinner for all of us was $35. I will say that the food was good, but not at the price and style(this is a sit down price) As we left it reinforced how great Chipotle is. I hope not to return. Do yourself a favor and drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had cafe rio for the first time on cinco de mayo for a staff lunch. The food was disgusting and cold and  we assumed that it had been sitting their for about 2 hours. Since we asked for our take out to be ready at 12:50 and our ticket stated pick up was at 11:04. The food had good flavor, but I just couldn't get over the drenched soggy nachos and the brown guacamole. We are assuming that the day was short staffed and just a little hectic for the holiday. When we called to let the manager know she was super nice and really apologetic and gave us free meals. We will be giving them a second chance because normally the food is supposably great, and the staff handle the situation great."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they struggle with cleanliness.  There is never a place to sit because the tables are dirty and there floors are filthy.  It makes me not want to return because of the lack cleanliness."}
{"text":"Always go here for good salads and never have problems. Reason for 3 stars is due to their inability to get a to go order right. Also there is no way to claim your balance on the mobile app."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Price okay unless you want a premium meat product. Place looked clean. Decor was nice. Reminds me of a Chipotle without and organized prep line.  Rice had a bitter taste. And the beans tasted a little flat. I think I expected more based on the reviews. I'll have to come back and try something else and see if it makes a difference.  Service didn't get any better. It actually got worse.  I don't Know what my food tasted like I refused it after my food was thrown onto a tray when I told the young lady it was not to go."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  2 people $25 and you don't get very much and the flavors are nothing to write home about.  Employees friendlier and more professional than the one on Stephanie.  Think I prefer Cabo in Sunset Station or Robertos on Boulder."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch about 1pm on a Monday. They probably just had a rush for lunch because the place was a little messy. I wanted a chili beef salad with tortilla on the side. After the meat, they didn't ask me what I wanted, They rushed me through the ingredients and before I could ask for salsa they were moving my tray to the cashier, I had to ask 3 times to \"wait, can I get X on this\"? They added lettuce and cheese on my girlfriends dish and she didn't want any. Not to much concern for how we want our food they just assume they know what you want. When I asked for sour cream he took a spoon and scooped out sour cream container but the container was mixed with lettuce and salsa and whatever else got spilled in it, so it looked like a spoon of white and brown mush. At checkout I noticed a rancid smell, from my experience working in restaurants the smell was consistent with dirty old mop water. We walked to our table and the smell was still there. I found it hard to have an appetite while being overwhelmed with the smell of rotten dish rags. Anyway I started to eat and about half way through my meal I found a hair in the lettuce. I spit my food out and asked for a refund. My appetite was gone. I have had bad experiences at other cafe Rios but this was the worst. They gave me my money back which is why I gave one more star. Other times I've come in it has taken forever to get food. Last time I went there were 5 workers doing food prep and only one worker helping customers, it took 22 minutes to get through the line. Not kidding I timed it. Cafe Rio get your act together."}
{"text":"AH! I WILL NOT eat at this Cafe Rio location anymore! I just moved back to Arizona from Utah and thought Cafe Rio would be the same here, but it most definitely is not. I don't know who the hell is running this location, but I won't come back anymore for several reasons. The food is good (even though the prices are higher now and the portions are WAY smaller), but holy smokes does the customer service SUCK. It's on a whole other level of suckiness. This location has consistently gotten my orders wrong or I've called in ahead of time and my order still wasn't ready when I got there. What's the point of call ahead people? But mostly, it's just the customer service that is so bizarre. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant in all my life! I have yet to interact with a nice employee down there. It gets worse every time I go in, whether that's through the line or for pick-up.  A few weeks ago, I called in a pick-up order because I was going to have my dog in the car with me and I just wanted to quickly run in. I called ahead and they told me my order would be ready in 20 minutes. I get down there 20-25 minutes later and it's totally dead. I go pay for my order and then realize they hadn't even starting making it. So then I continued to wait as they moved with little urgency to finish my order. Like how is my order not ready when it's this slow? There's basically no point in calling ahead then!   Then today, I called in a pick-up order. I go in, pay, and pick up my food. Luckily it was ready (or so I thought) when I got there. I get to my car and realize there is NOTHING  on my tostada. Not even dressing. Just lettuce, meat, and the tortilla. So I run back and tell the girl at the register, who seems genuinely pissed at me for bringing back my order that they messed up on. She says nothing, takes my plate, throws it down the line, they put the toppings on, and hands it back to me. No sorry for the inconvenience or have a good day or anything. No words came from her mouth. It was so bizarre.   The thing is, these two instances are not the only times that I've received an incorrect order or experienced shitty customer service. They just happen to be the two instances I wanted to share today. I'd consider myself pretty nice and really patient if you happen to mess up on my order or if it's not ready the second I get there. I understand mistakes happen and timing doesn't always work out. But when it happens over and over again, or there's little urgency or rush (especially when the store is already slow), and then you're rude to me time after time, I'm sorry, but I can't give you my business anymore!  I keep thinking it will be better every time I go back and I've continued to give them chances, but I refuse to visit this location anymore. Every experience proves to be worse than the last. And it's freaking unfortunate that this location is the closest one to my house.   Point of the story, do NOT go to this location!!"}
{"text":"I normally love cafe rio. But tonight my expirience there was unpleasant. Start of I had to repeat my order 3 times before they can understand me. I didn't know how 2 cheese enchiladas seemed so difficult to understand... moving forward they didn't have the right tortillas to make the order so the girl making the tortillas unwillingly made them making them small and thick and every time she flipped the tortillas pieces of it would cut off. Making it all the way down the line seemed impossible it took us almost 30 mins to complete our order which normally takes between 5 to 10 mins max when busy.. every one was rude and they did not want to make our food I understood it was towards the end of their shift but they are still working and should be doing their job . I had to be tedious in monitoring the order to ensure it would be done right and even then it had to be redone and it had to be said more than 3 times for each item... such a horrible expirience.. at the end the food was mediocre for 2 orders paying a ridiculous price of $33.00 dollars as they charged me extra for everything .. everything tortillas chips and even and extra piece of cilantro ... what a shame this location sucks !!!"}
{"text":"I like the food at Cafe Rio. The tortillas are made fresh and the limeade is tasty. My wife is a big fan of their ice, and it is interesting for me to try their daily specials -- some of which, like the fideo and tamales, are not on the regular menu.   This is quick, choose-your-own-adventure Mexican food, so, given that expectation, you need to decide whether it is worth the time in line. There is a good chance that you may need to wait in a long line as some people take a long time to make decisions. When the place was new, the staff were just getting ramped up and they were also a bit confused.   This location is pretty new and has gone through its share of growing pains which were exacerbated by the popularity and excitement of finally having a Cafe Rio in this area. You take inexperienced staff at a new restaurant and put them in front of constant long lines of customers, some of whom have no idea how a Cafe Rio operates, and what could possibly go wrong? The long lines just get longer and people get frustrated. Wrong orders happen and things just snowball.  Fast forward a few months and things have gotten better. Sure, some of the excitement has died down, which means that the lines are not crazy any more. This also means that the staff have had a chance to catch their collective breath and receive more training and experience -- at least it seems that way to me. While not everyone is smiling and happy, I have had a mostly positive experience with the staff, especially the people at the register, who have been consistently helpful and upbeat.  I'm never going to be the person who comes here every day, but I am happy to stop in periodically since the food is pretty good. However, I probably wouldn't wait in line more than 15-20 minutes... there are plenty of other places nearby if the line is that long.   I have not tried the \"order ahead\" option, so I cannot comment on the experience there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   I'm usually not a huge fan of Mexican cuisine, but this one is definitely done with taste and health in mind!!!  The salads are out of this world and come in soft tortilla, fresh veggies/lettuce, beans, authentic cheese, cilantro and choice of dressing (cilantro lime dressing is not only healthy it is also very yummy!)  I love their steaks as these are done right and often right in front of you on the grill. They also have a customer appreciation program where they stamp a frequent buyer card and you get your 10th item free!!! Also, each receipt comes with free coupon for chips and salsa.  Everything is so fresh here it became my favorite lunch spot anytime that I work on the West side. I highly recommend this place to those who enjoy this type of food and setting.  Decor is casual and clean. Prices are good for the volume that you do receive."}
{"text":"Love this place! This location just opened right across the street from ASU. Be sure to try the sweet pork burrito!"}
{"text":"They just opened and were super busy which I was expecting so that was fine.  Staff was friendly and everyone seemed happy to be there managers were singing along with the staff and doing little chants.  The only reason I give 3 stars is because I was expecting better.  To me it is average Mexican food nothing special.  People were ranting and raving over this place and I just don't see why. They do have burritos, tacos, enchiladas, taco salads, tostadas and quesadillas.  I had gotten a burrito, maybe I need to try something else next time."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Cafe Rio before, so I went here with a couple of friends last month, and wow!  I'm definitely a fan!  I love Mexican to start with, but I really enjoyed eating here.  The vibe is cool, too - love the colorfully painted chairs/tables.  Since this location is further from where I live, I'll likely not be back to this one unless I happen to play a gig in this part of town, but I'll definitely be back to Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get some bullshit problem, I don't understand why I continue to give chances. I placed an online order and came in exactly at my pick-up time to find noone ever saw the ticket print and never prepared my order, meanwhile the couple in front of me has now ordered just about everything off the menu and almost all the meat is gone. Since they hadn't even begun to make my order I asked for black beans and rice vs the double beans I accidentally selected. If I hadn't rushed to the guy making the food it wouldn't have had either because the cashier didn't remember and would rather the order be wrong than ask me again. I also asked for NO  cilantro on my salad order and without fail there was cilantro scattered all over. I have come to this location several times and have never had a smooth ride, there have always been issues or attitude problems. This time I am done. Save yourself what time you can; speak clearly and watch them like a hawk."}
{"text":"This place is CRAZY at about 1pm on a weekday since it's right across the street from the UNLV campus. Overall it's not too bad in terms of either food or service. In fact the staff is quick, effective and polite so A+ for them. The food is reasonable... I've had their stuff a couple of times now and the barbacoa pork on anything is pretty good (you can get it in a burrito, a salad, etc.). Really on the sweet side, it seems to be a crowd favorite. Pricing is the middle of the road for \"fast\" food (service is somewhat like Subway where one person starts your order and others add stuff as you like as you make it through the line). For like $12 you can get a big buritto and a drink. If you attend UNLV like I do though and need a quick and filling lunch it's a good place to head to."}
{"text":"Really need to change the operation hours on here. I came in at 930pm tonight to be greeted with a closed shop. Yelp says 10pm til Sunday's. No biggy. Just an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Cafe rio and any location I've ever been to have all been amazing. This little utah based chain is a gem and anyone who hasn't ever tried it deserves to have their life changed for the better.  I can't even count all the times I've been here. Easily approaching 100 times if I had to guess.  The sweet pork is awesome. Put it in a salad or burrito and you can't go wrong. If you go on a monday, trust me and get the Chile rellenos. You're welcome.  The tres leches for dessert is amazing, as is the key lime pie."}
{"text":"Even when the line isn't that long, it feels like it takes forever to get through. I've never waited a reasonable amount of time on line here. The service is very good, though, once you finally get up to the counter. I love those tortillas that they make while you stand there. So good!! The fire grilled chicken is delicious and I love that they melt the cheese on my tacos before putting everything on them. Lots of drink options. Eh, I can take it or leave it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here last night for dinner. It was pretty good considering the lack of Mexican food in the area. It's a little bit more expensive then chipotle. I had the chicken tacos. The tortillas were amazing! The rice and beans were not my favorite. My boyfriend had the barbacoa and burrito. He said he didn't like it because it was sweet. So if you like sweet then it's for you. He also got it covered in red sauce and cheese. Over all he liked it but next time he will try a different meat. We also got chips, guacamole and salas. The chips were perfect and not to salty. The guac was chunky and refreshing. That salsa was good but we enjoyed the guac more. The lemonades looked so good but I didn't try them. The place was clean and has put door seating which is nice. Over all we will be back to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"Come see real life zombies make your food! Bring the whole family, but don't come hungry!!  I'm all for equal opportunity employment and glad that these zombies can have an income with Cafe Rio, but I'm disappointed in how much these \"workers\" hate their job. I understand that it's not a glamorous job, but maybe zombies can learn to smile once in awhile? Maybe they are hungry too...  Side note! I found out a few weeks ago that if you order nachos, the staff will sing! So tonight I order nachos (because NACHOS) and the girl responded very dryly, \"I'm all sung out\" and proceeded to have Zombie Boy finish our orders. The couple behind us were left high and dry while their burrito cooled down. Sad burrito.   The food is great and that's why I still go to Cafe Rio. I've been a long time customer of this place in another state (still surprised that they sing about nachos) and will still be, just not in a hurry for food.   Very disappointing... but go zombies!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place -1 star? I've already left a review but I need to add more. I have called this location and taken the customer service survey 4 times. EVERY TIME I have requested someone call me. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A CALL. I lived in Utah for over ten years and used to eat at Cafe Rio in Provo, Salt Lake City, or Bountiul at least once a week. That adds up to about $520/ year for ten years. And that's assuming I was eating alone, which I usually was not. I would drive out out of my way to go there because it was worth it to me. Since moving to Arizona where I live about 3 minutes from the Gilbert Cafe Rio, I have made fewer and fewer trips to this once-beloved establishment because the atmosphere, the service, and frankly the quality just isn't worth it. The prices keep going up though the food has not improved. Unless i am visiting Utah I will not go to this restaurant again. I'm sure the staff won't mind, I can tell they recognize me as a \"problem customer\" with my \"complicated order.\" (beans on the side.... Impossible, right?) i went from an at least weekly customer to not remembering the last time I went there... i seriously can't believe I'm saying this but Gilbert Cafe Rio, you made me really loath a restaurant I've loved and frequented for over ten years.  And I'm sure no management will contact me about this, either. Since they're obviously SO concerned with my \"valued opinion.\""}
{"text":"You know after listening to the music last nite late 60's/70's. It would be really cool if they could add some brownies to the desert menu, everyone would be feeling fine...and their profits would soar!!!"}
{"text":"Overall the quality/taste of food is good. My cripe is the staff..you could 3  customers in line ,but you will have 8 EE's just standing around doing nothing. Including the manager (s). But my biggest gripe and this not just restaurant It the entire staff speaking Spanish in front of me. I personally feel insulted.. That itw"}
{"text":"Tonight on my way home from work I decided to order from here on the app. I placed my order and it said it went through. It said it was for 7pm. I got here a little early so I thought I'd pay now. I go to the pick up line and they say they don't see my order. The girl doesn't even say let me see, just goes back to the other people in the regular line. So now I have to get in line and do my whole order over. Apparently I ignored one of the people making my the order and I said, I'm sorry I didn't mean to ignore you, and the guy gives me so much attitude. I go to pay and it's the same girl, and I get no I'm sorry, or anything. This location has terrible customer service. I work for a casino I know what good customer service is. It would've been nice if when she didn't see my order in the system to ask what I had and rung it up at the pick up register. And for when I apologized to that boy to have at least acknowledged my apology. Next time I'll just go to a location farther away with better reviews. This isn't this locations first bad review and I'm sure it won't be the last. They obviously dgaf. I'm giving one star cause the food is good."}
{"text":"Excellent home cooked fresh food made to order. Generous proportions, long line is possible, but food is excellent there's a reason the place so busy.... Eat inside or out!"}
{"text":"My first time at Cafe Rio was about three weeks ago and since then I've been here four times. I tried the pork quesadilla the first time and decided that it was too much meat.. Ha not a normal complaint. Then I tried the shredded chicken salad which I love! Every time I go here it is fresh and has just the right flavors without being weighed down. I will be back a bunch!"}
{"text":"I found this place with my dad and can't believe how good it was. I thought they only had one in Henderson so I would only eat here when I was in the area.  I love that they have daily specials. Those are really good deals. But once I tried that Chicken Tostada Salad it was over for me. I never order anything else. It is the perfect amount of chicken, cheese and beans of your choice. They pile high the fresh lettuce and top it with Pico and Sour Cream and a few Tortilla Chip Strips. The creamy dressing is my favorite.  This location is so busy. I could not believe how long the wait was. The staff was really friendly to everyone and they kept that line moving. The restaurant was also very clean and they had someone out there washing tables as soon as the guest would leave. Great location, great food!"}
{"text":"Yes-- I am addicted to Cafe Rio. When I found out there was a location not far from my house I flipped out. I thought there was only the Henderson location. I plan on becoming a regular here.  My review is pretty much the same as the other location. These places are pretty much the exact same.   I love that they have daily specials. Those are really good deals. But once I tried that Chicken Tostada Salad it was over for me. I never order anything else. It is the perfect amount of chicken, cheese and beans of your choice. They pile high the fresh lettuce and top it with Pico and Sour Cream and a few Tortilla Chip Strips. The creamy dressing is my favorite.  This location does not seem to be as busy as the Henderson location. I think the location might be bad. You will barely notice it from the street and it is also in the same shopping center as Chipotle. The staff was really friendly and helpful. The restaurant was also very clean and they had someone out there washing tables as soon as the guest would leave. Great location, great food!"}
{"text":"I came here on a first and last date with a guy....moving on.  I ordered I burrito which in my opinion was overpriced.  I also had an horchata which was small, only one size, and overpriced plus they charged me on a refill!  I doubt I will ever come back."}
{"text":"I go to Cafe Rio alone, with my entire family, with friends, with visitors, or just the baby and I.  No one is ever disappointed with their food.  The beef, chicken, and pork are all superior to any other fast-service and most sit-down Mexican restaurants.  My personal favorite has to be the pork,  Pork salad, pork tacos, pork burrito, heck I'd even eat that pork all alone on a paper plate.  IT\"S THAT GOOD!  It's sweet, tender and tasty.  When accompanied by Rio's fresh tortilla's (made right there in front of you) it's as close to perfect as you get.  However, you HAVE to leave room for the tres leches...it is deliciously drenched in that sweet milk concoction that tres leches is famous for."}
{"text":"Mexican food is never my go to cuisine. Working in a couple of Mexican restaurants has lead me to not actively seek it. I know for once it is an Asian working in the Mexican restaurant instead of the other way around. Every once in a while I do crave for it though. Today, one of my friends from work wanted to get lunch before he had to go to the airport.   I got a barbacoa salad with the vinaigrette. The option for whole wheat tortillas is a welcomed addition. I am not sure why a salad comes with it. Just seems like a huge open face burrito now. I like how they load up with cilantro, lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, and even give a slice of lime. What I listed only comprises half of the ingredients available. They have monterey jack, cheddar and cojita cheese, and tortilla strips.   This is a perfect meal for two or for one broke college student."}
{"text":"Barbacoa is the way to go. Have it in tacos, burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, enchiladas or a salad. Whatever it is, barbacoa should be the choice. The fact that it is noted for winning awards initially caught my interest, but after tasting it I cannot stop ordering just this protein.  This location is the busiest out of all the them. Every time I come, I am left waiting in line for 10-15 minutes. The employees manning the line are quick and efficient, but there is only so much a person can do while waiting for grill room to free up.  Regardless of minor inconveniences, I do enjoy their food from time to time."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with Café Rio, besides the staff being a tad slow and easily distracted. But they are usually nice and helpful. I've never eaten in at this location, only ordered to go. they have gotten my order correct every time which is a plus. My typical orders are Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tostada, or Tacos, and always Chips and Queso. There is always a ton of meat. I usually have left overs for another meal. I love the Creamy House dressing that they use for the salad, even if I don't get anything with veggies I still order some and dip my chips in it. So Yummy! Parking lot is small and busy...if a line forms to order, you may be waiting a bit but you can order online and skip to the cashier! Prices are decent. I don't feel like I'm eating garbage."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and it was not super busy, which was a plus. I decided to eat a burrito enchilada style with grilled chicken. One of the best burritos ever! The size was just as big as Chipotle's burrito, but it tastes more authentic.  The service was just as good too. While eating, one of the employees made sure I was doing alright, which is not something I'm used to eating at a fast food/quick service place. Also, seeing the manager working with his other employees up front in the serving station shows a lot about how much the company cares for their employees and customers. This location is also good because it is right next to a Yogurtland to fulfill my sweet craving. Overall, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite food from this place is probably the salad bowl. Don't underestimate before you even try it! Their salad bowl has rice, beans, choice of meat, lettuce, guac, and hand made tortilla! Don't forget to ask for the house dressing aka the green sauce haha"}
{"text":"Horrible. The moment I walked in it was non welcoming. No hello nor a hi. Once u walk in you see it's so dirty. They act of cleaning up as they go is unheard of. The waitress has so much attitude that needs to be checked immediately. Service was horrible and food is mediocre. NEVER AGAIN. I rather have Tacobell that is right down the st."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food here. Especially the burrito with habanero sauce. Also I didn't know until recently they provide a discount for military and first responders. Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"This Place is great!! I first had the plessure of eating at the ORIGINAL Cafe Rio in St. George, Ut. in 1997 or 1998, from the day it opened until I moved. When I saw one had opened here in Phoenix, I was pleasntly surprised. They have the same GREAT menu and a Tomatillo Avacado RANCH sauce that is truly the best sauce you will ever taste!! GET out to GILBERT and enjoy the best, most fresh MEXICAN food in the VALLEY.."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's just as good as any other Cafe Rio plus many times they've given me a bunch of extra stamps on my card. I come here all the time never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Terrible management. My taco was wet. The girl (Jasmin)putting the lettuce on was slapping soaked lettuce on several orders. As I was complaining another woman was complaining. The girl who checked me out asked if I wanted to redeem on my app I told her no. Too late she already redeemed. When I took the taco back I was told I can't get my points back. The manager On dutyJerry did not have control of the restraunt. He offered to put my name in a book for credit. What do you think the chances are that will work? I declined. Now I'm out my points and I went to Port of Subs."}
{"text":"I have to say that I dont understand the interest in this place. Went with a friend who described it as her favorite Mexican restaurant. I love my friends, but I would say that calling this place a Mexican restaurant is a stretch.   First, the atmosphere was horrible. Like Chipotle, you wait in a cattle line with a ton of other people and have questions screamed at you over the loud kitchen noise. \"MEAT?\" \"CHEESE?\" \"MILD, MEDIUM, HOT?\". Then you are shuffled into a loud, busy seating area. I just did not find any of this enjoyable.   Second, the food. I would have to say the popular sweet pork is one of the worst things I have ever tasted. It is WAY too sugary. I guess it is designed for an American palate, but I have never tasted anything like that at a true Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally visited the Cafe Rio by my house after so many visits to the one close to work. This restaurant is equally gratifying. The bbq pork burrito is one of my faves served enchilada style with the green sauce! It's like bbq sauce and pulled pork inside a tortilla. The salmon tacos are delectable as well.  It's a fast convenient lunch if you're in the area, they may get busy but the service is fast paced and efficient."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to this branch and I had high hopes since everyone said this place was better than chipotle. I haven't even tried the food yet but the service I got was so bad that I'm probably not going to go back to this location ever again. A boy worker was so quick to help me but rushed my order that he broke the tortilla twice. On top of that, he sloppily put my meat and rice that he put in the tortilla he tore off in the new tortilla and just made me not want my burrito anymore. Then, he even asked me if I wanted enchilada style but proceeded to put my burrito in the salamander without any of the sauce and cheese. Fortunately, a girl took over and looked very annoyed with him with how he dealt with my order. She was very nice and very polite. I wouldn't go back to this branch again and you should re-evaluate that worker, since he looks like he's not the best all around worker you have, and probably hire more dependable workers next time you guys are hiring."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at this place and I am unimpressed...I went in for some nachos and the line was extremely long, they ran out of pico de gallo, and their chicken was tasteless and too chewy...I'll stick to chipotle"}
{"text":"Do I have to come on a slow day to get good customer service? Came in after a 14 hour shift looking for the excitement I'm used to and got zero, borderline rude."}
{"text":"Where do I begin I grow up in Tucson AZ where you can find some of the most authentic Mexican food due to the fact it's so close to the border of Mexico So I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in my life. So when I went to Café Rio And I got the enchiladas it comes in a Pie pan which was OK. I did not really enjoy the quality of food at all it was almost as if somebody that had never tried Mexican food real authentic Mexican food created their menu and on top of that when I went into the store it was not inviting the staff weren't very friendly and the whole place is kind of disorganized and chaotic on the assembly line so for this I would not recommend going here I had an overall bad experience and did not enjoy it"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I have only gone once when the line was long and I felt them taking orders so far down the line was wrong. We had not even gotten to the tortilla making station and it sounded as though people were shouting. Overall the food is yummy and they are quick for takeout."}
{"text":"I really thought this would be a great place to eat, but I was really disappointed ! Got there at 11:30 am place was super busy! Really wanted a beef burrito, went to order . No beef?! Really it's the beginning of your lunch rush and no beef ? Only 2 options chicken or pork. Went with the pork. The presentation was great it looks fresh . But the inside including the pork was cold! Bland flavor ! 2 people cost 24.00! Wish I'd gone to Del Taco! Won't go there again !"}
{"text":"Even though this location is always super busy, I have never once had an issue. The facility is clean and they move people along the line quickly. The taste is always the same, which is delicious. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Anytime I come to this location I receive less than stellar service.   Don't come within an hour and a half up to 2 hours of closing or all of the drinks are gone except for the soda fountain. They pack that up the sofa fountain about an hour before closing. Many of the ingredients will be packed up or completely out as well even though they're open for another 1-2 hours.   They don't have lemons for the iced tea and chips often aren't ready. I asked for very light lettuce and she put 3 tong fulls on there and I had to later throw away half of the lettuce. When I stated that was way too much, she just stared at me and went on to the next thing.   Another time I placed an order online and when I showed up they had the wrong dressing. I advised them it was the wrong dressing and they argued with me and stated that I had put down the wrong one and I needed to make sure I put the right one down. When I again advised that I did put the correct one down, they argued a bit more with me and finally looked at the receipt and realized their error.  On another trip they tried 3 different times to charge me for the wrong item.   There's always employees just standing around doing nothing while patrons just wait. I emailed corporate and got no response.  I know a lot of people state they have no issues, but I've visited this location maybe 5 times and have had issues every single time."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is one of my favorite places to eat American-Mexican food. So happy that they build one closer to home. Don't understand all the haters. This place is the bomb."}
{"text":"I really like this location. I've always had very friendly service here and the dining room area is much larger than the location near my house in the NW. The salad is what it's all about for me. I go for the grilled chicken. For a $1-$2 more it's a worthy upgrade and helps keep the salad drier. Which is a a good thing because the shredded chicken can leave the salad a little wet. Also, no matter what you order, get the house dressing! It's this mildly spice cilantro ranch concoction that's insanely addicting. The food is big and I always have leftovers. My Bf on the other hand killed his salad in under 10 minutes. Oh and kids under 6, I think, can get a free cheese quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst service ever from the serving staff period tonight. Starting from put little beans in my Husbands Burrito from the young lady whose name starts with a D on the register. When I asked to speak to the manager he came out slightly apologized for her and while we were talking she was in the background laughing telling the other girls about the encounter we had just had.Altho the manager said he'd have a few words with her I doubted that after he offered to print out another survey receipt but then stated it prints randomly(so why offer) might I add I've been going to this location for over 6yrs and am sad to say I love the food but their evening staff of young adults suck as a whole."}
{"text":"Food was OK, maybe a little too greasy. Worst part was they had the music at 130 decibels so people had to yell to hear each other. I don't understand why they would do that. It was obviously way too loud."}
{"text":"Want be treated like a second class citizen ? This is your place , the big fat dude taking the over must hates his job and life with passion. I experienced better services at DMV. And food is pricy for what it is."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place since one opened near my house and was pleasantly surprised.  It's very similar to costa vida but cafe rio gives you more meat and the flavors are more bold.  I had the steak burrito and thought it was a bit pricy st $11. But I guess that what happens when you raise the minimum wage.  Nevertheless it was a damn fine burrito drenched in a rich red pepper sauce.  I actually struggled to finish the burrito which is unusual for my robust appetite."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Cafe Rio's, especially since it's so close to school. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. Once, a group of my friends and I sat in the restaurant for 3+ hours as we collaborated on a project, and the staff was nothing but pleasant. The food is always fresh, and I have yet to have a meal here I didn't enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is usually busy, and it's definitely for a reason! The taco salad is amazing- I usually get that or 3 tacos. My favorite meat is the shredded chicken, and their creamy dressing is the best! It's slightly spicy, and completely delicious! They've messed up my order once, but when I came back, they gave me the missing item for free. I have tried the sweet pork barbacoa- it is sweet, so if you don't like sweet BBQ sauce, avoid it. A lot of my friends really like it though... The food is very fresh, and really good!"}
{"text":"I love me some cafe rio. But this place is still pretty new and their workers I think are still getting the hang of it. The food was mediocre and I could tell that the workers were really stressing/rushing to get through the line. So it may be more of a training thing. I'll definitely go back again soon to check it out because I love cafe rio."}
{"text":"my husband recommended the salad and i have to say ill be here often now that  i live near here, i'll make sure we go here for lunch at some point. The location is cleaned, the food portions are amazing and the salad is so filling and the tortillas are my favorite! I will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately half the \"deliciousness\" of the food can come from the customer experience when ordering.  If they suck, food seems to suck.  I've visited 3 times since moving to this side of town and I can't seem to figure out why I didn't enjoy my meal.  After reading reviews I agree that the workers are hurried, make plenty mistakes, and are just miserable.  Except for maybe the girl at check out.    I ordered a salad, kids meal quesadilla, and the free nino quesadilla (for kids under 6).  At checkout I was confirming the order with the cashier and the veggie lady was obviously listening in.  When I said kids meal she jumped in, all defensive and told the cashier \"no she ordered THE BIG quesadilla.\" I shrugged her and her attitude off and just told them I wanted the kids one.  She went to remake it, made us pay, then wait for the kids meal, with a one year old in tow.  Geez, calm down lady.  I wonder if they recycled the perfectly good BIG quesadilla that was customized to my liking.  Either they threw it away or they mess up on purpose so they can save it for lunch :P:P:P:P"}
{"text":"Drive a couple extra minutes and go to Stephanie or Eastern.  We went there on Friday 10/17 around 8 PM. From the time we walked in, all the employees were scrambling around doing their side work to close up shop even though they closed two hours later. The young woman behind the counter making our food could not hear us multiple times, which is fine, but at least have a little common courtesy. The word \"what?\" came out of her mouth about 16 times throughout the time we ordered. She was unfamiliar with the menu and how to prepare the food. She turned my daughter's quesadilla into what looked like pile of regurgitated cheese, chicken, and flour tortilla.   They said they had no steak for my burrito and I was not told they were making more or more was on its way. I doubt they ran out that early on a Friday night and I'm sure they were just simply too lazy to cook more. When we checked out, the girl at the register tried to charge us for two extra sides of chicken which were never ordered.  Inside and outside, the place looked a like a tornado tore through. Three of the tables still had trays with trash from previous guests that were there before. Both trash cans outside were overfilled with trash with some trash on the ground.  It wasn't a good experience for my family at all and I don't think it will change anytime soon. I'm going to Stephanie next time and recommend you go to another location also."}
{"text":"Not impressed with their tacos, meat taste bland, shredded pork meat way too sweet and there salsa is not hot enough. The tortillas still had a nice flavor and thickness to them and made fresh, but the ingredients could've tasted better.  They advertise this place as a Mexican restaurant, but it really isn't lol!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I LOVE the chips and queso. I always get a side of chicken and the chips and queso and make it my meal. Its insane. Writing about it makes me want to go and get some right this second.  The people there are incredibly nice. Overall, its a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner. Found most of staff just sitting around eating. Had never been here before so we didn't know the routine. No one greeted us so we had no clue. Finally got the food started. Very very sloppy. The staff was waiting for us to say something as we were waiting for them to guide us. We'd go back if the service was better."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Cafe Rio! I've eaten here over 100 times and every time I'm delighted. I can never go wrong with either the pork or shredded chicken salad. This is one of the only places that my whole family can agree on and all be delicious. I love everything about it. The location at Horizon Ridge and Horizon is lacking service, but this one seems to get everything in check."}
{"text":"Soooo slow. I stopped at this location for a fundraiser, no one else in line, but it took forever. The manager told the girl doing my order she could go home, in the middle of taking my order. He finished preparing my salad and when I then asked him for tortilla soup, I was told I was supposed to order that at the other end of the counter. Ummm, you sent the person home, is the air going to take my order? The guacamole was dark green and at the end of the container, but that's what I got. This place is going to be a nightmare later when more people show up for dinner for the fundraiser."}
{"text":"Waited for 20mins on grill chicken , my friend finish his meal and the chicken was never ready , I was told it would take like 10mins . I got up after 10mins and told me another 5mins . I waited and nothin . I left across the street to aloha kitchen . Friendlier people and cleaner restaurant . Very disappointed , I was looking forward for my chicken salad ."}
{"text":"Too lazy to go anywhere nice. We decided to give this a try. It's like Chipotle only way better. I had grilled steak salad and it was fantastic. It came in a tortilla bowl, which normally I would never eat. But it was baked and not fried. Delicious and fresh! Picky husband had a chicken burrito and I was scared he was going to eat the pan. Amazingly, everyone working there was a good actor or actually enjoys their job. The only negative was I hate seeing all those tinfoil pans going in the trash. They should get real pie pans and wash them. On my wish list I wish they had margaritas."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Cafe Rio several times for the past 3 months. In general my observations are..   Pros:  Generous portions, fresh tasty food.  Cons:   Can be pricy (let's remember this is still fast food), about $10 for a 3 taco steak order and no drink, you be the judge.  Consistently rude staff at the food assembly line (see other reviews)  Food although fresh, tends to be soggy and messy, and generally looks terrible.  Not sure how clean this place is, as I've seen dirty tables and cross contamination when staff refills and prepares the food.  Rude staff (I know I mentioned this but I must reiterate)   Anyhow, ultimately I'm dissatisfied with this Cafe Rio location and I wouldn't recommend going.   However, if you don't mind the rude staff that gives you plenty of condescending looks just because you take more than 2 seconds to decide between pinto or black beans, then go for it.    The last time I checked, we were the customers and that used to mean something."}
{"text":"I ordered on-line and tried to use the coupon for $2.00 off (which did not work).  In any case, I placed an order for grilled steak salad with double pinto beans.  There was nearly an entire head of romaine lettuce first off al and then literally there was one small spoon of beans and one small spoon of grilled steak.  And then to top if all off, the lid was not on securely and spilled out.  All of this for $12.00"}
{"text":"We usually come to this location all time they had a new crew and it seemed like they didn't care about interacting with their customer. It's like your dealing with robots in an assembly line rather than a restaurant experience. I felt they didn't put enough meat on my salad and I asked for more and the guy cussed in the process and threw some more meat on it and said its gonna be an extra charge for that. And in the process he got chicken all over the counter from just rushing. And then the girl who was making us the Queso she just dipped the ladle in without stirring with a thick film on top and got the Queso all over the container without wiping it. I also notice that they are not very well trained in food handling or they just simply don't care. It's so dissapointing and we love this place but why is the food and experience inconsistent? We just want good food and service."}
{"text":"I love to get the salad bowl with chicken. So yummy and to top it off they have amazing desert that I think is called dolce leches. Forgive me is I have that wrong but it is topped with strawberries and whipped cream if you want. absolutely mouth watering amazing. They are always up beat and it's always been a great environment when I go in."}
{"text":"Dont bother with cafe rio.  ordered catering for our sons engagement party what a fiasco. will never waste money on cafe rio again. first and last time. will go back to costa vida for our party needs from here on out. both the local  and the corporate operations  need lessons in customer service. none had empathy or gave a crap about the fact that they messed up a large order for 50 people and left my guest waiting for an additional 45 minutes for their incompetence.   run far far from this restsurant"}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio needs to get their crap together. It's like every person behind the counter is just wandering or slowly doing something besides helping the customers. Only one person making meals. Line is so long on a Thursday night. Not prepared with enough tortillas or other ingredients on hand. Really needs to step it up. Saving grace is that the food is delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fast Mexican food.  The ingredients taste fresh and the service is always great.  The green chile pork tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"for the price this mexican food is fast and on point"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place for a quick burrito or quesadilla. The shredded pork is my go to meat here and the tortillas are delicious and fluffy not like the typical tortillas. Service is great but can be slow so I usually place an online order which is quick and convenient."}
{"text":"I give one star for a recommendation we were given by one of their employees to try the chicken and the gal at the cash register for knocking off a few bucks for the hasstle we had.  So excited this opened in a spot in the Vons plaza that has sat vacant since Starbucks came and went.  We almost walked out seeing the line but since the food is so good we decided to stay and wait and wait and wait for 20 minutes.  My husband is a steak kind of guy and after waiting we were told sorry we are out of steak.  I said for him to check with his manager and was told it would be another 20 minutes before it was ready.  What was interesting everyone was at their posts but the grill often times was left unattended. You should never run out of steak - come on.  So, here we are stuck if we didn't wait long we would have walked out.  We complained and then suggested they let everyone know in line.  It looked like to me there were not enough workers and no management on site.  I think undercover boss needs to come in and check this place out.  I will say we liked what we got all fresh food but after waiting and being hungry you are really eating so fast not enjoying the food.  Please get more help here."}
{"text":"The staff here just doesn't care at all. I cut my hand on something sharp on the door handle. I explained it to the staff, just so they could look at it and it wouldn't happen to anyone else and he told me \"oh well, things happen\". I didn't want anything just nobody else to get cut as well. Food is typical for low level Mexican place, nothing special."}
{"text":"Horrible service at this location AGAIN. The guy made my order wrong because he was too busy talking with his friends in front of me in line and then ARGUED with me when I corrected him on my order, as if he wanted me to take something I didn't order because he had slapped it in the bowl! He was rude to my teenager as well. When I made a complaint to the manager about his attitude and him allowing his friends toddler to STAND ON THE COUNTER AND HANG HER HEAD OVER THE FOOD, her response was, \"well I've never had a complaint about him yet\". As much as I love Cafe Rio, we won't spend our money at this location again. 3 visits here and horrible service all 3 times."}
{"text":"The only convenient thing about this cafe rio is the location. The food is always so sloppy and thrown together and the workers are very nasty and rude"}
{"text":"Let me just say, I love cafe rio. Order all the time. Today, I went into the one on Maryland and I never seen more rudeness than I did today. As I watched one of the workers ask Sonya for help, she basically said no ask someone else. While Sonya was saying no to help one of her fellow employees out, I watched as she rolled up silverware for a catering order. 1. She has no gloves on, 2. She was coughing all over the utensils. I feel so bad for who Evers catering order she was taken care of. Once again, Sonya was asked for help and she yet again said no. I felt horrible for the woman asking for help. I will not be returning to that location."}
{"text":"I will never go back after the way the manager treated me. She made my green salsa burrito with no green salsa ,really? After i asked the cashier if there was a reason why she didn't put the salsa on. The cashier asked her and she rolled her eyes and made a horrible face until she saw I was looking at her. Then she got defensive came up to me yelling saying she is the manager what my problem was?! Omg like I was throwing a fight? I was just wondering. Never Mind. And if she is the manager yeah well never will be back and tell my friends and family to never visit that place where they treat customers like that."}
{"text":"One my favorite Mexican fast food. Good price, friendly service, fresh tortilla, even the lemonade is fresh squeezed :) New Port Beach was the one closet location from what i life but its tottaly qorth the drive. Now we were in Gilbert, AZ and thoughts of trying. Still the same goodness of it. Barbacoa Pork and Queso were our family fav!"}
{"text":"Today at lunch I had the chicken tostada and it was great. I got it this green tomatillo ranch that was great. This place is a great spot for tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. The only knock I had was that it seems they are a little skimpy on the meat and heavy on the beans.  They make their tortillas from scratch in 3 varieties. For dessert I also got this amazing coconut caramel flan I totally recommend it if your a coconut fan.    If you haven't been here yet make the trip it's worth it."}
{"text":"This isn't authentic Mexican food, but it is very fresh and pretty good. The beans are excellent and their sauces are great. The food is made right in front of you, which is awesome, but the lines can get very long and when they do, if you have a plate going through the oven to warm, it might come out half warmed up. A few times this has happened with my cheese enchiladas, with the cheese inside being only half melted and the rest still cold shreds. It's pretty pricey for what you get, but they do have a punch card for every ten meals you buy you get one free thing."}
{"text":"FOR ANYONE THAT SUPPORTS BLUE.  Last night my husband and his partner stopped for dinner (in uniform) at the Cafe Rio on S. Durango just south of the 215 at about 8:00 pm. They ordered their food without incident, but when it got to the prep portion of the line, the young black male refused to finish their order. Literally refused. He put his hands on the counter and put his head down-and refused to look at them. He let their food sit on the grill, burning. A manager had to walk up from the back and yell at him, he ignored his manager, and the manager had to finish it while he just stood there. I'm so disgusted. Cafe Rio has always had a great reputation for being Metro friendly! As much as I don't wish for anyone's job to be in jeopardy over this, something needs to be done. My suggestion is that we inundate that location with officers in uniform.   Posted by family member of a police officer on Facebook, I think Cafe Rio will understand if I never bring my family to their place of business."}
{"text":"Not that anybody would ever care from this company. But you're losing lots of customers from what I'm reading on the reviews for the same thing I'm upset about. Ask for a little pinch of cheese on my salad and they wanted to charge me a dollar. A pinch of cheese that it! $1!! I also usually get my kids and I soda chips and salsa but not after this company wanted to charge me a dollar for a pinch of cheese. I don't think I'll ever be back again. Sorry but you lost a customer and her kids and we do eat out quite often. So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I saw my chicken tacos in a whole other light yesterday. Thank you for the food poisoning. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently close but always takes 3 times longer than it should be to get food. Disorganized line and messy work stations. Mess up the order every time. So, switch to the online order, a literal line by line list, and go to pick up the order, missing an entire entree and screwed up the sides."}
{"text":"I have coworkers who swear by this place but I honestly cannot stand it. I thought that something was wrong with me and I wasn't giving it a fair chance, so I went with them at least six or seven times. Not a fan.  I am a vegetarian and it's not their fault that I have a limited selection, but the selections I have chosen just weren't up to par. The tostada special on Wednesday is just not impressive at all, though my coworkers love it. I think both sauces they offer are disgusting and the overall taste is just...bleh. So I decided to try the cheese quesadilla two times.....bleh. It was undercooked and greasy!   Lastly, the place is just too damn loud! The employees are always yelling something when someone orders extra this or extra that. I can barely participate in the conversations my coworkers are having because I can't hear over the noise.  Don't get me wrong, they must be doing something right, because that place is always jam packed when we come in during lunch hour and my coworkers LOVE it! It's just not my bag. The food isn't as good as people say it is. I'd rather go to Qdoba, in which I find is it's closest comparison. Can't compare to Chipotle nor Zabas as I find they are way different as far as taste and selection. Bon apetite!"}
{"text":"True fact. Since I discovered Cafe Rio, probably 95% of the burritos I've eaten have come from here.  They make Mission-style burritos here, with savory beans, cilantro lime rice (that is inexplicably beige), sauce and cheese on the inside along with your meat of choice, and lettuce and pico next to it in an aluminum tray. I almost always get the shredded, braised chicken and the hot red sauce. Unlike Chipotle's rubbery, greasy meat, the chicken and roast chile beef here are flavorful without overpowering the other flavors in the burrito. The aroma of the red sauce is intoxicating.  They run the burritos through a conveyor oven and then add veggies - a \"why didn't anyone think of it sooner\" innovation that keeps hot stuff hot and cold stuff cold. Hey, remember the McDLT? Nah, me neither.  Though the salsa fresca served here isn't anything special, their \"wall of flame\" covered in hot sauces is a great way to add heat and flavor.  Honestly? The best part of this burrito is the tortilla. Made fresh moments before you order, it's dense and mild and almost more reminiscent of a naan in some bites.  Service is generally very good here, and the staff definitely seems to have a cordial rapport with their guests. Some of the quirky chants I could do without, but it makes the place livelier than your usual burrito assembly line.  Me gusta."}
{"text":"Living a matter of Minutes from this place and hearing so many good things has had me curious for Oh so long. Finally it was a hot evening and we had somehow switch the air off and the house was boiling so there was no way we were going to turn on the stove so we headed out to Cafe Rio... For some odd reason I was like a Giddy little kid who had been told all about Disney land all winter and finally summer had come! I was Ready to get my Pork Barbacoa Ears........ Yep I said it!   I ended up ordering the pork barbacoa Nachos, these things were nothing less than huge and delicious. While I was ordering mine they through together a free kids quesadilla meal for my daughter...  I have to say, I personally feel like the hype of this place is justified and the food was excellent. For those hot nights when you do not want to turn the oven on this is definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We had won a lunch at work, and my recommendation was Cafe Rio.  We went to this one the other day.  First time at this particular one.  We had a group of about 16 and found a nice section of tables we could push together (this Cafe Rio is pretty large compared to other ones).  We all got in line to place our orders and I went with my usual....Nachos!   One thing I noticed that was different at this Cafe Rio was the fact they put the beans on the chips before they put the cheese on, and before they send it through the conveyor belt oven.  All the other times I have been, they go with chips, cheese, through the oven, then add the beans, sour cream, guacamole, pico etc.  I noticed because of the way they did this, my nachos got soggy a little bit faster (all other places put the cheese on first, which melts and kind of acts as a barrier for the wet beans....chips are crispy and crunchy all the way down this way) and I didn't enjoy them as much.  Still a mighty fine plate of nachos, but the other Cafe Rio's in town are better and I prefer their layering technique.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their lunch (except for 2 coworkers who got queso cheese on their nachos instead of shredded....they didn't like it at all!) and I think I converted some folks to new Cafe Rio fans!  I don't think I will come back to this specific one again (other ones are closer to my home and even work) but if I was in this shopping plaza and needed some nachos, this is my spot.  It was a good team outing!"}
{"text":"I only get one thing here.......The Nachos!  I don't desire to try anything else, and I doubt that anything else would taste as good!  These nachos are fucking perfect!  My buddy introduced me to Cafe Rio out in CA a few years back, and ever since then, I have been addicted to their pork nachos.  Haven't found any better, and I don't think I will!    I saw that this Cafe Rio was opened within the last few months, and I decided to drive down here to check them out.  When a nacho craving hits, one must fulfill that craving...stat!  I signed up for their eclub/app and was given a $5.00 off coupon.  Score!  I pulled up to the place, parked, and walked in.  I ordered my nachos (they didn't sing the \"nacho, nacho, man\" song like at other Cafe Rios, but that was ok...always felt it was a bit corny anyways).  The guy I placed my order with was very friendly, as was the lady who made my nachos after they exited the conveyor belt.  I was wearing my St. Louis hat, and she asked if I had watched the All Star game etc.  Real personable and I am always happy when someone wants to talk sports.  I scanned my QR code on my phone, and my total came out to just under $5.00.  Score!   I took these bad boys out to my car and dug in.  Here is how they were.................  Pork Nachos-  First of all, I would like to give props to their \"to go\" packaging.  They use lids that are incredibly tall.  It provides maximum protection for your nachos, and keeps them looking beautiful.  A lot of places just slap a flat lid on your stuff, and when you open them up, you remove cheese and sour cream etc etc.  Not here....probably the best to go lids I have ever seen.  Good job, Cafe Rio!  Anyways...........back to the food!  The pork that they use is marinated in Dr. Pepper.  It provides a super sweet taste and a nice tender pork.  I have talked to folks that think it is \"too sweet\", but I think its perfect.  These nachos come loaded with pork, shredded cheese, choice of beans (I chose black), pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole.  Everything in these nachos works well with each other!  Plenty of meat, lots of cheese, a nice sized dollop of sour cream and guacamole, and a perfect amount of beans.  I am not the biggest bean fan, but Cafe Rios black beans are delicious! All of these things are piled onto some excellent chips!  That is one of the keys to a perfect nacho.  Can't have chips that get soggy and don't hold up to all these toppings.  Cafe Rios chips are perfect!  I mowed these things down while sitting in my car listening to some tunes.  I was sad when my tin was empty.    Will I be back?  Yes indeed!  Service was friendly, prices are fair and the combo of flavors of those nachos are second to none!  Simply the best!  Wish they would build one of these in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio's are popping up all over the place, and that is a GOOD thing!  I ate at the Avondale one yesterday, and wanted round two, today.  Decided to come check out this one since it was somewhat close to Surprise, and it was on my way to another place I was going.  I met my buddy here for lunch and we walked inside.  About that...........  Right when we got inside, we noticed it was hot as FUCK!  Like muggy, humid, AC broken type hot.  Definitely not normal.  I was sweating while waiting in line.  There was a huge line, too!  Peak lunch time, so it was understandable, but due to how hot it was inside the place, it made waiting in line seem longer than it actually was.    I got up to the counter and did something I swore I would never do......strayed from my tried and trued favorite, the sweet pork nachos!  Tim, how could you?  Well...I wanted to try something else so I went with their habanero hatch chile pork nachos today.  The ladies making my nachos were friendly and efficient and they hooked it up with a ton of pork and the other usual toppings.  It was so hooked up that they had to smash down my nachos so that they could fit through the conveyor belt.  I paid the lady my money, got my drink (also mentioned how damn hot it was in the place, and they agreed....not sure they did anything about it, but at least they acknowledged it was hot!) and took my nachos outside to eat!  Yes, it was about 95 outside, but it was still more comfortable than inside.  Yeah, it was that bad!  Anyways, here are how the nachos were...............  Habanero Green Chile Pork Nachos-  I have said it before, and I will say it again.....Cafe Rio nachos are simply the best nachos I have ever had.  They use great chips, that hold up even when they get a tad soggy, they hooked up the pork today with a whole bunch of scoops of it, all layered perfectly, then hit it with their habanero salsa.  They hooked up the black beans, a nice scoop of guacamole and sour cream as well as their incredibly fresh pico de gallo.  A perfect plate of nachos! The habanero pork tasted great, but it was not \"hot\" at all.  A little bit of spice, but nowhere close to normal habanero heat.  Everything worked well together, though.  Another 5 star order of nachos!  Service and food were great!  5 stars.  The sole reason for 4 stars for now was the damn temperature inside the place.  I don't really like to complain, and I sound like a broken record complaining about it,  but this shit was brutal!  I don't know how the workers behind the grills/stoves were able to manage.  They better get that A/C fixed, or drop that temperature by 10 degrees, or else people are going to flat out pass out in line.  Dead serious....a few people behind us decided to bail because of the long line and how uncomfortably hot it was in there.    I'll report back in the next few weeks to see if that issue has been fixed.  Hopefully it was just a one off and the next time I go, it will be more comfortable.  If so, this is the closest one to my house, and I will be back often!  Those Nachos are bomb!  Update 9/9/17. Have been back 3-4 times since this first review and the A/C was just messed up that one day.  Every visit since then has been awesome!  Great staff, great food.  Love this place!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love cafe rio! Everything is delicious,  although my favorite is the salad with sweet barbacoa pork. It's huge enough to share which I usually do with my daughter. Comes with choice of 2 dressings creamy avocado or cilantro lime vinaigrette.  Yum!  Fresh tortillas made right on site and so delicious!  Service is fast and love that this location has outdoor seating and lots of seating in general."}
{"text":"I love this chain restaurant.  My favorite item is the sweet pork barbacoa salad. It's a huge salad that I usually share.. It's made with a huge fresh made flour tortilla that's placed in a takeout tin bowl. They add the cheese and put it in the rolling oven. Then place the meat ,beans of your choice,black or pinto. I usually get pinto, and on occasion get the black. Rice ,lettuce and sides of guacamole,sour cream,and Pico de gallo are added. Of course you can get all or none, but I usually get everything, because I like things in my salad. you get a choice of 2 dressings which is a cilantro lime vinaigrette or the house which is a creamy avocado. Both are excellent but the vinaigrette flavor just so stays on my taste buds.  They have daily specials which is a good price because it comes with a drink.the day I went it was the  chicken tostada salad which is similar to the pork salad except it's on a corn tortilla. But since they ask what meat you want, I like to get the pork always. I have tried the beefs and chicken, but the pork is my fave.  I'm not sure why this location has low ratings. Everytime I've been, it fast and workers are customer friebdly. There is always a line, and I guess I always get there just in time, because the line after me seems longer than when I started.  Plenty of seating available, people don't tend to linger as long as me and my friends do."}
{"text":"Went to eat lunch and after we made our order found out my husband forgot his wallet. We only had enough to buy one burrito. The manager was nice enough to give us the second one for free. We apologize to this cafe Rio for not have the money for the food we ordered. But we are thankful for the kind staff that acomidated us!"}
{"text":"This was our very first visit to Cafe Rio. Placed online order - so easy to customize your menu choices.  Confirmation emails were prompt. Our order was on time, nicely packed, and you can tell the staff cares about the order. Interesting pulled pork - has a different BBQ flavor that sort of sets it apart from others. Pulled pork nachos and enchiladas for me and my husband, both tasted good for fast food. Will give it another shot!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating cafe rio at this location. My experience here wasn't so bad as other reviews. But I guess it's because my friend and I came around 6:00pm so the place wasn't too empty or too packed. It was just right and I didn't have to wait that long in line. It went by pretty fast and got my food on time so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Love this place. Anytime I go here its super busy but the line moves pretty quickly. Make sure you know what you want because they move quickly."}
{"text":"This was my very first time ever coming to Cafe Rio.  We were talking about dinner and she wanted their tortilla soup and I was in the mood  for a burrito.  So, Cafe Rio was the choice.  I have wanted to try this place for sometime.  I know it's a chain, but I've never heard of it until recently.  Anyhow, I park relatively close to Cafe Rio and walk in.  Easy enough to figure out the steps to order your food.  I hop in line and look at the menu that is written on a couple of signs.  As you're waiting you can see the employees making tortillas and other goodies.  I place my order of the Pork Burrito, and it was incredible.  Great portion and kept warm all the way back home.  I also ordered the soup with a side of chips and salsa.  They took care when putting my things in my to go bag.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  I'm sure I'll be back as both the food and the price were great."}
{"text":"I came here to get some dinner to go. It was really loud in there with music blasting.  I stood in line and watched as the employees put together orders from the ingredients along the counter. It looked very messy with food everywhere. Spills had not been cleaned up. It looked gross.   Despite that I ordered a quesadilla with steak. I really did not want to add anything else. The salsas and the guacamole looked like they had been out all day.   I took my quesadilla and went home. Ever wondered if you might get food poisoning, but ate it anyway. Well luckily I did not get food poisoning, but the quesadilla was not very good, and I ended up throwing most of it away.   I should've known when I saw how messy and dirty the food plan was that I should've just walked out."}
{"text":"Love the food at CafeRio, Hate the attitude that the staff at this location hold. I came to this location a few months back, and was met with everything but a smile and friendly attitude.  Unfortunately, this had happened again on 7/9/2017 at approximately 6:30PM. Their is one girl in particular that we have encountered on both occasions, and she will intentionally do the opposite of what you ask for one reason or another (evidently as a result of her being employed) as you can present with the softest approach but this then translates to her as hate; ruining the entire experience. The first experience had happened mid day around 1:00PM. I made the mistake of not getting her name, but given that she has remained employed for several months, i would assume the establishment is well aware of her existence. I will however offer a description, she has red hair with tattoos on her arm. Ill continue to go to cafe rio, but will surely opt to travel to the nearest other location on happy valley. Good Luck, invest in management who can keep an eye out for this type of behavior on shift. If this girl is the manager, re-assess you hiring and training process, because this girl does not know the foundation of quality service.  many other details contributed to the need to write this post, but i will summarize it with the above."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite chain restaurant. I've gotten so much free food because of their loyalty program/survey rewards. If you know me, you'll know that I can be erm.. selective about where I eat and spend my money. If you offer me free food though, and you serve decent food, I'll be there.  Since downloading the Rio rewards app four months ago, I've probably received almost $25 in free food. I only come here when I have a reward to use. The company will send emails saying, \"Hey! We like you, here's $5 to spend on anything you want!\"   The first time that happened to me, I also filled out a survey and got free chips and salsa. But that transaction produced another survey, which I filled out to get a tres leches cake with. I ended up getting enough food for myself and my boyfriend for about...$2.   The food itself is pretty good. I think I prefer the taste of Chipotle better, but for fast food, Cafe Rio is decent and doesn't make me feel like I need to run 10 miles to make up for it.  Their tacos are delicious and I love to see that spinning hot plate fry the dough up.   Service: everybody here is so friendly. I couldn't decide which free dessert to get, so they took a poll amongst all the staff. I ended up with the key lime.   It's clean, people are friendly, and free food abounds. The company is great with incentives, and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff. I usually visit this location 2-3 times a week & the staff is always polite & fast. Also, the red sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"What can i say some top of the line Mexican fast food. I love Mexican food and this was a good place. Everything here looks pretty good. But the best was the barbacoa pork and i also enjoying the Mexican style spaghetti. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"You know the famous 'Harry Met Sally' Scene? \"I'll have what she's having.\" (If not, check out this sound bite, WARNING PG13: http://www.filmsite.org/wavfiles/whenharrymetsally4.wav) That pretty sums up Cafe Rio for me. It's one of the highest calorie, highest carb meals I ever allow myself to indulge in anymore. They must put crack in their meat because this place calls to me from the far corners of my subconscious.  I try to be health conscious, so here's why I only eat here a few times a year: Pork Barbacoa Salad with black beans and all the fixings = 2112 calories, 257 grams of carbs., 103.5 grams of fat, 60.5 grams of protein, 95 mg cholesterol, & 4210 mg of sodium. Did I mention this was a salad??  I cut my calories and carbs down by skipping the tortilla, the guacamole, and I only use 1/2 of the creamy tomalillo dressing they give you (600 calories, and 26 carbs removed). I also can only eat half at a time because their portions are HUGE!  My all time favorite meal here is their aforementioned Pork Salad, which says an awful lot because I never order pork anything from anywhere. My stand by favorite is their chicken burrito, smothered with green sauce. (I'm salivating just thinking of it!) Everything is made fresh, tortillas included.  This location is great, always pleasant service. Be prepared to stand in a long line if you come at regular meal times, but I promise it's worth the wait. Law enforcement gets a 50% discount (but I believe you have to come in uniform). Also, ask for a punch card - every 10th meal is free!"}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling this at all.  We met up with a couple of friends and one said this was his spot.  My wife likes Cafe Rio a lot too.  They're famous for their sweet bbq pork which would've been great..in a barbecue sandwich! The sweetness was too much and really weird in a burrito, even weirder in the salad my wife got.  I would just go with the fire grilled steak or chicken if I could do it all over.  I also disliked how they wouldn't put guacamole in the actual burrito itself.  I was given a teeny, weeny scoop of The Incredible Hulk TV series colored avocado on the side.  That was gross.  Mexicant, Mexidont, Mexiwont.  A couple of things save Cafe Rio from 1 star and that's the quality of the tortillas and the drink station.  Their fresh tortillas could possibly be the best by a Mexican fast food chain and the biggest reason I may give it another shot.  The drink station is bigger than the usual and includes horchata, limeade and various teas."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Cafe Rio I hated it but when I went with my son and his girlfriend and really enjoyed it.  I believe that I chose poorly for my taste buds the first time.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent!! I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and was more than impressed EVERY time.    The BEST Taco Salad I have ever had.  I lived in Salt Lake City for nearly three years and ate at Cafe Rio at least 1 time per week. I now moved to Phoenix and am willing to drive 30 miles to get a Cafe Rio Salad."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy! This place is great. I love the pork. Its good in salads, enchiladas, tacos, burritos, whatever you want to put it in. Plus they have whole wheat tortillas for those of us who like them. I admit I wasn't impressed on my first visit because they do rush you through and its hard to make those split second decisions when you are just trying to figure out what is going on but after trying it a couple more times I was hooked. I was completely addicted to the place while I was pregnant. Just speak up and tell them what you want and how you want it and they will make it for you."}
{"text":"They have big portions and everything was fresh.  Salads looked really good. In comparison, Cafe Rio was similar to Chipotle but much better.  Anyway, I had the burrito and it was great.  It was an easy four stars.  The only thing holding back a five star rating was them being stingy with the meat. For eight bucks put on a little more meat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is superb! The food is excellent and the place is very well kept. This place is on the smaller side and can become crowded rather easily by all the centennial high school kids, but besides weekends this place doesn't become too crowded.     On my first visit I enjoyed a plain bean and cheese burrito(I know rather plain). A lot can go wrong with a plain bean and cheese burrito(most cases it tastes to plain). I was super impressed with the bean in cheese burrito! The tortilla was to die for, the cheese was delicious and the beans were cooked well(not too hard).    The staff is friendly, amazing food, nice facilities! Your sure to enjoy your visit to Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh but if you place an order for pickup, you shouldn't have to wait an additional half hour after the pickup time you are given"}
{"text":"Always great food when I come in, haven't had any problems besides a recent time with a line worker being completely snobby towards my sister, when all my sister did was ask a question.  There was an amazing young girl named Chandelier who had great customer service skills and was completely generous and sweet.  She even made an effort to jump on the line to help out while they were a little behind.  Besides the snobby line worker, great place to enjoy lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Great location right by UNLV. Was here for a class and was looking for a change from the usual pho place and stopped in here. We stopped in and the place was not too busy, just a small line at the cashier. I noticed everyone was getting everything made to order and the ingredients were really fresh. The ambiance was cool, colorful and very welcoming. Staff was also friendly and this is an easy place to spend an hour and hangout.   I got a chicken quesadilla and it was delicious. It was large, filling, and made with fresh tortillas and cheeses.  Chicken was tender and shredded and they were generous with it. You do need to wait a little more time here since they make all the meals to order, but I think its worth it.  Also the lime mint drink and homemade strawberry lemonade mixed together were awesome! I would come back just for that! I will be back for more chicken quesadillas."}
{"text":"Minus three stars. Went there because \"they have cold air\" instead of the delicious and cheaper dive down the road.  The staff was downright disrespectful all the way to the manager, who looked 18 years old. The service was very slow and made my tortillas over cooked, NOO guacamole! Just keep going ahead and have McDonald's, save yourself."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Like most Mexican places in town this restaurant is a bit overpriced. The food lacked flavor and the service was rude, and you know how much I hate rudeness from staff when I am eating out. If I don't know what \"guaca\" (guacamole) means don't blame me, I only grew up in Mexico, so what do I know? I did enjoy the Southwest Limeade."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio  But sadly after three to four visits of disappointments at this location  It seems like the evening crew is a lot of inexperienced workers my meal is usually wrong I never put lettuce they automatically put it on before asking, the online app to place orders doesn't work , they always run out of items after 6pm and food is cold waiting the tomatoes are wet just to many issues please address"}
{"text":"Good food is the only thing going for them- everything else sucks!!! you have to really remember what you want cuz when u get up to order there is no menu to look at. Long long lines! Only once was I asked about he frequent customer card.   I ordered a daily special and was told it came with a drink (I didn't know I was ordering a daily special) and I was charged like $9.79!! How is that a free drink!?!? Normal price of the food is $7.99!! Don't tell me it's a free drink cuz it's not free!  Togo orders suck cuz the lids they use are so flimsy multiple orders in a bag slide around and made my food a pile of mush.   Made an order online- food sat on corner and was cold when I got home to eat it."}
{"text":"The took care of my vegan needs very well! Best salad I've had in quite sometime. Lovely work people keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband when we first moved to the area, as it is down the street from our apartment.  Portions were huge and were tasty, and their system of dealing with large lines is efficient.  Everything is fresh and packed so if you don't finish it, you can just take it home without any fuss.  Unlike Chipolte there seems to be a chance you can actually eat something healthy here.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Today I ordered ahead of time came in order was ready made fresh with great friendly service! Such an improvement!!!!!"}
{"text":"On Friday 4/28, I came down with food poisoning. After discussing with my doctor, he said it was probably from eating there. Apparently he's had numerous patients get sick from eating there!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, with a great atmosphere and pricing. Me and my bestie go here often for the specials and we've been going here for years. We plan to continue doing so. I personally like the sweet pork, but my friend likes the spicy sauces on the steak. Both are delicious. The green sauce goes great with the sweet pork."}
{"text":"This is an average fast food place. They serve large portions and for the entree, it's not over priced. They make it up in the extras.    And be careful how you order, because both times I've ordered online and my order was different than how I thought it would be.  My fault? Probably, but that means their ordering system online isn't clear.  Overall, not great, not bad...average."}
{"text":"I somehow always find myself craving their enchilada style burritos - just thinking about them now is making my mouth water! Lol   Every time I go to this location it's never busy, even at lunch, and I get to order right away which is a great thing! I always get the veggie burrito, enchilada style with no cheese or sour cream (for all my fellow vegans that don't want to miss out on the all the cafe rio deliciousness!). The vegetarian burrito comes with double rice, double beans and free scoops of guacamole which always leaves me super stuffed after my meal!   The staff is very friendly, there's this one lady that is always such in a radiant mood every single time I see her that it makes even the grumpiest customer there smile! Lol   Don't forget to scan your Cafe Rio app at the register to collect points enough to get $10 credit on your next meal!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this chain. Dang you get a lot of food. It is a little on the pricey side for fast-cazh.  I was thrilled when I saw this was coming to this location, oh-so close to my home.   The people that work there are incredibly welcoming and friendly. The lady that works in the dining room is like an old friend - we've been there only twice and we talk to her like we've known her for decades.   You get exactly what you ask for."}
{"text":"Giving two stars because the employees were nice and displayed good customer service. However the place was a mess, everything was cross contaminated and looked like the food bar hadn't been kept clean. The meat was so dry, it was clear that it had been sitting out a while. I ordered a sweet pork salad and the avocado tasted rotten and really sour. I got sick immediately after eating. I won't go back to this cafe rio because of the cleanliness."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of cafe rio. Everything is extremely good. So I was thrilled to find out that they were making a cafe rio down the street from my house! Literally a mile away! ( awesome right? ) but since they been open, I've probably been there about 3 times but i've had such shitty customer service. They have run out of sauce for salads in mid afternoon and had no more chicken???"}
{"text":"I give this place (& I call it a place because the staff is unfriendly as HECK!!) 3 stars because I did order the right menu item but didn't have any warm & fuzzy feeling like they want you to come back. They figured everyone wants to eat here. Not a problem, there is only 1 staff member that actually greets a customer & she isn't a server; she's a custodian !! Food good , ambience good, service sucks & expects the customer to \"be here\". Not a great feeling."}
{"text":"The Vegetarian burrito is so yummy.  I recommend getting the ranch sauce drizzled on top!!"}
{"text":"This place did not impress me . I got the chicken enchiladas and they were not that tasty to me unfortunately. The rice and beans were just okay. This place is kinda like a lower grade version of chipotle to me but with a few more dish options I guess. Probably won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio- a place I select for lunch/dinner at least 2x a week. looking for a quick and grab, no hassle meal this is the place to be. They don't have the most locations around town but makes it well worth the drive to find one. I love the variety here; healthy alternatives to a pile of nachos, extra cheese please! I normally get 'everyone's norm' the shredded chicken salad with their cilantro dressing. I'll let you all in one a little secret. Get the shredded lettuce vs the normal Romaine lettuce they use. It truly makes a difference and you don't have huge pieces of lettuce falling out your mouth. And how did I go so long not trying their tortilla soup!! Truly amazing so amazing I'm drooling as I'm thinking about it.  My current pet peeve about this place..their cilantro. I love cilantro! I just don't like getting the whole branch of the cilantro in my salad or my tacos. HELP!!"}
{"text":"I found the food to be very bland and not a great value. The restaurant was also a little dirty. I wanted to have some of their lime aid and the machine was turned off. Looking in the machine it looked very dirty which made me worry about the  cleanliness of the rest of the place. We sat outside. The tables were dirty. I wont be hurrying back."}
{"text":"Very rude workers, supported by management, if you want to be charged twice for mediocre food from staff who doesnt wash hands when exiting the bathroom, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Placed an order through the app. Apparently no one bothers to check orders placed in this manner. Arrived at the time I was given and the person then went to get my order started. Great service.... NOT!!  Congratulations to Cafe Rio on Blue Diamond for being the slowest food establishment in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this place before but my bf said it was good and we went there yesterday. This is my new favorite place to eat. The burrito I had was everything I had always wanted a burrito to be. I don't know why some people are complaining about this place. It was so so good. I ordered the fire-grilled chicken burrito enchilada style. On the burrito I had the hot red sauce, cheese, the spicy salsa, guacamole, and on the side, the tomatillo ranch dressing. The mint limeade was pretty good too. For two burritos and two drinks, the total was about $25. But, I ate for two days from it (half the burrito that day and half the next day). It was fine heated up in the microwave. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt slightly rushed, and we were only  one of about 3 couples in the place at the time."}
{"text":"Our order consisted of the hatch chile chicken burrito and a 2 taco plate +drink. Total bill was $18+ it's less than $10 a person. Food was good and filling. All staff was very nice, not just one person.  I wish they had a location in California."}
{"text":"Super amazing & best quality in freshness! Be sure to get a stamp card because you will be coming back! Aside from the great food, I recommend the sweet pork tacos, they have fresh made lemon aids and horchata! Chips and caso is also really good on a lunch for 2! And don't forget the fresh made Key Lime Pie !"}
{"text":"Super awesome tastes SO GOOD!!! Will come back very soon. Eric was Very kind and gave us plenty of reasons to come back! Happy they do military discounts too. My salad was delicious my kids loved their food also!"}
{"text":"So a ad from fb popped up for a BOGO free and figured I'd give it a try. So glad I did it was fast fresh and delicious !!!! The employees where really friendly. It's like Chipotle but way better. They have a wide selection and did I mentioned the little kids eat free not every item just the little Ninos cheese crisp which this mamma appreciates a lot because I'm so sick of my kids taking one or two bites or something because they don't like it or are full. You parents out there know what I'm talking about and if you don't pm me your trips for non picky great eaters. But back to the yummy food.The salads are huge and very good I did the roast beef sounded strange but a friend of mine ordered it and says it's a favorite.my husband ordered a burrito and thought it was really good. They had horchata drinks that looked good I didn't try it but plan to next time. I will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is amazing, but not this location. For over a year now, either the drink machines have been broken, or staff is too lazy to refill them. (I'm inclined to go with the latter.)   On our last visit, we ordered a steak quesadilla. Three ingredients. I'll let you take a guess at which one was missing. While they remade the quesadilla, this is just what's expected from this location. Long wait times, indifferent staff, half of what they advertise that makes them unique unavailable."}
{"text":"Food was decent but not my favorite Mexican place. Service was slow and the young lady that took my order was inattentive and stared off towards the door like she was ready to run out at any second. Way overpriced for fast food quality."}
{"text":"Great food. They seem over worked or understaffed. Maybe they are undertrained. Perhaps they are so busy they don't care about customer service. My wife and I stopped in for dinner. I ordered a grilled chicken burrito. Delicious. I had a difficult time explaining I wanted the burrito pictured as a special offering. The girl had no clue what I was talking about even though a picture was right there. My wife ordered the chicken soup and ONE coconut shrimp taco, not the meal. Again we had a very difficult time explaining to 4 people she only wanted 1 taco. They put black beans in the tin; which we didn't want and threw out. They gave us a drink cup for soda we didn't take and said it's part of the meal. I tried one last time to explain \"we only want 1 taco\".  I wound up paying for the shrimp taco meal and only received 1 taco. Emailed customer service and have been ignored. I'll do my part to help service at this busy location by never returning."}
{"text":"Def need to watch what they charge you for. I ordered a salad and then (since it was Tuesday) asked if taco was just $1.95? Employee told me yes so I added a taco. She asked if I wanted lettuce, beans, rice and pico with it? I told her no pico. On my salad, the lettuce wasnt really cut up, like it's just ripped a leaf in half- need knife to cut it up. While getting good bagged to go, cashier gives me a cup. I told her I wasnt ordering a drink and she says it comes with the taco. I asked isn't the taco just $1.95? She said yes. Look at bill and they charged me for rice and beans....last time I was here they also charged me sour cream when I said no to having it but the girl still put it on there. Last time I'll be at this location."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see only 3 starts for Cafe Rio. I think is really good. Homemade tortillas de harina hit the spot! I ordered two asada tacos. I asked for pico de Gallo, guacamole, salsa, cilantro and a spicy salsa for my tacos. Delish!! The ladies were very friendly. Horchata water was also good. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has steadily gone down hill the past couple of years.  It seems as if they let a couple of high school kids run this place now... I like Cafe Rio because the food used to be fresh and simple, but now I don't even bother going to this location.  The past few times I was there they seemed to be out of items, for example they were out of chicken once.  The last time I was there I was eating the chicken burrito enchilada style and the chicken wasn't even shredded like it should be.  It was huge pieces of chicken instead of shredded chicken.  Also, if your going to have a open kitchen keep it clean."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio's concept is similar to Chipotle, but Rio offers a few more options (e.g., salads, enchiladas).  I would have gotten the three tacos with fire-grilled steak... except they were out of fire-grilled steak.  The person who ordered in front of me got fire-grilled steak... so I guess he got the last of it.  It was around 6pm on a Wednesday, so I'm not quite sure what that is about.    Anyway, I ended up ordering a pork barbacoa taco and a chicken taco.  The barbacoa taco was fantastic... but super messy and just kept dripping all over the place.  However, I can handle a mess when the taco is this good.  Unfortunately, I can't really say the same for the chicken taco... but I did see that they offer an upgraded chicken, so I guess I must have ordered the chicken that they know is not their best chicken.  Strange thinking there.  The chips were out of a bag, but the queso was pretty good.  It had a little bit of a canned (or bagged) cheese taste, but the added peppers, onions, etc. made it pretty good.  I will give this place another shot when I'm back in Vegas, but only after checking out all of the other options."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I have never had a problem with Cafe Rio. Also the 2 stars are only because my dinner was good. However tonight I was at this location and the sign says they are open till 11:00 on Friday nights. However as we were finishing our meal at 10:05 the staff rudely yelled \"get out\" to us. Yes. I am serious. Funny that they kick paying customers out 55 minutes before closing and basically shut the restaurant down. Also saw a couple try to come at 10:15 and the door was locked and staff was in the process of cleaning up. If your sign says you're open until 11:00, then be up until then. I won't be returning to this location after being yelled at to get out."}
{"text":"Had a great visit. Food was really good this time. We had the nachos which were stacked high. Staff was friendly. Can't think of any complaints on this visit. Highly recommended location."}
{"text":"This food here is very good, but this place has a major issue though. The lack of staffing, only 3 people preparing food and sometimes two. They are so nice and friendly, if you come here at dinner time you probably will waist long time on line waiting for food. And always food gets cold because it waits to long before you get to the cashier."}
{"text":"Moved into the area in June and have been here 4x.   Seems to be always crowded but they move you through the cafeteria style line quickly.  A lot of people order specials so that is why it's a bit slow to order imo.    Chips and salsa is good, and good value for the money,   I generally have the salad and it is mostly salad and for the price isn't worth it but if u get them to throw some extra rice in there and to not skimp on one meat, it's worth the value."}
{"text":"Average americanized mexican at a high price.  Go to Faustos or Robertos instead.."}
{"text":"Meh..........  Mediocre food Mediocre service Overpriced for what you get  Very uninspired place and the whole premise of the place is just boring. This place is just a rift on Chipotle, Zabas, Hot Head Burrito, etc......"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while, we'll definitely return.  Their hottest sauce not very hot but with the variety of bottled sauces they make available to you makes up for it.  I'm a big fan of queso and chips and this place does have fresh yummy chips and their queso was very good, a bit salty but good."}
{"text":"This location almost always has a line and I've come to realize it's because they are sooooooo slow. Management really needs to get on it over there. I now avoid this location at all costs because I don't have time for the slow service."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time yesterday and enjoyed the food.  We stood back and figured out what we wanted and let some other people go in front of us so we didn't hold up the line.  Not a big line anyways when we went.  There was a woman making tortillas as we were about to order.  I thought that was cool to see that they make their own.    I ordered two tacos with the chili roast beef.  I definitely enjoyed them and wow they are big!  I was like how do you eat these?  I wasn't a fan of the wild rice but did enjoy the black beans.  I also enjoyed the fresh made tortillas with my tacos.  My friend ordered a burrito enchilada style and wow it was so big!  She couldn't finish it all.  We also did chips and quac and I thought they tasted very good.  We didn't feel rushed and the service seems pretty similar to how you order at Chipotle or Zabas.  Not an issue for me.  The place was clean and relaxing.  I definitely am going to visit this place again.  New place is found."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorites but has gone down hill fast.  Run out of key ingredients frequently and no flow makes service slow and annoying.  6 or 7 working the line and each of them asks the same questions while trying to figure out which order is yours.  On 1 occasion... Waited 20 minutes to have a \"manager\" check to see if they had any more pork while holding up the line and being ignored.   Then caught attitude for trying to be patient and flag someone down to just change my order.  Unfortunately I'm done with this place but 2 stars since I used to love it. :("}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE grilled chicken!!!! I had tried to order it twice now ( both to-go ) and it tastes like rubber. It was so horrible I had to pick every single piece out of my salad and throw it out . The texture of the grilled chicken is so disgusting and you can barley chew it.   So gross. I basically just paid $10 for lettuce."}
{"text":"Food is always tasty and I never complain but.....I went to this Cafe Rio on Sunday Oct 5 for dinner around 7pm and they were running out of a lot of toppings especially the cilantro lime sauce which is the only reason why I eat there in the first place!!! They have two types of salad dressings: a cilantro lime and tomatillo ranch. I repeat! Only 2 dressings! How could they possibly run out? It's called make some more! Anyways they also ran out of the Mexican white cheese and guac it was ridiculous. I think it was an off day for them or poor management, I have no clue. I'm giving 3 stars because I love Cafe Rio, the flavor and portion size but Sunday was not happening!"}
{"text":"Absolutely aweful service tonight. Even the staff knew it giving me 2 stamps on my card on the way out"}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem to be too popular with my Yelp pals, but I like it. I don't have a Cafe Rio too close to my house, so I'll admit that it's not something I'd choose as a regular dining destination.  However, this location is a convenient option for my work week when I don't bring anything from home and when I need a break from the crazy chicken place. My usual order is the shredded chicken breast enchiladas with black beans and rice. I'm also a fan of their freshly made tortillas.  Service has been efficient and friendly plus I've never had to wait in a long line, something that's very important when you're short on time.  I'll continue to be a fan as long as they keep serving up decent food in a timely manner--gracias!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I really like Cafe Rio's food.   Now - this location I've been to 4 times since it's right by my house. Normally I go to the one by UNLV.   At this location, every single time they have messed up an order or I've gotten the wrong food. Like another reviewer said, I've also been overcharged , although mine was for add-ons that I didn't order and didn't receive. One of the workers, who has been there everyime I have, basically ignores you when you order, and just puts everything on your order even if you ask for it without.   The service is also incredibly slow at this location. If the one by UNLV can handle the college lunch rush plus take out and catering, there is absolutely no reason why this location can't. If you're in line in-store, your food will sit and get cold while they blatantly ignore you and instead fill an online or catering order. But if you order online, they don't even start the order until you get there to pick it up- and even then, it sits by the cashier who is clueless as to who the order belongs to.  If you don't mind slow service and get getting what you order or pay for, then this place is fine. Otherwise, just avoid this location."}
{"text":"NEVER EAT AT THIS LOCATION.   The sweet pork tastes good, but I am absolutely outraged by the lack of customer service at this location. While they were making my tacos they \"realized\" that they put \"too much\" chicken in the pan and promptly removed it from my order so that they could save money on the meat they were using for my order. On top of all that they got the order wrong and only gave us two tacos instead of three. Horrendous customer service and complete lack of ability to provide to the wishes of the consumer."}
{"text":"Went in this place at 1:20 this afternoon. Have been to the Stephanie locations a few times. This place was a nightmare. First problem is the amount of parking. Why build these places if you are not going to put in ample parking.  Second problem is this place is filthy. The tables are covered with a black grease that fills the cracks and crevices on the tables. The floors look filthy. This place was disgusting. The quality of food doesn't even come close to the Stephanie location. Stay away from this place. Don't know how the health dept allows it to stay open."}
{"text":"In the past this place has been fine. They didn't get my orders wrong and the service was prompt. However, today this locations service was terrible and it wasn't only me. It seemed like everyone else here's orders were wrong and mixed up. I placed an online order and when I arrived after 20 minutes of waiting I realized had I just got in line I would have been eating much sooner than placing the online order. And they got my daughters order completely wrong forgot to give me my drinks and made my wife's salad completely wrong."}
{"text":"I decided to visit your establishment last Wednesday for the first time in 3+ months and return today.  During my visit today I ordered 2 grilled chicken tacos and was not advised at the time of my order that grilled chicken was extra.  (This is common among other fast food establishments).  Once the tacos were ready for toppings I asked for a drizzle of the ranch dressing, at this time I was asked which size of a side I wanted.  I informed the manager that I only wanted a drizzle and at this time I was advised there was a cost.  I informed her I was not charged the prior week (manager during prior visit actually indicated the tacos are better with the ranch, but she prefers bacon ranch) and the gentleman ahead of me was not charged.  She became visibly annoyed and said she wouldn't charge me this time but would next time.  Luckily for me there will not be a next time.  Icing on the cake. I found two hairs in my food...."}
{"text":"The food is good, we have been there a few times. The dinning area could be maintained a lot better,its kind of dirty. This place is always packed and im sure thats why its so dirty. The food will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Where is the manager???   These poor kids are dying on the line with a line wrapped around and no person in charge helping them. You can see how stressed out they are and need more help but with no leadership. I've been waiting for my pickup order for 20 minutes at this point and I'm still standing here waiting for someone to make my food. In the time I've been here 3 people have come up saying their order has been wrong. Wait-make that 4.   I feel bad for these kids on the line.   In addition to that, there is no one in the time I've been here to clean up tables. I understand there are bad nights but it's no excuse for the management team to not be helping!!    Update: promise time was 748 pm and I finally got my food at 820!!"}
{"text":"We have attended this location 3 different times. Unfortunately every time the people working the counter are extremely slow and the food is either too salty or under cooked (rice). This location needs to get its act together to keep up with the businesses around the area."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here, but I'm not too pleased about their slow service and small servings. I recently went in here for lunch for a change instead of Chipotle and at the time they didn't have any steak available. The server then had me wait on my exact spot in line until it was finished cooking (expected to have been between 5-7 minutes) while he served other people that weren't getting steak. I ended up leaving to go to Chipotle because of the long wait and the awkwardness I felt as people walked right past me as I waited in my spot in line.  What keeps me coming back is really the food. The house dressing is amazing, meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned every time. I do wish they'd be a little more generous when it comes to their servings--I barely had any rice in my last tostada.  Overall, I'd consider occasionally coming back to this location since it's closest to home but only when I'm not at a time crunch."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate place for an awesome great tasting american style mexican food.   I was introduced to this place by a knockoff in vegas, that was soon replaced with the real deal and have yet to find anything in this place i do not like.   Everyone I have brought here has loved it and become a fan. The enchiladas are awesome and my wifes favorite. I like a pork burrito with mild sauce black beans and rice....the flavor will stick with you forever.   I highly recommend this to anyone! I do wish they would open up more locations in the valley so I can let my other family members in surprise fall in love.  I even had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner..."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 1 star since there's no 0 stars option!! This place is sooooo dirty! I am allergic to dairy and the girls wouldn't even bother to change their gloves after I told them about my allergies! They had all the toppings scattered around the serving area! Very dirty and unhealthy! So of you have dairy or any kind of allergies you are NOT gonna be safe here!!! I had to walk out! Employs were rude as well!! Will NEVER go in there again!"}
{"text":"Food was good, slightly pricey for what you get but worth it every once in awhile. We asked for no lettuce on the tacos and still got lettuce. I asked for a sample of the rice and the guy gave me a little cup to try and when I got to the register the cashier tried ringing me up for a side of rice. She also realized she didn't ring up a tiny side of sour cream AFTER we paid so then she requested us to pay $0.67 for it. Such an inconvenience and it is a tablespoon of sour cream! Why would I need to be charged for that, even a gas station has more common sense."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cafe' Rio for a couple years now and have been to several locations. Their food is always consistently good. One of my favorite dishes is the grilled chicken enchiladas with their \"hottest\" sauce which I think is mild along with a nice serving of black beans and rice. I love how you can see the tortilla's being made while you watch them prepare your meal! Nothing beats fresh tortillas!! Another recommendation would be the pork burrito made enchilada style. This burrito is huge but oh so yummy! Overall, you can't go wrong with any dish you order at Cafe' Rio. Their food is really fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I came on New Year's Day and was pleasantly surprised to walk into such a nice cafe rio. This location is unlike the others I've been to (eastern & blue diamond locations). It's incredibly modern inside and it reminds me more of a knock off chipotle atmosphere compared to the other locations which have a typical Mexican fast food feel.   The drink selection at this location looked incredible. I have to admit that I've never noticed that they make their own drinks at the other locations.... The way they display them here made me want to buy a drink & I am your typical, only a water cup, please, customer.   Food is still just, okay. The chicken was seasoned well but the portions are minuscule compared to their competitors. One of which is a short drive away...they also need a spicer mild salsa option.  The tortillas are delicious. Can I just buy a whole plate of those?    Also, better service then the other southwest location on blue diamond. So drive the extra 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio used to be one of my favorites, but this location seems to have a plethora of problems. First and foremost they rush you through the line as fast as possible, slapping your food together like it owes them money. The employees do not pay attention to what you ask for, and throw whatever they like onto your requested item of food, which is bad customer service - and really, really annoying. I requested a chicken salad with black beans - no rice - shredded lettuce. What I got was a pile of beef on a tin with iceberg lettuce. When I tried to correct the order, I received huffs and gruff from the female employee and food thrown back into its receptacles. Wow.  The place is packed - every day. There seems to be no reprieve, and they have run out of items completely at least three times that I have been there. Any time I have ordered takeout, the order has been incorrect, items left out, and one time I even received someone else's order which I had to drive all the way back to the Restaraunt! Waste of gas, time, and money.  I probably won't go to this location again. It just seems as though the high school employees behind the counter couldn't care less about anything, including the cleanliness of the dining area. Not to mention the complete lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio: The siren of South Maryland Parkway. It lures you in, only to rip your head off through your wallet.   I've been so tempted to try this place out for months, but I always end up eating at Yayo Taco instead. $5 student special just can't be beat. Thinking a meal would be about $8, I thought I would FINALLY try Cafe Rio on 5/10/11 when I had some down time between classes.   There's hardly anything to pick from the super tiny menu and everything is at least 20% overpriced. I was too embarrassed to just walk out so I decided to try the pork salad with cilantro dressing and extra limes. I also ordered a small drink because I was really in the mood for tea (unsweetened only!)   The salad was good. Actually, it was very good, but it wasn't worth what they were charging. I don't see the point of the flour tortilla bowl inside the metal to-go bowl, so that got thrown away, rather than eaten.   The flavored teas were good but the lids on the cups don't stay on very well. Unfortunately, one of the power doors at school hit my cup out of my hand so it exploded all over my white skirt and white jacket. Yes, their tea does stain.   If the place was cheaper, it would get another star, but it didn't so it won't get one."}
{"text":"My family does not eat pork because they lean kosher (we're not Jewish) - Cafe Rio's pork barbacoa is so good, that I allowed this to be my cheat pork (which segued to me just giving up the no pork thing all together.)   Is Cafe Rio overpriced? YEP! Are the lines too long at times? Yep! Do they need more people working the line at all times? YEP! Do their desserts look like they've been run over by a truck in the hot sun? Yep!  You know what? I don't care. I order the same thing every time - pork barbacoa salad - no rice, no beans, no tortilla, double all the vegetables with their addictive house dressing. This is the food of the gods.   I don't care about all the other issues with Cafe Rio because in the end, I have become addicted to their salads and I don't think I can give them up."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they opened and still like chipotle better. I've ordered their nachos and quesadilla here and they are both real greasy and not consistent depending on who's making the food. I do like the whole 10 meals and get 1 free punch card idea which is cool. Their customer service is cool although I did see one employee be kind of rude to a customer which I think could have been handled better. All in all I guess if I'm desperate and too lazy to go somewhere else I'd go here. But would be one of my last options."}
{"text":"The food at Cafe Rio is some of my very favorite. I love Chipotle too, but the reason why I would say I like Cafe Rio more is because of their green ranch, YUM! That ranch is something else. I smother my burritos in it and always choose it for my salad dressing - a gift from the gods.   Another thing, I'm not entirely sure if Chipotle has Daily Specials or not, but if they do, Cafe Rio does a better job of advertising them. I love Cafe Rio's Daily Specials because they come with a free drink! Good deal, considering their menu is pretty pricy (the reason I withheld one star).  I am most particularly appreciative of this location because this Cafe Rio is right across the street from UNLV, so I never have to go far whenever I crave their food, which is ALWAYS. Haha. Big plus.  ALSO! Their ice!  For those of you who love icy cold drinks like me, I'm sure you are also fond of their ice. All other food establishments need to follow suit."}
{"text":"Had to update as my first experience here was awful but since then I gave it another try because my husband loved it and this time it was amazing! Finally got the meat I asked for! Had steak tacos! So filling! My friend had the street tacos, one beef, chicken and fish. They are pretty plain with just onions and meat but she said they were great. Also got a horchata which was really flavourful and tasty.  Would go again!"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio ! Best salads..Best House dressing. I love how fresh the tortillas are. However this location lacks a lot of those qualities . I got the salad as i usually do the tortilla was really cold . Good didn't taste too fresh. The tortillas were not being cooked in front of you as they normally are . Employees lacked customer service . I had to go ask for a tortilla and they gave me one wrapped in foil . I wasn't pleased and couldn't finish the salad ."}
{"text":"The food is really good I love the tacos but the beans are all water and also each time I ask for corn tortillas they give me flour and I have to ask them to fix it. It's happened the last three times I've gone. Also the staff really rushes you through the line and I always have to ask the person at the end to add in my salsa and other stuff because the people are trying to push you down the line so fast. Other than that the food is really good and I would recommend"}
{"text":"Very poor service! Over a period of a few visits I have experienced a lack of attention by employees. It usual takes at four times to communicate a basic order of two chicken tacos, guacamole and chips. I sent a basic message to their corporate office. No response! Called corporate and was told manager was going to call. Never heard from manager. Great food! However the down fall is the staff. Maybe they need take instruction from Chick Fil A."}
{"text":"You won't get better tasting or higher quality Mexican food! The Pork is my favorite flavored pork in the world. Similar to Chipotle with the big burrito size and you coach them along in making it but the end result is that the taste of Cafe Rio blows anywhere else out of the water. Also, got a burrito to take home to San Diego and the guy made it special, all separated to keep the ingredients tasting the best. Just ate it tonight and was just as good as same day in the restaurant. Seriously, get the pork. For all you degenerates who go to Vegas for every reason under the sun with eating last on the list of things to do, highly consider adding a stop into Cafe Rio for your one meal of the trip. Thanks Cafe Rio, you are delicious."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio, especially their sweet pork tacos. I normally don't have an issue here when I go however they are very slow compared to other locations. Don't recommend going when they're busy because the staff seems to be all over the place and have a hard time remembering what dish belongs to who. Because of this they messed up my order and gave me someone else's food and also added stuff when I clearly said no thank you."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were greeted with an overflowing trash can right by the door. As we stood in line ordering our toppings the food prep and serving area was very messy. The person making the burritos didn't ask my son what else he wanted on the burrito, he added beans and rice and sealed it up. They refilled half empty lettuce bins with their hands and tongs, right in front of me. They put fresh produce on top of old. I should have walked out right then. The clerk didn't even know how to count change properly. Nothing about this place impressed me and with their poor health code standards, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pork Barbacoa salad is the bomb. Very good portion size and decently priced. One bowl would be enough to feed 2 people. Tastes great and the pulled pork is delicious. I always visit it when I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"Food: chicken enchilada with green sauce. The food is WAY TOO SALTY! I won't be back because of this.  Ambiance: really cute and colorful inside and family friendly. Too bad the food was so salt-infused.  Location: Next to Grimaldi's pizza on Eastern.  Service: cafeteria-like. Not sure why it takes so long to go down this line. Cashier process seems disorganized as they try to understand what you've ordered. It would be helpful to have the menu posted above the workers head so you can order more efficiently.  Won't be back - yuck."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! I love the shredded chicken salad. I'm here at least three times a week because  of my craving!  Staff is also polite and friendly."}
{"text":"I've not been to the restaurant but we had this food catered and it's so good! The queso is to die for! Looking forward to taking my family to the actually restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here. My biggest complaint is when you order online and pick up they always give you such a tiny portion of meat. It's like because you're not there watching them make it they rip you off."}
{"text":"Tonight I tried the on line ordering app for cafe Rio. Using the app on my phone was a bit confusing and I made a mistake on one order.  I called the store's phone number to correct it.  Went in a bit early to pick up only to be told that \"the order didn't go through.\"  Per the employee this was the third time it happened on this date.  She took my order and said it would be worked on.  About 20 minutes later, I was given my bag of food.  Luckily I looked through the bag.  They missed two of my sides I ordered and paid a ridiculous amount for and completely forgot my order of chips and salsa.  I asked to speak to the manager.  Her response was \"I don't know why your order didn't go through\". I said I was disappointed in that the order still wasn't correct when I looked through the bag and I wasn't offered anything as a compensation.  Her response, \"they can't do that but should have told me\"... still didn't offer anything for my inconvenience.  I understand they are newly opened and very busy but they may want to train their staff on more customer service ideas when there are problems like this.  At least the food was good."}
{"text":"I used to like cafe rio, until I went here.  There were 4 people in line so I figured I'd speed right through. It the guy starting the order didn't listen at all. I had to say what I wanted multiple times, he put obscene amounts of sauce on, and made it smothered when I didn't mention it. After he had smothered it and obligating me to the dollar extra I had mentioned that I didn't want it smothered. He looked at me stupefied and then offered to wipe the sauce off. To make things easier I just bit the bullet and continued along my way. After getting the burrito made it was another 5 minute wait while the 2 people ahead of me were being ignored by the 5 staff members standing around doing nothing.   Finally I arrive at the register to find my food lidded and bagged when I was getting it to stay. Another stupefied employee doing nothing to resolve the situation and seemingly put off when I asked for a tray.  Once I finally started eating, roughly 10 minutes after the burrito was made, I was overwhelmed by the copious amounts of hot sauce that the burrito was swimming in, and the only other discernable taste or texture was the undercooked rice that crunched with each bite.  Needless to say, I won't be going back to cafe rio anymore."}
{"text":"5/27 Last two times we've picked up food to go our orders have been wrong. First time, my husband, who is lactose intolerant, had cheese put in his burrito (yes, he said \"no cheese\"). Had to drive back to have them fix it. This time the left out everything that is supposed to be in a salad except meat, lettuce and cheese?! What? Now my husband is driving back again to have our order fixed. Does this location not have any training, oversight or standards?! They just OPENED! We will not be coming here again.   * called management (Dre)to let them know the issue, was cut off multiple times. Wouldnt let me tell him my order, acted like he already knew it?! Which he didn't. Obviously this isnt the first time tonight this has happened! Shocking! He wasn't interested in what my actual order was and told me that my order was wrong because \"I ordered incorrectly\"?! Didnt even want to hear what happened, was so rude!!! Did mention that he had a new \"trainee\" but still took no responsibility! No WONDER this location has 2.9 stars!!! Run away!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The service sucked as I was put on hold immediately without so much as a hello when I called to place an order for pick up. My fiancée ended up just driving there after I waited on hold TWICE and finally hung up. It was a 45 min wait if we ordered in store or 20 min wait if we ordered on line from the stupid seating area. There was nothing on my nachos except beans, horribly big strips of undercooked steak and some shredded cheese! No guac, no sour cream, no pico de gallo...won't ever be going back! I make better Mexican food at home and I'm a gringa!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio period, but this location is the best by far. Clean and welcoming. The customer service is what makes it. Super friendly and kind. I will travel of my way to visit this location. Food is awesome as well from the homemade tortillas to the horchata, bomb. I'm from Chicago so trust me, I know good food!"}
{"text":"Tried the on line order process and still had to wait 15 minutes at the cafe.  I was in a rush (game 4) and found out they forgot to include an order that I had paid for after I got home.  How can you mess up an online order?   I called and asked to have my charge card credited  but they said they couldn't do that w/o the credit card.  After driving all the way back, still had to wait for my order of nachos.  My salad was very salty and I couldn't  eat it.  I have nothing good to say about this place and will never go back."}
{"text":"Not something to write home about.   I had the shredded chicken enchilada and roast beef enchilada both with medium green sauce.  Although the roast beef was good I thought both were bland for a Mexican place.  I guess their competition would be a Chipotle but Cafe Rio ranks well below them. So so place, I'll spend my dining out money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We ordered to go.. And we had to return to getissing food. Got there to get it, and waited for 10inites before anyone even helped. Still had to ask for missing items and still had to wait."}
{"text":"I keep getting dragged here by my best friend and I gotta say...I haven't had one thing that I've liked.   The portions are big but the food is so gross it doesn't matter.  The time before last I had nachos cuz' I was thinkin'....you can't screw that up!  Blech....the chips tasted like they were a month old and fried in the same oil from 1956.  I'm not that picky but these chips were icky. My tummy wasn't right for two days afterwards.   The last time I got a burrito...enchilada style. It was a gross mushy mess.  The rice was so mushy and overcooked.  It had rice, black beans, and 8 measly little strips of steak.  They dumped some green sauce all over it and threw it in a warmer.  Yuck.  Did not like. Waste of $8.79.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day!!!  They had a machine with horchata & two different types of agua frescas but it was empty.  Boo."}
{"text":"If you want stale and very dry hard rice you'd come to the right place! I was looking forward to trying something new since I usually go to Chipotle when I am craving Americanized Mexican food. I think I will be sticking to Chipotle for awhile.  The flour tortilla was really greasy, the guacamole was tasteless and expensive for 1 oz serving and was a shade of olive green, the rice was sooo hard like it wasn't cooked! Also, the black beans were overcooked and were clumpy and kinda dry.   Overall I think their food just looks quiet unappetizing because the presentation along with what I tasted today were not good. Plus, the back of the house was kinda messy along with messy steam tables...if you have an open kitchen I'd recommend to keep it presentable."}
{"text":"I love the food here, just have to post this since it is the second time in a row my burrito was made falling apart! Such an inconvenience and a mess."}
{"text":"Good food! Love getting the tostada with the pork! Very tasty! Also like the horchata! Healthy options and very fresh tasting! The dressings are very good as well and the medium salsa is the best!!"}
{"text":"Really close to ASU's campus for when you're craving some good Mexican food on the go. This place is a step up from Chipotle or Qdoba, with how they season their meat along with the spices in their salsas. I tried their sweet pork barbacoa, which was fantastic, but I've also had great sweet pork elsewhere.  Not the best fast food Mexican restaurant around, but I'll definitely stop by for a quick, good meal when I'm around the north side of ASU."}
{"text":"so happy to see one of our favorites from Orange County is now near us!  food is fresh, handmade and yummy.  Love the various and different lemonades and made-in-front-of-you tortillas!  Yeah for your arrival!"}
{"text":"First time going to Cafe Rio. The place is pretty big and has a lot of seating. When you walk in, you have the drink station along with your utensils and to go lids. Which I thought was pretty cool so that way it makes it easier for customers. The menu is pretty clear and up front. Pictures are the best! We noticed that they have someone making the tortilla fresh. That definitely deserves a star. The guy who helped us was nice and helpful. He recommended the habanero sauce on the enchiladas. It was delicious! Not as spicy as I thought it would be but the flavor is great. I got the shredded chicken and cheese. It wasn't too dry and the sauce just made it better. You have a choice of pinto or black beans and sour cream is extra. We also ordered a side of chips, guacamole and salsa. The salsa was more spicier then the habanero sauce lol but it was good. Chips are served warm. Wasn't too big of a fan of their horchata. Tasted like just regular milk with some cinnamon. So creamy and it didn't satisfy my taste buds. Good selection on side sauces. I'm pretty excited to try the tacos next time. This place is like a chipotle but on another level. Happy eating my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio is by our house and we used to eat here all of the time. Loved it. Now? HATE it. We went tonight for dinner after not eating here for a couple of months because the service was so bad. The service tonight was even worse!  We walk in thinking we'll have our food in about 5ish minutes, as there were only about seven people in front of us and two were ready to pay. Fast forward over TWENTY minutes later, and our order was finally taken. They were understaffed, and the employees could have given two craps less about the job they were doing. Once we finally got our food, we couldn't even sit down because every table in the place was dirty even though there were only about three full tables in the entire restaurant! We had to clean one ourselves.   Not only was the service horrendous, but the food is only subpar at best now. The rice at this location is always cooked improperly now. How hard is it to cook rice?!?! Try taking a bite into half cooked rice and almost breaking your teeth on rice that is not cooked at all and hard as a rock. Not yummy, that's for sure. And tonight, my flour tortilla for my taco might as well have been a crunchy corn tortilla. It was as hard as a rock! It was terrible.  We are DONE with this Cafe Rio. Such a shame that they let it go so downhill."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how amazing Lisette is. I'm sick and came in with my baby (with a carrier) for some tortilla soup. Lisette was so kind and thoughtful to help me carry my tray, get me silverware, and fill up my drink. I didn't even ask. She offered. That is amazing customer service and she deserves to be recognized. What a difference that has made in my day"}
{"text":"We came back after avoiding this place for about six months because their service was lacking. That was not the case last night. It was very busy and They were efficient and moved the line through quickly.  I am wondering if they changed management because we were impressed and enjoyed our experience.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Big fan of the flour tortillas.  Yummy.  The cheese in the tacos is maybe a little overboard, but tasty.  I wish there was a smaller option for chips / guac for a single person dining alone.  Shredded Chicken is awesome.  The sweet pork was... too sweet for me.  Love the salsas and the salad dressing stuff.  Wish you had fried fish tacos all the time.  Ok BIG pet peeve.... the singing is juvenile.  This shouldn't be a Chuck-E-Cheese or Applebees.  Knock that off.  Its embarrassing to us professional food snobs and makes me not want to be there when it happens.  Please reconsider that.  Its degrading to the employees too imo.    I really wanted to give a 1 or 2 based on the singing alone."}
{"text":"OMG!  After months of driving past Cafe Rio without stopping, we finally stopped in and ate.  Wish we had done it sooner!  Fresh wonderful food!  We went back two days in a row.  Fresh food, clean premises, great tastes!  Cross between fast food and traditional Mexican restaurant, but wonderful.  To bad they don't have a bar on premises.  We give them 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Their sweet pork burrito, enchilada style is ridiculously good. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I make every effort to visit this place at least twice in my 3-4 day trip. I wish they would open up in Houston. Now I just need this place to open up now as I'm waiting outside :)"}
{"text":"It took over 40 minutes to get our food with on 3 people I n front of. Very disorganized and there were at least 15 employees. They need new management."}
{"text":"Good food, but be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes in line. There are typically 20 or more people in line and if it takes one minute to prepare a meal and cash out, well you can do the math. They seem to work as fast as they can, but standing 30 minutes for food is not fun."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food...but not just any Mexican food, I love Mexican food done with an American twist. Cafe Rio is the pinnacle of Mexican American food for me. I frequent this place at least once a week. You can't go wrong with the quesadillas, salads, or tostadas. Salads...what?! The salads are served on a delicious handmade tortilla and filled with rice, beans, a meat of your choice, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the pork barbacoa. It is the perfect balance of savory and sweet. I could eat it by the pound, but usually I just get it on my tostada. The house dressing and the vinaigrette are both delicious choices for a salad or tostada. This place is fast and runs like a well oiled machine. They also have a punch card and after 10 punches you get a free meal! The best part is that you won't feel like you just ate fast food after you gorge yourself on the deliciousness that is Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"Friday night special with the sweet pork is our favorite. Feels like an assembly line sometimes but the food is great."}
{"text":"Really ! A 40 minute wait just to order!!!! We've been in line 40 minutes and even with people getting irritated and leaving the line it's still ridiculous."}
{"text":"Wow. The audacity of the employees to talk crap about their customer in Spanish while they're serving you. Yeah, I'm sorry. I only have been to this place twice. And I don't plan on ever returning. If your employees would like to insult your paying customers like we don't understand what you're saying, I hope you start to quickly lose business.   As for the food. I'm so upset that I can't even stomach my over priced Mexican food."}
{"text":"Good. Better than chipotle any day. I like their shredded chicken in any form they have, quesadilla, taco, salad.. list goes on.   Hat creamy cilantro sauce is  fire."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Everything's fresh real homemade tasting wholesome ingredients. Tortillas are made right there in front of you from scratch. You will not believe this place I was dumbfounded. Also make sure you try the horchata. Wasn't a big fan but it's there again made with all real ingredients real sugar. It's excellent!"}
{"text":"Where do I start??first I was excited to try the new Chile roast beef burrito ,and they were out ,ok I went ahead and got another meat and asked for mild sauce they were out ,ok next I ordered enchilada style ,they just passed it thru the stove not even long enough to melt the cheese ,as I'm waiting to pay (yes I still was willing to eat here) a young black woman who made my order is poking her finger in the meats trying to taste which ones the best to make herself a plate ,they were out of lettuce and the cook brings out a bucket of lettuce in water and puts it on my order still dripping wet ,finally I sit to eat and somewhat enjoy my meal only to bite into hard rice!!!when I tell the manager she says cafe Rios rice is supposed to be hard ...w...t...f I'm mexican and I always cook rice I think I know if rice is under cooked so I just asked for a refund and went on my way so not worth it !!!this location fell off do ur self a favor and go somewhere else plz"}
{"text":"Awful experience! Messed my boyfriend's order up TWICE. Couldn't answer simple questions about the food or function on a line at all. Rude when asked questions and rude when called out about being wrong. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this restaurant since it under went changes. A couple months ago I placed an online order and when we showed up 30 minutes later, they had no queso for our order and told us it would be an additional 20 minutes wait. We decided to give the restaurant another try tonight and we placed an order at 7:15 for a 7:45 pickup. When we arrived at 7:45 no one knew we had placed an order (they printed the ticket while we were standing there) and told us it would be another 15-20 minutes because they were out of queso and our food had not been made. The worst part of the experience is that the manager would not step up and tell us our food was not made, they made the poor cashier who was slammed, stop what he was doing, and come over and tell us.  I'm not sure if it's under new management or what but you need to work on your customer service."}
{"text":"I love the food but the service is horrible. Stood here for 5 min while 7 employees screwed around behind the counter and no one even acknowledged our existence. I was the only one in line and no one even said hi."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Rio establishments in the past however I had not been to this location in over 6 months. I was eager for the Steak Burrito!  The restaurant itself was very empty on Sunday, 6pm, which was kind of nice for a quick take out grab-n-go. I got the steak burrito with a wheat tortilla and medium sauce, black beans, cheese inside. It was put through there over warming machine and it was wrapped up and packaged quick.  I live less then 5 mins away and while I didn't expect it to be super hot I also didn't expect it to be room temperature.  Overall, i ate the whole thing but certainly was not impressed with the quality of the food itself. I recall it was better in the past so not sure whats changed. Ive decided I wont be returning anytime soon.  3 stars for service, speed, and cost but I'd say 2 for quality of food."}
{"text":"The food is good, getting your food is a different story. I figured I would order on line for easy pick up, I scheduled pick up at 11:15, waited until 12 noon, I would have been better off waiting in line. Customer Service is not good either."}
{"text":"Food Was Great As Always !!! Sofia (Sofie) & Ms.Cloe Are The Best Great. Always Make You Feel So Welcomed They Both Have Great Customers Service."}
{"text":"Always great place to eat with kids and if your on a diet. They have different verity of salads, tacos and burritos. Employees are very nice also. Great to get a quick bite to eat thank you cafe rio !!!"}
{"text":"Came by today with my bestie for a bite to eat. Line moved quickly but towards the end when we got to the front to pay, was when the situation became uncomfortable. There was a new hire on cashier and she looked nervous, we patiently waited for her to ring us up, no biggie. The \"lead associate\" was barking orders at her, to take her gloves off, get the chips, don't do this or that, obviously made the newbie uncomfortable and even more nervous. My bestie and I looked at each other and this poor girl, and felt terrible. I decided I couldn't let it go when I got home, and called to speak to the store manager;who was on her lunch. I explain d the story, and she was very apologetic and assured us that she would have the appropriate talks with staff. She didn't seem like she was giving us a generic answer just to get off the phone. I appreciate the manager for taking time to work with us and not give me the scripted \"I'll take care of it\" response. Great staff and an excellent manager at this store!"}
{"text":"I never heard of Cafe Rio before I moved to Vegas, but I am so glad I have discovered this yummy place! I am a huge fan of the barbacoa quesadilla! The portions of meat and cheese are very generous. I have never had any problems with the food or employees here. I love that I can call in my order and walk right up to the register, pay and leave in no time. Try the barbacoa!!!"}
{"text":"average. Big portions. Great tortillas, chicken good quality. Salsa was unimpressive. Happy staff. will go again because they allowed my dog to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"The girl who was helping me was distracted. I asked for steak burrito. During that time another coworker came up to her and basically called her out for doing something wrong (which should have never been done in front of a customer.) So she asked me if I want enchilada style where the sauce goes on top. I said no. 2 seconds later she pours sauce all over the burrito. I said \"I said no sauce\" and she nodded her head and continued to drench the burrito in sauce. I said \"honey, I said no sauce.\" Then she figured it out. She made a new burrito and put cheese in it without even asking me if I wanted cheese. Again. Distracted.  I don't like that they don't wrap the burrito like most places do, marking in impossible to hold. I don't want to eat a burrito with a fork! I could have gotten a bowl if I wanted that.   The steak was tasteless. I don't like that they don't put any veggies in the burrito. Lettuce, tomatoe, etc.. They put it in the side? I didn't want a salad but whatever.   I paid close to $14 for one burrito and drink which is insanely expensive for a pretty bland meal and an unpleasant first experience.  Do yourselves a favor and go down the street to Chronic Tacos. You won't regret it. I regret coming here instead of going to Chronic. But now I know!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Expect to wait in line for a while if you come in for lunch hour and or dinner. Their ingredients are always fresh and top quality. The staff is always friendly and tries their best to move the line rapidly. The salads and burritos are their specialties. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time visiting and the food was very Good! I like that they offer daily meal specials and reasonably priced kids items. The atmosphere is her modern and clean. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I've had Cafe Rio several times and all were well, until yesterday (5/4). I was charged extra for 2oz of rice I never received nor did I order. I was also charged for 'double' cheese when the employee put the wrong cheese on the first time. My original $8 + change and tax meal turned into almost $14. I'll be sure to watch more carefully next time when my food is being made."}
{"text":"The guests in front of us literally walked out due to the lady behind the counters attitude and the fact they were out of grilled chicken. I thought he seemed a bit irrational. I was wrong. The lady behind the counter seemed annoyed we were there and they were actually out of all kinds of chicken and steak. We had the options of pork. They were also out of queso. Still an hour till closing. We frequent this location frequently and are never impressed. Today was the absolute worst."}
{"text":"I love me some Cafe Rio! Tortillas are always fresh, cooked on the spot.. cant go wrong with that! Love the mint limeaid and tortilla soup! Im only giving 4 stars because the tables and areas could be cleaned more often.. tables outside dirty most days."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 4 stars This establishment is clean but not spotless, the restrooms have a clean appearance but a small odor to it. The outdoor dining area doesn't have a trash can and people seem to just leave their waste on the tables.  Hospitality: 4 Stars The employees were kind, and made eye contact while I placed my order. However, it appears they are understaffed or lacked leadership as most were quick to the point with customers but openly joking amongst one another at the expense of the customer.   Food: 3 stars Consistent with quality, and flavor. Only draw back is the food isn't as good for take out. The dishes seem to get cold fast and needed to be reheated.   Overall: 4 stars Be prepared to be patient in line, and double check your order. The food is worth some of the shenanigans that seem to be normal with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is my favorite place to eat. I used to drive all the way to Vegas just to be able to eat there before they started building them in Arizona. The day I checked in at this location the line was long (as always) but they were also getting orders mixed up on the line. I was in line for almost half an hour. I should utilize the order ahead feature but by the time I'm ready to eat it's already too late. I hope this location can learn to get a little better at organization."}
{"text":"Good food is only part of the experience. We have been coming to this location for years and as of late the service has fallen flat! No one smiles and everyone looks and acts like they are offended that people are in the building and ordering food, and don't date asking for anything in addition to what you ordered like extra plates. There are other places that we can get food from and significantly better service."}
{"text":"I liked this place untill I showed up around 3:30 ish pm, it was my first time going at that time and every single staff member was rude , just because I asked for a wheat tortilla and so along the line,I had a 2 for 1 cupon and they didn't seem to like this neither, if I really have to go back it would be in the morning ,they are nicer at this time,different shift different people."}
{"text":"The food still tastes good, hence the two stars, but the customer service is always poor aside from one member they have on staff that seems to actually enjoy what they do. From what I've noticed, a lot of what they do is not up to health code. They change out their bins of food every few hours like they're suppose to, but then dump in the old food on top of the new food. If they do this all day long, and then store that food over night, the food they're storing is not having the correct expiration date and not being disposed of properly when it should be. They also had cleaning products that should be stored on a chemical rack, laying around on top of their prep tables where they prep food, I've also noticed they'll go from cleaning something to going right back and preparing food without changing their gloves. Also, the lobby is always disgusting when we come in. We have to clean our own tables before we sit down. They definitely need some new management, and I'm not entirely sure how they still have an A rating from the health district. Unless they haven't had a health inspection in quite awhile."}
{"text":"NO ONE LISTENS!!!! Look at the customer. Pay attention. Listen. Turn down the bloody music if you can't hear me. Clean!!! Clean the tray racks. Clean the molding. FIRE the manager. This place is so poorly run that it screams intervention."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now and both times I left extremely disappointed. I keep hearing great things about it, but I just don't get why.  The counter that you have to order from is so high I couldn't even see over it, so when they're standing there just looking at me waiting for me to tell them what ingredients I wanted, I didn't have a clue what the options were! I know I'm only 5'3\", but come on, this is ridiculous, a lot of people are my height.  The people making the bowl/wraps didn't even speak English well enough to answer the 97 questions that I had. So I eventually gave up asking.  Then the sticker shock comes when my total is almost $15 for just me!  To top it all off, I finally sit down to a sticky table and crumb filled seat, only to look at my order for the first time (now that it's not hiding behind what feels like a 9 foot prison wall) to find what can honestly be a bowl of 50% lettuce! Seriously? I went through this stress and paid an hourly wage for a bowl of lettuce with tiny drops of who-knows-what sprinkled throughout?  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Cafe Rio, I'm not allowing you a third strike... Zabbas, here I come!"}
{"text":"Service last 2 visits very slow. Today ice machine and soda fountain out of service. Staff did not handle the situation very well. Basically expected people to eat there and not have a drink. Not even have water bottles available."}
{"text":"Come here at least one a week for dinner, love that they have a punch card if you buy 10 meals you get a free meal.. I have tried everything but love their shrimp tacos only on Tuesdays and their fired grilled chicken salad is really good."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for fast, fresh Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Big portions, quick service (unless you get there at peak lunch hours and have to wait in a horrendous line), clean, and very nice employees (not sure why other Yelpers had issues with them??).    I love their plain cheese quesadillas--I always ask for extra guacamole and get a side of rice/black beans for some extra protein; unfortunately, they charge the same price for a cheese or meat quesadilla, so being veggie, I always get the meat on the side and give it to one of my meat-eating friends.  Friends and family LOVE the salad dressing.  I also really like the key lime pie for dessert (although my hubby says it's way too sweet).  Make sure to pick up one of their stamp cards--you get a free meal when you buy ten.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I have to say Cafe Rio makes pretty good food to me I like it I rather eat there then Chipotle and get sick. The price of the food is not worth it if they lowered the menu by a few dollars at least make it feel like I'm not getting ripped off and nickel and dimed. They need to give bigger portions as far as meat sour cream and guacamole."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love cafe rio. Most of the locations I've been to, especially the one near UNLV and the one on eastern, have always been good. This is my second time here at this location and I will never come back to this place.   Reason why is because when I tried to order my usual salad, they weren't able to put the coconut shrimp on it because they could only put that on tacos. Honestly, it's not a big deal to me. But when you tell me it's against the policy to put shrimp in a non taco form even when I INSISTED on paying for it on the side.. That's so freaking absurd!! I've been and dined in cafe rio plenty of times and not once have I heard this kind of policy! There were no signs indicating it at all. When I couldn't get my coconut shrimp, I asked for steak.. Then they told me it wasn't ready and they still have to cook it. There were no people at the restaurant and you still have to prepare steak?  After 7-8 minutes, I finally received my salad. The staff, overall,  looked to dumbfounded besides the cashier. She was nice lol.   Ugh I don't know about you guys but based on the reviews here as well, this location is a joke. You're better off going to the Robertos across the street."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food, awesome customer service, good drink selection, and the best tortillas!!  Family friendly with a great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"The first time I had Cafe Rio, I didn't care much for it. I think I got the grilled chicken in my burrito and it was too chunky for me. After giving it a second shot, I tried the shredded chicken burrito (enchilada style, of course). DELICIOUS! I'm from Cali, where I was able to get delicious wet burritos from practically anywhere. This is about close as close to home as I've gotten. Also, I will say from a super Mexican standpoint, their horchata is amazing! Not my mama's, but still delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing to get too excited about. I had the steak taco and the flavor was just ok.  I have to say, the service here wowed me more than the food. I placed the order online (super easy) and it was ready exactly when I requested. Overall, I'll probably stick to Chipotle for a quick  Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, Café Rio? I can't remember the last time I craved a salad... but you've made me love lettuce like no other. Of course, once you fill a tin with a warm, chewy tortilla, rice, beans, marinated chicken and some famous lime cilantro dressing--how could you not love the lettuce you pile on top so generously? The chicken breast salad at Café Rio has more flavor than most 4 course meals. It's refreshing, filling and will make your taste buds shake their maracas. I've also had a chicken quesadilla, also delicious, and bites of Mike's enchiladas and burritos. We also love their queso and chips and love to get an extra freshly made tortilla to dip in the queso. Their tortillas are divine. Thick and chewy, always warm and perfectly cooked.  If there was a drawback to this place, it wouldn't be the food, but the crazy people that scream at you for your order. I always feel a bit rushed getting through the line and making sure you got what you want. They're quick to move onto the next person (because there's always a line--sign of a good place!) and if you're not careful, you'll be left in the dust.  Overall, their food makes up for any of the customer service issues. We've been to a couple of locations and always have a good meal. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some casual Mexican dining."}
{"text":"I gave it one star cuz I had to give it something. I placed my online order for 7:15 pick up. It's 7:49 I'm still waiting now in line as people have done in and out and I'm still waiting. Never again."}
{"text":"Don't order for pick up... it's definitely not the same! Plain tortilla with chicken, and cheese just thrown on it, not at all like I get when dining in. Will only be eating at the restaurant from now on if I return."}
{"text":"This place looked nice and some friends told me to try it. Very unfriendly staff and I asked about the price in the end. I thought it was wrong, guess I have to squint and read the fine print on the menu. The ask you of you would like cheese and sauce on your burrito but when they ask they dont tell you it's an up-charge. The cashier made it a point to walk over to the menu and point the small print out to me. RUDE!!!."}
{"text":"I was so happy cafe rio was in summerlin. First day I go there with my son and the girls for my order all wrong. Kids quesadilla and a salad but ok first week opening I figured they are new but the one girl who finishes the orders before the cashier has the worst attitude ever!!!!!! I love the food so I come again a few weeks later. Same girl same stink attitude!! Cashier was rude too. So I love the food but I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"Rude, unwelcoming staff! One lady threw an enormous handful of lettuce on my daughter's kids meal without asking what we would like or even saying so much as a word to me actuallu; then proceeded to have major attitude when I kindly asked her to prepare a different one after my daughter was upset she ruined her dish. We ordered tacos which were disturbingly blan, even with tons of hot sauce! Then I find out my total is $30.99 (insanely overpriced!) Paid it because I was starving. Over course they overcharged me for an extra drink I did not request or get. Chipotle is WAY tastier and literally 1/2 the price!!!"}
{"text":"We went there last night for the first time and we weren't overly impressed. While the pork was good, there were quite a few customer service issues during our visit. As someone who can't eat flour tortillas due to a food sensitivity it was very disappointing to hear that they didn't have any corn tortillas made at 5pm on a Sat. Especially since they have menu items that are listed as being served in a corn tortilla, including that night's special! A man behind the counter who I assume was the manager was very proud to tell the line of customers that their tortillas are made fresh unlike the Chipotle across the street. But, I've always been able to get a corn tortilla when I asked for one at Chipotle. The order line seem very unorganized and my husband had to tell the same employee four times that he wanted rice & beans beacause she wasn't paying attention the 1st three times! When we got to the cashier we had to wait because no one else behind the counter seemed to notice that cashier was on the phone & a line was forming. It may be awhile before we give this location another try."}
{"text":"Oh man, I am a happy camper since finding this place! My mouth is drooling just thinking about their homemade flour tortillas, made fresh right in front of your eyes *dying*...and with me being a picky eater I love how you can see the food being prepared in front of me; that way I know what I am getting and I know it's made accurately.   The chile roasted beef is to die for. It tastes like a pot roast that has been slow-cooking all day at Grandma's house. Just add in some cheese, veggies and a side of pico and you have yourself heaven in a aluminum takeaway container (which is awesome by the way). If you can't finish your dish just throw on a lid and you're good to go.   I recently ordered the queso dip and it was stellar, their chips are delish and I'd have to say my favorite dish are the tacos right now. Oh and get this - order any adult entrée and get a free kids quesadilla for your little munchkin. Say what? That's right....FREE food. How awesome is that?  It does get super busy here and that's my only gripe....but hey, they're serving awesome food, can you blame them? No. Soooo much better than Chipotle. They're popping up like crazy around the valley so do yourself a favor and check them out."}
{"text":"I am SO obsessed with this place. The tortillas are amaaaaazing, and definitely exceeded my expectations. I love their burritos, but with the habanero hatch chili pork.   Their salads are delicious with their cilantro vinaigrette dressing, which is my preference over the other creamy house dressing.   Service is fast, prices are reasonable, and hay burrito enchilada style is sooooo worth trying.   I could probably eat this almost everyday!!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously understaffed.  Slow service. Lots of employees moving around but the front line which should be serving customers is being ignored.  No one seems to care..."}
{"text":"Everything tastes so fresh. Delicious and close! Taco Tuesdays, here we come!! They have veggie available for any style. Fast warm and tasty. I tried the green chili pork in an enchilada. Yum"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Extremely fresh. Tops the chain by far, the taco salad was awesome, the tacos were great. Fresh squeezed lime on most dishes a nice touch"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the lack of customer service at this location. It's a good thing that I love the food, otherwise I would have given less stars. If you're in a rush,  be prepared to wait,  even if you call in your order ahead of time."}
{"text":"My friend recommended cafe rio to me and when my mom and I were looking for something new to try we decided to give it a go. We went about 8:30 Saturday night.  There were maybe 10 people in line, 2 people sitting eating.  My first impression was how disgusting the place was,  which was really surprising given it's a fairly new place . We looked for a clean table to sit so we could look at the menu, when we couldn't find a clean table we reluctantly sat at a dirty table.  There was a girl on the floor,  but she seemed to not notice her tables or floors were dirty.  Instead she was sampling the different beverages. perhaps she was on break?  There was a sign that said daily special for Sunday.  I asked the girl if that was the special for the day,  she looked at me like I was crazy and said no it's for Sunday. So I pressed her for the special for today and she simply answered shrimp. I asked all shrimp and irritated she said shrimp tacos.  My mom suggested maybe they were closing and that's why it was gross and disorganized,  but according to the door they were open til 11.   So thoroughly a bad experience,  with no movement in the line we made the decision to leave and not eat there.  Drove up to senior taco and was not disappointed, if you want good food go there (burrito chimi style is so good and worth the drive!)"}
{"text":"I've gone to this location at 8pm about 3 times they are so rude and don't welcome you on arrival they don't even say hi they just say what would you like with no eye contact the whole time they don't listen to what you say an just agree my order is always fucked up and when I tell them they look at me like I'm stupid. The black girl at the front of the line was the worst!"}
{"text":"It won't let me give NEGATIVE stars! If you wanted their shrimp tacos today you had be there before 5pm. Also they ran out of rice. If this was the only time this happened I wouldn't be writing this negative review. This is the WORST cafe rio I know of. It's the only one that consistently runs out of food at an early hour. This happens so much that I will take the extra 10 minutes and go to the centenial center location. Really! This place sucks! No planning! How they stay in business is beyond me. It forced me to put one star to post this review."}
{"text":"Tip: get cafe rio to go. Get the mango lime drink and then take it home and add a shot or two of tequila! Makes for an easy margarita. :)"}
{"text":"Only on worker worth anything. I've been here for 45 min and I had to wait in line, watched this girl Jessica make all the orders in front of me then the white guy makes her go do other things while someone else stepped in her place. Then that lady messed up the order and the customers behind my order. I see several workers on break with a line. That's not good. The white guy is just taking to the other workers and wasn't even listening to me I repeated myself three times to even get his attention then I still didn't get what I wanted. Then I see Jessica cleaning the front while the some of the others,,,,,, ( the ones not on break bc there was at least two I could see eating and one girl walked into the bathroom. You have a lot of employees here and I couldn't see why, let's get back to what I was saying.....) were just standing in a circle talking about stupid shit.  Anyways the food is okay and it's kinda close to home. I'll be back bc this wasn't the first experience I've had here so thanks..."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio location is giving this amazing chain a horrible rep!! I've been frequenting Cafe Rios for years, starting with the original in Utah...but today's experience left me never wanting to return. Disorganization, long wait, and sub par flavor!! I just wanted a chicken soup...35 mins in line watching several employees running around, stumbling over each other, asking each other questions they can't answer and I finally have my soup that is cold and lacking it's usual flavor. What gives??? Hopefully the Cafe Rio powers that be will get smart soon and help this floundering joint!!! HELP!!!"}
{"text":"This is generous. Can't figure out why so crowded. The food is marginal at best. The flour tortillas are good...that's it.  Was looking forward to another option to Chipotle, this isn't it"}
{"text":"The worst cafe rio I have ever been to. Came here at 8:30 and there were two people in front of us in line. Took us 20 minutes for the whole process. Then, we go to fill up our drinks and a worker is on his hands and knees cleaning the drain. Doesn't say a word when we come up to fill our cups up. Just keeps cleaning. Literally had to work around him. We got the chips and guacamole that cost $6. It was 3 skimpy scoops. Then I'm eating my salad and find a thick black hair in it... TWICE. The girl who made my salad has thick black hair. I'm so disgusted by this whole place. Never will come here again."}
{"text":"The best place to go & get a wonderful Salmon salad. I love their tortillas & all the food"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious but regardless of if you order In store or over the phone there is alway a wait even if you show up 20 minutes after the time they tell you your food will be ready for pick up."}
{"text":"I have become a Cafe Rio addict after years of passing and ignoring I finally tried it.  I love this particular location which is Amazing as I have been to both Sahara locations and had horrible experiences.  They are fresh, delicious, filling and reasonable.  They have great options, burritos, quesadillas, tacos, tostadas, and taco salad. They also have a standard daily special with a non menu item.  I tried the coconut shrimp taco special on Tuesday, mmmm yum yes delicious!  The burritos are HUGE and is really two meals!  The staff is super friendly at this location and I am devoted to this location only!  They have Amazing desserts! I really enjoy the keylime tart and tres leches strawberry cake it is so good.  If you complete the survey on your receipt than dessert is FREE on your next visit.  We have eaten here so many times that the staff recognizes us and is always sweet and welcoming.  This group of staff is super fun and nice, they are the Super Stars getting all of us hungry customers through the line.  The process is easy, decide on what you want, burrito, tacos, enchiladas etc. Then you pick a meat, chicken, asada, sweet pork, salmon etc. They build it for you as you like it, rice, beans, etc.  We are on the late freight in trying Cafe Rio, we had been missing out this whole time!  The food is delicious and is generous for a good price. You won't leave here hungry!"}
{"text":"Love their green chili burrito. They have quick service and a nice family friendly atmosphere. My kids always love going here"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Cafe Rio I have ever been to and unfortunately it's around the corner from my house so I've been here a few times.  Every time I hope it will be better, but it's not. There isn't a friendly employee that works here, the specialty drink containers are always empty and the food lacks the flavor that the other locations offer and it's always cold.  I believe this horrible service starts  from the top and trickles down and the owner of this franchise needs to be forced to sell or step up his/her game. If this was the only Cafe Rio I had ever tried, I would never return and tell everyone I know not to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm SO happy to finally have a Cafe Rio on this side of town!  I like the fresh new look and service has been good.  I do however miss the days when all the employees would welcome you with a big loud \"Welcome\" shout and excitedly yell out \"FREE MEAL\".  That was fun but seems to be forgotten.  The food is on par with the Eastern location (best Cafe Rio in Vegas).  This location is missing the stevia strawberry lemonade which is a great option for us sugar free folk.  Loving this convenient location."}
{"text":"The PORK...oohhhh the PORK!!  It's finger lickin' deeeeelicous!!!  I had a pork taco salad and the cilantro vinaigrette was by far my most favorite vinaigrette yet.  My husband LOVED his pork quesadilla and the kids enjoyed a cheese quesadilla and a pork tostada thing.  Everything was SO good and I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"1st time at Cafe Rio and I have to say this was a good choice. The set up is very much like Chipotle. So I settled for the Habanero Chicken Burrito and the wife got the Grilled Steak Burrito.  You most definitely get your moneys worth with the amount of food you get. I'm still trying to figure out who gets any appetizers and a meal. That's how much food you get when you order. I guess maybe if you just got an appetizer and nothing else. If you like Chipotle then you will like this place. Good food, friendly staff. This is a must stop if you've never been here before. Got to try it at least once."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting cafe rio for 18 years!  I love this place- the barbacoa pork salad and burrito are my faves!  Their house made tomatillo ranch dressing is probably the best salad dressing in the world!  Not to mention the drink bar, Horchata is fantastic, the mint lemonade is to die for and so many other choices. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great, you can't beat this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Rio (located in the same shopping center as Costco on Decatur) on a Friday afternoon, around 4pm. I flew into LV that morning and had just spent over three hours waiting at the DMV down the street, so I was really ready to eat anything. The restaurant has a pretty large space, but I feel like they really packed in the tables. Thank goodness it wasn't busy that afternoon. Since I was there during the day, there was a whole lot of natural light coming in through the windows, so it was nice and bright. The music was alright, but a little more solemn than I prefer, but whatevs. I honestly can't imagine being here late night if it's busy. It would probably be really crowded, dim and loud with all the chattering and the music..   There were a lot of drink choices (I just drank water, though): Strawberry lemonade, mint limeade, southwest limeade, and Horchata (which most people go crazy over).   I ordered a sweet pork enchilada with medium hot sauce, black beans, tomatoes, lettuce and rice. The pork was too sweet. The medium sauce that came with my order was not hot at all and was totally masked by the sweetness of the pork. There were a lot of additional hot sauces available on the counter with the utensils and napkins. A LOT. I tried putting more on my enchilada, but I didn't taste a satisfying difference.   The service and food prep was super fast. They put the meat on the enchilada, folded it, put sauce on top and threw on the beans, lettuce, tomatoes and rice. The add-ons were nice, but presentation could have been better. I mean, they literally just throw it in your tray. I didn't feel that the enchilada and the experience were worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"FAVORITE RESTAURANT!!! They have the kindest staff, and a clean restaurant. Many options, and choices for food as well. I feel like I can go here no matter what I crave because of the many options. Portion sizes are good! I usually have a little bit left over. The sweet pork and shredded chicken are really good. My favorite meal here is the burrito. I get sweet pork, black beans, rice, mild sauce, and I get it enchilada style!!! soooo yum!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, great and fresh. The wait is a little long - but worth it if you aren't in a hurry. Beats chipotle hands down."}
{"text":"my wife just came back home with our food and after a long line and wait still a mess up with our food this is not the first time its many times this is gettin ridiculous always messing up and we paid 37 dollars for a burrito and 2 quesadillas like thats more then restaurants and still they always mess up i ordered a burrito half chicken and steak with queso inside rice beans and veggies and to make it enchilada style with red sauce and rice and lettuce tomato on the side didnt even get half that right these people just gave me steak and rice and lettuce and the red sauce and the quesadillas we asked for guacamole on top didnt even get it and paid for it and worse part is my wife told me she kept trying to fix there mistakes and tell them what we wanted but they kept move everything around not focusing on what she was saying thats why there very unorganized kept moving stuff around from 3 people in front of her to 2 behind her they didnt even know what her order was so she had to tell them again and give her attitude like we are paying the price and we get attitude for there mistake this will be the last time we buy from here it got to out of hand we kept coming back because there chciken and steak is very good and queso but for the amount of money and mistakes they do ill be much happier at chipotle and so should everyone else get your employees in check and get more organized"}
{"text":"The food is ok at best. Personally I think it's a bit over priced for Mexican food since there's better options if you're looking for Mexican fast food in Vegas."}
{"text":"This rating is just for the food, which is almost always good. This Cafe Rio has changed a lot since I left for college in 2011. I used to crave Cafe Rio when I was at school and it was always my first or last stop coming home or leaving. That's not the case here any more.   Since I left for school they expanded and bought the space next door to expand their seating area. Either I come in at the wrong times or this place is always almost empty. It always used to be packed! What happened?  Here's a hint: it's the staff. I used to feel welcomed here but now the employees act like it's a chore for them to do their jobs. Going down the line today the first guy almost got my mom's order wrong, the middle lady was extremely slow, and the cashier was straight up rude. When I asked her for an order of chips and queso she said \"You have to ask her (referring to the slow lady) for the chips and queso.\" Excuse me? Last time I checked you're the one who asks if I would like any drinks or chips. As I turned to the lady to ask the cashier turned around and began talking to her friend who was wiping down trays. Seriously? And she kept talking to her friend while we were at the counter waiting for our food! That is a big no no in a customer service job. She was even still talking to her friend when she gave my mom her receipt! Really girl? Your conversation was that important that you completely ignored us for most of the transaction and was still rude? You've got a lot of nerve.   Bottom line, the food is good but don't expect good customer service."}
{"text":"Wow.  Thank you so much for having the most delicious Mexican food around. Left craving more.  Definitely will be making this a routine stop.  It is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant I've been to across the country.  Can't be beat.  The tortillas-freshly made.  Fresh pico. Yum. Fast service and friendly.  Clean"}
{"text":"i went to happy valley branch. it's definitely bigger than the camelback branch. i ordered the sweet pork barbacoa burrito and it's quite good however, i kinda hoping that they will serve it a bit spicy. i like their cheese dip for their tortilla chips.  if you are new to this place, ordering might need a little getting used to. the ordering is not like chipotle.   also take note that any sides that you ask...they do charge 50 cents."}
{"text":"My roommate would die for a Cafe Rio steak burrito, so when he got to pick where we had lunch, it was a no brainer for him. Cafe Rio it was!  I had never been to this location, but it's super close to my house and has a huge parking lot, so that's a win. The venue is huge with lots of colorful tables and chairs. Seating wasn't an issue on a Sunday afternoon, but I'm not sure I could say the same thing for a weekday since it's right across the street from UNLV.  The service and food her are A-OK in my book. They make their tortillas from scratch and they are fantastic. I went for the grilled chicken burrito. You add your fillings as you go and they build it for you. Black beans, rice, meat or veggies of your choice and their salsa/sauce selection is on point. I went for the tomatillo sauce inside and on top and finished the enchilada style with their hot red sauce before they added the cheese and put it through the toasting warmer.  The service was friendly but a bit confusing and chaotic. I wasn't offered any extras and had to ask them to go back and add guacamole and their house dressing. Have you had their house dressing? It's almost like a ranch on steroids. A must have for all of your dipping pleasures."}
{"text":"I love this place. Chipotle who? The food is really good and the fresh tortillas are everything. I'm also addicted to the mint lemonade which is so freaking good. I'm so happy I gave this place a try twice in a week lol"}
{"text":"The lines are ridiculous and even on-line order is challenging when picking up my food as there is only one available cashier.    The food is not bad, but it's definitely not authentic.  For the price point, I think I'll stick with Chipotle.  It's a family environment, always loud, always busy.  I think it has to do with the variety of options they have to offer.  Without the rewards loyalty that I found on the application, I probably wouldn't come back for a third time.  It's a frustrating process for mediocre food.  There is way more rice than meat ratio in my burrito. The guacamole has absolutely no taste.  I came, I tried and that's my take on it."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad.  About the same as Chipotle or maybe a notch higher.    But the staff are all over the place.  Seems like they have a few good apples mixed in with the bad.  One star for the grill cook with his pants halfway down his ass and his chonies sticking out, seriously dude your underwear is mere inches away from the food that customers put in their mouths.  It's actually disgusting to think about...good thing I didn't get the grilled steak.  More alarming than that is management apparently allows this?  Fairly large chain restaurant and they don't have dress code standards?  Full trash bags sitting on the floor in plain view of customers, waiting to be taken out.   Remember folks, this is the part of the restaurant they let you see.  There's an entire prep kitchen behind closed doors they *don't* let you see.    Register girl was weird.  No eye contact, no engagement, no \"Thanks\", nada.    Asylum being run by the inmates over here.  They need new/better management.  I keep wanting a good post workout meal near EOS and it still doesn't exist, I swear when Roberto's is your best option you know something's seriously wrong."}
{"text":"Nobody greeted me as I entered their empty restaurant. 2 hours before closing. As I approach to order, the lady helping me was talking to another employee in Spanish nearly the whole time I was getting my salad made. It was unprofessional of her since she failed to give me her undivided attention.   Also, it really was just too dirty in there for the amount of people on the clock and no body else but me in there. Management should've been on top of that, especially with the kitchen visible to paying customers.  Lousy staff. Lousy service. Dirty restaurant.  The food in all honestly wasn't bad, and it usually never is here. I enjoy cafe rios food. It was just the experience here that threw me off. And that in my opinion can make or break you. In this case, I won't be coming back to this location for Mexican food again."}
{"text":"Stood at the door, thinking we were going to be seated... but boy was I wrong. Luckily the server was nice enough to question if it was my first time and directed us to the ordering line.   Ordered a burrito and some nachos, which were delicious and were even put in the oven to heat up even more. Their foods are flavorful and the selection of additional \"hot sauces\" was a very nice touch.   Will definitely be back, but probably with a few friends since my bf and I couldn't finish either."}
{"text":"This isn't that good .my first time was Durango n 215 n it was the best. The guy that was taking orders sucked but the food made up for it. The cafe rio on Stephanie NOT so good.they wasn't very friendly either ."}
{"text":"I'm very upset with the staff they are putting stuff in my order with out asking me and there saying there quick no that's unacceptable for me she's putting normal cheese in my order when I asked for queso and she's like I'll just add it on top that's too much cheese now and they didn't offer to fix there mess up now I'm stuck with the food they made for me and I didn't order . Love the food but it the staff"}
{"text":"This is the first place that I'm going to review badly despite their amazing food. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to customer service with wait staff and restaurant employees... but this place is bad enough to make me a not-so-nice guy.   We've been here quite a few times and never once were treated satisfactory by the lackluster staff. Despite their tacos being some of the best amongst these Chipotle-like Mexican places... the service is horrible enough to make me not care.   Let me explain here...   First off, there isn't a single associate here that seems genuinely happy about being there. Some of them are yelling and singing stuff back and forth during busy times, but it seems like more of a gimmick than anything. On several occasions I've been met with snooty responses to simple questions... like this:  Me: \"Can I get salsa in my taco's please?\" Them: \"Uh, you want enchilada sauce in your tacos\" Me: \"No, I want salsa in my taco's.\" Them: \"You want Pico De Gallo in your taco's?\" Me: \"No, I want salsa in my taco's\"              *Points to Salsa container* Them: \"Uh\" *Blank look on face* Me: \"Ummmmmmm\" *Doesn't know what else to say* Them: \"So you want salsa in your taco's\" Me: \"Yeahhhhhhh\" Them: \"Ok\"            *Proceeds to scoop enchilada sauce into mini side cup and put on my tray.  Me: \"Eh\"             *Walks away without salsa, and gives up in shame*  ...this salsa misunderstanding is one of three times this has happened to me at Cafe Rio. I don't know how it's possible... but I think some of their staff don't know what salsa is. I feel like that should be a requirement for working at a Mexican restaurant, but apparently to the dunces behind the counter; all sauce which is red in color is the same thing.   On other occasions I've been given the wrong kind of meat, then all but yelled at when telling them it was wrong. They also gave my Mom shit once because she asked for corn taco's instead of flour. She has a food allergy and can't eat flour tortillas... but the guy behind the counter couldn't understand that and kept insisting that she should go with flour; while my poor Mom tried to defend and explain herself; I was there when it happened and it was f'ing weird.   All this, and to add to it their beloved 'Taco Tuesdays' here has become a sham. It started out being a dollar per taco which was a good deal, then they raised it to $1.50... which was questionable... they then raised it again to $2.00 per taco; which isn't even special. Six bucks for three tacos is pretty much regular price! I wonder if they just think people are stupid enough to go in and pay that without realizing the price isn't special at all. Additionally the regular prices are a bit higher than other similar options like Q'doba or Chipotle. It's also extra for some toppings which you can get for free at other places. I think they believe their food is good enough to excuse the higher prices and horrible service, but it most certainly isn't!   This place only gets two stars because their pork tacos are damn good, and their flour tortillas are pretty amazing. Other than the food though, this place fails on every level."}
{"text":"Ok, this is our 3rd, maybe 4th visit. When are you people going to get it together? So disappointed. Always in shambles. Trash overflowing, kitchen not kept up continusly. The drink station always a disaster with spilled soda on floor. I don't know if I can bring myself to visit again.... Frustrating......chain restaurants... ugh.."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking about my recent meal at Cafe Rio. I got a chicken salad and OMG!!! It is probably the best meal that I have ever had in my LIFE! It was so flavorful and fresh. The guacamole was amazing! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp tacos are the Tuesday special and they were out of the mango salsa that is paired with these tacos. No biggie to me as I prefer regular salsa. They make really good coconut shrimp tacos and I'm not a big fan of Cafe Rio but I make an exception for these. The portion size is very good for the price and the food is relatively consistent. I chose rice with no beans as my side and they gave me plenty of rice. Their salsa isn't hot enough for me, I need to ask if they have one that is caliente next time.  The meal came with a soda and the one I chose was flat. Yuck.  This place is usually pretty busy and that fast paced atmosphere is not for me. I'm not in a race to get my burrito, for Pete's sake. I also got a lime pie dessert which was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"My first visit here and I had the salmon tacos plate. The menus are on the walls where people wait so you are staring at the menu and people think you're staring at them. Bizarre. I was charged for chips but didn't order them and I think she tried to charge me for a side of dressing the other employee said comes with the salmon. Geez!  So that happened and the overcharge was quickly remedied. But now I'm soured on this place. The tacos were very good."}
{"text":"Was I not a lover of chili rellenos and coconut shrimp tacos, I'd probably never have come here. After my first visit at this location, it's doubtful I'll ever return. They were out of the chili rellenos when I went around 8 pm. Not too surprising, I guess! It's a daily special. I opted for the pork quesadilla instead, which was pretty good. I hate that they have like a 3 minute goal to get each customer through the line and out the door. I do like that I screw that goal up every time, since they usually forget something! They are visibly frustrated by this too. I asked for a side of salsa, and since that was forgotten, there goes the 3 minute goal for sure! The employees I interacted with were actually quite nice and I did get a free beverage, so points for that. I was offered the drink because they were out of the rellenos."}
{"text":"First time going to this new location and loved it! It was busy of course, but as always the line moved smoothly and efficiently. Food is delicious! Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! I just recently moved to this area and the place I'm from doesn't have a cafe rio so I was definitely interested in trying it. My favorite thing so far is enchiladas with the pork Barbacoa. Their queso dip is also amazing, way better than that garbage chipotle came up with. Guacamole is also really good. I also recommend the tomatillo dressing. My favorite drink is the mint limeade and it is perfect with the enchiladas. The only thing I don't love is they cost a little more than I'd like, but they're still worth it to have some really awesome food once in a while. I'd describe it as the same idea as chipotle but tastes a lot better, has more options (especially with types of sauce & drinks), and hasn't had multiple locations get people sick. This particular location (haven't gone to other ones yet as this one is closest to me and more convenient) each time I've been there it has been clean, no trash laying around, and in general appears quite sanitary. The employees have been friendly, quick, and take care to make sure everything is sanitary and orders are correct. I absolutely recommend this if you're looking for fast casual Mexican"}
{"text":"Eh I'd say this place is average. I haven't had cafe rio anywhere else but I'm hoping since it's new, it'll get better? I've only ordered take out 2 or 3 times by doing my order online. Each time they got something wrong so that was disappointing. Curious to see how this place does in the future"}
{"text":"First time here. A little confused how to order the meal, but I got the chicken burrito , it was very good! Love the fresh made tortilla... I will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite restaurants around. Anything you get here will never disappoint. The staff is always very nice and very quick to make your food. The facility is always clean and it's never too crowded. I love it!  The only downside I have to this place is the long line that is always there. At any given point in the day, you will encounter a line at his place. Fortunately, I'm a pretty faithful customer and I'll come back regardless of the lines"}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Very relaxed, food is delicious, and the price is spot on.  I usually get the salad with grilled chicken, black beans, no rice and salsa verde (you will notice a them with me and Mexican food).  Usually runs me about $10 and it can fill me up for two meals.    Do yourself a favor - if you're taking it to go, call it in or order online.  The line can get a little nutty.  Overall it's a great restaurant, with food that is consistently good at a decent price point.  It's good for lunch or dinner or dinner if you can't finish your lunch.  Gonna go get a salad now... craving one."}
{"text":"I love the food but the guest service at this location is about as bad as it gets. I went today and the girl making the orders looked and acted like she hates being there. She was rude to me and seem extremely irritated with every thing I ordered (a quesadilla and chips and queso). My quesadilla container was so full (at least a 1/4 cup) of broth which she didn't drain before making my food that it ruined my food by the time I got home. The cashier rang me up and as I handed her my payment she asked me if I had the correct change. I asked why and she just asked me again in a hostile voice. I told her no and that she should have change (coin) in her drawer. She rolled her eyes and shook her head. Guess what!! She does not even make the change, it comes out of the machine automatically! I asked for a manger and she told me there was not one in the building at that time. It was at 2:45pm on a Thursday."}
{"text":"I am sorry but I prefer Neveda Cafe Rios the this Lakewood location. First off this Lakewood location doesnt have salmon tacos what a bummer and second I dont know what's up with the staff? They tend to be rude as if though this is their first time working customer service or they just dont care.  They lack management and it reflects on the poor service. I most likely will not come back the food isnt that great to endure rude service. They should really look into who they hire or whom ever is training cause someone isnt doing their job and it reflects..But onthe plus side they offer free child quesadilla for kids under 6. So yah to free stuff.....oh and they should make it a habit to refill their drinks when they are empty, been here three time and I swear the horchata and mint tea where empty...."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this location. I love the food but hate the service!  Well I can't say I totally hate them, there are a few that have done excellent customer service and then there's the few that are young and don't understand the value of customer service.  I hope one day this place surprises me and actually hire people who want to work here or actually like there job, So onto the food, is straight up awesome! Can't go wrong with Salmon tacos or carne asada!  Cafe Rio just has yummy food to choose from period, which makes me turn the other cheek to there not so awesome crew!  My favorite is the house dressing- it's so good I can literally drown any type of food and it's okay. My second favorite part of the food is the homemade tortillas bomb.com!   So if your looking for good food that will fill you up and your tummy head to Cafe Rio!  But if your tired and don't feel like seeing employees who obviously didn't want to come into work or don't feel the need to wear a hair net- then just go to Chipotle"}
{"text":"All Cafe Rio locations I've been to have been really nice, staffed with personable employees, and even when there were long lines never felt like it took TOO long. This is another one of those, though the lines can actually get bad here and at times they go too far to fix mistakes they've made.  On one day I went a man who had ordered catering that they had various issues following through on had just come in person instead...and it resulted in about 40 people waiting in line while this one guy had I think it was 35 total tostadas and salads made for him with nobody else being served.  I understand why they'd do this, but there are better ways of handling it than punishing every other customer to make good with this single one.  Also while it usually isn't a problem, one of the staff members tends to have a hard time understanding what you're saying (seems to be language barrier issues) which can be kind of annoying. Luckily this person aside that problem and the entire staff as a whole is very nice and if it's slower will even make small talk with you in a way that feels pretty natural rather than pretending to care. Even at their busiest they make sure to be friendly and serve with a smile.  Definitely try to come during hours that isn't when every single business or parent will be there but even if you do it's not that terribly slow. Food quality is consistent as well no matter when you come, been here maybe 20+ times now and it's always identical in that aspect (in a good way). Staff again is very good. Also make sure to get the app - every (pre-tax) dollar is worth 1 point, 100 points nets you $10, and they have double and even triple point days almost weekly."}
{"text":"Service just isn't helpful or friendly. Girl at the cashier needs to learn how to smile. My salad wasn't that great and they didn't even toast the tortilla like it looks in the picture... blehg."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  It was close to where we were staying and we stopped by because of Yelp comments.  We were not disappointed! I loved the salmon tacos and had to go back before we left Vegas to have more.  Can't remember what my husband had but he really enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today...I come here a few times per week.... No grilled chicken, out of napkins, out of passion fruit tea, and the drink bar was an absolute mess. Hopefully not under New management.."}
{"text":"This has become one of my go to lunch spots. I love how everything is fresh and made to order right in front of you. The homemade tortillas are delicious. There are many different combinations of items you can get from burritos, enchiladas, salads, tacos, all the usual mexican favorites.   I usually go with a salad or tostada. The house dressing is a creamy tomatillo that is totally addicting. They also have some of the best nachos I've ever had. Completely covered in cheese and then piled with beans, sour cream and guac. Mmmmmm. I also get the salsa fresca which I could just drink!   Don't forget dessert. The coconut flan and tres leches are awesome. They top them with whipped cream and strawberries, are you hungry yet??  They also have a large drink bar with sodas, horchata and the famous mint limeade. The food and service is almost always consistent. Try to avoid the lunch hour (1200-1) but even then they get you through pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Service is relatively quick, and one of the better Cafe Rio locations in the area. However, it feels like every time I go to this location, I have a different experience. Overall, could use some work, but not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Tried the online ordering service and would not recommend. I showed up at the time it was supposed to be ready and it wasn't, which wasn't a big deal. I asked for the drink cups so I could get those while they made the order. They then took 15 minutes and made everyone's order in line and rang them up before making mine. The manager on duty just avoided eye contact. On top of that, they didn't do the order correctly and didn't put all the sides I prepaid for in the bag. The cashier just handed me the bag without saying anything once it was finally  ready. I had to ask the manager if there was anything they could do since the order was 15 minutes late and wrong. He offered a free dessert that wasn't even a part of my order instead of some sort of discount. Just walk in, ordering ahead just means you'll wait while they ring up everyone that came in after you."}
{"text":"I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.  I thought the food was decent.  I thought service was okay.  I am not new to Mexican food, I know what I want:  when I say I want cheese and cilantro and tomatillo salsa,  please give it to me.  They charged me and extra dollar for had smattering of queso fresca.  Boo.  I liked the mango-pineapple aqua, super sweet and clean flavor.  I would go back, maybe."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to eat during the weekend up until a few weeks ago I made an order online and the attendants in the restaurant did not have the order in stating that there is an error that the ordered don't come through online directly to the restaurant. That was fine as I was not in a huge hurry. As I was waiting I was also notified that there was no chicken and that I had to choose another type of meat. Again, not a big deal. What was most frustrating was that they brought the food out and were such in a hurry that they did not go through the order and I did not realize until I was all the way home. When I called to bring it to their attention, the cashiers argued that they made sure to bring it out on time. When I tried to speak with the manager I was kept of hold for more than 10 minutes. I completed a survey and asked that I be contacted and no one called. I guess one customer isn't a big deal to lose."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Very stingy with the meat. My burrito was 90% rice and beans. Wouldn't recommend and won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm standing in line waiting for my food and I immediately regret it. I love Café Rio!!!!!! Unfortunately the one right down the street from my house is an absolute nightmare. Everyone looks miserable except for a couple of friendly faces that's the only reason why I'm giving it 2Stars  instead of one. The owners need to step in and do something about this because it's always a cluster every time I'm here. I hope every time I'm here it will get better. When u have a family of 5 and 3 growing kids you hope for everything to be on point and you're in and out with great service. But not here:("}
{"text":"Food is always great and staff is friendly! Thank you for always having consistent GREAT food quality. Lines are only long because everyone loves this place! Thanks!! Im a HUGE fan!"}
{"text":"It's a fun, quick service taco night before we go to Fat Cats 5$ movie night with the out of school niece and nephews.  6 kids hanging out with uncles and aunts.  It's all fresh and made to order, each get to have it just as they like.  Taco Tuesday makes it very affordable for the families.    It's a popular night and they are line up, but it moves quickly, rice and beans with a drink for $2 is a must have.    The nicest little lady is out front keeping tables clean, very helpful giving us a clean for thirteen.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I think for a quick decent Mexican meal this is a good spot.  Not the kind of place you would go on a date but the food is good and the portions are good.  They make fresh tortillas right there and they're tasty.  I've had the enchiladas and the tacos here and they were good.  I think it is more of a lunch spot than dinner place but it depends on your mood I suppose.  They also have a great selection of hot sauces over by the soda machine so they are almost guaranteed to have what you like in that department.  I think next time I'll try the nachos because I am just a sucker for nachos!"}
{"text":"I made an online order at 530 for a steak salad to be picked up at 645 and the order wasn't even started let alone the fact that there was an additional wait for the steak to be made. I'm not entirely sure what the delay time is between receiving an order to actually making it, but I would think that the desired pickuptime isn't the time to actually start making the order. The wait is the exact reason why I placed an online order to begin with, if I have to wait longer than somebody who just walked in, then what's the point?"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday with a friend since we heard that they are very similar to Chipotle. I was very disappointed.  The food was not as tasty as Chipotle and the service although similar to Chipotle is horrible, I mean terrible.  For a Sunday evening and not very busy the service should be excellent.  Out of the 6 people behind the counter ONLY the lady making the tortillas smiled at us.  And the rest of the staff were all grumpy, not one of them said hello first before what can I get you. Not even a smile.  I got the shredded chicken with black beans, no cheese burrito and then when I got to the girl serving the salsa, I said can I have it on the side, she said sure what else? I said lettuce, she put the salsa down to get the lettuce but never handed it to the cashier.  My friend got the grill chicken taco plate.  We got our order to go and left. My friend said she did not give us the salsa, I said never mind.  I got home and my chicken was dry, the taco plate was not bad.   Advice to Management, if you are going to compete with Chipotle, even if your food is sub par,   your service needs to be excellent.  I prefer to drive the extra 4 miles to get Chipotle. I give you 1 star because of the service over the food."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but that is the only reason I keep coming back. It's definitely not for the customer service.   I went on a Sunday with my mom and sister and they are supposed to open at 11. Another customer walked in through the side door right at 11 as they hadn't opened the front door yet, so we followed. The girl behind the counter told us \"We'll be with you in a couple minutes, we're not open yet.\" Really? Because the sign says 11 and it's 11. I've worked in retail before and if we had customers standing outside the building, we opened early, if not, right on time. You don't keep paying customers waiting, it's just bad business. You should be ready to open right when you are supposed to.   Then I asked if they had any more Cholula because there was none on the shelf and the cashier just immediately answered no without even looking. So I asked for Tapatia. Again, immediate no. So I pointed to the bottle of Tapatia that I saw sitting behind the counter. \"Oh, that must be the last one!\" Oh thanks for going through so much trouble to do your job.  Oh and don't even bother attempting to order an extra taco. I tried ordering an extra shrimp taco once because the order comes with two and I swear it's like I asked then to perform the unspeakable. I told then I would pay the price for the single taco (You can order two or just one so obviously combine the price. I know it's expensive. I just want three tacos!) And the kid taking my order still had to consult with two other people before they would make me three.   I love the steak and shrimp tacos and I crave the creamy cilantro dressing. If the customer service was better, I would have given a better rating."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing amazing. The one thing this place has going for it, is the house made tortillas. They are pretty bomb!  At this particular Cafe Rio, my experience was just meh. Half of the staff I dealt with were happy and seemed to be in a good mood, while the other half seemed miserable as hell. They also seem to skimp on the sides.  I'd be willing to come back and give this location another try"}
{"text":"Love this place and their food!  It does get stressful; however, when you're ordering because it seems they are pushing you along very quickly, but it's all worth it.  Large portions, and have loved everything I've tried, although the pork is a little too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio location is by work and home for me and I eat here often. The service is always fast and the food always good. My favorite meal is the barbacoa (don't order this if you don't like sweet meat) tostada with the house dressing. I've ordered pretty much everything and have had every kind of meat they offer and all of them are so good! There's nothing that I wouldn't eat, if ordered. TIP: If you don't eat the tortilla from the salad, you can totally order the tostada and save a couple bucks!  On the contrary, the desserts are not very good. I've tried all of them and I wouldn't order any of them again, nor did I finish them when I actually did.   Another down side is that the Cafe Rio drinks aren't very good towards the end of the day. I do understand that they don't make a new batch when they are close to closing, but I can't get my favorite drink (horchata) if it's after 7pm because it just tastes terrible."}
{"text":"Man I love this place. Nachos!  Tacos! And for the love of all things cheesy, queso too.  Fresh tortillas are delicious. The drink selection is top notch. I love mixing their sugar free lemonade with the mint limeade. Mmmmmm. Service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"The dirtiest restaurant in all of Gilbert.  How this place stays open, is just a mystery.  That being said, the food was bland and mediocre, at best.  Save yourself $5 per person and get better food at Chipotle or Qdoba."}
{"text":"You would think that being new, the people would be excited to work there.   But, that's not the case.   The crew all look like prisoners and they move SO SLOW!  The sense of urgency here is not only lacking, it's non existent.  That being said, I love Cafe Rio and will be back.  I just wish they would fix this one.   The older, heavyset manager is condescending and rude.  I asked for a salad and he asked if I wanted cilantro on it and before I could answer, he dumped a handful on top.  I said \"I don't want and cilantro and he started to pick it off, instead of remaking the salad.  Then he sarcastically said \"the pico de Gallo has cilantro, so it's still on there\".  I know that, but it's not huge sprigs of it.  He sets the example and that's why this place is messed up.  He's tense, rude and sarcastic, just like his crew.   The manager sets the tone and his is horrible."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 items online. They got 2 of them wrong. I called management and was assured that if I brought the receipt in the next day, I would receive a refund. I went the next day and was told by a different manager that it would have to go through Corporate (???) Not going to hold my breath but will call tomorrow and chew some major butt at Corp.  TOTAL RIPOFF !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, and this has become one of our favorite go-to spots when we want a simple and quick meal. It never gets old."}
{"text":"First off, I was excited to see a location opening up near my home. I have heard from friends how good this place is. I went yesterday for my first time and brought our food home. The food was good as expected. The part that bugged me and why I can't give them 5 stars is the attitude of the staff from beginning to end. They were acting annoyed with the slowness of my ordering. It's a place I've never been so of course it's gonna be foreign to me. I understand it's new to the staff too but they were not busy. 1 person in front of me and 1 person behind me. At the end they wouldn't take my buy 1 get one free coupon because I didn't order two of the exact same thing. The coupon is misleading and doesn't clearly state it has to be two of the same item. The girl was rude when she told me I couldn't use the coupon. It was like she was happy to say no to a customer. As someone in the food and beverage industry I advise the management of this location to work with your staff on how to treat new customers."}
{"text":"Great service, had the tamales, very good. I'm happy to have new fresh options in the area!"}
{"text":"This location is just sad. We ordered to pick up: chicken tacos with sour cream and the salsa and chips. We brought it home to find the food was COLD. Not just warm but cold. The chicken was very dry and hard to get down without a lot of water. No sour cream on the five tacos, though we were charged for it. The salsa was weird, like it wasn't blended up all the way... Just huge, long strips of the veggies. Not appealing. We keep trying to give benefit of the doubt, hoping for a better result but it's been crappy for many months now. Will not go here anymore."}
{"text":"Don't let the one star fool you.  Food is great but I've been to a few Cafe Rio's and they all have great food. They all are consistently good.   This Cafe Rio in particular is horrible.  They have horrible service.  Every time I go I consistently order $50 - $60 of food.  They have screwed up my order EVERYTIME."}
{"text":"I really like Cafe Rio. If you look at my previous reviews, I've been looking for a fantastic Mexican place in Vegas. Care Rio does fill a void in my heart, but this is not authentic Mexican food. It's this kind of Mexican but kind of something else. Nevertheless, it's really yummy. I highly recommend the Barbacoa burrito. Did you not hear me? I highly recommend the Barbacoa burrito. Don't order anything else. I'm sure their other food is good, but order the Barbacoa. It's f*ing fantastic. I order it whenever I'm on that side of town. You need to try it. Say it with me now: I'll have the Barbacoa burrito please!"}
{"text":"My wife got me turned into Cafe Rio and we have visited several locations including Scottsdale, Phoenix Biltmore area, Mesa and Avondale. I have been to the Norterra (Happy Valley) location three times and while the food had been good (the two times we've ate there -- once we did not, details below) have been disappointed in the service.  Their steak tacos are to die for and are so filling I don't need the rice or beans so I get the tacos a-la-carte.  Their pico de gallo is pretty good, and that's coming from someone who usually doesn't eat tomatoes.  Their hot salsa had a heck of a kick as well.  The problem with this location is that it isn't well run.  The first visit was okay but the second was awful. The line was very long and we waited for 45 minutes only to be told they were completely out of steak and it was only 8:00 pm.  They could have said something because I am certain I wasn't the only person in line that was looking for it.  We were so frustrated that we left and went to SmashBurger instead which was across the street.  We went again last night hoping hat the previous visit was an anomaly.  Again there was a bit of a line but it moved fairly quickly this time, which was surprising because their staff was extremely disorganized and were mixing up orders.  The family in front of us had ordered quesadillas for their children but didn't get them and then when they went to pay their card was declined and the cashier was at a loss to what to do. She let us skip ahead of them and paid for our order but we had asked for chips and salsa and only got salsa so we weren't charged for chips but didn't realize that until we reminded them we didn't get out chips so we had to pay for them separately.  Im giving two stars since a 1-star review would be a terrible experience but at least the food was good this time."}
{"text":"It is very sad when a good place puts a bad manager in charge. The service was horrible and the employees are clueless. Guess I will find a new place to eat at."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple other Cafe Rios in Chandler and really enjoy going. Went to the new one in Gilbert tonight, and if I'd never been to a Cafe Rio before , I would never go back. Atmosphere was very disappointing. Ugly tables set up to seat large groups, very little separate seating. Actually, very little seating. Tables were dirty. Lots of workers and no one cleaning. I definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Consistently pretty good. Both chicken and steak. Would like to see them offer a red salsa for their chips n salsa rather than only a green one."}
{"text":"Wow what a horrible experience here, and it's not the first time. Only one person working here acted like they wanted their job. I bought my mom a enchilada and the lady literally threw everything on top of the tortilla. She then broke the tortilla in half. By the time it came out it was a blob of sauce, tortilla bits, and chicken. Go to the one in centennial, so much better."}
{"text":"First time visit and ordered take out. I arrive at pick up time and the order was ready. Place was very busy. Got three dishes for the family, cheese enchiladas,  chicken quesildilla and pork burrito. Dishes come in aluminum dishes with fitted tops so everything was kept warm. All items were quite good for a fast/ casual resturant. Good size portions and for the amount of food the prices are fine. You can build your dish with various add ons. The resturant has dine in also.   Nice addition to the culinary desert that is northwest Peoria, near Vistancia."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Café Rio, but given it's convenient location and online ordering, we decided to pick some up for a quick dinner last week.   We placed our order and left to pick it up in the time scheduled. We arrived at the restaurant and the food wasn't ready yet. We weren't in a huge hurry, but they seem a little disorganized at this location. It took several people to handle our checkout and when they said my mom's bowl wasn't ready because the chicken was still cooking and would take another 15 minutes, they offered us a different protein. Since we didn't want the rest of the food to be sitting out while we waited for the grilled chicken she changed to shredded chicken. It was only after we decided that did we realize they hadn't even made the rest of the food yet, so there was really no need to change the order.   The food was ok, but I don't see myself going out of my way to return to this location with better non-chain restaurants in the area I'd rather give my money to."}
{"text":"No matter how often I try Cafe Rio, I still can't find anything on the menu that I like. The meats are always either bland or overly seasoned, the sauces they use are always too sweet or salty, or both.  The only redeeming quality I've found is that their veggies are typically fresh. This location was no different and despite putting in our order online, a lot of our order was mixed up and some of us were missing condiments and they didn't pack any utensils or napkins in our to go box."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Rio on a few previous occasions, so I came in not thinking very highly of their food. I came in for lunch recently and was surprised that I actually liked it a lot more than I remembered.   I ordered the sweet barbacoa salad and although it was nothing amazing, the flavors were pretty good. They make their own tortillas, but honestly I was not a big fan of them. The texture was just off, so I'll probably stay away from their burritos. They have quite a few different menu options, which is nice as well. My salad was flavorful and the portions are enormous, which makes it a great option for lunch. There do seem to be a lot of flavors going on at one time, so flavor is definitely the name of the game at Cafe Rio.   The restaurant itself is extremely loud at lunchtime and the line was incredibly long. It's all right grub, but I still prefer Chipotle to Cafe Rio as far as chain build your own burrito restaurants."}
{"text":"This location has a poor staff.  I now understand why people dine in.  It takes so long to get thru the ordering process and checking out that the food is cold by the time you get it.  The gal putting the extras on orders was a sloppy, inefficient, wasteful mess.  Spilling everything she grabbed into every other item bin.  Not to mention having a terrible attitude.  I understand these employees are all probably paid minimum wage and are 17 or under in age but when I pay $13.00 for a Burrito that isn't even better than Chipotle with the poor service I received, it can't justify going back.  The entire ordering and timing process needs to be examined and experience dramatic changes.  There was only 6 people in line in front of me and it took me 24mins from getting my order taken to checking out."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and it's rare to have an experience (food wise) that disappoints. They know how to make good food, I can tell you that much! Regardless which Cafe Rio location you go to you can expect the food to taste the same, and not worry about anything tasting odd or off. When we went I ordered my usual of a smothered sweet Barbacoa burrito. It was delicious. It oozes with delicious flavor each bite!  My only qualm about this location is that I found a lot of the workers particularly unfriendly. The man at the front who was making the tortillas was so nice and helpful, but moving along the line, if someone even looked at me it was rare. No one smiled, they rushed you (it wasn't even busy), and they looked miserable.  It's close to my boyfriends family's house so I am sure I will go again when visiting simply because of convenience."}
{"text":"Good for what it is.  Consistent and fast service.  Not traditional mexican almost a sweet taste to most items but works in a way."}
{"text":"I am used to expecting less than perfect service at non-Eastern Ave Cafe Rio locations while still being a loyal and loving customer eager to get their Rio on. I've been to this location once before and remembered not enjoying it but it was only one experience months ago and it's still Cafe Rio so I decided to come back a second time.  I ordered a salad minus beans which was fine, and my boyfriend ordered a bean rice and cheese burrito after me. As I said, I am used to less than perfect service at other Rio locations, like receiving less burrito fillings or less hot sauce and cheese than usual. However, when I ask for a bean, rice, and cheese burrito and you give me a rice and cheese burrito with (I can't make this up) literally 12 beans in it, you have gone beyond bad service and into the territory of downright insulting. If you ran out of pinto beans you could have asked me to wait while you get more instead of serving me 12 beans and throwing a deflated rice and cheese burrito into the belt oven like we're a couple of idiots who won't notice or care. I had to tell the next guy in the prep line (who was very nice) that we did not want the burrito because it had no beans in it and then compromised to have him add beans on the side because I didn't want my boyfriend starving out of pure spite. That prep person arranged for it to be free with the cashier without my noticing. And then I get to the register and the cashier is completely short with me when I begin asking for it discounted not realizing he just told her it was free. I wasn't expecting her to comfort me over my crappy burrito but I certainly wasn't expecting to be treated like I was the person inconveniencing her.  My conclusion, I came in here planning to buy TWO food items properly prepared according to what's written ON THE MENU. I did not come in here planning to buy ONE item and receive another one FREE and SCREWED UP. Don't give me stuff that's FREE AND SCREWED UP. Have some standards and don't ever hand out stuff that screwed up free or not. On top of that, don't treat me like I AM the one creating a problem for you, when YOU screwed up.   If I am ever in the area again I will go to Chipotle instead. Even though I never, never, eat at Chipotle and I feel uncomfortable with the idea of eating there, at least I can hope to not be served by people in such a ridiculous manner."}
{"text":"This place has better service by far than any other Rio location. The workers are motivated, attentive, and most importantly professional  The number one thing about this place, freshness. Most notably, the soft and fresh tortillas made minutes before you eat. They also have fresh homemade horchata and other tasty and unique drink options with free refills. In addition to being delicious, this place is vegetarian (even vegan) friendly.   As some have mentioned, eating here DOES get expensive. A simple burrito will seem to be around $6 at first but after enchilada style, side guacamole and sour cream, and a medium drink, you will find yourself more than doubling your original estimate. That side of guac by the way, is very modest. They do have daily specials though which include a drink in the price. And they also offer a stamp card towards a free meal. However, once you reach ten stamps you have most likely spent around $100 here.   This is also one of the few foods out there that still tastes great when you order out."}
{"text":"The long line moved slow and when I noticed that the employees had no sense of urgency, moving at a snail's pace I understood why.  I got a salad which was okay, my husband the burrito and my son a tiny kids meal which still left him hungry. The drink station was cool but pricey.  The employees were not friendly, never said thank you or smiled.  They acted like they were doing US a favor.    Next time we will just stick with Chipotle."}
{"text":"This place seems like it's ALWAYS busy around lunch time and usually there isn't anywhere to sit unless you happen to catch people leaving and just grab their table and it isn't too dirty because I've never seen anyone come around and wipe tables down between customers.  The 4 stars come from food alone.  The homemade tortillas are amazeballs (and I don't even like tortillas, I'm a rice kinda girl).  The salad (basically an unwrapped burrito) is soooo good and huge.  I can barely finish 1/2 a salad.  I usually get a grilled chicken salad with everything on it.  I'd recommend getting the tortilla on the side though, because it'll get soggy at the bottom of your salad.  The green house ranch dressing thing they have is delicious as well.  I also like the drink and tea selection and I like that they encourage you to mix their drinks into different combinations.  Service at this location is just okay, nothing outstanding.  Also, if you have a sensitive stomach and GI tract, i would be cautious.  Some people end up getting Cafe Rio stomach (which is fairly comparable to Chipotle stomach) if you know what I mean.  If you don't, then don't worry about it!"}
{"text":"Great service and tasty salsa. I had the steak tostada and the spicy salsa. Hot fresh and delicious. Will come again."}
{"text":"We normally have no issues at Cafe Rio but we had never been to this location. The place was not crowded but the line just stopped while various assembly line workers just waited aimlessly instead of shifting orders that they could fill ahead and keep things moving. Also cooking staff was supposed to keep the trivets filled but that wasn't happening either. Forget this location if they are at all busy. Then I attempted to convert my Cafe Rio card to their new app point's system with instructions to scan the barcode at the bottom of my slip into my app but turns out there was no barcode! Next day I returned and the manager said no barcode meant points were posted but they weren't. I contacted online Help and 3 days later my points we're posted. My salad came with guacamole but instead of a healthy scoop she plopped on a thimble of guac  (see pic). Place needs employee training."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio. today was super slow, bad attitude day it seems. all the employees were super pushy and very irritated with basic requests such as guac or sour cream. granted the food ended up being delicious, as always, customer service for sure needs improvement at this location."}
{"text":"The food is good but for the tenth time they've forgotten to put my salad dressing in the to go container. Ridiculous that something so simple they can't get it right. I'm going to go to the Durango location ... much better service and faster than the one on Sahara."}
{"text":"Yikes,  Saturday night (decatur location, 7 pm. ). crazy long lines.  The food processors doing ok, checkout to pay impossible.  Everyone needs something, a cover for salad, more salsa/tomatoes/change in register/simply the ability to pick up order and pay.  Orders are everywhere.  Then go for your drink,  tea is empty, horchata empty,  huge pile of ice on machines making it impossible to use half soda fountain.    The girl monitoring the floor says 5 minutes to refill, 30 minutes later no drinks!  She pays no attention to pile of ice.  No attention to empty drinks.  30 minutes is focused on making napkins neat in their shelf piles.   WHERE Is MGMT?   Nowhere to be found.  Weekend visit never again."}
{"text":"If they allowed me to sub-group reviews of different fare, I'd give anything pork barbacoa about five stars, anything but the fish tacos at least four stars, and the fish tacos although trumpeted as a special of the day really wasn't all that special.  But let's get back to the Pork Barbecoa which sounds like a comic book Swine Pirate but is really a tasty and filling way to spend your lunch or dinner. We come here often and I've tried the other items but the PB is what I return for.  Plus my neices love how they display their happiness when you order extra meat."}
{"text":"One of the worst places food was so gross and my burrito was so disgusting I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Holy Gross. Service is awful and the place is filthy.  The cashier was picking her eyes into our salads.  Garossss"}
{"text":"I don't understand how they are out of queso every single time I come here. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight since it's so close to the gym. I love the food but every time I check to see if they have horchata it's always empty. The staff members aren't too friendly and some look miserable to even be there. My husband got the tamales special because he wanted to try it. Unfortunately, he got the last ones and they weren't the best. I got the usual food I get. Pork barbacoa tostado. Something in particular I didn't like was I had told the lady helping me that I didn't want cheese and then she put cheese onto my food. I'm lactose so I can only eat so much dairy. I didn't have a fun time picking out the cheese under all of the lettuce and cilantro they gave."}
