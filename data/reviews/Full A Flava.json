{"text":"Delicious Caribbean food!  The jerk chicken is an amazing blast of flavor and very tender!  They have daily specials- make sure to head on over on Monday for some delish oxtail!!  My favorite dish on the menu is the vegetables!  I can't quite identify all the delectable herbs that they use to season the cabbage, but it is amazing!  The service is excellent as well!  If you're a fan of Caribbean cuisine, this new restaurant will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The food is so good!  They are just opening up so still getting the appropriate tables and chairs.  Right now the have mostly high tops.  But the food is so good.  The owners/managers seem to be authentic and care about getting right.  I will definitely go back because Glendale need more FLAVOR   :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I had a coupon. Would NOT return. I could write a small book on the things that were wrong with the place. I'll just touch on the highlights... 1. Half of the extremely limited menu was unavailable 2. I ordered jerk chicken and got more bones than chicken. 3. I asked for a couple glasses of water for my wife and I and we were brought a bottle of water. Good thing it was my wife and she doesn't mind sharing! 4. General service was not friendly. 5. Got \"instant rice\", you know the stuff that cooks up in five minutes. They claim to be authentic Jamaican food. There is no way food out of a box passes for authentic in my book. 6. Restaurant was in need of cleaning and employees chatting and surfing the net on a laptop at front counter.  Could go on, but my point is made..."}
