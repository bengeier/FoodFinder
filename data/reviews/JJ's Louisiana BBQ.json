{"text":"Great food and great service. Turkey leg was off the chain...also try the fish fry dinners on Friday; I would have to say this is the best BBQ in town u can't go wrong going to jjs Louisiana Bbq, get u some!"}
{"text":"My workplace is about halfway between JJs and Westgate. Previously we would head to Shane's for BBQ, but now that JJs has opened, this will be my go-to for lunch!  We sampled the 3-meat plate and tried the link sausage, brisket and ribs. The meat is moist and rib meat falls off the bone. It is served without BBQ sauce (as BBQ should be) but they offer a mild and spicy version of their sauce, both of which are fantastic.  We spent about 20 minutes there eating, had a nice conversation with the owners and left stuffed and happy. Paid much less than we would at the chain places in the area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and immediately the smell of smoked meat engulfs you. Great variety and super friendly staff. Meat perfectly cooked and seasoned with care. Reasonable price and liked the endless coolaid. Nice atmosphere and everyone makes you feel at home. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Really loved the chicken and pulled pork. Great BBQ sauce as well. Slightly sweet and tangy. The beans taste a little like chili (which I like), and the potato salad is delicious."}
{"text":"If you want the best bbq you have ever had, go visit James at JJ Louisiana BBQ. Brisket was tasty and tender, chicken was most and juicy. Ribs just fell off the bone."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and I will definitely be back! Had the brisket, rib tips, baked beans and Mac and cheese. I've had a lot of BBQ throughout the country and here in Arizona I've usually been disappointed with other establishments brisket. Little Miss BBQ was the only place with amazing brisket in Arizona until today. The brisket was flavorful and tender, no need to put sauce on it.    The rib tips were great as well, the top layer was a little dry but underneath was moist, juicy, flavorful rib meat. Next time I will try the ribs and not just the tips.   The baked beans aren't your typical overly sweet beans. They're packed with flavor and meat, a must try. The mac and cheese was a little dry, could use a little more cheese sauce but I love a very creamy Mac and cheese. And last but not least, try and save room for the peach cobbler, so so good.    If the food isn't enough to keep you coming back, the staff will. It's family owned and ran and they make you feel like you're part of their family.   I really hope this place succeeds and thrives because this is exactly the type of place that Glendale needs."}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever. Love it all. I follow him around the city to get his food. I have tried the pulled pork and the brisket and they both blew me away. My 4yr old daughter is picky about what she eats, but she immediately fell in love with the brisket and wants it every time we see him. The food is so good i always finish it in the car before i get home."}
{"text":"We tried them at the Chandler Bbq Festival. We had a combination of chicken, tips and brisket and everything was dome of the best we've had in Arizona. All was cooked perfectly. The bbq sauce is spicy, l liked it but was much for my wife. A knife would've help when we were sharing the meat but i'm looking forward to eating here again soon."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we highly recommend it. It was some of the best BBQ meat we have had from a restaurant! Loved the chicken, brisket, and rib tips. Really nice owners who work really hard to  satisfy their customers. They are very accommodating and gave us samples to help us decide what to get. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq I've had in AZ! The staff members are so friendly and I'd highly recommend the chopped beef sandwich and the corn. Everything is seasoned well and nice and tender. Definitely a new staple restaurant in my book :)"}
{"text":"If you're in downtown Glendale, try out this new BBQ place. Very friendly people simply serving delicious food for a good price in a casual setting. The brisket is amazing! Wash it down with some sweet tea."}
{"text":"Found this gem of  a place hidden on the south side of Glendale ave and 56 ave.  It ain't fancy but JJ serves up the best BBQ I've had anywhere... and I've eaten BBQ all over this country and also smoke my own briskets, pulled pork, ribs, salmon, turkey.... in my ceramic backyard smoker and I have to tell you I was impressed with JJs tender morsels of well seasoned and smoked to melt in your mouth tenderness.  Our party of 4 really enjoyed our meals and JJs warm and caring conversation and service.  It's a ride from where I live in N Scottsdale and the ride is worth it..  It is by far the best BBQ in town and amongst the best I've eaten anywhere..   Lloyd"}
{"text":"Omg! This is one of my favorite bbq places ive had in a awhile the staff if very personable and friendly very much like home! All of the food is all homemade the peach cobbler is out if this world brisket is bomb Mac and cheese rib tips green beans are all yummy you will not go away hungry! Love them like family! J.R."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ joint hidden in the heart of downtown Glendale. Tried the pulled pork and brisket. Both were very moist and flavorful with a touch of smoky pecan wood. It did not even need sauce, but tried both the mild and hot-both were fantastic! Baked beans have chunks of meat and a yummy spicy kick. Green beans like mom used to make cooked with smoky bacon! Were surprised to learn they have cornmeal battered fried catfish (my fave!) on Fridays! Don't forget the perfect (obviously made from scratch) peach cobbler! It all paired well with the yummy kool-aid and sweet tea! Also enjoyed the friendly staff! Very welcoming and even let me sample the catfish! We will definitely be back! Glad you have a permanent home here in Glendale, JJ's!"}
{"text":"\"As I always say, before you put any sauce on you have to try it first.\" - JJ Southern barbecue can't be touched. You can tell this man has a lot of pride in what he does. That brisket was amazing by the way! If you see this guy around the city make sure to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"After reading the numerous great reviews for this little hole in the wall, we decided to venture off the beaten path to indulge ourselves into some delicious food. The descriptions of the menu themselves from other people made my mouth drool as I pictured incredible tastes and an amazing time strapping on the ole feedbag. Needless to say my faith in Yelp user reviews and high ranked restaurants went out the door faster than I wanted to be after tasting this BBQ disaster.   We both decided on two meat dinner meals, then came with an choice of 2 meats, roll, and two sides. The price listed was $15 a piece for this dinner, so I was expecting a heaping of home style goodness. The moment I saw a Styrofoam plate with dividers in it for my food I was worried but hoped for a good serving still. Getting brisket, rib tips, corn and baked beans, I was ready to roll. The Mrs. got pulled pork and brisket also, along with mac and cheese and corn. Add a couple drinks and a banana pudding that lots of folks seemed to love we were ready to eat.  Meats- Brisket was dry as could be, with no help from the lack luster sauces that could be found on the table. Not to mention it was barely warmed, which some of the food seemed to suffer from. My \"rib tips\" were 3 little pieces of meat that set next to each other were roughly half the size of my palm. Also not warmed and dry as a bone. Pulled pork was the only winner in the group, and I use the term winner loosely because it was only thing anyone could manage to eat without making too many faces.  Side- Corn was a half cob of frozen corn. You could tell the taste. Some spices on it to try to help but mushy texture when you bit into it. I feel sorry if you buy it as a side for $3. Baked beans were not traditional style baked beans, more like a chili taste according to others. Not worth it at all. Mac and cheese was dry as well, with little taste or cheese and a sense of almost being reheated from a prior day batch.  Drinks- Place has cans of soda for a $1 or unlimited refills for sweet tea, regular tea, or Hawaiian Punch. Punch was enjoyed, but sweet tea(huge tea  drinker personally) has to rank as one of the worst tasting sweet teas I have ever had.  Desert- Banana pudding was more vanilla wafer than pudding. Left your mouth dry and having to drink something to finish it.   Total cost:$40 I never do reviews. I have an okay experience or even underwhelming one I tend to chalk it up to a life experience to make better choices next time. The fact this place has so many good reviews and the overall quality of the food along with price that I experienced is what forced me to inform people about my ordeal. if you read closer there are a few reviews like mine questioning the good reviews. The guys working were super nice and the atmosphere was fine at the time, and we really were hoping to find our next hole in the wall treasure. This is fools gold disguised as treasure, so just keep it buried."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is delicious. The best bbq in town!  The chopped brisket was phenomenal. Beautiful smoke ring, moist and tender. Hey had two bbq sauces to chose from Mild and Spicy. Both were delish. Also had some peach cobble, I thought I died and had gone to cobbler heaven.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Having tried several BBQ joints around the valley, and around the country, I have to honestly say this is the very best I have had to date.   I'm not saying there isn't better out there; I am saying this is the best pulled pork and brisket that I have had.  You know how brisket has a tendency to dry out when smoked?  If you have ever tried this at home you do know what I mean.   Well JJ's doesn't seem to know that.  Their brisket is still moist when served and delicious to boot.  I just got back from eating my usual pulled pork sandwich, and it never disappoints.   The meat is so tender and tasty it doesn't need sauce.  The first half I ate without and then for dessert I added the sauce on the last half.  :-)   Speaking of dessert, JJ's wife makes homemade peach cobbler.  Bottom line is a am really REALLY grateful for this place.  I am having visitors from Germany come in next week for business reasons.  Let's hope they like catered BBQ cuz that's what they are gonna get!"}
{"text":"I am one picky eater. My husband wanted BBQ and we've been to tons of them and I was hardly impressed with the ones we've tried. I trusted Yelp on this one. The front isn't nice but the food is delicious. We walk in and right away we were greeted. Meat was cooked perfect and the sauce added great flavor. I had the BBQ ribs and my husband had the brisket combos. FREAKING DELICIOUS. Meat came off the bone just by looking at it :) You can tell the owner (James and his wife) cook their food with love.  You won't be disappointed. We'll definitely be back!!! God bless."}
{"text":"I drove by one day and decided to stop. I'm so happy I did! It is really really good. The bbq pulled pork was the best I've ever had. I can't wait to try everything else he offers."}
{"text":"First off I must say wow I was so surprised at how good this place is this is definitely when the holes in the wall off the beaten path 57th Avenue just south of Glendale in a ran down building but don't let that deter you from coming here this would have to be the best brisket I've ever had in Arizona moist just enough fat Pull-A-Part tender and just the right amount of smoke beautiful smoke ring and super flavorful there barbecue sauce have a mild and a spicy I prefer the spicy not the greatest sauce but seriously you don't need it with this brisket now for the banana pudding was great lots of cinnamon full cookies wonderful now the mac and cheese not so good very dry not much cheese more Mack than anything definitely a mac and cheese that you must skip will be back very soon love barbecue must place to stop"}
{"text":"OK, now I have seen this trailer & smoker (JJ's Louisiana BBQ) with a simple stand set up at the Walmart the last few weekends and each time, I have passed it by. OMG!!! Tonight, I took a leap of faith and got the rib meal. Hands down the best smoked ribs I've ever tasted in my life! They were moist and the smoke ring was generous on these babies. The dinner was $10.00 cash and came with a soft potato roll & two sides (beans & potato salad) the beans were smokey and had meat in them too.  I can't believe this place wasn't on YELP yet.  From their website, it looks like they move around to diferent locations.  I found them at the 79th Ave & Peoria Walmart up on the entryway sidewalk. The menu displayed showed pulled pork, chicken or rib dinners. I can't wait to find them next week to try out the smoked chicken. YUM! If you love good BBQ, they would definitely be worth a try. Don't forget to give them a call to see where they will be for the day."}
{"text":"These might be the best baby back ribs I've ever had. They were so well cooked even the bone was falling apart. So incredibly tender it was unbelievable. Their homemade BBQ sauces were insanely good too. Man, he's got to move up here from tuscon."}
{"text":"Service with a smile excellent brisket and had a turkey leg to go! Definitely a gem in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ, the smoked meats are some of the best you will get any where in the Phoenix area! The meat portions are good size, the side portions could be a little bigger! The service was outstanding with a very knowledgeable staff and all are very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ sandwich and sauce I ever bought. The guys were very nice to talk too. They cater events. I can't wait to eat there again.  Great , Great , Great"}
{"text":"Now that JJ's has moved off of street-selling into a bricks & mortar side-street entrance to the back-of-the-corner-market's storage room, to many people's disappointment, JJ's has taken a full-on nose-dive tailspin that I hope he can pull out of before he crashes.  Sent in a reconnaissance team & learned that JJ's has not transformed it's branding into a warm-welcoming homey & cozy environment with accoutrements and ambiance of a good- eating BBQ restaurant that patrons expect.  It is cold, stark, and pretty much not a place where most people would feel comfortable eating. Eating in a mess hall tent has a much better ambiance.   Portions were very stingy, dry, & unseasoned catfish was tasteless.  Not even having a self-serve soda machine with ice & free refills puts JJ's at the bottom of the list, plus serving on styrofoam shows how miserly the owners are.  Beans seemed right out if the can, as well as the biscuits from a plastic bag package.  Corn was merely a boiled frozen \"cobbett\" with not much flavor nor sweetness.  Good cobs are often roasted & even coated.  The unseasoned plain mac'n cheese was also obviously a previously frozen product.  Cole slaw came from a restaurant food supplier like Costco. I am very sad for how JJ's food has dropped in quality because James is a really nice guy.  But, nice guys don't satisfy one's taste buds and fill the stomach to feel like one has paid the right price for a great tasting fulfilling meal.  Didn't try the dessert.  Team said what they saw wasn't appetizing & seemed over-priced.  Banana pudding?  Ugh!  Blah!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. . . !   Prepared with love and soul, by a friendly down-to-earth Southern Gentleman.  His right-hand man is equally pleasant and accommodating to your needs.."}
{"text":"After months of searching, I found him again.  JJ's now has a permanent location.  5601 W Glendale Avenue.  It's right downtown within walking distance of City Hall, and a big parking lot a few steps from the front door.  They're gonna need it.  This permanent place offers the same great food that I love, but now has a spotlessly clean seating area.  I'll still be taking food home, but rest assured I'll be hanging out feeding my face in this BBQ Joint of my youth.  Reminds me of those little tucked away places you find around New Orleans, Memphis, and throughout Texas.  Btw Texas doesn't have anything on James' Brisket.  Slow smoked, juicy and melts in your mouth.    Lets also talk Turkey Legs.  I've only had them at the State Fair and thought they were good, but JJ's are a whole different ball game.  I learned, unlike those elsewhere that are prepared in a factory and reheated, JJ's are naturally seasoned and slow smoked in that big cooker.  Just like everything else there, with no additives or preservatives.    One last thing, this Joint, doesn't sell beer or wine, BUT there is a HALLWAY between him and a convenience store that does SELL ICE COLD BEER to wash down the FABULOUS BBQ.  Life just doesn't get much better.  CK"}
{"text":"Don't believe all the hype this place is terrible I don't know why people like it I'm a stop depending on yelp  because they're not true reviews. We asked for rib tip dinner and what we got was some dry look at the website look like they were from last week. And they weren't even rip tips he didn't tell us until after we had paid. This place is disgusting don't go here don't listen to all the reviews that says good because it's not"}
{"text":"So far so good.  Went to this restaurant to grab a lunch to take back to my office.  I was immediately distracted by the turkey leg sign.  I'd been craving one all summer and thought there were none in the valley until I went to JJs.  It was amazing and I will definitely be back to try the other choices."}
{"text":"I've eaten at about 10 different barbecue places in the valley and this place is BY FAR the best.   The best ribs I've ever had anywhere - I couldn't even bring myself to put barbecue sauce on them.   The brisket is real smoky and just damn delicious.  Do yourself a favor and eat here.   Amazing."}
{"text":"Searched for this place and even called the business, hoping to experience this great food! You will not find this on a Friday night or even Saturday night, it was such a disappointment when we called for the location after searching for it, told on Friday night that he was closed and to come on Saturday night for a live band. There is no sign for this business and no evidence it exists! Totally disappointed that we wasted our time two nights in a row to find a unknown location."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance on the way to a football game and I have debated on driving from Tempe just to have it again and it hasn't even been two weeks. Authentic and made with love. Walking in my mouth instantly watered. The pulled pork was RIDICULOUS. And the sauces are bomb! Not too spicy either, try them both! Mac n cheese mm mm mmm. Prices are super fair too! Support small and local you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First timers. The staff is great, very nice and helpful. Portions were perfect. The food smelled amazing and we were not disappointed. Would suggest this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I was first turned onto jjs when he had his truck and smoker trailer at the Walmart at 79 and Peoria about 4 years ago now. He eventually got the boot from there Due to lack of permits   After a 6 month hiatus, he started setting up shop at 95 and Peoria in a parking lot. He finally got permitted up and started getting some business. Once he stared getting some reputation, he started doing the west side food truck scene and the farmers fair at 98/Northern.   After a few years of dominating the Bbq genre, he locked in this sit-down location in old town Glendale.    First of all, the food out on the streets he used to crank out tasted so much better. The food now tastes and looks like it sits in food warmers all day. Having following him all these years, I feel the food quality has diminished. It's too bad because JJ means well and has a good heart.    Food is about 10 a plate and drinks are from a can or cooler. Food is served on paper plates and like warm.   There is far better Bbq out there, but if your in a pinch, in old town Glendale, and have a craving for Bbq...give JJ a try."}
{"text":"This is a must place to visit if you like old school bbq. There aint no fillers here the brisket melts in your mouth and you get sad when it's all gone! The owners are great so don't be late! Opens @ 11:00 !!"}
{"text":"Thank you JJ from Shreveport! Your amazing brisket and fixin's really hit the spot for this homesick Texas girl!!! P.S. I found this little gem of a food truck on 95th Ave and Peoria.. all you serious BBQ lovers need to take a drive and check this place out"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the valley by a long shot Try it you will love it. They have my business, I'm from Texas and this was as good as Texas bbq.  Thanks"}
{"text":"First, the place is NOT located ON Glendale Avenue, but around the corner on 56th. Once we figured that out and found the entrance, we were impressed by the cordial greeting of the owners, and the clean but unpretentious atmosphere. I was happily surprised to pay for our order; the tab was roughly half what we usually pay for a similar quantity of BBQ grub at places like Dave's or Shanes.   So: how good is the food? Mine was just great. I ordered a two-meat plate featuring brisket and pulled pork. My wife had the one-meat plate, featuring ribs. We both found all of the pecan-smoked meat to be exceptionally tasty. The sides of beans and corn on the cob were also excellent. The slaw was good, nothing special, as were the rolls.   The only reservation came from my wife who thought the \"mild\" BBQ sauce was flavorful but a bit too spicy for her.  But she can't take ANY hint of heat to her food. We both agreed that this is a place we'll return to quite often. We also felt a lot of respect for the owners, who obviously care about providing quality food at a great value, and in a welcoming, hospitable setting."}
{"text":"JJ's was one of the caterers for the Great South West Cajun Fest.  I tried the brisket at each of the venues and JJ's was by far the best.  Tasty.  Smoky. Spicy.  Friendly service. So why three stars?  Simple.  One slice of brisket, maybe 3 ounces.  $10.  That's more than 50 bucks a pound and quite a bit more than very well considered bbq joints like Little Miss BBQ here in the valley or Franklin's in Austin.  I might be willing to give JJ's another try if they weren't squeezing a penny so hard it squealed like a pig."}
{"text":"Awesome ribs - go for the spicy BBQ sauce, it's not that hot and I'm a lightweight. Friendly fast service."}
{"text":"The BBQ was really good and hade an awesome smokey flavor! Really good lunch specials too, I got a breaded catfish sandwich with a side and drink for $7. The girls working there were super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to say I was underwhelmed by this place. The service was good and the gentleman working was so nice but we weren't wowed by the food."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star only because you can't give it 0. All the food we ordered was in ziplock bags in a warmer. I've never seen this in a restaurant. The mac and cheese was bland and dry. We took one bite out of the baked beans and threw them away. The only good thing about this restaurant was that everyone was very cordial.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very basic little place. The potato salad with store-bought. The barbecue was just okay."}
{"text":"Best place I've been to in years, very homie feeling , nice people food is amazing you can't go wrong with anything there. Everyone's experience is different, so you just have to go try it out for yourself to know what's good and what's not.................  by the way Superman came to visit JJs  stay prayed up and motivate Godbless all of your comments"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some barbecue so I searched on Yelp and this place came up at the top of the list. Ordered a brisket dinner plate with corn and mac & cheese. The brisket was a real healthy portion that was moist and juicy with plenty of smoke flavor! Mac & cheese was very cheesy and tasteful and a corn on the cob was piping hot, buttery and had a little kick of seasoning on it. I spoke to Jo The co-owner that seems like a very nice lady that helped me with the menu being that it was my first time. I'm going to put this place at the top of my list! I'll probably be coming here 2-3 times a week now!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating JJ's Lousiana BBQ for a work-related lunch last week. People: this food will change the way you think about BBQ. The brisket (with spicy BBQ sauce) spoke to me in ways only my Creator has, and the second round of pulled pork made me realize that no matter how bad things get, good BBQ will instantly change your demeanor. Huge shout out to the crew at JJ's for making world class bbq in Glendale."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Real southern barbeque.  Also has a food truck.  Real tough to find entrance is on 56th not Glendale.  Easy to miss.  Turn south on to 56th.  Please don't miss this great BBQ"}
{"text":"This summer I took a trip across the country and stopped at all the best bbq places I could find between here and Michigan. This is the only bbq restaurant I've found in the state that can hold up against Midwest bbq. The smoke flavor is awesome and the seasoning is always perfect. It was the smell of the pit outside that brought my girlfriend and me in. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal, took my Brother this time and he enjoyed every bite. The addiction is real my friends..."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD! He even takes cards as well ($1 extra charge to swipe) but even the swipe is worth it. I got the pulled pork sandwich minus the bread for allergy reasons and mixed the two sauces he had. I'm in heaven and drooling while I'm eating this. 10/10 will recommend again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and the food was delicious! I basically tried almost everything on the menu. The customer service was genuine and prompt. They check on you throughout your dining experience to be sure you're taken care of. I was so hungry that I forgot to take pictures prior to stuffing my hole and I was completely blown away to learn that they'd only been in business for about six months. I will have pictures from my next visit; promise. In fact the yelp reviews and the pictures are what sold me on coming here. The mac n cheese was on point, rib tips were a go, deep fried catfish was tasty, fresh and hot. I say fresh because you could tell the grease wasn't old and the fish hadn't been sitting under a hot lamp. The potato salad was bomb and even the BBQ sauce was good. For dessert, I tried the peach cobbler and the banana pudding...the banana pudding won! I would recommend having the peach cobbler served warm with side of ice cream. Overall, great hometown atmosphere with a simple but mouth watering menu. I loved the small business and authentic feel to the restaurant. I'm definitely going back to try the pulled pork, chicken, brisket and corn on the cob. This review approved by a gentlemen born and raised in GA."}
{"text":"As one great man said \"Put some south in your mouth\".  And this my friends would be the place to do so.  My husband had a rib meal. (Meals come with 2 sides)Ribs with a smoke ring, seasoning, a tenderness that did not need sauce in ANY shape way or form (I kept asking for bites). (They do have tasty sauces tho) I digress.... Baked beans with meat and bbq flavor that is smokey. Corn on the cob with seasoning that's was tender and flavorful. I had the pulled pork plate with Mac n cheese and grean beans with potatoes. The beans brought me back to childhood. My mama and mamaws cooking. They have a spicy and a mild sauce. I mixed both. The sauce was Smokey, sweet and very nice addition to my pulled pork. For desert, banana nut and strawberry cheesecake pound cakes. I also had tropical punch koolaid to drink. We traded half way thru eating. Go, run, take you man, take your girl, take your mama, take your granny. This is the real thing. Southern cooking at its finest. I am from Tennessee and I approve this message."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place just hidden on Glendale Ave...Very friendly staff and the food the bomb."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ tips with Mac n cheese!! Yummy!! So glad they finally have a storefront. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and boy was it huge! The BBQ sauce has just the right flavor and heat. Thanks guys, great quiet  atmosphere and delicious food."}
{"text":"Update - There was an unintended consequence to finding great Bar BQ.  I raved to my wife how great my brisket sandwich was that evening.  She said \"I'm happy YOU had a great lunch.  Where is mine?\"  Did you know JJ sells whole smoked brisket?    He was back for lunch today.  I called yesterday asking for a whole uncut brisket.  Got it today wrapped and iced.  Will present peace offerings tonight."}
{"text":"This place is so underrated. Don't be hindered by the location, five star BBQ. JJ will fill your plate as high as possible! He makes his own sauce, Louisiana style!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Az., and were looking for some good bbq.  I stumbled upon this place on Yelp. After reading all the good reviews I decided to try it. Well , lets just say I was highly disappointed! Overpriced for the food that didn't have much season to it. They charged me $8 for one piece of catfish  (no flavor) it came with about 6 fries and a dinner roll. Smh!   I guess I will continue to look elsewhere for some good bbq!  I'm mad that I wasted my money! :("}
{"text":"I do not have to words as to how AMAZING this place is, their ribs were fall off the bone perfect and the brisket... no joke I had legit tears, that's how great it was. And their sauces.. man i could drink the stuff. The owner and his wife that own this place are so sweet and hospitable I felt like I was family. We will definitely be back.. most likely next week.. or more likely tomorrow."}
{"text":"I saw the yelp reviews and drive past JJs often. I decided to stop today for lunch for me and hubby. I got the 2 meat dinner for each of us. \"JJ\", I'm just assuming that's the guy's name.... Was very friendly and had me taste the meat. The ribs were so yummy, but the star was the brisket! I don't even eat brisket, but do now! it was sooo tender, juicy, smoky and good! The chicken is a thigh and leg and was very good, too. Each meal came with potato salad and beans. Those were very good, too. I highly recommend this bbq truck, in my opinion, it's better than the bbq sit down restaurants close by!"}
{"text":"Man oh man!  The owner of \"What's Fresh\" and I spotted these guys on Peoria.  Suckers for BBQ, we had to stop even though it was only 10:30 in the morning.  You ever eat BBQ for brunch?  Well we couldn't stop eating.  This is the real deal.  It's not dry, overcooked meat slathered with sauce.  It's tender, moist and delicious right out of the smoker.  And this guy is a Christian brother, meaning feeding others is SERVICE to him, not just a JOB.  Not many food trucks I\"m going to ride my motorcycle around town searching for, but JJ's is one of 'em!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for sure. I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing. The peach cobbler was also amazing. Bottom line is... I wasn't disappointed at all.  I think they just found a new regular customer right here."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq place I've been to. Meat is super tender and the sauce is amazing. The staff is really friendly too. The Mac and cheese could be a little creamier though but that's just my preference. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by Park West for Food Truck Friday a few weeks ago.  It was about 115 degrees, but I am a food truck fan.  All the big name trucks were there: tacos, lobster rolls, juice, coffee and all the rest.  The first thing I appreciated, they were set up in shade.  Next, was the smell, the definitive smoky aroma that you associate with southern BBQ.  These guys know their Q!!! My wife and I split the brisket plate.  This is real brisket!! None of the \"lean\" counterfeits out there.  There is no lean in brisket!! This is the best brisket I have ever had!! I went to Rudy's last week and it was good, but it wasn't JJ's good!! Portions were healthy sized and the brisket was cut the perfect thickness.  Temperature was perfect and the meat was soft and tender.  Both sauces were very good.  I loved the beans.  I am a fan of beans with a lot of meat, like a chili.  JJ's are a little bit more southern inspired, not so much southwest.  I loved the spice and texture.  Lots of meat added.  Very satisfying.  I was sweating a lot from how hot it was outside and I had a little sweat going from the tang of the sauce and beans; all good.  Love these guy's personalities and knowledge of smoked meats and BBQ.  A great experience all the way around.  I am excited to go again tomorrow.  I understand they will be setting up the trailer at 83rd Ave and T-bird.  Going with a big appetite!! I know they will fill me up!!"}

{"text":"James the owner came out to our business today and catered to all 200 employees.  What a great experience!   I would highly recommend them to anyone.  The food was amazing.  Chicken pulled pork and brisket was very good.  He is such a great guy, stayed an hour after we anticipated because employees and their families kept showing up.  He made multiple trips to get more food because everyone loved it.  Thank You James, we will be calling again!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for BBQ and Fish! The service is awesome and the food amazing."}
{"text":"Loved this BBQ Joint- The owners were super friendly and helped us choose items with out being pushy. The two of us share their 3 meat plate (BBQ Ribs, pulled pork, and Chicken) with their beans and Mac-n-cheese. We also got an extra side of string beans. The meat was tasty! We were impressed that the meat fell off the bones, almost before getting the bone to our mouths. Their sauces are yummy, we liked their spicy the best! The sides that we tried were great, just like grandma makes! Everything was so good we had to try the peach cobbler even though we were full...let me tell you, that did not disappoint either!  JJ's has earned our business can't wait to try their catfish!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Lunch was good!  I had pulled chicken, it is a little spicy just so you know, cole slaw was just normal fare.  He had the beef sandwich and it was very good.  He said the ice tea was good and he doesn't ever drink tea!  The fun part was I had red kool aid made with sugar!  Hadn't had that in years.  The owner/cook came right up to the table and talked to everyone.  Very nice clean place to eat and the food is good!  Try it, you'll like it!  Closed on Sunday Monday now."}
{"text":"As a transplant from Austin Texas, I have been lookin for a good BBQ place in Phoenix. I never realized how difficult of a task that would be! Well I found a fantastic place at a farmers market of all places. As soon as I arrived at the market, I smelt the wood burning. not long after that I noticed the massive cast iron lung smoker. I ordered some moist brisket to go and hoped for the best. I figure it a place can make a good brisket, then they can make anything. The brisket was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful. I took some bbq for the side, even though the meat didn't need it. Im sure I will be visiting JJ's again at their home location in Glendale to sample some other dishes. Who knows.... they may even rank up there with Austin's famous Franklin's BBQ. The only difference between franklin's and JJ's, I didn't have to stand in line for 2 hours to get JJ's. I better go soon before the lines build up!!"}
{"text":"Great bbq, juicy, moist, fatty all the best parts of bbq. I'm writing my review not even 15 minutes after receiving it because of how awesome James and his son were. They se like the kindest of folk and even on a day where he couldn't take the truck out due to his wife being sick, he met us with the bbq near our location so we could still enjoy his food. the lack of reviews is perplexing because this business deserves plenty of attention, go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket dinner which comes with 2 sides, I chose Mac n cheese and baked beans. The brisket was 1 slice and two half slices which were very dry with a crumbly texture. The flavor was ok but must have been in a steam table too long making it grey and dry. The roll was similar as it was dry and crumbly. The mac n cheese lacked flavor and again dry is the only word I can find to describe as the mac had claimed the moisture rights from the dish only to become mushy. The saving grace of the plate was the beans which had great flavor and spice to move my rating from 2 stars to 3. The service was great, the place is very clean but a $14 lunch should be better than what was served. My guess is the brisket was good when it came out of the pit but the lack of holding ovens and techniques killed it. I will go back to try the ribs in hope of a better lunch and wish the best for JJ's as they seem like nice folks."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Delicious pork and brisket! I'll def be back to try the cobbler as I hear it's to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place the food is absolutely delicious at  JJ louisiana BBQ were the food is mouth watering please come out and treat yourself to a nice southern style favorable meal they are located at 5601 W Glendale,  AZ, suite B"}
{"text":"The food is finger licking good ! The best part is when the owners and their family treat us as if we were one of there own . Super friendly environment . They know what there doing . And there beans are delicious"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!! The bbq pulled pork sandwich was so delish I had to use a few extra napkins lol. You should really try this bbq you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Portions were large and the meat was smoked. Peach cobbler was very good. I added some butter and coupled with ice cream was amazing. I got the 3 meat dinner with brisket, chicken, and rib tips. I was a happy camper for 2 nights. I will return."}
{"text":"Tastes like home.  As a fat retired cop, I consider myself a BBQ expert.  When you walk in and see a big ol' jug of sweet tea on the counter, you know the establishment is legit.  All the traditional smoked foods and sides in a hole in the wall corner of Glendale.  By far the best meats in the area.  Not a chain, just a good ol' boy from the South.  With a strong faith in Jesus, JJ and his wife have setup an oasis in the desert.  Complete with homemade peach cobbler, your meal will be amazing.  Ours was..."}
{"text":"We tried 2 different dinner plates, the brisket with chicken and the other with the beef tip and pulled pork. The meat is amazing! The spicy sauce was really good. Loved their Mac n cheese. I was expecting a bit of bigger portions, but still decent size. I will def go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a barbecue place and decided to come to JJs over Bobby Q's... A great decision!  We weren't overly hungry so we split a three meat sampler with the rib tips, pulled pork, and chicken. We had beans and green beans for sides. Both sides had meat in them and they were absolutely delicious. The baked beans were not what I expected, by that I mean they were not sweet like you would normally get a restaurant or out of the can, but they were packed with flavor.  The rib tips had a great flavor but were a bit dry, but we also came at the end of the day so that might be the reason for that. The pulled pork was delicious even without adding the homemade barbecue sauce, and the chicken was by far the best of the three. It was not overdone at all, perfectly tender.   The restaurant was very clean and the owner, James, was very friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the staff is outstanding. They made u feel like u were part of their family. Their brisket was juicey and delicious. Will definetly visit again."}
