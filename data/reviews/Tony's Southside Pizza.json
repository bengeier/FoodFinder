{"text":"Somehow I always manage to stretch my birthday into a three-week event..... Tony's Southside was my absolute favorite of all my birthday dinners this year!  We ended up getting a couple cocktails, meatball appetizer, three pizzas (my favorite was the prosciutto and hot peppers), a beer, glass of wine, dessert and one cup of coffee. The bill was almost $100. Although I wasn't the one footing the bill that evening, I can honestly say that this place is worth it!   The ambience and the homey-friendliness of the husband/wife/sister running the place was incredible and the food was so great. They use a Sunday-style meat sauce rather than pizza sauce which has so much depth and pairs perfectly with the sweetness in their pizza dough. I am drooling remembering it.   Keep in mind, their pizza is not meant to be scarfed down but savored and appreciated; there is so much flavor and texture going on. I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Went here to have a late dinner with my girlfriend, really nice looking spot with a very charming little bar. Family owned I'm assuming and and bartender was as nice as she was slow. Our appetizer came out before our drinks, odd. If you are looking for a value do not go here!!! 8 oz of frozen cavatelli $20- again everybody was very nice but it is so so so slow in here, just terrible. I would not go here again and I wouldn't recommend anyone else does- also the cook was walking around the dining room in a sleeveless shirt( think that he was the owner) either way that's gross- get it together Tony-"}
{"text":"Is this place a joke? Our server went on and on about how everything is made from scratch. My $18 pizza was the size of 1 regular slice of pizza. Again, the server said \"it's all made from scratch. It's not Dominoes\". I've had many great made from scratch pizzas that didn't cost $18/slice. This one must have been made from gold. It tasted like DiGiorno pizza. All I could do was laugh. I thought I was being pranked. It's also only open 2 days a week? This has to be a front for something. There's only room for 6 people in the dining room and I can't imagine anyone going there twice unless they want to show their friends how weird this place is."}
{"text":"Friend-of-a-friend brought us to Tony's Southside a few weeks back...kind of skeptical upon arrival, but that was quickly out the window after the warm welcome, great service and terrific meal we had.  Be forewarned...the space is very small and intimate, but don't let that scare you away.  The old-time feel of the decor and the rich wood tones makes for a very unique setting for a meal.  The six of us sat at the bar and spent the entire evening conversing with the owners behind the bar and in the kitchen.  It is very clear his couple really cares about the quality of what they are serving their patrons, from hand-crafted cocktails to special-order dishes they were accommodating in every way.  We sampled a number of their Greco-Roman dishes that were all shareable. Our salad had a tangy oil and vinegar dressing with crumbled blue cheese...very zippy start to the meal!  We followed that with an order of Italian meatballs.  They were hearty and their sauce also had a slight tang to it (more on the vinegar side than sweet, which we like). The Piccolo pizza was very small (personal pan pizza sized) but the flavor was spot on...artichokes, red peppers, olives set atop the same tangy red sauce.  Finally, I was able to sample the lamb meatballs with yogurt sauce which were mild and perfectly cooked.  Overall this place was a great \"hidden gem\" of a find...so glad we ended up here that night!  One last word of warning, they are a CASH ONLY establishment, so come well stocked (although there are ATMs close by).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off, this is not a pizza joint..it's a dimly lit, intimate small Italian eatery/bar.  This place is only open Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 7pm.  The interior is dark...very dark.  So much so that when you walk in it's intimidating because you cannot see a damn thing with all the dark wood in the place.  Little candles on each table.  Love the cozy high-top tables for two.  We ordered the homemade pierogi and it was delicious.  Then it was time to choose a pizza or an entree.  Tony's pizza is ONLY served in 6\" individual \"piccolini\" size.  They start at $8 and go up to $14.  Kinda pricey for a 6\" pie...The pizza tasted very good, and the server told us everything is made from scratch.  The cavatelli was very good but was it worth $18?  No, not for the portion size.  But going to Tony's is a great experience if you want to have a drink at a dimly lit, intimate bar and have a quiet conversation.  More than 40+ types of bottled beer (and ONLY bottled beer...no tap).  Pretty good wine selection although they don't have a wine list.  And if you're looking for the bathroom like I was, look for the \"Scooby Doo\" panels to press on and find it."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem. Very cute and cozy, for all the right reasons. Food was authentic ... Definitely get the spanakopita and the cocktails are made fresh. Our waitress/bartender was a bit frazzled but cute all the same."}
{"text":"I lived in Tremont for 4 years before I made my way to Tony's, and for good reason.  This place is only open Friday and Saturday nights, and it's easy to walk right past it.  When you open the front door, you walk into a old world, dark paneled room with a long bar, piano and 25 seats squeezed into the tiny space.  Tony's is a family restaurant, passed down from the previous generation and marrying both Grecian and Italian food.  Let's start with cocktails - their cocktail list is changed seasonally.  We were surprised with how well balanced they were, and they have a rule - if your drink comes with fruit, don't waste it.  They are not kidding!  The fruit in the cocktails was unbelievable, truly delicious (especially the cherries).    As other reviewers have stated, their portion sizes for food are on the smaller side.  The meatball appetizer is 2 meatballs - of a normal size.  We thought they were standard, but not spectacular.  The pizzas are 6\" in size, and yes, they really are small.  We did really enjoy our pizza, the crust was really delightful and the toppings were fresh.  I also enjoyed a lime, ricotta, gelatin dessert that was odd - but fantastic (getting better with each bite).   The best part of the restaurant are the people who own it and work there.  This is truly a family restaurant, they are proud of the food, the beverages and the care that they put into the business.  We are looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"I really really wanted this place to be my favorite restaurant in Tremont.   Decidedly not so. As everyone has mentioned, it's a TINY room, very dark and very cool. I want to go back for cocktails on a snowy night in December.   Just don't eat there. Trust me. The menu is (from a design viewpoint) kind of a joke. There are about 6 pages of menu and about 6 pages of blah blah talking about how everything is Old World, made from scratch etc. Listen Bartender Lady, if your food can't speak for itself, no amount of text is going to convince me otherwise. Me and my girlfriend went on a Friday night and were very disappointed in the experience. We got the meatball app, which is literally TWO meatballs, smaller than golf balls, for $8. Friends, these are not worth four dollars a piece. Bland bland bland, much like everything else we had. So we had 3 cocktails total, the two meatballs, two 'piccolini' pizzas and a pasta entree. $85 and we were still hungry when we left.   I hate to be the world's biggest cynic, but I have a really REALLY hard time believing that everything is made from scratch in a restaurant that is open two nights a week for ten hours total over those two days. I've worked in the business for a long time, there's simply no way they've making all that stuff fresh and it really doesn't taste like it. I really don't mind paying good money but it's gotta be worth it and Tony's is just not worth it. I've honestly had better Italian at Brio. Sad but true."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by a recommendation from a bar goer next to our party. From the outside, it doesn't look like very much, but inside its very nicely appointed. Interior is very classy with dark wood paneling, piano, and mood lighting. There are a few tables but are placed very closely together, it's a bit small inside but that shouldn't deter you from this place.  The cocktails are seasonal and from what I've tried they were all very good. Reasonably priced and packed with complex flavors and booze. I don't remember the name of the drink that I ordered but I can assure you it was very delicious! I also tried my friend's drinks and they were equally as good! While we were there, we also tried their lamb meat balls and pizza. The meat balls were very good and so was the pizza but the sizes are on the small size for the price.   Very happy to come to know about this place. Will add it to my rotation of cocktail spots!"}
{"text":"This rating is for an  extremely bizarre experience me and my fiance had their this last winter.   I was back in town for a College friends wedding and me and my then girlfriend were staying in lovely Tremont! After a night of catching up with friends we got back to our Airbnb and decided some pizza sounded pretty delicious, as it usually does after a few drinks. We called Tony's Southside Pizza as it had some great reviews to see if we could put in an order and come pick it up. We were told over the phone that they don't do that, and we'd have to come in and place an order. Thought it was strange for a pizza place not to take orders over the phone but nonetheless we walked over to the cozy, dimly lit restaurant.  When we arrived we were ushered over to a table next to a fake fireplace which was nice and warm. And then the waitress/bartender started in on the spiel on how everything is made from scratch and organic and blah blah blah. Oh and also, that they're cash only... So I got up, put my winter layers back on and walked across the street to an ATM. Get back with the cash and we put an order in for one of the pizzas she recommended. We order a couple drinks while the pizza is cooking also explaining to the waitress that we'd like the pizza to go as its getting late.   Finally the pizza comes out, and it looks like one of those little personal sized digiorno  pizzas you'd get at a ball game. The waitress brought it out on a plate and refused to put it in a box until we both ate a piece there,.....super uncomfortable as she stood there and stared at us taking our first bite. After we finished half our $20 personal sized pizza the waitress begrudgingly boxed it up. For two beers and a tiny pizza we left there paying almost $40.00, and still hungry.    I feel like I'm being pretty harsh, but honestly this place was awful. Would've done much better going to the grocery store for a frozen pizza twice the size and using my debit card."}
{"text":"A true treasure in Tremont. The best individual pizzas around town. The service is always great and the family who owns the restaurant is a pleasure to talk to. My personal favorite is the centurian pizza. If you happen to stop into Tonys be sure to end your meal with the cheesecake, you will not be disappointed. Don't forget to check out the hand crafted cocktails."}
{"text":"If I could give this disgrace of a place less than 1 star, I would. My friends & I were trying a few different places in Tremont & we were going to go into this place. Before we could even walk in the door, one of the \"regulars\" (which i'm assuming by the other reviews was the owner bc he was the guy with the long braided beard), started verbally harassing myself & my 3 friends. It was so confusing & out of nowhere. So obviously we did not eat or drink at this place & I will not look twice in Tony's direction again. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to five 5 stars to preserve how good of a secret this place is.   Don't be fooled by the reviews. This isn't a regular pizza place, it's a very romantic and intimate restaurant that is more of an experience, taking you back to another time and the feel of real home cooking. It isn't the place to just pick up a pizza or be in-and-out.  I went there on a date and it was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. First of all, super cozy and intimate. The waitress comes out and talks to you about the wines, how it connects to her family's history...they bring out drinks. Then you order appetizer and food. We had meatballs, cavatelli and bread. The portions weren't huge but when you eat slowly they were very filling and satisfying. It was a little over $50 but we left full, satisfied, and we had a wonderful night, it was like we lost track of time.  A real gem and important in a place of quick restaurants where everyone is on their cell phone the whole time and orders everything at once. HIGHLY recommend for dates or great conversation dinners with good people.  Also, make sure to call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is something else. Went there thinking we would find a diamond in the rough. Turned out to be just rough. The people were very nice and like the other reviews told us how everything was made from scratch. I'm not doubting it was once made from scratch, but it was probably 3 months ago...ordered meatballs..both Italian and Greek...both were cold and obviously previously frozen...for 5 small meatballs it was $16...we got 2 dishes that were described as pull apart bread....both tasted exactly the same and room temperature and again totaled $16...we then got 3 \"pizzas\" and a pasta dish....the pizzas were the size of a Red Baron single serve pizza that ranged from 12-14 dollars....they were average at the very best and the pasta dish was described as \"terrible\". The \"chef\" came out and asked how everything was...a guest at our tabled questioned why everything was so expensive for what you got...the \"chef\" who was wearing a faded Tim Couch jersey and had a 1 foot beard said very cocky like \"we serve quality and if you want a 12 inch 5.99 pizza go to little ceasars\"....just so he knows you can go to Dante down the street and pay the same amount and get Michelin Star food....because you put cheese and rosemary on a piece of dough that tasted like it was dusted with sugar does not make it quality...  There was no heat, the bill was $157, and this place should be ashamed of itself....I am 33 years old and have eaten in and around Cleveland for a long time and have never posted a Yelp review...do not be fooled by these people ....it is a disgrace....to wrap it up, we literally went to another restaurant after to get more food because we left hungry and felt like someone stole our money........."}
{"text":"Even living in Tremont for the past 4 years, I had no idea this place was open until walking by on a Friday night and saw people sitting outside. After getting the low down on the place, I knew I had to give this place a try and I am so glad I did. Everything is made fresh and the crust is to DIE for. I also highly recommend trying a cocktail too! Our waitress, Valerie, was a sweetheart and made us feel like part of the family. Hours and days are limited and the place is very quaint so make a reservation! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place and don't get here enough. If you're looking for a high value meal, Tony's is not for you. It's great for cocktails and its low key ambiance. It's family owned and they are super sweet. I won't lie that service is not rapid so please don't come with the idea that you'll have dinner in an hour and be gone. You must come to relax with someone who makes good conversation, enjoys a strong and delicious cocktail, and has a pocket full of cash. Sorry, no credit cards."}
{"text":"Uhh...am I in the right place?  This place may catch you off guard.  The sign and the name basically say \"Tremont dive with crappy pizza\" but when you enter you're flanked by flickering candles, dark stained wood and a mini grand piano!?  Uhh, what?    Picture the Velvet Tango Room back room without the $15 drinks and with excellent small plates.    It's a strange bar with just as strange hours . It's only open on weekends but if you can catch it, it's well worth the stop.  The bartenders are quick and responsive and you don't feel out-of place by just ordering a Miller Light.  I would like to note they do have a decent wine selection though so it's the perfect place for a night cap.  The food is all very good and typical of your finer dining establishments.  The pizza is delicious as are the other appetizers I've tried.    What would I change?  Well..maybe the name and the sign.  They just don't live up to the higher-end establishment that you find inside."}
{"text":"All of my favorite cocktail bars have become way too popular. I blame Yelp and I blame myself for raving about them on Yelp but regardless, my point is that the best cocktail bars generally become known about town... so my question is why this place hasn't? Honestly, I never would have even considering stopping in this place from the street view. There's a glowing neon blue light making it look like the divey sort of place you don't really want to wander in aimlessly. However, after arriving 15 minutes early for a reservation at Ushabu, we were encouraged to stop in here for a drink by the hostess while waiting out our reservation. The symbiosis ended up working out really well as we felt immediately welcomed into the space by the bartender, Elenny. Elenny is exactly the type of bartender that everyone wants to return to... personable without being nosy, kind without being smarmy and she makes a kickass cocktail. It turns out that all their specialty cocktails are designed by her! We chose two, and were really impressed with both of them. One of them had a mild balsamic undertone which was really understated, but a welcome surprise! Elenny was aware of the fact that we had a short time to enjoy our cocktails and had our check ready to go when we were, which is MUCH appreciated as most diners hate being held captive by the check most of all. We unfortunately didn't have a chance to try the food, but honestly I'd return here just for the cocktails as there's a really mellow vibe that makes me want to revisit. Will I come to regret writing this Yelp review when I return to find this place has become overcrowded just like my other favorite cocktail bars? Perhaps, but it's worth it as I'm thankful I was referred over there by the host next door and I do hope others will give it a try as well."}
