{"text":"We love their samosas...beef and chicken.  We live down the street and indulge whenever we have people over and they are always devoured."}
{"text":"Rajkapuri's Paan & Snacks has long been a staple for East African goods, a convenience store/restaurant if you would. 

For years I heard from my friends about the legendary donairs and recently I finally got to indulge. The beef donair I sampled was an exciting experience. The donair meat was seasoned well and hot in the pita. The toppings were raw cubes of white onion, tomato and their signature spicy tamarind sauce. It is this sauce which gives the meal its sweet, tart and tangy bite. 

Other then donairs Raj's offers a wide variety of other food ranging from various paans to other east african snacks, meals and sweets. 

Nice place if you are looking for any of the above."}

{"text":"My uncle is a fan of this place, either he's doesn't know what real Indian food is or he's losing his marbles. The family visited this restaurant a few months ago and I was not present, but I thought I'd post a review anyway because of the food poisoning I received.

Had a doggy bag with daal curry with rice & naan that was brought to me. The curry lacked garlic and seasoning, most importantly didn't taste fresh at all. I won't fill you in on what happened after that, long story short I was very sick for about 3-4 days. Food was either contaminated or was prepared days before and served to customers. This was the first time I got food poisoning in years, almost never do I feel sick after eating a meal, but I did on this occasion."}
