{"text":"Just had my first Waffle Crush experience and it was out of this world!  My friend told me that Waffle Crush was going to be near where I live today so I took the family to have waffles for dinner. We were all blown away.  We all tried a different waffle and they were all beyond phenomenal.  My wife tried the cream cheese with strawberries on her waffle and I had the Nutella Biscoff with marshmallows. All I can say is wow! The lady at the window was very nice and provided us with punchcards for future free waffles and also gave me a sampling of the biscofff because I didn't know what it was. Not only is the food great, but the service is superb.

If you are a fan of gourmet waffles, you MUST hunt this truck down and try it."}
{"text":"Owner is dedicated and delivers great food with the highest quality service.  Try the nutella waffle, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried the waffles today and we were not disappointed :) delicious and the waffles came out quickly . We will definitely be trying the different waffles they have to offer soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by office max this morning and OH MY GOD I saw the truck!!! The beautiful pink truck and my mind was like \"IS THAT THE TRUCK!?!?\" I picked up some pens, and went straight over to purchase a waffle. But first, I was a newbie, so I stepped back for a couple minutes and watched how things operated. 

There were people waiting, and I saw someone walk up to the window and ordered. So I'm like, oh that's easy! I was initially going to get the \"Nana,\" but I decided to try something new and got the \"Berry\" instead because it had a biscoff spread. I read reviews and saw people were raving about Biscoff, so I decided to give it a try, not knowing what it was. HOLY. MOLY. It was DIVINE. (I loved it so much I actually went to my Winco and purchased a crunchy Biscoff jar!) Biscoff is the new Nutella basically. It's ground up Biscoff cookies (the one they serve on airplane flights) and a little oil. And it tastes sooooo good. Tastes like ground up graham cracker spread. 

They type your order in the iPad, ask for your name and you can pay cash or card. I paid cash, but if you paid with a credit card they'll swipe it on the iPad and it'll give you tip percentage options. I made sure to ask for my waffle in a to-go container first because it usually comes out on a plate, and they don't offer it unless you ask for the to-go box. 

The waffle itself is very thick and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It isn't like your typical waffle, I did some research and instead of a batter it is a yeast dough with imported pearl sugar mixed in to give a caramelized outside and fluffy sweet inside.  It's a very sturdy waffle that's piled with generous amounts of topping, in my case, crunchy Biscoff spread, strawberries and a scoop of a luxuriously thick homemade whipped cream. You definitely need a fork and knife to wolf this sucker down. Don't be fooled, though, it may look small but I was definitely full before I finished the entire waffle. 

It was a little wait for the waffle, as they do make it fresh, and a little pricey, but it was worth it. I was hooked, so I went on their Facebook and they do multiple locations every day. Be sure to follow them and stalk them to get your next LÃ­ege waffle. I know I will!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.....crispy on the outside, and a soft warm cooked yet, doughy in the middle.  Topped with fruit and nutella.....yum!"}
{"text":"I finally managed to get my hands (and taste buds) on one of these glorious waffles and I loved every inch of them. My family and I tried The Berry, The Scoop, and we made one with raspberries and cream cheese frosting. All three were fantastic, but the first two were by far the best. I could've used a little more cream cheese frosting on mine (it was drizzled over the raspberries). However they pile on the whip cream and vanilla bean ice cream so there's plenty to go around. Waffles themselves have a nice sweet edge, and are crispy on the outside while being almost gooey and dense on the inside. It's delicious. Like, really delicious. 

If you haven't tracked these people down yet, start right away! 

(Biscoff is a spread made from gingerbread-like cookies that is fantastic, just so you know.)"}
{"text":"I love this truck and I've purchased food from them at Power Ranch Farmer's Market on Wednesday nights as well as the Gilbert Feastival in Towne Square on Friday nights.  The staff they hire are pleasant young people with great customer service skills so kudos to management.  I never thought of a waffle being dinner before, but I can say that I am now a believer.  They are mouth watering, delicious, and very filling with a variety of toppings.

I can say they have the best waffles, but I can't say which one is my favorite.  I'll just have to keep trying all of them I guess!"}
{"text":"So these waffles are awesome, definitely worth the drive.  My wife, son and I each got different toppings and all of them were delicious.  They even had fresh peaches from one of the local farms.  Waffle Crush just got added to my list of places to take guests to when they're visiting AZ."}
{"text":"WOW! This was my first time eating from a food truck and I can't wait to do it again! It was insanely delirious and fresh! We got the Berry waffle and Mallow waffle. To Die For!!! Don't be fooled, they are very filling!"}
{"text":"Decent. A little to sweet for my taste. Also seemed a little pricey. My biggest complaint is no restroom. As parents who are potty training it was frustrating when our son had to use the restroom and you don't allow public use and he had an accident. I also wanted a pumpkin waffle which you didn't have. Probably won't be going back but it was cool to try."}
{"text":"One of the best waffles I've ever had. I'll be trying my hand at making one of these, but I doubt it will be as good as this. I got the waffle with Biscoff spread. It was truly delicious. I'll be heading back to the Farmers Market to get another one this weekend."}
{"text":"Loved the Waffle Truck! It is totally worth it! I got the banana Nutella with fresh cream and it was to die for! Hopefully I run into them again!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Today I had a new (to me) waffle experience. Listed as a favorite on the menu board of this food truck which I found located at the Peoria Farmer's Market, was The Berry Waffle. It was a hot day so some fresh fruit sounded like a good idea.... Besides, since it is called \"a favorite\" how could I go wrong??!!  My initial reaction when I saw my waffle was one of disappointment. I felt that the size of the waffle, for what I paid, was pretty small. After starting to eat it my mind definitely changed on that. The waffle is made differently than your typical home-made (air-filled) waffle. Texture is pleasantly dense. On top was a wonderful Biscoff Sauce. Had I known ahead of time that this sauce was made with gingerbread cookies, I absolutely would NOT have tried the waffle! YUCK!!  I ate it without knowing that and can not say enough of how good it tasted. (Don't tell Mom that I tried something I have always complained about and now like it!!) Piled on top of that, I enjoyed a whole bunch of very neatly placed macerated strawberry slices. Top all that with whipped cream and I was very full by the time I finished just 3/4 of my little gem.  (I am taking a \"settle the stomach\" break while I write this!!) 

Staff was friendly and my wait time was only a few minutes.....very appropriate, in my opinion.  This is definitely a Do-Over meal for me!! It works as a meal or as a desert. Whenever you eat it you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Well, there are (at least) two new Waffle Trucks in town: Waffle Love AZ and Waffle Crush. Both have opened within the last month-ish and they both seem to like parking in my back yard (not complaining!) Being lovers of waffles (particularly waffles of the amazingly sweet, sugary leige-sort), we of course needed to give both a whirl.

I believe that I read that Waffle Crush is run by some ladies from Queen Creek. We've visited them most often in the parking lot of the American Leadership Academy at Greenfield and Pecos - it is a pretty diabolical location as it is directly on our way pretty much any/everywhere as we head to the freeway. My young son now identifies that intersection as \"Waffle\" any time we pass it. They have also joined the Power Ranch Farmers Market one Wednesday, which was phenomenal as my grandmother could walk over to grab a waffle with my son (nothing else is really within close walking distance here) 

Location: The two locations we've visited have been nice - American Leadership Academy's parking lot has been empty of normal traffic during the times that we've gone, which means that the only cars there are there for the Waffle truck. There's plenty of space to park and a big clear area around the truck itself where you wait. There is also a nice park just across the street, which can be a scenic place to enjoy your waffles if you don't enjoy the eat-standing-up-or-in-your car experience. The Power Ranch Farmer's Market was also nice, with a big grassy area nearby and sidewalk on the side of the truck where you ordered. Both options were well lit and they often have several lawn chairs set up for some guests to sit in while they wait. 

Process: The lines are long - this is a fact. The waffles take awhile - also a fact. You generally order when you get to the window, they take your name, run your credit card on the iPad. There is a spot to provide a tip BUT I noticed that they only offer you set tip options (15%, 20%, 25%) ... not a huge fan of this as it is not a table service restaurant (they are handing me my food through a window) and so a 20 or 25% tip is WAY HIGH for the amount of actual service provided. Even 15% is a lot when 3 waffles will run you almost $25, which means that you're leaving a $4 or $5 tip for the lowest percentages. 

The Menu: Your basic option is the yum-tastic Liege Waffle. They do something unique in that you can order a chocolate-filled waffle, which seems to be a waffle that is somehow layered with chocolate in the middle; yummy but SO sweet. They have some great suggested waffles - the \"Berry\" is my go to, with Biscoff, Strawberries, and Whipped Cream (the thick, real whipped cream that is almost like icecream but soft and a perfect topping) \"Nana\" is another favorite in our family, with Bananas, Nutella, and Whipped Cream. They have the \"Mellow\" which is s'moresish with chocolate filling and toasted marsmallows, and the perfect option for my son and grandmother who don't go overboard - the Cinnamon Sugar, which is simply the waffle rolled in a Cinnamon Sugar mix. 

The Goods: The waffles are delicious Liege waffles that use special waffle irons that caramelize the sugar on the waffles providing a crispier, sweet exterior that contrasts the soft and fluffy interior perfectly. There is something to their batter that isn't my favorite - a slightly sharp after taste that sometimes puts me off, but is usually pretty well masked by the toppings so it's not that big of a deal. The toppings are delicious and the combinations they suggest are all creative and tasty.

Service: We've been several times and the faces seem to always be the same people, which is nice! They go out of their way to be friendly, and on one night where we arrived early when there wasn't much of a line, we even got a little overview and sample of the Biscoff spread form one of the proprietors. 

Overall - They seem to have a good grasp on their concept and provide an excellent end-to-end experience from location to menu to service. Their prices are a little bit higher and again, the tip thing is slightly annoying, but given the choice we definitely would return here as often as they're close by! They have a punch card that we'll definitely make use of :)"}
{"text":"I've visited the truck a few times & have found an absolute favorite! -- A waffle with biscoff. I can't get enough. I definitely have a waffle crush!"}
{"text":"I visited the truck for the first time a few weeks ago when they were parked at ALA across from the new Gilbert Temple. My friend and I split the berry waffle and we're glad we did. It was delicious, but SO sweet!! I don't know how people eat these as a meal - they are way more of a dessert. The line was rather short (maybe 9 people ahead of us) but it took at least 45 minutes for us to order and get our waffle.  That alone will prevent me from making this a regular stop.

Was it good? Absolutely. Was it pricey? A little $7. Would I recommend? Absolutely - you must try at least one!"}
{"text":"I have been craving waffles for months now. When I yelped waffles and came across a waffle food truck, I thought my dreams have come true and all was perfect in the world. 

I came on a Saturday evening. I think I overheard that one of their burners was out, and for that the wait was kinda long. But that's totally understandable. No issues there. 

I ordered the liege waffle with strawberries and cream. Oh the cream! It was delicious. And the strawberries seemed fresh. But the waffle. It was soooooooo doughy and really yeasty. It wasn't even really crunchy. The inside was just completely raw thick dough. I could barely eat it. But because I wanted to like it so much, I did eat it. 

I wouldn't go out of my way for this food truck again. 3 stars for the cream and strawberries."}
{"text":"Usually like these trucks, especially the waffle trucks. Last night I hit the trifecta as I ordered three to go. Got home and found three perfectly burned waffles. Yup...burned.  It was disappointing and a great waste of money. I'll look for \"love\" next time ."}
{"text":"Slow, pricey, not a great waffle, we didn't end up eating it.  The fresh whipped cream was good though.  Went to grab a quick bite for my daughter and I at the Gilbert Farmers Market this morning.   Waited and waited, went and bought veggies, came back, waited, waited.  I am a patient person but man that was a crazy long wait for a waffle.  That's all they make!  They should have it down by now!  Lol!"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life, Waffle Crush?! I finally tracked them down & ordered myself the Mellow (nutella filled waffle topped with biscoff, toasted marshmallows & homemade whipped cream on the side).  This was so phenomenal! I'm almost glad they don't come to the WV often because it would be harmful to my waist & my wallet.   I saved some for the next day & it was just as amazing. Sigh, I'm dreaming of you now, Mellow!"}
{"text":"We tried Waffle Crush for the first time at the Ahwatukee Eats Food Truck Picnic. My husband and I both agreed they had the fastest, friendliest service of any truck. My husband even remarked that he wished they had savory waffles so that we could've gotten our dinner from them, as well. We can't wait to try more waffles!"}
{"text":"LOVE this food truck! My first experience with Waffle Crush was at the grand opening of the #queencreekfeastival and they did not disappoint. The waffle was moist and fluffy. I am a fan and will eat waffles from Waffle Crush anytime!"}
{"text":"Amazing Waffles! Follow them on Instagram and Twitter to find out where they are at. Totally worth ANY drive!"}
{"text":"I had the cinna-sugar waffle at the Waffle Crush food truck at Ballet Under the Stars in Tempe Beach Park. 

There wasn't anything particularly special about it, it just tasted like a churro with vanilla ice cream. This was just an \"okay\" experience, nothing to write home about, but not bad."}
{"text":"I really, REALLY wanted to like this and I did...sort of.  I guess it is fair to say that maybe I just don't love Leige waffles.  They are very sweet and I think I prefer the belgian sort.  That being said, I did like it but it is very dense and filling.  I ordered a strawberry and creme waffle.  We ordered right away with little to no line to order but it took a good 20 minutes to get our waffles.  There is no seating whatsoever as the truck moves from location to location.  We stood while waiting as well as eating.  The truck seems very clean and that is something I look for in food trucks.   I'd like to try a couple different varieties and definitely will share next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious dessert waffles.  Several toppings to choose from: fruits, creme, ice cream, biscoff, nutella, etc.  I prefer the strawberry or peaches ones.  Be sure to follow them on Facebook or their other social media for their location schedule."}
{"text":"I stalk this truck almost every weekend.  The waffles are amazing. The homemade whipped cream is to die for.  I've tried every waffle the offer and they're all amazing.  Check them out on Facebook to find them.  The staff is all great as well!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. You will never eat another waffle compared to this.

We visited the truck at the Gilbert Farmers Market. Our order was ready in about 10 minutes. I opted for The Berry waffle. One delicious waffle, moist on the inside, crispy sugar goodness on the outside, topped with Biscoff, strawberries, and one large scoop of  whipped cream goodness.

I will never have another waffle quite like this. Make sure you have a water or black coffee near by to balance out the sweetness!"}
{"text":"Best waffle of my entire life. They are definitely a food truck worth following. The end. Go get one!"}
{"text":"Your entire crew TOTALLY ROCKED at our son's wedding reception on Saturday!! Delicious food and excellent service!! Absolutely the best decision to hire Waffle Crush! \"Thank You\" doesn't begin to cover it!  Best Reception Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Unlike it's line, I'm going to keep this short.  Tasty but small, expensive and slow.  Maybe worth going back every now-n-then for a date night dessert but no more frequent than that."}
{"text":"Best. Waffles. Ever. My company had these guys cater breakfast for us and I fell in love. Sought them out again at the Gilbert Farmer's Market with my youngest daughter and was not disappointed. I always have the Nana and it's just about my favorite breakfast ever. Super filling. First one I had took me over an hour to eat. If you see this big, pink truck, grab a waffle. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The waffle crush made an appearance at a super bowl party I was at this Sunday and it was AMAZING! Such a treat. The strawberries were so fresh on my waffle! If anyone wants to impress their friends at a party, this truck is one way to do it!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Waffle Crush recently at an event. My sister has been waiting patiently to find an event nearby by following WC through Instagram...plus she might have a slight waffle obsession. The line moved quickly and the menu of options ranges from pre-made creations to a \"build your own\" concept. The \"Nana\" with it's banana and nutella goodness looked too good to pass up so we ordered that and a can of soda, which was a total of $8. After a 10 minute wait, the waffle came out. Between the 2 of us, we didn't finish the plate because it was so rich and the waffle was very dense. I can't say I didn't like it but I won't be spending $7 any time soon to get another one. Oh well."}
{"text":"Best waffle ever. I have tried the other guys before such as waffle love and the Swedish one. Not even on the same level. I like the Mello waffle the best. Great balance of sweet and the biscoff seals the deal. Give them a shot."}
{"text":"So we had a work event for National Waffle Day! This food truck provided us with waffles of all kinds! I don't know the name of the one I had, but this waffle had nutella, strawberries and a homemade whip cream. The flavors was just right,  no too sweet and fresh flavors! With that this #NationalWaffleDay could not have been any better in the workplace!"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review for a food truck. I think it's kinda cool since food trucks are mobile I would think they would not be able to be listed for writing reviews- yet here they are on Yelp!

Can I just say, \"Yum!\"  Let me first declare that I generally don't have a sweet tooth but this delectable concoctions just looked too mouth watering to pass up!

I was at the Unexpected Art Gallery grand opening downtown when I noticed several of the fellow festival goers had these mounds of ice cream on top of a waffle and it just looked yummy!

After seeing waffle creation after waffle creation I couldn't resist anymore and I bought one that was waffle smeared with Nutella with about a pint of vanilla ice cream on top with a piece of chocolate & the girl was nice enough to also give me 2 scoops of freshly made whipped cream. 

I prob could have eaten this whole creation myself- I shared with 2 other friends and it was still plenty for us. 

And I can write that I didn't indulge- sort of."}
{"text":"I tried Waffle Crush with my Husband at their new location in Gilbert. It was delicious!! The texture of the waffles was perfect. Golden, but not dry. We had pumpkin and lemon raspberry. Not too sweet--just right. Love the decor in the cafe too!"}
{"text":"I have a very recent frame of reference to analyze the flavor of Belgian waffles because we ate waffles in Belgium only a few months ago.  With the first bite of my Waffle Crush waffle, I was transported back to the streets of Brugge.  I ordered the waffle with speculos spread, strawberries and their luscious whipped cream.  I could eat that cream on everything!  The waffle had a crisp texture on the outside, but was perfectly soft and sugary on the inside.  I'm gonna start stalking this truck!!  Everything runs about $7-7.50 and you can creat your own waffle starting at $4."}
{"text":"Had my first Waffle crush experience a few days ago when they came to a work event. It was amazing! Beyond words amazing! I ordered The Berry, fresh waffle w/ biscoff spread, fresh strawberries and their homemade cream! I definitely wish they came to the Glendale/ West Phoenix side of town more often!"}
{"text":"I definitely have a crush on Waffle Crush. This truck is not serving up your average waffle with maple syrup. They are thick, similar to a Belgian waffle and they'll load your waffle with chocolate, ice cream, whipped cream, fruit, Nutella - whatever you like. They also have this topping called Biscoff that is awesome. It's kinda like Nutella but better. It's made from cookies and has a bit of a peanut butter-like taste. Try it, you'll like it.

I got a Biscoff and banana waffle with whipped cream. When they brought it out I thought they messed up and gave me ice cream instead. No joke! I've never had whipped cream like this - it was so thick! And delicious, duh. It's very rich and filling. This is not an every day waffle unless you have an iron stomach and run marathons. But as a treat, it's indulgently awesome.

This truck is a great addition to the growing food truck community. Get out there and support good food, people!"}
{"text":"Yum. The waffles here are way over the top, decadent, rich, filling and yummy. This isn't a waffle I can eat everyday but definitely a place for a treat. The shop is sooooo cute. I love how it's decorated. Super cute. Only downside is sometimes it gets busy and you have to wait."}
{"text":"I had my first waffle crush today! It was delicious. I went with the berry which is a waffle with strawberries and cream w/ biscoff which was SO good. Kids got raspberry with ice cream and a make it yourself with chocolate, strawberries, and ice cream. 

The ladies in the truck were super nice, and it only took a few minutes to get our waffles. Good thing too because a line was starting to form :)

The 4 star review is because of price. I thought $7.50 was a little steep... Everything else was a 5 star treat."}
{"text":"There waffles are ok very sweet I think it's just very over priced 3 waffles and 3 bottle waters cost me 40$"}
{"text":"Waffle Crush is one of my very favorite food trucks in the Valley.  Real Liege waffles are not so easy to come by and these are done right! My faves are the \"Nana\" with Nutella and bananas & the \"Berry\" with Biscoff spread and fresh strawberries.   Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Was expecting Waffle Crush at Poston Jr. High on Thursday evening!  You never showed up."}
{"text":"My son wanted to try this today as a birthday treat. Delicious !  We got the berry waffles and wow--tastebud explosion!  $7.50 was a bit pricey, so next time I will sneak out without all four kiddos!"}
{"text":"Oh my gracious-where to start! Let's start with the food..good good stuff! They have a nice variety of options to top your waffle and the waffle itself is delish. The people that I've encountered working this food truck are friendly, personable, and patient as you sit and contemplate all of your options. They are also efficient as I've never had an exorbitant wait for my delicious treat. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for a waffle with fruit. 2 waffles was $16. With out a drink... I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Great option for a yummy treat. Nice people who are local and support other local small biz. And yes the waffles are amazing. We love the Nana. Nutella bananas and cream. Line can get long as they can only fit so many workers in there but it's worth the wait. Follow on Instagram to keep tabs on locations. They move around."}
{"text":"If you go now, you can get the pumpkin cheese cake waffle!!!
These are the bomb!  Cheese cake and waffles in the morning is a delight! This truck has a lot to offer as far as delectable treats go.  Cinnamon, sugar, handmade whip cream and everything nice!  They are also super fast!  Check the schedule and see where you can catch them next! :)"}
{"text":"I've only been the to Farmer's Market food truck, but every time I'm there, you'll find me with a waffle. I hate that you pay $7 for one, but after eating it, you're so full and it was so delicious, that you don't even mind it. I've heard the hype, but never tried it until this year. This made me fall in love with waffles all over again. I went somewhere else after this visit, and nothing can amount to Waffle Crush! Great flavors, not too sweet, not too plain. Workers are always friendly."}
{"text":"The waffles from mywafflecrush are very comparable to waffleluv, which to my surprise was not quite as delectable. The waffles didn't have quite the pearl sugar crunch and sweetness that a Liege waffle should; It had a yeasty taste to it. My mindset is if I'm going to pay $8 on a waffle, it better taste authentic. I'm a poor college gal. Still, the berry waffle satiated my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Waffle crush is a yummy treat!  They sure know that waffles are going to be winners if you put them together with Nutella or biscoff!

My favorites are the mellow, berry, and nana. Wait. That's almost all of them. Haha. The ladies/owners are awesome.

My only gripe is that they are often in Chandler/Gilbert/Mesa and wish they were closer to Tempe/Phoenix. But I guess it's good for my wallet that they aren't always so close by."}
{"text":"As a power ranch resident I go to the farmers market every Wednesday with my son and get a nana waffle from you guys. This evening I was thrilled that I finally get my \"free\" 10th waffle. When come to find out that it's not actually free, more like 1/2 off because I still owed money. Just want to let you know that it's false advertisement to offer something for free when it's actually not. I spend $7+ dollars on a waffle and tip a couple bucks Everytime. My \"FREE\" waffle should be of that same value. You just lost a customer and my word of mouth advertising for your food truck."}
{"text":"Waffles were very delicious and creative! However very over priced for me and girla working the trucks in Gilbert are very snobby and impatient."}
{"text":"Great waffle, friendly people, and prices are a little on the high side for the amount of food you get.  It's a food truck I would try again if I came across it."}
{"text":"Waffle Crush is super great!  They park at a school near my house about once a week and my two year old (who doesn't say many words yet) learned the word \"waffle\" after his first visit.

The waffles are uncomplicated and hot.  Little chunks of sugar are found crystallized throughout the waffle which is amazing and they have so many different combinations to choose from for toppings.

I usually go with the standard banana and Nutella toppings, but they have a Biscoff topping that you have to try before turning your nose up at it.  You probably don't even know what Biscoff is so why not try it?  Biscoff are cookies that are ground up into a spread - it's cookie spread!  It's amazing; try it.

On New Year's Eve, my wife found out that Waffle Crush was open until 1am and we drove 30 minutes out of our way just to stop by and get some waffles.  They are that good.

They do take credit cards which is great; they have an iPad with a card reader so as you order, they will punch your order into the iPad, it gets sent automatically to the chefs in the truck, and they run your card.  It's super easy and convenient.

I would recommend ordering your waffle in a to-go container.  It's a little bit easier to manage and if you don't finish the whole waffle (they're pretty small anyway) you can close it up and take it home with you."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try a waffle from Waffle Crush.  Unfortunately, it was not as great as I anticipated. 

I ordered a plain waffle with blueberries and fresh whipped cream. The cream was excellent and the blueberries were good, but the waffle itself really did nothing for me. It was nice and crispy on the outside, the inside was very dense and thick. It had a faint yeast flavor, but I thought it could have used more salt. It was a letdown. 

They look wonderful, but if you are going to be selling waffles they ought to be amazing on their own. I suspect all the toppings (Nutella, chocolate, Biscoff) just cover up the blandness of the waffle.  

I'll stick to my own waffles I make at home."}
{"text":"I LOVE WAFFLE CRUSH! Whenever they're on the west side of the valley (about once a week, they're mainly in the Gilbert/Chandler area) I always have to grab a gluten free waffle! The employees in the truck are so sweet and fun and always present an Instagram-worthy waffle! The gluten free waffle can be a little dry, but 1.) that's to be expected from a lot gluten free things, so I you can't complain, and 2.) it's nothing a heaping serving of strawberries, a layer of Nutella, and a giant scoop of whipped cream can't fix. Stop by the truck and get yourself a liege waffle!"}
{"text":"My hubby, kiddos, and I frequent the Gilbert Farmer's market almost every Saturday. While we are there, this is the food truck that my kiddos and I go to. The waffles are SO GOOD! Over the past couple years we have tried every menu item that they have had. You can't go wrong with any combination. Our personal favorites are the Nana and the Mellow."}
{"text":"Good dessert to split between two people, but I didn't think it was anything extraordinary.  My wife and I split the Nana, which is a waffle with Nutella, sliced banana, and whipped cream. I don't know anything about liege waffles, but it was very thick and heavy.  You will want to save room if you are going to have one of their waffles for dessert.  They had pretty standard options.  Nothing fancy or unique.  Good, but not great."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing waffle with nutella at the Ahwatukee Eats food truck rally at warner and 48th. I cannot wait to have another at their next event September 26th! YUM!"}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE Liege waffles, so when we heard about Waffle Crush here in the East Valley we were very excited! I heard about them from a friend on Instagram and made a note to go sometime this week.

I came home from work last night and my wife whisked me and my son away and took me to the Waffle Crush location last night. I was excited... the last time I had a Liege waffle was at Waffles and Dinges in NYC last April. Needless to say, I was giddy. I asked my wife what my spending limit was and I was given an unlimited budget! \"Oh the possibilities!\" I thought to myself. Speculoos (or as they had it listed, Biscoff), Nutella, cream, ice cream, chocolate, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows... I was in heaven... then I saw the prices. Oh well, I wasn't paying. I ordered the \"Scoop\" because I wanted ice cream an felt like a glutton. The waffle came out hot with a heaping pile of ice cream. Wonderful! Upon further inspection the Nutella was just a thin layer, no big deal. I was really excited for a good piece of chocolate on top as was described on the ingredients board... I bit in to it and it was just Hershey's chocolate. I looked at my wife and said, \"You've GOT to be kidding me.\" As someone who just bought a semi-authentic Belgian waffle the last thing I'd expect to taste or find on my waffle was waxy, disgusting Hershey's chocolate, especially for a price tag of $7.50. What are Belgians known for people? Their waffles and their chocolate. 

Unfortunately, I was completely let down. The waffle itself was good, but not $4 good. The quality of toppings definitely needs to be improved, I really want to see Waffle Crush succeed in this food truck saturated valley. If Waffles and Dinges can succeed and keep their prices low in NYC I know Waffle Crush can do it here."}
{"text":"There was a lot of build up about Waffle Crush, so maybe that tainted my expectations.  For that, I will give them 3 stars instead of 2.  

I ordered a waffle with bananas, biscoff and cream cheese frosting.  The wait was not long (less than 15 minutes) and a very well-presented waffle emerged from the window, still quite warm.

I was hoping I'd love these liege waffles everyone is raving about.  To me, the waffle  tasted highly of yeast (not a flavor I am a big fan of) and was just not tasty.  The toppings were excellent, but I would have rather had a regular waffle, truth be told.  The outside was crisp, but the inside was too doughy for me.  

I am a fan of trying \"different\" and \"new\" flavors.  This just was not one of them.  I am not one to jump on the \"it's so great\" bandwagon easily, but when I do try something new that I like, I sing its praises.  I just wasn't impressed.  

Will I go out of my way again to try Waffle Crush?  No.  Will I order one again if the truck is nearby?  Maybe.  Only time will tell.  Next time, I will try their special of the day.  Perhaps I will like it better!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. what else can I say? Add them on Instagram and just TRY to keep away from the truck. I love waffles, I love this truck. Prepare for a food coma...or maybe share a waffle!"}
