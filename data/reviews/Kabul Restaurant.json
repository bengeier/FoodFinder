{"text":"Friendly service, excellent Afghani and Turkish cuisine.  I had the the lamb kebabs, and the meat was cooked to perfection.  Often times lamb is overcooked and becomes tough, but this lamb was had the perfect ratio of tenderness to firmness.  I also had the Afghan Iced tea, which was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Best kabob's in Madison. The service is also great. I have been here with different crowd sizes and have always left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"It wa nice place to eat your dinner. but it was so crowded!
kabobs were so good ."}
{"text":"Amazing! Khabobs, Hummus, afgan bread, and salad was delightful!

It was a busy Friday night but the staff was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable about the cuisine. Everyone was more than happy with their meals. Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy ethnic food in general, and recently had a dinner at Kabul that we both thought was an exceptional value. Meals include bread with one or two tasty chutneys and soup or salad, both of which tasted good,. Entrees of salmon in a cream sauce with rice, and a lemon chicken dish also with rice, were both thoroughly enjoyed. The best part was that our meals, which included a bottle of wine, came in at under $60! The service can be a little uneven, and some of the wait staff are not the most professional, but the food and the cost more than make up for that. Finally, the place is hard to find just a doorway and you walk up a flight of stairs. Initially not very inviting but once you get to the dining room it's just fine."}
{"text":"Their curried vegetables are pretty bland.  I would definitely recommend Husnu's (right next door) over Kabul for any vegans.  The vegan food is tastier there, and you can always eat the soup or salad that comes with your meal. The salad dressing at Kabul has eggs in it, and when I went, they didn't have a vegan soup.  The service at Kabul was good, though."}
{"text":"Very delicious seafood salad and (usually) tasty raspberry stuffed chicken (get it as a lunch special, otherwise a bit overpriced, and can be a bit dry.) 

The hummus is middling/inconsistent and I'm not sure how I feel about the ubiquitous cucumber curry salad dressing, but I go there pretty frequently because it's a good place to have wine with your lunch and I am all about being as French as possible."}
{"text":"We had the most frustrating experience at Kabul. The waitress came after 10 minutes to take our order, and when we placed our order, she told us that they had run out of the couscous, ashak, falusiya and the beef korma (we were a group of 4, three of whom were vegetarians). Why didn't she tell this earlier the moment we entered?

We requested more time to decide alternate dishes. She came back after 10 minutes, and this time when we asked for Badin jan Chalow, she said they did not carry that either. This was ridiculous. We were now left with no options. We ordered the only remaining 3 items in the menu, which honestly weren't that great.

We also had to call the waitress each time we wanted water."}
{"text":"It's true that Kabul isn't really memorable. But its kabobs are good. It feels like a restaurant on a college campus should ... like it's just managing to get by. It's good food."}
{"text":"My last, and I mean LAST experience at Kabul's was beyond bad.  The food was disgusting and the service was even worse, and now I'm left with needing to get my coat dry cleaned to get rid of the smell of the place.  It left a bad taste in my mouth as well - - - - -"}
{"text":"The food is lacking flavor. The Nile and Middle Eastern Cafe are the best in Madison for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Our first choice for having lunch was closed, so we reluctantly entered Kabul.  As it turned out, this warm restaurant was a great place for a hearty meal and quiet conversation on a cold November afternoon.  

The hummus we shared as an appetizer was decent, but a little watery.  The ambiance and deliciously tender lamb curry left an overall positive impression, though.  Total cost for three orders plus the hummus was $42."}
{"text":"Kabul has been one of my favorite restaurants on State, especially for lunch, since they offer lunch specials at really great prices. Their food is that good that we have been there multiple occasions for dinner too. So I was sad when they had to close down for constructions. But recently I found out it reopened! They are now on the second floor of state, joining sunroom as one of the nice dining places with window seats overlooking State St. 

One of the things I like about Kabul is their sauces that go with the home made break. The green cilantro based sauce is the best, just a tinge spicy but really fragrant. Unfortunately their sauces are no longer the help yourself type. Instead you are served a tiny portion of the dipping sauces, hardly enough for the bread. I think you can probably ask for more (I haven't tried that yet though), but it's more trouble than before. i wished i had a picture, but we went at night and it was pretty dark in there. one day when we go  for lunch I'll try again. I'm also not sure if they changed the way bread is served or they were just very busy that night, but our bread came cold, like, stone cold, not just room temperature cold, which was a little weird. 

Service was pretty slow. There were only 2-3 wait staff and the restaurant was pretty packed on a week day night. We felt that we had covered every topic you can think of but our food still wasn't here. Plus they got my order wrong, I substituted the rice in my curry with couscous, but it came with both rice and couscous because they forgot about that. The waitress did come over to apologize before I'd said anything, so I'm not complaining. In the end I gave the rice to my bf, who was happy that he got double rice while i enjoyed my couscous lamb curry. 

I am hoping this huge crowd and slow service are just related to their pretty recent re-opening. So I will go back to try again in a little bit. And hope that those old days and memories of the great place and great food will return *wistful look*"}
{"text":"Everything was so good! The soup that comes as a side dish was really flavorful, with lentils and other grains and things at the bottom. I had the special: the duck strudel with puff pastry, wild rice, and shitaki mushrooms. Yes, it was as good as it sounds. 

Everything around the table was quality as well as quantity. We got the stuffed artichokes and the dumplings as an appetizer, and those were small, but good. The entrees packed the punch, they all came with bread and soup or salad!

This was my first experience with Afghan food, and I'd be nervous to try it again at another place, because it might not be as good!"}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous. We waited over 20 min for anyone to serve us water and no one came to our table. Finally we just left. Their decoration was also unsafe. They have this steel decoration on the wall that moved when my kid touched it. It was very heavy. If it fell, my kid could die. Totally unsafe."}
{"text":"Went with my teacher/friend.  Food was great, atmosphere romantic.  They played Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On during closing time.  Not sure if they thought we were a couple despite the 40 year age gap, but it was fun."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Kabul, it is probably my favorite restaurant in Madison...

I'll start by mentioning that our enthusiastic and engaging server was a blast to have taking care of my friend and I after a day of shopping and walking around downtown.

As a vegan, there are so many choices! 

I have tried several entrees; the Vegetarian Couscous, Tunisian Spinach Stew and Badin jan Chalow (sans the yoghurt sauce); all are impressive- and hearty portions to boot! On the appetizer side, I've sampled hummus, burani, baba ghanoush and tabbouleh (the appetizer sampler includes all four), and they are spectacular. (The complimentary bread is also served with a cilantro-y chutney which is hard to get enough of!)

The cucumber basil martini is on-point, and I had a sip of my friend's pomegranate martini and realized you probably can't go wrong ordering any cocktail on the menu... They all appear to pair perfectly and add some refreshing balance to the Mediterranean noshing that will ensue as soon as you sit down and soak up the beautiful surroundings.

Tapestries, fresh plants, and a clean white-walled environment welcome you, and the second-floor view of state street below makes for wonderful people-watching.

Afghani food... you're probably unsure what that all entails (as was I before my first venture inside), but the menu is heavy with enticing choices and all are fragrant and perfectly spiced. I dare you to come try and not leave content and full. 

I can't wait to go back for more spectacular food, cocktails and service.

Cheers!

Victoria"}
{"text":"I ordered the ginger chicken thinking that it would warm me up on a cold day. What I got was a tomato dish with a mushy side. It seemed like the food had been reheated several times. The menu looks great but the waitstaff had a hard time relaying the dishes ingredients and since I'm on a different diet than most this was a bit annoying. To be fair, the waitress was friendly, but the service was slow. I wanted more water and had asked for more towards the end of my dish but never got it. I deducted this from my tip. 

I hesitate to go back"}
{"text":"Kabul is one of my favorite spots in Madison for either lunch or dinner! The atmosphere of the new location is casual and comfortable and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The lamb dishes and the specials are always my favorite though! I've even met the owner (who is also the chef) and he truly cares about each customer's experience at Kabul. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour for food to arrive. We kept being told it would come soon, but it did not. The meat was undercooked even though I specifically asked the waiter for it to be well cooked. The rice was a bit inedible as there were many hard pieces and it was cheap rice. While, the soup and tabouleh were very good, I would not return due to the immature antics of the wait staff, extremely long wait for food, and undercooked meat."}
{"text":"The best chicken I've had in a long time! As well as the best salmon! I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant in hopes of getting some good authentic Afghan food. My boyfriend is from Afghanistan and I've tasted authentic food before. To call this Afghan food would be a complete insult. This food was completely bland and tasteless. Afghan food is known for its deep complex flavors and this restaurant did not deliver. I was very disappointed when I received my chicken Kabobs and noticed that the color was all wrong. Proper Afghan chicken kabob should be marinated over night in yogurt and spices. This should leave a strong color stain on the meat. Instead of receiving chicken that was nicely colored my chicken had a pale orange tint and barely any flavor. If you're looking for real Afghan or flavorful food, this is not the place to go. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good service. The food was tasty except for the vegetarian couscous which had bland sauce and was watery.  The soup was excellent as was the bread and dipping sauces."}
{"text":"The city of Kabul is pretty far away, so I try to stop by this restaurant whenever I'm in Madison.  The dishes are very good and ultra reasonably priced.  I love the lamb."}
{"text":"Excellent lamb kabob, but service was very slow for lunch. Plan on being here at least an hour. I also recommend the Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"As an out of towner - this was a great find.  Yummy and in a cold evening, a delicious warm meal.  If you like adventurous dining, this is your spot."}
{"text":"WHAT A JOKE this restaurant is.  No entree that a group of 4 ordered turned out to be authentic or even taste good.   I know Afghan food very well, cause i've grown up with it.

I was totally embarrased, and even tried to speak to the owner to give my piece of mind.  This person is a disgrace to the culture, and to himself for shortchanging you as a customer of your right to have authentic Afghan food which is very delicious.  The Afghan culture prides itself on great food, and is well known throughout the world.  

This establishment is horrible, and I even thought about picketting or opening up another restaurant to compete just to prove it's shittiness."}
{"text":"buuuuuummmmmer......
Was in Madison this past weekend for football weekend. After an awesome win, proudly took some friends through campus. Was THRILLED to see 1 of my old favorites still around. I extolled the virtues of this historically awesome restaurant. Boy did I have egg on my face by the end of the night. Food is not nearly as good, not particularly flavorful & the smells no longer waft (should've been my first clue). The young man who waited on us was initially fairly pleasant, despite our sense that he may have been in over his head. After nearly 2 hours of seeing others who came in after us get served & twice asking to speak to a manager (& our requests being ignored), our dinner arrived. It wasn't terrible, but it was far from amazing & by that point, we were so disgusted....When we again asked for a manager, we were told there wasn't one on duty and the person who was sortof in charge didn't speak english. Incredulous on numerous levels?? So many ways to be disgusted by that response. We didn't complain or ask for a manager to get a reduction of our bill, yet the waiter volunteered why he couldn't do anything at all for us. What a bummer. The Kabul of yesteryear is gone!"}
{"text":"The flat bread is fantastic and so is the hummus. Had the chicken curry with couscous. Not impressed by the curry but the chicken was fall-off-the bone. Staff not exceptional but it was the tail end of a busy friday night so I can understand."}
{"text":"Portion is huge,quite pricey.  This place is just okay for me,would not go back."}
{"text":"Do not listen to obviously fake posts. Climb up the pitch dark stairs - decor doesn't look so bad. But the food was awful, few bits of lamb were gristle, chicken was not fresh - nothing was fresh. Mostly starch/potatoes for a $15 dish. Piles of rice, potatoes and couscous that would have been better on their own instead of dabbled with bad sauces and bad meat. We've eaten middle eastern food all over the states (and all over the world) - this was the worst. 2 of us had stomach problems soon after and we didn't even finish one of the dishes. Stay away."}
{"text":"I miss going to this place now that I've graduated and moved away.  I used to go for their lunch specials because you'd still get the great food but for cheaper (though the portions were also smaller I believe).  The duck strudel is just delicious!!!  The Mashawa (soup) is so unique and memorable that I am attempting to make my own since I found a recipe online.  There was also some stuffed chicken entree that I used to get as well.  I'm sure many other dishes are great but I had a hard time not getting the duck strudel every single time I went!  I am not an expert in this type of cuisine, but even if it's not the best afgan/mediterranean food you've ever had, you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I try to go here every time I visit my alma mater.

I've lived all over (San Francisco, San Diego, Indiana, and Mongolia to name a few) but nothing beats the salad dressing and flavorful vegetarian dishes offered at Kabul.  I can't even name a favorite dish, everything is so good!

One of the best things about Kabul is the free chutneys and bread, which is always fantastic.  Some spicy, some not (so everyone can enjoy) plus yogurt for my friends who don't like spicy food.  Even my pickiest friends always found something they enjoyed on the menu.

Wow, just got incredibly hungry and must make a trip back to Madison ASAP!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try any of their meat dishes--and perhaps this makes me unable to rate the restaurant adequately--but the vegetarian dishes we had here were either bland or terrible. I have a few Afghan friends and have been to several really good Afghan restaurants in the Bay Area and NYC so I know delicious, creative vegetarian Afghan food is possible. Missing here was anything resembling the FRESH creamy, minty, pumpkin and eggplant dishes and fruity and spicy rice dishes I've known....Instead we got heavy, poorly flavored, canned tomato sauce concoctions ladled over what seemed to be food made out of canned spinach and canned green beans. I may be a vegetarian but that doesn't mean we don't have taste buds just like everybody else. 

What is up with all the terrible ethnic food on State street? How are they still in business? They're all either overpriced (see Himal Chuli) or just plain awful. I realize I'm spoiled after living in San Francisco, Portland, and NYC, but come on Midwest - you can do better than this."}
{"text":"Kabul is my favorite restaurant in Madison.  The new space is inviting and modern.  The wait staff and bartenders are always genuinely enthusiastic.   As far as the food goes, you have to try the stuffed chicken and hummus.  So good.  After our meal we step up to the bar to have a few cocktails.   It's a relaxing place to hang out and it usually brings in a fun crowd.  

If you're looking for a great meal and a fun time, Kabul is the place to be."}
{"text":"Kabul uses fresh herbs and well balanced spices to create tasty and healthy dishes. Last evening my husband and I stopped in Kabul on impulse. The new decor is light, but incorporates authentic Afghan items. The staff was genuinely pleased to match the meal with our somewhat unusual preferences. We will bring friends with us next time. For the price, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"First service is bad the server was rude so crowded
Salad is not tasteful food is not authentic afghan if you tasted real afghan food
Price OK but they add 18% gratuity tip but I swallowed b/c my in laws where with me, I don't think I will go again"}
{"text":"I am a newbie to Mediterranean food but this place was AWESOME. I had the stuffed chicken in a raspberry burgundy sauce and rice with a side of hummus. 

Price point was good. Two beers and my meal with tip came to 25$. 

Service was a bit slow but everything else was great."}
{"text":"I went there for Lunch. The portion of it is too small and pricy. the taste is just okay. We cant really read the waiter's writing on the check (only numbers). Really need an improvement"}
{"text":"Sat at their outdoor seating area for dinner - we had to squeeze our way in towards our tiny table.  I felt like we were literally sitting on top of our neighbors - we were that close to each other.  And it was like a balancing act trying to keep everything on our table from falling and crashing to the ground.  Our server was upbeat and friendly, although the service was a little slow.  We had the Bulani - potato and scallion stuffed flat bread which was deep fried - it was very greasy but pretty good.  It went really well with the yogurt mint sauce.  The salad you get with your entree (you get a choice of soup or salad) wasn't too special except for the lite green colored dressing which was sweet and tasty.  I still can't figure out what herbs they used.  We shared the Kabob Combo - chicken and lamb kabobs served with saffron rice and more yogurt mint sauce.  It was ok, nothing special.  I really wanted to try the chicken with the raspberry sauce I've been reading about but I didn't see it on their menu. :(  I think we'll try their sister restaurant Maza across the street next time."}
{"text":"Best food in Madison! Loved it! Order the chicken kabob and the soup is made to perfection"}
{"text":"The food here was great I tried the afghan tea twice and loved it. The place is small but the are moving across the street in a few weeks. I hope much space is there. Ohhhh and the bread is the best. I can't wait to go back. My friends and I really enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Looking for a different place came across with Kabul. Service outstanding, food super, excellent, return next day with entire family, they accommodated us the wife had a plate that according to them was over cooked but we didn't know and manager came to the table with a new plate without us saying a word and they replaced it because it was not to Up their expectations. 100% recommend the place. Thanks Ahmed."}
{"text":"Kabul was delicious. I had the Fasuliya and was pleased as punch with it. Our server was pleasant, even if the host was a bit surly, and everyone left pleased with the meal. 

The only qualm we observed was that the food on the menu wasn't noted as being spicy hot, even though it was. This wasn't a problem for me, but my mother had problems appreciating her dish due to it's spiciness."}
{"text":"I had the lamb and it was great!!! My service was a little slow.  T
his is a perfect place for a first date."}
{"text":"Back to Kabul after many years and in their new location.  It's nice, but spartan, and lacks some of the homey feel of the old place.  The appetizers, soup and bread were all above average with good sauces -- particularly the mint/cilantro sauce.  However, none of the three of us were impressed with the entrees -- they were just ok.  My kabobs lacked flavor, and the lamb was rarely tender and too large -- I'd like to see them up the flavor profile on the entrees."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who is very familiar with Middle Eastern food was less than satisfied with Kabul, saying the food was not the real thing -- I suppose it isn't, but I've tried various dishes there and some of it is pretty interesting and tasty for what it is. I think that some of the dishes have been toned down or Americanized... Some of the items could've been spicier or might've been fusion dishes. However, their curry was pretty decent if I remember right (not quite spicy enough for me though), my guy likes their salmon, and they have reasonably priced lunch deals.

Service, however, isn't great as some other reviewers have mentioned -- It's pretty slow, so make sure you have plenty of time before coming in."}
{"text":"If you know the cuisine from the region, you will know that what this place offers is terrible and not representative of how fantastic it can and should be. I suppose when there's no competition/comparison nearby, it's easy to operate like Kabul does. Anyhow, the meat has been tough and chewy, the rice is the wrong type of rice. It should be long grain basmati, not the short, fat Uncle Ben's type. The flavor, the marinade used imparts an odd flavor, certainly not reflective of any dish I've ever had prepared by native Afghani's. I should probably add that I grew up eating Persian food, and have been to Persian and Afghani restaurants in Chicago, and Kabul just doesn't even come close. Oh, and the prices are unjustifiable... I've had far, far better at much more reasonable prices. Pass on this one... take it from someone who knows what they're talking about..."}
{"text":"Yelp says it's closed but I'm pretty sure I was here the other night... It was delicious! Burani bulani lamb curry and lamb couscous all get thumbs up. Though if I were to give an edge to any dish it would be the lamb curry, get it with the soup and dip that pita in it and that, my friends, is a really really solid 13$ dinner."}
{"text":"Generally a better deal at the lunch hour. The soups and kabobs are well prepared and the price is reasonable. The service has generally been very good. Decor is a bit tired but homey and not distracting. Appetizers are fresh and quite good. 
4.5 stars.
Thankfully not any sort of snob atmosphere, just a good honest business run by people who care about good food quality."}
{"text":"I was disappointed!  The food did not taste fresh; I have a suspicion that the appetizer soup and the chicken sauce came out of a can.  The bread was served with what tasted like out-of-a-can salsa (at a Mediterranean/Afghan restaurant???), and my meal was served with regular white rice rather than Basmati.  

Service was friendly, but the food was unacceptable!  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"The only thing I think is lacking is the ambiance. Because of that I hair sit outside and people watch :) :)"}
{"text":"Let me say this first, the restaurant is near the University, and I don't thinki a lot of the reviews here of the NEW Kabul's are from experienced diners.  I was a Kabul's \"regular\" who loved dining there in former location.  That said, this Kabul's was a horrible experience.  We ordered drinks, and watched the bartender take a straw and sip out of the blender - classy!  The Lemondrops we ordered did not come with the rims sugared but were good.  The hummus was disgusting - I used ot LOVE their hummus.  This had no flavor and was whipped with so much air it didn't resemble the texture of hummus.  The bread was, meh.  Then came the soup.  I don't know if they were running low or what, but it was so watery our entire table returned it.  my bowl had 8 chickpeas, 2 kidney beans and one piece of undisclosed meat about 1/2\" big.  It tasted like Campbell's canned soup where they added one can too many of water.  BLECH!  We all returned it.  Then came our main courses.  I had the Curry Ginger chicken - a former FAVORITE.  No more!  All one could taste is curry and cumin and it was really hot.  Didn't even resemble to former dish.  My friends got the lamb kabobs and said they were \"warm\" but not hot;  \"goog\" but not great.  The owner was sitting in the diningroom and I think he needed to be supervising the kitchen.  We weren't sure if they were trying to be some \"chic new-age\" MiddleEastern Restaurant and failed, or if it was plain bad food.  The service?  Let's see...the soup was spilled on my coat (with no clean up); they dropped the steak knife on a guest with some food and got the splits wrong for the check.  THe place was so loud you couldn't hear people, and several tables commented on it....we heard them because they were yelling.  I'm sad, because this used to be a wonderful restaurant where the delicate flavors of the Middleeast bleneded wonderfully.  Now?  There are so many in Madison that are better.  Unless you're a college student on a budget....even then you can do better.  Maybe it was a bad night...I dunno.  I might try it again, but it will be awhile before we do.  They need to get their kitchen in shape and staff trained before we do."}
{"text":"The vegetarian dishes that we had were a little short on salt. We sat in the booth close to the kitchen. The ambience was hence not that good. The waiters were friendly though."}
{"text":"Oh, Kabul. I will gladly restore the 5 stars when you bring back the veggie strudel entree and the two sauces you used to offer with your delicious bread. Still a fine place for lunch or dinner and an all-time Madison favorite of the last 2 decades
But that veggie strudel... Mmm, too much of a delight and my tastebuds demand it."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasnt too busy (maybe 7 tables going).

Service was pretty bad.  There were 2 waiters working the ~7 tables and I was pretty turned off by the place.  I never got a refill of water the whole hour 15 minutes we were here.  Also, I had to ask for the Afghan bread which is normally brought out upon arrival.  I felt we were waiting excessively for the salads/soups, the entres, and the checks.

I really enjoyed the soup/salad and the curry chicken when they arrived.  I would give the food a 4 star and the service a 2 star.

Have never been here for dinner, but I am not rushing back to be honest."}
{"text":"Pictures speak a thousand words. I was hesitant about how some of the items would come out after we ordered it but everything was really good. I will try to describe but we had but words will do no justice. We had no complaints from anybody at the table.

The burani was really good and the yogurt on top did a lot to complement the taste of the fried eggplant.

The qabuli was really excellent and probably the best item on the table. I wish I had ordered it so that I could have eaten more of it but I was only able to sample.

The lamb kabobs were perfectly grilled and the lamb didn't have that extra lamb flavor that I don't like. Grilled and still left moist and oh so tender.

The beef korma had a mixture of spices and veggies that was amazing, simply amazing.

The last dish I don't remember what it was called but it was super good too.  Thinking about it makes me hungry. 

This place explains why I'm fat.

The service here was phenomenal. We got there an hour or so before closing time but the server let us sit and relax a bit after the meal and was very polite and quick with the ordering and the serving."}
{"text":"I hate to write a negative review, but it has to be done. Over the weekend we were in Madison and decided to try Kabul Restaurant.  I am I big lover of Afganian food and I was very happy to see that Madison had an Afgan restaurant.  It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed by food.  Everything was very plain, didn't taste like Afgan food at all........Lamb tasted horrible, I don't think it was marinated prior to grilling.  Rice tasted just like something you get at Old Country Buffet.............
The only thing they have going to them is an out door seating and the service was pretty good. If you want to try an Afganian food, this is not the place........."}
{"text":"It's not everyday that one has the opportunity to eat Afghani food and have work pay for it. How could I not try this place out? 

So, I would trust your server if you have no clue as to what to order. If you've had Mediterranean or other middle eastern food, you'll probably be familiar with some of the options. 

I really stuffed myself and hobbled out of here with a full stomach and a smile on my face. I would definitely return and will try to bring my friends or coworkers next time."}
{"text":"Pathetic..horrible service..no idea about foood..took so much time that almost lost apetitte!!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply delicious.  For lunch, they have this lamb dish with tomato, pepper, and onion with two poached eggs.  yum!   (though, you might ask them to take special care to make sure your eggs aren't overdone.)  For dinner, try Ginger Chicken (a curry).  More yum!"}
{"text":"While the service here was really nice, the food and flavor fell a bit flat.  My dinner date and I had the hummus, which was rather bland. We also had the Tunisian Stew and Kabobs neither of which were memorable.I was forced to put a large amount of spicy sauce in my dish to get some flavor. The food, admittedly, was not bad just lacked a certain spunk. There are probably a lot of other great places with the same type of food in Madison."}
{"text":"My first time at Kabul was pretty great. I love the cozy atmosphere above state street. If you're a Madison Native or a college student, you're aware of how crazy the street can get. It was nice to feel a little excluded from it. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I couldn't have asked for better service. We started out with the Baba ganoush and it was SOOOO delicious. I couldn't stop eating it. With our entrees, we had a choice of soup or salad and I chose the salad for something light so I could eat my entree without filling up too much on starters. The salad was alright but my boyfriend ordered the soup and my goodness, I've never tasted a soup so hearty and flavorful. GET THE SOUP, you won't be disappointed. I had the Chafik's Moroccan Lemon Chicken and it was pretty good, but I didn't have too much chicken on my plate as big as the portion was. Most of the plate was just rice, and the actual chicken entree, had big pieces of potato and very small amounts of chicken. I don't think I'd order that again but I am eager to explore the rest of the menu. Definitely check this place out if you're on State."}
{"text":"More than one Vegetarian item on the  menu!  Yeah for choices!   Stopping by for lunch on our way back to Chicago, we ate on the State St. patio of Kabul restaurant.  There was a wait and unfortunately they wouldn't let us put our name on a list and walk around, so we waited.  It didn't take too long - so it was worth it!

I had the Vegetarian cous cous, which was nicely seasoned, a generous portion for the price ($7) and included a soup or salad.  We also shared a plate of the hummous appetizer - also good.  The soup offered is not a vegetarian soup though, it has chicken - be warned!  It'd be nice if there was a vegetarian based soup available to accompany the veggie entrees.  

Our server was attentive (actually, I think we had several servers, they all kept coming by and re-filling our waters, bringing more bread, etc.).  The owner/manager was also accommodating, adjusting the umbrellas to protect everyone from the sun.

BOTTOM LINE:  A good experience, lots of choices, generous portions and good prices.  I'd be happy to go back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get Afghani food. 
Enjoyed the curry chicken but service and food quality varies depending on the day you come. 

The ambiance is nice for an evening out but the place could use a little more light!"}
{"text":"Apparently my mother has never eaten Afghani/Mediterranean food. Weird, huh? So I took her to Kabul. 

I was surprised after looking at the menu to find that the appetizers cost the same price as the entrees. My first thought was: Better be large apps! My second thought was: It's unfortunate that Kabul doesn't cater to the surrounding college students by providing at least a few cheap options on the menu.  

I got my mother the hummus app plate and I had a bowl of their lentil soup. The hummus plate WAS huge. The two of us weren't even able to finish it. It was tasty and now my mom knows she likes hummus. Cool! 

My lentil soup was pretty good, but I had to get out of my seat to ask the waitress to get me lime wedges. Then she brought thin slices of lime as you would put in your drink. I could even squeeze any juice into my soup and now it was coldish. Boo.

A-OK"}
{"text":"Afghan food sounds like checking out. 3.5 stars for this place. First off this is located in a trendy college area and I would call it the hip strip. Out door seating is in front because the place is small. The place was dumpy but the smell was wonderful and the service was slow. The starter soup was awesome before  the lamb kabobs came. The kabobs were good but a little over cooked for me and the tangy yogurt was great with the lamb. This is worth checking out at least once. My friends liked what they had but I can't comment on that. The place filled up fast between 6:30 and 7:30 so people must like it. Just below is a south African joint that might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"This middle eastern/mediterranean restaurant and Husnu's are really twins, located adjacent to each other on State Street.  I recall them as having both been fairly mediocre and unmemorable restaurants.  Maybe they both survive because people get a kick out of how extraordinarily similar and mediocre they are."}
{"text":"Good tasting food with great taste, it was my first time eating Afghanistan style food and i dont regret it. I will definitely try it again but I would not get the soup to starter because it made my stomach was acting funny after i ate it. I had the stuffed chicken which was brutally good and my friend had the beed stew which was good as well."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the food, neither can i remember much about it but sipping on the soup and suddenly this rock piece in my mouth... BLEH!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in from out of state and showed up after they closed but Hamed the owner insisted we sit. He wouldn't let us leave without staying and eating. Was very personable and great to chat with while we were ordering food. He recommended a lamb dish and chicken dish and even included a free soup. Every single dish blew my mind. The waitress, Sophia, was also great and quick with everything. Highly recommended and definitely coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friend! Tasty and plenty! I ordered lamb kabob and my friend ordered curry lamb $31.86 in total. it is at the second floor and looks like a bar when going up. It does have bar though. They make great barbecue!"}
{"text":"Fun, well priced, and tasty. Solid eastern fare."}
{"text":"This place is a great restaurant.  It's not as good as Husnu's, next door, but it's still great.  The two restaurants actually have different menus.  Which works well, since there's also an Ethiopian restaurant between them and another Middle Eastern restaurant across the street.
  
I personally like the Lamb Curry, Kaftachalow and Moroccan Lemon Chicken.  The meat is great.  It's top quality, no gristle and very tender.  The sauces aren't over powering and are flavored just right to make the meat just amazing.

The vegetarian options are just as good.  The chef's here have a gift.  They work art with food.  The dishes look amazing and work on every level.

The service here is also very good.  So, good, infact that I once forgot to leave a tip for the waitress and promptly made a 20 minute walk in a blizzard to give a tip to our waitress.

I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I've had the eggplant and the meatballs, and both were really good. Lunch service is incredibly slow, though, with no apologies."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Glad that it reopened. Lamb kabob"}
{"text":"Since they moved they seem to have become a more general middle eastern restaurant. It's not authentic Afghan cuisine but it is delicious. We had great service as well. Definitely better than the old location."}
{"text":"We ate at Kabul for lunch last Saturday. This was the first time we'd been there since it moved across the street and upstairs. We had a great experience.

The atmosphere was clean, simple, light, comfortable. We were greeted as we entered the restaurant by our waiter/the bartender who told us to take a seat. We picked a table by a window overlooking State Street. Our waiter brought us menus, water, and bread with a fantastic cilantro chutney. He told us if we wanted more to just let him know. The bread was fresh, chewy, perfect texture and the chutney was amazing. Slightly spicy, tons of flavor, very fresh.

For lunch we ordered the koftachalow and the lamb curry. The koftachalow is meatballs with a sauce of onions, tomatoes, yellow split-peas & fresh herbs. Completely delicious! It was served with white rice, but unlike the rice served in most Chinese or Indian restaurants this rice did not stick and almost tasted like each grain was coated in butter. Beautiful and yummy! The lamb was served with mushrooms, potatoes & spinach in a light tomato curry sauce. It was also outstanding.

We thought the service was excellent, the food incredible and the value very reasonable. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh so good.  Get their spinach vegan dish.  The spices are all there and it tastes heavenly.  And the bread and chutneys that come with the dishes are just great.  It's a bit pricey for what I would consider something I that I can easily eat in one sitting, but very very good."}
{"text":"My favorite is their salad with the curry cucumber dressing (YUM!).  Also a fan of their chicken pita sandwich (at lunch) and their kabobs.  The flatbread is great, too.  The service is not the best, but I'll overlook it because I always have such a great, relaxing time when I'm there."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is awful. The location is great, right off State Street. My friend and I decided to sit outside. I went in to get a waitress, since nobody was near sight, and we were sitting there for a little while already. Finally someone came down and took our order. Our drinks came right the way, but our food took nearly 30 minutes to arrive....that's ridiculous for a plate of humus. The people behind us ordered the same exact thing, and even though they arrived wayyyyyyy after us, they still got their food before us. I asked the server what was going on and she replied, \"I am not your server\" and walked away. Finally our food came, then the next round of drinks took forever. Finally when she brought the drinks we asked for our check right the way...another 15 minutes went by...

This place needs MAJOR costumer service improvement!!! It is absolutely awful currently!!! I do NOT recommend this place!! NO NO NO!!!"}
{"text":"Service was just adequate with a very nice but strange waitress.

Food is also, again, just adequate.  Some dishes are good, others bland.  

Overall I probably won't go back; there are just too many better options in Madison."}
{"text":"This place delighted my college experience. I feel lucky that I found this place in my freshman year, back when it was on the other side of the street. I usually order lamb entree with soup on the side. The chick pea soup is really great. The pita bread goes great with either the sauce they provide or the soup. 
I come from Xinjiang, a Uyghur autonomous region in China so I grew up eating Uyghur food, which is a relative to Turkish food just like the people are. So naturally when being abroad for too long and I miss hometown food I look for Turkish cuisine, look for lamb kebab. Here I found it, not quite like what I eat at home, which is less spiced, but my energy got fully charged every time I go because this is the closest dining experience to that at home I can get."}
{"text":"This has been a destination in Madison for me and my wife (from the Chicago suburbs) for over 8 years, but unfortunately today was likely our last visit. On our way out today I noticed the publications and awards on the walls are from 2008/2009, so it seems the restaurant probably peaked at that time or just after because it was incredible the first few years we visited. 

We noticed some things changed for the worse when they moved to this current location from the former first floor location across the street with wonderful outdoor seating. The service quality went down significantly and the vibe completely changed. 

Today we went for lunch around 2:00pm. We noticed a full house and over 4 minutes passed before we saw a single staff member to seat us. Apparently everyone came at once and some staff called out sick so they were short staffed. I recall this being an issue at our last visit a year or so ago as well, so I don't know that I buy that. The staffing issues caused every used table to remain dirty throughout our entire stay, and we were served by two different people (one frantic and one who seemed miserable being there.) 

A few other things: the place needs a deep cleaning, they no longer serve their traditional Afghanistan bread that we loved and instead they now serve dry whole wheat pitas, the soup doesn't taste the same and instead tastes more like canned ingredients, it also didn't come with the yogurt sauce on top like it used to. The entrees were flavorful and enjoyable, but unfortunately too many things outweigh that positive for us to return."}
{"text":"Stopped on a very cold, late, night the day after T-Day.  Asked about good places that might be open that night and they suggested this place as one possibility.  I gave them a call and they answered.  I re-checked the suggestion with reviews on Yelp and they were decent so we went.  I liked the ambiance of the place (warm and relaxing), and the smells were strong and excellent, the food was great.  The service was good as well.  I would recommend this place to visitors and residents."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to an Afghan restaurant, so I can't speak to how it compares in that respect. I had chicken curry with couscous and I thought it was delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, not at all dry, and the curry and cous cous were tasty. My friend really enjoyed her meal as well, she had the lamb curry. My beer was awful but it wasn't anything they recommended, just something they keep in stock, so that's probably a matter of taste. The waitress was fabulous even if it took her a minute to notice us!"}
{"text":"Okay. Three stars because I wasn't a fan of the food, but the service was great. I must also give credit to Kabul's attempt to offer genuine, authentic Afghan and Mediterranean food, thereby adding to Madison's collection of ethnic cuisines. Also, I must acknowledge that although I wasn't a fan of Kabul's food, the friends I went with really liked it.

So, I won't comment further on the food or recommend anything. I'll just let you know I've tried the Qabuli Murgh and a bit of the Burani. 

Just ask your waiter/waitress for a recommendation and get different dishes than the people you go to Kabul with so that you can at least try more variety if you end up not enjoying your own dish."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Kabul is back, and, from the large crowd present during a recent visit, the rest of Madison is as well. The new space is nice, with a large bar in the middle and a lot of seating. It's unfortunate it cannot be on the street level where it would be more visible, but I hope the great reputation and following keep it busy.

The food is as wonderful as always, Middle Eastern with a unique Afghan twist. We have loved this staple of Madison for years and were saddened when they were temporarily closed for a forced relocation when their building was torn down. 

One of the things we love most about the Madison food scene is the ability to find tastes from around the globe. Chinese, Thai, Greek and other unique flavors can be found in most mid to large cities, but Afghan food is something more difficult to find. Plus, they are often open on Christmas and other holidays, which makes it a great place to visit when no one else is open.

Portions are generous, seasonings are to perfection. I feel like I'm eating healthy when I dine here since someone actually makes the food from scratch rather than buying pre-made versions from a wholesaler. I'm a big fan and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Good food, good value, overworked waitresses. The best parts: I enjoyed trying Afghan cuisine - the soup that you can choose to accompany the entrees (I forget the name) was fantastic. Chicken with curry was also very tasty - the chicken practically fell off the bone. The lamb kabob was good, although the meat wasn't as tender and had a lot of fat. Worst part: we waited almost ten minutes for a waitress *after* we were seated. She was quite friendly, although it was clear the wait staff were understaffed that day. The restaurant does have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  They gave me tomato soup out of a can, Lipton tea, and Uncle Ben's rice and called it \"Afghani.\"  My advice is to avoid."}
{"text":"The salmon dish is amazing. Not only was the salmon cooked well, slightly medium rare, it was accompanied by a dill, pimento, light cream and white wine reduction that adds to the delicate flavor of the salmon. Very thoughtful and elegant dish. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm old enough to remember when you didn't have to schlepp up stairs to eat Afghani food, but that was also when we thought everyone learned lessons about mucking about in the Hindu Kush from the Soviet-Afghan War. The food's remained consistently good since, but why no vegetarian soup? (Man, this review is all over the place--here's the upshot: good food, don't start a land war in Asia.)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was great. My lamb kabob was above average, but the Karayi Bara that my Dad ordered was amazing. The house soup was great too! Oh, and the chutneys were yummy, as well"}
{"text":"I've been to Kabul twice- once for lunch and once for dinner. I was happier after the lunch as I felt like the lunch menu pricing corresponded better to the quality of the dishes. I had the Sambosa appetizer (very good), Lamb Curry (good taste, but would have liked it more tender), and Burani (ok). My friend had the kabobs and was quite happy with it. My favorite part of the meal was the bread that came with an amazing green chutney sauce."}
{"text":"Not to be deterred by the new second floor location, finally reopened after the iconic street level restaurant was forced to close due to new student housing construction, I happily entered a world of culinary bliss, If there can be a more exquisite meal had anywhere up and down State Street, please let me know; otherwise, treat yourself right and set your taste buds free. Positively perfect cuisine in each and every way!"}
{"text":"Afghan is not just a blanket.  I need to get out more, I had obviously never had Afghan cuisine before.  A picture menu would have been great.

I had the vegetarian burani with salad.  When I asked what the dressing was I didn't expect it to be \"curry cucumber apple\" dressing.  There's a combination I have yet to try.  It was good in an interesting way.  The burani was eggplant and other vegetables topped with yogurt sauce and mint.  The eggplant was cooked in a spicier sauce.  It was an entree of contrasting temperatures and flavors. 

The hubby got soup and curry chicken.  The soup was good, but his curry was utterly amazing.  The meat was so tender it was literally melting in my mouth.

Everything was very flavorful and well cooked."}
{"text":"Some things were really good such as the stuffed chicken breast and the bulani. But some things were not good at all such as the lamb kabob. The taste of the food was not very authentic."}
{"text":"This Madison classic is one of the few old family restaurants on a state street which now seems to be acquiring more and more chains. 36 years old, it has stayed in the same family from father to son. As it's on the second floor across the street from its previous spot across the street, it can be difficult to find. With clean white walls and tastefully exotic art, this hidden gem is worth a bit of a search.

Every time I've been there I have had friendly and efficient service and wonderful food. Our server recommended the stuffed chicken and we chose the  vegetarian karayi (just looked up how it's spelled). The stuffed chicken was beautiful with a sweet and smokey flavor that complimented the well seasoned spinach, feta, and mushrooms inside. We were equally impressed with the eggplant which was very tender and had a warming sauce that contrasted the mint yogurt sauce which was drizzled on top. 

Also, try the Turkish wine. I haven't been able to find it anywhere else and it's delicious. Also, great basil cucumber martini! Overall, totally 5 stars."}
{"text":"While my first experience a few years ago was less than great....round two proved to be nearly perfect. 

Great service.  Outdoor seating on bustling state st creates great atmosphere.  Umbrellas shaded us from the intense sun.  reasonably priced wine- good selection.  

Out appetizer of stuffed artichokes was phenom.  We split the special which was a vegetarian pastry- feta, tomato, mushrooms in a phylo dough covered in tomato basil sauce.  Maybe it wasnt traditional afghan but it was DELICIOUS.  we also had pita with the two house dips and a delightful salad.

all around great meal."}
{"text":"My go-to Madison lunch spot!

My most recent Madtown visit was during a rather unfortunate St Patty's Day pub crawl (or maybe it was just drunk kids running around yelling at 11am in green t-shirts). This upstairs location was a beacon of sober hope in a sea of annihilated kiddos who didn't look older than high school.

Simple decor, fairly quiet, super low key. Despite a help wanted sign, we were greeted and seated quickly.

The mashawa soup was deliciously flavorful. Part of me wishes it was vegetarian so my boyfriend could have tried some, but the other part of me would definitely not want to give up the tender meat. If you're a n00b to Afghani cuisine, I'd liken it to middle-eastern-does-chili. Hearty and wonderful.

The Tunisian spinach stew is certainly not a plate to pass up. Huge chunks of perfectly seasoned veggies. The BF said, \"this is the kind of food you eat and then have a bunch of energy after, which you realize later is how every meal is supposed to be.\"

And I could eat the bread all day, every day. Love love love this place. Don't sleep on it!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some Afghani food but don't know where to go? Well, Madison isn't THAT far, and there's plenty of other stuff to do on State street to keep you occupied for a day!

The last time I was here was when flip phones were just starting to get popular....yes, I said flip phones!

Today, they have changed locations so that they are across the street somewhat from their old spot and they occupy the upstairs...what great people watching! 

The food is better than I remember, but, I'm not as picky an eater as I was back then either. I remember having had the Qabuli Murgh all those years ago. The dish stuck in my memory because there were carrots and raisins in it....a very odd combination to me, but oh, how it worked! It's still on the menu, but today I opted for something different.

We were a group of three....hubs, his sis and me. He suggested splitting an appetizer 3 ways and then sis and I splitting an entree while he got one for himself. I know, it sounds bad, but his sis and I have very small appetites, so this was actually a very smart way to go and we still ended up with leftovers!

We started out with the sampler platter which consisted of hummus, bulani (fried potato and scallion filled pastries), tabouleh and baba ganoush served with yogurt sauce. A la free chips and salsa, warmed pita bread with roasted pepper spread and cilantro chutney were brought out too. Tabouleh...... I get why people like it; it was very fresh, but raw veggies taste gross to me! I picked out the scallions in the bulani and then thought it was very good! The hummus was garlic-y goodness and the baba ganoush was perfect! I've had it at other places where it was as sour as a lemon, but here? Perfection! Pepper spread, another awesome condiment I am newly in love with. Chutney? Don't love it, don't hate it, don't mind it. Sis and I split the Ginger Chicken: breast meat sauteed with ginger and garlic in a light curry sauce with artichokes. Light curry is definitely true! I am a curry lover and, although the dish certainly smells curry-licious, the flavor was very light and mild. Highly recommended for a curry newbie. The artichokes....cooked to perfection. No fibrous parts to chew on, at all. Let the accompanying rice soak up the sauce and enjoy! Hubs ordered Lamb curry: pieces of lamb leg with mushrooms and spinach in a light tomato curry sauce. There were also potatoes in it, but they aren't listed in the menu description. He let me try a little...another delicious dish! Everything seemingly melted in my mouth! Entrees come with either soup or salad. I chose soup, he picked salad. The salad is Romaine based, not iceberg, a definite plus, and hubs reported that the dressing, a very light cucumber concoction, was a nice change. The soup (Mashawa) had onions, chick peas, kidney beans, split peas, chicken and lamb in a tomato-y base topped off with a dollop of yogurt. How many words are there for delicious? For dessert? Baklava, or as they call it, Baghlawa. We split it three ways and our server, a very friendly, kind and funny Russian exchange student, went out of her way to find us the biggest piece. It was served with a piece of lemon candied in honey on top. Am I saying delicious too much? 'Cause that's what it was....yummy, yum, yum, yum!

I don't think there are any Afghani restaurants in the Milwaukee area, Kabul, so if you're ever looking to open a second location, come on over, we'd LOVE to have you!

{"text":"Soup was pretty bland and not particularly flavorful. Both chicken and lamb dishes were equally unimpressive. Service was ok. The temperature inside was a bit uncomfortably hot. The whole experience just left me wishing I'd gone down the street and found something else."}
{"text":"I love this place just as much as Husnus and agree that they are very similar.  I have only good things to say however, and my review for Husnus could basically serve for this place as well.  Especially good for a nice lunch! 5 stars."}
{"text":"I like Kabul's flatbread and chutney a lot. (Each table has two chutneys, roasted red pepper and cilantro.)  The salad dressing is very good, but the salad veggies are your conventional iceberg lettuce, bitter carrots, and mealy pink tomatoes that were probably shipped 2000 miles.  I usually order the salad anyway (since the only soup is non-vegetarian) and then dip the bread in the dressing.

Veggie entrees are in a separate section of the menu, so they are easy to find.  Some of Kabul's entrees are mediocre, but I *love love love* their veggie strudel (which is not on the menu but the never-changing \"specials\" board).  It is a spinach, feta, and mushroom streudel in a flaky phyllo dough crust, and it's topped with a spicy tomato sauce.  I also get cravings sometimes for their veggie ashak or their fasuliya, both mildly spicy veggie dishes served with yogurt sauce (though I remember thinking they were pretty hot when I was a teenager).  The entrees are all reasonably priced.

For dessert, try the firni!  It's great."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant...I had a particularly powerful experience while dining here, so much that I even took pictures of the meal and wrote a detailed blog post about the meal I had here.  People who are concerned about the war and terrorism plaguing Afghanistan may find my post somewhat interesting:

http://cazort.blogspot.com/2010/08/afghan-tea-afghan-food-and-afghanistan.html

I don't really have anything I can say about the authenticity of this place, because I haven't had much exposure to Afghan cuisine.  What I will say about the food here, it was simple, but very good.  This is not extraordinarily complex cuisine--a simple bean soup, I had a dish with rice, eggplant, and yogurt.  But everything was balanced, delicately spiced, and fresh.  The meal was just the right amount of food for me.  I ordered tea and the tea was outstanding--black tea with lots of cardamon.  The black tea was aromatic but smooth and I happily got a second cup.

Service was outstanding.  I can't think of another restaurant in which I've had better service lately, and to my knowledge, there was only a single waitress handling the whole place--a smallish restaurant, but fairly busy with the lunch crowd.  The waitress was courteous and attentive and the food was served promptly.

This restaurant was FAR above the average quality of restaurants I've sampled in the Madison area.  I would definitely come back here, although I'm also eager to try out other Afghan food, both in Madison and elsewhere.  I find the other low reviews puzzling.  I found the prices here to be very reasonable, especially given the good service and pleasant atmosphere.  I understand that it's possible this isn't the best or most authentic Afghan food out there (I'm not one to judge this, however, and I personally thought it was tasty and interesting, without judging authenticity), but the 1-star ratings seem baseless and unnecessarily negative.  Does someone have a bone to pick?"}
{"text":"Some of our food was good, service was pretty bad. Hostess was flustered and confused. Service very slow...others seated after us were almost finished eating before our food came out. The bartender who brought drinks to the tables had attitude. We had to flag down a bus boy for pita bread, it finally came 15 minutes after our hummus appetizer appeared. Seafood kabob dried out and overcooked. Spinach stew boring. Hummus wonderful as was a meatball dish. Really good mojitos."}
{"text":"+2   the cilantro pesto

+2   seafood kabobs, in wisconsin
+1   spacey sweet staff"}
{"text":"Best single place for lunch in Madison. I've eaten here at least 50 times over the years and it's always consistent and affordable. 

Spinach stew has about two strands of spinach--it's mostly potatoes--but it's hearty, healthy, and good. Koftachalow (meatballs) are enormous, and easily enough beef to feed two, for only about $8. Burani (eggplant) is rich, oily, and very tasty with their bread. Bulani (fried dough with meat or potato) is a decadent appetizer to rival anything on state street, for only around $5. 

Kabobs are also a winner, with large portions. The seafood kabob is tasty and low calorie if you don't overuse the yogurt sauce it comes with. Lamb kabob is classic and goes very nicely with the rice and side sauces on the table.

Food comes with a heavy bean/lamb soup or a salad. They also have great tea.

Prices are great, but service reflects the cost. If you're in a rush you're better off at the Med Cafe a few doors down, but for a nice hour-long student-budget lunch with a slightly disorganized staff this is your spot near campus."}
{"text":"All around an excellent restaurant.  Quality food at reasonable prices, thoughtful decor, and large portions. Chicken with pomegranate sauce is delicious, despite the boring name."}
{"text":"Really good salad... not so much on the hummus. If I wanted stewed green beans, I would have ordered them. You don't have to put them on top of my delicious chickpea spread.

Also please warm up your bread."}
{"text":"I thought it was just ehhh, I had the veggie ashaak here  I wish it had a little more flavor... My coworkers enjoyed their dishes .. also when I was here there was a weird guy sitting alone ... there was some homeless guy getting arrested and he jumped outside  and started yelling inside and outside restaurant about a conspiracy theory ... I got a show with my dinner ..."}
{"text":"Fish curry here was good, and for a long time was all I would order.  My last visit they didn't have fish curry so I ordered the koftachalow.  It is a spiced meatball, split peas, onion, and a tomato based sauce served over rice. It was tasty but not quite flavorful enough.  I should have ordered lamb instead of beef. 

One great thing is they offer many varieties of lamb entrees, which I always appreciate and should have stuck to. 

Pork is not on rotation here, in fact it's not on at all, period."}
{"text":"Try the lamb. 

Seriously.

Just do it.

Service is impeccable, it's an intimate space and there are a number of very good entree choices, including vegetarian and pescetarian options. The Kafta is solid, the soups are very good and even the salad vinaigrette is very nice. This is another great State Street eatery.

Oh, and try the lamb."}
{"text":"Dear Kabul,

You did not impress me at all.  I'm giving you 3 stars only because I'm such a lover of alfresco dining, and you offer that.  

The food was blend cause you forgot to use ANY spices.  The rice was not basmati, but pilaf....very disappointing.  

Please visit Kabul House in Rolling Meadows (Chicago area) and see what Afghan food should taste like."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Our Ukranian server steered us to wonderful dishes, one of which was not on the menu, so be sure to ask!!"}
{"text":"So glad i came here before they move in a few months. Just wanted to be able to say I've been to there original location.

Burani - The tanginess of the yogurt really pulled the flavors of the eggplant, tomatoes and beans together. Next time i want to try it with the meat sauce. Feel it would add a  whole extra level of flavor since it's basically sauteed eggplant with a tomato sauce with green beans with the veggie sauce.

Chicken salad- fresh crispy lettuce, well seasoned chicken. wish i have ordered extra. Good amount of grilled veggies. The curry cucumber dressing was refreshing but not strong in curry flavor. Good but misleading name.

Friendly service, Loved the lighting and atmosphere at night. Hope the new location will keep it going."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, then I decided it wasn't that great and didn't eat there for a few years. Recently went back and found it to be much better than I remembered, especially the stuffed chicken with spinach and feta in raspberry sauce, (which I previously swore off because last time it was bone dry).  Also, I took a friend here who hates ethnic food, and he ended up really liking the meatballs. Yay. Even if it's inconsistent, it's still better than Husnus. What do I base this on? absolutely nothing, but I seem to recall getting dumped at Husnus once, or wait, maybe that was Kabul...hmmm....well, it's better than the Saz, which is gone anyways...."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Kabul for years, and let me tell you - This is a really special place. The food is phenomenal and portions are great. Don't let the 3.5 stars deter your, this place has regulars returning daily, for a reason. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is soooooooo good.  I ordered a vegetarian dish and words can not explain how good it was.  Enjoy!!!  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Om nom nom I cannot get enough of their salad dressing, kabobs, and their bread with the delicious dipping sauces!!! Always leave this place stuffed and with leftovers."}
{"text":"The naan and sambosas are delicious for appetizers. For dinner, I ordered the Curry Chicken and wasn't particularly impressed, but my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Couscous and we both loved it. If you like coffee, you should definitely order a cup here. They brew it with cardamom, which gives it a really nice, unique flavor. 

The service was a sub-par. Our waitress was not very friendly or attentive. But the atmosphere is nice and cozy. The prices are pretty decent for what you get. Would recommend if you want to do something different for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food and the service are excellent. The soup is a must have."}
{"text":"Service was good. Ambience okay. Food was not good. The lamb was not properly cooked and the vegetable dish had carrots of the size of a wooden log. Unfortunately the owner couldn't care less."}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch rather than dinner. I went for dinner once and was not impressed and it was a little expensive. Best part of lunch is the dressing on the small salads, the lentil soup and the flatbread.  On the tables they have yummy sauces you can add to your meal. They make the flatbread and it is delish! You can even buy some to go."}
{"text":"The value of this place is absurd. 
Came here for dinner given that I'd had cheese curds before and wanted to try something new. 
Ordered 2 entrees: the curry chicken and the Tunisian Spinach Stew.

Both dishes come with a soup/salad AND a basket of a naan/pita thing with chutney. The dish itself is also bigger than the size of your head...so yeah, TONS of food.

While the chicken was extremely buttery and tender, both dishes lacked, surprisingly, flavor. Perhaps I am ignorant and that's just how they season their food, but I thought both were under-salted and missed some of those curry spices that I'd been expecting at the very least. 
The soup actually was more flavorful than either entree, and the rice was saltier than anything else I ate that nice...hmm.

All in all, three stars because what Kabul lacks in taste it makes up for in value...so being located in a college town really has a lot going for them. Also, the taste wasn't bad...it just didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"\"I was so much more impressed than I thought I was going to be.\"  -J

The food here was really mostly great.  Sambosas and Lamb Couscous were particularly delicious.  We walked away very full for a reasonable price, and the service was decent.  Also, they were repainting the in store \"Take Out\" sign - hooray for restaurant improvements!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the flat bread with chicken and it was delicious!  The yogurt sauce was just right and the chicken was also very tasty.  Before my meal came out, it was served with soup (forgot what the name was, Mashawa I think?) and the Afghan bread which were both so satisfying.  I also got a rosewater lemonade.  The server was friendly and I left the restaurant feeling full and satisfied.  Also, the prices were VERY reasonable."}
{"text":"Meh. It was fine, but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken. But they ignored the mistake as if it's how the dish comes out. Maybe I'm ignorant to Afghan style beef. Or maybe they were to lazy to fix the issue. Either way they handled it terribly. And the service was lacking. Bleh."}
{"text":"Went with some friends and we ordered stuff to share.  It was quite excellent.  The food is vaguely reminiscent of north Indian cuisine, but with a slightly different spice palate.  The only downside was the somewhat indifferent service and the low-quality ambience."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Kabul Restaurant since maybe 2003 or 2004, and I couldn't quite remember my previous experiences. After wandering down State Street during a recent visit, we decided the menu at Kabul looked suitable.

I like the feel of the place. The inside is relatively small and cozy with several booths, a few two-tops and other tables.

I ordered the ginger chicken. It was spicy and tasty enough, but I wasn't completely wowed by the dish. It came with a choice of salad or soup and flat bread. I opted for the soup, which was pretty good, and I enjoyed the bread which could be dipped in a cilantro or red pepper pimento sauce.

The service was OK, but not astounding. There was a point were I was in desperate need of water, and almost had to drink my boyfriend's water, but the server came around just in time.

Overall, I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit this restaurant the next time I'm in Madison. If you're at that end of State Street and you're looking for a good ethnic eatery, I'd suggest Buraka."}
{"text":"Went here for my fiancee's birthday for lunch, and even though they did not have what we initially wanted (since they ran out the night before), but the dish we had was amazing! I can't remember what it was called, but it had veggies, a tomato based sauce, and two poached eggs with a side of bread, and it was so good! 11/10 Will come back the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"The appetizers trumped the meal. About 5 of us are here on travel for work.  We heard from a local college student that this place was freaking awesome.  ALL of our meals were really bland. I was disappointed but I did enjoy the bread, hummus and soup."}
{"text":"This is my third visit.  Always good with fast, helpful service.  Varied ethnicity of clientele make for an international feel.  For me, that enhances the experience.  Now closed as it is being relocated to another building."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECIEVED!  I have enjoyed many a meal at kabul in the past, but will never again return.  After ordering up a tasty plate of chicken and saffron rice the dish came to the table with plain white rice, no saffron TWICE.  this was annoying but not the worst part.

We threw in the towel and asked for the check and the waitress tried to charge us for the uneaten mistake meal.  When we ask for the bill to be recalculated it came back as $4 less, somehow for a $10 dish.  

Best part was that as we were figuring out what the REAL check would be, we could hear the entire waitstaff calling us \"rude, f-ing rediculous, etc...\"

Needless to say we left no money, and I sincerely hope it was taken out of the waitresses check."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars***Decent entree. Had the lamb with spinach and rice. Really enjoyed it. The hummus was bland though. Service was better than expected. I ordered an extra rice to go, and was not charged. Nor was i charged for my club soda. 

Will return."}
{"text":"Foods what you expect.  Average ambience."}
{"text":"Oh Kabul, what happened?  Back in the day, you were one of my favorite spots delivering quality service and food that was some of the best in Madison.  Fast forward to now and it's a shell of it's former self.  Service was molasses-like throughout the meal and with only 2 other tables occupied, inexcusable.  We ordered sambosas as an appetizer and they arrived rather dry, desperately needing the accompanying dipping sauce.  All 3 of our dishes also suffered from severe blandness.  Where is the punch of flavor and spices that they used to have?  The worst was my dish-lamb sabsi chalow.  Other than the lamb being tender, it was a complete miss.  
I can overlook a bad dish but given that everything about our experience was forgettable, I don't see a return visit."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last Memorial Day weekend. Really good ginger chicken curry and kabobs. We also had the sambosa appetizer which was quite good.

I don't understand the low ratings given by other reviewers - there isn't a huge dining variety on State Street and I am rather happy that Kabul restaurant is out there."}
{"text":"Delicious, unusual food, cozy interior, pleasant waiter.  We started with an appetizer of fried flatbread with potatoes and scallions inside, warm and soft.  Soup with beans and lentils followed, and then our entrees were a lamb curry and a ginger and artichoke chicken.  The lamb was stewed to fall-apart consistency and is a must-try.  My only small complaint was that the entrees were heavy on the vegetables and light on the meat.  However, there was more food than we could eat, anyway, and it was all so fragrant and tasty.  Our meal was accompanied by many cups of cardamom-infused Afghan tea.  For dessert, we couldn't decide on the firni (rose petal-infused milk pudding) or the baklava, so we ordered the \"special dessert\", which includes both!  It was a beautiful presentation, dusted with pistachio crumbs and blueberries.  We will most definitely return to dine here on future trips to Madison."}
{"text":"Worst food u can ever imagine .. if u dont know anything abt real kabul food , u might like it a lil .. but if u have eaten real afghani food .. u ll throw all the food in garbage ."}
{"text":"I've never met a restaurant named \"Kabul\" that I didn't like.  This one is my third and it is no exception to that rule. I had dinner with a friend here before a performance at the Overture Center, so very convenient to that venue. The second floor location has an average amount of tables and a bar. We were only one of a few tables on a frigid night. As a huge fan of Middle eastern fare, I had no trouble finding a toothsome and nicely spicy meal. Actually most of the spice was in the chutney which accompanied the bread and in the Lentil/bean soup which came with dinner. We ordered curried chicken and a chicken kebab plate, The later had hummus and cucumber yogurt sauce. The chicken was charred beautifully, was tender, and flavorful. Service was relaxed and our meals came quickly. The thing which stands out here is the great value, which happily is often the case with Mediterranean food. Two dinners with tea, no dessert and tip for around $36.00."}
{"text":"In what was a hastily pulled-together outing, three friends converged from three different sides of the city , and they found themselves on Madison's crown jewel that is State St.... 

I had heard of Kabul before, and was aware of its status as a Madison staple, and of the fact that it recently relocated,... with the obnoxious, yet intriguing monstrosity that has been dubbed \"The Hub\", the landscape of Good Ol' State, and Lil Ol' Coolsville, is changing at a pace that is likely too rapid for it's own good, but regardless of your feelings towards that fact, it is nice to see a familiar face in the sea of ever-changing businesses in this central location. 

My visit to Kabul was disappointing. I was excited at it's vegetarian options, and looked forward to an escape to the Middle East. First, let me just say that the space itself is very pleasant. The lighting at dinner was romantic, and the birds-eye view of State St was enjoyable. There were small candles lit at every table, and the bar was colorful and a central fixture. Our waitress was charming, knowledgeable and attentive during what appeared to be a rather underwhelming dinner service. In general, the first impression was excellent.

The food, on the other hand, left something to be desired... I ordered a dish of spinach dumplings, which descended upon the table quickly after ordering. I was disappointed that the dish was totally cold, even though I took a bite right away. Perhaps it was the yogurt sauce it was drenched in. Perhaps the dishes were not timed properly. Whatever it was, I can't believe I paid $11 for it. The green beans on top were clearly from a can, were mushy, and had a disconcerting aluminum aftertaste.... The portion was too small for the price, and even after snacking before the meal, and after eating two pieces of bread and a small salad that came with the meal, I was still quite hungry. I wish I had sent the plate back.

Given the generally good reviews, I suspect Kabul was having an off-night. But it is still concerning to me, as there appears to be a quality issue with this dish, and perhaps some issues with the procedures in the kitchen. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place.  They have outdoor dining which was perfect!!!!  Our waitress was awesome, very attentive and extremely nice!  The chutney/dipping sauces for the bread was DELICIOUS, I wanted to lick the cilantro stuff off of the plate.  I ordered the special that night which was a stuffed chicken with spinach and feta with a cranberry sauce and a side of couscous which was AMAZING.  My sister had the Moroccan chicken was was also FABULOUS!!!  I highly recommend this place.  Great food, great service and great wine!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times on visits to Madison and always enjoyed it despite comments of one reviewer.  Menu seems a bit more extensive than that of Afghan restaurant in Chicago and it is centrally located on State Street.  Like the soup too."}
{"text":"Love the new space, very nice atmosphere! I've been a customer at their old location for years.  If you like Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, this is the best place in Wisconsin.  I've had Lamb Subzi, and my girlfriend had Salmon, both were excellent.  In addition, try any of the appetizers they're all great.  We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Attentive service. Delicious food served at the right time - no piling up or waiting for food. Generous portions. I had the chicken curry which had some warmth but was not overwhelming. My husband had the vegetarian strudel (phyllo dough pinwheels) beautiful and delicious as well. We had bulani for and appetizer and our meals came with soup/salad and pita bread. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place was so good! I wish I lived in Madison so I old eat here more often. The waitress was friendly, the had delicious tea and very flavorful food. A must try!"}
{"text":"Dear Kabul,

Give me the recipe for your soup. While you're at it, give me the recipe for your salad dressing too. I need bof'um.

I know I've neglected you. After visiting you at least once a week for four years, I just disappeared. I know it's hard. For you and me both.

I miss the spiced lentil soup with fresh herbs and yogurt. Nobody else doesn't it like you. I also miss that dill salad dressing that my roommate bought from you in bulk on a weekly basis and never shared. 

I look forward to receiving your recipe secrets by mail soon.

Love,
Annie

p.s. I hope that bad server with the glasses still works for you. He was an awful server, but really cool."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, dearly miss the Mashawa soup now that I live in Colorado. Great food, awesome atmosphere for first dates and romantic evenings. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Looking for something new to try and this hit the spot. Went for lunch started with the bread and dipping sauce which were delicious. I had the chicken with peppers and onions in a very tasty tomato sauce seasoned perfectly. My daughter enjoyed the chicken curry and my other daughter ordered the ginger chicken which was a little too spicy for her liking. Service was ok considering there are not that many tables. Definitely recommend if you want to try something new. Think of comfort food."}
{"text":"Going right in with 5 stars! I read an article in the paper about their soup and recalled that I haven't been to Kabul since I was in college when I was first exposed to all the ethnic food Madison offered. On a cool windy fall day, we stopped in for lunch. My first thought was \"how the hell does this place stay in business on the second floor?\" It was 12:05 and we got the last table by the window. Within minutes the place was full. Based on my experience it must be regulars that come back (upstairs) for the food. The spicy and hearty soup hit the spot on a fall day. The warm Afghani bread was perfect to soak up the complimentary tomato chutney. I was so pleasantly surprised with everything about this place I can't wait to go back. We didn't drink but noticed the beverage list was reasonably priced (bottle of Louis Martini Cab for $29, $4.50 pints of Hopalicious)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I fell in love with Afghani food in Bloomington, IN and since then it's been nearly impossible to find good aushak, or even mediocre aushak.

Well we found it. It's decent, but it doesn't hold a candle to Samira's. Oh well; the search continues.

Could be my fault as a vegetarian but it just didn't do it for me. Get that eggplant thing though. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Madison. That's right. Better than Mediterranean Cafe.  I said it.

I can't remember a meal that we were not happy with here. I usually order the spinach and feta phyllo pie and the flavors are spot on. My husband usually alternates between the Karayi Murgh (chicken with poached eggs) and Kofta Karayi (meatballs). We love the spice and the sauces with these meals. One bothersome thing is that the poached eggs are usually hard-poached--not sure if that's how they're supposed to be, but we love a good, runny egg.

It's a little hard to find things for the kids to eat--we try to get them to try different things but the spice in many of the dishes are great for us but not for them. We've ordered chicken kebobs for them, which were moist and delicious. We've also tried the Bulani, which is a fried in an eggroll-like wrapper and filled with potato and egg and served with a mint yogurt sauce. My kids decided to just stick to rice, which was fine with my husband and I because we maowed.

The little things here are great, too--I love the taste and texture of the rice (and I grew up eating rice every day), the Afghan bread is soft and delicious--we like it so much we buy it either here or at Woodman's for our meals at home, and the curry cucumber dressing on the salad has a wonderful taste that I ought to try on my own salads now that I think of it.

And we've usually received excellent service. Our first time there, actually on a trip to see if we wanted to move to Madison, our son was barely 15 months old and he was tossing rice left and right. I attempted to pick up every kernel and our waitress insisted to just leave it alone, that it was her job to clean it up. Not that this is the sort of place where families regularly come with babies all the time, but to be treated like guests rather than nuances left a big impression on us. When it gets busy I did sometimes feel a little ignored, but I don't think that was the intention.

I'd love to give Kabul 4 1/2 stars, but alas, I can't. The few problems that we've come across, plus the fact that they probably don't use very many local products causes me to lean towards 4 rather than 5 stars. But if you are in the mood for Mediterranean food in Madison, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"High quality food. The stuffed chicken is my favorite, filled with flavor and very savory."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was beyond atrocious. Soup came late and we were told it was being made fresh yet it magically appeared barely warm. The food took 30 minutes to arrive and we had to ask for bread on three separate occasions. In addition the side salad was never brought to the table and when we told the waiter to cancel it he brought the check with the salad still on it. This is the sort of place that you eat at every few years and enjoy the food but once you re experience the service you realize why you didn't want to go back in the first place. Do not recommend unless you enjoy small portions, long waits and incompetent wait staff!"}
{"text":"Great food with snappy service.  Lunch and dinner offers different selections, but both offer either soup or salad.  Order both since salad dressing is delicious and the soup is to die for.  Large enough entre portions to split.  Second time to eat here and I planning one more visit.  One thing for sure, don't miss the baked artichoke hearts with Parmesan cheese as a appetizer.  Not sure of the name, but also a must is the eggless, custard dessert with fresh blueberries, rasberries and strawberries. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Kabul is a nice joint when you're looking for Middle Eastern food. They usually have two or three dishes which can be made vegan with simple fixes. One of their dishes is a wonderful mixture of herbs, spices, chickpeas and spinach. Portion sizes are good and prices are reasonable, in the $9-12 range. They also have excellent hummus and pita bread. If they had more vegan options, I'd give them a higher rating."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Visited for lunch last week while visiting from out of town.  Had the soup and burani on recommendations from Yelp.  Both were very tasty and I plan on coming back to share this gem with others next time I'm in town.  Service was friendly and the new space was nice."}
{"text":"I went here on a trip with the program I'm with for the summer. Thank god, because I didn't have to pay for the awful, awful food I got. Not worth your time or your money. Don't go here."}
{"text":"How much can you love a restaurant? Read my review and you'll find out. 

From Texas, I made several trips to Wisconsin to trace my family history at the Wisconsin Historical Society. I fell in love with Madison from the instant I set foot there. State Street and the area felt like an old friend. I liked it so much, I had to move to Wisconsin. Couldn't find a job in Madison, so lived in Milwaukee, but made it into Madison for more research every chance I could, and ate at Kabul often. 

The first time I tried the mashawa soup, i thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I liked it so much, I had to find the recipe so I could make it myself. And have. i couldn't convince my husband how amazing this soup was until he tried it himself. And then begged me to make it. A little lamb, multiple types of beans and legumes like lentils, chickpeas and green and yellow split peas, a wonderfully hearty dill-flavored broth, and just a tiny bit of heat. Plus a dollop of yogurt sauce on top. It is the PERFECT food when it's cold outside. 

The service here can be hit or miss, but the food makes up for it. 

The Moroccan Lemon Chicken (although technically not Afghani?) is my favorite here. One day I had a friend join me for genealogy research, and I took her here for lunch (technically dinner, since we were eating so late), and she too was convinced of the awesomeness of Kabul. 

The day I had to leave Wisconsin, and the awesomeness of my old friends, State Street and Kabul, was a sad day for me. I'm planning another visit back as soon as Walker is removed from office, so I can celebrate.

If you happen to find yourself in Madison, do yourself a favor and stop in here."}
{"text":"It's true, Husnus is superficially similar, but they're unique from one another. Husnu's rice is greasier, good, but greasier. The Turkish coffee here is great for a coffee lover. And above all, the stuffed chicken is amazing, one of my favorite dishes anywhere period. It's not amazing enough a restaurant in general to be five stars, but that stuffed chicken... mmm."}
{"text":"Like many places on State Street, Kabul has a nice outdoor patio and that's a huge plus. Given the area, service is pretty good, too. But the food is merely okay. I'm not a fan of the venerable American tradition of soup or salads being included in a meal. The reason being that most places just serve you a pretty mediocre soup or salad and roll the price into the cost of the food that you order. Kabul is no exception; although they had a pretty interesting curry dressing, the vegetables themselves were paltry and slightly bitter. My main dish of Qabuli Murgh tasted fine, but seemed more like a collection of assorted ingredients than any sort of cohesive dish. It was less than I was hoping for. Maybe other items are better."}
{"text":"This place has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The food is delicious and the ambiance is really good and there is great lighting during the day. 

The food is delicious as well as the tea which, if you order it, comes in basically unlimited quantities. 

I have now been there a few times and each time I have been there I have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"After the heavy foods of Thanksgiving, I decided I needed something with less meat and more vegetables. Enter Kabul and its Tunisian Spinach Stew.

We walked up the stairs and were immediately in the usual Afghan restaurant decor: soft red lighting. I don't know why exactly this is, but every Afghan restaurant I've ever been in has this exact same affection for a lot of lush red everywhere. Kabul was actually pretty toned down in comparison to a few other places I've been with more natural lighting from the windows and bare wood floors. (What, no thick red carpet, red velvet chairs, red velvet curtains, and red light bulbs? Seriously, there's a place like that in Munich.) It made distinguishing what was actually on my plate a lot easier, and I'm glad for that.

Service is way slow here, so prepare to just hang out for a good long while. However, when we finally got our food it was definitely worth it. I loved my Tunisian Spinach Stew. It was flavorful and perfect for a chilly fall/winter day. If you're looking for a place that you can be in and out of within in an hour, this isn't it. This is a place that is going to take some time out of your day, so bring a book or a friend and just enjoy the space and the food."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place-the food is flavorful and all the dishes we had were very good.  I recommend the veggie pastry and the spinach stew.  However, the menus were filthy and they didn't have bread....apparently they make it each morning but today they ran out.  So we got hummus for a table of 5 people and each got a small piece of bread that may or may not have been from previous customer's bread baskets.  In this situation, the cooks should drive to the store to buy some....or offer a discount considering half of the dish is really missing.  After having no luck finding a place with pita, my Dad ended up running over to Potbelly's (we were desperate...that hummus was good!) for some bread.  That's just terrible!"}
{"text":"It had probably been 10 years since my last visit to Kabul. Warm spices floating down State Street on an idyllic summer's day brought me back. Sitting outside on their patio under the shade of an umbrella drinking Afgan iced tea (with light notes of cardamon) how could I not be happy? Throw a great lunch special (salads or soup come with your entree) and I'm a happy camper. I used several pieces of bread to mop of the delicious meat sauce I had covering my eggplant rounds. Substantial food that didn't make me feel too full - the perfect compliment to the beautiful day."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the lamb curry entree when I dined here, and it was both flavorful and tender. The bread served before dinner was warm and served with two amazing chutneys. I liked the cilantro one so much that I went back to purchase some to go with my leftovers. The Afghani iced tea was unique and refreshing. I would gladly return here."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but I guess that made me expect my meal even more eager. My personal favorites are their chicken kabobs, the lamb is really good as well."}
{"text":"Started with an awesome cup of Mashawa soup, pita bread and some afghan tea. While the starters were fresh and tasty it took awfully a lot of time for our main courses to be served and it was not even a busy day. I had the chicken kebob and the wifey ordered fasuliya, the food was good but it was not hot since it was not served as soon as it was made."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Kabul and with Afghani food in general. The restaurant is located in an upstairs location on state street. There is a bar area and a dining area, although there did not seem to be a very large amount of tables for seating, so I assume it can get busy fast. I went on a Wednesday night at around 6pm and we were still able to get a table and it was relatively empty, but it got busier throughout our time at the restaurant. I ordered the Lamb Couscous. It came with mushrooms, a variety of veggies, sauce, all over couscous, with a side salad. The food was hot and had good flavor, and everything tasted great. I will definitely come back to Kabul in the future to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"You won't get a bad meal here, you won't get a great one.  If it were the only Afghan place in town I'd probably go occasionally, but there's another one I like better, Maza, right across the street.  Bottom line:  I wouldn't object if a friend wanted to eat here, but I'd never pick it myself."}
{"text":"Have been dozens of times and always get the same thing because the curry chicken is so delicious.  My husband always gets the lamb curry and loves it and my daughter can't get enough of the soup and salad.  Great fresh and slow cooked food."}
{"text":"One of the better quality food serving restaurants. You can get shaving lamb here. Vegetarian options make me happy and are yummy. Like to go every now and then. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in Madison WI and find yourself on State Street looking for some good, Middle Eastern cuisine, skip this place.  The chicken is of the same quality and texture as McDonalds.  They try to cover up the poor quality of meet and produce with curry which only distracts you momentarily.

I had the ginger chicken and the Burani.  Not good, not awful.  Just....mehhh.  The beer I had from Turkey was good though :)  

Hope this helps."}
{"text":"When I was attending UW Madison (1996-2001) I ate here religiously.  They offer a great variety of vegetarian options and the food tastes different than anywhere else -  truly unique.  I remember the salad and their homemade house dressing even being so good, that I would purchase a container of it to go.  They also give you this flatbread with your meal and I love dipping it in everything - the dressing, the hummus, and the sauces from the entrees.  And you can buy a whole flatbread to go, which makes for an awesome pizza crust!
  
My recent visits to Kabul have been good, but something has changed since 1996-2001.  The salad used to be quite a bit larger, have cherry tomatoes, purple cabbage, carrot strips and the curry dressing was fluffy and rich.  Now the dressing seems watered down and the tomatoes are sliced and very cold (don't put your tomato's in the fridge or freezer!!!).  The hummus used to be outstanding and now it is a hit or miss (sometimes being very granular).  The entrees are still very good and I would love to visit this restaurant more often.  It's not terribly expensive either.  But I wonder if it's under new ownership or they've changed the cooks... or are they getting lazy? Cutting corners?

I don't eat the meat soup (Mashawa), but my parents who would visit me while in school did.  My mom loved it so much that she had to try and make it at home.  Went to Kabul about 4 times in 2011... recommended the soup to my meat eating friend the last time I was there and it looked extremely watered down.  Nothing like the way it did 10 years ago.

Please Kabul!!! Don't lose your integrity!  Return to the upstanding quality that was once something to really really brag about (******) and recommend to everyone.  I will still crave this restaurant until the day I die."}
