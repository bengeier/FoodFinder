{"text":"Pizza was amazing and fast. We are travelling with 3 kids and popped in for lunch. It was so good we are going back before we leave Montreal. My kids are usually picky about pizza sauce but all loved it. The dough is unbelievable - thin and delicious. Staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Thin, crispy crust pizza. You get to pick your toppings or choose the ones on their menu. They make it right in front of you and is ready in minutes! Very, very delicious pizzas and very friendly staff. Would definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"This is a must dine casual experience while in Montreal!  I visited the area for business, read the reviews and decided to visit as it was very close to my hotel.  It was fantastic pizza and I added a lovely Cesar salad with homemade dressing.  The staff were exceptional!  I called the owner to say what a fantastic job Patrick, Emmanuel and Paul had done on welcoming me to the restaurant!  I will be sure to visit each time I am in town!"}
{"text":"You walk in & realize the storefront belies its depth and space.  You're immediately greeted by the pizza makers who make your pizza, to order, right in front of you.  Pizza \"pies\" are individual sizes (about 4 nice sized slices). We ordered one pepperoni, one ham & pineapple, and one mushroom.  All were on a traditional flour base w/ tomato sauce & mozzarella.  All of them resulted in excellent single serving pizzas.   Meat & veggies tasted as fresh as they looked. Very good pizza in the middle of Montreal - & I'm from NYC."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when they said my pizza would be out of the oven in 90 seconds but it was and it was amazing. The place was empty when we got there but soon had a fairly long line. I had the Al Fungi. It was perfect. I can't understand why the line is not out the door."}
{"text":"Go here! Great place, incredible food, and fast service! The owners are super friendly. Yelp is making me write a longer review in order to post a review so please ignore these filler words. Go Cowboys!"}
{"text":"That's some good Italian Pizza right there! Friendly staff, quick service and though slightly pricy definitely worth it. I went for a Signature Pizza, but I really like the concept of being able to create your own pizza exactly the way you want it. Bonus: their Wi-Fi is reallt good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! Great concept! Our 5 year old loves watching her pizza being made in front of her eyes! X"}
{"text":"As good as any of the made to order fast pizza places that are popping up recently. Service was fast and friendly. Pizza was good, crust done just right, a little crispy."}
{"text":"If you love pizza then this is the place for you friends! First time here and they explain how it works. My pizza was cooked to perfection! Super friendly staff and very reasonably priced. The place is spotless. You just gotta eat here!!"}
{"text":"Best gluten-free pizza crust I've had, in the 6 or so years I've been gluten-free.   Everyone who was working there including the co-owner who I had a chat with, was outgoing and helpful.  And the cooking process is incredibly quick.  I hesitate to call it fast food because the ingredients are healthy and of quality, but, it was literally, \"fast\" preparation.  Place has good karma."}
{"text":"Clean, quality pizza spot in the middle of Old City. FYI: there is major cross contamination here; their gluten free dough is cooked in the same ovens as the regular ones and there is flour all over the place, so be weary if you have Celiac or a wheat allergy."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great service.  This restaurant makes wonderful pizzas, with many healthy and fresh toppings and dough for vegetarians as well, and the prices are very reasonable as well.   We had such a pleasant experience we came back the day after to get another taste ;)  A must for all pizza lovers around the old port of Montreal.   I would also add that both times the staff were very friendly, thoughtful and pleasant, taking the time to make the experience as smooth and tasty as possible."}
{"text":"Ingrédients très frais. Pizza est faite sur mesure devant vous. Une boule de pâte est préparée d'avance et transformée en croûte mince devant vous avec choix de pâte normale, à blé entier ou sans gluten.   Liste d'ingrédients proposés. Le service est très rapide. Ils ont 3 fours puissants pouvant faire de délicieuses pizzas napolitaines. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de places assises, mais sur un mercredi midi, il ne semble pas avoir de problèmes, car plusieurs prennent leur pizza pour emporter.   Différentes huiles et sauces (tabasco) sont à votre libre service pour assaisonner la pizza.   Ils offrent également un choix de 5 salades simples et santé que nous pouvons prendre en entrée ou repas.   Ils offrent la pizza et bière pour 15$. Très abordable pour un dîner au centre ville près du palais de justice."}
{"text":"The pizza here was so good. The slices were almost too thin because the toppings were not staying on as well. I love thin crust pizza though and their crust was thin and crispy! The ingredients were very fresh and of higher quality. The prices were decent."}
{"text":"Decent experience overall. They had a small rush but the service was slow -- waited in line about 15 minutes, 5 of which was because the person assembling the pizzas was out of tomato sauce. They were hand-tossing the dough to order, and the pizza ovens looked suitably Italian, which was a plus. Pizza was good but not great -- Nepolitan style crust was not bad. Likewise for the salads; Caesar tasted a bit off -- the dressing tasted like it contained mustard. Glass of red wine for CAD $6 was very good for the price. Solid and inexpensive option but not memorable."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and amazingly courteous staff! Would definitely go there again (and again)!"}
{"text":"Un concept extra,   Sérieusement ce restaurant est très populaire et il le mérite.   En bref, c'est un restaurant \"make your own pizza\", cest parfait pour moi. Du salamie au aubergine epicées, ils ont tout les ingrédients parfait pour manger un excellente pizza.   Franchement, c'est une bonne alternative au fast fodd traditionnel !"}
{"text":"We are huge wood fired pizza fans, we were not disappointed in the least. The size of the pizza is very generous and we now have leftovers for tomorrow. Crust is excellent and there are lots of toppings. If you are looking for authentic wood fired pizza you will really enjoy the flavour and variety.  I also had a spinach salad, it was delicious! Nom nom!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza in an unpretentious setting.   Lots of interesting options (I had a white pizza with mushroom and garlic) and fast service (you order at the counter and the pizzas are ready by the time you have paid).   There was nothing left on our trays!"}
{"text":"As earlier reviews mentioned, we walked in and were promptly greeted by friendly faces, the menu was explained, and the pizzas were ready in 5 minutes.  Clean, courteous, efficient, reasonably priced, and the food was delicious!  And they have wine!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. They throw on a generous amount of toppings, cheese and sauce. The only thing that could be better was the crust, which couldn't really handle the 3 toppings and got a bit soggy, so I had to use the fork and knife (I'm not classy enough to do that) and wasn't airy enough. Still, it wasn't all that bad. The service was good and quick too.  Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Super bonne pâte fine (au choix: trad, complet, gluten free) et une pizza ~14$ avec 3 toppings. Tout ça cuit en 2min. C'est la bonne occasion de manger une bonne pizza vegan ;)  Le personnel est super sympa et le lieu aussi. Une bonne adresse pour une bonne pizza rapide!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a light dinner offering and pizzeria bros menu offered good selections. Their crusts are thin and perfect. The are not paper thin or cracker toasty. The base tomato sauce is well seasoned. They have a good selection of toppings, however, when we went they did not have fresh mozzarella... This was disappointing to me. Nonetheless, I was impressed that they offered nice condiments, including chili oil \"olio santo.\" Very tasty pizza and numerous possibilities to create your own winner pizza! Plus, they are reasonably priced gourmet pizzas."}
{"text":"It seems like my pizza cravings have me continuously checking out local pizza joints to \"make your own\" pizzas. This stop was Pizzeria Bros that has held positive reviews by fellow yelpers for quite a bit of time now. Walking in-the space was small but well organized with its seating. The first thing that caught my attention was the daily special that changes every day- you get a full pan sized pizza with your choice of non-alcoholic beverage for 13$ without tax. Their regular menu included assorted pizzas, salads and pastas. Beverages included soda and wine. I didn't have to wait long to get my order. The staff was quite entertaining sharing their own insight about their experience working at the restaurant. The pizza crust of my Sicily pizza was baked perfectly and thick enough to hold the toppings- hot peppers, tomato sauce, red and yellow peppers, mozzarella cheese - I paid a dollar extra to exchange pepperoni for prosciutto-perfect combination of salty and spice!  I was able to finish all my pizza and bottle of Perrier- I was happy that I wasn't stuffed but happily full!"}
{"text":"The gigi pizza is exquisite. Very friendly and helpful staff. Loved being able to watch them make the pizza in front of me."}
{"text":"Good fresh hand made pizzas with great vegetarian options. We were a large group of 11 and ordered around 8 different pizzas. All pizzas were really good with different topping options."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas we've ever had. Choices are endless and so worth the money. Order their specialty pizzas or be adventurous and make your own, I guarantee you'll love it. We ordered different base sauces and toppings and shared slices. The person manning the dough was very accommodating and readily explained how things work.  Service was quick, easy and friendly.  We're from NYC and will definitely drop by this place when we visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for wood oven pizza!! The service is super fast, infredients are fresh and you can make your own pizza  Tasty !! We go there for pick ups usually. Once or twice a month."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!! Somebody start advertising this place!!! Go here! It is also very fast. By the time you pay, the pizza is ready! GO HERE! (Joshua, age 10)  In addition to my son's review, I would add that the pizza is very fresh and full of flavor. We came here on a very rainy April evening. There were two professors debating the merits of science and politics in one corner. A lone man sitting in another corner, and my family of hyperactive children. We were welcomed into what felt like a locals-only corner pizzeria, and felt right at home."}
{"text":"Très bonne pizza faite devant vous Vous pouvez choisir les ingrédients ou prendre des recettes déjà toute faites  Pâte fine très bonne  Seul bémol le prix est le même qu'un resto servi à table"}
{"text":"Brand new pizza place! They opened this Monday right above Atti, a Korean restaurant. Pizzeria Bros now has two locations in town, the other one being in Old Montreal.  My brother and I went there yesterday for dinner. We're curious about any pizza place because there's a serious lack of good, greasy and dirt cheap pizza downtown, but Pizzeria Bros does not answer that need. Nevertheless, they do serve very good pies! It's like Pizzeria No. 900 or Moleskine, only faster, 2-3 bucks cheaper, with shiny red microwave-like ovens and a build-you-own-pizza counter. The guy at the counter was super amicable and informative. We picked \"La BROS\", one of their signature pizzas -- and it was ready in a flash! The dough was prepared, the sauce was layed on, cheese was added, into the oven it went and out came a picture perfect pizza. Fresh toppings were then added in front of our eyes: arugula, cherry tomatoes and parmesan shavings. I think they only have one pizza size, which is designed to feed one person: its about 12 inches in diameter, which is a decent meal. The pizza was nice and thin, and althought the dough was not as tasty as that of fancier restaurant, the whole thing was very good.   With more than 10$ per meal, it is still a bit steep for the student population, but I'm sure there's plenty of business people downtown that will love this new lunch option. Speaking of options, they have an impressive array of toppings, ranging from anchovies, sundried tomatoes and pancetta --- to Nutella and mascarpone! Pizzeria Bros is only accessible through the building entrance right now, but they are planning on building a street entrance. Exciting changes to come!"}
{"text":"cancelled the uber eats delivery at the time we were supposed to receive it, after having waited for 45 minutes and not a peep from them otherwise. stay classy."}
{"text":"Went to this place based on Yelp reviews. Lineup on Tuesday night was long which was a good sign. Ordered the salsicchia pizza and a side garden salad. Pizza was amazing! Crust was chewy, perfect thickness, sauce and toppings were delicious.  Side salad is a typical old school Italian side salad, really fresh and tasty. Was only visiting Montréal, but would go here again next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Great pizza when eaten real hot. The owners have the system down pat. And the combo of their dough and red sauce with the salt level is the winning combination. Pizzas don't take more than 3 min but when we came it wasn't busy. The best part is it's a simple menu with specials and salads. Beverages to add. That's it. It's not a full blown Italian joint. So decision making is simple.  My gripe was in addition to 10$ for a 10 inch thin crust pizza, you add $1 or $1.50 for every topping with hot is no more than 50 grams each max."}
{"text":"We were hungry, everything was closed and this place was like a beacon of hope. We weren't sure what we'll find. What we found was delicious, satisfying, well priced pizzas in under 5mins. You could get creative and make your own or if you're tired there are some options that you can choose from. Husband went for the Al-Funghi and I went crazy with a double cheese, extra garlic tomatoe-y pizza. Both on wholewheat which tasted delicious. We had both with drinks for 30$. This included leftovers for the next day. We patted ourselves on the shoulder for stumbling onto this place completely by accident. We're definitely going to be stumbling in again!"}
{"text":"The pizza this restaurant serves for the customers is different from what I usually have at general pizza restaurants. The name of the pizza I enjoyed is called Gigi. First, the thinness of the pizza is stunning, which makes the pizza pretty crispy. Second, there are wide range of pizza toppings at this restaurant.For example, the cook actually put a special kind of bacon on my pizza,and it is really tasty as it is similar to Chinese preserved meat.  In a word, Pizzeria Bros is a worthwhile restaurant for pizza-lovers to visit."}
{"text":"Adrian, Andrew and Patrick know what they're talking about. Don't even bother creating your own. Let the boys take care of you and let them design your pies. Thanks for taking care of us, Gents!  Much Love,  Rick and the boys from Vancouver"}
{"text":"One of my favourite pizzeria along with Il Focolaio.  Food: 5/5. Italian style pizza served in five minutes. The crust is thin, except for the gluten-free crust that looks like a naan (also delicious). Some pizzas are a bit too salty to my taste (the one with dried tomatoes) but overall it's good. There's a counter where you can add olive oil, oregano, tabasco, chili, etc.   Staff: 5/5. Outgoing, reliable, nice, fast.  Atmosphere: 4/5. Clean and casual.  Price: 4.5/5 pricy but worth every dollar. Except for the $2 extra for the gluten-free crust, that's too much."}
{"text":"Solid pizza, we were a bit surprised just how good it was... Yes, it is a little over priced but you are right down the street from the basilica so I am guessing rent just might be a bit higher... Totally worth it if you need a quick bite... Please add honey to dip the crusts!"}
{"text":"The owner was very friendly - he spent some time chatting with us at our table and recommended some other places to go. The pizza was fresh and ready in only 90 seconds! #delicious"}
{"text":"Another place near McGill that values appearance / convenience / speed over food quality. A make your own personal pizza place a la Brigade Pizzeria, but that uses counter-top pizza cookers instead of a real oven to prepare your pizza quickly. The result is what you'd expect from a 90 second cook time; flatbread like dough, cheese that does not adhere to the sauce and dough, and a general taste of cheapness. Their toppings seem to be of grocery store quality as well. I got the 'Bros' signature pizza, and overall fairly disappointed.  This place would be fine if the prices matched the quality of food, but I assume their demographic is business people looking for a quick lunch the prices reflect that. None of their 'signature pizzas' are below $13 pre tax and tip.  2 stars for the kind and fast service."}
{"text":"A make your pizza place, You tell them what you want on your pizza from the choice of dough to the sauce to the toppings."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after exploring the gorgeous Old Port area. It was around 9.30pm and we were feeling a bit peckish. We liked the sound of customizing your own Pizza from the windows so decided to give it a go, not knowing what to expect.  We immediately were made to feel very welcome with one of the guys making the pizza explaining the process to us and knowing that we wanted a quick bite so were going to share. Unlike some places, these guys understand if you don't want a pizza each! I loved the sound of whole wheat base and decided to go with one of their own vegetarian options. The pizza was ready in under 10 minutes and it was definitely one of the best pizza's I have had. Perfect ingredients, super fresh and full of flavour!  I loved the rustic type interior with hanging lightbulbs and a brick wall... Very cosy! They also have a help-yourself table full of chilli oils, flakes and parmesan cheese. No need to wait around, just grab it and go. The staff were all super friendly and price is very reasonable. Will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Gr at pizza and cooked soooo fast under 5 minutes.  They are individual pizzas see my creation of spinach, portabella  mushrooms, artichokes and button mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal, we'd eaten an early dinner, but found ourselves hungry later in the evening. Pizzeria Bros was literally downstairs from our Airbnb, so we called and ordered a big spinach-pecan salad and a dessert pizza with nutella and mascarpone. 20 minutes later we were tucking into a delicious salad, which after 2 days of booze and poutine, we desperately needed. The dessert pizza, though... good god, that pizza. It was crispy and warm, and after spreading the mascarpone around to mix with the nutella, it was heaven. Not sure what their regular pizza is like (and I've heard that pizza in Montreal is generally not great) but I'd bet it's decent if the dessert pizza is anything to go by."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fast service on a weekend lunch! Their pizza is pretty amazing and cooked fast. It was probably done in less than a minute. As we finished paying and picking up some napkins and water, our pizza was already done. Wow!  You can start with the featured pizzas with fixed items on the pizza or go a la carte to choose your own ingredients. $1 for classic items and $1.75 for more \"deluxe\" items like prosciutto. We started with their fixed fungi pizza and customized on top of that. The guy who made our pizza explained things really well too. They also have whole wheat dough for the more conscious healthy minds. We opted for the whole wheat dough too. My wife and I share the pizza and an arugula salad. They both taste great! Will be back for sure whenever we visit Montreal again.  When you pay with the machine, you will be presented with the option of 5%, 10%, 15%, or no tips. Given it is really more a self serve restaurant, I think you are OK if you decide to not give a tip. We gave a 10% tip just because it was our first time and the guy was very friendly and patient to go thru with us how the whole process was supposed to work."}
{"text":"Great Pizza but they made it too much into a fast food than a pizza spot."}
{"text":"Chill place. Very friendly. The cheese was on point, just wanted to put that out there."}
{"text":"Grest service, fair prices, fresh ingredients. The place is SUPER clean oh and the pizzas are cooked in 2 mns or less wanna find out how? Pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza - wide variety of fresh and delicious toppings. Staff welcomed us and were very helpful in creating our own pizzas, which took 2 minutes to cook. The crust was crunchy and thin but very good and were complimented by a choice of flavored olive oil. Definitely a place to visit for a quick bite in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  The 4 cheese pizza was delicious.  We also created our own which was ended up pretty good too.  It's 1 person per pizza, because they are not super huge.  They make them right in front of you and they it only takes a few minutes to cook in those little ovens.  The guys working there were very nice too, especially explaining how it all works."}
{"text":"Soggy pizza. Either undercooked or their base sauce is too watery.  The bottom of the pizza it's just wet.  The pizza slice won't even hold its shape!"}
{"text":"Good staff but the pizza is just terrible!   We asked for a goat cheese pizza and they were extremely stingy with the goat cheese portion ( I mean just charge me extra and put more cheese guys!).    We ordered 4 types of pizzas and 3 of them were pretty bad and one was okay.  Not sure why everyone is so fond with this pizza place."}
{"text":"This is a place definitely worth trying! Located conveniently in Old Montreal, this restaurant serves made to order pizza with all the baking done in front of hungry eaters! We tried \"Gigi\" on white and \"Al Fungi\" on whole wheat which are all done fresh and crispy!"}
{"text":"Seeking a nice, light dinner that even our 7 year old would enjoy, we stumbled upon Pizzeria Bros.  Because we eat too much pizza, we wanted something different - we continued to seek out our options.  Our 7 year old insisted on Pizzeria Bros . . . Guess we'll listen to her more often!  Thin, light crust that isn't over browned or hard, fresh toppings that are light; even the Italian sausage wasn't greasy.  When in Montreal near the Old Port area, this is a must stop for lunch or light dinner!  Thank you for such a pleasant, friendly environment . . . Total win!"}
{"text":"Wow! J'adore le concept! C'est comme un do it yourself de pizza! Un peu le même style que laitue go ou encore subway, mais pour pizza! Je capote ! Le meilleur dans tout ça ?! Elles sont cuites à une vitesse fulgurante et tu peux manger en dedans d'une heure ! Et la pizza est tellllllleeeeeement bonne ! La croûte est mince et croustillante et les choix de garnitures sont infinis ! Que veux-tu de plus?! Un bas prix?! Eh ben tu l'as! Arrête de chercher une place à dîner et va manger une pizza DIY tuuu suite !   Pour les indécis et ceux qui ont horreurs de faire des choix, ils ont aussi un menu ou des pizzas déjà assemblées te sont suggérées! Malade !! :)"}
{"text":"I am so impressed! The menu is well laid out and the specials are relevant. The pizza was made in under five minutes and it tasted marvellous!  I had a pizza with the pomodoro sauce, traditionelle crust and hot peppers.   Go here now."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place to get out of the cold. We really weren't hungry, but thought we should get a couple pizzas as we wanted to stay inside to warm up. They only have personal size pizzas. Being a pizza snob from NY/NJ, I had low expectations. Made to order, had to choose my dough type, sauce type, and toppings. Went for traditional ingredients. A few minutes later, boom, pizzas.....Wow were they excellent! I'm a thin crust guy....Check. Just enough burn on the crust....check. Flavorful sauce and correct amount of Mozz....check. Cheese and spices to add. Friendly service....What else could you ask for? Unless you like thick, or non traditional ingredients.....(Sorry Chicago and California :). Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"If it were just up to the food, I would give this 3 stars, but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful as I was navigating the menu for the first time. Pizza was good, not great. Big portions, and love the idea of making your own creation."}
{"text":"Great pizza that the kids loved. Limited seating for large groups.  My family of 6 needed two tables.  Worth the walk."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff. Answered all of our questions and gave suggestions. I also liked the different choices in dough- traditional, whole wheat, or gluten free. I opted for the Greco (feta, olives, spinach, tomato) on whole wheat. Cost $13 and was ready in less than 5 minutes. Thin crust and was perfectly sized for 1 person."}
{"text":"Couple of steps away from the main attractions of the Old Port of Montreal, my wife and I on a Sunday night were looking for a treat :)! And here we are on Notre Dame in front of Pizzeria Bros : debating if we should eat and where to eat ... Sunday nights are always against the clock because Monday is around the corner ! But this pizza place was able to grab my attention : ready in 2 minutes !   Right away I told my wife here is our pit stop. As soon as we stepped in, we were welcomed with a nice smile by all 3 employees even tho they were busy preparing pizzas for a small group ahead of us ! The decor was really gorgeous, felt very warm and rustic ! My wife and I looked at each other and were a little disappointed that it wasnt a wood-fired oven ! But we really under estimated the power and results of their cute red individual, powerful ovens !   The menu is clear and simple : either you make your own pizza or you choose from a selection on the board ! One size fit all (10 inches) and you get to choose the type of dough (btw whole wheat is same price as the regular white dough) no reasons not to go healthy ! The pizza was created and ready in a speedy way ' but didnt feel neglected in any way... They knew we wanted to share the pizza and even offered to cut it and serve it on 2 seperate plates ...  All types of oils, hot sauces, chili flakes were available and obviously like any authentic pizza joint - the absence of ketchup certifies the place :)  The bench were comfy and unique in its style, great place for a casual date, a nice quick corporate lunch and price is VERY reasonable for the area !  I was told 2 best friends that were so close that they called each other Brothers came up with this beautiful, successful restaurant !   I saw someone beside us enjoying a salad .. The portion looked very generous, next time for sure  A must try and retry and retry...  ***A brother is a friend God gave you; a friend is a brother your heart chose for you.***"}
{"text":"Great pizza customizable experience definitely will return here when I'm in Canada next."}
{"text":"Happy accident led us here. Great staff. Very good pizza. Who would have guessed that kale would work on pizza. One pizza was good for a light lunch for two of us."}
{"text":"My first stop on my Montreal leg of my Canada tour and it was well worth it. Before I get into the food I must say I love the location of this Pizzeria. To find it you have to walk through Old York. A fabulously quaint  neighborhood in Montreal.   Now about the food Pizzeria Bros has amazing thin crust Pizzas that are fully customizable. Customization of pizzas is not unique it's the way they specifically  do them. They are delicious and they are created expeditiously. I would return to this spot on my next visit to Montreal.   Finally I love the layout of this restaurant. It's very bright with ample seating and it seems very modern and clean. Pizzeria Bros is totally worth Checking into if your in town."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a pizza shoppe in Montreal , I was growing tired of the food. And I wanted something that reminded me of back home. We found this shoppe by just walking around and it was actually empty. So back in the states we have this pizza place called Blaze pizza same concept you build your own pizza.   The pizza was quite delicious actually. And would be fit for any lunch , brunch, or dinner occasion. The space is a but crowded.  But is cutely and comfortably organized with the seating arrangement.   I ordered just basic pepperoni pizza and it was good. Canadians make their pizza backwards, they put the dough , sauce, toppings, and then cheese. It was super interesting to eat this way. I kept thinking they messed my pizza up lol. But the toppings were actually inside the pizza. Fair pricing I believe everything came up to about 8 CA dollars including the drink. Cute little place to rest and eat after the long walking."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try in old Montreal. Fresh dough and ingredients with the pizza made right before your eyes. Awesome salads and the Nutella marscapone calzones are to die for. Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. They have a healthier option with whole wheat dough and also an option for those that are gluten intolerant. The second most important part of a pizza, the sauce, is perfect. I usually don't include pricing in my judgement but this time I shall cause I think it's a little much for what you're getting. Been here a few times already and very pleased with their pizza. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for great, speedy, quality pizza!  Toppings are fresh, menu is interesting and creative and and gluten free dough is amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gluten free crust so far!!!  It was tender and didn't get dry and crispy after being cooked.  I ordered just mushrooms and cheese and a pop and the total was $17, not really cheap, but worth every dollar.   If your looking for regular pizza or Gluten Free pizza come here it's really really good.   It's more casual atmosphere so I don't know if it would be the best for a romantic dinner or lunch but the taste was great."}
{"text":"It's fast food pizza. Nothing amazing. Good if you're hungry. The pizza cook is helpful, friendly staff, nice decor."}
{"text":"I feel like Montreal is really into make-your-own food. Burgers, Poutine, and now Pizza. I'm in. You go to the counter and choose your dough and toppings... wait a few minutes...take the baked pizza to your table. The finished product isn't anything out of the ordinary. It's definitely not the best pizza I ever had but it's absolutely fine if you're out for a casual pizza quicky. The staff is really nice. They weren't bothered by us asking questions in English. Personal advice: Don't take the key lime lemonade. The bottle looks cool but I couldn't stand the \"special\" taste."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not outstanding. It was very fast, so if you're hungry, they fit the bill."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING!!! You can choose which type of crust and toppings you want and everything was super fresh with wonderful service!!! The pizza is made to order and cooked right in front of you. The nutella and marscarpone calzones were literally the best thing ever!! You have to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Effectivement une tres rapide pizza artisanale tres bonne, quelques tables et bon service."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have lunch before/after visiting the Notre Dame Basilica. The pizzas we tried, the Gigi and the special that came with olives, were both delicious. I am not ordinarily a huge fan of olives, but these went so well with the pizza that I was converted. The pizza is an interesting mix of doughy and crispy at the same time, and wonderfully thin crusted.   The service was also great, and the place was not too crowded. Decor was modern and chic."}
