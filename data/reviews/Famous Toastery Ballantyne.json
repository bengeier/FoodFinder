{"text":"The location is convenient for us, so we decided to give it a try, as we are on the hunt of an excellent brunch place in Ballintyne.  Also noted all the good reviews Toast had received, so we were optimistic. The restaurant was busy when we got there, but we were still able to get seated right away.  It has a casual family friendly atmosphere and is very clean.

Our breakfast started off well. The coffee was good and so was the cornbread they brought out for the table.  But the rest of our meals was substandard. The waffle came out soggy, and the batter had too much of an egg batter flavor. It was as if they mixed up the crepe batter for waffle batter. The sausage patties were on the watered down bland side. My eggs Benedict were over cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was over the top with dill, and underachieved in zest. I don't think they do much scratch cooking in the kitchen. At least it didn't taste like it, and I didn't smell anything yummy coming from the kitchen.  And our table was close enough to the kitchen doors to have had smelled some food aromas - but there were none.  

The manager took the waffle back to the kitchen and took it off the bill, and that was appreciated. Our waiter was attentive and our coffee mugs stayed warm and filled.  So those are the positives.  We may give it another shot, just to see if we caught them on a bad morning.  But if the quality is that of packaged reheated food, we will cross it off our list."}
{"text":"Ran in here on a very rainy Sunday about 45 minutes before they closed for the day.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  We enjoyed the buttermilk waffle (as a special, not on the regular menu) and eggs Benedict.  The waffle was OK but did not look complete as if kitchen hadn't used/didn't have enough batter.  Bacon was plentiful but a bit limp and not crispy.  The judgment on the Benedict was the eggs initially tasted of the vinegar used during the poaching process (not pleasant) but that flavor faded.  The hash browns are the big, chunky kind often described more as breakfast potatoes.  Be forewarned if you're expecting the shredded potato dish.  Meal was pricey ($35 plus tip for all of the above plus coffee, tea and two small OJs) so I don't see making this a weekly stop.  But for an occasional meal with someone special, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great food and family atmosphere. Friendly fast service.  Healthy options for diners with specific requirements. What is not to love?"}
{"text":"Whenever we're up visiting Charlotte we eat at Toast.  We obviously eat at other places too, but Toast is our favorite.  The staff is friendly & attentive & the food is great.  My kids & I have eaten at all three locations & we recently tried their new location in Ballantyne.  
I had the left coast BLT & my daughter had a cheeseburger.  There's a great variety of choices and should be something to satisfy anyone in  your party.  The left coast BLT was Excellent!!
I highly recommend any of the Toast Locations.  We'll be back up there soon & will definitely have a meal or two at Toast."}
{"text":"I have been eating here off and on for 2 years.  My last two recent experiences are why I will not return. Both times we were sat and waited a while just to be asked for our drink orders. My food oder was wrong again and the food looked sloppy on the plate. I go out to enjoy the food and the time I am there.  This was not the case. It seems their standards in many areas have fallen. The staff has changed as well and it is not a good one."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! The food tasted fresh and came out quickly. I had a minor problem with my eggs and the manager corrected it quickly and gave perks. EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"I got the Bernie scramble (only noticed it at first because of the name) but it's maybe the best eggs I've had. With smoked salmon, capers, goat cheese, an creamy eggs, it was better than most other brunch restaurants. The servers were nice and checked by our table regularly. Definitely coming back again to try the stuffed French toast!"}
{"text":"this place is extremely overpriced for gross food. the staff is really nice but the food has no flavor and you're overpaying for even the sides. don't come here."}
{"text":"I drove by The Village at Robinson Farm and thought it to be cute and wanted to check it out. I stopped by The Famous Toastery to have breakfast. I was instantly greeted by 2 hostesses. The dining room was 25% occupied. I was surprised when a server asked for the spare menu on my table. It seemed more important to him to grab the extra menu than offer to take my drink order. Fortunately, a more personable server came to take my order and bring my beverages. The coffee was okay, but I have to say that I have not had coffee served with a soup spoon in it before. The spinach mushroom omelette was supposed to have Gruyere cheese - I did not see or taste it. No seasoning either. The fruit was not sweet and there was no offer of butter for my thin cinnamon raisin toast. The cashier did take $1 off for the absence of cheese in my omelette."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, crepes were flavorful and hot. Lots of staff, friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nothing special but it's a pretty standard breakfast done well.  Restaurant is very kid friendly, which is great and the service was quick."}
{"text":"In reviewing the food, just the food, I'd give it all 5 stars.  I've been here twice and both times everything my party ordered was great.  We aren't the most adventurous crowd, we tend to stick to the breakfast basics, but they're still darn tasty.

Service was a little chaotic and therefore slow.  People running around everywhere (literally).  I can't tell if it's the table layout, the training, or some combination of both.  If they can fix their service issues, I'd give them a 5 star review."}
{"text":"The food was good,  service excellent, and atmosphere great.   I liked the pancakes,  hashbrowns, and toast.  My eggs weren't cooked the way I wanted, but that was my fault.  They were   accommodated my son.  I  enjoy  here again."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food that was served fast (9am breakfast on an Tue). 
I had the avocado omelet with potatoes. Delicious!
Atmosphere is simple in a good way. Not too much visual clutter."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! 
Visted for brunch and was very pleased at the speed and service of the restaurant. We went as a large (13 people) group and our server was very patient, sweet, and extremely nice! 
I had the avacado omelet with grits and wheat toast - fantastic! I can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu that my coworkers had.
Local artwork featured as the decor made it more artsy and gave it a homey feel."}
{"text":"The Potato bacon cheddar bisque will blow your skirt up!  I thought it sounded kind of gross but quickly changed my mind after tasting it.  They don't offer it every day thought.  They have great quiches and fresh fruit but all quiches aren't offered every day either.  They always have a special or daily feature and they post it on their Facebook page daily.  Their diced potatoes are excellent and the wait staff is so friendly, you won't have just one waiter ....  you'll have them all.  The only downside is the noise level in the restaurant, at times I feel like I'm yelling to my boyfriend across the table but the food is great."}
{"text":"I got the Buffalo chicken wrap. While I'm reluctant to complain about the abundance of chicken, it would be more visually appealing (and lower food cost) to reduce the amount of chicken and add some lettuce and tomatoes to the wrap. The chicken was really good. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast eats! Amazing food, great & friendly staff! Really feel at home the second you walk in the door. Whether you're looking for a simple meal or an extraordinary omelette, you have ever found the right place."}
{"text":"I must say with great emphasis: brand-new restaurants simply write their own obituaries by leaving first-time customers dissatisfied.

Granted, it's location ensures it's main clientele are (rich) families and really fucking old people. But I'm almost certain they won't last longer then a year or two, or further the demise of turning this into a franchise, as they're assiduously trying to do.

Newly-minted Toast Cafe just opened in Ballantyne in the heart of urban planning identity-crises, \"Village at Robinson Farm\". Having tired out the Flying Biscuit over the years (more on that later), and disgusted with the strange sushi-pizza menu at Cosmos Cafe, I eagerly hoped this would be my new breakfast/lunch place.

I came here starving, and left, still starving.

We ordered:

    Half Portobello Mushroom Sandwich w/ Jack Cheese & Saut√©ed Onions on a Kaiser Roll and Tomato Soup - $8.99
    Half Turkey Sandwich and Soup - $8.99

The portions were tiny. And the Portobello mushroom sand I gulped in about two bites. Here, you get exactly what you order, no flair. Which can be fine, but summoned my few mushrooms with an overload of cheese. I saw NO SIGHT of onions. Yup. And the kaiser roll was more like-- the cheapest, paper thin white bread you could find. The tomato soup was pretty boring as well.

As a chef, I have an obsessive tendency to calculate the costs of the food I'm given. I paid nearly $10 for a tiny, tiny sandwich and a bit of tomato soup - prob cost them $1.50 max to make.

I left disgruntled, despite an overwhelming number of ppl asking me, \"How is the food?\". Yup, on their website they pride themselves on having not just \"one waiter\" per table. Which means, a barrage of different ppl asking me about the food when I'm actually not happy at all. It was boring and stupid pricey for what you get.

I also HATED the \"look\" of this place, these bland suburban paintings that aren't really paintings. Like really asinine peach and gold and beige colored things. You know, restaurant owners who open places with absolutely no creative spark. The space is huge-- but suffocated by the kind of furniture you buy at Target. The over-cosy pseudo-European shit that Europeans wouldn't actually use."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is legit.  Had the chicken salad melt and club.  They were both some of the best sandwichs I have ever had.  Very good ingredients, not your typical mass made sandwiches.  Service was great and the food got here in less than 10 mins.  Sleeping in my car right now after being so full.  Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this little place!  It's our favorite Saturday breakfast spot.  Service is always great and so is the food!  A+"}
{"text":"Oh My!!! D-elicious.... The wait time on Saturday (surprisingly) was just 10min. Once seated, service was quick & very pleasant.   
Most of the server's look so young.. (18 or under)....but, definitely knew how to keep the tables moving on a busy Saturday morning. 

Breakfast was very tasty... I ordered Crab Cake Benedict.. It was cooked to perfection.. Hubby ordered, the Southwestern Omelet w/chorizo, which was just as good... 
We also enjoyed the side red potatoes..seasoned just right.. 
Both happy and agreed that we will return for breakfast.. (bravo)"}
{"text":"75 minute wait for a tiny table, undercooked pancake still oozing batter, dried out cornbread, an egg scramble cooked so quickly the cream cheese wasn't melted. 3 or 4 tables empty inexplicably given the line. 
Shell pieces in crab Benedict ... if you're still reading it wont matter what else I could list."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is extremely friendly and they remember my husband and I every time we go! You are treated like family and the food is delicious! The best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted! 
I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Really like Toast! Love that the community server approach where it seems as if every server is available to help you! The food is consistent and usually there are no hiccups in quality. I typically get the breakfast burrito where the scrambled eggs are moist and never dry.  Usually on the weekends, there is a wait for a table but they offer a small complimentary self service coffee station to hold patrons over until their tables are called. Bottom line, usually a solid choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and each time was worse than the last. Once it was extremely false seating estimates (we were told 20 minute wait time) for half an hour straight, when we finally asked to see where our name was on the list, it was behind over a dozen other names and no way would it have ever been 20 minutes. The family in front of us was also told 20 minutes and they waited over an hour until they were seated. 

Another time the food was just extremely underwhelming. Something I could have just as easily whipped up at home (and I'm no chef) in half the time for a fraction of the cost. 

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this place after our positive first experience but it just kept going down hill."}
{"text":"We were there for a late lunch.

The biscuits were awesome!  The sausage gravy was very good as well.   Best part of the meal for me.  French toast was ok.  My son had a cheeseburger which looked good, although I did not try it.  The egg based dishes looked very good, but I cannot eat eggs so that was a bummer:(

Our server was very nice, but he wasn't very on the ball.  The entire experience took longer than necessary.   That's why I'm giving three stars vs. four.  

If in the area, I might try again, not sure."}
{"text":"Putting jelly in between pieces of plain French Toast does not make it \"Stuffed French Toast\"... I would've gotten waffles but the waffle maker was broken... Seriously? A breakfast place with only one waffle maker?
I find that hard to believe. The concept that \"every waiter is your waiter\" is confusing for the wait staff and annoying for customers. Pretty pricey for mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots when we're in Charlotte. Pancakes are a solid favorite as is the omelette with avocado. Coffee is fresh and strong and good. Love how they tag team service among wait staff. Great experience every time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at the Famous Toastery of Ballantyne for a month and we love it!!! The staff are friendly, courteous and  attentive. The food is fresh and awesome. Thanks for making our breakfast sooo great"}
{"text":"Sunday morning, I understand it's a busy breakfast day. We are waiting for 1 hour with half of the tables empty in the restaurant. You might consider getting some help in the kitchen. It has been 30 minutes since anybody was seated."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for the 1st time today for a late bfast.  She got the breakfast burrito, asking for no red/yellow peppers, adding jalape√±os.  She got what she wanted.  She said the food was wonderful and a pretty good value for $6.99.  I got the Combo, one pancake, one egg any style, and four pieces of bacon.  There were two issues.  I asked for the egg poached and runny.  Received an egg pretty close to being hard boiled.  No runny yolk at all.  Okay.  I didn't complain.  The pancake was somewhat large and tasted good as well as the bacon.  The second issue was the price of my meal.  For one pancake, one egg and four pieces of bacon, its $9.99.  Way, way overpriced! Idk.  There are so many bfast places in CLT that give much more food at a cheaper price AND the food is good.  We won't be going back any time soon.  I gave it 3 stars because my daughter loved her sandwich."}
{"text":"My first time at Famous Toastery was today and I decided to meet my best friend there for brunch. I walk up to the door and someone already has it open \"hello welcome to Famous Toastery\" we had a small dog with us that fits in my friends purse so we decided to sit outside. Nick the manager immediately came out and greeted us and asked us have we ever been there before and what we would like to drink. From the moment we walked in to the moment that we left it was nonstop star service! One of the servers that waited on us Spencer was on top of his game. Being that we have never been there before he went over the menu with us and told us the big sellers. My friend and I both decided on the Avocado Benny. We both decided on poached eggs and Spencer told us try it with the medium cooked yolk, you'll love it. He was right on the money this avocado dish is great for someone who is watching their carbs. Basically they cut the bottom of the avocado so it can lay flat on the plate and when they take the seed out they pour the poached egg in the hole cover it with cheese, onions, tomatoes and I think green onions. First bite... sweet sassy molassy this is good! We decided to get fresh fruit with both of our dishes. My friend got a cup of coffee but I decided to be bad and went with a Rumosa. It has in it (I think) champagne, rum, juice... I don't know all I know is that I wanted more than just one! We had a great experience, I will definitely be coming back to Famous Toastery!!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. My eggs were really cooked well. Everyone left very happy. The kids love the place."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on Saturday morning with my family. The servers were all very nice and the place had a nice atmosphere. I got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Hands down best meatloaf and mashed potatoes I have ever had! Will definitely come back and only regret not trying them sooner!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place for brunch at Charlotte. the server was very nice and welcoming.
the price was overpriced and was very busy at morning time. I am in love with stuffed french 
toast and black tea. strawberry cream cheese was very yummy.. highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We love the food but the service is lest than stellar at the Ballantyne location. We were seated in the back corner where it was dark. The server added ham to the order and we had to ask for more coffee."}
{"text":"No wait on a Saturday . They give u fresh corn bread  staff was very on top of things and the food was great very fast .. There biscuits are so good .. Hears the think I like salt and so it wasn't horrible but some things were prob a little salty . But with that being said we will be back again and again"}
{"text":"If you like eating breakfast out, Toast is definitely worth a try.

Toast (Rea Road in Ballantyne) just opened a few weeks ago.  My wife and I really like it and think it is a competitor in the breakfast/lunch category.  For breakfast they have a nice choice of omelets and not just the usual western, cheese, broccoli and cheese, etc. that most restaurants offer.  The omelets are perfectly cooked and folded and the ingredients taste fresh.  They also serve good eggs Benedict and have a nice choice of specials.  Our kids really like the pancakes, although they don't have a kids menu (but do decrease portion size).  Despite being new we have not run into any service issues and our wait time quotes have been accurate."}
{"text":"Excellent options for gluten free dining.  My husband has celiac's and we like to share, so I typically eat gluten free too.  We had the cinnamon apple pancakes and the banana walnut pancakes and both were excellent, although I slightly preferred the cinnamon ones because of the delicate cinnamon flavor.

The servers were friendly and efficient and willing to answer my questions about how it works to have no assigned tables, especially when things get busy (which they weren't on Friday morning at 7am.  Basically they have different signals they use to let each other know where a table is in the process of getting served.

The only thing I didn't love was the very strong coffee, but my husband did like it, so I guess you can't please everyone :)."}
{"text":"This is my last trip to Famous Toastery. I don't mind waiting to get a table, which is a must if you are planning to eat here.  The tables are small and half of it is taken up by condiments, so good luck finding room for your plate when your food arrives. The food itself is pretty good, and it's great that they offer gluten-free options. But this last time, we felt very rushed to vacate our table. We waited 20 minutes to get our full order, which was delivered to us in \"phases\".  The next 40 minutes while we were eating, we were approached by three staff members reminding us that we were supposed to pay at the front. The last person picked up our ticket and literally threw it back on our table.  I've never encountered this type of rude behavior before but it's certainly out of line when you are shelling out $17 per person for breakfast.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We have had better service at IHOP...  Yes, we went on Mother's Day and knew it would be busy.  Yes, there was a large number of staff supporting the increased volume of people.  Unfortunately they did a poor job, at least for us.  

My wife specifically requested breakfast at Famous Toastery even when the kids and I offered to make breakfast at home.  We had great experiences at the other locations, especially in Concord.  Since we live only five minutes from the Ballentyne location we made plans for Sunday breakfast.  There was a short wait at 9:00 which is to be expected.  We were seated at a table which may have been either too small for a party of four or had too many things left on it from previous guests.

We had to stack things ourselves just to have room for the basics.  I am not sure why creamer, ketchup, and a whole variety of jellies had to remain on the table.  The bread basket and empty smaller plates were not removed until we were half done with our meal.

The two things that just left a bad taste in my mouth was the fact that they did not even come by to refill our coffee until we were about to walk out and the way they brought the check.  The Server who brought the food just tossed the ticket at the table as he walked away.  It just felt tacky and impersonal, like \"hurry up and get out\".  

While I understand it is crowded and people may feel rushed, they should also remember there was a reason people wanted to go there for their Mother's Day breakfast.  In this case the food was ok, nothing special, but the service really sunk the experience.  It is unfortunate as we eat at Hawethornes often and live so close but it will be awhile before we give this place another shot."}
{"text":"This food is no joking matter. It is fab!!! Also surprisingly cheap for Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Food and service were both great. Price ended up being a bit high. $42 (not including tip) for breakfast for 2. 

Pros:  Northwestern egg white omelet with fresh herbs, goat cheese and grilled onions was amazing.  Stuffed French toast was also very good. Could have used a bit more fresh strawberries, but overall flavor and texture was good. Sister said the crab cakes eggs Benedict with Hollandaise was also great, but I thought it looked very low on Hollandaise. If you like sauce, ask for extra. Bloody Mary was flavorful and hearty. 

Cons:  They were out of grits, but didn't tell us - instead just substituted hash browns. What breakfast place runs out of grits? I mean, come on... It's not like they're grinding the corn themselves.  Also, the hash browns were not what I consider to be hash browns. They were more like quartered baby potatoes. Big chunks of lightly seasoned and mostly cooked potatoes. I would pass on them if I had a choice. 

There was nothing here I couldn't make myself, but I would never be so decadent to do so. For that reason, I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a typical breakfast place in the area. Usually stuffy crowd for the most part. Food is OK and I've had many times where it's been cold and the price is typical as well which is high.

Nothing really more to say"}
{"text":"Great breakfast today
Great service
Great food
Fun atmosphere
Simple...this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Talk about team work and Awesome service & you would go wrong without making mention of Toast.. 

This place is a great combination if the model of team work & good customer service with good food for the most part. My Family & I have a weekly ritual to go to brunch every Saturday as part of our Family Day Fun.

Today (Saturday - it's after midnight so yesterday) was our second visit. We returned for the good service & good food according to my family & myself for the most part. The only thing I had a problem with was my Banana Nut French. toast. I make it at home & I don't make it & put peanut butter with cooked bananas mixed with nuts (soggy may I add) in between bread & call it stuff French toast. I personally prefer my Banana nut French toast to be presented & prepared with the uncooked bananas & nuts on top of the cooked French Toast. If you prefer it made the way I described that it was made then \"Go For It\".. 
Our dishes are as follows (weekly routine after my mishap) & we are always pleasantly pleased..
Egg White Avocado, Tomato & Parmesan cheese omelette (it is on the menu with bacon but I get it minus the bacon & add Mushrooms) with a side of Fruit &Rye Toast.
Egg white veggie omelette with a side of Turkey Bacon, Cheese grits & Rye Toast..
Breakfast sandwich with eggs scrambled hard with cheddar cheese, turkey bacon on White..


The Bellini is AMAZING may I add..
Great place for brunch which is the only thing we've had as a family or individually. Very nice to Enjoy the patio while its still weather friendly.. 

Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"Famous Toastery is always on point with a great breakfast. Service is great and portions are large."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.. We've become a huge fan of going here for brunch. Portion size keeps us more than content until dinner. The pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and meats are all top notch. Service is always really good and food comes out fast."}
{"text":"People always love it here and I feel like they are keeping something a big secret. It's pretty decent food, but there are a long list of places I would rather scramble my eggs, if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"This is the only place I want to go for meatloaf, and for breakfast! It's so mouth-watering and visually attractive, thanks to the crisp-ish roasted winter veggies and the made-to-order mashed potatoes (with cheeeeeeese!). 
 Their menu is extensive, but I can't quit this habit... don't wanna!
 The service is great- as you may have several different waiters in a visit. The decor is warm and casual and the prices are reasonable. Also, it's totally consistent. 
 It's all good!
 Great, now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I am in a networking group that meets every other week and we just switched our location to Toast Cafe in Ballantyne and I'm so glad we did. The food is delicious and always comes out super fast. The servers are speedy, friendly and very polite. I am a sucker for breakfast and can't seem to get past the breakfast menu but all of the dishes I've seen look great. 

The restaurant is located in a shopping center off of Rea Rd. and is pretty easy to locate. Parking is also a breeze as it's there is plenty to go around. Important point: All Toast Cafe restaurants take payment at the cash register up front. I always forget this and freak out when the server only brings one check to the table. 

I love the Toast location in Dilworth and now I love the Ballantyne location too. :)"}
{"text":"Although it is about 5 minutes from my house, I've only been to Toast off Park road. Until now. We came in for brunch on a Friday to a pretty full restaurant. Seated right away I got the Peach Bellini and an order of biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. 

Everything came out hot and delicious. Being very picky southern girl who knows gravy, it was good. The bacon definitely completed the meal. You have the option of getting one or two biscuits. Stick with the one and get a breakfast beverage to go with it, you won't be sorry. 

The wait staff is there for everyone. It says on their menu that everyone is your waiter. They do a great job of always making sure you're being taken care of. The prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Toast, the simplicity of the menu an decorations was very welcoming! The huge dancing man in the Toast costume, didn't hurt either! 

People must really love this place we stopped in early Sunday afternoon and had about a 15 minute wait. When we were finally seated, just based on the amount of people I was excited to try out this place.

Toast offers your normal brunch variety, eggs, omelets, salads, sandwiches and burgers. 

I decided to keep it simple and try the biscuits and gravy with a side if hash browns. The food came out quickly, and it was HOT! The biscuits were flaky and delicious. The gravy was like none I've had before, it was  delicious, creamy with a hint of spice after each bite. The hash browns were my favorite! They were potatoes seasoned to perfection then cut into pieces before baked and served...add a little ketchup and they were delicious! 

The only downside and the reason I didn't give more stars was based on service. Our waitress made me feel very rushed and unwelcome. Literally, we sat down, she took our drink order than asked if we were ready to order. No time to review the menu or ask questions about the specials or favorite dishes! We told her we needed more time and then after a long wait she finally came back for our orders. 

Once she took our orders, we really didn't get to see her again. I mean really...It was our first visit, so I will have liked to hear about some of the dishes;  maybe even some of her favorites or suggestions. Or just an overall \"how did everything turn out?!?\" would have been nice. 

However, the manager Brian did come over and thank us for coming in and asked how the food was...so a small redemption! 

So sure, I will go back, give them another try."}
{"text":"The good news is that they will always make it right...the bad news is that it happens too much. 
 It used to be that we couldn't get toast well done. We would always have to send it back.  
Yesterday, we ordered a special of Baked Avocado with eggs. Sounded great and different so I went for it.  The bad news was that the Avocado was cold and not ripe. The good news is that they took it back, brought be a different breakfast and deducted $7.00.
We've always liked this place, but we are prepared to almost always have a problem"}
{"text":"We were so disappointed!! My husband and didn't feel like making our own breakfast this morning so we trekked out to Famous Toastery, which should change its name. The menu looks great, and the servers were all very nice, and the food tasted fine, but that's about it.


We knew coming on a Sunday around 11:30 might mean a little bit of a wait and we were okay with that. But when we went in to put our name on the list, they told us 35 min wait despite the restaurant only being half full - not an exaggeration either. Should have been clue #1. So they called our name about 30 min later and we were seated and our drinks were brought promptly. Had two waiters ask us within 30 seconds if we were ready to order, but I hadn't even put sugar in my coffee yet, so not quite. Eventually someone circled back to us and we ordered a crab cake eggs Benedict, a side of a biscuit and gravy and a side of French toast. 

45 MINUTES LATER the waitress told us there was one ticket in front of ours and it would be out shortly. She also told us hey have been having problems in the kitchen recently. Yea no kidding. Also, it appeared that some of the tables were offered and given toast or cornbread baskets for the table while they waited for food, but we were not given that option, which made us even grumpier. 

As for the food: French toast was fine, biscuit and gravy was fine. The poached eggs we ordered as medium were well done and not runny at all. The crab cakes were a bit dry and small (like silver dollar small). The menu said just egg on the crab cake, which is fine to skip the English muffin, but we expected a little bigger than what we got. 

On the way out, my husband noticed another table yelling at a manager. I can only assume about how absurdly long it took to get food at a restaurant that remained half full. 

In addition to the wait, I'm pretty sure their AC wasn't working because we were sweating by the time our food came.

We will not be back, at least to this location."}
{"text":"This place is good, service is great and the food comes out quickly. Nice place to hit on the weekend because he wait is not too long even when it's busy."}
{"text":"This is a really nice, interesting place with great food. There is frequently a wait but they get you in as fast as can reasonably be expected and there's FREE COFFEE while you wait. . that's right... free.... coffee... what's not to love about that. The inside is a little loud for my taste but the food and the service are to notch. Mom had a veggie omelet that was delicious and I had some eggs benedict that were also delicious. (apparently the eggs benedict is a thing with them they had several different kinds). So yeah, be prepared to wait . . . have some coffee and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times now, and we've kept going back because...the food is great, the service is great, and if you want a bloody mary or mimosa with breakfast they can handle that too.  In particular, give the \"MBS\" a try: Mushroom, Bacon and Swiss omelette.  Already looking forward to the next visit just talking about it!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Toast today since we were on this side of town and there was a line outside the building.Hey, must be great, right? 

We were quoted 15--20 minute wait, but it was much closer to 35 minutes. Luckily, we did not have the hunger horns out.  It is a good idea to quote better wait times or you can have some unhappy campers. Once seated, we received service from a number of servers. We did not know if this is the standard or due to being newly opened. We tried savory and sweet choices. The food and coffee were pretty good. I agree with Julia M., that complimentary cornbread should  have been served warm with butter/  jam or something-- will decline next time.  We will come back and try some of the other entrees. Service was decent, but really slow. Hopefully things will get better as their feet are wetter."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times after church & it's been great every time. The avocado benedict special was nothing short of amazing. You might wait a minute to get seated, but it's worth it. Great menu. Attentive staff. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We just found this new place. !!  Love it.  Cute decor .  Great menu.    Chicken vegetable soup is wonderful. Daily specials  great staff. They all work together . We will be back again.  Good food"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying out Toast this morning.  It was pretty busy and we had about a 15-20 minute wait for a table.  They have completely re-done the interior decor - enclosing the formerly open kitchen, and repainting the interior to warm and homey colors.  When it was our turn for a table, we had the choice to eat inside our outside. Since the weather is nice, we decided to sit outside.  

Unfortunately, we had a dirty table that was not prepared for us and had no flatware.  Our server came by pretty quickly to take our drink orders and brought a basket of cornbread, but still no flatware.  The cornbread was slightly sweet and tasted ok. But it would have been nice if they brought it out warm with butter in the basket. It would have also been nice to bring small plates for our cornbread. 

The menu had a decent amount of options for omelettes, scrambles, pancakes and etc.  The sides included grits, hashbrowns, or fruit.  They do offer turkey bacon as an option so I was pleased about that. 

I decided to try one of  the many specials... so I got the turkey scramble.  It included turkey, spinach, egg whites and gruyere cheese.  I went with the grits as my side along with whole wheat toast. The egg scramble could have easily been a bit bland...but it had nice texture and flavor.  The grits were not the best but were ok.

While we were waiting for our food to come out, twice someone from the kitchen tried to serve us someone else's food.  This is not a great sign.   Also, they must have messed up the order of a table close by, because I heard their server tell them that they were taking $16 off their bill. 

I might rate the food 4 stars, but service overall was off and I would rate that 3 stars.   But if they correct some of the service issues, I think they can make this place a success."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about the other locations, I was really stoked to check out the new location at Robinson Farm in Ballantyne. It's a quaint location with plenty of seating and great for a nice breakfast, brunch or lunchy style meal. 

Made it in on Sunday afternoon around 1pm and it was packed. There was a small wait, but a table for two opened up in less than 10 minutes. All of the seating is spread around and a little odd for access/maneuvering. Not a huge deal. 

I ordered the California chicken salad and really enjoyed it. Lots of great flavors - goat cheese, walnuts, avocado, good greens and the dressing was fantastic. Really impressed with this salad. I'd order it again upon next visit. 

The downsides were the service and my wife's food. She ordered an omelet that had guac and I'm pretty sure the avocados were on their way out. Just a really odd flavor for guac that didn't seem right. We ended up removing most of it from her omelet and everything was fine. Just kind of odd. Also, the service was just a little slow. It was slammed, but our server didn't come back to take our order, refill drinks, or bring the check in a timely manner each time. It took about 10 minutes for him to come back to take our order and around the same each time after that. Not a huge deal, but an hour long brunch for the style that Toast is was a little much. 

I can't say I'm rushing back to eat here, but wouldn't rule it out completely. Think they'll get some things worked out after having a few months under their belts. Cheers!"}
{"text":"By far the best biscuits and gravy in charlotte! Do yourself a favor and order it.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We were there there on a Sunday morning. We waited about 10 minutes before we were seated, which was quick considering the number of people there. 

We were seated and our drink order was taken. I ordered the eggs and hash browns with hollandaise sauce and my companion had the rancheos heuverios. They brought cornbread which I thought was ok. It was a bit dry and not a lot of flavor. 

The food came our quickly and was great. The servers were very attentive and have us frequent drink refills. When we were finished they offered us drinks to go.

I would definitely recommend this place and will return."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch today! I had the quiche -- today's was a Southwest style and very tasty!  My mom had the crab roll and I sampled a bit of it as well. It was very good as well! The side of marinated cucumbers was the perfect compliment to it. I recommend trying either one. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I got fried eggs, grits, and sourdough toast. It was simple but perfection. The grits were rich and creamy, and I'm glad to have found this place! My friend got the shrimp and grits, and they were seriously the best I've ever had. A strong flavor but not overpowering for the morning. Really delicious. I'd get that if I go back."}
{"text":"Toast used to.serve delicious breakfasts when they first opened.  I'm referring to the Ballantyne location. We've eaten there 4 times in the last 2 years, and we're not happy with the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Toast is an excellent place for a weekend breakfast out. The service is very efficient and all the wait staff seems to work as a team (anyone will refill your coffee or fill any immediate need you may have). Prices are very reasonable and the food is above average, By that I mean their eggs, coffee, corn bread, fruit, etc. are all better than what you would expect from a popular price restaurant - most breakfast entries were $8 and under- but the fruit salad was as good as you have at home, if you had a well stocked kitchen. The place is perfect for young families as service is fast and prices are very moderate. Not only will your children like it but you can bring the grandparents as they will be the only ones who will recognize the music playing. 
If you find their food is not up to your very high standards then breakfast at The Gallery or Cafe Monte or Zebras and pay two times Toast's prices; for me Toast hits the sweet spot between quality and price,"}
{"text":"A top breakfast/brunch spot in Charlotte!

I tried Toast for the first time recently and it lived up to the high ratings. It was pretty crowded when we got there but the wait was only ten minutes. There is also free coffee too while you wait. When you sit down they bring you a basket of cornbread with some cinnamon apple jam, it was very good. 

For my meal i had the \"Cali Benny\", a California twist on the traditional eggs benedict, complete with tomato and avocado. It was soo sooo goood! They poach your egg to your preference as well. I had mine cooked medium and it was perfect, runny but not too runny. It came with a side of hashbrowns which were delicious as well. 

I can't wait to go back! The lunch menu looked good as well, a large selection."}
{"text":"I had been to the one in Huntersville several years ago for one of the best breakfasts of my life. Having just recently relocated down here, I was thrilled to find a Toast here in Ballantyne. Went yesterday, and the food is as good as I remembered. The specials are original and interesting, as is the menu. The food was FRESH and flavorful. And the service was outstanding. Also, loved that they feature artwork of a local artist on the walls. This place is a great find!"}
{"text":"So good!  Only 4 stars because of price and size.  First of all, yes...we are in Ballantyne, but I still have issues with paying almost $10 for breakfast.  And size...it is pretty cramped inside and you kind of feel like you are eating with the table next to you.  With that said...the menu is fantastic and the food is a-ma-zing!  They bring out some yummy cornbread while you wait for you meal, and the food didn't take long at all on a busy Saturday morning.  I ordered an omelet, it was cooked perfectly and they let me modify it from what was on the menu.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Famous Toastery is a favorite brunch spot for my friends and I on a weekend morning. It's a busy little restaurant, but the staff does a great job of getting you in quickly. I had one of the specials today, which was a Maine lobster scramble...it made this native Maine girl's heart and stomach happy! It was huge, cooked perfectly and included just the right amount of lobster, Parmesan cheese and bell peppers. The breakfast potatoes on the side were a great addition. For those that enjoy mimosas, they have a nice selection of options including a traditional mimosa, a champagne punch and a peach Bellini. This is a great spot to enjoy a relaxed breakfast or lunch with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Two words: country ham. 

My ham and cheddar omelette was tastier and different than the typical ham and cheese omelette I've ordered at other breakfast joints. It came with a side of fruit and toast which were nice compliments to the meal. Our waitress was super friendly and the service was very timely. I would recommend this place without any hesitation."}
{"text":"Good place for a family. Very child-friendly and laid-back. My wife and I bring our little girl here and enjoy a nice slow brunch on weekends. Also, extra points for locally-roasted coffee.

Parking isn't bad either given how busy Charlotte can get on weekends and the wait is pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Same thing as Dennys at almost twice the price. Marginally decent food and service.  It was clean and food was pretty quick, even with a nearly full restaurant. Parking is horrendous when all the places there are busy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch place in all of Charlotte! Other people must agree as there is always a huge wait unless you come really early. 

They offer coffee while you wait and corn bread as soon as you sit down. Food comes out pretty quickly and service is good. 

The huevos rancheros here are my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I came here for brunch today with another couple and it was delicious! They did have a special menu out because it was restaurant week but I was the only one that ordered from it. I had crepes with fresh berries and cream cheese and it was wonderful! My fianc√© ordered the avocado omelet and he said it was a great choice. Both of our plates were very filling and I had some left on my plate. The hash browns they served were unique and tasty. My friend got the Greek omelet and she said she wouldn't order it again, it was just OK. Would love to come back here because I couldn't decide between several things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great brunch! Their coffee is just ok but every meal I've gotten is great! I once got an egg white scramble that was great and last time I got an omelette and loved it also!"}
{"text":"This place was great, large variety of breakfast dishes. I came for mother's day and there was a huge line outside, but wait was only 30 minutes. Once we were seated the staff was friendly and quick! The food was delicious, no complaints here."}
{"text":"Typically good but disappointed in the lobster roll. Worst I've ever had.  Literally 6 small bites of lobster on two rolls that were all mayo and lettuce.  Huge waste of $17."}
{"text":"A few lunches that were excellent.  Great menu, and I mean really, really great!  A myriad of breakfast and lunch choices such that you will have to force yourself to narrow down to four or five that you want and then experience the equivocation in selecting the final choice.

They had a special of fresh lobster roll.  In Charlotte?  I was getting out there, feeling very brave and went for it.  It was amazing.  Two soft rolls literally stuffed with lobster, two, not just one.  I asked the waitress and she said it was 3 ounces of meat.  Very generous.  And the meat was all claws and legs, no shreds from the body.   Quite a luxury. And a yummy mayo kind of sauce.

Soups are home made and are unusual combos.  The one I had once was corn, avocado and more, which was pretty scary, but worth having a bowl for a meal.  This experience is pretty common at Toast.

Burgers are large enough that the wait people will discourage parents ordering one for each child.  Nope.  Split it and the kids can't eat all of that.  We big kids revel in these half-pounders.

Coffee is rich and strong, like the big coffee shops.  Flavorful and the way coffee should be.

I don't do desserts, but looking around at others who do became a temptation.  Am certain that the devil  has a part in those desserts.

Breakfasts give you the standards, but also have clever, unusual choices which make breakfasts more than just a first meal of the day.  Served all day.

Too bad it is just a breakfast & lunch place. No dinner service.

One small note:  the wait staff work, very effectively, as a team.  As their menu states:  You don't have your waiter, you have our waiters.  Doesn't matter who walks by, you can ask for more coffee, a fork or whatever and they get it.  Your tips go into on pot, whether cash on the table or into the jar at the cash register."}
{"text":"It's fine for brekkie. A very plain and boring menu, nothing to get excited about. Service was good since it's a team service place. I can do better cooking at home. Lack of interesting menu selections and sticking to brekkie basics gets a 2 star. If you like that then it's a 5!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on Saturday and had amazing service and food. The lobster rolls and crab benedict were both amazing. The food came out quick and we were given coffee to go. You can tell how focused they are on service and it definitely shows. We will definitely be back to try more of menu options."}
{"text":"Since this bustling Ballantyne breakfast joint is a half mile from our house, I really, really want to love it, but I just can't get seem to get there. I can say that I do \"sorta like\" it, as due to location alone, it has become somewhat of a frequent breakfast location for me. It seems to consistently rate between 3 and 4 stars.

What I like: $5.49 two egg special, Lavazza coffee, homey dining area, attentive service, huge egg sandwiches, lobster specials, grits, real butter, Smuckers jellies.

What I don't like: The wait, service by committee, crowded tables, average toast.

They do serve lunch but I've only tried in once and found or to be average.  Sanitary rating is consistently high and the place  is well managed. If possible, I'd give it 
3.5."}
{"text":"I came here for a late breakfast. There were 2 other tables sat in the entire restaurant and our food (an omelette and a breakfast sandwich) took forever to come out. When it got to our table it was barely warm. It tasted okay until my boyfriend found a hair in his omelette. The waiter took it off our bill no problem. I'd say the service here is the only good thing. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Four stars for food quality and presentation, and options. 

Apparently this place gets very busy on the weekends, as we had to wait over 30 minutes. There really isn't much room to wait inside the restaurant so we actually went next door to The Butchers Market to kill some time (this was actually pretty fun as the butchers market has some really cool stuff!). 

The menu had a lot of good options. I settled on the Cali-Benny. It is a Benedict with egg, tomato, avocado, and came with a side and I chose the grits. Yummy. Apparently a popular option is their Avocado Benny, which is basically a sliced avocado with egg inside. I almost went with this because it sounds super yummy, but it had Cajun spices which turned me away. Maybe on my next visit.

Their only downside is service is pretty slow. It was a Saturday and was pretty busy, but there were a few times when we were actively looking for our server. Other than that, a really tasty option!"}
{"text":"It is always good to see a business do it the right way and get rewarded for doing so. This restaurant does it the right way. My wife and I both had the Cobb Salad for lunch - it was excellent. 

This location has seen a couple of restaurants come and go - with good reason. They all had issues. Toast is showing that the location was not the issue - the issue was the product - as it usually is.

Very nice. I didn't give it 5 stars because at one point it was too noisy to actually talk across the table. That might just be a bi-product of their success (they were packed) but it is still an issue."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with this place.  The best breakfast in the area hands down.  French Toast is always amazing, Omelettes are great too.  Service is fast and friendly.  Even when there is a wait it moves fast. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Adorable place, we don't even try to come on weekends since you can wait for hours. We had the \"Bernie\" special, scrambled with capers, goat cheese and smoked salmon and my daughter loved it. I had Cali Benedict. Very good, not best ever but quite good. Nice ambiance, feels like grandmas house. We loved the grits.. Home fries are tasty but I'm not a fan of them so crispy."}
{"text":"Being new to Ballantyne my husband and I tried this place out this past weekend and we loved it! There was a short wait (15 minutes), but that's to be expected at any breakfast place on a weekend. The service was great and I love how there's not just 1 server and everyone helps. The food was delicious, those hash browns...PERFECT. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"For a while, I thought the problem with this place was the absurd \"everyone's your waiter so no one's your waiter\" policy, but really the main problem is the food. It's the sort of food you'd get at a wedding that claims to be open bar, but only serves white wine. It's as bland as the patrons, which I suppose makes sense. The restaurant must cater to WASPy palates; I wish there were some sign that would advertise the fact. Maybe a Jesus fish and Trump sign would be enough. Regardless, if you like flavor, seasoned food, diversity or anything remotely interesting, there are better places to spend your time and money.

To be specific, I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. It came out suspiciously quickly. I hate adding salt to food, but this needed it. Ironically, the place is called The Toastery, but the promised bread did not come out. The corn bread did come out first but was marginally edible. Even the apple butter was not very good and who doesn't love apple butter?

I guess the food is less boring than where most of the diners were going. I won't say where, but it was 8:30 am on Sunday and there were a whole bunch of pasty white men in polo shirts."}
{"text":"5-stars for the best basic breakfast around. Want a couple eggs, sausage, and hash browns? Go to toast. You're not going to find anything super fancy - in my book breakfast should be basic and predictable. Pancakes, French toast, sandwiches and egg combinations are all awesome!"}
{"text":"Basically empty at 7am, opening time on Wednesday. Daily special Southwest Scramble for $10.99. Good coffee; exceptionally quick service.
First time at this location, and Ballantyne breaks the Toast tradition of long lines and slow service. Food excellent as always. Northerners note that \"hash browns\" are really diced fried potatoes with some tasty spices. Even the toast is really good."}
{"text":"In my area this is the best. Still great even up against the best. I will go back and I recommend this to place to everyone. Relaxing chill cool place to get your food."}
{"text":"The coffee was one of the better tasting cups, for a restaurant, but it was spoiled with a thick streak of something dirty that was on the inside edge of the cup, and not revealed until almost half-way through the cup... maybe this was the flavor enhancer?

Ordered a dish that was supposed to be served with poached eggs... unfortunately those eggs were totally hard-cooked.  Huh?  The dish, itself, was also served cold, as was the french toast dish... the soft butter that was added at the table didn't even begin to melt, even slightly... Really?

The toast that was ordered, came out warm, but not even toasty.  Where did we lose the concept of toast?

The remake of the dish with the poached eggs, came out sarcastically undercooked, and it managed to come out cold, as well.

The manager apologized and when he asked if they could remake things (again) or get anything else, we declined.  He said he didn't want us to go hungry, and so we explained we would go elsewhere to eat.  Problem solved.

The manager also explained that their kitchen prides itself on serving dishes so quickly that they don't even have any heat lamps in the kitchen... well, might be a good idea to get some, since they cannot seem to carry any of it out and ensure it's hot.  Needless to say, we W---- B- B---...."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  It's always been on a weekday.  Never a wait, great food and service"}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast! Service was amazing, all staff are prepared to help you. Food was presented in a very timely manner."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous and right near my house. They're often crowded but don't let it scare you away. They're fast service will ensure that you have a seat in no time. The peanut butter and banana French toast will change your life forever."}
{"text":"I like this location. It's cute, they have a little bar and I've never waited long.  The food however isn't great and neither are the mimosas...it could be that I ordered the wrong things but nothing I've eaten here has been outstanding.  They serve these little corn cake muffins while you wait for your food which is awesome, but they weren't tasty.  The mimosas are pretty big but again, not tasty.  They weren't very bubbly and taste like they were made with old wine instead of sparkling wine.  I usually love corned beef hash and ask for it well done so the edges are a bit crispy... Not only was it not well done but they smothered it in hollandaise sauce.  I guess I should have read the menu closer.  They do have gluten free options which is nice and the service is always great which is what makes me come back.  Next time I'll just try pancakes"}
{"text":"Best sausage gravy in Charlotte hands down. Make sure you dip the potatos in it also. You will thank me later. Interesting wait staff, everyone is your waiter. Everything we have had there we have enjoyed. Good coffee, awesome corned beef hash. Been back twice since the first time . plus there's a small farmers market on Saturday and flowers are 10 dollars a bouquet amazing flowers and awesome sourdough bread. Go early!"}
{"text":"After the previous resident closed (thank goodness), we were excited to find that Toast was opening here.

The entry area is very small and is a bit nuts when busy, and for some reason the front door is super hard to open, and doesn't have a push/pull sticker, so they have a lot of issues with people not being able to get in or out easily.  

Once seated (at a small table right near the waiting area in front--not very desirable), we were greeted and served.  The service was good, but not great.  The menu is decent with a good many options, and the price point is good.  The food was good and served pretty quickly considering how busy it was.

Here is my issue.  To make it in this area with so many breakfast places, you HAVE to be extra good at something, or offer a menu that is different with some really stand-out items.  This had neither. Yes, the food was good and the space was fun, but there was nothing that made me say..hey!  This is my new breakfast spot.  It was just ok/average/good.   I was hoping for something like super service, or an unusual menu, or the food to be mouth-watering.  It lacked a bit in those areas.

I will go back and try a few more things, but they have got to step up their game if they will survive here in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Each dish disappeared nearly after it was cleared. The food was so so. I had the crab cakes Benedict and it wasn't bad, but it was very plain. Nothing special about it. The eggs were poached perfectly tho. The crab cakes did not have a lot of flavor, but there was a good amount of crab. The potatoes on the side were good, but nothing to write home about. I thought it was a tad expensive. But overall, a good experience. I was seated within 5 minutes despite the crowd on a Saturday morning. The service is what makes this place better than average."}
{"text":"We went here this morning for my birthday breakfast and it did not disappoint! Everyone in our party of 6 loved their food. We'll definitely be back when we're on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Yep, no thanks. Service was great, but the food was far from it. First time for my entire group and we definitely won't be back. I'll stick with Terrace Cafe' for my breakfast. Even iHop is better."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with this area then you know the prices will match. The breakfast is okay. Potato hash browns are chunky, seasoned nicely. Unfortunately, it is a very small serving. Eggs are just eggs. The small slab of ham I added was fine too. You will pay a pretty penny for a small plate of breakfast and a nice ambience. 

I'm told they are franchising soon. May be good for the business but quality of food and customer satisfaction may decline. It happens. However, I did appreciate the freshly brewed cup of Lavazza coffee. 

Yes, it's quality and staff are nice."}
{"text":"Wow!  New favorite.  Went for lunch on a Saturday and was throughly impressed!!  Very busy but easy to maneuver through and got seated right away.  I had the black bean burger wrap with avocado and pesto pasta salad- YUM YUM YUM!!!!!  Very fresh, flavorful and unique.  The service was top notch.  Several people would make sure our drinks were full at all times and would check on us frequently.  I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Our food was edible. I think they use a microwave for their eggs. My wife had an omelet and I could see no evidence that it had touched a skillet. I had the breakfast burrito and the eggs had the same microwave look and feel. Service was fine but the cook needs to be introduced to an omelet pan and skillet. I cook omelets frequently and the only way to get overcooked eggs without any fry marks is in the microwave. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cornbread taste good, but was cold, they should really warm it up before they serve it, it will sure gets a lot more points from me. Cornbeef hash was more hash than beef, I didn't like it too much. Crabcake was the best of all, fresh and good flavor, porch egg was good too, their hash was ok, it has a good seasoning, but again, it's cold. Overall it is a average meal for me. I don't mind going back, but definitely not in a rush."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous.  Great menu, great service (everyone who works there is available to help you with whatever you need), great food.  My friends brought me here while I was in town for a weekend. I had the goat cheese and herb omelet and asked for mushrooms in it.  It's a GREAT omelet and the addition of the shrooms helped balance out the significant amount of goat cheese.  The omelets come out perfectly as you can see in the various photos for this place. They make their own bread so....get some toast because it's damn good (note: an order is 1 slice not 2).  They also give you complimentary chunks of cornbread which I did not try but my wife really enjoyed it.  The cornbread comes with...apple sauce and we all thought that was weird.  We were expecting honey butter or something like that but whatevs, it's free and people like it.  

I would 100% return to this place as it was so delicious. Oh and the home fries are perfect with some soft pieces, some crunchy pieces and a lot of flavor.  
One teensy complaint is a 4 seat table is way too small for their large plates.  We did LOTS of shuffling of creamer, water glasses, sugar...everything."}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was great and friendly. We waited about 45 mins for our food BUT we found out this was due to some equipment malfunctioning in the kitchen, and they comped our whole check even though we never asked or said anything to our waiter about it. We were so surprised we both exclaimed, \"why??\" when he crumpled up our check, he said that normally the food takes 10 mins to come out, and apologized sincerely for the wait. With such great customer service and good food, we will  definitely be back despite the wait!"}
{"text":"This is good food but I don't love the ambiance. Food comes fast but I feel like they're just trying to get you out. Usually when I'm at brunch I'm trying to talk to people and feel bad holding up a table. This is good if you're with a spouse or someone you see often and don't mind waiting for a 20 minute dining experience."}
{"text":"If you're unsure... toast has more than toast, but oh boy does it do toast well.  And by toast, I mean toast in forms of the word toast... not so much just the traditional side dish for eggs.  But also French TOAST as well.

On this particular morning (brunch) we decided to try it out for the first time with our Yankee friend in tow.  Meaning she was from the north, not that she enjoyed a NY Baseball team.
Anyway, they were in the mood for some good food and a mimosa while I was curious how popular toast could be that they named a caf√© out of it.

It was a short wait to get seated (maybe 5 mins?), and then once seated service started very quickly with drinks.  As we waited the return of our drink orders we did the typical think of looking around the room to see what looked tasty.  And I couldn't take my eyes off this poor girls BLT (which I didn't get) but it looked so delicious.
For the record ma'am, I was eyeballing the stack of bacon on your blt when I was drooling.  In case there were any misconceptions there.

I skipped the drool inducing BLT for a more breakfast item of eggs, toast (duh!), bacon, and some hash browns.  

Now, I saw a complaint that the hash browns weren't what someone was expecting and that's true.  I was actually anticipating wafflehouse style hash browns as well.  Instead these are more country potato like.  Which are a bit more hearty, but very delicious!

The eggs were cooked to order and not over-seasoned, so you can dress them up yourself a bit of you'd like.  Tasty none the less.
The BACON was thick cut and cooked to perfection as well.  Very good and perfect complement to the dish!  (I can't imagine how great the BLT would have been!)
The toast was very good, and very interesting.  It was soft, delicious, and almost gummy - but not in a disgusting wet bread way.  It was weird to describe, but very tasty none the less.  I loved it as my side... especially with a bite of bacon.  (Again, making me want the BLT even more).

So, if you didn't notice, I WILL be back for that BLT.   Our brunch was delicious, and everyone was raving about it.  I can't wait to return and try even more!

You definitely have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late quick breakfast.food was very good and wait staff was quick and very helpful. This is a group type service, where all staff waits on everyone. Food came out quick and hot. I decided on a BLT,  a cup of cream of mushroom soup and hashbrowns. The BLT was very good. Bacon was cooked well and ratio of all parts were good. The soup was very good, definitely not a canned soup. Hashbrowns were made from red potatoes, different but very good. My husband had the mushroom burger. Was also very good, but it did come with mayo which was not listed on the menu. This would not have been a problem,  except he does not like mayo and would have asked for it to be left off. Overall we will return.  It's a great place for a brunch where everyone can find something to eat."}
{"text":"We went for brunch, the wait wasn't too bad, the food was good, but the noise level inside was unbearable. Music was extremely loud and the acoustics are very bad.  We could not eat our food fast enough, and had a bad headache by the time we got out of there. If we go back, we will sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Brought my young mentee to have lunch. French Toast stuffed with strawberries and cream cheese looked good.  Really was breakfast, lunch and dessert!   I stuck with side of bacon and roasted veggies that were great."}
{"text":"Out of town with family and wanted to try the local spot. We checked yelp for recommendations and saw that Famous Toastery got some good reviews. 

We got to the area and it was in a quaint spot. There was a lot of people waiting and even people waiting outside.  There was a great coffee station outside for people to get a shot of coffee while they wait. I thought it was a nice touch.

We waited about 25 minutes for our table and we were seated. The restaurant was hot, but I could be because of where we were seated.  The waitress came and took our drink order and welcome us to the restaurant. 

A waiter came  to take our food Order and answer menu questions. We ordered different things.   I ordered  the blueberry flapjack combo with bacon and scrambled eggs with goat cheese. 

My first flapjack was burnt on the bottom, but they quickly fixed it. The second batch was absolutely delicious. 

It was great to try a new place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast spot in the area and decided to give Famous Toastery a try. Upon arriving(Sunday around 11am), they were definitely very busy. We were told the wait time would be around 25 minutes which was cool, but it actually turned out to be more like an hr.

Once we finally did get seated, I must say their service is great. The motto \"Where every server is your server\" holds true as someone was checking on us every couple of minutes. For my order, I went with a sausage, cheddar, and tomato omelette and grits. The omelette was flavorful and cooked well. The grits were more along the lines of just standard greats. Others in my party raved about the stuffed french toast as well. I'll definitely be going back at a hopefully less crowded time next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Toast Cafe for the first time on a Sunday, the wait was about 15 minutes. I ordered the Southwest Scramble which was very good and fresh! The cornbread that comes to the table was not warm but still very tasty with the apple jam. The owner's son even brought a dessert to our table for our first time visit. I will definitely be a regular at Toast Cafe!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is rather cozy and doesn't feel like a typical chain, which is GREAT.  I ordered an egg white omelet with mushroom and spinach, grits and wheat toast.  It would be hard to mess this up and they didn't.  It was all very tasty and good.  Unfortunately, the service was not up to par.  It took ONE hour for the server to offer a refill on my tea and to check back with us.  The restaurant did not seem that busy.   My other observation was that Frank Sinatra was being piped in and was singing, \"Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\"  This was not exactly what I wanted to hear on October 9th.    Overall, a very average experience in a space that's got more potential."}
{"text":"This is probably my best places for breakfast or brunch food in the area. The waiting time to be seated was quick even during Sunday brunch hours. The food was prepared hot and fresh in a timely fashion. The meal portions are definitely sized appropriately for the reasonable price. I would absolutely visit here again and highly recommend this establishment to others."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Outstanding selection of great food coupled with attentive and energetic service.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Thirty-five minute wait must mean something's tasty here. Good thing they have free coffee outside while you wait. Nice touch.

I liked the atmosphere, like a southern hospitality cottage-type setting. It went well with the friendly service we were given by all of the servers there, since none are assigned to a specific table. They all work together to cater to all guests.

We came for breakfast, so I wanted the stuffed French toast. Not a fan of pb, so I asked if I could get a Nutella & banana one instead. Wasn't a problem at all. Cool. But then when my food came out, it didn't look like Nutella. It wasn't as dark. I tasted it, and turns out they do a Nutella + cream cheese mix. Disappointment. I tasted more cream cheese than Nutella. Meh.

3 out of 5 at our table ordered the corned beef hash. They picked the right thing. Definitely better than my french toast. Oh well."}
{"text":"The Cali Benedict was out of this world. The potatoes, sausage, and the coffee were also top notch. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. 

The only downside was that it was so busy for the Sunday brunch service, we had to wait about 20 minutes outside for a table. However, I will say  that once you've eaten here, it will become clear that it's busy for a good reason - the food is great."}
{"text":"I have to give a low rating not because of the food but the service. I consider I was a regular to this place. Until recently, I read other reviews it seems everyone was offered the corn bread when they placed the order. I was surprised, as I never had it during my past visits in years, not even ask whether I wanted it or not. 
This morning, I paid another visit. After I placed the order, I saw other tables were offered the corn bread as usual, and the table next to me even got an extra basket. Still no one even bother to ask me whether I want corn bread or not. Despite I usually paid 20% tips, this is the different treatment I received. I don't want to go with the \"D\" word, but if you have any other reasonable excuse, it is the time to share..."}
{"text":"Very pricey!!! Food is good. Management is odd/strange (I once saw the manager remove a slice of quiche from a to go container with his bare hands. Staff put the wrong type of quiche in the container and the manager was \"correcting\" the situation. He saw me watching him, got nervous, then put on gloves. Weird! Nasty.)"}
{"text":"It's hard to define what each person places on value, especially breakfast. Eggs, toast, potatoes and protein is the stable morning start for many of us. Certainly quality plays an important role, labor and overhead covers most of the rest. Famous Toastery served a good breakfast this morning. My bill was $12.23 including coffee. A similar breakfast costs $6/7 at three other Mom & Pop stores around town. With that said I also need to add that service was poor. My server came by three times, each time saying that he would be back right away with a coffee refill. The only way I got a second cup was by holding my cup up high to catch his attention."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch it was very busy which was no surprise there was adequate parking which was good all of the staff was friendly and attentive they all move very quickly also I ordered the avocado omelette with a flapjack on the side it was very tasty I willl be back"}
{"text":"Decided to try Toast Cafe for the first time.  I ordered the Egg's Benedict with hash browns and hubby ordered a western omellette with hash browns and toast.  If you mess up the hollandaise sauce, the whole breakfast is shot and this was definitely a terrible hollandaise sauce that was thin, runny and tasted off.  The hash brown portion was skimpy as well as greasy and tasted like they were reheated from another time.  Hubby's omellette was cold, but he did say it tasted good.  I'll give the servers 5 stars for friendliness.  I agree with other feedback that you definitely feel rushed to get out and free up the table.  The manager did stop us on the way out to ask how our meal went, but who wants to tell him the truth and make this breakfast experience even worse.  I would recommend having a questionnaire card on the table.  Would I go back there?  Doubt it."}
{"text":"Our family recently moved to Charlotte and have not ventured out much for brunch.  The overall atmosphere and experience were very nice.  The food was good and waitstaff very attentive.  It was very busy at 9:30 AM on a Sunday, but we were seated immediately.

We both ordered omelets and both were very good.  The fruit was very fresh and accoutrements well selected.  I will give them 4 stars and will revisit my review once we are able to visit more restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"What a menu! Fabulous food! Wonderful staff! Love i can get breakfast anytime! Highly recommended!!!!

Love the atmosphere and location! It's in the middle of everything, and right below my chiropractor. Super convenient!"}
{"text":"Good, solid breakfast/lunch place. Why not five stars? Price... it's a little spendy for breakfast and lunch. Another gripe: include the kids drink in the kids meal price.. my daughter's pancakes were 4.99 and her lemonade was 2.99. That's flat out ridiculous. Make it 5.99 and you are still making money.

Food is good, wonderfully presented. Whomever said their omelettes are \"huge\"... take a trip to Camellia Grille in New Orleans and then tell me if the omelettes at Toast are \"huge\". Toast's omelettes are reasonably sized and tasty. The side potatoes were very good. My only complaint was there wasn't enough.. and I don't mean they were skimpy (portion was fair), it's just that I wanted more!

EDIT: The restaurant was apparently bought out by the chain \"Famous Toastery\". With that buyout came an adjusted menu. One thing we noticed yesterday is the \"Combo\" - one pancake, one egg, bacon for 10.99 can be purchased a la carte for $2 less. The waiter said \"oh yeah, you caught that\". So, basically the Famous Toastery hopes you're an idiot and opt to pay $2 more for a \"combo\" than if you bought one pancake, one egg and an order of bacon a la carte.

Four stars just went down to two."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high walking in but It was just ok to me. First thing you should know is you don't have a set, single server here. All the employees kinda take care of all the tables. We had a waitress take our order and then no one came by for about 30 minutes until the food came out. In that time we had no refills on drinks and just sat there wondering where the waitress had went. Well she never came by again lol. We had others stop by to see if we needed anything after that but I just didn't expect that. 

My sister and I had ordered the creamsicle mimosa. It sounded amazing on the menu but we both were sadly disappointed. It tasted just like a creamy regular mimosa, mostly just cream and champagne. It needed more orange flavor. I squeezed an orange slice into it that came with the breakfast and then it tasted a little better. 

For my brunch entree I ordered the corned beef and hash. It came with two eggs and hollandaise sauce on top. Eggs were cooked perfectly how I wanted them. It had good flavor but the corned beef hash was more like corned beef bits (like bacon bits) instead of pieces. It was chopped so tiny that it was mostly the potato hash with a hint of corned beef. If it had bigger pieces it would have been delicious! My husband had an omelet which he liked but it was pretty standard. Now on the other hand my sister had ordered an \"avocado omelet\" and it literally had one little piece of avocado. They should have called it a tomato omelet, very stingy on avocado here. 

The bill for my husband and myself was $33 plus tip so we spent $40 on breakfast and it was just ok. Not bad food by any means, it was good, but I've had better for cheaper."}
{"text":"First time to come here for breakfast. Service is great. You are not just assigned 1 server. Everyone works as a team so you get service from just about anyone that works there. 

I ordered a western omelette and that comes with breakfast potato which they call it hash brown. So if you're looking for real hash browns you won't get that here. Also got a flap jack and wheat toast. All for $15. Which is a good deal for all that food. I won't have to eat again till dinner time. Lol. 

I will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Can't say enough positive things about Toast! It's a welcoming, happy breakfast/lunch spot with excellent food! Try the omelettes, French toast or lobster rolls (when in season). My family and I go here at least once a week. My husband is a HUGE omelette fan, and Toast never disappoints. My son loves their french toast, and I've heard from more than one person that this is their favorite french toast in town. The bloody marys are spicy with plenty of fresh horseradish. I am not big on breakfast (can't eat eggs) so I usually order from the lunch menu. I love their sandwiches and salads. Everything tastes like it was cooked in your mom's kitchen and delivered to your table with love. Toast Caf√© is the perfect spot for a sunny breakfast meeting, family outing, business lunch and any other occasion where you are looking for  consistently good comfort food with no fuss."}
{"text":"This place is good! We went during brunch and were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes. We were seated immediately! They give you complimentary cornbread and apple butter. My friends loved it! 

I ordered the build your own omelet with avocado, spinach , bacon and brie. The omelet price includes 3 options and each additional option is 75 cents. My omelet was HUGEEEE. It was stuffed to capacity.  Idk how I got they got the omelet so full. The omelet comes with potatoes or grits & toast. You definitely get your money's worth.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love Toast! Everyone is your server, so there's always amazing service! And the food is consistently delicious and semi-heathy. Great place to come for either breakfast or brunch. I'm only taking a star off, because you need to pay attention to what you order. I come here every other week, and twice now they've forgot the avocado in my avocado omelet. I know it's usually very busy, so I try to be patient but when an ingredient's in the name, make sure to include that ingredient! Other than that, I love it and will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Charlotte.
The blueberry flapjacks are special here. Once in a while they are so well made that I don't even need maple syrup : Seasonal blueberries I guess.
They serve a good variety of omelets as well. The northwestern with goat cheese and herbs is my default order (can't go wrong with goat cheese).
They have a Lavazza coffee machine so cappuccino is authentic and strong, like it should be.
Weekdays are best to go when tables are easy to get. Weekends can be crazy with a horde of people waiting outside and the place is jam packed. Free coffee for the patrons braving the elements makes it worth the while."}
{"text":"Toast is one of my go-to places on days when I need a good breakfast! The staff is always super friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"An amazing breakfast every time. I love that there are so many healthy choices and I love the turkey bacon."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place after eagerly awaiting the replacement for the awful Cafe Really.  I had high hopes after hearing good reviews from neighbours.

Toast fell below my expectations.  I ordered the corned beef hash after the waiter recommended it.  I don't want to say it was out of a can, but it tasted like it.  Corned beef hash is hit and miss usually, so my I didn't have high hopes.  I ordered my eggs over-medium (they advertize that they only use pasteurized eggs) but they came out over-easy.  The hollandaise sauce was not great either.  It looked like my plate had been sitting a few minutes before it came out.  

The wheat toast I ordered was pretty good.  Coffee was good.

Others in my party ordered an omelet.  They thought it was good.  I tasted it and thought it was so-so.  The crepes were too sweet for the person that ordered them, but I didn't try them myself.  We also ordered a la carte bacon and pancakes.  Both were good.

This brings me to one disappointing aspect of the restaurant.  Everything is a la carte.  So my breakfast cost me $9 for the hash, $2 for coffee, and $1 for toast.  I felt this was too much for what I got and the way it was prepared.  As another poster mentioned, the portion was pretty small. 

Service was really good.  Every staffer was friendly and helpful.  Water and coffee refilled often.  Staff are why I will try the place again.  I will also order something else and give it another shot, maybe at lunch too.

I really want this place to succeed.  The little plaza needs them there.  I hope the owners increase food quality and portion, and watch what they charge."}
{"text":"I've been to Toast Ballantyne five or six times.  The food is okay; one time my potato hash browns had a piece of black netting cooked into it, but my server apologized and I didn't hold it against them (I've been back a few more times since that incident).  However, their hostess this weekend 3/14/2015, was a very unpleasant individual.  My party (a group of 5) arrived and were told it would be a 15 minute wait for breakfast (we arrived to the hostess stand around 10:50 am).  All the other groups that arrived to put their names in the same time as me were told the same approximate wait time.  After waiting about 30 minutes, I observed that all the other people who arrived at the same time as me were already seated and people who had arrived much later than my party were now being seated.  I asked the hostess again, how much longer until we would be seated (without looking to see where were on the list), told me a little while.  After 40 minutes (11:30), I asked again, and was told if my group of 5 wanted to squeeze at a table for 4 we could be seated \"when that table is done\" the hostess said pointing at a table that was still eating.  By this point, I had watched several groups of 4 that had arrived much later than my group, get seated (at 4-top tables) and was very insulted that after waiting so long we were now going to have to squeeze into a table too small for us (that we should have been offered before all those other groups.  When I asked the hostess, if we were going to be squeezed at a 4-top, when did she seat others before us, she tried to lie and tell me \"no we are going down the list in order.\"  I could see that was not the case by looking at the list (and seeing multiple names crossed off the list under my name) and by standing there for 40 minutes and observing people coming in, waiting, and being seated.  Meanwhile, as new people came in to put their names down, she was still telling them a 15-20 minute wait.  I find that hard to believe when I had already waited 40 minutes.  

I understand the weekends are busy.  I was more than happy to wait to get seated (especially the 15 minute wait I was told).  But I don't appreciated being ignored by the hostess, brushed off when asking how much longer (after 30 minutes of waiting) and watching other groups come in, but their names on the wait list, and get seated.  Then, after a 40 minute wait, to get offered a 4-top table that other people were still seated at and eating (and told it would be a few more minutes).  An apology by the hostess for the delay, or for skipping over us, would have been nice.  Instead the condescending way she addressed me and offered me a table (that people were still seated at and eating) after a 40 minute wait was too much.  I will never go back to Toast.  I will never recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Free Coffee while you wait. Not a lot of seating, but great breakfast food. Blueberry stuffed French toast is amazing.  Ask for bacon crunchy bc they tend to undercook it."}
{"text":"My gluten free toast was burnt, not just burnt but charred. No idea how they missed that. The avocado omelet was cold and the filling was in a big glob in the center. The cheese wasn't even melted. The breakfast potatoes were cold and hard around the edges, but had good flavor so I imagine they're pleasant when warm. We were charged for three large orange juices when we only got two. After asking the cashier to fix it, she did not. I noticed but I just paid for it anyway because I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Disliked the team server setup, reduced accountability. The Toastery was overpriced, paid almost $50 for breakfast for two adults and one child. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I eat here regularly. The food is very good, and I feel it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The tables wobbled, and the staff dived in all dirty dishes.  
            The table that my family and I sat at had major leveling problems. I tried to remedy with the sugar packs, but to no avail.
        Front of house staff bussed tables with all fingers  in glasses, which is a major germ spreading process. I hope they have a large budget for hand soap, or someone will get sick certainly soon from suck terrible busing habits. 
       We were giving the bill as our food arrived, and then the attentiveness of our server was missing in action. I had to get up for coffee refill and napkins. I had to also flag a another server for a fork. 
       The highlight of the meal, was my wife's burger,  which she loved. It did however fall apart as she ate it, but it was wells seasoned and good quality. The kids liked their Mac and cheese, and the kids menu with activities was a nice touch for keeping the little ones occupied.
       I think if Toast would readjust their serving etiquette and busing processes to be more in line with proper service standards, I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Quote time to get sat was 25 mins. We saw a few chairs available at the bar area and decided to sit there instead. Bar area is small. I think it sits approx 5 people. Service was great. 

We each got an omelette. Omelettes were huge. I got a side of salsa with it and it was delicious. I got the western omelette and it had ham, onions and green peppers and cheese. Everything was good but the onions and peppers were huge. I also had a lot of peppers in my omelette. I got cinnamon raisin toast and put a slather of butter on it and it was good. 

They do serve you cornbread at the beginning of the meal. I'm not a fan of cornbread so I didn't try it but my friend and fianc√© did and said it was good but they wished it was served warm. They said it was cold. 

My fianc√© got a Bloody Mary and loved it. My friend got the mimosa and said they put in just the right amount of orange juice in it. 

Overall, we would all definitely go back again. My only complaint is that I had my purse hanging on my chair and someone that walked by (possibly a food runner or server) spilled coffee on my purse without telling me! When I got to my car I saw a huge coffee stain on it. I wish they would of just told me or offered a wet towel to help me clean it up."}
{"text":"Always a great option! Love the breakfast items & ability to order breakfast anytime. Best coffee around. We've always had great service as well."}
{"text":"Came here on New Years Day and wow, it was exactly what I needed. My friends and I ordered mimosas and Bloody Marys, they were perfect. If you want your Bloody Mary spicy, you have to ask or just add hot sauce yourself. I got the Breakfast burrito and biscuits with gravy. Probably, best biscuits study gravy I've ever had. It's just so good, you just keep wanting more of it.

I would give this place 5 stars but the service was off. I was not sure who was my waiter/waitress. Whenever I got that figured out, my waitress seemed tired or something because she did not interact with us at all.  I wanted to order another Bloody Mary but she was never around to check on us so I went up to the bar to order one. A gentlemen told me I had to order from my waitress.....problem...she never checks on our table. I do know the waitress's name but she needs to cheer up. 

I love this place and would recommend it to anyone, hopefully you won't have the same waitress I did."}
{"text":"This was my third and probably last time to Toast, I was severely not impressed.  On a positive note, the food was \"OKAY\". I had the French Toast combo with the peanut butter and banana stuffed French toast which was average.. Nothing out of this world, but okay.  Their coffee is amazing,  which I liked. Now on to the negative,  the service was awful!! My server approached our table with a terrible attitude.  I asked him what he recommended from their menu and he provided no positive input. We basically ordered whatever we thought sounded good. Then,  my girlfriend and I politely asked for our basket of corn bread in which he quickly forgot and never came back to our table until our breakfast was served. We had to remind him and that's when he came back with it.  After that he never came back around to see if we were okay.  I flagged him down for our check and a refill on my coffee; and ONCE AGAIN he forgot. I had to ask a second employee for a refill since my own server never came back to my table.  

My girlfriend and I left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouth from the bad service we received. Let's just say,  it's definitely NOT worth it unless you're looking for good coffee... And good luck trying to get a refill!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The food was well prepared and everyone was friendly and inviting! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying the Boy and I have been trying to find a new \"regular\" breakfast place, since we've just moved to the area.  

This past Saturday we tried Toast as it was the next in our \"Breakfast Places\" list.  

We got there and it was bit crowded, about a 10-15 minute wait for our party of two.  If you are anything other than a party of two, I would suggest you get there early.  

We were seated and handed menus and our drink order was taken.  They must use a \"team service\" style model as the person who brought us our coffee was not the same person who took our food order, nor was that the same person who came to check on us later, but they were all friendly, and I didn't feel rushed.  

We both ordered coffees and we were graciously given a basket of corn bread with apple butter.  The cornbread was good, the apple butter was good.  The apple butter ON the cornbread, not so good, but there was butter on the table so I didn't even have to ask for it.  

I got an Avocado Omlette with home fries and rye toast.  The Boy got Spinach Quiche with fresh fruit and grits.  

The omlette was good but it was huge.  It must ahve been a three egg omlette, I could only eat half.  The homefries were good, just what I was expecting.  The toast was toast.  It's hard to mess it up.  

The Boy's quiche was the best quiche I had ever tasted.  It had spinach, feta, and olives.  It was AMAZING.  The grits were really good.  They had a coarser texture than some of the other grits we've had and really had a corn flavor.  

All in all, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The human toast waving at me on the corner of Rea Road and Williams Pond Road lured me in during lunch time and boy am I glad he/she did. A friend and I went during our lunch break an we were immediately greeted by a smiling host who allowed us to choose where we wanted to sit. As we sat down within seconds our waiter came and took our drink order and provided us with menus. My friend and I took one look at the specials menu for the day and knew instantly what we wanted. She ordered the chicken salad with strawberries, pears, almonds, brie, and other goodies and I ordered the crab salad rolls. The food was so delicious we hardly spoke. After our meal ended we were paid a visit by the manager who asked how our meal was. Our response, \"fantastic!\". 

I'd like to come back with my family and try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service even during busy hours such as Sunday brunch. The wait is never ridiculous thanks to efficient staff who manage to flip tables quickly. The omelettes and benedicts are always great. The cocktails are also to die for."}
{"text":"This is placed is packed on weekends but the service is quick, the food prepared quickly and delicious too. I rarely eat breakfast out but I'd come back to this place if I didn't feel like cooking. French toast is awesome and the biscuits yummy."}
{"text":"Have never been let down! Their red velvet waffles are a must try!! it is slightly pricey though!"}
{"text":"This place is good! The service is impeccable and the food is delicious and quick. I really enjoy their breakfast menu, I haven't had lunch there yet but I hope to soon. The only drawback is it is on the expensive side for a place that serves your typical fare at high quality. All in all, I am a fan."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Their motto is every waiter is your waiter. Food is good. Service excellent."}
{"text":"We've been going to FT for brunch for a couple of years, and the food has *generally* been pretty good. 

The last two trips have been disappointing. On our most recent visit, on a weekday, my wife ordered the western BLT, and got a different sandwich. I ordered the Florentine Benedict the last two visits. I ordered it a second time in hopes that the first was an unusual occurrence. Nope. Same both times. The eggs were hard poached instead of oozing. I don't know what the sauce was, but it wasn't Hollandaise--not even a hint of lemon. 

As I said, the food at FT is generally pretty good, but until they get a chef who knows how to poach an egg and make a decent Hollandaise, I'd avoid the Benedicts. They're just awful.

FT tried to make it right by cutting the check in half, but all that meant was we paid half price for unacceptable food. We reduced the tip because our waiter didn't check in even once after we were served. 

So disappointing, considering how good the place has been in the past."}
{"text":"Delish! I had the Cali Benny egg specialty, was seasoned perfected and the poached eggs hit the spot. The strawberries and cream French toast is AMAZING. Will be coming here more often. Service was quick and precise."}
{"text":"Four star breakfast / traditional and modern American meals with flair - Cali Benedict is fresh and cool thanks to the avocados and tomatoes - they customized it to my taste and were very accommodating. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you really want to have a great breakfast,brunch or lunch you'll not find a better place to dine than TOAST.
The choices are endless and whatever you decide upon will be a winner
The service cannot be beat. Food comes out hot ,if that's what's required or chilled if it's to be cold.
The staff is marvelous and everyone pitches in to make your experience wonderful.
Brian and Patrick Burchill know what it takes to make a restaurant successful and it shows from the managers,servers and busing staff. The staff truly seems happy to be part of this winning team."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went this morning after viewing many good reviews. The menu was confusing as to what \"side items\" goes with what. The flapjacks were good. This can be my second choice for the flapjacks. The first is still The Original Pancake House. We ordered western omelet which was boring. And it looks like they cook the ingredients separate then throw it together. The eggs are cooked and after that their throw the rest of the ingredients inside and slice of plain american cheese inside, which was barely melted. The house coffee was just ok. However, the service was very good. if we come back it will be for the flapjacks."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location en route to a doctors appointment in the Pineville area. I was in search for vegan breakfast options and there were certainly slim pickings in the area. I love famous toastery but hadn't been since adopting a vegan diet. I perused the menu and figured I could probably finagle a vegan breakfast. 

I ordered the fruit cup, bagel with peanut butter and the potatoes without butter.  Everything turned out really good. I was especially surprised by the potatoes. It wasn't their typical potato perfection. But they were delicious nonetheless especially considering that this is an off-the-cuff vegan work-around.  The fruit cup was delicious and fresh as always.  My least favorite thing was the bagel not because of the flavor but because of the thickness. It was definitely a \"roll with a hole\" but the thinner half was a perfect conduit for the peanut butter. 

All in all a good clutch vegan meal and would probably work if I had to come here with family or friends for breakfast.  They still hold the title as one of my top breakfast spots in Charlotte.

The only reason this location didn't get the five stars that university location did (see my review) is because my server was a bit short and gruff. He wasn't altogether horrible, just not the best.  Even still, when I have my appointments on this side of town I will definitely stop in for breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars for years (before and after baby) and loved this place. Recently the service (mostly the kitchen speed) has tanked. We've switched our morning routine to other businesses. If you can't give me good service and speed, then it's not work paying you extra for breakfast. Hope they turn it it around."}
{"text":"Toast has - hands down - the best grits I have ever had.  I go there every chance I get for breakfast just to experience them!  Yes, the rest of the food is great and the service is good...but it is the grits that draw me in.  My favorite thing to have with my grits is the greek omelet...but the french toast is also good.  It is on the expensive side, but well worth it for a low key, no stress, great breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Top notch place for breakfast!  People and service are outstanding as well.  Have been on a smaller portion deit for several years so the serving was three times what I should eat.  It was so good I cleaned my plate and skipped lunch. Even had Rye Bread toast."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for brunch. They have breakfast & lunch menu, as well as brunch specials.  My husband got the French toast and he loved it.  I got the Tuna salad (add cucumber) and pasta salad side...u must say the food is very fresh.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is spot on and the food is always yummy. Best thing is they have gluten free pancakes if your kid is allergic like mine. I wish the corn muffins were gluten free, my kid would love them."}
{"text":"I have to admit being slightly disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. My wife had the crab salad special with grits. They brought her grits first, then brought another bowl with the meal. They were quite plane and ordinary, nothing special. They did take her dish back and bring the cucumber salad which was ok. The crab salad didn't really taste of crab but had an overpowering flavour despite a good amount of crab in it. She said the roll tasted better than the crab. 

I had the classic eggs Benedict. They have many so I tried the original to compare with other places I've tried. The hollandaise was bland, the eggs undercooked with runny whites. It came with a side of fried potatoes which had their skins on and were delicious with good seasoning and a great fried texture. Oddly enough the coffee was both weak and bitter. Not quite as bad as Cracker Barrel, but not that great either. 

Overall, not really worth $40 and I doubt I'd be back."}
{"text":"Toast in Ballantyne satisfied my brunch craving while I was in town for the Thanksgiving holiday. Joe and I are spoiled and do brunch at least every other weekend and for the options available to us, I certainly feel that Toast is better than what we could have done. Toast had some creative menu items but not enough oomph to really be great."}
{"text":"It was alright, I've only ever been to this location but would love to try the Ballantyne location.  The breakfast isn't that good if you ask me, the ambience is good but you could get a better breakfast with more variety elsewhere. I got the crab cakes with hollandaise sauce and they were not very good. I'd take Terrace Cafe over this place any day."}
{"text":"Their pancakes and stuffed French toast are really good.  if you go on Sunday for brunch, they also serve you corn bread with apple jelly."}
{"text":"We went here for Father's Day brunch and there was a 45 minute wait at 930AM (not entirely surprising). When we were seated, our experience was good! The wait staff seemed a bit stressed (& hot & sweaty, noticeably), but very nice. The complimentary cornbread they brought to the table was good, & our meals came out fairly quickly. Great California Benedict, super tasty. The only negatives were the wait & feeling a bit rushed as there were so many people waiting...that, & maybe consider slightly bigger tables! With all the condiments and additional bowls, plates & general 'stuff' that comes along with breakfast, we were spilling over w/ almost no room for our main plates. Otherwise, good food! Will return, though likely not for a Sunday or holiday brunch."}
{"text":"Great bacon is always the test of a breakfast place. Missing Skillet's, but Toast fills the niche nicely."}
{"text":"This place was way below what I expected due to the restaurant service and overall experience. I will give it to the fact that they either had turnover in management or just highly ineffective service. The restaurant was half full and we (2 people) had to wait 15 minutes to sit down. It was like no one was communicating to other people that tables were done and get them ready to serve.

Nevertheless, after ordering we had to wait even more!! We even over heard the waiters apologizing to another table that sat down before us about the wait in food. In total what should be an hour max brunch/lunch turned into two hours with all the waiting. 

So I must talk about the food as well. It was sub-par at best. I got the breakfast bowl and it was bland and slightly soggy. I am not a professional cook and my food taste so much better! I am in no rush to ever go back and I highly recommend other places for your brunch/lunch. 

This is shocking for me to even say because the other location in Dilworth is so much better! I can't apologize for being to harsh when it was below okay."}

What a wonderful place!!  This is something that Ballantyne needs a little bit more of.  We are lacking good breakfast spots.  What makes Toast so unique is their menu and service.  It's not just the typical greasy breakfast spot that rushes you in and out.  You have healthy options if you need them and some extremely delicious dessert'ish breakfast choices.  Like numerous stuffed french toast options and omelettes galore!!  The tomato avocado cheese omelette was superb.  Big and fluffy with all fresh ingredients.  The wife and I will definitely be back and will probably bring some friends.  

Enjoy!

{"text":"Food was ok. Been here twice. Today we ordered the avocado omelette (as recommended by the server) and there was not much avocado in there... but there was a lot of bacon! My husband would have loved the bacon! The coffee was warm, not hot.  The service was fine. Not one of my top places."}
{"text":"Dined here for the second time. There are positives and negatives to this place. The positives are from meals that weren't mine. I've tasted their quiche and French toast, both of which are awesome. My two meals were underwhelming. I was excited to see corned beef hash and that's something I'll always order when available. The disappointment was that I struggled to locate much meat in my potatoes. It was probably a 10% corned beef to 90% potato ratio. Today I ordered the Left Coast BLT. Everything on the sandwich was great but for such a large sandwich, I had only three pieces of bacon... On a BLT! I had to combine the ingredients from both halves of the sandwich to make one decent sized \"half sandwich\". It appears the folks at this place are extremely stingy on the meats. I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for Sunday brunch. It's always fantastic and service is prompt and with a smile. They are always switching up the menu with new and fresh specials."}
{"text":"I ordered french combo from the griddle section that came with french toast(or choice of pancake), scrambled egg(any egg style) and sausage(or choice of bacon). This is my first time and my expectation might be high. The food was mediocre. The portion of scrambled egg was not enough for me and french toast was not that thick and moist. For the price, it was just okay."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! Staff are friendly and not invasive at all. Their flapjacks and French toast are the best I've had in Charlotte! Definitely come here for brunch."}
{"text":"Overrated. Not bad by any means. But also no different than any other breakfast place I've ever been to. Espresso is good, but the coffee sucks. Place always has ridiculous waits and it's expensive for breakfast. Might as well go to ihop."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, and the service was excellent.  Our coffee cup was never empty, the food came out promptly!  My friend and I both had the Eggs Benedict.  The waiter asked how we wanted our eggs poached--probably the best Eggs Benedict I've had in a while.  The eggs were poached perfectly, the whites weren't runny, and the yolks, liquid gold!  Warm eggs yolks with the hollandaise sauce-nothing better.  You don't have just one server, but a team, anyone on their or in the area, made sure things were good.  They cleared plates fast, just attention to detail.  There were so many items on the menu--I can wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A good variety of things to eat. The lobster Benedict for Sunday brunch was amazing. Love how the inside is decorated like a farm house"}
{"text":"Really like the corn bread here. The variety of choices is also very nice. I ordered the avocado omelet and my bf ordered the country benedict. We also have the roasted vegetables on the side. Both taste delicious. The service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Toast.  I like the one in Dilworth, the one in Davidson and this one at Ballantyne.  I have had some things that left me disappointed but 9 times out of 10 I leave full, satisfied and NOT broke.  

One of my favorite dishes is the peanut butter/banana french toast.  I mean, can you go wrong with that combination?  I also love their breakfast burritos and their scrambler skillets.  The one I tried this past weekend had jalapenos, cheese, and chorizo.  It was delicious.  I am also typically a fan their \"specials.\"  They have very good crepes, specialty pancakes, quiches, etc.  They offer a wide variety of breakfast/brunch/lunch items and they are typically pretty scrumptious.

The service is good and personal.  The owner of Ballantyne and Park road locations is a very nice guy that seemed to recognize us after only meeting us one time.  Our most recent visit to the Ballantyne location we met the owner's brother who is apparently the new manager.  He was VERY friendly and seemed genuinely interested in his customers.  I really like these fellas and their food.  That's all.  goodbye."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good but my goodness is this place expensive.  I can get as good of food and even better service at Victoria's in Clover SC for half the price."}
{"text":"So, I have only previously been to the Toast location in Dilworth.  So, after Mass this past Sunday my Mom actually decided that we could give a new place a shot, crazy since we always end up at the same place. I was excited.  On our way there I called ahead and was able to put our name in, which is a definite bonus.  I was given a 25 minute wait time so we only had to wait about 10 minutes once we arrived and I let them know we were there.
Once we were seated the confusion began.  We seemed to have three people waiting on us, asking the same questions. Finally I had to tell one of them we have already given our drink orders.  We were also seated by a door on the side of the restaurant, which servers and the Manager were running in and out of so the cold kept coming in. Not pleasant at all. The party next to us actually requested to be moved, but we held out since there would have been a long wait for another table.
My Mom order the crepe special which she loved.  However, she could not touch her Bloody Mary as it was a cup of horseradish. I had it send back and she ordered a mimosa which she was much happier with.
I chose the MBS, mushroom, bacon, and swiss omelette and added peppers and onions. The mushrooms seemed like they were overcooked, very soggy! Or, maybe out of a can? And, the peppers and onions were not cooked at all. 
Overall it was just okay. But, as I think I feel about the other location, rushed service, confusion, and okay food, it applies here as well."}
{"text":"Amazing service! And great food, strongly recommend the avocado benny and the banana peanut butter French toast."}
{"text":"I have tried the toaster twice the service was fantastic but the food was just ok. I came once for lunch and once for breakfast and both time I left slightly disappointed.  Especially considering the long weekend wait."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. I treat me and mom to brunch here. Flavors are amazing! French toast to die for perfect amount of fluffiness and crispy too. Not overly sweet but just perfect with the maple syrup that tastes like the real deal. I had a basic egg combo plate and loved the sides bacon was nice and thick. All very reasonable for the pice (@10 or under) . Left so happy and full. You can tell they put care into the foods to produce such fresh flavors!"}
{"text":"Nice wait staff. Busy place. Food is ok. My wife ordered an omelet with eggs whites and she got regular eggs. Had to send it back. The second time around the potatoes that came with the omelet were missing."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!
We had lobster Benedict with a dill hollandaise 
The SMB omelet with egg whites, pumpkin pancakes and a turkey Ruben
Everything was delicious!! Service is great, food came out very fast and nice and hot!
We will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Corned beef hash was great. Not all greasy like some places. I'm not a fan of hollandaise Sauce so I left it off and I will get it again and again. If you look at the picture you can tell how much I liked it."}
{"text":"We went to Toast today for a very late breakfast.  The place was packed but we didn't need to wait for a table.  We both had omelets; my husband had the Western and I had The Usual-filled with apple sausage and huge chunks of grilled onions that tasted like they had been pre-saut√©ed prior together and a bit of cheddar (I think). I'm not a huge fan of a lot of cheese with my eggs so that was a good thing.  After ordering it felt like only 5 minutes had passed before our plates were ready.  
 
While the food was very good, I'm giving 5 stars for the service which was outstanding from the minute we walked in until we left. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there.  They were very attentive but not in that annoying stalking sort of way. And for that reason, I will be back. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Usually, one of my favorites places for Brunch on Sunday. The service and food is usually great. HOWEVER, on 8/16, very disappointed. Second weekend in a row for us they ran out of my wifes order. 15 mins AFTER we ordered, waitress told us they were out of the Spinach Quiche on the brunch menu. How did she not know it was running low when we orderd? She then said \" we should be there by 10 am or it'll run out\".   I thought it was a BRUNCH, not breakfast menu. So then she ordered egg breakfast with biscuit. They delivered the eggs, then said they were out of biscuits. The waitress later came by to see how things were, and when we told her they were also out of her biscuit, she gave a little laugh, and just left?!?  Never did a manager come by so I guess she didnt bother telling anyone. I worked in restaurants for years during college and its all about communication from the kitchen, and attention to the details, from open to close. Either they didnt tell her what was running low, or she didnt hear them. Let us know before we order!. My potatoes were cold, the toast was bone cold, no butter on it or delivered...just the little things add up to a disappointing experience, again.
We'll try again , hopefully, they pay attention to the details until 3 pm next time."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a little while back and greatly enjoyed it. The omelette was delicious, the sides were delicious as well, the service is good and the atmosphere is relaxed. I have to take one star off for the prices though; they seem rather high for the amount of food you get but despite that I'll be back for sure."}
