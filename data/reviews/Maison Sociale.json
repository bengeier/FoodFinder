{"text":"Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience here. We went in for brunch, I got the peach lemonade with rum which was delicious.   The hiccup is that we were never served after. At. All. The staff seemed way more interested in their conversation and completely forgot about us.   I  paid for my VERY expensive cocktail (12$!) and went somewhere else.   Will try again one day and hopefully, it'll be better..."}
{"text":"From the start, I have to say I didn't try the food. We wanted to get brunch on Saturday at 1:30pm and were told that because of their bar license, kids are not allowed in there. Too bad, because my kid is always with me. Nice looking place, though!"}
{"text":"OK so it pains me to do this - essentially drop these guys down from four stars to one, but that's just the way it is.   When they initially opened, their concept was great; they had a great cocktail menu, they were open during the day, they were doing brunch, and the music was kick-ass. Then they decided to close during the day - which I can understand if being open wasn't profitable, but considering so much thought went into designing the space to include outlets and what-not for laptops, so that people could work while they were there, you'd think they would have done some kind of market research to see if this would actually work in the neighborhood they were in. But I digress. My beef is with my recent visit, when a friend and I just felt like a drink on a Saturday night. What a major letdown.  First, we walked in and were barely acknowledged by the two kids that were there.  We grabbed a table and waited for service. The guy comes over and asks us what we want.   Me: Well, can I see the drinks menu?   Him: We don't have one.   Me: What do you mean you don't have one?   Him: We don't have one.   Me: Well you used to have one.   Him: We don't have one anymore.   Me: ..... [patience wearing thin - stupid people really annoy the hell out of me].  Me: Can we get two Pimms then? (Note that this was on their original menu).  Him: What's that?  Me: Are you kidding me right now? (I turn to my friend and agitatedly tell her that all I wanted was one damn drink).  Him: I don't think we have that, (then he turns to ask the other kid if they have Pimms, and the guy responds in typical über hipster wannabe fashion \"Um, NO, We don't have that!\").  [Intermission: my friend and I look at each other and I ask 'what the f**k is this?']  Him: We have the standard drinks.   Me: Like?  Him: We have old-fashioned.  Me: Do you have wine?  Him: No.  Me: I'm leaving.  Don't waste your time - the place had a lot of potential but I'm sad to report that it's pretty much done with that."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday May 17th, and was looking forward to a great meal after hearing great reviews of this place, and seeing all the wonderful food pictures.  Was greeted by the waiter upon entering and given a menu.  From there on, we were pretty much ignored the whole time.  Made several attemps to get the waiters attention.  Received a peace sign from him as he was at the bar talking to another waiter (I interpreted this as I will be there in two minutes kind of thing).  He never returned.  We were waiting (starving) for about 20 minutes, before we decided to head around the corner to a place on St-Viater street.  Upon walking out the waiter was not even apologetic or seemed to care we were leaving.  The restaurant was not busy (only about 3-4 other clients).  I think the priority was only in serving drinks, since there were 3 other staff behind the bar (to serve 5 clients including us).  I liked the ambiance of this place, and the menu offerings, that looked very tempting.  I would maybe recommend trying this place for drinks at night and see if it is any better, but for a meal I would check around elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Ok.  So our group of about 10 guys stopped here while barhopping recently.  We thought \"hey.  This place looks like they  have drinks and food.  Let's give it ago.\"  Disappointment.  Our waiter informed us that they were only serving raw dishes - tartare, sushi, etc.  We wanted and expected something more substantial.  But that's ok.  Let's just get a round of drinks and head out.  So we order drinks.  They took forever.  It was several beers and a couple gin and tonics.  Not a complicated order.  We finally got our drinks and finished them a few minutes later.  And waited for our waiter to come back so we could ask for the check.  Well, eventually I just got up and went to the bar and paid.  We were ready to go.  Inattentive staff, a \"raw-only\" menu when there is clearly a larger menu advertised, and just a generally bleh atmosphere.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Place is great. Food is delicious.you should definitely come try new menu. Shredded beef with corn and beets was amazing. Salad with shrimp amazing. Salmon tartar with seaweed is very good. It's actually a lot of tasty dishes to try. I'm not big fan of this type of food, but I enjoy everything from New tasting menu. I feel like royalty. Waiters, bartender treet us , as we house special guests. Ps sorry for my English"}
{"text":"Service impeccable! Food very surprisingly (wasn't clear from menu) awesome. And ambiance and staff in characteristically for montreal's mile-end not stuck up! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the good fortune of stumbling upon Maison Sociale during a recent trip to Montreal. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was how nice the space is -- hip and modern, but warm and welcoming at the same time. There was a DJ playing good music, and my husband, the audiophile, was even impressed with the sound system.   We took a seat at the bar, but couldn't decide what to order. The bartender asked us what kind of liquor we like and then concocted two amazing tasting cocktails tailored just for us. Tried a few other cocktails throughout the night and those were just as delicious! Besides being great mixologists, the bartenders were all super cool, friendly and unpretentious; and the service was top-notch.   As the night went on, we also made friends with some nice locals who were hanging out as well. Had such a great time that we returned the following evening, our last in Montreal, and had an awesome night again! We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town and will have to try the food next time -- looked great!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken satay plate and big pint of Maine IPA at a party at Maison Sociale last night and I was really really happy with it. I ordered the chicken satay worried but resigned to the fact that I might be paying 7$ for a stick with a few pieces of chicken on it which I could then gnaw on like a hungry animal (which is what I was) at the bar. But instead it came off the stick, bigger pieces, on a plate with piles of fired basil and a delicious later of peanut sauce. If there had been even a small scoop of rice I'd be back to order that in a flash but as it was all the flavours were super delicate, perfectly cooked chicken, great snack, and great to see some of our neighbours in the states great microbrews popping up on menus. It's a beautiful funky room, and the waiters were funny, bilingual, and seemed genuinely interested in whether I liked what I'd ordered. They seemed a little overwhelmed and slowed down by the crush of people once the party got going, but I have faith they'll figure it out."}
{"text":"This place came recommended by a local food tour and I suggest they retract the recommendation. The menu offers a few random options, none very impressive. We also found the cocktail and wine list unimpressive.  To add to all this, the bartender actually laughed at me for mispronouncing a French word; the only time I've encountered such rudeness by Montréal servers. I'll be surprised if this place lasts."}
