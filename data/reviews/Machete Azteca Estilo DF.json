{"text":"Great place if you are looking for authentic D.F. style Mexican Food. This is their new location and they have another location inside the Mercado De Los Cielos at Desert Sky Mall. Their specialty are the Quesadillas, Huaraches and Barbacoa. They offer great service, great food and the Portions are INSANE!  If you order a Quesadilla or Huarache you are sure enough to be able to feed 2-3 people. Everything is made from scratch even the Tostadas! I personally don't like tostadas because they get soggy, but not here- The lady advised us that they are made in house and she was right they stay crisp till the end!  I have ordered the Barbacoa for events and it is the real deal. They give you all the fixings and prices are so cheap! Great hole in the wall if you are looking for something different from the typical Sonoran style food here in the Valley."}
{"text":"The menudo is SOOOO GOOD, almost  like how my grandma makes it. that's hard to beat. So definitely recommend this place 10/10 !"}

This is NOT your average Mexican Restaurant they have something different to offer.

This IS casual authentic style \"Mexican City Mexico\" style food.

This is NOT a fancy place. You are only here for the food.

The specialty of the house might be the namesake dish called the Machete.
The Machete is a house made corn tortilla that is SO LARGE it doesn't fit on a plate and is served on a PLATTER. The humungous tortilla comes in about a dozen varieties and comes stuffed with a thick blanket of mild melted cheese and arrives folded. Some of the varieties are seldom offered at most Mexican Restaurants in the valley like the squash blossoms and the huitacoche (Mexican Truffle also called Corn Smut that is considered a delicacy)

I had the Huitacoche Machete. At the time of this review it was only $7.99 so I didn't think it would be that large but it was enough to feed 2-3 people and I had to take half home after sharing some. It was very tasty, very good and generously filled. The Huitacoche was a more sweet, more textured kind less earthy kind than I ate in Mexico. It was mixed with sweet corn and was very interesting. 

I also had a Chicken Taco ($1.75) I knew it would be street sized because of the price. I liked that the house made double tortillas were hot and steamy and tasted just like the fresh ones from the tortilla factory in Mexico. The taco differed in flavor from a Jalisco Style Taco. It was a much milder tasting taco.

Three sauces were offered to most people in the restaurant with the dishes but due to how busy they were we only got to try one sauce that had a little kick to it and it helped the taco out.

My husband had the Huaraches with Chorizo. It was a giant platter that looked similar in size to the Machete but served open face and also came with lots of melty mild cheese.

I warn you that the menu is written in Spanish but it's pretty easy to figure out what is what because of the pictures on the menu.

On out visit the atmosphere was extremely loud. Mexican Music is blaring outside the building and inside is Mexican Television blaring and you hear both at the same time.

On our visit they were very busy with non stop take out orders and every booth was filled with customers. Considering how busy they were I thought the service was very efficient and friendlier than I was expecting.

This place should be on your bucket list if you like interesting food.

I recommend ordering a Machete or a Huarache.

Parking is easy they have their own large lot."}
{"text":"I went to their 75th ave location. I couldn't find it on the yelp but I went there today with my co worker and ordered some quesadillas. I heard a lot of good stuff about this food but when they brought it out it was dry there was no seasoning on the food and after 30 minutes I started feeling sick. Don't trust this place it looks very unsanitary!!!"}
{"text":"Second time here and I must say it wasn't as good. Service was slow, premises were unkept/dirty. It is a hole in the wall type of place but it didn't look very clean. There were dirty tables everywhere and food crumbs on the floor. That said the food was good. The Bistec is flavorfull and I like that the Masa isn't very thick or doughy so that's a plus. The rice and beans were bland. The tinga could use more spice or a kick but it was ok."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and the food is great and the service is great. I gave 4 stars because they always run out of avocado when i'm there which is a bummer because it's my favorite part lol."}
{"text":"food prices are high but seriously over $9 for an \"okay\" machete.  not to mention i had to order (3) times because they were out of this or that.  i wanted beef and each time the girl asked me if i would like to order chicken.  what was chicken on sale or brought from their farm?  i definitely will not be going back there"}

I stumbled upon Machete Azteca by accident. I was across the street at the Asian grocery store picking up some items for home when hunger struck. As I was leaving the Asian grocery store the Machete Azteca sign caught my eye. I pulled into the parking lot and noticed a sign on the door that \"Best of Phoenix Winner\". I knew that I was about to walk into something special, but I had no idea just how special this hidden spot was going to be.

The serving sizes are large, so you get a lot of food for your money at Machete Azteca. Bring your appetite when you come because you're going to want to order more than just one dish once you see the menu. Everything on the menu looked amazing. We ordered four dishes and I wanted to order four more, but obviously, that would have been way too much food for two people. I will come back often and try something different every time.

The first dish to arrive was the Papas Locas, or Crazy Potatoes. This was a great appetizer that tasted every bit as good as it looked. The cheese, meat (carne asada), and sour cream atop a bed of french fries was a great way to warm my stomach up for what was about to come.

Then came the Quesadilla de Chicharron Prensado. The first thing you notice is the size of the quesadilla. It's a 16-inch tortilla stuffed with tender pork, cheese, and green salsa, all made a magnificent bright orange color from the pork oils and marinade that was used. There are three types of salsa at the table, one is a cilantro avocado sauce, another is a red sauce which had just the right amount of heat, and the last one was a jalapeno sauce that packed a huge amount of flavor.

Next there was the Huaraches de Bistec Encebollado. A thin and fluffy homemade masa dough with a thin layer of smashed pinto beans, followed by a thin layer of white cheese, topped by a hefty layer of Bistec beef mixed with grilled onions and jalapenos. This was such an impressive dish with all of the flavors exploding in my mouth that I almost thought about not sharing it with my camera girl, hahaha!

The last part of our meal was a Mexico City classic beef broth, Caldo de Res. The mild and well balanced soup is an instant favorite and makes you feel instantly comfortable. The tender beef melted in my mouth and the bone in the soup only added to the already great flavor provided by the corn, carrots, potatoes, and zucchini. This might be one of my new favorite Mexican soups. 

While I have a lot of experience eating Sonoran-style Mexican food, I had no experience eating Mexico City style Mexican Food. But the staff at Machete Azteca were very helpful and friendly. They enthusiastically helped me with the menu, and I enthusiastically ate everything they put in front of me. A big thank you to all of the friendly and helpful staff at Machete Azteca. 

Machete Azteca has two locations, this one is open 7-days per week. On weekdays they are open from 10:00AM until 9:45PM and on weekends they open two hours earlier at 8:00AM. This restaurant is in an unassuming location. You could easily drive right by it without ever noticing there is even a restaurant there. Use your GPS or your phone's map app to make things easier. Of for those that are winging it, this restaurant is on the South-West corner of West Indian School Road and North 67th Ave, next to the gas station."}
