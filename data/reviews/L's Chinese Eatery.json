{"text":"For the price, the lunch specials are well worth it. Lunch specials are on until 3pm. 

We ordered some specials like ma-po tofu, General Tsao chicken and corn/fish on rice. All were priced between $5-6. 

The portions were good. My ma-po tofu was big enough to split into 2 meals. The staff was friendly but did get one of our orders wrong. To be fair we did have a group of 12. 

The restaurant is small but has 2 large round tables and a few smaller tables. The plaza doesn't have too much parking but the plaza isn't usually packed so we didn't have troubles finding a spot (but we did go on a Sunday). 

We'll come back because of the price and location."}
{"text":"Food is good and prices very reasonable. I've been here twice and both times we've had quick service. The food was delicious. The owners are friendly and the decor is comfy too."}

First review of the year after a 3-month hiatus from smart-phones and data plans (less Yelping). But I'm back! Let's get to the good stuff already:

My first visit to this relatively new restaurant in the Scarborough area was during lunch. They have a pretty decent lunch menu for a good price before 3pm. Their lunch portions were actually filling for $5.95 and the general chicken was surprisingly good!

2nd visit (dinner): I came with a party of 12 since Congee places in the area were full and we didn't want to wait 30-40mins. We were seated promptly and though they do not serve any congee, their chicken corn soup and wonton soup was really good (especially on a cold winter night). No one ever says \"this chicken corn soup is amazing\", but that night a few people did. There were copious amounts of actual chicken pieces in the soup and the consistency was perfect (not too thin and not so thick that it becomes obvious the main ingredient was corn starch). 

Other menu items ordered: 
Beef Tenderloin on Sizzling Platter - the beef was actually tender, the dish sizzled (not always the case in other places)  and was nicely \"peppered\".

Three Kinds of Mushrooms and Vegetables Stir Fry - good mushroom portions, taste was a little lacking - perhaps more oyster sauce?

Deep Fried Calamari w/ Spicy Salt  - I'll eat any and all kinds of deep fried calamari, though I have had better.

Malaysian Style Fried Rice Noodle w/ Shrimp and BBQ Pork - probably the least-liked dish of the night. Didn't have much flavor going for it.

Yeung Chow Fried Rice - it's hard to mess up this Asian-resto staple.

Lemon Chicken - our non-Asian friends loved it! Super-crispy and yet you're not chewing mostly on batter. Chicken was moist and the sauce was just right in its acidic/sweet tones.

Ma Po Tofu - I'm not the best judge on this traditional Chinese comfort food but as most of us who have never tried this dish loved it, I'm guessing they do it well?

(Their website menu for prices: http://lschineseeatery.com/menu)

Just a note: This is a fairly small restaurant (I think it seats 35-ish?) and I have never seen it full to capacity. That being said, their service was wonderful (topped off our waters, refilled our tea pots) & they were very accommodating to our requests (less salt, more napkins, another bowl etc.). 

In reality I think this place is a 3.5/5, but their service was well-executed and they made me look good in front of family and friends for choosing the place after we ran out of dining options - so I'm giving them a 4! Needless to say, we have all found our own (new) little restaurant to frequent that provides great service and pretty good food. Welcome to Scarborough \"L\"!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are very good tasting and good portions.  I recommend the Ho Fon noodles with beef and black bean sauce."}
{"text":"Always ordered food here, (lived around the area) their food is not salty or greasy, love their pork bbq and hot sour soup is good. Kept me warm for hours.

Service is good and washroom is clean, it is not your typical chinese placw. Will always go here and a good addition in the area"}
{"text":"Wow, was this place ever bad.  My family and I ordered some chicken balls, and the texture and taste was awful.  Is that even chicken?  It had the most unusual consistency.  My sister and I literally spat our first bites out into a tissue and didn't eat the rest.  No one bothered to finish theirs.  We all agreed they were really bad.  The same goes for the chicken fried rice.  It had basically no taste, and similarly mysterious chicken.  The only part of the meal that was decent were the egg rolls.  I didn't even bother to try the lemon chicken because the chicken balls were so bad.  Even the deep fried chicken wings (that one usually can't go wrong with at a Chinese restaurant) were mediocre.  We'll definitely never eat from here again."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times, good time to write a review. 

I usually come here around lunch time and their lunch specials are pretty good price-wise because their portion sizes are large. Sometimes I even have leftovers. 
Dishes I've tried:

~Cantonese Chow Mein: A lot of the time when I order this dish in other places, the noodles are way too greasy. From this restaurant however, the noodles were the right texture and flavor and not greasy but it had the perfect amount of the \"sauce\" if you will. Vegetables in the dish were flavored nicely, and there was a generous amount of them and the chicken. 
~House Special Pad Thai Rice Noodle: I order pad thai a lot. It's one of my favourite dishes to eat. It didn't look like your typical authentic pad thai dish, but hey there may be different versions of it that I don't know about. (I'm no food expert). I think that overall there was more of the noodle than any of the other ingredients, but the flavours were delicious. 
~Pork Chop w/ Sweet and Sour Sauce: I really enjoyed this dish. Flavours were great. Generous portion of the rice and pork. Tasted authentic. Not much more to say about a great dish. 
~Dinner for Three: 3 Egg Rolls,  Chicken Mixed Vegetables, Sweet and Sour Pork , Beef with Mushroom, Steamed Rice, 3 Fortune Cookies: Overall my family and I really enjoyed this meal. This was enough food to feed all 5 of us. Again, great flavours, and everything was just cooked well and just right. 

The restaurant itself has a nice peaceful atmosphere. TVs if you want. Very clean and presentable."}
{"text":"We just ordered from L's for the first time. We ordered delivery and we were quite impressed!! We just finished eating 5 min ago and I felt compelled to write a review right away. L's opened recently -- it seems to have replaced the chinese place Holima (they even keep the same phone number). Good move too, since Holima was terrible.

(prices are as of June 2013)

Spring rolls and egg rolls ($1.20 each) -- were both very good, although about the same as basically every other chinese place. Still quite tasty. I like how they asked if we wanted vegetable or meat inside the egg rolls -- rather than just assuming. It's those small things that make a difference.

Har Gaw and Sui Mai ($3.25 each) -- these are two dim sum appetizers traditionally served together. We were impressed with both. Being more of a pork fan, I preferred the Sui Mai (very tasty), while my roommate preferred the shrimp-based Har Gaw. Either way, both were prepared very well, presented nicely, and were nicely seasoned. You get 4 of each per dish.

Shrimp Fried Rice ($7.95) -- I actually liked it. It wasn't like COVERED in soy sauce or whatever else other chinese places use, in which it ends up dark brown, and ends up very salty or heavy. Here, it is white, and seemed closer to steamed rice, but with nice flavour. You get quite a large quantity, too.

Spicy Eggplant and Minced Pork  ($8.95) -- quite tasty! One of the better dishes I've had from a chinese place. Nice flavour, just the right level of spice! Maybe a BIT too \"soupy\" in texture, but it was very saucy which I liked. The portion was enough to feed me and my roommate for both lunch and then later for dinner.

What else to note?

- There were zero errors with our order, both in terms of the food and the pricing
- Free delivery over $20 is a nice touch (I hate delivery fees)
- The delivery guy was very friendly, more so than others I've dealt with
- It took a little more than the half hour we were quoted, but that's no big deal

Oh, and by the way, their website is great! I checked it out after ordering and was very impressed!

OTHER RESTAURANT WEBSITES: LEARN FROM L'S! NO FLASH! NO GIMMICKS!

It was just a clean, well laid out site with the full menu in plain text (with prices), as well as their hours, contact information, and location with a map link. That is literally all you need!

My only main complaint may be the price -- it's probably on par with other chinese places, but still too much. $8.95 or $9.25 for each entr√©e added up quickly.

Overall, I was very impressed with L's -- as I continue on forward and go back to L's (which I am sure we will), I'll try new stuff and I'll update my review.

*** Update: 3 weeks later ***

We got delivery from L's again. We got some new items:

Hakka Chow Mein ($8.95) -- I was not impressed. Rather plain, not enough flavour. I guess it was fine, but nothing I'd get again.

Pan Fried Pork Dumpling ($4.50) -- quite a tasty appetizer. You get 5 in the order. They have a lot of pork inside. Nice flavour, pair well with soy sauce.

Singapore Style Fried Vermicelli ($7.95) -- tastes good, but not spicy enough for something with a spicy symbol next to it. It was serviceable but could've been better.

Manchurian Style Fried Rice ($7.95) -- wow that was delightfully good! The rice is like a DEEP RED in colour, and has a great type of spice, and a ton of flavour.

General Tao Chicken ($8.95)  -- very good. Similar to other places that serve the same item. Good use of ingredients to make the sauce."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the area. 
The food is great and the service is exceptional!

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the true hidden gems in the Toronto area! They just opened recently and the place is newly renovated with nice decor. The food was delicious as usual when I came with my friends and the service was very good. This isn't your usual fast food Chinese restaurant as it serves dishes normally served in full-sized family Chinese restaurants. We had a variety of seafood, rice and noodle dishes and we were pleased. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"L'S Chinese Eatery is a good addition in the neighbourhood. 

The deco is simple but clean. The menu has a mixture of Cantonese, Hakka and even some Asian Fusion choices (Thai? Japanese Udon?)

Dropped by here for a late lunch and I was the only customer there. What's good to eat? The server suggested the Chili Chicken Rice on a Dish ($7.50) as L'S chef suppose to be good in preparing Hakka dishes...

This is definitely not the usual Chili Chicken I used to. The sauce here is not as oily, dense but light with a lemon undertone. The battered white meat is a little dry though.

Portion is huge here. I have to pack half to go for lunch tomorrow.... 

The service here is really family casual.
