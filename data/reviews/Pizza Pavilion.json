{"text":"No. Just. No.  The guy behind the counter has the filthiest shirt on ever.  It was so gross.  Then the pizza was burnt.  I should have walked away based on the shirt alone but hunger got the better of me....then.....I wised up, threw the pizza away and ate the orange I had in my bag."}
{"text":"You'd never think Kennywood would have decent pizza, but this was more than decent. I loiked their fresh fruit parfaits also with whipped cream they pipe on from a pastry bag. Good stuff."}
{"text":"The Kennywood Krucible Part 8:   Kennywood Park has two such in-park outlets for pizza pies: This one and another called Pizza Warehouse. At some point during the day, after having a catered, picnic-style dinner courtesy of Kay's employer, Kay decided that she wanted a small pizza. Their personal pies had caught our eyes along with their whipped cream-centered fresh fruit parfaits (we had no room or time to try them) when we stopped by for beverages earlier. Keeping them in mind, we went back. My appetite had began to wane during the day, an assault from the Aero 360 not helping. Alas, I saw that pretty, puffy pie and had to have a bite. The crust, despite its bloated form, was more crispy than chewy, and its cheese and sauce were positively vibrant on the palate, all of it having been expertly seasoned.   I don't know if these are made on the premises or brought in. I honestly couldn't tell either way and was happily astonished to find that they are near-divine."}
