I have ordered delivery from Pho Lam using skipthedishes application. They sent me fresh roll with shrimp when I have ordered fresh roll with shrimp and bbq pork. I have ordered 3 of the fresh rolls for $8.50. When I contacted them, the restaurant's manager said, they didn't have BBQ pork at the time so they put extra shrimp, and they are willing to give me $5 credit towards my next order. First of all, they should have contacted me before making the decision to deliver me a different dish, and I highly doubt extra shrimp was put into the fresh rolls, since I could only find 3 shrimps (cocktail shrimp sized) in thick 15cm length rolls. (I don't think normal rolls would just have 2 shrimps in them. If they do, no one would ever go to the restaurant.) $5 credit is less than 59% of the amount of money paid for the specific menu. When I told them that what they have offered me is ridiculous, they made a re-delivery of fresh roll with shrimp and bbq pork. I wonder how they managed to get the pork so fast mid-day.

I DO NOT LIKE DISHONEST BUSINESSES. Who knows what dishonest things they might do (especially to my food)?"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho place in Mississauga.  Especially their number 513 which include bean curl wrap is really good. Washroom is really clean unlike many other restaurant. Worth giving a try if you are in for Pho :)."}
{"text":"This is pretty much is the only pho place that I really look forward to coming to when I'm in the Mississauga area. Their portions are generous, the soup and noodles taste great, and the owners are friendly."}
{"text":"Broth wasn't that tasty, I don't find it salty.  The xl pho comes with the same takeout container of a medium broth container. Thus, there wasn't enough broth. There's enough meat in the house special, bc it was an  xl, it's expected.  The rare beef came rare with blood, packed beside the noodles. The broth was lukewarm or basically the same heat as a dormant tap water.  Not very good takeout because you have to heat up the soup. A four minute microwave didn't even warm it up enough to cook the rare beef. So I basically had to take out the soup pan to heat it over the stove.  Really hard to eat this takeout because there is no soup bowl.

Also ordered the vermicelli with pork. The pork was very limited. About palm sized.

They didn't give chopsticks and hot sauce.

Ordered via ubereats. By the way, ubereats customer service is horrible, the app doesn't work, it accepts codes but does not apply any savings, costs more, does not specify utensils or extras and skipthedishes seems a lot better. First time ordering in. Never again ubereats.  Don't order delivery via ubereats"}
{"text":"Within one of many depressing strip malls in Mississauga. Mississauga UGLY, right??
I thought the pho was very good, big spring rolls. Fair prices."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came here for a late dinner and I'm so glad we did! There is tons of other Vietnamese places around here (literally saw 3 pho restaurants within 2 minute walks) but I'm glad we came here. The service was great, our waitress was extremely friendly and the food came relatively fast. My sister actually got the wrong order (grilled chicken with rice and fried egg when she ordered grilled chicken with fish) and the waitress was happy to bring the order of fish. I got the house special which was steaming hot and delicious! My other sisters got an order of pho and a rice dish and they enjoyed it. The prices were affordable and all our dishes were under $10. The only thing I wouldn't recommend getting is the fried spring rolls - they were dripping with oil. Otherwise, I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"They've really perfected the broth here for sure. Not over saturated with salt like some places. Still feels like you're eating a very healthy meal. Seats could definitely use an upgrade but the interior design/atmosphere still looks great.

also free WIFI!!"}
{"text":"I know why people have been coming here:  It's relatively new, it's in a convenient plaza with plenty of parking (albeit slightly ghetto), FREE WIFI, & their small pho is $6!  I think that's about it in an intersection that is littered with pho joints.

Broth itself wasn't the tastiest, slightly on the salty side, passable.  Noodles were nice and not overcooked.  I wished they had the fresh chilli sauce that is on the table of most pho places.  Pho Lam only had Sriracha & what I'm assuming was hoisin sauce.

Drinks were also cheaper than other pho places, so that is rather attractive.

El Cheapo Tip:  If you're just there for a quick, cheap meal, share the 2nd pho with 1 other person.  It only comes in XL and it's $9, plenty for 2 smallish women!  ;)"}
{"text":"Salty broth. The Medium was small compared to other pho places. I don't get why when you ask for rare beef pho, the beef comes already cooked!! I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I drove past this place many times in the past, and I'm pretty sure it was a Pho-Mi 99 before, but changed its name to Pho Lam not too long ago.  Their ordering sheet still has Pho-Mi 99 on it!

This restaurant's interior is the complete opposite of the plaza it is located in.  Very sleek, modern, and clean! The parking lot is a complete mess with pot holes everywhere, and the plaza itself is really sketchy in my opinion.  However, don't let this deter you from eating here or you could regret it!

In terms of food, to my surprise, it was really good! We ordered the Thai Grilled Squid which was seasoned well.  The only weird thing about it was that it came with nothing.  Literally, nothing.  We had to ask for extra rice and bowls to share, since it was a solo dish.  We also ordered the Thai Hot Pot which was the highlight of the meal.  Their soup base was on point! Also, the seafood which came with it was sufficient for 4 adults.  For $40, this was amazing on a cold Canadian spring day.  Was extremely happy with the food!

Anyways, I have yet to try the Pho or Rice dishes here, but in terms of the Hotpot, it was amazing! A little kinks can be worked out but I will be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Just like many of the Pho restaurants in the area, the Pho here is consistent. The food is great. I haven't had a bad meal here. It's well seasoned, the broth is good and best of all they are open late. Great for those late night hunger cravings. It's consistently good. If it blew me away, it would get a fifth star."}
{"text":"This is the best pho place in GTA! The soup is very tasty, yet not too salty or anything. Its grilled pork is also worth a try."}
