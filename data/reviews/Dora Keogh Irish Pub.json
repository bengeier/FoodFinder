{"text":"There perfect place for a genuine pub night with friends. The atmosphere is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'll first start off by saying that I hate giving such a low rating, especially for a bar that has potential to be so much better.

When Dora Keogh's opened, I was really excited to have what appeared to be a nice  and comfortable bar, reminiscent of Ireland.  It's really anything but, with the exception of the home-style kitchen in the back.  Those who know Ireland will understand what I mean.

Anyway, the whole place seems really barren with very little 'craic' or liveliness.  I did go one Friday night last year and it was a different place altogether (excellent live music, packed) but that may have been a special event.  I've been enough times to see that was an exception.

I find the bar prices to be slightly on the higher end which I don't mind paying if there's a good ambiance.  I think Dora's needs to take a closer look at the local clientele and what draws the locals, or at least those who are going to spend some money.

It's a great space, just lacks excitement.  In one world, 'blah',"}
{"text":"Been there quite a few times. Band can be fun, but the bar staff are among the rudest I've ever dealt with. I'd be angry too if I never got a tip, but they might want understand that in order to get a tip, you need to provide service and not be an miserable SOB. 

Their loss. Good luck."}
{"text":"Dropped by Allens the other night, and noticed that food is now availalbe next door at Dora Keogh. I decided to try it and as it was very busy, Holiday Shopping week, I sat at the bar. The food menu is limited but what I had, Soup and Capon Wings were both delicious.
Certainly, would recommend the place for a lighter meal than Allens."}
{"text":"I came here on St. Patrick's Day and had sooo much fun!"}
{"text":"Beautiful selection of whisky and the owner (who also owns and runs Allen's next door) is awesome. The live music and unique atmosphere really make this place special."}
{"text":"This is a lovely pub. It is just like a bar back in Ireland. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff are great. Nice Guinness too."}
{"text":"music and atmosphere great. but please please get new benches. the current ones are narrow,puffy (the back) and uncomfortable. pints r very good.didnt eat there,but Allen's next door has amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Comme Allen's tout à côté, j'ai fréquenté ce pub pendant plusieurs années, depuis son ouverture. Plus rustique en apparence, c'est un pub irlandais dans le style du pays avec ses petits coins privés, sa belle cuisine et son bar équipé des meilleurs whiskys. De temps à autres, des musiciens viennent y jouer un ceili, comme si vous étiez à Galway : cornemuse irlandaise, fiddle et bodhran créeront une atmosphère complémentaire à un bon Red Breast sans glace."}
{"text":"Come for a Guinness, stay for the snug!  There is literally a private room built into this pub with a little window opening directly on the bar, so you don't even have to leave your group's sanctuary to get more beverages.  Make sure to call ahead and reserve it though; it's a popular spot."}
{"text":"Dora Keogh's is my second favourite Irish bar in Toronto, just behind PJ O'Briens.

We dropped by for a drink last night and to enjoy the live music. The drinks were good and I was excited to see they had Keogh's Irish chips, although they were almost past their expiration date and were $4.50 a bag!

The service here is predictably Irish which makes me feel right at home. During the summer they have a nice patio out front so you can people watch while enjoying your pint.

The live music is always enjoyable and makes for a fun night out when people get up and start dancing.

There is definitely a large Irish contingent here and I could hear a few familiar accents around the bar. An evening at Dora Keogh's is guaranteed to be a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Dora's experience fluctuates. There are times the thing rocks like C-Deck on the Titanic and other times it's just a boring, empty place with copper tables, three nose-picking bartenders and a noticeable detergent whiff. I have not found out yet on what days it's packed as opposed to empty but it could have something to do with bands playing or book-signing sessions to bring in the crowds. Dora's also varies on quality of beer. There are times when I feel sick, hot and cold the next morning after having drunken a few pints of cider or draught, other times I'm fit as a fiddle afterwards. Strange. Really really strange. However, great location, huge potential and on busy nights there's even some eye candy for the sexually inclined. Dora's is definitely worth the odd visit. 

One thing I noticed on a negative note, Dora's (in February 2011) has received a conditional pass from health Canada. WTF??? That I cannot appreciate, because in my eyes, hygiene is not an extra, it's a prerequisite to a successful venue."}
{"text":"We ended up here as Allen's next door was filled to capacity (they are apparently a sister concern to Allen's). For starters its hard to even spot the name of this establishment and I had to ask the servers what is it called (for Yelp Check in of course ;) and once you get in you get this strange vibe as something is of with the setup. There is open space in an area which seems like its setup for a live band. Then there is an odd seating configuration which throws one off. All this could have been acceptable if they had decent beer list. Unlike Allen's next door they are limited to just generic stuff. I ended up ordering a steam whistle and my friends ordered a Guinness and glass of Canadian Red (just vile vile stuff). 
There were quite a few people here as it seems like a neighborhood watering hole. I wouldn't recommend this spot as I there are quite a few good options nearby."}
{"text":"Ah Doras....

So the food isn't consistent and the beers are expensive.. .so why am I giving Doras 4 stars? Well quite simply, this bar is as close as you are going to to get to a proper pub in Toronto.  There are no flat screen TVs to be seen, the bar tables are encased in copper and all the bartenders are from Eire. There is a two proper snugs (little enclosed room for chatting) as well as a nice little stage. 

What makes this bar is the music. Every Thursday Night and Saturday afternoon, Doras has a traditional Irish music session that attracts the best Irish musicians in Toronto and occasionally visiting traditional musicians as well. There is a great atmosphere with kids running around, people of all ages and everyone enjoying the Craic (The other kind: Irish for good time)."}
{"text":"We had a group and booked a table IN THE KITCHEN. This was a great and authentic Irish experience. 

This was a couple of years ago, but I have recommended this experience to numerous people who have all enjoyed. 

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's got beer, live music, a couple of separated smaller rooms and old wooden floors.

Feels like an Irish pub without it feeling like a carnival ride (i.e. over the top, try really hard, welcome to Ireland with tartan clad lassie's.. hmm wait.  I like tartan clad lassies!!)

That's what they need here.. more lassies!

No servers... go get beer at the bar yourself.  At least.. no one was serving us.

... so go.. don't go.. whatevs.. I gots to go google me some lassies now.

{"text":"Maybe Irish pubs are not my style... 

I came by once night after a long walk with some friends to grab a pint. It was nearly 10 on a Thursday night and I hadn't eaten dinner, so I was hoping to grab a bite. Unfortunately I didn't see any food menus or servers. It was self serve, bar service, which is perfectly fine with me.

They also had a live band - traditional Irish music. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had more energy and not so hangry. 

I'll give it another shot, and update my review another time."}
{"text":"I don't really like pubs as I don't drink, and this one looked quite expensive. Still, I went there because a friend wanted to go to a Irish pub and it was his birthday. Well, I got instantly happy when I got there and listened to some group playing really good irish folk music! Really, I never saw something like that live, and I love this kind of music, so most of the rating is because of that. Maybe it was luck, though, we went on a sunday.

I ate a cheddar hamburguer, I didn't like that it was 1 dollar more expensive than in the menu, but it was somewhat good (although expensive) and I think it was healthier than most hamburguers I have eaten on Toronto. 

Although I don't like beers, my friends did really like it. I drank some of their beer and I think it tasted better than most of what I have drunk in my life (not much). There was a beer with coffee, I think, that tasted really good.

Definitely going back if there is more music like that."}
{"text":"Most authentic irish pub in downtown toronto. A cracking pint of Guinness. Hushed, old-school feel, decked out in mostly wooden furniture. Best part: live music and traditional irish sessions. The best irish musicians in toronto can be found playing together here on Thursday nights and Saturday afternoons. You might not realize what a treat this is, but for those of you who understand the fantabulousness, joyousness and good fortune of this, belly up to the bar at these times and enjoy music and an environment that will take you back to some of the most coveted sessions in the Emerald Isle."}
{"text":"Alright little pub. Live music, full bar. Nothing spectacular, nothing to complain about. Solid stop for a pint or cocktail."}
{"text":"I like the Dora Keough. I mainly go here to attend book-related events, mainly launches and readings. The space is small and intimate and perfect for these kinds of events, and I've had fun hearing authors read from their novels and non-fiction books and telling the story behind the book. The bar is well stocked and comfortable to sit at. The food is pretty good. The staff is friendly and courteous. I've been here dozens of times and have always had a good experience.

At the back of the pub is a kitchen, complete with a stove and a harvest table and sideboard, reminiscent of those you'd find in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. I've always wanted to rent out the room and have a kitchen party. I haven't yet, but it's on my extended bucket list."}
{"text":"I have to agree with todd v. in that there is no pretension here.  its decked in wood, in brass, in glass, in great beer.  ive been to fundraisers here, come in and heard a jig or two and just lulled at the bar for no other reason than to lull and meet a few folks perhaps.

the energy there is always festive, especially with more people present.  in addition to the seats at the bar, there are very comfortable seats lining the walls, each with a small table, and some seats separating those seats from the bar and some of those middle seats are sectioned off with more wood and brass providing a little privacy."}
{"text":"dora's has one of the better pints of guinness in the city.

The bartenders know how to pour it, and that helps.

I like dora's alot. It definitely is the most authentic-LOOKING Irish pub in the city. I wouldn't say it IS the most authentic Irish pub in Toronto though..... ;)

The staff are very good, and if you can catch a session, usually thursdays and sundays, then you will certainly not be dissappointed.
You must go on one of these evenings, if you are looking for an entertaining few hours of pints, and 'ol trad music.

alright. so ya heard it here. Definitely recommended, mainly on thurs, and sun.

{"text":"Came in for a couple beers before a show at Danforth Music Hall. Service was decent, sat in the snug to catch up with an old buddy. My friend ordered the burger and liked it a lot, I ordered the onion rings and was presented with a plate of barely battered, greasy slices of onion that were less than appealing, to say the least. In a word: gross. Sorry to say I won't be stopping in again."}
{"text":"The sister pub to Allen's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/allens-restaurant-on-the-danforth-toronto), Dora Keogh began as an experiment to determine if they could make an authentic Irish pub without the trappings of the tartan-short-skirt pubs that dot the city that start with \"Duke of\" or cute double-entendre names like The Pour House (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pour-house-irish-pub-toronto).  In comes Dora, which is by far the most authentic Irish bar that you'll find this side of the Atlantic.  Of if you went the wrong way, the Pacific, for that matter.

As soon as you step in, you're faced with a long bar and open area at the back for open stage music and jam sessions that take place every Thursday and Sunday.  Benches line the side of the bar with most of the other seats being of the stool variety.  Down you sit at a small copper-topped table with a properly poured pint and an atmosphere that is truly not like any other found in most Toronto faux-Irish pubs.  It's a fantastic place to sit down, enjoy a pint, listen to the reeling, and have a blether.  You have to see it to believe."}
{"text":"Tonight (Tuesday) I went to Dora Keogh for drinks.  

FRUIT FLIES
This was the one thing I couldn't stand. There were fruit flies all over the place. I was swatting them every couple of minutes.  They were even at the bar and at the tables next to us.  What was worse was one flew into my drink.  I bet I ate some too.

WASHROOMS
ok I had no idea which washrooms were for male or female b/c they used some different language which I don't think has german roots.  The only reason I knew which one to go to was b/c someone wrote in little letters \"men\" on the man's door.  So that was a bit annoying.

Also they don't have a hook for your purse/coat.  They only have a counter next to the toilet which can get really dirty. So I didn't really like that.

SERVICE
Great! everyone was really nice, the prices were reasonable.

The flies really bugged me (pun intended....i'm corny i know) and I don't think i'll go there again by choice b/c of it. Just imagine the cleanliness at the back.  But if a group of friends wanted to go, then ya...i'd go. That's why I gave it a 3."}
{"text":"Stopped in to see The Swingin' Blackjacks, probably the best Rockabilly band in the city!
Had a great time, nice comfortable place to hang out at.
Very Irish. Good beer. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Previously I would have said this was my absolute favourite pub in Toronto, no doubt.  I have happily travelled from the other side of town just for a pint here. 

But... I paid a visit this weekend and am sad to report things have gone downhill. Primarily because they don't have the wood burning fire anymore. This was the biggest attraction for me, by a country mile. It was so lovely to sit by the fire with a pint, watch the flames flicker, and listen to the Irish trad music. I mean, can you think of anything nicer on a frosty Toronto evening?

Apparently they have now given up on the fire because it's too expensive. Huge mistake in my opinion--it was what made this place special. With the fire, the space is warm, comfy, homely-- perfect for settling in for a few hours. Without it, the space can be dark, cold and dingy. With the fire, I would happily pay over the odds for a pint, but without it, you really start to notice the excessive cost of a beer here. With the fire, I wouldn't mind so much that for over a year now, their website has given the wrong day for the weekly ceili sessions (they are on Saturday, not Sunday--although actually the website says both, on two different pages), meaning I have now turned up twice expecting see trad music and been met by an empty, cold, dark pub. WIthout the fire, I just have no reason to stay and I am actually pretty peeved that once again I had to make this wasted trip all the way across to the Danforth, just because they care so little about the details that they can't be bothered to give correct information to save customers a wasted trip--even after a year!!!

It kind of breaks my heart to say it but I probably won't be back, at least not until the fire is up and running again."}
{"text":"Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars, Dora Keogh is a diamond in the rough. In the sidebar it says this Irish pub is not suitable for kids, but boy is that wrong. Many kids were underfoot and enjoying the live music on Saturday. We stopped in to meet some friends and their newborn. Their toddler (and another two) were enjoying the music, dancing and socializing. The bar even has juice boxes!

We didn't eat any food but the beer is well poured. The music was fantastic and it was delightful to see the little ones clap after each song even if the adults didn't.

If you absolutely dislike children at pubs, I'd say try somewhere else. But for an authentic family feel and inclusivity, this place delivers."}
{"text":"Five stars for an authentic Irish pub with live music and an excellent pint of Guinness! We came here during the Taste of the Danforth and were star-struck at how amazing this place is. All staff were Irish, the stage was huge, and there was plenty of space inside and out. Pro tip: There's even Irish crisps (chips) served here, so get them with your pint of beer! Fast service and cold pints. A wonderful addition to the Irish community in Toronto. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I ended up here last Saturday night after a full day of events. This place is your typical Irish pub in the area. It had the live band, full packed bar, and tons of people. We arrive around 11 which at that point was too late. After a few we managed to find a place to sit in the little closed section off to the side. I enjoyed what they were trying to acheive with the space but found it very awekward. The booth was high, the table and stools were so low it was like sitting at a kiddie table with a bunch of adults. That section also had its own little ordering window which I found quite neat. Throughout the night i saw the bartenders jumpping in and out of the window several times which kept me entertained. 

This place was out of my way and i'd prob wouldnt make my way down there unless I had a specific reason to go back."}
{"text":"By far the best small authentic Irish pub in the city, with no frills selection of popular beers and live music on weekends, this is a Danforth institution.

Solid wood bars and fixtures, \"snugs\" for intimate seating, an authentic country kitchen available for group bookings, and a patio for the warmer months, a lot is packed into this small space.

Noticed a few other reviewers lamented the lack of food options and beer selection. This is not that kind of pub. If you want a fancy microbrew or hot meals, go next door to Allen's (same owner). Here you get Guinness, Harp, Kilkenny and a few other well known brands and bags of crisps. The food comes from next door anyway, unless you book the Irish kitchen for a group.

There is no table service. Like a real Irish pub you go to the bar to get your order. I suggest tipping still, unlike back home where younwouldnt normally, only because it's still Canada and that's how the bar/restaurant industry is set up here.

Love the live music and I was there on a Sunday night that would be next to dead at any other place, but Dora was packed and the crown was having fun dancing along to traditional jigs and reels.

This place cannotnbe passed up if you are looking for a genuine, cozy and entertaining Irish pub experience."}
{"text":"Not just a great Irish Pub but one of the better, smaller pub's in the city.
The best aspect for me is the live music on various nights of the week.
A group of people get together and have a jam session of old Irish tunes and it is unique. 
A collection of fiddles, pipes and even a harp get into the action.  They all just sit around and play while you sit back and have one of the best pints of Guinness that Toronto has to offer.
They also have Tato Crisps right from the emerald isles just to make it all that more official that this is an Irish pub.  
If you can, get a group together and get a meal in the back.  For groups, they open this big old kitchen in the back, sit you all around a big wooden table and cook a homemade meal for you right in the same room.
Best nights at this place?  Cold winter evenings when it's not too crowded.  Go sit in the back by the wood fire place, keep warm and indulge in libation.  Very nice place to have a drink."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's decorated very much like a traditional Irish pub, and has a similar feel inside to one too. There's a good selection of Irish beers, although I was disappointed they only had the \"original\" Guinness, and none of the other varieties. 
Personally I prefer Guinness Cold and would have liked the option.

We had some appetizers, which were very tasty, especially the mini-pizzas and vegetable spring rolls. A wonderful balance of spice and herbs to give a great flavour explosion in your mouth.

The writing on the toilets is in Gaelic, which could be confusing if you don't know which is male and female. I would suggest having a picture too. But otherwise it's good here."}
