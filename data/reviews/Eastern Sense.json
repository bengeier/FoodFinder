{"text":"I had the ma Po tofu and the Cantonese chow mein. Both were good and it was delivered quickly. Ingredients seem fresh. It was good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday on a Sunday night. Nice quiet spot, food was tasteful and reasonably priced. Would come again, loved the chicken wings. :-j"}
{"text":"Food was tasteless and there were only a few thin slices of mushroom in the mushroom fried rice dish. They don't know how to make real fried rice. Maybe they think that they are in a non Chinese area so they cn get away from it. Yes, I am the only Chinese in the restaurant.   There are only four tables including us. The tea was tasteless too and I could count the pieces of tea leaf in the pot. They are so cheap, my friend and I would never go back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews for this place aren't better.  I order it all the time and the whole family loves it.  Beef and Broccoli is excellent.  Portions are generous.  Delivery is quick."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience is 2010 and I still remember it until this day!  They overcharged us for the food that we didn't even order and when we politely brought it up they were completely unprofessional and extremely rude about it - waiter was horrible - there was only 1 other table in the restaurant yet we still waited a good 20 minutes for the waiter to even notice us to get the bill..."}
{"text":"three things i always get here are their spicy chicken wings, beef fried rice and egg drop soup! this place never disappoints. it is a bit fancier than it needs to be but im not complaining. its usually not that busy and i think its because this place is hidden and its beside all companies etc. ive been here multiple times and i am definitely a returning customer. the owner of this place is also really nice!"}
{"text":"Went back to our favorite Chinese food place in Woodbridge with some friends on a weekend.  Nice place for an informal dinner at a great price and really great food with generous portions for the cost. We had cashew chicken, cantonese chow mein, crispy ginger beef and beef and vegetables, and all of it was delicious.  Egg drop soup was also very good.  Cant wait to go back. Be prepared that this is not a fast place, but waiting a bit for the food to be cooked fresh is worth the wait and the appetizers do come out fast."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had the pork egg foo young and the seafood with mushrooms and chinese broccoli. Both were piping hot and cooked perfectly.  The broccoli was al dente and the seafood was just cooked. The flavours were wonderful. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is good, but this is not a vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurant as we found out when visiting here recently. All of their food is cooked in the same wok and same fryer. So, they mix all of their vegetarian food with all of their meat food, which is just a shame.   The overall restaurant is very clean, polite staff. I just wish real vegetarians could eat here!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place didn't have enough reviews! It was pretty good food. Reasonable price too. I got delivery done so don't know about the restaurant itself. It's worth checking out!"}
