{"text":"Sushi is unbelievable. I am from Bethel but have lived in Atlanta for a while now. I've had plenty of wonderful sushi from all over the country but this is no joke THE BEST. Sounds weird to say but we loved it. Huge portions of fresh fish that melts in your mouth like butter. The Royal Boat is THE best! I've had sushi from fancy places in ATL...LA....and so on...this has been the best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here at least once a week.  The food is delicious, and the servings are generous.  The sushi and sashimi are fresh, and the pad thai and hot & sour soup are wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished eating at the Rice Inn for the first time and will certainly come back.  From the pleasant staff to the delicious food our experience was fantastic. I had the spicy tuna roll and triple delight. My wife had a chicken egg roll and the lemon chicken. We look forward to trying more from their expansive menu!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Cantonese beef chow fun (dry style) this is the place. Tell them to go light on the soy sauce and you have one of the best Chinese street food dishes you can get. The dish is savory - not sweet and sour and not hot and spicy - so may not be to everyone tastes - but it is the real deal. Get it with the side order of the garlic stir fried asparagus.

My son is a big fan of the red dragon roll - but I am chow fun all the way."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places to get Chinese food. I usually get soup, egg roll, and  chicken fried rice (pretty generic order). It has a nice atmosphere on the inside and the staff is always really nice."}
{"text":"So happy that there is a good Chinese place right around our house now.  The food is quality and I am not afraid of what might be under the breading in my General Tso's.  It is  a bit pricier than some other options around us, but I believe it is because we are getting better quality cuts of meat/chicken/seafood in our Chinese/Thai dishes.  

I haven't tried the sushi yet, but I love that it is a fresh bar that you can sit and order from... I will be trying that in the future."}
{"text":"I had the California roll and the Sesame chicken both were very good. The interior was clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and helpful with any questions about menu items. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for affordable and quality cuisine."}
{"text":"The staff is very kind and inviting.  Sushi is extremely fresh.  Live the seaweed salad and spicy squid salad.  If your looking for something healthy they have a nice section where the food is steamed and the sauce is on side which allows to control how much is out on ur food"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have ordered take out.  I really enjoy the food and service but every time I have ordered takeout, my order has been wrong. Always, always check your order before you leave. Also I have noticed on occasion the protein in the meal to be lacking/skimpy on takeout orders."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Rice Inn! I mostly eat lunch there and at times by myself, so it is great that they have the tvs:) 
The food is always fresh and the prices are good and portions are hearty. The staff is so friendly and service is always quick. I NEVER have to wait for a drink refill.
And they always come over to the table and say hi when I have my baby grandson with me:)

Takeout ordering is wonderful too! We had a pretty big order for 5-6 people and not one thing was missed. 

The general tso is my fav meal!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was great, suishi was good. I had the beef Hunan and wife had Kung pao chicken. Reasonably priced, definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Extremely well prepared asian cuisine. Neither greasy or too spicy. Will eat there again!"}
{"text":"The Chinese and Thai food is good for the price. This restaurant is byob with $3 cork fee. Meat is fresh. The sushi is only ok. I had an ocean roll and dragon roll. Dragon was good but I didn't like the ocean roll. Salmon in ocean roll didn't taste as fresh so I didn't eat it; I can be picky. Ichiban has way better sushi. I would go back here though because of good Chinese and thai food plus you can bring your own alcohol. Go elsewhere for sushi."}
{"text":"I'd like to give it 5 stars because we finally found a good  Asian restaurant close to home but I can only give 5 stars for the food, very good sushi! One star for the service, our waitress was not friendly and dropping things in front of us like she didn't want to be bothered. One star for the noise. Why do people have to yell in restaurants now? Obviously no dress code either. I really don't want to see your fat hanging out of your shorts while I'm eating!  Well it is right next to the W**mart!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for decent egg foo young since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007.   Most Chinese restaurants don't serve it and if they do the flavor has been bland at best.  I was surprised and excited to find a restaurant that can actually make a decent egg foo young dish.  I did not eat at the restaurant so I cannot comment on the service.  But the restaurant looked clean and I would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My 2ND favorite restaurant in Bethel Park after Casa Nayarit.  Not real cheap but has lunch special which is when I usually go.  They have sushi and not just the maki rolls, but actual sashimi, really good.  They also have pad Thai, three kinds of curry dishes, edamame, miso soup, lots of different dishes and the basic Chinese.  Don't let the location or the outside of the building turn you off."}
{"text":"Rice inn is clean and has good food with good service. There takeout is always prompt."}
{"text":"We have eaten here once and ordered takeout a few times. Never a bad experience. Once when I got sushi and my wife got a cooked entree for takeout, my sushi was packed with a bag of ice to keep it from warming with her dish. I thought that was a nice touch. Staff is very friendly. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in the restaurant and have had delivery many times so I feel like I can appreciate the quality of food. I love the sushi and sushim. They make very good Hot and Sour soup. The dinner dishes are very good also. Some are better then others but all in all good."}
{"text":"I have to admit, we were a bit skeptical about trying this restaurant based on the location and signage. We read the Yelp reviews and wanted to give it a chance though. It was so awesome! The restaurant is clean, the service was fantastic, and the food was delicious!

We had the shrimp tempura sushi which was just as good as Nakama's.  My husband ordered the bride and groom platter and he loved it. I ordered the shrimp pad thai and received a huge portion at a decent price. They give you a ton of good sized shrimp in the pad thai too-not the small itty bitty ones you often see. The Rice Inn offers Chinese, Japanese, and Thai. We were very impressed and plan on returning! It's great to see different kinds of restaurants in Bethel Park rather than just chains everywhere."}
{"text":"I just wanted too say that I order take out from Rice Inn (Thai Red Curry with Chicken). 
I have to say I have had this dish at many places and this ranks up with the best of them. Nice Job Rice Inn, I will be back and next time I'm bringing the family."}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing and at a great price. The regular Chinese food (general tso's and orange chicken) are also very good and nicely priced. They give you a lot of food and a lot of rice. My boyfriend and I love this place and 100% recommend it!"}
{"text":"We moved to Bethel Park from the SF Bay area and have been feverishly searching for good authentic Chinese takeout.  We would normally have this a couple times a month, as everyone in our family LOVES Chinese food.  After trying a few other places that were a little further drive we landed at Rice Inn.  It is a short drive from our home, but the pricing is VERY expensive and the food was just OK.   The walnut prawns are drowned in  honey sauce making them all sorts of soggy and not appetizing.  Today, we had takeout and when we placed the order on the phone, the girl read it back correctly.  After I got home and unpacked dinner I realized that we were missing chicken fried rice and that we had ordered 2 \"orders\" of egg rolls and only had 2 egg rolls (which hardly qualifies as an order-BTW each egg roll is $2.25 LOL!)  When we called to question our order they said that they didn't add the fried rice, nor did they charge us for it but they offered to deliver an order complimentary since they had screwed up.  Our order for veggie dish, noodle dish, shrimp, chicken dish, pot stickers was over $70 too.  When the delivery lady came she wanted $10, we explained what happened and she said she needed $10 in order to give us the rice.  I asked her what she was going to do with it and she said take it back to the restaurant . . . to reuse in someone else's dish??? IDK, but makes you wonder.  Anyway, needless to say not going back to Rice Inn for the overpriced mediocre food.  Back to the drawing board!"}
{"text":"Solid food, great lunch specials. I have eaten sushi and chinese here and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. The curry was delicious, some of the best Thai food I have ever had!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi and great diversity in the menu. Customer service is wonderful and we always enjoy ourselves when we dine there. It's usually busy and they do a strong take out service as well.  Add this place to your list of local favorites!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and good wait staff. This used to be a pizza hut, and honestly the inside still resembles the former business. The spicy mayo is different from others that I had (a good different), and every roll we got was very good. If you're looking for sushi in Bethel Park I would definitely suggest stopping here."}
{"text":"Great food, polite staff. We get take out from here all the time! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My family always goes to lunch after church, and this is one of the places we go to a lot. Coming here brings back lots of good memories of Sunday lunches with my grandfather before he passed away. That being said, I have not been disappointed yet by a meal I've had here. I've ordered both from the Chinese and Thai sections and always find the dishes flavorful. The hot tea is always good too. I've never ordered sushi here, but my brother always does when we come because he likes it. Just this past Sunday I ordered beef egg foo young, which was my grandfather's go-to meal at any Chinese restaurant, and I was very pleased. The portion size was good (three fairly large patties), and the gravy poured over top was flavorful. In addition to the food, I've also always been satisfied with the service. The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive, so that's another plus in my book. Thanks to Rice Inn for serving good food with good service and helping me to have positive memories with my pap pap (grandfather) to look back on now that he's gone."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped it. Service was very good. Food was okay. I probably won't be back though, there are others that are much better."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually go Chinese atleast a few times a month but this trip was especially disturbing. We are on a tight budget so we went there ate the food, paid for the food and signed a receipt for the food and as we were almost to our car our waitress ran after us asking why we did not leave her a tip. She said she needed a tip for the waitresses and busboys. I have never in my 64 years been shamed into giving a tip before. This waitress literally ran out after us and told us we forgot to leave her a tip. 
Needless to say we will not be going back anytime soon.

{"text":"Fantastic little Asian fusion restaurant in the south hills. Service was great as well as the food and portion size. Don't let the slightly dingy outside appearance fool you. Inside is clean and well kept."}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm pretty picky about Asian food and there's nothing worse than being disappointed! I was hesitant to try Rice Inn because I already had a go to Chinese place, but many friends liked it and I was craving Pad Thai and they had a lunch special that included Pad Thai. I threw caution to the wind and went for it one afternoon for lunch. I ordered both Pad Thai with chicken and a Szechuan Chicken with steamed rice so my dining partner and I could try a little each. 

The portion size was really generous on both. The Pad Thai was a little more saucy than I'm used to and was a different color than I'm accustomed, but it was pretty good and satisfied a craving. The meat was very good. Thinly sliced chicken breast was cooked perfectly. The dish had a pleasant spice level, too. I could have used a little more bean sprouts in the dish, but the snow peas were an interesting addition. 

The Szechuan chicken was also good. Again, great quality meat- no gristle and mystery pieces here! I should have asked about the vegetables that were included because this one had a lot of bell pepper which I don't really care for. That's not their fault, I forgot to ask. There were bamboo shoots and carrots, too. All in all, a good dish. 

I'd definitely go back to try a few other things. They have sushi and a few other Thai offerings, mostly curries. 

The place is a converted Pizza Hut building, and nothing fancy, but it was clean, bustling like you'd hope at lunch time, and very pleasant staff. Easy parking with a parking lot surrounding the building."}
{"text":"So I'm updating my review to say that rice inn is still my favorite place for sushi and Asian cuisine! I've had the chance to try the pad Thai, love! And so many different types of sushi. The rice inn roll, mango roll, and eel roll are 3 of my favorites. Also pictured below! The service is always so friendly, and the prices aren't bad, especially for lunch. I'll be sad when I move out of this neighborhood and no longer have sushi less than a mile from me! Can't wait for my next trip or call in order to rice inn!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I haven't had Rice Inn Delivery since last yr and tonight I had Veggie egg rolls which were loaded and tasted like they were handmade so fresh& tasty!& I had moo shui Shrimp w pancakes so delicious! Fresh have leftovers for tomorrow. They don't disappoint you. Food is great and Ill order again next month- a lunch they give you a-lot of food check it out! Plus only place that delivers to my address- wish others did."}
{"text":"Sorry, I was underwhelmed.

It's not bad, really.  It was clean inside, and the service was really nice.  But our egg rolls were literally dripping oil, like a tablespoon's worth.  Saturated.

My General Tso's Chicken was okay, not bad at all, but didn't really taste like I expected.  It was sweet, not at all spicy, and tasted like a few spices or ingredients were missing.

So, again, this place is not bad, it's not not real good, and I know of better choices."}
{"text":"I had to re-review. I have been back several times since my first review (and often order delivery).  The food was good as usual. The General Tsos is very good, the Hunan chicken was also good, though a by salty. However, I must say that I am not impressed by their new staff. I was very pleased to see that the restaurant was 3/4 full (the busiest I've seen it).  We walked in and the hostess asked if we wanted a table or booth. I requested a booth. We walked to the back (past an empty booth and one that was empty and just needed cleaned) and the hostess turned around and told us that there were no empty booths and we had to sit at a table. I looked to the other side of the restaurant to see at least one more empty booth. She couldn't have missed them, how could she have said that with a straight face?! Was she just trying to get her friend tips by seating us in her section? I just wanted to eat in peace, so didn't challenge her. Our waitress was polite, but inattentive. She disappeared and when she was around she was so quiet that neither of us could hear a word that she was saying. 
The staff has typically been great, but the new additions don't do this place justice.  Seriously, don't tell your customers that there are no empty booths when it is very obviously not true. We aren't stupid."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love the food here!!! Good portions and great taste! The only thing I was not fond of, was our waitress. We brought our 1yo daughter with us, and the waitress never left the table. She played with our daughter the whole time.... I get she was trying to be nice, but After not seeing my boyfriend for so long, it wasn't my ideal date. My daughter ate none of her food because of this."}
{"text":"This has got to be the friendliest place to eat dinner.  I was really impressed by the welcoming smiles and fantastic service.

I am usually a fan of authentic ethnic cuisine, and you can get a little of that here, but what I experienced was great food at a very reasonable price.  The portions are very large and the food is cooked fresh.

I ordered the Szechuan Chicken and it tasted great.  It was a rather Americanized version of the dish, but still really very good.

In most of the reviews of the Rice Inn, they end by saying they will be back.  Now I know why!"}
{"text":"Nice find! My friends in Bethel mentioned this place and we stopped for dinner. We ordered a couple of the sushi rolls and two entrees to share. They are very generous with portions here! Lots of leftovers. I think I ate enough for the entire week. They had a great variety of sushi and the rolls were delicious. Perfect ratios. Service was great. Our server was very friendly and attentive. It seemed like all of the employees there were in an upbeat mood which always makes an experience more enjoyable. I wish I remember which rolls we got but for entrees we got the sesame chicken and I asked for the mixed vegetables to be in a spicy sauce. The sauces on both dishes were perfect. The kind you want to drown your rice in but then you remember you're already stacking up the calories lol. We also got the vegetable lo mein which is probably the best I've had in awhile. I may have to make the drive here to come back because it would be worth it."}
{"text":"Run by fantastic friendly people. We always order takeout from here. They are extremely generous with their portions. We usually get the chicken fried rice and Pad Thai. Every time, the food is packed into plastic containers with leftovers lasting 2 days for 3 people. 

As for the restaurant itself, it's clean, service is fast, and we enjoy taking the family here. 

Food is \"Asian,\" so Chinese, Thai, and Japanese food is on the menu. I recommend the Thai above all else."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst customer service. Ordered plain lomein with soup and egg roll. When it arrived at the table it had steak chicken and shrimp. I am allergic to shell fish. When I told the waitress I did not order this , she continued to argue with me I did. Why would I order something I'm allergic to?! After a bunch or arguing back and forth and her refusing to take my plate back, my grandmother agreed to take my food and I took her chicken lomein. When I got home after lunch, I ended up having a allergic reaction and my throat swelled. This tells me they cross contaminated. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and quick service.  Regardless of how you're supposed to say it, The General Tso is excellent."}
{"text":"Great Asian Fusion restaurant- always clean! We usually get delivery and it's awesome. Our order is always packed nicely and correct. The sushi is really good, and the wonton soup. I think their fried rice is a little bland, but that could just be me. Definitely not cheap, but I'm okay with it because they do a good job with everything. Regardless, still 5 stars for service and consistent quality!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food that I have ever had! Their food is authentic and spiced to perfection. The presentation of the food is spectacular and it tastes just as great. I find that with most Chinese places, if you order chicken, you question whether it is really chicken or not (because there seems to be mush mixed with chicken). But not at this place!! The chicken is cut into thinner pieces and is very crispy. The rice is also moist and sticky. The service is also great! Waiters are easy to understand and are very kind and attentive. This place is, by far, the best Chinese place that I have ever been to. Do NOT be afraid to try it out! You will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Really yummy little find! They have a lot of options, from Chinese to Japanese to Thai. I can't speak for too much on their menu, but they have good sushi and their entrees are delicious. The lo mein is really good and the general tsos was good as well! I had a few of the sushi rolls. The only one I'm not a fan of was the sweet potato tempura roll...it was just cut up sweet potato fries rolled up in some rice and they were really cold. Other than that though, nice little place with good service and very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I just came back from eating at the Rice Inn with my parents.  

In terms of appearance, the restaurant is clean and roomy, which made me feel quite comfortable.  The owners definitely paid attention to the small details from the cute tea cups to the nice placemats.

As for the food, everything that we ordered was delicious.  I really enjoyed the Shanghai bok choy that was lightly sauteed.  As the previous Yelper said, the food was not too greasy.  Also, the flavors fit the taste of my parents, who are originally from Hong Kong and Canton, China.

I would recommend this place to friends and family.  Unfortunately, I live in Boston, so I cannot come as often as I would like.  However, when I do come back, this will be a place I will request to go out for dinner, whenever I come home to visit my parents.

I hope this place does well, as it just opened up.  The owners are very nice people!  

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this place since they opened a couple years ago with my family. I've also brought a few friends here. Sadly, the place has lost quality, quantity, and friendliness... Three attributes that used to make this place my family's favorite dining spot. We would go three times a week some weeks. They used to give enormous portions of everything. Something must have happened because suddenly we would go and we'd get these tiny plates. I used to enjoy their Triple Delight. Then they got extremely stingy with their portions. I would spend over 20 dollars on my meal and leave still hungry. I would tell myself that I am still getting quality food. Then their chicken became more and more fatty and gummy. Then I would go because my family became close to the wait staff and owners. Now I rarely see the owners and all of the waitresses we liked are either gone already or are leaving soon. The current wait staff doesn't know the menu and can't understand English. Plus they have a tendency of being downright rude. 

My family has already jumped ship and we've started giving other places our business."}
{"text":"Rice Inn has a great staff and good food. The prices are good compared to others in the area. There sushi is good and if you order it to go they even put it on ice to be sure its fresh."}
{"text":"We stopped in for early dinner. Everything was great. I had General Tso Shrimp. Very good and big portion. Kids portions are large. Plenty for them, too. We had shrimp tempura roll and Rock&Roll - both were great!"}
{"text":"This probably seems like \"great Asian\" to those who don't often leave the burbs in search of truly great Asian. That being said, it's not bad and the place is clean. Workers are friendly. I won't say I'd never eat there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. We had red curry shrimp and basil shrimp both with fried rice. Both were fine."}
{"text":"Food is good and staff is very nice and inviting.  Between Rice Inn and Silk Road, the South Hills is a hotbed for asian cuisine."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here, first time trying it. I have to be honest while they were very friendly and the food was ready fairly quickly, I wasn't impressed. We had a curry dish and a noodle dish and both were super bland, for the $40 it cost for 2 dishes I didn't feel it was worth it. Curries are usually full of flavor, this just lacked any real taste. The noodles were dry and bland and everything seemed steamed without any seasoning. Little disappointing."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Rice Inn several times and have never had anything that wasn't incredible. The General Tso's chicken is my favorite, but the Pad Thai is to die for. One of my favorite things about Rice Inn is that they deliver locally, and the food doesn't have that \"been sitting in the car for half an hour\" taste. It tastes as fresh as if it was right from the kitchen even when delivered. They are also BYOB so you could bring a six-pack? or a bottle of wine to the restaurant. The crab rangoons are also a staple. One thing to consider if you've never eaten here are the portions - they are gigantic. Myself, my wife, and both my parents recently ate from one portion of General Tso's chicken and were all satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I had the Seafood Supreme & it was great. My wife had the Spicy Shrimp & Scallops & I think her's was better than mine.

Full menu + a small sushi bar. No bar, but you can BYOB if you wish.

Very clean & roomy. We will be back, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I can't believe this used to be a Pizza Hut. Awesome service and food. I loved the sushi, but especially their Honey Walnut Shrimp. The food is a mixture of Thai, Japanese, and Chinese. It's near a strip mall, so there's lots of parking."}
{"text":"I moved to Bethel Park 7 months ago, and I was disappointed to not have a good chinese delivery place... until I found Rice Inn! The General Tso's tofu is the best I have ever had, and I've enjoyed everything except for the Thai dishes (the veggies were uncooked- I believe most Thai places cook their foods for a while instead of the way Chinese places \"flash fry\" stuff. Regardless, this is now my go-to place for Chinese delivery! They are super fast too."}
{"text":"I have a simple litmus test for Chinese restaurants, and it comes as a result of my 30 years of experience of eating at Chinese restaurants all over the U.S. (mainly California) and in mainland China.  My test?  \"Kung Pao Chicken.\"  It's always the first thing I try at a Chinese restaurant, because I have experienced Kung Pao Nirvana, and I have had way too many disappointments.  A disappointing Kung Pao experience usually leads to \"no second chance\" from me because there are choices one can make.

When I saw the \"grand opening\" signs for Rice Inn at the old Pizza Hut location next to Walmart in Bethel Park, I didn't want to get my hopes up.  I actually waited until I saw a couple of Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews before I decided to get my dining partner to join me for a meal there.  (you can't be too careful these days...)  My first impression was, \"HEY, they've actually dressed up this old Pizza Hut pretty well!\"  They even managed to do something with those weird trapezoid Pizza Hut windows that we all know and love.  The place was simply decorated, and was very inviting to the first-time guest.  (maybe the odd familiarity added to that?)  Comfortable seating, low noise level, attentive hostess (who turned out to be the manager) and an eager young waiter all made us feel good about our choice to try Rice Inn from the very start.

The first thing we noticed on the menu were the letters \"BYOB.\"  We immediately sent our young accomplice to the nearby Giant Eagle to procure some bottles for us.  I simply love the whole BYOB concept, especially when there is no \"corkage\" fee.  Upon opening the menu, I was impressed with the depth that it contained, and since I had read that this new restaurant had good sushi, I ordered the \"Baked Alaska Roll\" as an appetizer.  I am unable to resist any roll that has smoked salmon on it, and this one did not disappoint.  It was expertly prepared, very well presented, and the ingredients seemed fresh and tasted delicious.  The only bad part was that it was cut into 8 pieces and there were 3 of us, so I had to graciously (and reluctantly) deny myself a third piece!  This was an odd roll, because as the name implied, it was served warm.  But I really, really liked it, and so did my compatriots. (who got 3 pieces, unlike me...)

I was feeling great about this place almost immediately because we got to watch the sushi chef prepare our roll, and we got to drink exactly the beer that we wanted (Yakima Glory) instead of settling for the usual run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant offering.  We decided to try a nice cross-section from the menu to find out where the strengths and weakness might be.

We ordered a seafood soup for two, an order of Kung Pao chicken with fried rice (only 75 cents to upgrade from the steamed rice) and an order of Pad Thai, of which we are huge fans.

In a word, the Kung Pao chicken was \"perfect.\"  This is the dish that always lights me up when it is done correctly, and the kitchen at RICE INN nailed this one.  Tender, perfectly cooked chicken, crispy texture in the vegetables and nuts, and a sauce that was exactly what I was hoping for.  A++ and the best I've had in the South Hills of Pittsburgh.  The seafood soup got a B minus.  Everything was in there as advertised, and nothing in the soup was overdone or tough.  Obviously the kitchen used fresh ingredients.  But personally, I thought that the soup itself was somewhat lacking in seasoning and overall seafood taste.  This may be a personal taste thing, but I wasn't that excited about the soup.  My friends, however, enjoyed it more than I.  As for the Pad Thai, it was not what I was expecting.  I have had a lot of GREAT Pad Thai lately because this is one of the major strengths of one of my favorite restaurants located a few miles up the road on 88.  This Pad Thai needed to go back to the drawing board, in my opinion.  The shrimp was tender enough, and the rice noodles were just about right, but the seasoning of this dish just didn't do justice to the Pad Thai tradition.  After offering some feedback to our young and enthusiastic waiter, \"Morgan,\" I wouldn't be surprised if the chef made some adjustments on this particular menu offering.  It's hard to do EVERYTHING well, and since this place has only been in business for a month, I'll expect some improvements on this one.

My overall impression could be summed up in these words:  \"Do you have any TO-GO menus?\"  I will definitely be coming back to RICE INN to explore the menu further and find out what other offerings on the menu are \"in their wheelhouse.\"  It will not surprise me to find out that they do a lot of things well, based on this first visit.

I'd also like to make mention of the fact that the hostess who turned out to be the manager listened to the feedback we gave our young waiter on the food we were served, and she unhesitatingly removed the cost of the Pad Thai from our bill without any suggestion from us.  I really respect this desire to please!"}
{"text":"The food was served at room temperature, which was disappointing and the service was very slow. Unfortunate, because the flavor of the food was good, although my husband said his meal wasn't as he would have liked."}
{"text":"Pros: typical suburban Chinese food if that's what you're into 

Cons: $12.95 for a dinner portion of anything....only comes with small white rice"}
{"text":"Five of us (two adults and three teenagers) ordered takeout from the Rice Inn. We ordered four meals and one appetizer, and the portions were enormous! The food was very good, and there were leftovers for the next day. While we didn't dine in, we were impressed by the interior of the restaurant (very clean and inviting), and think the next time we will dine in and sit at the sushi bar. Service was extremely friendly and fast. I did note that the restaurant is BYOB, with a cork fee, but that's just an FYI. Overall, we enjoyed the food a lot, and we will eat there again."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to the Rice Inn.  We can't wait to return to dine in and take out, too!  My green curry dish was the best I've had (I've eaten at many Thai restaurants)! Our server was very helpful and attentive.  This restaurant is a 10!  I am so excited to have such a yummy restaurant in Bethel Park!  We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Love love love this hidden gem. The guy with the glasses who makes the sushi makes it better than Nakama. Dinner portions are enough for two, service is bare able depending on who you get. Well worth every penny, best in town :)"}

{"text":"I stop here every now and again for lunch after working out at Healthtrax, which is just around the bend and up the hill from the shopping center that Rice Inn is located in.  I hadn't been here in a really long time, so I decided to stop in today for lunch.  Formerly a Pizza Hut, it is now an Asian restaurant with Chinese, Sushi, and Thai.  I always get the Thai lunch special, and always the same one, Green Curry Vegetables.  You get a choice of soup or an eggroll, and I always get the veggie egg roll.  I like the green curry, and the purple eggplants that are in it are my favorite part of the dish.  It also has green beans, carrots, broccoli, a few jalapenos, and fresh basil.  Is it the best I have ever had?  No, not even close, but it is fine for what it is, and the staff here are always very friendly.  And lunch is just under $10."}
{"text":"This place better never close. Its my whole family's favorite place to eat. We've tried many items, but my favorite so far is the triple delight. Steak (real steak, slightly rare in the middle), chicken, and shrimp. Perfectly cooked vegetables (pea pods, baby corn, broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, cabbage).  And their cheese filled wontons(crab Rangoon)..amazing!

The amazing chicken, general tsos, and sesame chicken all blow Sesame Inn out of the water.  And its not as pricy. 

We used to have to drive all the way out to bean curd in McMurray for decent Chinese. So happy we have rice inn now. (Plus our favorite bean curd waiter works here too!)

They get to know their regulars and anticipate your order. Love their servers!

EDITING TO ADD: the Pad Thai is addictive!! I've ordered it the past 3 times and keep going back for it. New favorite. :)."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for sushi and Chinese food. I think the sushi is better than the meals though so this is my preference when I come. They are located in the plaza with Giant Eagle and Walmart on Library Road in Bethel Park. The building is actually an old Pizza Hut. Staff is always friendly and the restaurant is very clean. It's never been crowded when I've been there but I've never gone on a Friday or Saturday night. There's several TVs and small sushi counter for seating too. Prices are very inexpensive, especially for lunch! I'll be back for more sushi!"}
{"text":"The Rice Inn was an outstanding restaurant when they first opened, not so much anymore! I gave them three shots at getting it right and they failed each time. General Tso's Chicken had so many hot peppers in it that it wasn't edible..I love hot food but this was really overwhelming.  The Szechuan Shrimp was equally as hot on another order and tonight I played it safe and ordered Shrimp Chop Suey..mostly broccoli on the veggie part and the sauce was watery like soup..Don't think I'll be ordering takeout from there anymore!  On the upside their Sushi is exceptionally good according to my Sushi loving husband. Guess he will be dining alone if he wants Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Dined in once and had delivery later in the week. Pad Thai is superb and General's chicken is just as good.  The green curry was flavorful, but had an over-abundance of eggplant for my personal taste.  B.P. residents need to stop driving past this restaurant - don't judge the old Pizza Hut building/exterior.  Trust us, you'll soon be a fan of the restaurant's quality"}
{"text":"We had heard that this restaurant was good and their parking lot is always full so today my family tried it. 
We were seated quickly because we got there right when it opened. Our waitress brought out drinks and took our orders as the place started to fill up. They had a nice sushi selection but because it was so cold outside we all were looking for warmth, we all ordered entrees. 
I ordered Happy Family (16.95) that had lobster, scallops, shrimp, chicken, beef and vegetables in a brown sauce. It was good but seemed a it salty to me. It was a huge portion and I only managed to eat half. 
My youngest son ordered Triple Delight (13.95). It had shrimp, chicken, beef, and vegetables. He cleaned his plate. He probably would have licked it had I allowed him. 
My husband ordered Hunan Shrimp (12.95). It was spicy but no overly so. He too cleaned his plate. 
My oldest son (who currently recovering from a tonsillectomy) had a bowl of egg drop soup and a bowl of rice. It would be kind of hard to mess up those things. 
We definitely will be back. I would like to try their sushi and other items on their menu. The most important thing to know is that it's BYOB."}
{"text":"I love the Rice Inn, great Chinese and Thai food and don't miss the sushi bar. Attentive staff and the meals are moderately priced. This place is a must try for Thai food lovers!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place. Somehow the ambience inside gives a feeling of intimacy. The tables and table settings are a cut above most nice chain-type restaurants without becoming formal.  I had cashew chicken, admittedly a safe choice, and it tasted good and was a good portion.  We also got a California roll appetizer, and split it among us.  This was real good, I think next time I will order something Japanese."}
{"text":"If there is one word that describes Rice Inn (412.835.2800), a converted Pizza Hut, it is casual, casual, casual.  The tone is set by the young hostess, who was dressed for the beach: a hooded sweatshirt, seersucker shorts, and flat canvas shoes.  If one is seeking ambiance, this is not the place, though it is reasonably attractive and comfortable, and the tables and booths allow plenty of space to relax.

Diners may bring their own alcohol and there appears to be no corkage fee for wine.  

The restaurant became extremely loud as the evening went on as some of the diners overindulged in wine.

The restaurant is in its first few weeks of operation, and it shows.

Our harried, but pleasant young female server forgot our request for water and hot tea.  After fifteen minutes, we received water after asking a second time. She was apologetic.  Later in the meal, a refill was provided without our having to ask.  We did not receive the tea.

My wife ordered a sushi platter with salad and miso soup with seaweed.  The good-sized salad with iceberg lettuce, carrots, and tasty ginger dressing arrived twenty minutes after the dinner order was placed, the soup a few minutes later. The sushi was brought to the table several minutes before my hot items. There were eighteen pieces in this large platter of sushi, which she enjoyed, a bargain for $10.95.

I ordered chicken egg roll ($1.95), chow fun noodles with pork (a flat, wide egg noodle) (yes, very unhealthful: a splurge), $9.00, and tofu (bean curd) with mixed vegetables: broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas ($8.95). The egg roll came within a few minutes of ordering, but  it was a vegetable roll, not the chicken variety I had ordered.  Instead of asking me whether I wanted the vegetable roll, the server instructed me to eat it and that she would order the chicken roll.  I did as she directed and consumed both.  Neither was particularly tasty and both were served lukewarm, at best.  Both of the entrees were a good portion, tasty, and served in delicious sauces: not too oily, but the tofu dish was drowning in the sauce, causing it to be soggy. Both dishes were the proper temperature: steaming hot.  Neither of the large platters was brought with any serving utensil.

Although the take-out menu shows an American Express icon in the section where accepted credit cards are listed, the server told me that the restaurant does not accept it.

I understand the husband and wife owners, Mr. and Mrs. Ho, are lovely people, but they were apparently not present on this evening.  No owner or manager was overseeing the dining room and no one other than the server checked on us.

In most respects, I compare Rice Inn unfavorably to my favorite Asian restaurant in the area, Red Tea House in the Virginia Manor Shops in Mount Lebanon.  Red Tea House is somewhat more expensive and the portions are somewhat smaller, but it consistently offers great service and artistically-presented cuisine, ambiance, and top-notch management, which oversees the dining room and makes every guest feel welcome. Water and tea are not ever forgotten at Red Tea House because these items are brought when the server first approaches the customer, along with delicious crisp noodles (alas, also unhealthful.)

For value, convenience, and reasonably good food, I am likely to return to Rice Inn on occasion, but it is not at the top of my list.

The restaurant also offers Thai cuisine, including the famous Pad Thai.  It maintains no website and does not advertise."}
{"text":"Their customer service was excellent, so I really do not want to give a bad review, BUT... Frankly their food is not that good. I don't even know if you can call it Americanized Chinese food. The biggest problem I had was the complete lack of spice in the dishes marked as spicy. They tasted SWEET more than anything. And while their portions are huge, they aren't cheap by any means. As I mentioned, they are really friendly though, and since the place seems fairly kids-friendly, I might eat there every once in a while regardless."}
{"text":"Yelpers brought me here. Thanks!

The sushi didn't disappoint. I love Ikura fish eggs! The waitress recommended it as sashimi (no rice) instead of sushi (on rice), so I went with her suggestion. It came in a cute little cucumber cup!

The Thai dishes could definitely be spicier. I asked for very spicy Mussaman curry--a 7 out of 10, and requested extra spice on the side. She said it's incorporated in the dish, so there wasn't an option for the spice to be on the side. It came out as a huge portion with red pepper flakes, but there was absolutely no spice in this chicken curry ): 
It might have scored it a 2/10 on the spice scale. On the bright side, It had plenty of flavor from the curry sauce, the green beans, potatoes, onions, and pineapples.

Brown rice was an extra 50 cents, which is cheap compared to the +$2 markup at other restaurants. 

I was looking for dinner in the area, and I found Rice Inn through Yelp. It's a little out of the way for me, so I might not get a chance to come back-- but I'd recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst so called \"Chinese\" / \"Thai\" I have ever had. The quality of the food was very poor and not well tasting at all. The only good thing about it was the price. Five meals for $45. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"\"No, that couldn't be,\" I said to myself earlier in the year when I noticed that the Bethel Park Pizza Hut had been converted into... an Asian restaurant? That would mean...sushi in Bethel Park??? 

2 nights ago on dreaded Black Friday, Kay and I were driving along cozy Library Road aimlessly when I suddenly remembered that relatively recent development and charged forward. 

Like Bigfoot, Kay didn't believe it existed.

\"It used to be a Pizza Hut?\" she asked with the tone of a skeptical police officer interrogating a UFO eyewitness. 

\"Yes! Keep going! It's there! It's there! I know I saw it! I read reviews on Yelp,\" I replied.

\"What's the name again?\" she inquired. 

\"Rice Inn.\"

\"Ricin? Eeeeww. That's a poison!\"

\"Oh, stop.\"

\"Well, they at least better be open or else...it's a date with The Redhead,\" Kay coldly promised. 

Sure enough at 8PM on a weekend, Rice Inn's doors were unlocked. The interiors are sparse but tasteful with vibrant, upside down glasses housing the light bulbs. Bourdain's new CNN program was running on a flatscreen telly near a sushi bar. 

A complimentary serving of Edamame was the precursor to our supper. Salted and bulbous, I'd never had these soybeans served to me in this manner before. At first I ate them whole! That is until I realized that I had better tasting results when I popped open each pod to get at the nutty, wholesome beans within. 

I officially began my journey into the inexplicable with a pair of Uni or Sushi with Sea Urchin for the novices among thee. The quivering, ornately presented cylinders of seaweed, rice, and a paste-like roe were bedecked with fanned cucumber. When placed whole in my mouth, what I tasted amidst each opulent morsel's inherently sensual texture were the faint whispers of caviar, foie gras, oyster, and thus...the ocean. This wasn't an appetizer; this was a seduction. The glob of wasabi remained untouched, but the flower of shaved, pickled ginger (I've a soft spot for it) I ate only after I finished the sushi. 

6 swelling, humongous fried pork dumplings came next. Abundant with ground meat filling and golden brown on the outside, had I not shared them with Kay, I could have made them my entree. The balls of savory minced pig stayed within each potsticker, which required knife, fork, and at least two bites to consume wholly. In all seriousness, Rice Inn's dumplings are the largest specimen of this perennial Chinese favorite I've ever experienced, and they alone make a trek to the far South Hills worthwhile. 

Based solely on its fanciful, poetic name, I chose a main dish that fell under the Thai heading. Dancing Seafood Supreme was composed of jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, crabmeat, tomatoes, onion, peppers, carrot, basil, and \"chef's special spicy Thai chili sauce\" as stated in the pamphlet I took home. The sauce was only warmly spicy and never overthrew the majesty that was the pleasingly plump and abundant bits of crustacean and mollusk. The tatty and tart tomato pieces were a welcome surprise and fleetingly fooled me into thinking I was eating an Italian stew made with the day's fresh catch. 

After barely finishing each of our big-hearted portions, we bade our trusty server Celine along with the rest of the buoyant staff farewell and headed back home without having bought a single damn thing on this damnably consumerist holiday other than a wondrous Asian supper at a family-owned establishment."}
{"text":"So I just moved to bethel park not too long ago and had no idea where to get Chinese ! Taking a shot in the dark I ordered Rice Inn ! I must say I was not disappointed . The food is beyond delicious and the staff is always so nice ... in addition to the Chinese , they also have great sushi and Thai food as well. The spicy Thai basil is my favorite ."}
{"text":"As the comments indicate, don't be fooled by the outside. Good food, nice inside and good service so step inside and enjoy like I did for lunch today."}
{"text":"Great food!  Their orange beef is really good, as is most all of their menu.  So, so, so much better than all the small take out places in the area.  When we have company, this is the place we always take them for dinner."}
{"text":"I go here quite often for both lunch and dinner, because I work at the GE nearby. Very friendly place, and they get to know their regulars. Prices are reasonable and the food is fresh. I hope it never closes. I plan on being a regular customer for a long time. Every time I go, I try to have something new. I recommend anything on their menu, you can't go wrong with anything on it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. My boyfriend hates Chinese but he loves to come here with me and get General Tso's chicken. Their Sushi rolls are beyond phenomenal. I could stuff myself for hours on just the sushi here. I am so glad they made this old Pizza Hut into an awesome Chinese sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times I was very pleased with my meal and the customer service. They have a very nice selection of sushi and sashimi (sea urchin is on the menu for all of you who love it but have a hard time finding it in the area!) along with traditional Chinese take-out dishes and a few Thai options. I wish they would have some authentic drinks like bubble tea or maybe some more options for hot tea.
Overall though no complaints about the food or customer service! I will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here earlier this evening and it was wonderful. The red chicken curry was really good! Just the right amount of spice and sweet coconut flavor. The veggies where lightly cooked just how I like them and you could tell that they were fresh. Delicious! 

Their staff is very friendly and helpful. The owner Jessie is a sweet heart. I hope their business continues to do well and stays in business so I will always have a great place to go for a Thai fix."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. I love that they offer Thai as well as sushi. Eat in or take out - always completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Really nice people. 

Now the food. I liked what I ate but I didn't know if I was in a Thai, Chinese, Japanese or whatever restaurant. Totes confused.

Also, it's BOYB so there's a cork fee. That's fine but there were 6 of us. We had three bottles (one was just a beer), and we got THREE CORK fees. Ugh. You should charge one cork fee per table!

I did like the General Tso's but my friend's didn't like the Pad Thai at all."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and have received a slight headache after.  Never thought too much about it until last night.  I got a migraine so bad that I was seeing spots.  What does that tell me?  MSG.

For the over priced food that we receive - I have never seen a mention on the menu that says - \"hey we use MSG\".  Needless to say I will not be eating here again.

Food is ok - nothing to miss ever having again.

Beware this restaurant uses MSG."}
