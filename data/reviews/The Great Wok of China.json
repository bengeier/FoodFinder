{"text":"Great standby takeout. Quick, fresh, and tasty. Bring cash. 

Attended a large group party here for a 10 (?) course family style lunch, and it was also pretty good despite the dated decor. I also overlooked this restaurant for years, but glad to see them still open."}
{"text":"New to the area & read the review & we decided to try this place out. We called in our order for takeout. They tell us 20 minutes, perfect. We get there and they tell us our order isnt ready yet....alright. So we wait. and wait. and wait. People are coming in and getting their food and we're still waiting. 20 minutes later they realize that they never put our order threw. So they offer us a seat at the table while we waited. Took 45 minutes to get our food and they didn't even offer anything extra or discount or anything. The food itself was alright. Nothing too great. Kind of greasy, but I suppose thats to be expected. Good Prices, terrible service."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup in Toronto!  This is a must try if you go here.  The wontons have the right texture and there's something really delicious about the broth as well.

Overall a good experience.  For the amount of food we ordered it was really affordable as well...  ~38 CAD for a soup, egg rolls and 3 entrees for 3 people."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese food place in Mississauga.  My family have been going for years and I've always had a great experience.  The food tastes great!"}
{"text":"We ordered a wide variety of dishes from this restaurant for 5 people. The food arrived quickly and exactly as we ordered it. The food was still steaming hot when we were serving it. Everything was delicious. I was truly impressed by the amount of chicken they put in their chicken balls unlike most places who usually have a small morsel and a ton of batter... this was a generous portion with a thin batter coating. The sweet and sour sauce is the best I have tasted. The lemon chicken terrific. All were very happy with their meals. To top it off, it was reasonably priced. I would strongly recommend ordering from this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Chinese.  Fresh and friendly.  I love the Cantonese chow mien as well as the chicken balls.  Interior design is old, but the food and service make up for it."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about as this place is just mediocre.  We got the following for take-out a few weeks ago:

Cantonese Chow Mein - noodles weren't crispy and lacked a lot of the nice vegetables and seafood like a good traditional Chinese restaurant would provide;

Chicken with Hot Chili Bean Sauce - a few pieces of chicken but mostly big chunks of onion and green pepper and not a whole lot of flavor;

Pork Fried Rice - not bad but didn't have any peas or onions, just rice and pork;

Salt and Pepper Squid - it was tasty and well prepared but I've better;

Spicy Hunan Beef - best dish we ordered, very fresh and flavorful but could have done without the big chunks of onion; and

Anyway, good size portions and the price wasn't too bad but I wouldn't be in a hurry to order again."}
{"text":"It's typical Chinese-American food at its typicalist. And yes I just made up that word for this review! I really don't understand how this place could receive anything more or less than 3 stars. It's good, not great. It's not exactly cheap, but no complaints."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place. Decent food. If I'm at this mall again, I could see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"I resisted going to this restaurant for years for no real reason other than the fact that it's in a crappy little mall. I was wrong and now I am kicking myself for missing out on it for the last 6 years. 
I'm making up for it now! Their prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and delicious.
I've had one of their dinners for one that had sweet & sour chicken balls (crispy, not too battered, excellent), chicken chow mein (large good pieces of white chicken), and plain fried rice (surprisingly good for being 'plain') along with an eggroll (probably the weakest link but still very very good).
The staff are incredibly friendly and I kinda like the 80's decor in the restaurant. I wish I could identify even one of the autographed headshots on the wall, but that's part of the charm.
Don't be like me and avoid this place because of it's appearance. Never judge a book by it's cover!"}
{"text":"There isn't anything special about the food. But I'm glad I tried it. The service was good."}
{"text":"I actually like this place a lot lately, take out is all I do. they never messed up my order so far, always take care of my special instructions on my order. They are quick and the food is good"}
{"text":"I expect fake processed meat in my Subway \"grilled chicken\" sandwich, but not at a real restaurant. This http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai407e/ai407e16.htm is what they're passing off as chicken. Beware."}
{"text":"I was in the area and didn't have lunch yet so I decided to pay The Great Wok of China a visit for some takeout.

There are 2 entrances: 1 from within the mall and 1 outside facing the parking lot.

They accept credit cards, but for takeout orders of $15 or lower, they only take debit and/or cash.

The interior resembled the old Chinese places I used to visit as a kid with friends/family. I liked the feeling of nostalgia but others would say its outdated and in need of a renovation.

I ordered the Honey & Garlic Chicken Balls, and the Beef Ho Fun with Black Pepper Sauce. No complaints on the food I ordered.

The staff was very nice & service was faster than I thought.

I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
