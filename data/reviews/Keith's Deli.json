{"text":"I made a point to stop at Keith's because of the reviews I read on Yelp. Sadly, my experience wasn't as great as the other reviewers. Three people in front of me ordered the famous Keith Special, which turns out to be a pork sausage with BBQ sauce if I remember correctly. I'm not a huge fan of pork sausage, so I ordered the Turkey Sandwich. The sandwich came with cheese, lettuce, mayo and mustard, with an option to substitute the mustard with cranberry sauce. It was Keith's 40th anniversary, so sandwiches were $1 off and came with a bag of chips.  I'll give the sandwich points for the bread being super fresh and soft, but otherwise it fell flat. There was about 2 thin slices of deli turkey, a couple shreds of iceberg lettuce and bland cheese. Thank goodness for the bread or I would have been starving after. It's nice that a small mom and pop place can stick around for so long, especially in Calgary, but I think this is my first and only visit to Keith's."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for a small price.  They make their own sausages every Monday and their buns are delivered fresh every morning by a local bakery. The sandwiches seem like they aren't much at first glance, a small (6\") bun, lettuce, mustard, mayo, cheese and deli meat, warmed up and melty. BUT, you can get a large version of every sandwich that gives you double the meat OR you can \"Keith-ify\" your sandwich by adding a sausage to it. The turkey sandwich comes with cranberry sauce. Yum!  This is one of my favorite places to go on a Saturday for a quick, easy lunch."}
{"text":"I've been going to Keith's for years. I love the Keith's special. Sausage made right there. I have never had a soup from there I haven't liked. The chowders are amazing. The service is great too!!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm had the turkey with double meat. Yummy. Will be back for sure. Hubby had pizza type sub. Very delicious. He said next time he will get sausage on it too. Only complaint was no high chairs for our baby."}
{"text":"Keith's Deli has been in Calgary for decades and it still serves delicious sandwiches and sausages for a good price. At lunch expect a short wait in line before getting your fill. The hours seem a little random to me and I have on a few occasions been disappointed to find them closed at odd times of the day. Try the special."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the last few months. Every time is always as good as before :) Friendly people, and AMAZING food."}
{"text":"good independent sandwich shop!   this cozy little sandwich shop is a refreshing change from the typical shops in the calgary dining scene which have not uniqueness or history. I think keith's has been in operation for about 40 years (?) and you can find 3 or 4 generations of the family working at any given time! The sandwiches are good, but simple - in fact, you can make the same sandwich at home using stuff bought from the grocery store. still, it's a nice place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"I have also been going to Keith's off and on since his days in the old Chinook Mall next to the ALCB liquor store. Back then he was doing groundbreaking stuff with his sandwiches and garlic sausage. His sausage Daily Deal sandwich was always a hit. He moved to a new location across Macleod Trail from Chinook about 20 years ago. I also moved and left Calgary in 2001 but have stopped at Keith's now and again while I was in town. The last time was a huge disappointment. The lackluster bread choices, lack if filling and high prices turned me off for good. He only takes cash but does have a non-working ATM machine in the shop. In this day you have to at least offer Debit sales to customers. There are so many other food options within a short walk from Keith's I am sad that it has come to this. I have no idea if Keith himself is still involved as he must be a tad long in the tooth by now but if he is, then he should know better and offer better value to his customers."}
{"text":"Yum. Walked in and Im sure it was Keith working the counter. The sign on the wall says Keith's 45th Anniversary was in April. Gotta love how some places can survive the times-and economy. That has to mean something. So 'Keith' as I assumed asked if we wanted to try his in house made sausage. Sure--- why not. It was lean and flavourful. So I figured - why not. Keith Special is the regular sausage. KeithItalian is the sausage with cayenne and spices. Hubs had the Keith Special, I had the KeithItalian. Yummy. Warm, with cheese and served on a warm bun. So I get the 45 years in business. Yummy. Simply and $7 a sandy. We'll be back."}
{"text":"So good. First time here and worth it! Keith's special sandwich perfect simple lunch."}
{"text":"Really cute little deli across from Chinook Mall. After a long afternoon of Christmas shopping, my boyfriend wanted to take me here for a bite, as it's a long time favourite of his. It doesn't look like much from the outside (and I'll be honest - I was a little hesitant) but he ordered us two Keith's Specials, so we grabbed two bottles of pop and had a seat. The service was amazing! The lady working the front counter was so friendly and sweet! It wasn't very busy so we decided to stay and eat, and I really enjoyed my sandwich. The place had a ton of cool stuff on the walls and it felt like there was a lot of history there. It wasn't anything crazy, but it was delicious. I left there a big fan and will definitely make it a point to stop here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years now and I absolutely love it. I'll be honest, I've only ever ordered the Keith's Special but that's because I crave it. My husband has tried plenty of sandwiches and always likes them. Service is very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"There are local spots that just scream Calgary and Keith's is among the loudest. To be straight up, I haven't tried 90% of their menu. This isn't because I've only been there a couple of times. In fact, I've been there over 100 times. My issue is that the second I tried the Keitalian I didn't want to try anything else. If their other sandwiches are even half as good, then one day I may have to expand my taste. My only warning to new patrons would be they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Hidden inside the Chinook Plaza (I believe it is called) directly across from Chinook Center, this small deli delights with their sandwiches and hand-made sausages. I tried the Rachel (ham, sauerkraut and cheese), and it is a melty delight: add in a special sausage on the side and you are going to be quite full from your lunch. Two minor quibbles: minus half a point for only accepting cash, and another half for the use of the mysterious powers of the microwave, and you have an overall solid deli that is a Calgary institution - or at least should be!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here all the time, at least once a week! We always order the same thing: a turkey sandwich on brown with no mustard, a Keith's sausage cut up into slices, and a small bowl of soup.  They always have the yummiest home made soups! Today we have a ham & potato soup, mmmmm it was divine :) Not only is the food great, it's affordable and the staff here always seem to remember our order. So good!"}
