{"text":"After drinking probably 12 seagrams on the rocks, my hunger got to me.  I already had a footlong hotdog with chili, but my body was screaming for more food.  I went to the pizza shop and ordered some kind of spicy pizza.  Wasn't feeling it and no I'm not a pizza snob, far from it, I love Totino's frozen pizza for god's sake, but this pizza was probably top 5 of crappy pizza.  The only good thing about it was that it lured me away from the tables long enough to stop giving the casino all of my money.  My advice, stick to the $1.99 footlong hotdogs"}
{"text":"Went to this place with a goal of pizza that would satisfy my tourist stomach. Arrived to the gates of
Hell known as noble romans ordered a pizza and wings thinking life would be good. Not only was the food like $25 for a small pizza and wings they had no place to sit down except a small table big enough for a plate. The lady working there through the food in a microwave and tossed it out in like a minute. The food tasted like rats. I'd rather eat rocks than eat this trash you've been warned"}
{"text":"We were starving and looking for an affordable dinner.  We figured a pizza could not hurt us financially.  Our specialty pizza was made fresh....waited about 10-15min.  The pizza was not bad but sort of cold, considering they made it fresh.   The BBQ wings also came out fresh.  The wings were more like baked style rather than deep fried.  So they were not so crispy but rather soft.  We paid about $26 for a large specialty pizza, 10pc wings and 3 bottles of water.  If you are looking for an affordable junk food on The Strip, besides McDonald's, this would be an option.  Overall, it was not bad."}
{"text":"Quickly trying to get ready to go out and desperately in need of fast food led me to go to Noble Roman's Pizza inside Casino Royale. I only ate here because I stayed there. I got a individual pepperoni pizza combo which came with a drink and breadsticks and dip for like $8. Damn, pretty expensive but I was hungry and it did the trick. Unfortunately, I think I ate too much bread because I kept drinking and I think the bread just kept absorbing the alcohol! Haha."}
{"text":"Maybe it is just because we don't have any Noble Roman's Pizzas in southern California and therefore eating at one is a special experience for me that I associate with fun times, but I really enjoy eating at Noble Roman's when I am in Las Vegas. Their pizza is good fast food pizza. The crust isn't exactly thin crust, but it is thinner than Pizza Hut's regular hand tossed. It is better than Pizza Hut or any of the other big chains. Their pizza boxes have so much printing on them, including a big paragraph about why you shouldn't turn the box upside down on the bottom of the box. This Noble Roman's is next to a Subway and a Chipotle, Panda Express, and McDonalds are next door. Even with all those choices I chose to eat at Noble Roman's. Like I said, part of it may just be because of the novelty for me and someone from somewhere else might find Chipotle more unique.

This location is very tiny. Honestly you could probably only fit two people in there. Casino Royale is expanding and I think they will soon be moving to a larger location at the back of the casino with more seating area. This is a fast food location similar to Pizza Hut Express so it has a limited menu. On the plus side, they do usually have some personal size pizzas ready to go. Cash only."}
{"text":"The works-bad. So salty and oily. I guess it's not the restaurant's fault since pepperoni and Italian sausage are just like that."}
{"text":"Located in the back of Casino Royale is not a bad place of semi, do not expect anything extraordinary, decent priced (compared to everything else close by on the strip) pizza, breadsticks and wings.

The value meals are the best deals to purchase. 

The breadsticks (finger looking, semi cooked, over baked) are just nourishment, a filler.

The cheese on the pizza, was super buttery, gooey and yummy. The crust was semi brunt but edible. 

Remember, this is drunk food. The taste is dependent upon the levels of alcohol that has been consumed. The sausage pizza (buttery cheese makes this awesome) is actually delicious. The dough and marinara not so much as awesome.

Bruce Lee was not only friendly but so especially handsome. Thanks for serving me. Hope to see you again. This would have been 2 stars but Bruce Lee turned this into 3 star review."}
{"text":"It's pizza, like just boring ole pizza....but cmon now, charging $3.19 for a bottle of water!!!! For .80 more you can get a beer at the bar!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Based on Rand's recommendation I stopped here for a foot long hot dog at the exorbitant (lol) price of $1.99.  The hot dog compared in value to the $1.50 one at Chase field and it was ok.  Did not help that the attendants got sort of grumpy when I asked them to put some onions at the condiment station."}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick bite and stopped by this place. I was not too happy- I paid $8 for a slice of pizza and a drink and the pizza was not very good. It seemed to lack good tomato sauce and I think that's what made it so bland. It is located right on the strip, so I'm sure thats why it was more pricey."}
{"text":"Airline food is better. Oops, I forgot, airlines no longer serve food. This place blows. Point made."}
{"text":"Foot long hot dog with chili, jalapenos and onions for 2 bucks. Loved it! Perfect cheap eats when  hammerosis has set in."}
{"text":"Trust me as an ex-employee of Scott Hansen you guys are eating all kinds of bacteria and mold. He hires ex cons and kids to save money and barely passes his health inspections. Any health inspector that passes Scotty \"Beans\" Hansen is out of their mind. I've worked many restaurants but nothing as dirty as this guys establishments. I've found crickets in Chicken I'm not \"allowed\" to throw out because Scotty \"Beans\" Hansen doesn't throw ANYTHING out, but trust me, when I was cooking it wasn't getting served. Not surprised to read his ratings at all. Funny"}
{"text":"I think this place owns the hot dog place, which makes sense.  No one seemed to really like the pizza, and everyone was shooting here for a $2 hot dog.  Too bad the hot dog wieners are slim like slim jims.  Just okay, but great if you are short on time and funds!"}
{"text":"I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! We paid $26 for a 14 inch pizza with three toppings and 2 drinks. I understand vegas and I don't mind paying for reallly good food but this was horrible. The bread was not freshly made and was frozen! Don't do it! Go to the subway next door if anything"}
{"text":"Ate a normal pepperoni pizza here on 2/5/12 at about 1:30pm and 5 hours later had horrible food poisoning, threw up all night long and violent stomach issues.  Horrible price to pay for just a so-so pizza in the first place.  Give this place a skip if you don't want to get violently ill."}
