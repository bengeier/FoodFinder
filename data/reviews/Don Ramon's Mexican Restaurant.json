{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for lunch occasionally and have had a great experience every time. The service has always been very quick and the food is excellent. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is well decorated. This has become one of our favorite places to eat. There is even a good selection for the kids menu which is nice because our kids prefer more American style food and allows the whole family to get something they like."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. New location so the decor is nice and everything is clean. Service was good.  Food was basic Mexican fare,  and I don't mean \"basic\" in a bad way. I mean the ingredients were fresh and it was straightforward Mexican food.  Good quality.  It didn't knock my socks off but I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, willing to talk to you even tho language barrier, my bf and I had a date night here recently and will return! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good - I got a bean enchilada and it was pretty soggy and bland. The waitress seemed like she didn't really care and didn't want to be there. They give you chips and salsa beforehand, though."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy coming here. The manager really gets to know frequent customers and makes sure everyone feels welcome. The food is always out very quickly. All of the staff are so sweet. Definitely kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Good food. Huge portions. Unbeatable prices. Friendly service. Easily the cleanest restaurant I've been to. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free lunch.  Truly great food at a great price.  Awesome friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this place on a whim on my way home from Cleveland. I wasn't really sure what to expect from the outside and parking lot, it seemed like a mixed bag of places. But I was hungry so I went in and I'm glad I did. It is very clean, very pretty inside. My server was very polite and helped me decide what to order. I ordered the California burrito and an iced tea. The steak had a ton of flavor, I really enjoyed it. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars...once I was finished and ready to go, it seemed as if everyone disappeared. I had to wait longer than I would've liked for bill so I could get going."}
{"text":"Definitely a very good, authentic, Mexican food restaurant. Highly recommended, so good I couldn't stop myself from eating and took a picture after haha."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is beautiful. I loved the decor inside.   We came on a Friday night, the restaurant was busy. We ordered waters and a pitcher of margaritas. The water tastes really weird, I don't know if it always tastes like that or what. I'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them. They were delicious, but who really wants to just drink fruity slush without the tequila? ;)   Our service was just okay. But, maybe that was just because they were really busy?   The food itself was really good! I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. Big portions! I also enjoyed their salsa that came with the chips!   I'm definitely willing to give this place another try. Maybe it was just an off night for service and margaritas!"}
{"text":"After going to this place several time I have given up. The food is average at best.  Service is usually somewhat slow.  The reason I won't be back is b/c the only way you are given complimentary chips and salsa is if you sit at a table.  The only reason I found out was when two women sat near me at the bar they asked for and were denied chips and salsa.  I was never told even though I ordered a drink and meal.  I can see if you are at the bar just drinking.  Maybe they have had moochers at the bar drinking and eating c&s without a meal order.  Anyway I'll be looking for another Mexican joint to go to."}
{"text":"Ugh! After being back a few more times I have to amend me review. The last two times we've been here my fiance has ordered tacos and they've come out in some what incorrect. So this makes three times we've been here and three times his order has been wrong. Also, the last two times the wait staff has been super overwhelmed and we had to wait and wait and wait for someone to pay attention to our table. The first time we waited with boxes at least 15 min for the check and this past time we waited about the same amount of time between getting our drinks and having someone take our order. It seemed like the staff had way too many tables to take care of. So, I think we may have to wait a while before coming back- this place needs some work."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland for 3 weeks and came here everywhere. Excellent service. Great environment and amazing top notch authentic Mexican food. 5 star highly recommend."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food and the customer service was excellent. We'll be back! Try the Taco Loco, we're getting that next time, this time it was all about the Fajitas Nachos!  Also there decor was very nice!"}
{"text":"Every Tuesday my coworkers and I come to Don Ramon' s for lunch, and we all get the chicken soup. It comes with a bunch of veggies, a ton of chicken and rice. I get it without rice to cut the carbs but the trick is adding salsa. Ask for tomatillo  (Green salsa) and hot salsa (Smokey red), add 2 scoops of the green, and one of the hot red, mix until it is a brown-ish color and enjoy the flavor, especially the last bite.  Other than soup, the queso is delicious, the tacos are better than most $1 tacos, and the lunch combos are reasonably priced. If ibdont get soup, I usually go with the speedy Gonzalez.  They even have this giant meat stew called a mocahete that is huge, and worth the price.  The soup is my regular here, and u should try it too, but don't forget the salsa! Tell Julio Joe sent you."}
{"text":"My family and I just finished eating at this establishment and I'm stunned by all the positive reviews. Let me be the first one to write an honest review:  THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I've had better service at a Taco Bell Drive thru. They have random rules about how many baskets of chips you get and how much salsa, wtf? You're a Mexican restaurant, that's what you're know for idiots. Then follow it with irrational unwritten rules that claim you cannot use a gift certificate and a coupon even though nothing on the gift certificate stated these stipulations. Don't go making up random rules. And lastly, the waiters have a difficult time understanding your orders/requests. I realize we live in a melting pot, hell I'm also an immigrant, but require your wait staff to know and understand English or ask for help from someone who does, don't just pretend.   Ultimately the sub par tasting food is not worth the hassle. Avoid this location of Don Ramon at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in to grab a bite on Sunday night. It's a nice little spot and the food is pretty decent. I had the Burrito Norteno and it was probably one of the best burrito I have had in Cleveland but my wife was not impressed with the Tamales the meat was good but the cornmeal was cold and a little too thick. All in all we will probably be back to try again since it near by and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hallelujah!  Finally, a good Mex place on the East side!  I was a bit taken aback when I walked in the door...in a good way.  The decor of this place is awesome...really  nice!  Great bar.  Whenever I go to a new Mex place I order a bean burrito, cheese enchilada, beans and rice.  This has become my, \"barometer\" meal after the chips and salsa.  Chips were pretty good.  Salsa was very good...love the fresh cilantro.  Food was every bit 4.5 stars.  Beans were really good and not the usual slop out of a can.  Why not a 5-star rating then?  No mole on the menu.  I was sad.  Service seemed a bit confused....I was given a menu and table service by the hostess, then the bartender took my drink order, and then someone else came over to ask if the bartender had taken my food order.  This might be a case of the waitstaff pooling tips but I think it was because they are newly opened and still working out a few kinks, all of which are easily overlooked because of the atmosphere and food quality!  Bravo to Don Ramon.  Oh wait I forgot the $6.99 weekday margarita special.  Of course I dipped into one of those.  There are few rules in life and one of them is never pass up a weekday margarita special.  Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"My last ditch effort at the last legal drug.  That's about all I can say for this place - they have alcohol."}
{"text":"First time there last night.  Super nice server and good margarita.  However, while chewing my first bite, I thought \"odd\" and had to spit something out that was unchewable.  Know what it was?  I SPIT OUT A CLIPPED FINGERNAIL. I've never sent food back in my life but called the server over and pointed to it on the table.  He was also shocked.  Got someone else to come to the table.  He swiftly picked it up and said \"no, it is a piece of the rice.\"  I disagreed (it was so obvious what it was) and he continued to argue and I just said \"I can't possibly eat this.\"  He took my dinner away and left.  I was unsure what to do and asked the server \"can I leave?\"  He said we was freaked out as well \"but I just work here\" and asked me to wait for the other guy to return.  I asked if I was free to go (and had drunk half a margarita) and he just nodded.  No apology, nothing.  I got the heck out of there.  I UNDERSTAND YOU CANNOT CONTROL EVERYTHING IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS BUT THE DENIAL, RUDENESS, AND LACK OF CARE ONE BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION IS INEXCUSABLE!"}
{"text":"The service was superb. The manager Julio stopped by twice to make sure everything was good. The food was superb. The fajitas were incredible. The hot salsa was really hot, the chips were warm and low in salt.  The frozen one margarita was perfect.  This place has the best ambience of any Mexican restaurant in Cleveland.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So I live in lyndhurst and usually travel to Lakewood to get my Mexican food but not anymore... Wow. I ordered the burrito ranchero and it was beyond my wildest dreams of deliciousness. Not to Mention the staff was as accommodating as possible for me and I was with a group of 20 somethings. I will be going back to don Ramon every time I'm feeling Mexican from now on and you should as well."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Decor is very cool and detailed. Love going there and getting a few different platters. Food is great and portions are amazing. Can't beat the Margaritas too! Been several times. Always courtesy staff."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Just wanted a light meal and a drink before going to a movie. I ordered a Margarita.  She asked if I wanted salt. I said no. It came with salt. They corrected it and I could forgive this. We all make mistakes. Then they serve a bowl of chili without a spoon. Our food comes on a scalding hot plate and the food runner says nothing about the temperature of the plate. I order another drink and am asked if I want my food boxed. I say no I'm going to eat it. I am talking and I'll admit not paying attention to my plate but suddenly it's gone a few minutes later. They left the chips and salsa and chili, but took my enchilada and rice. Get it together. I've been in hospitality for 25 years and willing to forgive a lot, but for a new restaurant you guys are really lacking."}
{"text":"I have visited the Warrensville Heights location on several occasions and never been disappointed.  This visit to the new location was even better.  The Lyndhurst location is closer to where I live and I found out, upon checking out, that they have only been open for 1 week.  I visited on a Friday night, which was fairly busy, so there was a wait of maybe 10-15 minutes.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff is super friendly.  Upon being seated, I ordered the 120z Margarita ($4.99), on the rocks and the mixed sizzling fajita platter ($15.99)(shrimp, chicken, beef, veggies).  My margarita arrived a short time later, along with a huge basket of warm tortilla chips and a side of nicely flavored salsa.  The entree arrived, and it was delicious.  Sizzling, as promised, huge portion, nice flavor and adequate # of warm tortillas, along with a plate of rice, guacamole salad, lettuce, sour cream, pico de gallo and refried beans.  Service was just a tiny bit slow, but not bad for having only been open for 1 week.   I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good atmosphere, great tasting food. A little higher scale than your standard Mexican restaurant.  Order the chicken chorizo and pineapple it's to die for.  All I can say to that is you're welcome and have a nice day"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious and the waiters were very tentative. The waiter stopped by every few  minutes and asked we're we okay. The food came out steaming hot and very fresh. Some people give this place a bad review but I think this place is very good and is the best Mexican food I have tasted in Cleveland. They also have specials on Margaritas on certain days so look out for the specials. I got one of the fan favorites which is the Taco Loco dish which is it must try. I am impressed with Don Ramon and I will return."}
{"text":"Got the worst food poisoning of my life from a grilled chicken burrito here. I used to eat hete regularly, but never again."}
{"text":"Really  slow  service.  Was sitting at the bar with one other customer there and it still took 5 minutes to order a drink.  It was like they didn't want my money..."}
{"text":"Better than last time but still not hitting on all cylinders. Service was better this time with Tina. Marguerite better this time. Chicken stew was good. Better than food off the hot table.   Salsa is unusual and does not appeal to me. Some side sauces would be welcome. If you are looking for American take on Mexican food this might be welcome.   We prefer another but they are not open on Sunday so we came here. Will come again."}
{"text":"Been there many many many times food is always good but service sometimes a little goofy......not sure why the bartender works there..he seems to pay more to the young makes than anyone else at the bar and is very slow it looks like one bartender does all the work and the guy actually need some help making drinks for the bar and the restaurant"}
{"text":"UPDATE JUNE 2016:  We continue to get mediocre food and even worse service each and every time we come.  Literally had the worst server I've had in any restaurant in my life tonight.  Place continues to appear less busy every time we drive by and it's no wonder to me why.  Go anywhere else for your Mexican cuisine.  Chipotle is better than this.  Down to 1 star from 3."}
{"text":"Rancid Tortillas!      Me and my family came here for lunch to celebrate my brothers birthday, We had come here twice before in the past and had good experiences so we thought it'd be a good choice.     My how have things changed. My brother and his wife showed up about 15 min. earlier than the rest of us and got a table and were hungry so they went through 2 baskets of chips and 2 salsas prior to us showing up. When we arrived we asked for chips and salsa for the rest of the table.     The waitress brought out another 2 baskets and when we requested more she said that's all we could get and would charge for more. (This has never been the case in any other Mexican sit down restaurant \"We'd been in\" and the last time we came here to this location they had no problem bringing them upon request) The waitress also had to be asked twice to bring straws and an extra set of  silverware (since we had dropped one on the floor) to the table. All of this is bad and can be blamed on a bad waitress but the worst part was when the food came.    After eating through half of the fajita I noticed a kinda rancid taste. I then smelled just the tortillas which come in foil and man were they Rancid! Nasty!  I informed the waitress and asked her to smell the tortillas for herself and just so happens she was sick with a stuffed nose so she couldn't smell anything and said she would take it back to the kitchen to have them smell. Serving food to people when you are sick should NEVER be done. One of us was immune compromised and nearly fell out of his chair hearing that she was sick (only AFTER we had eaten all her germy food). She never brought out new tortillas or mentioned anything about them again. I had eaten the food without the tortillas and let it go since we were trying to enjoy my brothers day. Upon checking out the manager did not look at us or ask how the meal was (probably because he knows they are serving rotten tortillas) and had the waitress ring us up. Needless to say we will not be returning and judging from how many people were in the restaurant others have made the same choice."}
{"text":"We had frequented the Don Ramon's in Bedford/N. Randal many times and have always been pleased, so I had a very positive expectation for this new location especially so close to home. Nope couldn't have been more wrong: Poor service, bad presentation, blah food, unresponsive server and manager. First it was not busy, so the service should have been great, took entirely too long to get beverages and then get our order placed. Then a very long wait before the food actually started coming out of the kitchen. Two of the 4 entrees we ordered were average at best. The kids grilled cheese was sad, it was the last item we received, the cheese wasn't melted and one of the two pieces of bread was the end of the loaf. FYI, there is an Entenmanns Bakery Outlet 2 doors down. The presentation on the plates was pathetic, hey at least try and make it look good, by then I was too annoyed to try and enjoy my meal. When I complained to the server, she got the manager, when I complained to the manager I honestly don't think he cared to either try and make it right. Won't be going back there. Too many places to spend my money that actually care and do a nice job."}
{"text":"Overall a very pleasurable dining experience. All five members of our party liked our meals. We sampled the margarita lime chicken, camarone mojo del ajo, burritos rancheros, carne asada, chicken chimichanga, flan and churros. The service was timely and the food was good. The portions were ample, so we came home with leftovers. Prices were reasonable. We will go back. I would give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. This restaurant is new to this location, and we hope they stay. We went for my Mother's Day dinner, and it was a good choice."}
{"text":"Bland fajitas. Draft beers are big and cold. Chips are cold but not bad. Service wasn't bad but wasn't good either. I'd come back for the beer."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and really enjoyed everything we order. Sometimes the staff can be a little slow with the check but otherwise great service."}
{"text":"Went on the premise of a new restaurant in a familiar location. Beautiful inside. Was able to really take in the atmosphere waiting over an hour for our meal. We were told there were many parties that night so apparently the staff cannot keep up on a busy night. I was two thirds of the way done with my meal when the server asked if we wanted hot sauce or anything.  A bit late but no thank you. Had a nice time people watching while I waited and Waited for our check. Was very disappointed for a higher end restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in lyndhurst. See my boy Jamie the waiter for great service. The chicken is my go -to. Good drinks and good service. Chips and salsa with your meal come out quick and warm."}
{"text":"This was my first time and it was the best all around. The decor is beautiful. New and classy. Loved the bathroom sinks. Our server was funny and awesome! Jaime. Margaritas were delicious, cheap, and strong. Burrito was cheap, flavorful, and filling. I am in love with this place! I will be here many times over."}
{"text":"Newly opened here. The menu is chock full of items to choose. Large portions..we are stuffed!! The wait staff (Adrian) was very attentive, friendly and oh, yeah and  attentive.  When considering that they have not been open very long, we are quite impressed. Good luck and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is kind of a strange place.  We walked and for several minutes there was not a soul to greet us. We just stood there awkwardly eating. This is very easily the best decorated  Mexican restaurant I have ever stepped foot into.  Next I ordered the chili Verde with pork. What I received was beef in a tomatilla salsa.  The beef did not work at all. A few minutes later I got carnitas in a tomatilla sauce. This was better the pork was fork tender. The side of cilantro and corn tortillas never arrived until I flagged the  server down.  The chilli verde was a bit sour and was borderline too salty. My guess is that the carnitas are properly salted and so is the tomatilla salsa,  but both a bit too much.  The GF ordered a side of enchilada, they we're decent. Nothing special.  The menu is huge, so many thing, but many seem lime the same thing just slight renditions. The salsa was fresh but uninspired,  we added a home made hot sauce to the salsa and that helped.  They offer cheese sauce that could be substituted for red sauce for 1$ something more, and then another blub on the menu offered red sauce could be substituted for 1$ something. Quite strange. Will I return, yes it's close and most dishes are reasonably priced,yes.   Will I get c"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! From the salsa to the entrees I was very pleased with the food. However, the service was frustrating. Our waiter was new (which is understandable, this place recently opened) but he seemed very poorly trained and was unfamiliar with the menu. I still plan to return and hopefully the service will improve!"}
{"text":"To me this place was just ok. The service was really impeccable tho. The food to me  was bland and could have been better but I did like the portion size of the meal. The drinks for the happy hour were ok also. And we also came here because we had $5 dollars off because it was printed on the back of our receipt from Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the pitcher of margaritas was better than I thought it would be. The flaming fajita was just that. On fire as it came to the table. Great presentation. More food than I could finish, and that is saying something. The chips and salsa were hour and delicious also. I definitely recommend.  The service was very good, which can be a challenge for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Mediocre food, at best. The water didn't taste right. The salsa was just okay. I ordered chicken fajitas which were bland and not even worth eating. Husband ordered green sauce chicken enchiladas. He said they were alright. Nothing to write home about. Best Mexican we've had is Lopez in Cleveland Heights or Tres Potrillos. We could have gotten better food at Taco Bell..."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch. They have good chips and salsa. We love their chicken soup for lunch. It's homemade deliciousness with lots of veggies, chicken, and fresh avocado sliced on top. We also get the chorizo queso which is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Will probably try again as food wasn't bad but I am a stickler for good service and our waitress was a tortoise. I almost finished my dinner before my drink came..."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here and will never return!! I come to this restaurant all of the time. I ordered drinks and food for multiple people. I asked for more salsa and was told that that we could only get 2 salsas. I asked the manager, Ary (who another waiter told me his name was Arturo) about this and he came over very hostile and rudely told me that that policy started last week and said that if I had a problem that I shouldn't come back. His customer service and attitude was rude and hostile over a small cup of salsa. I waited for my food for over 30 minutes after (with a hungry 3 year old child) and no one came out to bring it. I asked for the manager again and he never came. When I expressed my disappointment of the customer service to the waiter and told him to just cancel the order and asked for the manager for the third time, he finally came out when I was paying for beverages.  I will NEVER go back there. Again the service tonight was horrible and the manager was extremely rude!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good. Been there 3 times now I think.  Like the guacamole . This time got the taquitos, 3 with guac., salad and rice or beans . Chicken was a little dry but beef was good. Husband loved his quesadilla . ( forget the name but not under the appetizers).  The table split Sopaipillas and Churros . Churros ok, La Fiesta's are better , sopaipillas basically fried flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar and sauces ( not like puffy donuts in other words).  Imo Don Tequila or LaFiesta are probably better but Don Ramon isn't bad if that's where you happen to be. Spent about $30 for 2 entrees and the churros, no drinks."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food and friendly staff. Little bit expensive but very tasty. Portions are big."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this location to open for awhile and the food and service were awesome.  The Margarita was tasty,  the food was bubbling hot,  and our servers were friendly.  They also have amazing Margarita deals during the week!  I'm so happy that there is a Mexican place close to us!"}
{"text":"Totally different tonight.  Sat at the bar - no one appeared for 15 minutes.  There were at least 6 servers? Just standing around doing nothing. The bartender finally showed up and instead of waiting on me he mopped the floor and then took care of someone else's tab.  Food is very average w/no Mexican flavors - BLAND!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place now 3 times and each time has been good. The food is always on point and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The Taco Loco looks amazing and Im told it taste Great. (I cant try it due to it having shrimp in it) *Shellfish Alergies Suck* The Carne Asada (Steak and Onions) is my entree of choice.....Love it!!  Drink specials are always displayed and the drinks are decent, but great for the price!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Decor is wonderful (the ladies room is stunning! I know..odd but the sinks are beautiful)  Fantastic frozen lime margaritas, and great fajitas (once I got the steak,once I got the combo). Both times I asked for veggies well done but it didn't happen....the serving skillets weren't sizzly either time which is part of a fajita experience. Both times I sent them back to get the veggies done more and they politely complied. My niece ordered steak tacos and got chicken but again, it was quickly corrected.   The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the service. The first time our server was pleasant enough just not very friendly. The 2nd time,our server was a very loud guy who kept wanting to bump fists like we were frat bros, but took 3 reminders for extra napkins.   Will definitely go back again as the food is delicious and that's hard to find around here!"}
{"text":"Rating this 1 star bc the food was decent but the service was absolutely horrid. My husband and I will never return to this place."}
