{"text":"Get the green tacos!  Atmosphere is great!  I don't think ill ever bowl at an amc again!  Spoiled!"}
{"text":"Hosted my birthday party there and the service was outstanding. The food was delicious and brought out hot and on time.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and made sure that whatever we needed, we got. While it may be a bit pricey----its a great place for those special celebrations that you'll remember for a long time.  The atmosphere is super fun and a great place to party with friends. I would highly recommend this place to plan that special occasion with friends."}
{"text":"I need to update my last review......Since my last entry, the staff read what I had wrote, and went thru the trouble to contact me.  They sincerely apologized for the mishap and rushed to get me a quote for my event.  I want to thank Brandon and Jackie for their efforts, and let them know I'll keep Lucky Strikes in mind for the next event."}
{"text":"WOW! We wanted a fun rehearsal dinner with class and Lucky Strike beyond delivered. The staff was amazing Nicole, Rudy,  & Dallas made us feel like VIP's even though there was a big corporate event that rented the entire other half of the building. The wait staff was amazing at bringing out the food at just the right time. The food was delicious. Mac-n-cheese bites are a must have. Flatbread pizzas were a family favorite. I only wish parking validation was longer then 2 hours. The best \"Hipster\" playground in PHX!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and a cool place, just a bit overpriced.  I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We had friends in town and needed a place to hang out, eat and drink.  This place was perfect.  You can eat there (which had ok food choices but GREAT drink choices) or hit one of the local restaurants nearby.  We went to Blue Hound then bowled.  Atmosphere was cool, hip and fun.  Large screen televisions helped entertain and large couches were relaxing after rolling a strike.  Young, old and children alike will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Im reading reviews that are not soo great but my review is just based on taking classes on trips. I would not normally pay 60 bucks a person to bowl, and would honestly rather play at the bowling alley next to a strip club not far from where I live, for 1.00 on sundays BUT for a class trip its a go to forsure. 

This is the place where we take our students who are severley disabled and they re nothing but amazing!. We have dealt with situations that might have had us kicked out in some places ( due to ones with behaviour issues) but they have been nothing but patient and understanding.....hey its just another day in our work day why not shake theirs up a bit too i guess.  The prices for classes are that you pay by the hour so approx 50 bucks, or 5.95 a student. You have to book in advanced, but thats no biggie, and bumpers are put up if needed. Its also  wheelchair accesable.  We don't order anything but they have been decent about allowing our students have their own drinks, something I doubt is normally allowed. We go around when it opens so we usally have the whole place to ourseleves which is also pretty awsome.  So if you have a class I def think you should take your students there because its nicer then any bowling alley they proably ever been to and the people are REALLY NICE!. 

Now if you do go ahead and bring your class and they do turn out to be captal you know whats, im soooo sorry!, ive been there a few times each time dealing with a different experience with my students and we have never had an issue with any of the staff.

The washrooms are small so if you have to do any sort of diaper changing, full clothing changes, etc your best bet is in the mall because they re no change tables, or family washrooms.  * sad face*"}
{"text":"UPDATE:

I'll tell you this much: Lucky Strike does listen to customers and take customer service seriously.

Shortly after this review, I got a nice note from their corporate headquarters apologizing for a not-so-good experience, and that's all I needed. I dig a company who acknowledges that there is always room to better serve their customers. I've been back to Lucky Strike many times (for lunch, for dinner, for a lazy Sunday) since then and there is definite improvement in phone manners and in handling customers' questions.

More importantly, Phoenix management went above and beyond for me on  a busy Friday night. I didn't expect an agreeable response, I simply thought there was no harm in asking, and management surprised me with an excellent solution.

And that excellent solution made a new mom/birthday girl very happy.

Fist bump to PHX management and staff.

Now if they can only do something about my game, I'd be set."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday around 430 and it wasn't too busy then (of course it got busier as time went on), but food and servers were decent. They have 3 pool tables you can rent by the hour which was nice but watch out for the pillars that are right next to those tables! They can make some shots a lot more difficult than they need to be. If you want to bowl, get started before 6. Prices go from $8 per game with shoes to $50 per lane plus $8 per game with shoes."}
{"text":"Our group rented the entire place. Staff was very attentive. Great atmosphere.  Food was not great. Overall good time for all"}
{"text":"Fun times! I went here for a friend's birthday bash. It was a Tuesday and the place was packed with hot downtown folk! Men in suits having fun and not minding us girls in jeans and baseball caps! The atmosphere was surprisingly welcomg. Not pretentious. We went during happy hour and the food was fab for the price. Pretzels and wings were yummy. The 2 buck beers kept us hydrated. Oh and the bowling was fun, too. Waiter was a great sport...we were typsy and a tad obnoxious but he never fret about it. We left before the velvet ropes came up outside. The DJ was setting up on the side and the mingling singles replaced us and the businessmen with their weekedn outfits and cologne!

The 411 on the time frame and deals we scored:
Daily Happy Hour
4-7PM
Join us for food & drink specials. Drinks incl: $2 Domestic drafts, $3 Well Drinks, $4 House Wines, and 1/2 off selected menu items.

Dress: college tee to business tie"}
{"text":"This review is only based on the bar area/happy hour. Although this review is negative, I will defiantly be returning for bowling which I know will be an awesome experience.

So my hubby and I went yesterday afternoon (A Saturday) to check out happy hour. I had read on their website that they do Happy Hour everyday of the week from 4-7 with drink specials and some 1/2 priced menu items. The decor is amazing and we love how you can watch the lanes while hanging out in the bar. We sat down and as soon as the waitress saw us, I picked up the menu and asked \"Is this the happy hour menu?\" And she said \"Yes, it is all 1/2 priced\" Perfect. My husband and I both got a well mixed drink. It was fine. However, our bartender/waitress was throwing off a weird vibe (I don't know how to explain it, but she made us feel uncomfortable and barely said a word to us) so we decided to just have the one drink and leave. We paid and after exiting, we saw the sign that had their happy hour specials listed which said $3 well drinks. We both got well drinks but were charged $5 for each drink. I understand that we sat down about 8 minutes before 4pm that day but after remembering that the first thing I asked the bartender was about their happy hour specials, you would assume you would get happy hour prices or she would tell you that she would have to wait until after 4pm to honor the prices if their pos system worked that way. I know it is only $4 but I think it is just common courtesy to say something."}
{"text":"I live downtown so any bowling I can walk to and stumble home from is just perfect. We tend to bring out international/out of town visitors there for a fun night out on weekdays. All in all bowling there is fun, but expensive. I've not been on a weekend yet, I wonder if they really uphold those crazy dress codes. (check their site)

The pros:
- It makes downtown Phoenix more awesome. 
- It's nice looking inside, clean and upscale appearance and decor
- They have fun promos with the green pin (waitress witnesses you knock it down when it's pin 1 and you get a free app, etc).
- The waitresses are usually great and friendly

The cons: 
- It is really expensive bowling.
-The shoes still smell even tho it's upscale
-The house wine wine tastes like it came straight from a box, legit. It's so so so bad and at $6/glass or $4/glass/happy hour you'd hope for it to not be truly crappy wine. I wish they would kick it up a notch and get a bubbly on that list. They clearly make enough $$ off the bowling to afford to have wine that matches their dress codes. 
- We've had a few, ahem, special waitresses who made their problems our problem or who left us thirsty for close to an hour. Thirsty bowlers are bad bowlers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that would meet the needs of different people in a large group setting, this is a great place. They provide expensive bowling with cool tv screens, a dance floor, mini arcade and pool. My first time here was a few months ago when I was invited to a birthday party in the VIP area of the bowling alley. The service we received was horrible. My friend who had spent the money for her husband's birthday was very upset and mentioned a few times that it was a complete waste of her money. In fact, we didn't receive any kind of service - while our waitress was somewhere else, the guys ended up going to the bar and getting all their drinks that way. 

I think this place has a cool concept and I wouldn't rule it out completely but I definitely think they should teach their employees the basics of customer service."}
{"text":"My family and I booked a party here for my brother's birthday.
The atmosphere, decor, and view are all great. 
It was suprisingly slow when we first arrived but got busier as our evening went on.
Staff was polite and attentive. Our waitress Christina checked in on us often and even had the music changed when we asked for something other than dance/techno.
Food was better than expected however the pizza was really greasy.
A great place to have a party with family or friends. I reccomend it!"}
{"text":"Where oh where are you Lucky Strike? This is a very difficult place to find from the get go, so if you are on your way make sure you KNOW where you are going before you get there. I am giving these guys 5 stars because I love to bowl and this place takes bowling to another level it is does not make me want to finish the phrase bowling with \"alley\"...Maybe bowling \"avenue\" :). A group of my friends went to the New Times 'Brews for Benefits\" and decided to stay for bowling. Think ultra lounge with the option to bowl. We shared some belgium fries and sliders and it definitely wasn't typical bowling alley fare. The service was great and the manager even came by and gave us all free game cards. If you are looking for a really good way to spend a Friday night these guys do a great job. 
One note on the location--It is in the Southwest corner on the second floor on the corner of Jefferson and 1st Avenue."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, but it seems with every visit it brings up major issues. I'm giving the first star for comfortable layout. Second star is for good music not being overly loud, so great place to kick it and have a conversation. 
Cons: Incredibly slow service and rude employees!"}
{"text":"First off, if you are a bowler don't come here, but you probably already knew that. The reason being the lanes are not oiled contrary to what the staff told me. So if your technique involves putting spin on the ball you will mostly end up with gutter balls. 

However, if you are looking to spend time with your friends hanging out and maybe bowl one game, this place might be the place to go. The atmosphere is more like a lounge. They have a bar area, a couple of billiards tables and a place to eat some food. 

The drinks are above average price, the cost of bowling is way above the average price as well as the shoe rentals. I can't speak about the price of the food as I didn't order any."}
{"text":"Lucky Strike is a really cool idea. Lounge, food, pool tables and bowling with a view of downtown... that is if you can find it. The first time I went we naturally followed the big neon sign. There was an entrance no where to be found. After walking around CityScape we finally found the entrance on the second level. Once we got in it was super fun! The drinks and food were good and the prices are reasonable. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the top forty music blasting. If you have to be 21 to get in you shouldn't have to listen to Justin Bieber on repeat."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this place out on a Saturday night. Hmmm, let's start at the beginning...reservations are recommended, you are assigned a concierge (unnecessary), you check in to get shoes and they imput your party's names so you don't have to fiddle around with that (nice touch. Wait did I just say fiddle, damn I'm getting old) however the check in boy seemed like he didn't enjoy his job.

A server brings you drinks...and she checks on you tons (cha-ching)!
Atmosphere is great and  there is lounge vibe all around with fun music (they have a dj). Like that they showcase art from the local scene. And a first for me to see a bowling alley with  windows. The temperature (and the shoe guy) in this place knocked my rating down to a 3 star. It was a bit warm and we asked our \"concierge\" to fix that, she said they lowered it but we couldn't tell. 

We were just there for funsies but it looked like a few celebrations were going on, so it seems like a good place for groups. The food looked good too, but we didn't partake."}
{"text":"Sat night Birthday celebration! Great lanes, very clean and service to 20 people was excellent! Highly recommend for a different bowling experience. Eric aka Superman provided great beverage & food service."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. I had to ask several times and the staff was just standing around. 
All in all fun place for the kids"}
{"text":"I had guests in town and decided to take them to Lucky Strike for something fun to do. We paid $120 ahead of time for a two hour lane reservation for 830pm. Somewhat steep, but I figured we were paying for an experience a little bit better than your average bowling night. We checked in early at 815, and were then told to wait 10 minutes before we could get our shoe rentals. Finally got our shoe rentals and were told by the guy who checked us in that our lane was ready. We sit down at our lane/table to find it completely unbussed with dirty dishes from the party before. This isn't usually a huge issue except we were never greeted by a server and I had to track down the check in guy to let him know no one had bussed the table, let alone took a drink order for the first 15 minutes of our reservation. This was the common theme of the night, CONSTANTLY getting up to track down a server to get anything done. The service overall was terrible. Finally got our food, it was okay standard bar food. Drinks were average and overpriced. The bowling was really fun but not really worth how much you pay for the overall experience."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to hold a birthday party. Great food and kid friendly. The availability for lanes can be difficult in a large group so be sure to reserve one in advance."}
{"text":"Decided to take my newest man toy to Lucky Strike Lanes last night.  I know, I know...it is WAY out of the \"orb\", but sometimes you have to branch out.  It was a cool place, lot's of huge tv's, good music, pool tables and oh yeah, a full bar (bonus!)  My date and I arrived and it was happy hour (4 - 7pm and then again from 9 - 12am) so we decided to have a few beer to loosen up and get some food.   Domestic drafts on happy hour were only $2 and certain small plates are half off.  We had the hot pretzel rods that come with cheese, spicy mustard and garlic butter - they were yumo.  We had the hot spinach dip with tri-colored tortilla chips (not on happy hour but very good!) and a couple of the sliders.  The menu reads well and they have quite a bit to offer.  You could have dinner there, or just get some nibbles.  There were lots of appetizers to choose from and next time I will definitely try the fried macaroni and cheese bites (can it get any better than that!) and they had pizzas, salads, burgers, entrees, dessert.  After a beer, we decided oh yeah, we are here to bowl.  that was kind of a down side...it was $14 a game to bowl....kind of ouch, it's bowling!  I like that you get to sit in couches instead of hard plastic chairs, and the music and lighting is good, the shoes are new.....unlike the bright light of regular bowling alleys.  But, it is kind of hard to see the lanes??  Hence why on my second bowl, I actually struck the hard plastic thing that protects the pins because it hadn't lifted yet!  It was hillarious....and in my defense, it is dark!  Oh well, something to laugh about.  DO NOT park in the underground parking lot or the lot across the street, it is $12!  This isn't downtown San Fran for sake.  If you want upscale bowling...for sure head there!"}
{"text":"Interesting venue for an unusual social event at a conference.  PROS: Excellent service. Nice atmosphere (groups of couches, not too loud, good lighting, upbeat vibe).  CONS:  Pricy for those in your group who don't bowl or drink. Food  was well prepared, but still mainly pizzas and chicken nuggets. Entrance isn't on Jefferson St (signage needed) so be sure to have get correct directions."}
{"text":"The happy hour is pretty good! Bowling while having happy hour (beer and food) bowling prices were pretty good also. We went on a Saturday before 7 pm and it wasn't as crowded and!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the management staff this evening. They decide to check ID's at the door (which they had never done before) just to tell us that \"it's always been the rule\". As the manager is telling us that \"we start checking IDs at 9PM\" a family with 2 kids come walking out. So you start checking IDs tonight, say that you check ID's at 9pm, and then a family of 4 comes walking out (mind you it's 10pm). So is there any part of the rules that you just implemented you adhere to? My favorite part of this whole thing is the manager denying us service because he contradicted everything he said and made himself look like an idiot. So we get the short end of the stick. Great. I really hope you rethink how you run your establishment because tonight was simply disappointing."}
{"text":"Made plans to head over to Lucky Strike after hearing about it (3) times in one week: my girlfriend went with her work, it was highlighted on \"Undercover Boss\" and again on E's Kendra... it was time. We went on Friday, about 8pm and it was packed... but we didn't mind. We checked in and they said it would be about 2 hours until we got a lane... no problem, we grabbed a drink (me, a Coppola cab - the fiance, a Kiltlifter). His beer was fine, but the cab was SKUNKY. I let the bartender know and he swiftly opened a new bottle sans tude... I liked that.
We were waiting for (2) friends who arrived about 15 minutes later... about 10 minutes after that our buzzer alerted us the lane was open (so the (2) hour wait was really closer to 30 minutes. Not bad!
The atmosphere is super clubby, almost in a bizarre way. They have bouncers at the door and you literally get turned away if you don't meet the dress standards (no hoodies, baggy clothes or hats). Kinda weird, but in a way I get what they are trying to do.
The alley part is dark, with lounge style seating and super loud music. Very fun for bowling, but not ideal for convos. They have a little bar area with a DJ which is a bit quieter. 
We had apps, but they have a full menu. The pretzel dippers and boneless chicken wings were very tasty. 
Everyone had a great time, we'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We went for a work party and I was expecting a mundane half hearted attempt to work up some smiles while downing a couple of beers and trying to make conversation, however it was swanky cool in this place, decent music selection, and kinda like cosmic bowling meets ultra lounge meets dave and busters (if that even makes sense). It was not easy to find and parking was a bit of a hassle as most downtown parking is, but they lost a star for location and accessibility. The staff was extremely friendly and they had a huge notch above what you would consider \"bowling alley fare\". Im currently still on my vegetarian kick so I did the green chili tacos and they were really good. I went for a work party, but I will be back on a date. Check it out for date night for sure."}
{"text":"This is solely a review just on the bar:
Paid $17.50 for a washington apple and a redbull with vodka. 2 drinks, small cups, about 12 icecubes in these cups too making it about a 10 sip drink. Definitely never going back here to drink at the bar...could have bought a whole bottle of vodka for that. No wonder we only saw 2 other couples there haha, should have guessed."}
{"text":"I am thrilled that Lucky Strike is open in CityScape.  If you need a break from an exhausting work morning, you go there and lunch and bowl.  Relieve some stress and get a great lunch.  AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Our lane couldn't count! We couldn't even finish a game of bowling without our lane missing a pin to put down, counting our throw incorrectly, and twice in the hour our lane completely blacked out and we needed desk assistance to reset. For a hour of bowling Saturday night it was $60 plus shoe rental which was outrageously expensive for such crappy service and crappy lanes. The manager explained sometimes the lanes have issues and gave us a free hour of bowling to come back and play again. It was too frustrating to go back there even if it was free. The TVs were blaring and seating was uncomfortable too. Belgian fries were tasty so I give it two stars."}
{"text":"I'd definitely go back.  It's nothing more than  swanky bowling alley.  Straight forward bowling, beer, foods and friendly staff.  Half-way through our second game, the lane wasn't working right, therefore we just talked to the manager and got our money back.  Like i said, straight-forward.  It was about 13 bucks for two games and shoes. (4  people)."}
{"text":"A lot of fun in a nice atmosphere. Bowled a few games with the family and enjoyed some beer and appetizers. The grilled buffalo wings were great! If you are looking for a place to hang out when it's raining, this is a very good option."}
{"text":"Bowling is it a bit over priced. Drinks are good. Happy hour food is great. They have a variety to choose from. Love their tacos. They have pool tables and pretty cool little arcade."}
{"text":"Lance is the best bartender I've had yet! He was totally my favorite aspect of my experience! This place is super cool, it even has an arcade with life size connect four!"}
{"text":"Lucky Strike is by far the best bowling alley I've ever been to.  The atmosphere is super cool and loungey, service is on point, really cool prints on the walls, great food (love the mini-burgers), and one of my favorite parts....giant TVs with sports on all over the place
I am the store manager of Urban Outfitters at CityScape, and we recently had our store's Holiday Party here...let me say that Lucky Strike was more than accommodating, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about Lucky Strike and finally got my chance to go this past Saturday. As soon as I got there I knew it was going to be a good time, it is really well kept, blasting AC, loud (but not too loud music), and huge T.V.s. The bowling lanes were very nice with big couches to sit on and large table areas. Our server was great and didn't make a big deal about splitting our checks. He was very knowledgable about the menu and quick. We went during happy hour so we got a bunch of appetizers to share including the mac and cheese bites (everyone's favorite), fries, and two flatbread pizzas (also very yummy). The appetizers were around $4 each, beer $3 and cocktails $4, we paid $4 for shoes and $4 per person for each game. It was pretty cheap for something to do to get out of the house for a few hours, especially in this heat. Overall I loved it and will be returning for some bowling and mac n cheese bites very soon."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my work peeps for a team event.  (We usually have poker nights on Thursdays, this week we decided to be rebels)

We booked the VIP section that was completely private & secluded (we have about 18 IT guys and 4 directors, 2 marketing, 3 HR and 2 admins). 
It's directly to the right side of the mall , if you are coming from Steele's. There is no way you could miss it. It's got the black and white pattern all on the outside. 

 This is supposed to be the \"cooler\" bowling place. I assume it's because of the size. Inside it's massive.

The bowling , drinks & food was free (company paid) so I can't tell you how expensive it was. What I DO know, is a Coors light draft here was $6.00 

There was a pesto pizza that was ATOMIC BOMB good. It's pure veg. There was chicken samosas that were baked (weird). not a fan. 
The spring rolls were delicious! - well, they weren't rolls. There was veggies stuffed in an egg shell shaped flour and then friend. It was quite delicious. I believe it had potatoes and peas. Yummy. 
The beef skewers were rather dry but then again I could have just had a bad batch. A few of the IT guys went crazy over them. 

Overall the service was okay. We reserved the VIP area from 7-9 but they let us play until 9:30pm. The bartender was a bit slow and looked like she was on drugs. Other than that, the rest of the staff were pretty friendly and accommodating to us.

I wouldn't really travel this far for a bowling experience but it's definitely a better looking bowling house if you have a large group or trying to impress.  The bathrooms are tiny so no points here. BLAah. 
The shoe return was a bit of a hassle but the minute they knew we were part of the VIP group, we had service instantaneously. Hmmm....

This wouldn't be my first choice, but if you are in the area, why not. 

xoxo
M."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a 5 star (and once a 1 star) kind of girl. Tonight at lucky strike severely disappointed me. We were there to just a have good night out with friends. My friend and I arrived late. It took 26 minutes to get any kind of service (we ended up going to the bartender -who was a doll...she gets 5 stars). Got food and beers and our hour on the lane was over so we went into the soft seating area. We were trying to cash out and still hasn't seen a server -it was an hour later. I got a manager involved and the server had left, charged the card that the tab was on, and never got someone else to cover their section. The manager bought us a round and was wonderful in trying to fix everything. We were waiting to go back on a lane, and it turns out they took us off the wait list since we had a lane earlier and they \"didn't think we wanted the later lane as well\". They try really hard, but it's like the fart that was forced. :("}
{"text":"Place is cool and they play great music ... We went here after a comedy show at stand up live because they are right next to each other. The only thing that sucks about this place is the service. The staff had no sense of urgency and are not personable... Great venue tho ... With better service this place could be a go to for a lot of events"}
{"text":"Lucky Strike! 

This place is Deliciously Classy. I took my sweety there for our first date. It was a Sunday just after the George Lopez \"Dream out Loud\" tour at the Comerica Theatre.  And as soon as we walked in we were in awe.  Its dark, sexy, and a lot going on.  There were about a dozen bowling lanes, pool tables, and a nice lounge area so you can sit watch your date bowl.  We arrived just before a company gathering had arrived and we were mistaken as being part of the group. So they were very happy to see us come in, and gave us the Royal treatment.   When they finally realized we were not part of the party, they asked politely to ask us to move because it was rented.  

Nicole was very nice to us, and didn't charge due to the fact that it was a mix up and I didn't understand that it was rented for another party.  All in all it was a great experience. We had a fun time , even though it was cut short.  And I will definitely be back to play and order and try out the food.  

Ive noticed people complain about the price of bowling, honestly it's a fair price, because it includes the ambiance as well and the music and good vibe this place gets.  The atmosphere of an environment is very classy and those are the types of places Id like to continue taking my date and or a group of people that Id like to impress. So 5 stars for great service, great time, and nice decor AND its in the downtown Phoenix scene, theres so much to do there, and now theres bowling!!!  NICE!!

Nicole provided AWESOME customer service!!  Great Job!"}
{"text":"I think the lanes must be sloped; balls kept veering away from the head pin. Just kidding. I say that because my bowling score looked like what I wished my golf score could be.  This is a fun place,  great music and not too loud.  Delicious cocktails but beware: the good stuff is not on the happy hour menu. Terrific staff,  nice munchies for 4 bucks.  As for the bowling, remember that it's better to be lucky than good."}
{"text":"I have been to Lucky Strikes a couple times, it is located on the second floor of Cityscape in downtown Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, last time I came with a serious beast-like hunger and I had every intention  of shamelessly stuffing my face with lots of delicious bar food as soon as I sat down. I  ordered the nachos and the mini bacon cheese burgers. Lets just say both dishes were mundane and anticlimactic at best. The nachos left me extremely unsatisfied and wanting to run to Filberto's on my way home! 
On a more positive note, the place looks very cool, modern trendy and pretty large.  It does seem good for parties and bigger groups. If bowling is your thing, I'd say this place is worth checking out but don't come for the food. just saying."}
{"text":"This place can't tell the difference between a reservation and a wad of cash watch out for the manager who puts words in your mouth then kicks you out. If this place wasn't in such a good location I'd say let's laugh and watch it fail. I will enjoy this place as soon as they clean house with the pompous incompetent staff."}
{"text":"I have thoroughly enjoyed every time I've been at Lucky Strike the staff is friendly the games are fun they have good food good solid service which is so important. the only drawback is the parking is not so great so you only get 4 stars."}
{"text":"I new it would be a fun night as soon as I walked into this place!  Great upscale atmosphere.  Makes bowling fun!  Huge screen TVs at the end of each lane.  The menu and food is great! Service was fantastic, never waited for anything.  We had a group of 10 and we all had a great experience!"}
{"text":"So we finally got a chance to hit up lucky strikes last night. It's super nice, and a great place to have some drinks and shoot some pool. Did you notice I missed the bowling part? well I'm sure the bowling WOULD be fun, it we were able to bowl. We got there around 800 and were told there would be about a 45 minute wait. We decided to shoot some pool and have some drinks while we waited. The service...well, our server was nowhere to be found until my buddy flagged down a manager. We finally decided to leave around 1130, never got a chance to bowl. soooo 3 and a half hours and no bowling, that sucked. tremendously. Will I go back? Sure, why not. I love the location and the lounge is a great place to have some drinks and shoot pool. Is it all that and a bag of chips? Nope no sir"}
{"text":"What else can fit inside Vaughan Mills.?.!.?

The facility incorporates few pool tables, full size bowling lounge and bar with nice seating area. I was there for a work event and we enjoyed to the fullest.

Firstly, the staff is amazing and very friendly... the bartender was nice to deal with and the serving staff was quick and friendly. They were also nice enough to bring out a birthday cake for us and pass out champagne for the work celebration. The food was decent as we had pizza and a bunch of appetizers. 

Secondly, the pool tables were in good condition and they have about 3 of them at the front.

Thirdly, the bowling area and lanes were newish and clean, with nice big screens.

The washrooms need a bit of clean but overall were in a decent condition and as its Vaughan mills there is plenty of parking..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on a date Sat night.. Went to stand up live 1st, then after to lucky strike for a drink.  My boyfriend ordered a vodka tonic... WEAK.. So he ordered a double.. willing to pay whatever.. As the girl made the drink.. I did a drink count with her.. (I have been in the service for 16 years) She just put in a larger glass, and did a 3 count.. I asked her about it and she said she did a six count.and if we wanted more she would have to charge for a double plus another drink... girl plzzzz. I watched you...learn how to count!... Rude service!! ! I'll stay at Copper Blues.Thanks"}
{"text":"Went there for a special event, which was organized very well. The host did a great job! . Lots of nice people, games and great food! 
I liked the atmosphere there, very different than  just a regular bowling place...
I would go back there for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Took the family downtown, decided to go bowling and we had a great time! Really fair prices and great atmosphere! I really liked their long island ice teas!! Awesome awesome service!! Management gave us a free bowling it was a great time! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Last weekend on February 7th 2015 my boyfriend and family celebrated my birthday at lucky strike. My boyfriend is from NYC and I use to live there too, I'am always looking for the hottest places in the valley and this is 1 great spot. I like this place because it reminded me of the bowling alley on times square. We all had a great time thanks to our hostess/server named Lauren she was always there to serve us. I believe the server can give you a great or shitty experience. But Lauren she gave us a awesome experience! She served our meals and drinks quickly through out the whole night, she kept our table clean and clear always brought new dishware. We had a group of 10 people so we had a overload of food all of us was pleased with her professionalism and quickness. We must have asked her to serve us at least 10 times she worked quickly stayed kind, cheerful and funny, brought laughs to all of us. I've had rude servers in the past but Lauren treated us great I'am glad she didn't get annoyed. She always stopped by to see if we needed anything she arranged for my cake to be stored in the fridge I was a bit worried because my boyfriend spent $350.00 on the cake she reassured us everything will be fine and so on. I'd have to say lucky strike has a great worker  I think she should be recognized as employee of the month and for being such a hard worker possibly give her a pay increase for such outstanding work ethics. Thank you Lauren for making my birthday a great night! Next time you go to Luck Strike ask for Lauren she's a great server and don't forget to give her a BIG TIP!"}
{"text":"We had a blast here! The server we had was great and came back to check on us often! Would definitely recommend! Next time we're in downtown Phoenix, looking for something fun to do we will come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a Bday party. First time. Great setup and decent food. Although traffic flow at the pool tables needs work. DJ is a nice touch. Grace was our lane server and was very attentive to our group of about 20. She provided excellent service with smile!"}
{"text":"*****Location=EXCELLENT!

****The fact that it is downtown and not in Scottsdale or a Suburb= GREAT!

***Bowling= Standard.

***Drinks= Standard.

***Food= Above average for a bowling alley. Not bad at all.

****Wait-staff= Nice and full of energy. This was a highlight.

***Decor= Upscale and nice. Slightly ironic with all the \"Obey\" posters in the middle of highly corporate establishment.

*Music= I like loud music, but this was deafening! I had to yell into my friend's ears so they could hear me. This caused more ear drum damage.

***DJ=  It was digital-style DJing. Mostly pop-rap and some house classics synced to the videos w/ some live scratching.  I think they should call him a Music Video Projection Artist in addition to DJ. This is for the new school crowd and for me, not an every weekend mix-but it was highly entertaining. I enjoyed throwing my 15 Lbs bowling ball toward the high priced cars, gold plated teeth, and champagne bottles, in the rap videos at the end of the lanes--like a G6. 

*Attitude of managers, host people, and most bowling staff= TERRIBLE! Please leave your ego in your domicle. There is no reason that you have to let me know how cool and important you are. I just want to bowl and have a drink.  Prententious and unhelpful! (not all of them, just 90% of them). If you desire return customers please act like you are happy that people are spending money at your business--not that we are a burden...\"No problem\" they say, after giving us the run-around, and about five different answers to the same question.
(Note, my party was a party of professionals that were dressed up and we were NOT being 'cheap').

Conclusion, this place has great potential. It has a fantastic location and great wait-staff. Bowling is great fun anywhere, especially downtown, and in a building that does not smell like 20 years of cigarette smoke. The food and drinks are good and decently priced for downtown. The problems are easily identifiable in this review. The music could use some fine tuning and as they say \"attitude is everything.\" 

Until the management, bowling, and host staff learn this, this dude will not abide..."}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate a birthday .  It's a great place to have group fun or a special occassion.  The staff was friendly, the place was clean.  My disappointment was with the jerk chicken I ate and the bowling lane that was not working well.  Do not call  a dish jerk chicken when it seems like you have no idea what jerk chicken is.  The meat was not marinated in jerk as it is suppose to be.  I got  plain white meat on  skewers and a sweet red sauce to dip the chicken... had no taste.  Also the fries were not that great either.  The meat in the short ribs was tasty.  My family seems to have enjoyed the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"This is such an awesome concept with so much potential! I like the idea of a trendy, downtown bowling alley with a hip bar and snazzy feel. (I also love old school bowling alleys as well- especially the bars...top notch!) 

Anyhow, Lucky Strike looks really cool. The main point being \"LOOKS\". When you actually touch something and focus, this place is made of complete crap. It just looks nice because it is new. The balls are cheap and generic. The floor, lanes and light fixtures are worse than Ikea. They have little plastic stools that probably cost a buck. Give this place a little wear and the poor quality will start to show. There also aren't a lot of lanes? The bar/restaurant area is bigger than the actual bowling alley portion. Hopefully the entrance is finally completed because we had to walk up some creepy closed in stairwell strewn with old food. 

If you are going to charge over 20 bucks for two hours of bowling and attempt to be snazzy and upscale, then commit to that. 

We went around happy hour time and they had some \"deals\" if you want to call them that. The glasses of wine were so very tiny. About a half a glass each. Our server was nice, but really slow. So we would order another drink as soon as she brought one so it would time out (about 15 min between). I don't really get it either since we were the only people bowling. Better hope you aren't a Vegetarian because your only option on the menu we had was soft pretzel sticks. At least they were really tasty and had nice presentation. 

This place has good potential for sure. Come and enjoy. I just don't think the quality is worth the cost. ."}
{"text":"I went bowling at Lucky Strike in Downtown Phoenix's new CityScape development last night (a Friday night) with my wife and family.  We made reservations for 7pm, arrived on time, and then waited about 20 minutes for our lanes to be available.  It was okay, because there was music playing, good drinks served at the bar, and pool tables open, but still...

We had an overall nice time, but I expected more out of a Lucky Strike, especially this early on in its presence downtown.  The music was run-of the-mill pop music and the service was average.  Most people are fine with just going to get their own food from the bar at a bowling alley, so if you're going to assign a server/waiter to each lane, then I'd think the service better be above-average.  One thing that was not average...the mini-burgers!  Mmm, they might've been my favorite part of the night.

Considering the fact that I live in Old Town Scottsdale and probably pass five bowling alleys along the way, and the fact that I had pay for parking (since Lucky Strike doesn't validate - crazy!!), I won't be rushing to go again soon, but I'll consider going again if enough of my friends are going too."}
{"text":"I love this place. They were so great each time I've been there. We took a group of 20 one time and a group of 50 another time and they handled the group with so much professionalism from offering quick service to making suggestions for an enhanced experience. These folks know how to help entertain a group."}
{"text":"SOOO glad to have this in downtown PHX. Great vibe and decor complements a needed addition to PHX- an upscale bowling alley where I can do other stuff beyond bowling. 

Lanes are beautiful here and the televisions throughout the place makes it impossible to miss a play in a game."}
{"text":"Had a great time very nice place. Aside from our server not letting us know they had food and drink specials for happy hour so we would have been paying more if I hadn't over heard here tell the ppl that came after us in the next lane. Other than that it was a pretty great experience I would go back!!"}
{"text":"I've always had a great time at Lucky Strike - the food is good, the service is fantastic and the place is really cool and different.  It's nice to have an unscheduled, unticketed event/thing to do for the first time in downtown's history.  

Crazy, funny, hilarious Nicole and Daveon are always helpful and on top of it - there's another server, with short curly hair and a cute pierced lip that's amazing too.

My only gripe is seeing a dress code - this is kind of weird to see in Phoenix, especially downtown, where people are hipsters and scenesters and just urban folks.  If people aren't dressed appropriately, they're going to feel uncomfortable, and I don't know about you, but I *want* to know who the problematic people are by how they look when they walk in.  Heck, even when I've been to the opera, symphony, theater, etc people are dressed in shorts and t-shirts sometimes.

What would make it better?  More things to do - I'd love to see a wall of pinball machines - pinball rocks.

Also, making Cityscape more interesting would help too - there needs to be more to do at Cityscape.... put in a Sega GameWorks.... get things to do that are unique and don't require special advance planning.  Be more urban, this isn't Kierland Commons.  Put in a giant building filled with apartments, downtown needs more residents or these businesses aren't going to last through summer of 2012, guaranteed.

Still, a 5 star experience..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.. Every time with high hopes. While it's a cool set up, I'm always disappointed by the prices. Way too expensive for bowling, drinks, pool, EVERYTHING. The service is hit or miss. I feel like all their business comes from people that are unknown to the many places to go in the area. 

Cool vibe if you're with a bunch of people and just want to dance at the next door Gypsy Bar. No cover and sometimes they have artists over there painting or awesome gogo dancers. Gypsy and lucky strike are pretty much the same place. 

ANYWAY, if the prices were decent I'd probably feel better about coming here. Not my favorite place to hang out in downtown Phoenix though. You can do better you guys!"}
{"text":"I'm not complaning,  we just found the food and bowling to be over priced.   So for those that can afford it go ahead and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I'm totally digging Lucky Strike.  It is sleek, urban, and sexy  - strange for a bowling alley, but I can't think of a better way to describe the vibe there.  I almost felt weird bringing my kid with me to bowl, since the place felt so grown-up.  Luckily, we picked a kid-friendly time (Sunday morning), and the place was nearly empty.

We had fantastic service from everyone - the hostess, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress.  Our waitress was particularly awesome.  She didn't even bat an eye when our 4-year-old knocked over a glass of water.  I was happily surprised at how welcome they made us feel.  We sampled the Parmesan and Herb Fries, which were tasty, but I was wishing for more herbs and less cheese.  Maybe an interesting dipping sauce?  The menu looked interesting, especially compared to typical bowling alley food.  Looking forward to a return visit that includes a full meal!

The only downside is the price - $28 (not including food) for 3 of us to bowl one game, with shoe rental.  Maybe it is just my lack of recent bowling experience, but that seemed pretty high to me.  Luckily, the service and atmosphere made up the difference, and we won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Great place to bowl and have fun with friends.  I love the jukebox on your phone idea, just wish there were more songs available to play.  Though that's not Lucky Strikes fault.  

Anyway, we went there for the first time and there was an unmanned counter where you rent your shoes.  The manager hurried over and apologized for our 30 second wait and comped our shoes.  I didn't been notice we had to wait, but I felt like that's awesome customer service. 

Overall, great place and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Lucky me!!  I see a lot of trips to Lucky Strike in my future!  I have been a few times now and have decided I really like the place, but not just for the bowling.  I like Lucky Strike for the good food, the cool vibe, and the specials.  The bowling is just an added bonus; a little something to get you moving so you're not just sitting in the same spot drinking and eating.

The lunch specials are great and so are the happy hour deals.  Where else can you get a (really good) lunch for just over $5?  Not many places that I know of, especially in the downtown area.  And for those hard days at work when I just want to vent over a beer with coworkers, Lucky Strike is perfect!

As far as the food goes, the mini burgers are fabulous; we had the blue cheese burger (with arugula) and the buffalo chicken (grilled chicken, not \"crispy\" aka breaded and fried.)  The pretzel sticks are yummy as are the beef skewers even if they are little on the sweet side.

In addition to lunch and happy hour, I have also been on a Saturday night and had a great time.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND making reservations ahead of time.  It worked out perfectly and there was quite a wait (2 hours) when we were done.  Just make sure to round up all your friends as we needed more than 10 people to keep our reservation for two lanes. We bowled for two hours and hit the bar after that. Staff was very friendly and accommodating; mostly good looking girls in tank tops and short skirts.

Overall, Lucky Strike is a great addition to downtown.  A cool bar that has bowling, not a dirty, smoky, bowling alley.  Go for lunch, go for happy hour, or go for nighttime fun on the weekend.  Either way, I think you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"This place was exactly as expected! Decent food, great happy hour in an upscaleish bowling alley. It's a great addition to a downtown scene saturated in bars and restaurants. I love that it brings something a little different to downtown. I definitely can see myself meeting up here with friends in the future."}
{"text":"I had so much fun!! I love this place! I went for lunch bowl and spent $10.00 I bought chicken wings they were so yummy and got a free game of bowling and shoes. It was a steal!! dining and playing :) The atmosphere was great and I would definitely come back at night drink, eat, bowl and play in the arcade. They also validate parking for two hours! A nice little gem in downtown phx, somewhere I would hang out at before I had to get on a flight since its near the airport."}
{"text":"I came to lucky strike's with a couple of friends on a weekday, after we shopped a bit at Vaughan Mills. When we came to the front to pay, the younger employees seemed very unprofessional and they seemed like they didn't want to be there. When we started to bowl, our area was clean and there were big screens with different sports on each screen, which was pretty cool. It seemed quiet until it started to fill up in the evening and there were lineups to use the pool tables. During this time, I got hungry and grabbed their nachos and baked mac n cheese bites which were really good. I grabbed a pitcher of coke and spiked it with my bottle of rum...which made my bowling experience better. This place is just like any other bowling alley but gets crowded later in the evening so go early to avoid lineups."}
{"text":"Took my teen here - I'm usually really patient with servers. I know it's a tough job. But there was hardly anyone in the place other than us, and our service was terrible. I had to go find the server after 20 min to place an order. Had to find her for refills of soda. Food was meh. Went to the restroom and came back and our food and full drinks were cleared. Food was done but drinks were not - we still had plenty of time on our bowling hour. Headed to the arcade section after bowling. Paid for their card to play games, and many of the games were broken. For example - swiped the card to play air hockey to find there was no puck. Played the basketball games and one ball would release. Played skee ball and no balls would come out when you pressed start. We alerted someone in the bar area of our issues and he just said - I don't know. It's too bad - I went here once before and had a fun experience with friends. This time was not great. Or even good. Just okay."}
{"text":"Came here with group of 20 and we were taken care pretty fast. All shoes sizes were taken and shoes were selected. Pretty waitresses were offering  beer and wine. A very sweet girl after I refused from alcohol still brought  me Pepsi ( something i would never drink!) and that's was very sweet of her. 
Food was pretty good. Apparently they have their own kitchen which is unusual for Entertaintment centers like that. Just found out that they also have a night club beside arcade so deff coming back!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great, but the music was so loud you couldn't talk without yelling, but it was a Saturday night, I can understand that. What really got to me though was the lanes were not properly waxed so you couldn't slide and it would seem the AC was broken. My friends and I kept going outside to cool down. Several of us asked for the AC to be turned down and we were told the AC was broken, which is horrible is Phoenix. Overall I'd go to party there, but as a bowling alley, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had girls night out last Saturday and were so impressed by Lucky Strike.  The vibe was good, the service was good, and the staff was friendly.  We had a reservation for 7 to bowl and checked in and got our clean bowling shoes without a hitch.

Awesome drink specials from 9-close - $2 domestic drafts, $3 well drinks, and $4 house wine.  I was a little put off by the sign out front about the dress code - no \"colors\", motorcycle wear, construction boots, or cut-offs.  This place was pretty classes and I just hope it stays that way.  

Great place to celebrate a birthday or take a group.  Awesome DJ with VIDEOS (I love that) and pool tables.

:)"}
{"text":"My biggest complaint is that the service was sub-par at best. I could never find our waitress when we needed a drink and our tables got really messy really fast and I had to clean it up myself. Drink orders seems to take forever, especially towards the end of our time there. One of us ordered dessert that never came.
Food was decent....we had a party package so we had wings, pretzels sticks and sliders. Wings were   good but I wasn't a fan of the sauces for any of the dishes. Burgers were over cooked and the cheese was cold and congealed. 
Lastly, one of our parties lanes kept breaking and freezing. And then we ran out of time and couldn't finish our last game. I don't think that was necessarily fair, as much of the delay was their fault.
Atmosphere is fun though, I'll give them that. I had a good time and I would go again and give it another chance."}
{"text":"last night 5/20 i went to my friend's birthday bash held at Lucky Strikes. Upon walking into Lucky Strikes it struck me that it didn't feel like a bowling alley but rather a huge roomy club. The music was happening, there was a dj by the side bar/lounge and as you walked up the stairs/ramp it led you to a cavernous room where the bowling lanes were situated as well another bar/lounge area and two billiard tables. The overall atmosphere and decor of this place makes it a go-to destination and something central Phoenix really needed. Anywho, my friend reserved two lanes for 120 minutes, each lane was $49.99/hr and she included us in a drink package of unlimited beer and wine for $22 excl tax. let's say the unlimited drinkage helped my bowling game or lack thereof. I've never felt that pro-ish, the tipsiness really gave me courage to give it my all! liked the dj, it was a healthy mix of dance ripped top 40 with old school hip hop... it really lent a true party experience to my friend's birthday bash as well as the overall vibe of the place. BUT one thing that annoyed me with lucky strikes was the music volume, it was LOUD! now, don't get me wrong I go out to the clubs in old town and I'm used to LOUD but a club with friends is not a conversation/social experience, albeit social but i go out to the clubs to drink and get my dance on. But at a bowling alley during down times like waiting for your turn, drinking your beer, there are times you might like to chat with your friends but with the music volume, it's too loud that you spend the time nodding your head and agreeing to something you did not hear =( and it ends up being a shouting fest like, \"What?!? you said what?!? huh? No... i did not buy this shirt from..., OH you said you like my shirt?! ok!! thank you! (other person - what?!?) give up, thumbs up!\" 

Oh, food wise well it's upgraded bowling alley food with presentation if there's such a thing. lol. we ordered a basket of Parmesan herb fries $7.5 which was a large basket and the mac & cheese bites $6 which were quite bland but cheesy and was a good serving size. Overall, I liked the place, it's a great place for a birthday and everything is professional and appealing. Oh and don't forget to get your parking validated before you leave, it HELPS!"}
{"text":"First time at Lucky Strike. First, the ambience is super and it's very clean.  We were there for happy hour, great food and not very expensive at all.  Free refills on soft drinks which was a huge bonus.  Now for the downside of our visit.  We waited, and waited for a waitress to take our orders, she kept coming around the telling us she'd be right back.  This happened several times.   It wasn't busy at all, so not sure why the inadequate service.  When we did get to order, the food took forever!  For appetizers it sure took a long time, it was incredibly slow.  Refills on drinks took just as long, not sure I understand that part.  One of my friends had a common drink from the bar and it was so watered down and horrible, she should have returned it but didn't.    So  it's time to leave, the waitress brings our bills... finally.  Then we had to wait for her to come pick them up, and then bring the change back.  Three of us went to the restroom before she even brought our change and keep in mind two of us are women and take forever in the restroom.    Very slow service, not sure if she was having a bad night or maybe the kitchen and bar were holding her back.  At any rate the service wasn't great.  However, it is a neat little place and I say little because it's not huge, but I prefer that.  The music is a tad loud at times but it added to the atmosphere.   Definitely will go back again, just hoping for better service. The staff was reasonably nice, but walked around with zero smiles on their face.  Postive attitude is a must to work in that type of environment, people come out to have fun, not to have to deal with employees who are clearly not having a good time.   I'd love to work there, it's upbeat and would be engaged in giving customers the best experience."}
{"text":"So I have heard about this place a lot, friends rave about it and say how fun it is. So when I was able to check it out I was excited. Maybe it was because we went during the day or something but I really don't see what all the hype is about. There were a lot of people there so it wasn't dead, I was a little put off by the fact that all the bars were closed down so the only way to get a drink was to be in a bowling lane. 

I just wasn't as amazed as I thought I would be. Maybe when I'm in town again I'll check it out at night, hopefully its more exciting."}
{"text":"It looks cool but the place was full of suburban douchebags and the wait for a lane was over 1.5 hours.  I will not wait to bowl."}
{"text":"Did this place get lost on the way to old town Scottsdale? This place sucks. Save your money and bowl at a real alley. Too few lanes, expensive drinks and expensive bowling. Lastly, they endorse Mitt Romney...that says enough."}
{"text":"this place is so much fun!!!!!!!! we went here as part of my birthday celebration month. 

we had a mix up with our reservations which was a huge bummer but Rudy took such great care of us. he was super apologetic, bought all 12 of us a round of drinks while we decided what we wanted to do, gave us all free passes to the game room and comped our two lanes when they finally opened up. 

we almost left when we found out about the mix up but i am so glad we stayed. it was my first time there and because of the delay we got to enjoy the whole lucky strike experience. we got the games, the dance floor, the food, the drinking and the bowling in. 

i usually don't like bowling but this was such a blast. the service was great throughout the whole place. once we wrapped up our game we headed to copper blues. it was so nice having lots of fun things to do in one small area. 

highly recommend for parties and thumbs up to the amazing staff."}
{"text":"I have never been to a bowling alley before that has such a fun atmosphere. I am not even sure I would categorize it as just a boiling alley its really more of an upscale Dave and Busters that has bowling. The lanes are set up nicely with couches to get a relaxed feel the food was much better than a regular bowling alley the waitresses wear cute little outfits and if you don't want bowl they had an arcade, pool tables, and what looked like to be a dance floor at night... If you go during off hours the prices aren't too bad they have a special during the week that if you buy an entree you get free shoe rental and a free game of bowling then after that each game was $4 I believe. great place to do a team outing with your company or just get together with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Lucky Strike has lunch and a game of bowling for only $10.  The menu has recently changed for lunch, and the grilled cheese sandwich wasn't very good, however, I had such a good time taking an hour for lunch with friends, that this is still a 5 star review.  

Lucky Strike is most famous for its nightlife, but I prefer lunch for pricing and It wasn't very busy.  So we didn't have any problem getting any lanes for lunch.  

I am headed there again this week to show friends new to the valley.  I will trying the chicken sandwich, since it looked the best."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I don't like bowling. I'm just so AWFUL at it, that any time I spend in a bowling alley just gets less and less enjoyable as it goes on. I mean, how many hours can you spend being awful at something without hating yourself? And this is supposed to be fun?

Anyway, so we came here for a work function. We ordered pop, pizza, wings, some apparently amazing hot cheese dip and tortillas and salsa and guacamole. I really enjoyed the dairy-free pizza they made for me. It had a nice, light and thin crust, and the toppings were good. Wings were decent. Service was very friendly and quickly fixed an issue we had right off the bat (the drink glasses smelled heavily of cleaning solution). She continued being friendly and checking on us throughout our time there.

The seating is comfortable and amenable to hanging out and talking with people. The sofas are low, though, which means you're likely flashing people when you're on them, because your knees are higher than your butt, or you're flashing people while sitting on the stools, because your crotch is at eye level for people sitting on the sofa. I sat on the arm of the sofa. I can't really say how great the bowling is there (see above).

The atmosphere is pretty good, though, and if it were any other kind of place (not bowling) I'd probably return, but I'm just not that much of a masochist."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix is slowly maturing and that's a good thing.  The addition of activity based businesses like Lucky Strike will definitely increase the allure of driving downtown for something other than a Suns or Dback game (or the occasional concert)

We were fortunate enough to have a team building event at Lucky Strike to wrap up another great year of being Sprouties.  We spent the morning volunteering and working up an appetite at the UMOM center and then drove a couple of quick minutes to the center of town for some great food and awesome lanes in a super cool environment.

Clearly, Lucky Strike is primarily designed for team building events like ours, (we weren't the only team there).  It's relatively large, full bar menu, and we opted for appetizers (pizza, chicken satay, poppers, chips/salsa, bacon wrapped shrimp, etc.).  We're a pretty large group, about 50 of us and they had no trouble keeping the food coming, plenty to go around.  I'd give the food 3.5 stars, certainly edible with no grumbling from the team.  This isn't Peter Piper or Chuck E. Cheese type of microwaveable junk food, its actually very good and they have a working kitchen.  

And a full bar.  Did I mention the full bar?  I'm not much of a day drinker but its always comforting to know the option is there (I'm not a big fan of beer or wine so the option for a G&T or old-fashioned makes me happy-although good ice tea garners much the same respect.)

I hope we come back here next year, easy parking, cool shops in the area, and a metro Phoenix downtown that is starting to finally take shape."}
{"text":"Hosted a birthday party for my wife at Lucky Strike in April.  Had a nice event with decent service. Definitely nothing stellar.  After paying our deposit, we settled up in full at the end of the night, to the tune of several thousand dollars total.  Then, 4 months later, I received a phone call that I owed them another $700! I was a little alarmed that this business could be so poorly run that they can't even track their accounting correctly, and somehow discovered an additional $700 that they claim I owe them, over 4 months after squaring up in full...  Outrageous that a business could be so out of control.  I'd stay away!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only. We came here before a concert during happy hour (Sunday- Thursday) The drink prices were fantastic. They had several happy hour food options for $5. I got a flatbread & it was a full pizza! It was really good & enough to share. 

The bar was a nice area separate from the bowling area. The bartender was busy but still provided good service."}
{"text":"Forgot to update months ago, but I was contacted by management and offered a return visit on the house. As of yet I have not been able to take them up on the offer, but plan to shortly and this is why they now get a 4 star from me. It's the little things that count and they obviously take the concerns of their patrons seriously, which goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Awesome lanes. Cocktail server was a bit short with us. We enjoyed ourselves in spite of her."}
{"text":"Such a cool place and so glad to have it downtown at Cityscape!  They have a great happy hour with $3 wells and 1/2 price appetizers.  The pretzels with 3 dipping sauces are amazing and worth the visit alone!"}
{"text":"They claim to be a lounge, but it lacks a lot of substance.
We were there with our company and booked 3 lanes on a slow evening where only 6 lanes are occupied.
They let everybody wait for about 20 min., even with appointment.
You should think that 5 waiter could take care of 6 lanes, but we constantly had to look for our waitress and stop other waitresses to get her over. I don't want to know how a busy night looks like.
They charged an alcoholic drink the same amount (one voucher) as coffee, which makes it my most expensive coffee ever.
We had constantly problems on 2 of the 3 lanes, where strikes didn't count, the balls got stuck and other issues. Constantly brakes for the whole 3 hours!
We had a 'party planner' from lucky strike who was invisible for the whole evening, and as our time was up all lanes stopped in the middle of the games and we lost the counts without warning.
The food was ok, but not great.
One flaw followed the other and it was just frustrating.
Our boss was unhappy. For the price they charge you, you should be treated better, get better service and better quality of the equipment.
In short:
- crappy lanes
- slow staff
- overpriced items
We are not coming back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Damn Lucky Strike Lanes
Had me insane in the membrane
Downing Patron, tasted like propane
Dancing like I got an ankle sprain

Live DJ spinning
21 and over winning
Neon, glowing balls pinning
Munchie menu for the feigning

Great place to par-tay
Don't be tardy
If you want to be a smarty
Cz the crowds be mighty hearty

Sexy, urban-lounge atmosphere
Can't talk dirty in my BF's ear
Music and vibe is loud and clear
Tis okay cz his lips are near

I love nights like these
Where waitstaff is eager to please
Naughty intentions are here to seize
Like laugh, drink, or get a hickey

Time to bowl and kid it up
Let loose and cut it up
Or dance and fire it up

Adults only playground
After 7pm, no kids are found
Get ready to chow down
And clown around

Tequila Influenced Gutter balls and I'm out ;)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite before the game or the concert. They have a happy hour menu that has everything half off. We had 2 mini burgers and the chicken bites. Both were outstanding.

I'm not a drinker, but you can watch people bowl and watch the big game on the large screen TVs at the same time while you're eating."}
{"text":"If you advertise an industry night and I call about said night please inform us that there is a private party before 10 of us walk up expecting to bowl. When we call to make a reservation just tell us you are closed for the night before we all plan on being there."}
{"text":"Thank You SO Much Jacqueline!!!

Our friends enjoy Lucky Strike and wanted to have a little get together for a Birthday. The group consisted of more than 15 people. The two lanes were more than enough for all of us. There was a great seating area just behind the two lanes we reserved where the few that decided not to bowl were able to relax chit/chat and of course enjoy an adult beverage. 

The wait staff floated through the many lanes with ease which was much appreciated. I almost forgot to mention the fact that there were NO KIDS ALLOWED after 8:30pm!!!"}
{"text":"Great way to spend your workday lunch hour with good people.   Reccomend the veggie wrap."}
{"text":"We had a business group here in their VIP room for a sales promotion payout...the place itself it extremely impressive and food is delicious and that was about it. 
The service was horrible, the amount of food was lackluster at best - the servers kept putting all the food at the tables by the bowling lanes and the people not bowling basically went hungry. When I brought this up to one of the servers he was very resistant to bringing out more food, even to the point of 'checking' to see if he could - when we booked we were promised continuous food. 
The servers were not amazing and the bartender even worse. We had purchased drink tickets and also had opened up a tab at the bar, the bartender told our guests no drink tickets were required and basically ran up our tab at the bar. We had also purchased punches for the garage tickets to provide free parking for our guests, a good chunk of our guests ended up paying for their own parking. The bowling was a bit confusing over all and the guest check-in was not well run. It felt like everything could have been much more streamlined for the amount of money we spent. 
The worse part - their event coordinator asked how the event was and I responded honestly, I never received any response, apology, NOTHING! WOW, don't think we will ever fork out that amount of money for our guests to leave hungry and underwhelmed again."}
{"text":"I had a nongoing feud with Lucky Strike. That is, they didn't really know about it until about a year later but, on Facebook, I tried to dissuade people from going there because of their policy denying fashion defining jorts (mens jeans shorts). 

That said, Gabi and Jared invited us for a bowl/drink and all was forgiven when you go somewhere (ANYWHERE) with Royalty. 

I got so sloppy drunk. Gabi says we're serious bowlers, and while that may be true in the most proudly white trash sense, that night I could not see straight. Nor bowl. Jared likely benzodiazepined me. 

I would describe Lucky Strike like this: Scottsdale type crowd, very reasonably priced drinks, and very, very expensive bowling."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday early afternoon with two kids, ages 6 and 9. Didn't need a reservation because I think it only gets crowded in the late afternoon/evening. This is NOT 1980s bowling, people! Talk about posh, modern, clean, and awesome. It has a warm vibe, probably because it's pretty small. Great music, not overly loud. I will never look at bowling the same again! The \"bumpers\" for kids come up automatically for the kids' frames, which is pretty cool.  

Ordered some food for lunch that they serve right at your lane. Chicken pillows (basically chicken won tons), small burger slider things, a turkey club (with an egg in it! Love it!), and the gluten free green chile tacos. We all LOVED everything. The food is pretty great for \"sports bar\" type of food, but especially for a bowling alley. Had a couple of beers and wine, pretty good selection for both wine & beer. 

Played in the really upscale, modern arcade after bowling. It was empty, so that was great compared to the usual Peter Piper grossness/overcrowdedness of the weekends. I would happily pay more money to bowl, eat, and play games in style!! 

The best part probably is the free photo booth thing where you can put in your email address and it mails the photos to you. The photos are great - they are surprisingly high resolution for a free photo station. We captured a fantastic family photo that will be a great memory of our first time at Lucky Strike! It definitely won't be our last. Can't wait to have a kid party or adults night out here.

The staff was really helpful and the waitress was always coming back to our lane to check on us. Places like Lucky Strike remind me why I'm happy to be a Phoenician!"}
{"text":"I was so curious to go here because of all the hype associated with lucky strike. The bowling lanes weren't in the greatest condition. (If you are a bowler you will understand) their food was okay. Overall I don't know if I would go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced annoyance. The staff moves as if in slow motion and that they have never seen the computer screens before. The alleys are uneven (number 6 at least). The takeoff is short. The temperature was way to warm. If I wanted to sweat I'd have stayed outside. The waitresses were attentive but dressed like nerd sluts???? Why have a dress code for the customers if this is what you walk in too. Food was ok but not worth the money. Overall I'll pass. AMF or Brunswick have you beat hands down at a third of the price."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I'm sorry, but who can complain about a well-kept bowling alley with hot waitstaff (primarily female), good food and drink specials?  All in Central Phoenix?  Someone that clearly doesn't enjoy life enough- which, very luckily, is not me.  

I can ride my bike here.  I always have a great time.  Love."}
{"text":"Had the perfect girls night here last Friday. It has been years since I have been here and boy have I been missing out. The girls and I had a blast. We did not have reservations but had no problems getting our own lane. We played for two fun filled hours while munching on happy hour specials. The bar food was amazing we just kept them coming. Then the variety of drink options was the perfect blend for to please the girls. 

Zack was the guy who checked us in at shoes. He had so much personality and was a joy to work with. He helped us get started and was informative on what to do. Priscilla was our server at our lane. She was attentive and accommodating which really helped make our girls night. We will definitely be planning another fun filled night like this again."}
{"text":"Yup still a fan. I have been back here so many times and everyone really is pretty nice. I still have not bowled but I have watched others have a grand ole time at it. Me, I come for the yummy sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fries. Although I have had to send my fries back on a few occasions because they have come out either cold or not fresh, meaning that you can tell that they had been sitting out and they tried to re-fry them to make them fresh. FAIL! You try to pass out refried fries to a fry freak like me. Just won't work buddy but good try.

All in all, its a great place to come and hang out and eat and drink for pretty cheap. Maybe one of these days, I will actually bowl."}
{"text":"Bowling Lounge inside Vaughan Mills.  It definitely makes for a NEW bowling experience for some that know of bowling simply at a run-down Bowling Alley with malfunctioning lanes or OVER-USED bowling balls.

Imagine a Lounge then move that atmosphere over to a Bowling Alley.  Lounge lighting with soft spotlights and hip DESIGNS that makes it ENJOYABLE and RELAXING while you chat with others waiting until your turn to STEP UP.

LARGE screens just above the PINS make it easy to watch your favourite game and keep in the action at the same time.  Lounge Sofa Seats make it too comfy that you almost wish you're not the NEXT to Bowl.

There's a good sized DINING area that I've noticed is not as popular and it has been awhile since I've enjoyed a lunch here.  The menu consists of things that are no different than your average Sports Bar & Lounge a la WEGZ nearby.  The music selection fits the \"Fashionable Atmosphere\" as stated on their website."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  I love the bowling alley setting with the pool tables and two bars up front.  The connection to the Gypsy bar is fab.  The arcade is a great touch.  And the service is pretty fantastic.  The attitude of their employees is very personable which I like.  I hate going to a bar where the people just put your drink down and don't ever say a word.  I can sit at home and have a better conversation with my dog.  No seriously, my dog speaks on command.  Sounds something like rooo-ooohhh-oooo. And she changes it up, too.  It's much more entertaining than most places around town.  Lucky strike is definitely a great find."}
{"text":"I went to this place for free with an event. It is the coolest bowling alley I've ever been to. The drink that I had (deception) was alright, not good enough for its price(10$). The lanes have really cute graphics that change so you don't see that same thing over and over each time you make or don't make a strike. Every person who bowls gets a graphic popping up which is nice. The food is typical bar far and decent. Again nothing amazing but it fits the bill. 

There are a ton of people there and you can play pool. It feels like a bar that is also a bowling alley. The girl at the front has an accent and it was somewhat hard to understand her. I would go here again and pay this time!"}
{"text":"This review update is for the food only.  I ordered the short rib since I had not eaten a thing all day, so a hardy dish was what I was craving.  OMG!  I never would have imagined how good it would be.  The short rib melted in your mouth.  The Parmesan bread pudding was wonderful.  A little on the salty side, but I LOVE salt!"}
{"text":"Fuuuun! Ended up dropping a few hundred bucks but, that's fine. I had two kids with me one 27 and one 13 both had a lot of fun. Everyone was really nice the food was super good especially the corn dogs. I don't know what they put in the batter but the mini corn dogs are the bomb."}
{"text":"Generic Lucky Strike atmosphere.  Nice crowd."}
{"text":"A very fancy bar with different areas that makes them look like a totally different place, the main area has 2 pool tables a bar and infront of it several bowling lanes, it a has a very nice and fancy atmosphere, the other room it's divided in three areas, bathrooms, an arcade with lots of games and another bar with tables, dance floor and a stage where normally they have djs or bands (really cool area), prices are good and food is not that bad, i had garlic shrimp (only three shrimp and some vegetables) it was ok, then we asked for fries and they brought us some kind of flat bread with bacon and spinach, obviously it wasn't what we asked for but it was better than the shrimp, other than that i really liked the place, definitely i'm coming back."}
{"text":"We come in and everything's fine. The lane was still in the previous game and won't reset. We got 1 hour gme and the lane stopped working meanwhile counting our time. We called the manager and while we explain that it's counting the time and we are in a bit lack of it, she laughs at our faces and said she'll fix it when possible. A manager should understand how frustrated we are or offer something as an apology. We didn't even get a sorry. For $60 game of one hour plus shoes. Definitely not worth it. Don't come."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. It was a crowded night so service was a bit slow but I expected that. Food was good though. Drinks were even better and who doesn't love Bowling!
Fun place to go with friends."}
{"text":"We went to an event here and were lucky to be in the VIP area for the evening.  It was lots of fun, good food and bowling here!   The margaritas were fabulous and reasonably priced (as to be expected downtown).  Servers and bartenders were friendly and helpful.  

Awesome ambiance here, great place for parties, events, big groups, etc!    Close to some other great spots downtown for a fun night out too - swing by Copper Blues next door or catch the late Stand Up Live comedy show - makes for a fun night in downtown PHX!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to check this place out...anything to make Phoenix a better place to live. But it was very disappointing. We made a reservation which they lost. The receptionist at the front desk was unapologetic and acted helpless. Our waitress was terrible. A young Russian girl with short blond hair who didn't smile, didn't make eye contact, and didn't want to take our order. I guess it was the end of her shift because before we could complain, Nicole came on shift. She was the best thing about our whole experience. She was prompt and friendly. The manager, Buddy, did come over to apologize about our reservation, apparently the girl who took our request made it for the wrong day...he stated this was not the first time this had happened. BTW we received nothing complimentary for our inconvenience and their lack of customer service. Don't waste your money...go to a real bowling alley. Also, the bathrooms were sad."}
{"text":"Super swanky and lots of fun with great happy hour and just ok service, but spendy.  

The place is absolutely beautiful!  It's the loveliest bowling alley I've ever seen - basically a plush lounge with lanes.  I've been here many times with different people and it's always fun.  Our most recent visit was on a weekday afternoon, and the prices are much lower (I can't remember exactly how much, and the website doesn't seem to have this info).  After several rounds of bowling, we paid $9/hour for the pool table, which isn't bad if you play fast - and it is pro-rated so you only py for the time you use.

This also seems to be a popular venue for large groups and special occasions.  We've even been to a birthday party where we just got drinks at the bar and didn't bowl.

So why not 5 stars?  It's pretty expensive for what is ultimately still bowling, and the service isn't great (they seem to attract a high percentage of  \"I'm doing you a huge favor by dealing with you at all\" staff).

My advice?  Go on a weekday and catch Happy Hour - on weekends, the prices are more than it's worth, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times for lunch, happy hour & birthday gatherings...fun atmosphere and great place to gather, but I've been to better places to for food. They usually have decent live bands on the weekends and serves as a great place to launch your weekend. A fun place to kick back & relax with some room to get a lil dance on, but not a total dance floor availabe. Go in, get your drink on & kick back to some music and enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's been over 2 years since I was in Lucky Strike Phoenix... it impressed me then and it impressed me last night. We booked 2 lanes for a 30th birthday party. We had a great time... the service when checking in, our food/drinks, the lane server... were all super friendly, GREAT and made for an awesome night for us.  They also expanded since I was there so the added bars and game room were a big plus for our 10person group. Had a great time and would recommend going to anyone who wants to do something fun in phoenix that goes way beyond just a bar. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the drinks, the bowling lanes, the couches, the gaming areas, the pool tables, the place is done well. The prices are great and the atmosphere is fun for both kids and adults. 

I have spent a few great date nights with the husband here. Its also close to some great other restaurants and bars in downtown phoenix. The two story approach is fun as well."}
{"text":"So showed up here on a Saturday night, wearing a t-shirt and basketball shorts ready to bowl. Well to say the least I was denied entry due to my attire. When I asked to speak to a Manager they sent the Assistant Manager Rudy, who when I met him explained I was just here to bowl, I was not interested in going into Gypsy Bar. He said that it was \"an UPSCALE bowling alley\" and my attire was not acceptable. I could understand the dress code if I was some punk kid off the street. But I am 38 and I was with two friends who are also my age. When I explained to him that as a manager he should be able to make a managerial decision and let me slide. Being that I have worked in the industry for the last 20 years being a manager and a VIP host at some real UPSCALE venues...Cajun House of Blues, Cat Eye Lounge, and the GM of Jackrabbit Lounge in Scottsdale for 3 years, and am currently the Director of Operations at another Phoenix venue. He still declined. To say the least, he obviously has no concept of customer service, or how to make a decision that would probably be more beneficial to his business. We ended up going to Let it Roll Bowl. No dress code, no problems, and made the best of it. I will never go to this business again and per this review, suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"I used to have such a good time here. The bartender and DJs were always so friendly and down to earth. Great music and atmosphere. So why an I giving it one star? I have multiple sclerosis and my walking is a little wobbly. The manager or owner came from the back and kicked me out. He said that I was too drunk and I needed to leave. I hadn't even gotten my drink yet. I tried explaining that I have ms and he didn't want to hear it. He made me cry and embarrassed me in front of my wife and friends saying i walk like I'm drunk. Btw  this was October 2014."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place is hood to the max, I went there with my wify and the crowd there were really bad. 20+ guys on 2 lanes with only 4 paid players , no bowling shoes, throwing the ball in other people's lanes, management is non existent. I complained 3 times to no luck, even the lanes are not 100% flat, the ball almost always steers to the left. After 2 long and miserable games I leave (closing time) an employee comes up to me (I'm thinking they finally gonna apologize this Jane and finch atmosphere and lack of customer service) but instead she asks me for a cigarette. Inside the hall even before I exit the hall, sadly for her (who by the way looked like female and skinny version of SideShowBob from The Simpsons) I'm not a smoker. So I had nothing to offer her. But if you feel the urge to  vising Jane and Finch, just go to Lucky Strike, from customers and employees to lack of professionalism, its your 1 stop experience."}
{"text":"When I walked in to Lucky Strike, I immediately noticed the bar to my left. It was  a very long bar with a ton of stools as well as a few tables. I almost liked the bar area more than the bowling area, because it was so roomy. The lanes, on the other hand, were pretty ridiculously crowded.

First off, there weren't that many lanes. While there were also several pool tables in the building, the actual bowling area was pretty small, with only a dozen lanes. Each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes, but to get by everyone at your lane, you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls. It was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super-close to the people you're with.

Also, while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes, one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art. I much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing (which were not good, by the way-Jamiroquai, seriously?!). The whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip.

The crowd there, surprisingly, was mostly suits who probably came straight from work. I was surprised the place was as busy as it was. While our lane waitress was super-friendly, service was really slow, and someone in our party said it almost would have made more sense just to walk to the bar ourselves for drinks.

Prices vary depending on times and days, but if you're going to bowl Friday and Saturday nights after 6 p.m., it'll cost a whopping $39.95 per lane per hour. That, to me, is ridiculous when so many other lanes have unlimited cosmic bowling (with good music and music videos) for only $20 a person. Don't go to Lucky Strike-try Scottsdale Lanes instead."}
{"text":"Cool place... I don't bowl but a friend had a b-day party here. Liked the setup, I'd go back."}
{"text":"The waitstaff was outstanding! Really friendly and made sure we had what we wanted. They were also really accomodating with us bringing our own birthday cake- providing us with plates & silverware. 

The bowling itself was great fun, but getting to that point was a real hassle. Trying to reserve 2 lanes the Saturday before Christmas was difficult (even though I started trying like 3 weeks ago), but they managed to accomodate us for an hour before their contracted parties came in- but this took persistence with a few phone calls and schedule juggling with my party time. 

The most annoying part was trying to get started bowling once we got there. They wouldn't let us pay until right when we were to get started. I was told beforehand to come in 15 minutes before our reserved time to get set-up with the names & shoes but what actually happened was once I paid, our hour started (although I did have time to try and guess all of the people that would show so they could enter the lineup). We had to rush to get our shoes, the names were already ready entered on the lineup and we had to shuffle to get things rolling. It was a bit chaotic.

If reserving lanes in advance here, I would definitely recommend that you know exactly how many are showing up & make sure they are all there on time. There really isn't any flexibility for latecomers or unexpected guests.

Also, finding it was a little difficult- we had to cut through the CVS and then go upstairs. And they say they validate parking, but keep in mind, it's only for an hour.

We ended up staying after our bowling finished, and found the lounge to be really comfortable. It was happy hour and the prices were great for the food they served. The food was really good- we had the macaroni & cheese bites (bite sized triangles, not too greasy), pretzel sticks (soft & fresh with 3 dipping sauces) & sliders (really flavorful).

Overall, I liked the place and  would love to come back-- but without the pressure of trying to throw a party."}
{"text":"It's loud, it's crazy, it's SO FUN!!! I enjoy bowling but this is so much more. We had some wine and a couple appetizers while I destroyed my wife in bowling (snicker). It's a bit tough to get in so be sure to call first and make a reservation, if you can. Mostly good for the family. I mean, there's drinking, and semi-tightly-dressed waitresses and such but it's really not too bad IMHO. Our waitress was new in town and we had all these great conversations about the area. She made some perfect food suggestions and was super awesome in every way. A great place to go, I promise!

If you can bring enough people with you to book both lanes in your little booth area, I would suggest that. We shared our booth with this other group we didn't know and they were nice and all but kept making out with each other (there were 3 couples) right in front of our table. Of course, our table faced their lane. A little off-putting but not enough to not come back. Next time though, we will book in advance and make sure to bring non-make-out-in-front-of-you type friends. lol!"}
{"text":"The place was so cool, it's too bad service was very slow. I mean very slow! I was so dry I kept having to go to the bar for 'help yourself water' and had a few waters while waiting for my drink."}
{"text":"Shouldn't be compared to other bowling companies! Classy, well AC'ed, good vibes, good food... They have about 10 lanes & also have an arcade."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a birthday gathering.

I was pretty impressed with this place:
A) Along with the bowling area, there's a bar with pool tables, and a lounge section with a window facing the lanes where you can people watch.
B) A live DJ played songs and mixed videos on the screens throughout the establishment. I liked the songs he was playing, and also takes requests if you want to hear something specific or change the genre.
C) The waitresses are attentive, and don't mind splitting checks. Make sure you tell them beforehand to avoid any confusion.

**Bonus Points**
Rack City came on, and one of the girls bowling next to us bent over and made her booty clap. I didn't even need to give her a dollar!

So, why only three stars?! Well, there's one REALLY big caveat to this place. Everything was clean with exception to the men's bathroom. It smelled like urine. Not just ordinary urine, but the kind you piss out when you've been drinking a little too much. GROSS. Annnnd it's all over the floor. Management -- please do something about this.

As long as you avoid the bathroom (if you're a man), you'll have fun here."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is the VIP room sexy as hell?  I love this place.

This Mamacita can hit pins, let me tell ya.  I love bowling but bowling alleys can be so disappointing.  Not this place.  I had one of the best times ever at this alley.  The service was great, everyone was helpful and attentive.  Drinks were concocted to perfection.  The music was great - we were dancing around, good times.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and great food for any bowling event.  Attended a company function which included a buffet style serving.  The pizza, nachos, and mini burgers-buffalo chicken sandwiches were great.  The chicken skewers along with the other appetizers served that evening (cheese poppers) were a great compliment.  Plenty to do, whether you want to play video games, play skee ball, bowl, or play pool.  Fun times!!"}
{"text":"Wow when my friend said we got VIP to bowl I wasn't too impressed.  When I got here I was totally 180'd.  Hot waitresses, disco bowling, DJ spinning, loungin' on the couch and clubbers dancin' away.  There was free food & drinks all night woohoo!! (Granted VIP night before grand opening).  Still the place was popping.  The bowling system was off the chart and high tech - yeah it was for bowling.  Located in CityScape; this is definitely gonna be the next hot spot in downtown PHX.  Which is great since downtown is so lacking in the night life!  As for the food man it was good.  Not your typical slider I tell ya.  The ambience is just right - how they got that high-end bowling and bar lounge to work??  Beats me but  it does; I'm gonna have my birthday here! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for this place a week in advance. left a voicemail and the host gave me a call back right away and reserved my party.That's a plus! We came a little bit late because we were driving in from California but we were only 15 mins late. however the host still allowed us to keep the reservations. Another plus! 

The clerk , did a poor job in explaining the rules. When we walked in at 9:30 She told us that we could play as many games within the hour. when you purchase time. But they didn't make us finish our game nor did they make us finish our time. So I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager and he (Kevin Stone) took his own sweet time to come speak to us while he was talking on the phone. It was soo long that we had to walk up to him and stare at him for 5 more mins until he noticed that we were standing there. 

However,   recently the Marketing Coordinator or lucky strikes contacted me on yelp and was really sorry about my incident. She agreed to give me 2 hours of play time back.  

That  was great on their part. Lucky strikes has definately changed my mind about there customer service. The marketing rep has gone above and beyond and I really appreciated that establishment. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. 

Kudos to Lucky Strikes and looking forward to giving them another chance.!!"}
{"text":"A place where the beer is as cold as the Rockies and lanes as smooth as a baby's bottom. Bowled a personal best here (116). Ask for Stephen Best behind the bar--that guy knows how to make a banana daiquiri! (Extra bananas) 

Not a bad place to watch \"the game,\" but they wouldn't let me bring my pet squirrel (DeAnthony) inside. He misbehaves, so that's probably a good call on their part. 

They stack the nachos high at this place. And I didn't have a serious violent episode the whole time I was here. 

5 out of 5 would recommend."}
{"text":"Very clean bowling alley that accommodates people ranging from families with small children to those looking to drink and have a good time. The only downfall is downtown parking but don't go to a downtown spot if paid parking is an issue for you!"}
{"text":"What I love best about this place, is that when you are hanging out in the VIP room and your gazing out of the huge wall of windows, you feel like you might be in New York for a second.

I wouldn't say this place is really a bowling alley, but more of just a club, but it is still a fun place to go. I didn't have to pay for anything when I was here because I was a company party, so I can't say if I would have paid for this again, but I did have a good time while I was there.

The drinks were pretty weak, but the food was pretty good and the atmosphere is fun. Plus there is a lot of great places in walking distance."}
{"text":"I heard that Lucky Strike opened downtown several months back, but I'm not a huge bowler, so I didn't really think twice about it.  However, a few weeks ago, Jared got it in his head that he really wanted to go there...  So last Friday night, while at dinner, we texted Amber and Dallas  to see if they spontaneously wanted to join us for  drinks and bowling at Lucky Strike... and sure enough, they did!  (Gotta love the spontaneity!)

Unfortunately for us, we weren't the only ones in the mood to check out Lucky Strike; the place was packed with an hour wait when we arrived!  We stuck it out though, and despite being on the pricey side, we did end up having a ton of fun!  

A couple of rounds of drinks later, we finally did get a chance to bowl.  I was by far the worst bowler in our lane; (bowling is not my sport even sober).  Little known fact: Amber and Dallas are pretty serious bowlers... they both have their own bowling balls at home but they didn't bring them out with us this time.  

I am sure I'll return to Lucky Strike; I think it's a great new addition to CityScape downtown, but next time  I'll call ahead to reserve a lane... and I may even try to brush up on my bowling skills before I return (or not)!"}
{"text":"I refuse to think of myself as a crappy bowler, in-fact, according to my Wii I'm one of the best that's ever shoved two fingers and a thumb into a ball...I will instead believe that their bowling lanes are imbalanced. I know it had nothing to do with my \"let's try one of everything on the drink menu\" flight. I was tilted, sure, but I blame gravity. 

The flatbread appetizer was scrumptious, just as the server said it would be. The tempura vegetables were pretty good too, although I ended up peeling off the breading and just eating the veggies...great flavor! 

After playing a few games, we decided we just wanted to sit  (besides, the bowling was getting kinda pricey and we're really trying to give this \"frugal\" thing a whirl (yeah, we suck at it, but it can only get better right?), watch some sports and have a few more tasty beverages...this is where the stars got taken away.

The bar area was HELLA UNFRIENDLY! I couldn't even believe how pissy the clientele were, and the bartender was nowhere to be seen (probably scared off by those mean-mugging brutes hogging the good seats in front of the game)...no biggy, there are other bars with TVs out there. We'll *probably* go back to bowl at some point, but aren't in a big hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Easily the sweetest bowling alley in the state of AZ, love this place. The game room may be smaller but it's full of good stuff. The service is excellent and the decor and furniture really make the place, who's ever waited between turns bowling while sitting on couches?"}
{"text":"Staff there is not exactly eager to accommodate you.  All young females between 19 and 25 except management.  And all act like entitled millennials Who seem angry they actually have to work for a living.   They didn't have my prepaid lane reservation and I had to produce documentation, there was a dispute over shoe costs, etc.  however the facility is beautiful and first class, and the food is good for a bowling alley.  So it balances out.  Bad service but good facility."}
{"text":"I went to Lucky Strike last week for a work outing. I had never been before so I was excited to check it out. It is definitely fancier than the VFW-like bowling alleys I'm used to. 

Full bar & food options were great. The servers were all really nice & super quick with drink orders. There were so many places to sit or stand it never felt overly crowded, which was really nice. Even the music was awesome! 

Not sure on pricing, but I can only assume it's pricey since it's so nice. It'd be a fun place to go back with a group of friends, though!"}
{"text":"Five stars for having the best meal value with recreational outlet during the lunch hour.  Your lunch outing will get you a great meal and a free game of bowling for only $5.50. Srsly!

I've done the lunch & bowl three times and each visit was easy breezy, just stick to the following:

Most people are there during their lunch hour so show up a little early to guarantee access to the next available lane. Sign up for your lane immediately upon arrival and order your meal as soon as your server checks in with you. Keep your game going and avoid stalling and lingering. Believe me, two players can get through a game and lunch within 45 minutes. Most importantly, just have fun!"}
{"text":"Went to Lucky Strike again and was very happy with my visit.  The staff, especially Johnny, was amazing. Will be back.  My last visit was rough but I have changed my mind and will recommend to my friends. Thank you Lucky Strike for an awesome time!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sat. afternoon for a 4 year old birthday party . . . can you say 'swanky' and 'cool'?!  The atmosphere there is the bomb! Apparently, for one set price per child, they will be unlimited refills of drinks and food for the party~ which is perfect if you have teenagers who don't blink twice at having 10 hot dogs!
 
We had a table laddened with hot dogs, fries, pizza, popcorn, potato chips~ talk about a kid's food heaven! 

We were situated at the last lane which was perfect, the kids could run around safely while the adults lounged around and have adult conversation.  They have a full menu and full bar to satisfy any adult's appetite.

I took a tour of the place and became very excited by the vibe of the place (sleek, modern, new, clean . . . ) that I wanted to bring all of my friends here to have a good time that I texted a group of my friends right then and there about having a night out!

The waitresses were great~ very friendly and told me that on Friday and Saturday nights the a DJ comes and spins cool tunes~ she says the place gets packed so make sure to make reservations for a lane. (They have pool tables too.)

What a great addition to downtown Phx . . . would not be surprised if Tarantino shoots a scene at this lounge . . . this place is that cool."}
{"text":"I haven't been as offended or embarrassed as I was tonight in a long time. I am downtown for a company conference and wanted to go bowling and play pool with a few friends. Upon coming up the escalator and walking up, I started taking out my wallet to get my ID. There were 4 guards at the door and one looked at me and said \"you look like you've had one too many. I can't let you in.\" We honestly thought he was joking. I was stone cold sober and for the life of me cannot understand why I was refused entrance. No reason was given other than \"you look drunk\" despite my friends saying I wasn't. I'm a 32 year old mother, out while I enjoy the fact that I have a babysitter for once. I'm responsible. I AM NOT going to go out and be publicly intoxicated wandering downtown. Your doormen were unprofessional and I am embarrassed and disappointed that my evening ended that way. I'd like to think that if people are being vetted for intoxication, people who are acting as I was would NOT be denied entrance. I hope maybe you can provide some training to your employees or, at the very least, issue an apology to me."}
{"text":"Been to LS in Phoenix a few times. Everything from a party of 25 (with kids) to a group of 4 entertaining out-of-towners.

Each time was a success but that success comes with a price. 

The bowling  is expensive. $40 per hour for the lane plus shoes; we dropped $60 before we even ordered our first drink. That being said, you're paying for atmosphere and the decor is great, as is the service. Very attentive and they seemed nonplussed by the children running around. That's always nice (sometimes you just have to bring them along and kids love to bowl, right?)

Their menu is impressive as well. When my foodie friends come to town and decide against bowling because they hate \"bowling alley food\", this is a great option because this is definitely a few notches above typical alley fare! My favorite items are the Pretzel Dippers and the Chicken Pillows. Burgers are quite tasty as well. My husband had a salad that was spicy and satisfying. Food and drink prices are reasonable.

I've never been to their happy hour, but am planning an outing in the near future!"}
{"text":"Went to Lucky Strike in Phoenix for the second time after my wedding reception last month...yes I bowled in my wedding dress! The staff was wonderful. They gave everyone in our party free shoe rentals and they game me a free dessert. The drink specials from 9-close are awesome. You won't find much better in downtown phoenix. The place is decorated great and has a really cool vibe. Even if you are not bowling, it is a fun place. Also, the manager/owner used to be my sister's soccer coach and he is awesome. They are a little particular about reserving lanes (can't reserve for Saturday until the Wednesday before) but I definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"After attending an elite event a few months ago, we were given \"Lucky Strike Experience\" tickets. I decided to use my two tickets last night. On the phone, Kristie was sweet when taking my reservations.

When our party of four arrived, we get full VIP treatment. Luckily, the place wasn't crowded so that was nice. The manager (I want to say her name is Nicole) was funny and friendly. She made sure that we were taken care of. Because we were using two tickets, we got 2 hours of bowling for four, free shoe rental for four, and four appetizers! 

We ordered the Short Rib Nachos, the Artichoke and Spinach dip, the chicken bites (chili sesame), and mac and cheese bites! Holy Moly - it was so much food for four people. However, we went at it with the food like we haven't eaten for days! My favorite - the chicken bites hands down!

The whole party had so much fun! Thank you, Lucky Strike for giving me and my party the ultimate \"LUCKY STRIKE EXPERIENCE\"!"}
{"text":"Dropped in with some friends.  The lanes were all taken, so we went over to the pool tables to play some pool.  They were busy too, so a couple of us went over to try and 'win' a table from people who were there.  I normally enjoy playing pool, but didn't feel like it on this particular evening.

The pool tables seemed to be in good shape and there is adequate room, but with people walking by, it can get a bit annoying to deal with them interfering with the shot.....the traffic flow can be improved.

There's a bar area with a lounge on the side of the bowling alley and the floor of the alley is eye level, so it's kind of cool to watch the bowling action from that vantage point.

Overall, it's a pretty cool place.  Would like to come back again.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service ever. It's neither a fun place to bowl or to drink, so what's the appeal? The food? No. Disgusting. Don't even bother. It's cramped and kind of smells."}
{"text":"When I heard that Lucky Strike was opening in downtown I was thrilled to see something so big move into the area. A little bit of big city in our own downtown metropolis. But after my experience there lats night I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. I went for a small group birthday party, and upon walking in I thought the place was fantastic. Once we were seated and in our lane the waitress came over and took our drink orders fairly quickly. It took almost half an hour for her to return with our drinks and food. The food was already cold by the time it had gotten to us and our drinks were pretty watery. Our lane had some kind of problem, which took them ten-fifteen minutes to fix (which in my opinion when you are paying by the hour those 15 minutes really add up). While we were waiting for them to come over and fix it and waited for our server to come over and refill drinks, we watched the staff bowl, dance and play pool. I'm in the service industry as well, and when you are paying top notch for bowling I expect great costumer service. I understand that Lucky Strike is new and that there are still a few kinks to work out, I just expected so much more for the price I paid and for the experience I had. I think they should reevaluate their managerial skills and take a class in costumer service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"They rush you into a game. The hostess at the front talks as fast as she can and rushes people to the pay counter, making it sound incredibly cheap. Make it sound like its gonna be 9$. When you get to the pay counter the chart with the pay prices is hidden behind a bush, and the guy at the counter clicks a few buttons and charges you and asks for your card. He tried to charge us for the late hour game price, and I caught it after I found the sign. He didn't even know what to charge people. Then he springs it on us that the game price is per person, or we could pay the 40$ hourly rate. We begrudgingly pay and are whisked off to an alley. All in all one game of bowling came to 17$. 17$??? Dont go here. You can't even hear yourself think over the subwoofer and the screens above the pins are distracting."}
{"text":"I went to Lucky Strike on Saturday Night.  This review is more about the feeling I got than any particular aspect or event there.  With one exception, my bartender was absolutely my favorite bartender of all time.  (If you are reading this you make the best iced tea ever!)  

We get there about 7:30 and had to wait about half an hour for a lane.  No problem, it's Saturday at 7:30 on opening weekend.  I kind of expected a longer wait.  We all sit down at the bar, order some drinks, and grab a bite to eat.  I had a club sandwich (not so great), friends had a pizza (they seemed to like it), and the last of our foursome had the pretzels sticks (I stole one and loved it).  The drinks were good and seemed well mixed.  I generally just drink bourbon on the rocks, so it doesn't take a genius,  but the pour VERY generous.  

When our TGI McManahan's beeper goes off we head on over to the front desk to claim our lane.  It wound up being about 20 per person for shoes and and the lane.  By the way.  Try not to go anywhere you need to rent shoes with a guy well over 6 feet...Size 14? really?

There were some issues with my friends changing over the bar tab but these things happen with an opening weekend.  The music had some high points but over all was a little disappointing.  The waitresses were attentive.  I bowled like crap.  That about sums up the facts.  Oh wait.  The place is done very well as far as decor.  

I will definitely be back but I don't see myself making it a weekly trip.  Maybe every other month."}
{"text":"James is the sh*t! He's a funny guy, he ran our food and kept conversation with us :). My complaint is: the draft beer is watered down and I ordered a red bull vodka, uhh where's the alcohol ?? The cheeseburger minis and nachos were great!!! Just be careful of alcohol :/"}
{"text":"We went to watch an MMA fight and it was great, the food was good, the service was good and the atmosphere was great.  We would have bowled but all the lanes were booked, which is a good sign.

I really like this place and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is a bit on the high side in terms of price but you are mostly paying for the atmosphere of the place, not really the bowling.  I agree with others that it is not totally geared towards bowling.  The inside is great but the service can be a bit slow.  I'd rather go somewhere a bit less fancy and just focus on the bowling aspect."}
{"text":"After I left my last review I was contacted the next day by the General Manager in regards to my experience. It is obvious our service on Saturday was not up to their standards and the quick response and handling by the GM is refreshing. We all have those days at work that we aren't 100% and I am quite sure that our server was just having one of those days. We will as they say in bowling terms \"rerack\" this one and give it another try.  I have updated my last review to 4 stars based on managements efforts to be sure that our issues were addressed."}
{"text":"I came here as part of a large social event with friends. Compared to another Lucky Strike I've been to in Seattle, this location was very spacious and open. I didn't get to go bowling but the floor and lanes looked very clean. The bartenders working that Friday night near the back of pool tables was very attentive. Her service was flawless. Getting a drink had never been so easy. The only criticism I had was that the dance floor seemed small but then again that's not a primary focus of a bowling alley."}
{"text":"I had a great time last night! And all the other times I've visited this fun and swanky place. 

Happy Hour is a must, it will get you right. 

And if you're not a drinker or tire of it after 3 shots and about 5 regular drinks (at that wonderful Happy Hour price created by the gorgeous and hilarious bartenders), there's the lanes and pool tables to get things physical. And plenty of screens to watch mostly every game (unless you're Giants fan like myself, then no game for you!) to be not so physical.

We will be back as soon as we can! Never a dull moment and the crowd is a fun crowd no matter who's there. And such a great addition to the oddly slow building up of Downtown Phoenix's nightlife. About time!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great. The whole atmosphere is unique. Bowling, bars, dj - it's an awesome idea. Only thing is on a Friday, it's super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane."}
{"text":"one word rude, called and wanted to leave a message for a call back and was hung up on."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to hang out and listen to some good mix of techno music. The food is good but the bartenders really suck, worst service I have ever seen, after you get your 1st drink they ignore you after til you hell and flag them down, and this is when the bar is empty, I can imagine getting a drink when they have 20 ppl inside. I suggest going for the atomism here and not the drinks. I only gave it three star because of the dive atmosphere if it wasn't for that they would have gotten 1 star. It is a bowling place but only have 4-5 lanes and don't bowl on a weekend here it will cost you $50 hr. So you be the judge I guess."}
{"text":"Wanted to post this update to say how impressed I was with the service we received for our recent party at Lucky Strike. Our company had a Big Lebowski/bowling themed retreat day and about 20 of us hopped on the party bus and headed over to Lucky Strike for lunch and a bowling tournament. We had four lanes reserved for our party and at least two dedicated staff members taking drink orders and making sure everything went smoothly at our buffet style lunch spread. I'm sure I am forgetting some of the food items, but the boneless wings, salad, pizza, and club sandwiches went over really well. I personally LOVED the nacho bar too. The only thing that didn't wow me was the bbq chicken sliders, I think it was the bun that tasted off. 

So a big huge thank you to the staff for being so friendly and attentive, and for putting up with some crazy and a few really loud drunk people on a Thursday afternoon :)"}
{"text":"Came here one evening as a birthday celebration with a group of 10. My s/o and I are fairly regular bowlers, with our own gear and such, so in terms of how a bowling alley operates we have a good idea of what's good and what isn't. While most bowling alley's tend to be on the older, dingier side, this bowling alley is quite impressive with an almost nightclub-level atmosphere. They have pool tables, a nice bar, good seating, sound, and plenty of tv's, great lights for cosmic bowling, and a large back area where they were hosting a sort of lip sync battle type event when we arrived. However, from a bowling perspective, this alley sucks. The lanes have no oil and chewed our balls up - they were covered in tough-to-remove glue-like residue, probably from the ball return. It was impossible to bowl well without oiled lanes, but the worst part were the technical difficulties that plagued our entire experience. The lanes have tv monitors and kiosks to enter information, yet apparently the kiosks to enter the info are just for show because we couldn't enter our names or make any adjustments when there were issues. We had to call someone over or go to the desk each time there was an issue, which kept happening the entire night. There were issues with the pins falling down after being reset, scores being wrong, people having to roll three times in one frame and the first roll not counting, and at one point the lane got completely stuck and we just got moved to an entirely new lane. Even if you were totally bowling for fun and didn't care about the lanes not being oiled, you couldn't even get an accurate sense of how you were doing with all the scoring inconsistencies and problems with the reset of the pins. Ultimately this was a frustrating experience for those of us who were regular bowlers and those of us who weren't. I would not return to bowl here again."}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times and have always had less than thrilling experiences, but the last time (last week) was really bad. We went for a friends birthday and had two lanes reserved. We were all ordering drinks it it took the waitress forever to get to us - despite the place not being THAT busy. Our first round of drinks came back all wrong and many were absolutely disgusting. Multiple drinks were sent back time and time again as they tasted as if they were being made by someone totally inexperienced. The manger came over and was still extremely unhelpful. I would skip this place if you are looking for good service and decent drinks."}
{"text":"Only 8 lanes and they are over priced.
Hate the concept of reserving lanes.
Decent music and crowd."}
{"text":"Rude and incompetent staff and miserable experience overall. 

A group of girlfriends and I made the mistake of having a bachelorette party here. It was a miserable experience. The least of my complaints is that this location is outrageous for what it is. 6 of us shared one lane for 2 hours and it was over $150 just for the cramped lane. My real complaint is with the waitstaff and management. First off, we couldn't get the waitstaff to clear a dish or bring a refill to save their lives. Our tiny half a table was literally cluttered with classes and plates ALL NIGHT even when they are empty. At the end of the night the waitress LOST a credit card from our group. Lost it. Literally lost it. When we told management we were told \"we are sorry, you won't be charged for anything, go home and cancel the card.\" Fine, fair enough. Accidents happen. After we left we come to find out that credit card was charged TWICE on two different bills. Obviously the waitress gave our card to someone else. 

Here is my real complaint however: The waitstaff and the manager were and insensitive to our group. We were not drinking, for whatever reason we were not drinking. On two separate occasions waitstaff came over and offered us shots. When we refused they made snide comments like \"oh, a dry party?\" \"well thats no fun\". That is incredibly rude. At one point the manager came over and offer congratulations to our bride, and offered to give us a round of shots. He made an obvious comment about a member of our party being pregnant, and we told him that no, we were not drinking, He paused and said, \"oh, well...then there isn't anything i can do for you. When you're ready to drink, come see me.\" How ridiculous!!!! We all bought sodas and all bought food. You couldn't buy the table one appetizer or at least sodas? And how insensitive and rude. We decided to come all the way out to your establishment, pay your ridiculous prices for a tiny lane, and then we get insulted? Are you kidding me? 

Rude. Incompetent. Miserable."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere. I love the food and the drink combinations. I have yet to actually go bowling here but I hope I can some time. I wish things were a bit cheaper for what you get but the taste is wonderful. Always a great crowd of people. Hard to talk in but fun to hang out!"}
{"text":"This isn't your typical bowling alley. I've been to a Lucky Strike location in Houston but this was my first time checking out one in Phoenix. We went to a Suns game Saturday evening and were looking to go out and have some drinks after the game. Lucky Strike was the second spot on our night out. They have bowling of course, but there's more than you would expect. They also have an arcade area with 10 or so games including Pac-Man, a driving game, basketball, and more. 

What was really unexpected is that a portion of Lucky Strike is also a club! There's lounge seating, a good-sized dance floor, and a DJ. A long bar is close to the dance floor so you can fill up with ease. Service was a little slow when it got packed but not too bad. By the time midnight rolled around, there was a lot of people on the dance floor so it was a pretty hype atmosphere."}
{"text":"I guess I just had really high expectations, so I feel like I would have usually given this four stars, but because I had built it up in my head, it's only a three. 

I went there for my party, and invited about 10 friends to come bowl with me. The pricing was pretty legitimate, and they still have new shoes and shiny new lanes. We went at 5pm and it was EMPTY. They said they had a big lunch rush, but I'm sure things are still picking up here. Everyone in my party got served on time and with appropriate happy hour orders, but I had my order screwed up a few times. And there were drinks that were brought out that no one had, and some of the servers (I think we had 5?) were confused. HOWEVER, I know that they're still learning, and that they're working out the kinks on their food and their service. I guess I just expected a lot more pretty early in their lifespan.

The bowling - well it was awesome. I love Lucky Strikes and will hopefully go again, but I'm waiting for their service to be worked out a bit more, and then I'll review again and go for a 4-star review!"}
{"text":"This past weekend I had my birthday party at Lucky Strike and it was a great time. I rented to bowling lanes and there were about 17 people. The manager got us all set up and checked in a few times. Our server was great also. Once we were done we wanted to extend our time but there were other people already waiting for our lanes. So the manager set us at a pool table and even gaves us prepaid caeds for the arcade since we weren't ready to leave. I will definitely be back again. Also happy hour is everyday from 3-7pm and the food is good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come to this place after listening to my boyfriend brag about it so much. We love bowling and billiards as it is, but this was a different scene and we wanted to have some fun. I was so disappointed from the moment we chased our waitress down for a couple glasses of water until we left. After waiting 10 minutes to ask for the water, we had to wait 10 more for it to be delivered. Maybe the waitress was overwhelmed with her 3 other groups, no biggie. But when we wanted to order some food we had to chase her down, again. After ordering some food she decided to bring our check to the table, without asking if we wanted to order anything else, which we did, by the way. So after that we got the memo that our business wasn't wanted and waited to finish our game of bowling. As we were deciding on paying to start a new game, the waitress comes over and asks if she could close our tab out...? I felt as if we didn't have a choice to stay open so we confusingly said okay. When she brought the bill out to us, I paid in cash and she owed me change but never came back to give me the remainder..? Didn't even bother to ask, \"do you need cash back?\" Or anything. Just kept the change. After still trying to keep my hopes up for this place I just couldn't. Oh, and $13 for a shot of Jameson? I've never heard of that until tonight. I understand that it was a Monday night, but no matter what, service should always be up to par no matter how slow or how busy the establishment is. As a waitress myself, this whole experience had me in shock. Managers should focus on keeping their waitresses on 10 instead of playing pool and drinking iced tea all night long. Service makes people return or not."}
{"text":"Decent way to pass some time with family. In cityscape across from us airways stadium. Not much else to do there during the middle of the day though, also shoe rental is expensive so bring your own if you have them."}
{"text":"Was here on Apr 28 2013. Did not bowl, but wanted to play pool. Unfortunately, they only have 3 pool tables and they were taken. 

Ordered some late night snacks, which are not for the dieting kind. The food was really good thought. We ordered Belgian fries with choices of 2 dipping sauces and grilled chicken breast jerk skewers. The chicken was delicious and really moist. The fries were great and did not have the horrible smell of over-fried oil. The dipping sauces tasted wonderful and really complimented the fries. My sincere compliments to the chef.

And now the reasons why I'm giving only 3 stars. The table, which you choose on your own, was dirty and oily, as well as the sits. I had to wipe out pieces of some oily food from the sit. Our waitress did not smile even once, when you know you're supposed to leave a tip, you want to see a friendly face, especially if I myself am showing you one. The staff in general were really careless, chatting among themselves loudly and not paying enough attention to the customers. At some point there was some commotion, running around, very unprofessional. The washrooms were SOOO LOUD, they streamed the sound from the main sport's event into the washrooms, which is ok, BUT DO NOT MAKE IT SO LOUD. In my short visit to the washroom I was left with a headache and ringing in my ears, very irritating and not too mention damaging to the ears.

Would come back because of the food, but reactant due to wait staff."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I asked the bartender for a drink 4 times even waiving the money in his face and finally he said don't you see all these other people? Uh yes I do, I also saw people that got there after me getting served 1st. Whatever we ordered short rib nachos for$20  and it had a minuscule amount of meat. Soooooo disappointing and left me wishing I had gone elsewhere.  Definitely never going there AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In addition we had bottle service and the server never was around I mean it was VIP and we ended up serving ourselves and I found the server eating at the bar way to go!!! Worst experience ever."}

{"text":"The happy hour is awesome! We did bowling for four people and three jumbo sized appetizers that were super filling and delicious and we had a grand time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like going here for their \"lunch and bowl\" deal.  Its about $10  for lunch, a drink and a game.  The food is decent, although the service has been a bit iffy.  Usually you can be in and out within an hour...which is perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Working with Justine is awesome!  She has worked to get my group out to this amazing Phoenix venue.  Love the Gypsy bar, the pool tables, and epic bowling!  This is not your everyday smokey, league oriented bowling alley, this is a hip hang out with a downtown feel!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lucky Strike a few times and have loved it. I usually sit in the bar or lounge area with great service. However based on my last time there, I will probably not go back. I was there for lunch, and our server was great and telling us she was about to relocate. We wished her luck and told her that she would be hard to replace. Then out of no where this guy was behind the bar(i'm guessing a manager), said \"no she's not hard to replace\". Are you kidding me!!!!!! This is how management treats their staff? After I ate, I asked the server if I could see the manager. She told me she would be right back to go look for him. About 10 min later, she came back and told me the manager didn't have time to speak with me. This is absolutely crazy!!!!!! I definitely won't be back, and will tell my friends not to go there, even though the service and food is good. There are plenty of places  in downtown to support where the management treats their staff properly."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly awesome place to bowl and just relax with a VIP table. Great for parties and birthdays... Easy to get to parking was ample. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was taken here by my brother and cousin.  the place was covered with low class perverts, which ended up calling on a fight with my family and security did nothing!!! they even approached us after the incident and full out admitted they were watching the whole thing.  Does that make you feel safe? what is the sense off having security when they apparently are only there to watch fights.  i will never go there again nor do i recommend this place, worst experience ever.  to be honest i didn't even want to give them a one star"}
{"text":"A different way to have fun with your friends aside from the bar and club scene. There is an arcade, and it is attached to a bar so you have a lot of options."}
{"text":"My Family and I just got back from a few days in Downtown Phoenix.  Luck Strike was the HIGHLIGHT of our trip.  My 2 boys had such a blast.

The Manager, Nicole Joe, really went above and beyond, making our visit the best bowing, food and drinks experience we had ever experienced.  The drinks and food were all super good, and the lanes were so classy.

The look of this place is out of this world.  Huge flat screens above the pins, super classy lighting and wood everywhere.  Just being in this place makes you feel great.

I just wish this place was in Tucson, because we cannot wait to return.  Thank you Nicole Joe!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, great when you have a mixed crowd. Drinks are priced well. Food is great for a bowling alley. The fries with chimichurri sauce are my fave."}
{"text":"Excellent and prompt service.  Cool place.  It's a bar, glow in the dark bowling, and the waitresses are cool too."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks, mediocre food, and overpriced lane charges force Lucky Strike Lanes to fight for my approval right out of the gates.  The concept is dead on, but you'll definitely end the evening of fun with a lighter wallet to go along with your sore arm.  The music and layout was certainly the highlight and I had a blast hanging out with all my friends.  Bottomline - if you want to bowl, drink, and eat and it has to happen at the same venue, Lucky Strike is your place."}
{"text":"I organized a company event here a few weeks ago with a blind eye, since I had never been here before. The folks I worked with to set it up were great, and they definitely treated us well. It was a Wednesday night, so there wasn't much traffic downtown. We had a private area, which was clean and looked great. It was a little confusing that you have to go up to the counter to get your names put up on the screen to bowl, but once we figured it out, we were ready to go. The food they brought out was tasty, the drinks kept coming, and everyone had a great time. I'd definitely come here again for a date night or with a smaller group of friends."}
{"text":"I brought a group of friends here after a day of partying at various bars along the light rail to celebrate my birthday. At the front desk we met Leslie, who was one of the most friendly, generous, and accommodating person I've ever met. She made us all feel special, and our fun day had the perfect ending. We will be coming back here for sure. Kudos to Leslie and all the staff at Lucky Strike! Thanks for helping make my birthday special."}
{"text":"Loved lucky strick! Great bartenders, drinks, and the Brie cheese and apple quesadilla was the best I have ever had! Definitely go!"}
{"text":"This bowling alley forces you to wear long pants even though it's 100 degrees outside at night and if you wear shorts you get thrown out! This place is an absolute joke! Garbage! What am I supposed to do go pass out in a bowling alley because you force me to wear jeans"}
{"text":"Unlike Biggy Smalls, this place went from classy to ashy. Used to be decent, classy, fun; however, menu keeps changing, and the other night the management was awful and the lanes broke down. Manager told a friend, \"go back to LA with those earings\" after requesting compensation for broken lanes. I think he was trying to be funny, but swingggggg and miss. The food is pricy and worst of all the beer was warm, real warm. This was a great combination for some magnesium citrate and the toilet - both real and metaphorically."}
{"text":"I was able to attend a Yelp event at this place and from the start of walking in I thought wow.  This place has the right setup!  No complaints from the staff while I was at the Yelp event.  I called Friday afternoon to reserve a lane for Saturday night and the woman I spoke to was very helpful.  Showed up 10 minutes early and we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our lane to free up.  Not a big deal, we spent some time at the arcade and the bar.  The bowling is always fun and the music was on point.  This is a great place for a date or with a group of friends.  I recommend you call a week early to reserve your lane.  Weekends can get pretty busy, but you'll have a great time while you're there."}
{"text":"I am giving 1 star for the way they handle phone calls and reservations.  I have not been there and I'm not sure I want to.  I have a voucher for a Lucky party which I paid for at a charity auction that was donated by Lucky Strike.  When I tried to make a reservation to use my voucher I was ignored by the person I was emailing, then when I tried calling I was transferred to 4 different people before finally being told I can't make a reservation until the Monday before the date I need to reserve.  So they tell me there is availability now but I can't reserve it until 3 days before since I'm using a voucher.  Really?? Crappy way to treat people in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and we reserved a lane ahead of time for 150 dollars. We arrived and everything was fine and the food was good, drinks were good. After 30 minutes, our lane stopped working. They adjusted the time and fixed it for us. As the night went on, our lane stopped working two more times and we waited 30 minutes in between each maintenance check. Our party was supposed to end at 10. We were almost there until 11 with other plans lined up. We definitely did not get what we paid for as far as time goes. It was fine and we still had fun. I was fine with the birthday celebration and the service until we came back later that night to go to Gyspy bar. We actually had a lucky strike employee come up to us while we were celebrating  and asked us to come to the front, assuming we never paid for our lane. He questioned us and asked to see our receipt. We paid in advance and happily went to the front. We had to show the proof of payment on our phone. This was surprising considering we brought so much business to the lanes that night for my birthday and had paid ahead of time. Once it was confirmed we had paid, we didn't receive a sincere apology or explanation. Probably won't have a party here again which is a shame because I love lucky strike and love to bowl."}
{"text":"The food is quite novel, the drinks on happy hour is amazing. We had a gorgeous server with this thing people call a personality. She was friendly and intellectual! And she gave us happy hour discounts after it ran over (ooops!) Nice service, good music. I'd come and bowl except I don't bowl. So the bar food was that good. As far as drinks nothing too crazy just the staples on tap."}
{"text":"I've bowled here twice and have really enjoyed the experience.  Lucky Strike has definitely take an old kind of grungy tradition and given it new life.  As many have mentioned, the environment is very much a lounge feel.  It's fun and feels much cooler than any other lanes I've visited.  I've seen others mention the on screen sports and I would definitely add my vote to playing music videos, or something akin to that, instead.  It's not a sports bar, right?

They do have a great selection of happy hour snacks and sips.  I don't generally try to go out exclusively in the evening, so if you don't mind going out earlier for happy hour, it's definitely worth it.  Lots of tasty snacks and cheap drinks.  The fried macaroni bites were quite good, as is the flat bread pizza.

Now, when we went, as it was early, I guess there were kids around, and they wouldn't post our \"creative\" bowling names (Sticky Rice Ballz, Fire Crotch, etc.).  So, for better or worse, it's a family conscious environment.  Service on the whole was pretty good, though it seemed our waitress was sometimes absentee, and they weren't very busy.  Overall, I'd go back with friends."}
{"text":"I'll definitely be returning.  The initial cost to bowl was a bit pricey, but the drinks were very reasonable. I like that it has the gypsy bar right in it and an arcade as well. Cool place and nice service."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first since our previous visit over a year ago was not good but, this time around my kids and I had a great time! Jasmine was our waitress and made us feel like we had the VIP experience here. The arcade area was a little smaller than we expected but, the kids were all over it and enjoyed every second! We're definitely going to head back again and I'm recommending this place to all my friends to visit as well."}
{"text":"Fun!! There are only a handful of lanes, so we're happy that we thought ahead to make a reservation. We got in early, so we hung out at the bar with the awesome bartender. The lanes actually opened up a half hour early, so we were able to get started on our 2 hour bowling slot before we had a chance to challenge each other at Pacman. Two hours is the max amount of time you can play, which was perfect for our party of four, since we squeezed in three whole games with five minutes to spare in that time frame. It was hard to get a hold of our waitress while playing, so a couple times we went to the bar (conveniently located halfway between our lane and the bathroom) to grab a drink. The place is big and funky, and I can't speak for the food manu, but it did look like they had a nice variety of food. Definitely better than your average bowling alley!!!"}
{"text":"If you're a native, this is an entirely different bowling experience.  This place is awesome... the food was great, the service was friendly the place looks really cool.... I'm coming back soon."}
{"text":"Went there for a group event and I have to say, they did a great job of making us feel special. Food was very good and plentiful. Bowling was fun. Other items in the event room like wii tennis and board games were a plus(not sure if it was our guys or them). The hostesses were all very pleasant and helpful and wanting to aid in our enjoyment. I had a jolly fun time!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang, bowl, and drink.... visited on a Wednesday night and we were the only ones in the building but the staff is great and the drinks were good so we felt like VIPs!"}
{"text":"It's actually pretty decent but it's not cheap. I am not a bowler (and I don't intend to be one for the next few weeks at least)! I don't know if my feet can handle shoes that have been worn by many people - for hours! 

Germophobic (is that a term?) comment aside, this is a pretty neat place. My niece celebrated her birthday party and we all had fun! It's like disco fun. It's a cool retro bowling alley! 

Drinks start around $ 10. Food is around $ 15 (and up) depending on what you order. Sandwiches can be a bit dry so stick to your buffalo wings. Remember not to bowl and eat - it's dangerous, gross and unhealthy.

An hour of bowling is $45 while $15 for an hour of billiards. 

The servers were attentive (potentially because we tipped well) and the place isn't crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Tip: stay away from large group of tweens... your ear drums will thank you!


So there you go folks. If you're a bowler, this is a place to be!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have good, drinks, games and great music as well as bowling all wrapped up in one plus more. Mad I didn't discover this place until last night. Great spot for a night out on the town, date night etc... did I mention how good the drinks were?"}
{"text":"We had our staff holiday party here and I would say the service was just okay. Food wasn't great and most of it was spicy (yuck), waitresses were MIA, bowling ball weights were limited, one of our lanes kept glitching. Really, just too many things to get into, but they left a LOT to be desired! Personally, I don't think I would go back :/"}
{"text":"I checked out Lucky Strike while attending a birthday celebration. First off, it's really a nice looking place, decorated perfectly for my friend's bday. The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful in every way and the food was WAY BETTER than any other I've had at any bowling alley's I've ever visited. Many people in our party commented on that fact alone. Overall we had a great time! I'd definitely come back and also want to say after speaking to the staff and getting more info the place sure offers a lot. An excellent place to host a party of any sort or special event. They also have free dancing lessons on Tuesday nights! Sounds like fun."}
{"text":"DON'T GO IF YOUR ID WAS ISSUED IN THE MID 2000's OR EARLIER!!!!!!!!!!!
If I could've given zero stars I would've! My friends couldn't even make it past the doorman.  It was my friends 32nd birthday and because her id and another friends' id was issued in the early 2000's it didn't have some sort of Arizona state outline on it when a light is shined through it. Because of that we weren't allowed in because it could've been a fake. Really?!?! They're in her thirties, it was ridiculous! And we were there the weekend before and got in just fine! There were police officers by the door we talked to about the id's, they said they looked real and were just old but it was up to the doorman if we could get in. The jerk still wouldn't let us in so I asked to talk to a manager. While he was getting the manager we saw another doorman not flash his light on id's and let some little girls in. When the manager came out he looked more like the new bartender, he offered us free drinks when we get new id's and come back. Like we'd ever come back to place that wouldn't let us in, it would be one thing if we looked 12 but we're all pushing 30! It was really a shame, not only did they lose our business but also the 20+ party we had meeting us there. The other bars and restaurants appreciated our  $1000 tab.  Needless to say none of us will ever be going back!!! And its all because the doorman was such an asshole!!!!!"}
{"text":"When the announcement was made in early 2010 that Lucky Strike was coming to the neighborhood, I knew it would be special, and I knew it would be something that changed the game in Downtown Phoenix. Opening night at Lucky Strike went swimmingly, and it has been getting better and better ever since. 

The atmosphere is reminiscent of Big Lebowski, which coincidentally was the model bowling alley for the first Lucky Strike. It's a small bowling alley with only 12 lanes, a lounge and bar area, and pool tables. Make no mistake, it isn't cramped, just a small place with a lot going on. By day you'll enjoy well lit lanes and a bright casual atmosphere, but by night, that all changes drastically. Lucky Strike is predominately a night club on the weekends, when the music is loud, the lights are low, and the sexy people are aplenty, sometimes three deep standing at the bar with a 2 hour wait for a lane. Some say the Old Town crowd has moved in, but I say it's a diverse and fun mix of people all with the same intention of dancing to old school hip hop, bowling, and having some fun downtown. The bowling lanes are a little nicer than your standard bowling alley. They have newer and better scoring machines, TVs behind the pins, and all state of the art technology. It's really fantastic.

Throughout dozens of visits, once as many as three times in a 24 hour period, I've recieved both exceptional service and awful service, with no real consistency either way. One visit, we sat down at the bar by the window in the back of the club, and were told we could not order drinks there. Another visit, I waited 15 minutes to get my tab after requesting it, though we were the only ones there. Other visits, the service was so perfect that we felt we could may as well be guests in someone's home. The staff here is all friendly, and everyone seems to like their job. I have a theory on the service, and that is the way the managerial staff has the place set up. It doesn't flow well for the servers. Example, there is a bar right by the bowling lanes which is never open. The other bar is around the corner, down the stairs, in another room. Servers must go here to refill a drink or get a beer, which makes it take forever. They should really work on a way to make food and drink service more expeditious. 

By this point, I've tried every item on Lucky Strike's $5.50 lunch special (lunch, soda, shoes, and one game) menu and they have all been good. Some of the standouts for me are the Turkey Brie sandwich, a mixture of sliced turkey, melted brie, and apple butter on a Ciabatta, the Bleu Mini Burger, served in a duo (you can mix and match with other types as well) with house made french fries. You really can't go wrong with any of it, though. The happy hour menu features half priced \"Lounge Menu,\" $2 domestic drafts, and I forget what else from 4- and 9-close 7 nights a week. I love the pretzel dippers, served with garlic butter, mustard, and cheese dip, as well as the Beef Skewers with a spicy and sweet glaze. The same mini burgers are available at happy hour as well. 

In actuality, if you're a hardcore bowler, you might not care about all the flash and bang at Lucky Strike. You might not care that there are beautiful women serving you food and drinks right at your lane while wearing little black mini skirts. You might not notice the DJ booth in the lounge area, and you surely might ignore the animations on the screen when you get a strike, but for those of us who can't seem to muster more than 125 a game, and really just want to hang out in a cool place with great food and friendly people, Lucky Strike is heaven."}
{"text":"The lighting. It's the lighting.

Whomever did the lighting design for Lucky Strike deserves an award. The lighting makes the place, even more than the furniture and colors. You walk into this subdued nightclub-seeming space, totally devoid (it seems) of any florescent tubes. Instantly your expectations are thrown off. Wasn't this supposed to be a bowling alley? It looks more like a martini bar or gallery or something. . . 

And truth be told it probably works better as a martini bar and gallery than as a bowling alley.

As a bowling alley it's small in most dimensions. There are -- I believe-- 8 lanes. The approach area for each lane is adjacent to the ball-returns, which is a bit off-putting for those used to more ample spaces. And as bowling goes (at $4 per game) it's a bit expensive. The furniture is soft and comfy--in addition to being retro-chic modern--but with 8 people playing per lane there really isn't enough of it. 

We were told by the staff that first of all, we would need to bowl in teams of 8 per lane. That's understandable, and didn't pose much of a difficulty among our group of 16. However, the payment for the games could only be split into a maximum of two transactions. That meant that we needed to pay two people with cash who then bought our bowling fun in a sort of straw sale.  Inconvenient, especially considering that 4 or 5 people suddenly needed to run to an ATM and probably pay a 3-dollar fee. Is there another way to handle it? Probably.

Then there are the laughable intellectual property regulations. We were told we couldn't take pictures of each other inside because everything inside is copyrighted. Well . . . y'know. . . . in this day of cell-phone cameras and fast CCD's that don't need flashes . . . well . . . I'VE GOT YOUR COPYRIGHT RIGHT HERE, PAL!!! Let me just say \"f*cking lawerly morons\" and leave it at that. 

I ordered a martini that really wasn't too bad. Nothing to write home about. I think it came in at $9. It really wasn't worth that. I noticed others enjoying sliders and pretzels that looked good.

So what you get at Lucky Strike is a sanitized bowling experience with new equipment in a very nicely lit space. It's probably better as a date experience than for larger groups. And I think ironic urban hipsters have probably found their new home in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had the short ribs...If you like short ribs this is a must try here??  Yes at a bowling alley the short ribs was delicious and the Parmesan Bread pudding was an unexpected treat.  I finished this plate and for a fair price of $15!  
Not an avid bowler so I sat it out with my group and just had beer and food.  Great place for a large crowd to mingle or in our case a birthday party.  Great music, video screens, and watching drunk people bowl is great entertainment :)"}
{"text":"Very cool place downtown in CityScape, love the idea, not your dad's bowling alley full of sweaty old men playing in league's. This is definitely built more around the lounge concept than bowling lanes. A great place to have a b-day party with friends, they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went. They stocked local brew from Four Peaks which is awesome.

The downside is the service wasn't the best but this is a new location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will figure it out. Other than that we highly recommend checking it out, once CityScape is done it's gonna be great to hangout downtown."}
{"text":"I planned a corporate outing at Lucky Strike during my company's annual sales conference. Our group had about 20 people and a fairly strict budget to follow. I initially sent an inquiry the week before via the group sales form on the website. Within about 1 business day I received a follow up from their sales manager, Justine to begin the planning process. 

Justine made it easy for me to get our event planned! We traded a lot of emails about the details and it went off without a hitch. The easiest part was adding a few last-second additions, and she quickly sent over a revised contract/link for payment. We went with unlimited bowling for 2 hours + a few heavy appetizers (~$35/person). 

Our group had a few allergies to accommodate, Justine & her team even went as far as asking if our seafood allergy could eat the buffalo wings fried in the same oil as something seafood. I checked & it wasn't a worry, but they went ahead and cleaned the fryer and made food special for that and others in addition to what we ordered. I know everyone appreciated that. 

It was a little chaotic since my coworkers staggered in arrivals for about 15 minutes. Our waitress though tried to help me out (organized chaos with al the info), but once the games got started it was all good. Drinks were re/filled consistently, people were able to move about easily to bowl and chat- they gave us the VIP section with the uber comfy couches. The longer the event wore on, the warmer it got inside- not sure if Lucky Strike has actual air conditioning or a swamp cooler. Nonetheless it was uncomfortably warm and kind of a sour note to end on since most of our group was sweaty-ish by the end.

Despite that minor fallback, my coworkers had a wonderful time, I kept receiving compliments for a week after for the event, and my mad bowling skills. Thank you Justine & team for a great time!"}
{"text":"This place Lucky Strike is awesome! For bowling, drinking or eating! But the bowling is a plus!! The ambience and colors inside are fabulous so you feel more like you are walking into a club than a bowling alley, but very cool.Overall, Lucky Strike is a great addition to downtown.  A cool bar that has bowling, not a dirty, smoky, bowling alley.  Go for dinner,or happy hour,just go for nighttime fun on the weekend.  Either way, I think you'll have a good time. If any you ladies on Yelp like to bowl , look me up.."}
{"text":"Pretty good service.  Bowling could've been better as far as lane condition and ball selection.  But had a great time overall."}
{"text":"I really like this place. There aren't that many lanes, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, call ahead and reserve your lane. 
This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time. 
My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me. 
I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained."}
{"text":"I was very excited to check this place out but was unfortunately really disappointed in the experience. I went with friends this past weekend and while I expected it to be busy, I had no idea it would be as packed as it was. 

We went on the wait list at 7:30 for a lane and were told it should be an hour and a half, we were happy with that and went to get some food and drinks. Our waitress took 6 orders without writing anything down, when we said \"wow that is amazing you can remember all that\" she quickly told us how wonderful her memory is...we were all impressed....until we got our orders. Of the 6, 3 were messed up and when we nicely asked for things to be fixed she rolled her eyes and was very nasty. 

I worked in food service for years and believe that even if you are annoyed, you should never let the customer know that and NEVER roll your eyes in front of them. So after we got all that squared away and were 2 hours into our wait for a lane, we were told it would be at least another hour to bowl....lesson learned. We will not be back to Lucky Strike. The atmosphere was really cool but the service was so poor that it is not worth making the trip there for mediocre food and service with an attitude."}
{"text":"Fun place, more than just bowling. There are a few pool tables, a game room and a dance floor and of course a bar. Had great music and great service."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and entertainment here at Lucky Strike. Joined some friends for a bowling game and I was very impressed by their food and beverage service and prompt service. The staff was super friendly and courteous and delivered food to our table at lightning speed. I highly recommend the wings and the cheese curds. Overall a great place with a great vibe in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a sexy place to go bowling. Fam frm the bay are visiting thought we would take em here, glad we did! They had a great time, service was great and the music was not bad and wasn't too loud... Food was good and so were the drinks but a little on the expensive side but what do I expect from a nice place like this. Totally worth it! And got to even dance to a few songs! :) will definitely be back, maybe next time for date night!"}
{"text":"Lucky Strike was a great hang! We brought the kids and the grand kids, we bowled two games and had a great lunch while playing. We even played a little pool on the billiards table. The staff was friendly, welcoming and served us well. 
We will be back for more fun."}
{"text":"Just had a party here at Lucky Strike and did a pre-pay package. It was awesome. Great atmosphere, fun music, the lanes in bowling were awesome and the service was the cherry on top. They were very nice and were right on it with bringing drinks! New favorite bowling alley/bar!!"}
{"text":"People were awesome
The drinks are decent enough
The balks are too standardized
The food is meh"}
{"text":"Nice bowling place downtown. Four or five lanes, and they do have a bar and food but I have not had any. They used to have a fairly large arcade area but it is actually now only about half the size. Bowling games and shoes are both $4 each. But they do have lunch and bowl deals where you buy a lunch and get shoes and bowling free..."}
{"text":"The Lucky Strike has been our go-to to kick off nights downtown. The atmosphere and crowd are very fun. The bartenders were very friendly when I asked about a new drink recommendation and the waitresses were very prompt and kept a good eye on my party. The DJ was great as many of us noted were noting through the night the good mix of music being played. I have yet to have had any complaints about my time here!"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent from getting our lane and shoes to our food server. We forgot our parking ticket to validate, our server was nice enough to bring us the sticker we needed. The Mac n cheese bites we're delicious along with the margarita pizza. The food was brought out in a timely manner. Our server also kept our water topped off.
The bad news is the lanes are dark. If your competitive don't plan on using the arrows. When we started bowling the overhead lights were on but half way through the first game they dimmed the lights.
The lanes had glitches and would either give extra points, take away points, or not reset. The lane next to us bowled five times before it reset, even after hitting the reset button and the spare point weren't awarded.
Due to the outside sign not being lit we had a hard time finding to location. We found it by looking at the Yelp pictures. We like the location being near Chase field."}
{"text":"Awesome place to wind down after work! Love the bartenders!!! They get ya goin after a long day!
We don't bowl much but love to watch people try! I am planning on coming back just as often as I already do!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this review really isn't fair. I got to come here for an elite event and from that event I got a coupon for free bowling... I did buy drinks though! Anyway, Lucky Strike is a chain of bowling alley/ bars. This one, like others I have been to, is clean and has a 'fun' atmosphere. We came in the afternoon and got to bowl for an hour, which was great! We had some chips and salsa, which was tasty, and mac and cheese bites, which were not as good as they sound, but alright. You're not here to eat, right? They have a decent happy hour with discounted food and drinks. We had a couple beers which were fairly priced under 5$. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Today I had the club sandwich for lunch and it was without a doubt one of the top five sandwiches of my lifetime. A club sandwich seems easy enough to master but Lucky Strike threw an egg on top and change the game. Mind = Blown. Also, I had been a little underwhelmed by the service in visits past but today everything went nice and smooth. Your stock is rising, Lucky Strike!"}
{"text":"Pretty awkward lunch.  I went with work friends thinking it would be cool to catch their lunch special. But we end up being sat around lounge chairs in the bar area where you have to lean over a low table to eat your lunch. it was overpriced, mediocre food. not returning unless it's for a happy hour or actually bowling"}
{"text":"My first experience here was short, sweet, and to the point. It was pleasurable. In other words, I had been eagerly anticipating a return.

My second experience was cause enough to never return. 

Picture this- there were perhaps 10-20 patrons in attendance, and mind you, 'twas about 1:15AM when we arrived. We had no intent to bowl as they have a spectacular looking bar that actually showcases local artists' works (I'd give them more than two thumbs up if I physically could for this) so the idea was to grab a few cocktails. Service was lackadaisical at best even though we were the only ones at the bar itself.

The epic fail that we ran headfirst into was the extreme absence of management, poor salesmanship on behalf of the bartenders, and the uber extremism of the  \"bouncers.\" Unfortunately whenever there are a bunch of guys behind me yelling at me to \"get out\" after the bartender has just delivered a drink, I am going to be a bit frustrated. By the way, it was still before 2:00AM.

Ultimately it's a shame. As I was walking out I told one of the \"bouncers\" that I would never be back, to which he replied, \"It's no skin off my back.\" For a service-based business in downtown Phoenix to have such a blatant disregard for any patronage they may acquire is simply dumbfounding. I live a few blocks away and whole-heartedly wanted this place to be a \"go to\" spot for when friends and family from other parts of the valley and from out of state visit, but if the \"bouncers\" are the only voice here then I would prefer to give my business to anywhere besides Lucky Strike."}
{"text":"We had an office party here Friday for our one-year anniversary.  So, being that I didn't have to pay for the games, shoes, or food, my review is based on my experience.  Just thought I'd get that out there so nobody reams me.  
We got the private room, which was really nice.  In fact, everything here was really nice: the decor, the people and, being that it's a new bowling alley, the shoes.  The shoes were still brand-new.  That's huge.
We had a TON of food!  Pot stickers, pizza, veggie trays.  Everything was great and tasted fresh.  It wasn't Sysco food.
The service was outstanding!  I'm not one of those people who says \"outstanding\" very often, but we were really taken care of well.
There's a nice lounge off the main room for people who just want to...go to the bowling alley to drink.  Do people really do that???  
I can't wait to get a group together to go again.  It's fun, it's Downtown and I'm excited about CityScape!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were so excited to come here a few weeks ago since we have had fun in the past. Unfortunately, this time it was a bit of a letdown. We got there at 6:30pm and for an hour, it was $50 or $60...so expensive! Not bad if there are a number of you but there was only two of us and that time, you HAVE to purchase an hour. Okay, fine, not a big deal. We sit down and our lane didn't work as the hour is ticking down. You would think there is something that automatically notifies the employees that the lane has malfunctioned but I guess not. I notified the girl and they moved us to lane 11 which is second from the last lane. I know things happen, so that didn't really bother me. As we are bowling though, we were so hot and sweating! I was practically parked by the fan on the equipment that cools your hands. I started getting nauseous because I was so warm. When I mentioned this to our server (because I was concerned the AC was broken on that end of the floor), she agreed it was hot but that always happens when they raise the shades on the windows. She said the windows get so hot that even when the sun sets, it keeps that side really warm. I asked her to notify the manager because the heat had made us really uncomfortable. She said she would but we never got a visit or apology from the manager. Frustrating. If you know that is an issue then turn up the issue in that particular zone. I do not expect to pay that much for an hour of bowling to sweat my ass off the whole time. That is ridiculous. 

On a positive note, the service was good and they had a great happy hour during the time we there. For two apps and a beer, our bill was approx $10. I felt like that really balanced out the price of bowling during happy hour. 

Will I go back? Likely. But it is a shame that I'll have to picky about what lane we go to which might limit our ability to even get a lane. We'll see..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! For bowling, drinking or eating! But the bowling is a plus!! The ambience and colors inside are fabulous so you feel more like you are walking into a club than a bowling alley, but very cool. The menu is WAY better than it has to be. You should not expect traditional pizza and fries at this place. The bar tender Teddy makes great drinks and Buddy, well I don't really know what Buddy does, but he's very friendly! This is a great place for a date, a double date, a party or even for happy hour. The hosts are not overly friendly but that isn't that surprising. Overall fun and beautiful! Good times!"}
{"text":"Our company recently had a corporate event at Lucky Strike and we had a blast!  The team there (Mick, Nicole, Rudy & Dallas) really made an effort to make sure we were comfortable and had no worries.  The whole experience gave a lasting impression to everyone that came.  Thanks Lucky Strike Team!"}
{"text":"Planned a bowling night for 8 of my friends.  Called a couple days before to check to see if I needed to reserve a lane.  I was told reservations are only for groups who purchase a food & beverage package and that I should get there about 7:15/7:30 and put my name on the list for 8PM bowling time.  Arrived at 7:20 and was told no lanes would be available till 9:30/10.  Texted my friends to come around 9.  Ordered an ice tea at the bar (DD for the night) and was told there was a $10 minimum.  My bowling pager went off just after 8PM.  There was a cancellation and my lane was ready.  Unfortunately, only 2 of my friends were there.  We were informed that it's $50 per lane per hour and you have to decide right then how many hours you want to bowl and you must prepay.  They can only split the bill 2 ways (so make sure you/r friends bring cash).  The three of us ended up bowling for 1 hour and with shoe rental, it ended up $68.  Needless to say my other friends didn't make it in time to join us and they didn't end up getting a lane until after 10.

Bottom line, Lucky Strike is pretty cool, but definitely overpriced and chaotic if your group isn't all there and ready to wait for your lane.  It could be really fun if your group is willing to dole out the dough and get a food & bev package so you can actually make a reservation and bowl when you want to.  It seems a bit out of place, being Downtown.  Lucky Strike would rock in Old Town.  I will not be back, on my own dime at least."}
{"text":"My brother bragged non stop about how we had to make the drive from east mesa to downtown phoenix to hang out at this amazing place. Well, after meeting some friends for drinks at a downtown bar we made our way to Lucky Strike to play some pool and continue our drinking. As we walked in I was actually pretty surprised it was pretty damn cool. It was a adult playground, I felt like this is someplace my wife could drop me off for a playdate with buddies. We made our way to the pool hall desk and they told us it would be about a 30 min wait (this was around 930). We gave them our ID and phone number and headed to the \"club\" area to have drinks while we waited. For a Friday night it was pretty dead, but This bartender serving drinks was running around like he was super slammed when there was only like 10 people on his side of the bar and 3/4 of them had drinks. Even with that the other 1/4 of us he was ignoring. I later learned his priority was to get the waitresses taken care of before he even focused on us. After finally getting some drinks and settling in a booth in the corner we hung out. The music was good and the place was lively. After about a hour and a half we realized the pool people never called us like they said they would. We went back over there and they told us there was still a wait even though there was a couple open tables... I don't know the process but we threw in the towel on even trying to play pool. We went back to the music area and as I went up to get my tab from the bartender I again waited 15 min for him to serve the waitresses before even paying attention to us (not a very good multi-tasker). Earlier in the night I had accidently walked into the waitress station and the bartender had scolded my friend and I about  being in there. While we were waiting for our tab a girl and guy walked in there in front us a few of us and got their drinks directly from him. This was my last straw with this bartender and I made it known I was unhappy with his service and the fact he scolded us and then completely let a couple of people get drinks from the area we got chewed out. This was one of the first time in a long time I did not leave  a single dollar tip since after I expressed my frustrations he shrugged and literally danced off. IM not a cheap person, however I wont tip horrendous service when they even make it a point that they really didn't care about taking care of you. If your traveling far to hit this spot up its def worth checking it out for a couple hrs. There will be no next time for me. ill go to my local bar, the shiny lights and rude employees aren't worth that drive to me."}
{"text":"I love this spot. I must admit I hate bowling- okay maybe not hate, but it's definitely not a first go-to activity. This place though....I love the lighting, the friendly staff, the great music, THE FOOD! I would reserve a lane in advance -just in case. I love how they have a dress code (nothing fancy but no *AHEM* trashy allowed). If someone says bowling this is where I go! They also have pool tables and bar area. SO great for more than one party type."}
{"text":"Wow. I came here with my charity running group and the whole place was able to accommodate almost 500 ppl. The bar was able to keep up despite the huge influx of people. The music was perfect for getting people out on the dance floor. I played some skeet ball and only wish I had more time to play some bowling. If I am ever in Phoenix again, I imagine this would make for a great date night."}
{"text":"(2.5/5 stars)

Since it was my sister's 21st birthday we all drove from Mississauga to Vaughan just to make her happy. I've been to Lucky strike on two separate occasions but never had to pay because it was either for a work party or a Yelp event. 

As soon as we entered we noticed the girl sitting at the front desk was on her phone. She didn't seem like she wanted to be there and didn't even greet us. The other girl working by the cash register and bowling shoes was eating during her shift. These two girls were not professional at all. 

There were 6 of us who bowled so we opted for the 1 hour rate of $65 on top of $3.95 shoe rentals. The hourly rate only got us 1 complete game and 1.5 completed round for the second game. We determined that it wasn't worth it to pay for the hourly rate because it was more than paying for single games. So if you do decide to go I would suggest the single games. After bowling we decided to get a single game but the girls working at the cash register said we could only get the hourly rate since we got that the first time. She said she wasn't going to close and re-open the game which didn't make sense to us. It's not that hard. We could have simply left and came back and paid for a single game. After that we decided not to bowl anymore and get some shots for the birthday girl.

The four of them got a shot of patron and it was ridiculously expensive. The bill came out to $65 for 4 shots! 

This place is VERY overpriced and we should've just went bowling in Mississauga instead of commuting it all the way to Vaughan to be ripped off."}
{"text":"Lucky Strike strikes the wrong chord with me.  I've been here to this location four times.  I have been to another location out of state on a couple occasions, as well.

Since my first visit, the bartending staff has improved LEAGUES.  The women working at the bar last Friday night were actually personable and friendly.  That is saying something, as in the past the people working at the bar were... to put it nicely... AWFUL PEOPLE.  

It's a great CONCEPT, but it just doesn't impress me.  The food is hit or miss, but it is usually miss.  Some food that comes out of their kitchen is just awful.  They don't ever seem to have drink specials... at least when I've gone.  The bowling is pretty expensive compared to Brunswick Zone and... honestly... I prefer Brunswick.  

If it was up to me, I would avoid Lucky Strike altogether.  Sure, it has a nice downtown location.  Still, there are so many better places to spend my hard earned money downtown."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed until a friend introduced it to me... On the night of my \"birthday\" gathering!  
Wow!  Very cool place in Phoenix!  Who knew!  
We went fairly late after hitting Sens in Downtown PHX, so we didn't have a chance to bowl too much, but it was a place everyone enjoyed and said \"we need to do this again!\"  

They have a bar, which seemed decently priced, 7-8 dollars for Vodka/Redbull and 14 dollars for a bucket of Millers, I believed included 5 longnecks.  

Go check it out!"}
