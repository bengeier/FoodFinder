{"text":"So,

I walked in for a last minute happy hour celebration and was impressed by the decor. As soon as I walked in I could smell the deliciousness of the food luring me closer to the kitchen. The bartender chats me up, hands me their happy hour menu and begins to make me one of the most delectable and strong Cosmos outside of NYC. 

The meatballs and brushetta were out-of-this world. 

I must go back!!"}
{"text":"Long-time fans of the Mill Ave location...we finally made it out to the original (I think this was the original, anyways).  

Overall, pretty darn good.  

The food is on par with the tempe location.  The pastas were delicious - I really liked the Boa Bowtie pasta.   

Wines were solid and complimented the meal nicely.

As with the Tempe location, the best part for us is always the Shrimp Adriatica appetizer.  We could just eat a big bowl of that with bread.  The sauce is amazing, the shrimp is well cooked.  The only downside was that it was just regular french bread (or similar) - the tempe location has the fancier, tastier varieties of fresh baked bread.  But the quality of shrimp and sauce was the same.  

Service was slow at first (we went late on a Sat night as they were slowing down), but was friendly, made great recommendations and were very helpful overall.  By the end of the meal, I had forgotten about the slow start.  Think we just walked in at an awkward time, which as I said, they really made up for by the end of the meal.  

Also, the warm butter cake was decadent.  Maybe not as good as Mastro's butter cake, but it's on the way there.  Really tasty, very fresh.  I could have used some fresh whipped cream or a little vanilla ice cream to go with it, but that's a personal thing.  

On a side note - the Zinfandel they are currently offering (think it was like $6-7/glass) is fantastic.  I was impressed at the quality compared to the price.  

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Friendly staff! They had a large party in there and the people at the party were very abusive and the manager handled it with class. The staff remained calm and got the food out smiling the whole time . A+"}
{"text":"We went to Caffe Boa last night for my Mother in Law's birthday.  It had been years since we were last there, and ever since we moved back to Phoenix I've been excited to go back.  We were, however, very disappointed.  The pasta was overcooked and was drowning in sauce.  My husband and MIL had the rigatoni puttanesca, and the sauce was very tomato-y and not very flavorful.  I had the penne in pesto sauce with chicken and hearts of palm.  The sauce, aside from there being way too much, was also very heavy and, well, gooey.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it wasn't a dish I would order again!  The fact that my dish was almost $16 made it feel like even more of a rip-off.

My feeling is that Caffe Boa is riding on their reputation from years ago when it was good...either that or it was a really off night.  We won't be going back - there are other great restaurants to explore.  We'll just hang on to the memories of Caffe Boa of the past."}
{"text":"Pasta had ZERO flavor. I was very disappointed. To be fair, the bruschetta was good."}
{"text":"The only thing keeping this 5 stars is the price point and service.  The service should be better and more attentive.  It took the staff did not welcome me, so I just walked to the bar and sat down.  Still it took a while to get service

The food is great, but about 20-30% overpriced."}
{"text":"love this place....

had a great first experience....

Jamie, is probably one of the nicest, most polite servers I've had. 

Everything came out quickly and super fresh. 

The soho is a great sandwich for lunch. plan on splitting it if you get appetizers or salad as well. 

Great ambiance. 

Saw the rave reviews about the butter cake, unfortunately it was still hot and not ready to serve, but Jamie more than made up for it and suggested the brownie and vanilla bean ice cream.

Enjoyed this place so much I made a reservation while there for Mother's Day. 

Plan on coming back soon one evening for butter cake to go  haha 

Anyways great place for a quick, gluten free, organic, and fresh lunch!"}
{"text":"Went to Caffe Boa for the 1st time with a group of girlfriends. It was a horrible experience. Drinks took between 10-20 minutes each time we ordered and the restaurant was not busy. Wine should not take that long to pour. My ice tea was never refilled. 

I ordered the filet special with sauce on the side - medium well.  When my entree came it was smothered in the sauce. I sent it back immediately and when my steak returned it was dry and cooked well done. 3rd time it came back correct but at that point- about 2 hours into the meal it's just not acceptable. I would have expected for something to be reduced on my bill but it was not. I would have expected the manager to possibly come and apologize- never happened. 

Needless to say I will never go back and will not recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine (or a bottle) on the patio.  I can't think of another place I would rather be in Ahwatukee on a nice night.  The atmosphere is so relaxing.  

The food is wonderful.  I highly recommend the specials of the day.  All of the fish is flown in daily and cooked to perfection!  The wine list is very extensive and fairly priced.  The butter cake dessert will change your life.  

If you are in the area, you must stop by!"}
{"text":"So yummy!!!! The pasta was great and the atmosphere was fantastic! I have a gluten allergy and they were so knowledgeable! Gluten free pasta and salad dressing! I can't wait to go back! Wish they had gluten free bread, but still 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time a few months ago per a recommendation & I wasn't very impressed. Staff was very nice & my boyfriend liked his meal but my meal was so-so (I had the gnocchi). This week I thought I would try it again...I ordered the pesto pasta for pick up & it was delicious. Glad I gave it a second chance."}
{"text":"I have been taking friends and relatives here for several years but no more. Sat night's visit went wrong in so many ways. We agreed to wait 30 min for a patio table and told we could order drinks at a table indoors while we waited.  Our waitress was not informed of that. We ordered beers they had listed but the first tap beer we ordered they were out. The bottled beer we ordered they were out, all of which led to delayed service.  We had to nag to be seated outside even though we could see tables opening up and were told twice they were \"setting up\" for us which involved all of setting out rolled up napkins. Then we finally were seated but they put three of us at two small tables set next to each other which was so clumsy. A server tried to bring our water out to us even though one was empty and asked which of us was by the door so he could give us the right glass. I had to tell him to bring fresh waters. Finally we ordered dinner and a bottle of Cline Zinfandel --very common label. Nope, they were out. The bottle we took instead was great however and our food was very good and well-served. We did get an offer to move to a square table before our food arrived but we declined because it was next to a table at which three young women were all smoking!!  I suspected they were friends of a manager who came to visit them for a while. He should have been trying to manage the service instead. Our server was very nice and apologetic, and we tipped her accordingly, but she could not make up for the total lack of management in the restaurant that night. When we left, our water glasses all were empty and had been for some time. Very disappointing all around!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something a little more sophisticated than the Olive Garden (or O.G. as my best friend and I like to call it!), head out to Cafe Boa for the best Italian food Arizona has to offer. The cafe and wine bar has a variety of delcious pastas on the menu ( I love the Tortellini Brigantino). They also offer a variety of martinis (my favorite is the pomegranate martini). And their illuminated patio makes for a romantic setting for those date nights."}
{"text":"Very Nice Atmosphere, As Far As The Food The Only I Had So Far Was The Shrimp Bisque It Was Good Not Great But Good. But I Will Go Back To Try A Few Other Things"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Always a nice experience, and everyone is very friendly!  My husband and I enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"This place was so neat! The patio was lovely with nice lighting and a live musician, very relaxing! It would be a great place for a date with the dim lighting and the nice, long wine list. I went with a friend and and the food was wonderful. We had the shrimp bisque to start and my friend ordered a bowl so I could try some but the waitress surprised us and split the bowl in two so we each had our own, I thought that was thoughtful (: The voodoo penne was good and if you're a fan of lots of peppers and tomatoes then it would be  good choice. What I will say is that this place is pricey, it was over $30 a piece before tipping which I think is about double a lot of places prices for similar dishes. The presentation and preparation of the food was fabulous though, you can tell that they care about how the food looks! I would go back but not too often, it'd hurt the pocket book too much :P"}
{"text":"Now, I've been here once before in April and loved it. The food was great, The server was polite and knowledgeable, and they had someone playing live music on the beautiful patio. The reason for the 3 stars is tonight. My man and I have pretty hectic schedules and had been planning on coming back for some time. We rushed tonight to make it before 10pm when it closes. We got there at 9:30 and already all the chairs were turned over on the tables and it was closed. Pretty disappointed because I had been looking forward to dinner there again. The scallops in the pasta with a creamy sauce was amazing, Would have been nice to have it again. So, April experience was great, this one, non existent."}
{"text":"I live in the local community and love Boa.  First & foremost, Scott the owner is there most nights and creates an inviting and connected space for his patrons.  The knowledgeable staff  are good looking, friendly and always anticipating our needs. The outside patio is lovely with the ambient lights and live music.  The bar has been remodeled as of recent and the new chef is fabulous!  I highly recommend this restaurant for food, drinks, wine list and local residents."}
{"text":"Terrific first experience.  The restaurant was crowded but the hostess made an effort be accomodating despite us not have reservations.  While she was off scouting a table, several of the wait staff asked if we had been helped.  Started out with the pom cran martini and it was just the right combination of tart and sweet.  My husband had the mango one which I found a little too sweet--could have used a touch more tang.   The bruschetta was very tasty--lots of delicious marinated tomato and a few olives and field greens on the side as a bonus.  I loved the osso buco special--the savory meat was falling off the bone tender and the orzo/vegetables were delicious.   My husband had the filet mignon special on the purple mashed potatoes and it was also very good.  Our waiter was very attentive and somehow having water in a coke glass with lemon makes it all the more refreshing.   We enjoyed the guitarist/singer who played a combination of 70s folk rock and today's adult alternative.  Just two negatives: 1) the overall noise level of the restaurant--we found ourselves having to talk loud and/or repeat ourselves although we were tete a tete.  I imagine this is not an issue on a less crowded night.  2) The lighting was also inadequate--the meal was delicious but it was hard to see exactly what were eating."}
{"text":"Great food and very knowledgable/helpful staff. A little expensive, but the food is definitely worth it Have had pasta on one occasion and salmon on another....loved them both. Will definitely be back to support this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Cafe Boa has a delicious collection of dishes, some with strong or spicy flavors, others more finely tuned and nuanced.  I was struck by how extremely fresh their cheeses and other ingredients were. It is a perfect atmosphere for romantic dinners or lunches with friends  I always get the Shrimp Adriatica before my meal.

One odd note:  their menu recently removed the titles of items, which increases the difficulty in ordering somewhat.  I knew some of the names of things, as did our waiter, but when I ordered by reciting the description of my selection both he and I kind of rolled our eyes at the ridiculousness of the situation.

Also, if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night, and you elect to sit on the patio, know that at 9pm the nightclub upstairs and across the parking lot will begin to blast you with music.  It probably wouldn't be so bad except that the music Cafe Boa plays is quite noticeably good."}
{"text":"As good as the food and atmosphere are...the service is equally bad. The place is small and somewhat pricey although not terribly. We have been several times and have a decent meal. Nothing great. Servers with some care and hustle would make this place stand out. Sadly it falls very short of the potential."}
{"text":"First, let me just say you do not go to a place like Cafe Boa and expect everything to happen fast.  Good food does take time and this place does have some very, very good food.

I will agree with some reviewers that sometimes the service can be slow, but then again I have only been there when they have been packed full, so what do you expect.

My first visit I had the Voodoo Penne.  Wonderful dish, garlic cream sauce was, well, very creamy.  Chicken was cooked right, pasta was firm but not chewy.  My only complaint would be I expected a little more spiciness from the blackened chicken.

My next visit I had the Agnolotti Boa.  As a mushroom fan I was expecting a lot from this dish and it did not disappoint.  Very well put together ravioli and the tomato and seasoned cream sauce pulled it together nicely."}
{"text":"I took my family here on a Sunday night for a nice dinner out. Personally, I had the bolognese and found it satisfactory. We split a dinner size caesar salad among the three of us and it was still rather large.

We all had pastas. In my opinion, they were over-sauced. But, I'm the type of person who likes very little sauce on pasta.

Service was good as well. I recommend."}
{"text":"Exceptional entrees, especially the filet mignon.  Quite good service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is an example of how stupid yelp reviews are.  This food is good.  However the place has worst reviews than a casino chop house down the road.  Trust me, Boa is good, especially compared to the crap served down the road."}
{"text":"Best. Dessert. Ever. The butter cake is beyond good. Sometimes we go just for that!  The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I had gnocchi as an entree and it was very good. Tasted just like my great grandmas. The drinks are also very good, with unique flavor combinations. The patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this past Saurday, taking advantage of the nice weather by sitting on the patio.  I really enjoyed the experience!  The host and servers were very friendly and knowledgeable, and they took wonderful care of us.  We started with the crostini boa, which was an assortment of 4 crostini, each topped differently.  The difference between great tomatoes and no-so-great ones is huge .... these were delicious and bursting with great flavor.  Then I had the homemage beef lasagna .....excellent and enough to fill me up and take some home.  I am not a huge dessert eater, but my guest was and we opted for the butter cake (although we weren't sure what to expect.)  Upon first bite, we both looked at each other for an OMG moment.  It was warm, delicious, and very memorable.  We had a great time, and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The staff seemed to be fixated on each other, then attending to their customers. They were even on their phones texting out in the open. Be a little subtle please.

The food was alright. The Agnolotti Boa raviolis were overcooked; too chewy. 

I might give it another try the food again in the future, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Boa in Tempe, and often take new clients there or visit for a unique dish and great glass of wine. Ahwatukee, however, let me down. We brought my out of town relatives and the service was horrible. We were waiting a long time to be greeted, to receive drinks, and then our food took unusually long. When it did come out, it was the wrong order. Perhaps it was a combination of a poorly trained waitress and slow kitchen staff? Either way, it's a disappointment because I live closer to this location and was hoping for a new wine hangout."}
{"text":"This is a must for all you wine bar lovers. Great selection of wine that is constantly changing accompanies an incredible menu. Get there early for a solid happy hour."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We ordered this for lunch at the office and everyone was raving about it, even the hardest to please."}
{"text":"Saw a re-run on Check Please Arizona, so decided to go for lunch and see for ourselves.  We had 2 pasta dishes which were delicious and tried the Boa Burger which was one of the BEST burgers we've ever had anywhere!  What an amazing little find inside a rather rundown strip center in Ahwatukee.  Don't be fooled by the center itself - go in and enjoy the kitchen artistry of chef Martine.  Caffe Boa is the real deal - in the same location for 20 years."}
{"text":"The food at Cafe Boa is amazing. Our server \"Jared\" was very incredible and made great suggestions on what to try.  We also had the best bus girl.  She \"Devyn\" was so attentive and really went out of her way to make our dining experience enjoyable. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Just left Caffe Boa.  We chose to go there because the web site advertises happy hour until 6:30.  We had already ordered two glasses of wine prior to 6, then right at 6:00 we ordered two appetizers that were suppose to be 1/2 off during happy hour.  We were informed, \"sorry, happy hour ended at 6 and they are now full price.\"  I said, really, your website advertised happy hour until 6:30.  Waiter said sorry, too late, it ends at 6.  Suprise, happy hour ends at 6, not 6:30 as advertised.  And it was straight up 6:00 on the dot - really?  So, dissapointed we still went ahead and ordered entrees for dinner.  
Food was excellent, and ambience nice.  But, bill came.  Shocked by prices and that the wine ordered during happy hour was not at happy hour prices, but full price.  Paid bill, but waiter probaby was not happy with tip.
False advertisement. Not customer friendly.  Good bye."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this restaurant from other people.Im not a fan of huge chain restaurants. I wanted something in Ahwatukee and with a specialized feel. Decided that it was a perfect location for an executive dinner for work. 25 people and they didn't stress about it. Talked to Scott who was so accommodating. He offered to let us use the full menu and not a special \"large party\" menu. We started with 25 and by the end of the night we were 30!!! The wait staff took care of us like we were the only people in the restaurant. The food was amazing! Everyone raved about it the next day! Caffe BoA Ahwatukee made me look great!! I will definitely be back for more events! 
THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Reasonable prices. Unfortunately staff is not very knowledgeable and are rushing you trough your meal.
Plus they allow people to smoke cigars which is incredibly annoying and grosses you out."}
{"text":"I thought it was a great Italian lunch spot- didn't blow my mind, but definitely better than most Italian places for a lunch meeting.  Waiter was very nice and the setting was great."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Caffe Boa this past Wednesday. Amazing atmosphere and vibe, very classy and elegant.

We had the Salsiccia Contadina as an appetizer and it was delicious. Very large portion for a starter.

For our entres we had the Chicken special. Good but no overly impressive. We also had the Voodoo Penne. The Penne was absolutely phenomenal. 

I was very impressed with the service, Bethany was great. I will surely return soon and recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"WOW!  I was REALLY shocked on how good the food was!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food always good, never great. My big complaint is that the menu items have been the same since 1995. Very nice employees. Service always good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable evening.  Food for all 8 of us was excellent.   Bread with aiole was unexpected surprise and was fantastic.  Only sour note was under staffed wait crew.  We marveled that one person could accomplish what she did.  But she needed help."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and from the experience I will be back many more times. I had the special seared scallops in a leak cream sauce, melt in your mouth goodness. My husband had a more classic dish and it was just as good as mine. We got the bruschetta to start and it was flavorful and the bread was nice and crunch. The patio was a very nice surprise, you don't feel like you are in a strip mall. They have a decent wine selection and next time I am hoping to save room for desert."}
{"text":"We (3 colleagues including myself) stopped in today around 11:20 am for lunch.  It was completely empty, great.  There was a strong smell of old dirty mop water that filled the room.  I think the waitress noticed our faces.  My colleague asked if we could sit outside (because of the smell).  The waitress walked us outside but gave us the disclaimer that they just finished washing off the tables and chairs (everything was wet).  So inside we went.

One colleague ordered the Steak Medallions with French Fries and Steamed Vegetables (Broccoli and peppers).  It's not on the menu but on the \"Specialties\" wall inside of the restaurant.  It was delicious! My other colleague ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  I didn't try it but he said it was okay, nothing significant about it. I ordered the Salmon Burger, no sides accompanied the sandwich.  The salmon burger is served with a side of lemon aioli - it's scrumptious.  It should be served with it on the sandwich.  The salmon cuts were thick and cooked to perfection.  Despite the 3 star rating, I would try the restaurant again."}
{"text":"On February 14, 2014 we went to Cafe Boa for our Valentine's Day dinner.  They offered a three-course menu at $48.95 per person.  The first course offered a Spring mix salad with watercress, candied walnuts, goat cheese and pistachios with Champagne vinaigrette dressing.  The second course offered a choice of three:  A) pan seared halibut over a bed of rice pilaf, brussel sprouts and root vegetable; B) handmade duck raviolis on seasoned broth and herbs; and C) medallion of beef, medium rare, with a peppercorn reduction.  Peruvian whipped potatoes and vegetables.  The third course offered a chocolate torte with fresh berries.

There sitting arrangement times were 5pm, 7pm and 9pm and we chose to dine at 7pm.  We arrived 15 minutes early and there were still a lot of nice tables open.  Of all the places they decided to sit us was in front of and near the men's restroom door.  Having to look at that door during our meal seemed disgusting and we asked for another table.  They said they understood and set us at another table.  Why, in a nice restaurant, would they even think of putting a dining table in sight of the men's restroom door?  How crass!

After we were seated, we lucked out and got a really nice person to wait on us.  We ordered a very nice bottle of Pinot Grigio, which was wonderful, and as soon as it was brought to our table we ordered our dinner.

Cafe Boa has a great ambiance and it was so romantic, until they brought us the first course.  The salad looked delicious, but it was awful.  It was mostly the Spring mix, with two very small cherry tomatoes, two candied walnut halves and a piece of goat cheese that was about one-inch round and a quarter in thick.  When I took my first bite, it was acrid tasting and made my nose crinkle.  There was hardly any dressing to be had.  After the second bite, I was done with my salad.  My husband ate half of  his, saying the only reason he did was because he was hungry.

My husband loves fish, so for his second course he had ordered the halibut.  He took one bite and said it was disgusting and very fishy tasting, which meant it was either frozen at one time or it was just old.  It was supposed to be pan seared, but the piece of fish they used was way too thick to be able to sear properly.  Thus, it was crusty on the ends and very dry in the middle.  He tried cutting into one of the brussel sprouts with a knife, with no avail, and made the comment that they were so hard he could use them for golf balls.  I had ordered the beef medallions and the peppercorn reduction was so thick it was more like an old-fashioned gravy.  A reduction is supposed to be flavorful and bring out the taste in the beef, but the flavor was horrible and I couldn't even taste the beef.  I don't like restaurant vegetables, so I gave them to my husband and he said they were okay.  The whipped potatoes were good, but nothing to brag about.  After getting part way though the second course, the person who was waiting on us came over to ask how good the food was and I told her the truth...that it was awful from the beginning.  She asked if there was anything she could do about it, but I just told her there was nothing that could be done; that even if she brought us another plate it would probably be the same.

For the third course, we had the chocolate torte and berries, two small berries to be exact.  The cake part was tasteless, but the icing and the pudding in the middle was good.

All in all, despite the food not being up to par, my husband and I had a nice time and enjoyed ourselves.  We told each other that neither of us would ever go back to Cafe Boa again, especially for a wonderful occasion such as Valentine's day!"}
{"text":"This is our new local favorite! Food is outstanding, service is fabulous and the patio is a wonderful place to spend an Arizona evening. Luis is our favorite, always with excellence service. Save room for the butter cake...it's so amazingly good!"}
{"text":"After a lot of hype, we decided to check the place out. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which was mediocre. The maranara didn't taste fresh and the flavors were off. The calamari was okay. We ordered a caesar salad to split and the staff was nice enough to serve it on two plates for us. Unfortunately, the lettuce was not cleaned well enough because there was still dirt on it. Now, I can understand that that may happen every once-in-a-while but I would really like it if I NEVER had to experience E-Coli poisoning. We mentioned the salad to the manager and she was very apologetic.
My guest ordered a burger and was more than happy with it. The sauce for the Adriatico pasta plate was not pleasant in flavor or appearance. The dish was more like a noodle soup than anything else. When it comes to Italian food, the noodles should be just wet, NOT swimming. The shrimp that came in the pasta was perfectly cooked and very generously portioned.
Taking everything in to account, the $45 lunch we had there was just not worth it. I highly doubt we'll return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ehh just okay. We celebrated Valentine's a few days early this year and went on the Friday night before. We were expecting a romantic dinner, but the atmosphere left a lot to be desired. First of all, we were seated right by the door, where everyone constantly bumped our table as they walked by, intermittent cold air from the door opening, and a wonderful view of the strip mall parking lot. There were also a few large parties, including one with a very loud toddler. The server was decent, but unaware of the 3 course special their website advertised and a few wines that we asked about. The wine that we ultimately picked was wonderful. The food was good, but not amazing. A little overpriced to me considering the lack of atmosphere. Overall, an okay place for a more casual dinner or drinks. But just not what we had in mind for a romantic dinner out. At the price, it is an occasional splurge for us which was ultimately a tad disappointing."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years but met a friend on Thursday night.  The dinners were outstanding!!!  I had the lasagna (piece was big enough for another meal - which was great), my husband had their ravioli of the day, he is still talking about it, and our friend had the bow tie pasta.  We will definitely be back!!!  Highly recommend if you have a taste for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"Delicious food, comfy atmosphere and great service - Caffe Boa is pretty much perfect.  We've been meeting friends, going to wine dinners and hosting events at the original Caffe Boa in Ahwatukee for more than a decade.  It's by far one of my favorite local restaurants and a frequent Friday night stop. The casual but elegent euro-style bistro is comfortable, with a spacious dining room, a fun bar area and an outdoor patio complete with a fountain and twinkle lights. 

Well known for their professional and attentive service, our favorite servers are Chad, Jorge and Miguel.  Owner Scott Rennard quietly directs the staff, keeping things flowing - but even with a packed house he finds time to mingle with the diners.  

Bartender Jorge shakes a mean martini and keeps the bar lively and fun.  The wine list is serious, current and well-priced. They even have some AZ wines on board. The bar offers1/2 priced happy hour appetizers and always has a friendly clientele - the perfect stop after a long day at work.  On Friday nights, we like to have a drink at the bar and then grab a table on the patio for a romantic dinner by the fountain, listening to live music, drinking wine and relaxing with a 3- or 4-course meal.  

The chef-inspired menu is mostly Italian with splashes of mediterranean and flashes of the southwest. Chefs Jaime and Martin proudly serve only the freshest, seasonal, local produce, grass fed beef, fresh fish and made-to-order pastas. We love the homemade aioli and crusty french bread; Roma or Sonoma salad (tender figs, bufalo moz and crisp apples in the Sonoma); creamy shrimp bisque; Agnolotti Boa (mushroom stuffed ravioli), seared diver scallops with linguine; Voodoo Penne; grass-fed beef tenderloin and mashed potatoes; seared sea bass or fresh halibut - get it with jalepeno sauce if they have it; and an absolute MUST is the Boa Buttercake.  I guarantee you won't find a better dessert anywhere.  It's insanely good.  

If you haven't tried Caffe Boa in Ahwatukee, you should.  Tell them Val and Todd sent you.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night with some coworkers after work.  It was a nice day so we sat out on the patio. I was afraid that since we were close to the road that it would be distracting but they had a fountain outside which drowned out the sound of traffic and was actually quite pleasant.

The waiter started us off with some bread with a sun-dried tomato aioli.  I really liked that! We ordered the bruschetta which was probably my favorite part of dinner. It had balsamic vinaigrette on the bread and there was a but of a spicy kick to the tomatoes, I enjoyed it.

For the main dish I got the agnolotti boa, which was mushroom ravioli in a tomato cream sauce. It was okay, just not impressive."}
{"text":"They close at 11pm we show up after a show at 1020 and they have people inside but have closed...stuff in front of the door and all. Alright, all we wanted was a night cap! Just go to The Wine Cellar, y'all."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews of restaurants in the area, we chose Caffe Boa and were delighted at how perfect it was, and yes, the butter cake is as good as everyone claims.  We arrived at 5:45 and were surprised at how few people were there on a Sat night.  I guess not having a happy hour on Sat was the difference but by the time we left, the place was full. 
Our server was wonderful, prompt and helpful.  The food was delicious with large portions so we all needed boxes.  There were gluten-free options also, even pasta.  
I can highly recommend this place and would go again the next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"There Mothers Day. Food great loved Voodoo penne. Calamari not the best ever but very good. Chianti was good. Couple had the brownies with ice cream.  Allie was excellent and friendly and rest of staff pitched in also. Manager?? Owner?? Nice to talk to. First time visitor but will be back.LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING!"}
{"text":"We just had prickly pear martinis and they were great! Great service. Great patio. We will be returning soon to have a meal"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to have lunch!  I love that they offer a full menu during the day as I prefer to eat my big meal of the day at lunch.  Menu was extensive and the service was wonderful.  My filet was cooked perfectly.  The brownie sundae was terrific - it's more like a flourless cake.  

Super cute place and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Could not even give this establishment a complete try. We went in for an early dinner. Yes, we were greeted by a host / server / bartender. When I stated we had never been here before, the reply was a tad sarcastic being \"We've been here 22 years.\".  Well, then why not SELL your establishment and tell us about your Happy Hour Specials / Drink Specials / Soup of the Day / Dinner Specials etc. etc.

Nothing on the menu stood out as something to try. Especially if the staff can't be bothered to suggest their best sellers. 

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"OK, now I am seriously impressed.  The Owner recognized me on my second visit, and bothered to thank me for visiting again.  How awesome is that!?

Not as awesome as the Tiramisu, which was better than I expected!  And huge!  For a girl like me, that would be what I would change actually: I need smaller portions.

Other than that, I still love this place, and my server was absolutely charming!"}
{"text":"This place is located on the corner of a strip mall. From the outside the 25 yr old strip mall doesn't seem inviting, but the inside and outside areas of the  restaurant are actually quite nice. 

We came here with a party of six on a recommendation from me because I had eaten here twice before and it was very good, although it has been at least a year since I was here. 

The problems began right away. We had a reservation for the outside patio. When seating we were seated in the far corner of the patio with no lights. Could not read the menu. In addition, it was 60 degrees outside and we asked the waiter to light the rollable heaters. He said only 1 of the 5 they had sitting there had gas in it so most of us were quite cold during the whole meal which makes it hard to enjoy (the one heater just didn't pump much heat).  I understand if one of your tanks runs out but 4 of 5 out means you just don't care about it.  This place claims an award winning patio but they sit us in the dark without adequate heat and don't offer to move us or tell us before?  Unacceptable. 

The initial ordering went fine and our appetizers came out pretty quickly. The bruschetta, calamari, and table bread were all good.  However, it took 40 minutes for our main dish to come after we finished the appetizers. For me this much time between starting to eat and get the main dish ruins the meal. The place was not crowded. After about 20 mins I went into the restaurant/bar area and found the waiter watching basketball on the tv entranced. This always bothers me especially when things are late and our drinks aren't getting refilled, which was the case. Even if he wasn't busy at the time he should be walking around checking on things not watching tv. God, I sound like my father.  

So, main dishes were mixed reviews. I heard the salmon was great.  I had the scallops.  They were rubbery and not seared well. I realize that scallops are hard but for a $20 plate I expect better. They were smothered in an Alfredo sauce with pasta.  Way too much sauce and too rich for my tastes. I expected a better tasting sauce with more refinement. In taking a poll it was hit or miss whether people liked their meals. Some did, some didn't. 

Bottom line: one of my pet peeves is expensive restaurants that don't get the basics right or treat you well. This place is at least $30-35 per person and I'd expect them to have the basics figured out. They didn't."}
{"text":"I love this place. I stop whenever I leave Phoenix to drive to Tucson. It is easy to park, close to freeway and always yummy. My favorite is the salmon which is served with beautiful fresh vegetables and a risotto. I like the salmon blacked - such great flavor."}
{"text":"Not good.  I went because I've been to Caffe Boa on Mill Ave, they seem to be very different restaurants.  One, too much sauce served with the pasta dishes, over powering to the point that I fished my ravioli out of the sauce and ate it off my bread plate instead.  It didn't seem to be house made pasta.  The appetizer was over salted, I wanted to send it back but our server was so kind and so good at his job that I didn't want to ruin his night.  There's room for improvement.  The atmosphere is really nice, we enjoyed the fountain on the patio, and the fireplace for warmth."}
{"text":"Summary: I don't say this lightly. I had the best diver scallop dish in my life. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful in the patio area. The service was a bit slow but they had a large party when we were seated at around 9 pm. The drinks were nothing special. The martinis were priced at a premium but did not measure up. The butter cake was well above average. 

The atmosphere has a local, warm feel with custom painting, reveals and furnishings that remind you that you are not in a chain. We got there late but their kitchen is open until 10:15 on Saturday. We asked to sit on the patio since others on yelp had great things to say about it. We were not disappointed. You would never know that you were sitting next to a parking lot with the plants and walls completely isolating you. There is an elegant fountain, outdoor fireplace, and romantic lighting. This is a great place to take a date to. 

We ordered martinis, a cucumber martini and a raspberry and chambord martini. They were small and, frankly, not unique, although they charge a premium price. We decided to skip appetizers and had bread. The bread was fair but nothing special. 

For the entree I ordered the gnocchi with chicken and Prosciutto in a garlic cream sauce. In terms of presentation, it looked like porridge with a couple of green twigs for color. As unappetizing as it looked, it had a pleasant taste with great textures. I would rate it as a slightly above average meal. My girlfriend ordered the  diver scallops rolled in fettuccine.  Presentation on this dish did not do it justice as it looked relatively average with no color or texture variations. The scallops were seared with a smooth butter glaze. They were the size of a child's fist and were perfectly cooked. No fish taste at all. The spices were a great compliment and, everything combined, was as close to a perfect bite as I have had in years. I'd like to think that this is not a case of \"all stars aligning\" and that they can reproduce this at will. If so, I will be one happy and loyal patron. By the way, did you notice that I was describing my girlfriends dish? I took that bad boy over as soon as I saw even the slightest hint of her slowing down. I think she let me go at it because she saw that I was starting to bath myself in the dish. 

Ok, dessert. They have a specialty dish called butter cake. It was a creamy cake, with an almost creme brûlée center. It was not overly sweet but was heavy enough that two would be satisfied by sharing one. It is worth trying and I will have it again. 

I can tell you without a doubt, that despite the lack of presentation, I cannot wait to have an excuse to get back their for those stupidly ridiculous scallops. Beware though, with no appetizer, two entrees, and dessert, the bill came to over $120 with a tip. Don't know abut your pocket books but I would not just stroll into this place. Best if it is planned with some special folks at your side."}
{"text":"Waste of time. My wife and I had 7:00 PM reservations on the patio. The restaurant even called to confirm our reservation. We arrived at 6:45 PM and were told it would be a few minutes. We finally left at 7:45 PM because we had yet to be seated. What's the point of having a reservation if they don't save a table for you? Can't comment on the food, but with service so poor, we won't chance going back."}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely.  Had the antipasto board, with mozzarella, Parmesan, Blue Cheese, and Camembert. I would have liked to have seen some different cheese on the platter. There were to many mild cheeses on the platter, perhaps a nice aged cheddar would have rounded the plate out.  The nuts were good, so were the olives.  We also had the Roma salad which was played beautifully and had some nice greens with a nice balsamic on it.  I had a cranberry and vodka and it was a perfect balance of alcohol and mixer. Service was wonderful as usual.  I would recommend Cafe Boa f a nice evening with friends or your significant other."}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner. The decor is very nice. It is clean and well decorated.  We were greeted right away by a nice young man ,who said we could choose to sit anywhere we wanted.   We chose a table for 2 by the wall.                        The host brougt us water with lemon which was nice.                                                           Our waiter came over asked if we were alright with the water,we wanted to order an starter of Calamari but, he was gone in a flash.  He did come back after a bit and we ordered the Calamari and 1 glass of wine. He was off again.                                             He did not seem that busy but, he never stayed at the table too long.                                       The host brought us our appitzer and bread with spread that was excellant!    Food was great, atmosphere great. Our  waiter seemed like he really did not want to be there, but everything else was great!!                                                      The host was great and answered questions about the food for us.                                      I got the Ahi Tuna and it had this very strange over cooked bird nest of potaoes on top. It was completely hard and there was no way to eat it. My girlfriend gave me some of her rice. Which was good. We asked the waiter ,was is this? He said Potato, why you don't like it. We both said no....He responded ,\"Huh\" and walked away.     Oh well everything can't be perfect... We liked everything else. Parking is a challenge as there is a GOLD 's Gym in the lot and i think they take a  lot of the spots."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty. Beef mediallions, ravoli, etc.
The service lacked something to be desired though.
Took forever to get bread for the table and waters.
No nice greeting with a smile. Too crowded. 
Servers were moving tables around and bumping into my table & chair.
It's was over-priced. Not sure it's worth it to go again."}
{"text":"You will be surprised by the quality of food at Cafe Boa. Set in a little strip mall, you may not expect such a classy bar and restaurant. The service is terrific and the servers will remember you when you come back.
They like to make you happy there with the service, but the real happiness comes from the food and wine selections. It is right off of the freeway.  It will be worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Love this place, lunch is great they have a several different options available. Surprising their burger and fries is fantastic. Salads have always been good."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience here while on a short trip to Phoenix this past weekend.  The patio is pretty with overhead lighting and flowers, even a fountain; a romantic spot for date nights.
The food was amazing as was our friendly and knowledgeable server, Allie. She made great recommendations about the menu items at this elegant Italian eatery.
I ordered  the special blackened salmon with Genovese sauce, like a beurre blanc with capers, lemon and artichoke. Yummy!  My husband had the diver scallops over linguine with a cream sauce. Both entrees were prepared well. We had white wine by the glass, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio with our meal.

Did I forget to mention the house sun-dried tomato aioli that comes with bread to start? That was delicious as well.  The portions were ample and we were so full we did not have room to sample the highly recommended butter cake.  Next time we are in Phoenix we will have to come back and bring some of our friends who live in the area."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I wish this place was better.  I feel I should try something else on the menu because although my main entree looked appetizing it did not have any flavor at all.  I actually got a appetizer for my main entree which was the crostini with a topping picked by the chef each day... today it was a medley of marinated veggies similar looking to a tapenade.  It just had no flavor.  I did get their sonoma salad (small) and it was very tasty.  It had figs, goat cheese, croutons, tomato and a vinaigrette dressing.  Another reason for the mid range score was service... this is lunch time people and I am kind of in a hurry.  There was only one server and what seemed like the manager helping out... not enough people to handle a lunch rush."}
{"text":"The only thing I miss about living in Phoenix is that I can no longer frequent Caffe Boa.  You just can't go wrong here.  The food is outstanding.  Don't let the strip mall fool you.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"It is a nice Italian place for dine and wine. We got a bottle of wine and dinner. The mushroom ravioli was the best and overall food is good here."}
{"text":"A girl friend and I headed here before our trip to shop for a wedding dress - I needed the half bottle of wine we ordered!  Was there a happy hour menu?  Happy hour prices?  We didn't ask, but didn't see anything advertised either.

We shared the plate of cheeses, bread, fruit, etc., and it was pretty tasty.  Loved the dried figs.  We also each ordered the greek (Uro? Oro?) salad, and agreed on the deliciousness of it.  I would definitely order that again.  

Service was a little on the slow side, but we were chatting so much that it was no biggie.  I would love to return and try a few more menu items!"}
{"text":"Server was attentive & made very good suggestions. The dried figs on the Sonoma salad were the right texture but flavors did not completely mesh. Dressing on salad was soupy. Pesto penne delicious...very rich & huge portion. Overall 3 stars. Go on a night they play live music...later in the week"}
{"text":"I actually ate here a few weeks ago with my manager for dinner. First time here and it was delicious. The portions were huge and the price was right. I believe we had the brushetta for appetizers but can't remember what I had for dinner. I do remember that I had the Butter Cake for dessert and that was YUMMY! Yes, it probably was made out of a whole lotta butter, but it was delicious. 

My manager was here the night before and some of our co-workers come here every time they come into town. I thought it was a great atmosphere with people and ate some great food."}
{"text":"Solid date night option in the 'Tuk we can walk to? Yes, please! In the same car park with The Bagel Man and Sakana, Caffe Boa is a charming restaurant with a lovely patio out back which frequently features live music. 

We've been for Happy Hour, apps, lunch, brunch, and dinner. I only took pics at dinner, which was very good - standout was antipasto platter - and our server Allie was a delight; peep the album to check the snaps. Scott loves ravioli and pesto sauce, the the Angolotti with subbed pesto made him very happy. My stuffed sunfish was expertly prepared, and the antipasto was so large, we took half home. The shrimp bisque and crostini are consistently good choices, every soup I've tried here, I've enjoyed. 

It seems to always be busy, so reservations are a good idea. They have specials on the board daily, a full bar with HH specials, and the staff from FOH to service are on point. 

They have wine pairing dinners occasionally, and they are reasonably priced, too. Oh, my Mom went crazy for their butter cake! Also, this location is not affiliated with the Tempe restaurant with same name. 

We are fans, and will continue to patronize this neighborhood gem.

{"text":"I came here last night with my grandma and we started with the crostini boa appetizer which included a prosciutto crostini, salmon crostini,  bacon and date crostini and a tomato basil crostini. Each had a different cheese too. Delicious.

We shared a creamy bow tie pasta that had chicken, asparagus and sun dried tomatoes. Also delicious.  

My grandma and I liked the general vibe and had very good service. Our waitress,  Allie, was good about checking up on us and all of our food came in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary dinner and the entire evening was the worst I have ever had from the waitress that we never saw after she took our order to the food that was so bad my dog wouldn't even eat it.  I had ordered the Gnocchi and it was so salty that the slugs outside were shriveling up and my partner ordered the Filet medium rare and it came out RARE and cold we got the hostess attention and she took it back to the kitchen to have it cooked more and it was back out in exactly a minute and a half hmmm do you think it was cooked NOT... When our waitress did show up she just dropped off the check and someone else took it to ring up and brought it back.  No one ever asked how anything was nor do I think they even cared."}
{"text":"First time @ Boa. My dinner took a long time to come out. I had the beef medallion special. Asked for medium, but was more well done. Some bites even had a burnt taste. The sauce was tasty (Marsala style). I would rate the food quality less than The Olive Garden. The waiter was nice but very busy. Doesn't appear they were expecting the crowd they had. Would I try Boa again? Probably not. Cute place though."}
{"text":"Good!
Very good!  
Met a friend here for happy hour with my hubby.   Got some wine, beer, and the antipasto plate.  Was a LOT of food... and very tasty!
They allowed us to have the password for their wifi, which was also very nice.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really had no idea what Caffe Boa was. I just had had a feeling it was good, and I wanted to eat there. Call it \"gut instinct.\" But the name and logo had me thinking it was a New American or Fusion cuisine cafe. No, that wasn't it at all. Caffe Boa is Italian. And about as Italian as you can get. I mean, made-from-scratch, obsessive, \"we know what we're doing so don't ask too many questions\" Italian. Capisci?

Oh, and the food...DELICIOUS. They do know what they're doing. I've tried a bunch of dishes, and can't really say a bad thing about any of them. The salads are perfectly-dressed (not a dry leaf, but not sitting in a pool of dressing either). The soups are homemade and amazing (try the Lentil if they have it that day). The Lasagna will have the pleasure center of your brain firing neurons it didn't even know it had. Also, the Voodoo pasta & chicken dish is like...it's just like \"wow.\" The quality of food really can't be beat. You can tell they take an exceptional amount of pride in every dish they serve.

The menu isn't extensive. So, if you don't feel like pasta, fish, salad, or soup, then you're not going to find much else on the menu -- there are other offerings, just not many of them. But anything you do order is going to be very tasty. Has been for me anyway. 

The ambiance is sort of upscale...but I felt at ease in my hoodie and jeans too. But it is nice inside. And it's VERY dark in the evening. They play Smooth Jazz and have a big wine selection. Not a bad place to take a date I guess (although I usually go with family).

The service is...? Service is good...I might even say \"very good\" actually. But I wouldn't really say it's \"friendly.\" More urbane than amicable. Think \"east coast friendly.\" But even without a lot of smiles, they get the job done. Also, I like when places pay attention to details. For instance, Caffe Boa serves Stella in the Stella glass and Guinness in a Guinness pint glass (both of which they have on tap). It's a small detail, but it shows that they're aware of what they're doing. So, props for that.

Overall, this place is very good. It's my go-to spot for Italian in Ahwatukee now....and there are a lot of Italian places in Ahwatukee. But I think Caffe Boa's food beats them all so far."}
{"text":"Where to take my fiancé' for valentines dinner? GOT IT, CAFE BOA!!!!

I called ahead for reservations......\"We have a 5:30 and a 9pm left.
PERFECT, I'll take the 5:30.......\"OK, see you at 5:30 on the 14th.\"

As we drive from east Gilbert to  Ahwatukee, all dressed up and romantic we enter to a 1/2 empty restaurant. OH........dinner is a fixed menu tonight AND $60 per person.
DO YOU THINK someone on the phone while taking my reservations could of told me that?
Nothing like looking like an idiot on V-day!!  We had to bail and look for another place.
Sorry Boa, you left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Eh.  Decent wine, decent food.  I enjoyed our trip there, but thought the pricing was a bit much for just \"okay\" food.  

May be back, may not.  Cute little place but there a lot of those with better pricing."}
{"text":"Usually a great place... Unique outside sitting and great martinis but on NYE the 40$ plus scallop dinner was disgusting!!! I'm sorry. It was nasty... My finance's filet mignon was good though...We will still go to dinner there since during the week everything is great :)"}
{"text":"Tonight we celebrated Father's Day at Caffe Boa. We had a reservation set through opentable for 4:00 and we were the only ones in the restaurant at that time! 
 It felt as if we rented out the place just for us, and the service was amazing. We indulge in every course offered, drinks, appetizers, dinner, and dessert. Each course was magnificent and the flavors sprang through on each. I would recommend the stuffed sunfish as a meal. The fish was light flavorful and the sauce added to each side dish ( rice and steamed vegetables). We where given a wide range wine list but we opted for spirits I had the blackberry martini and my husband had the afternoon the afterthought monsoon ( it was like a lemonade with a kick. When we came to dessert we went with the butter cake which was a very sweet ending to a very memorable meal. Caffe Boa made our Father's Day celebration just perfect and we plan to visit again"}
{"text":"Oil, vinegar and spices for dipping your bread in is always a good start for me. We had a lovely early dinner at Caffe Boa, with dim lighting, a festive holiday tree and pleasant, attentive service. The specials sounded delicious but, we went traditional instead. We shared a half order of Sonoma Salad, (organic mixed greens, dried mission figs, sliced apples, fresh bufala mozzarella, with a raspberry vinaigrette). It was big enough to share, and each have a nice pre-pasta portion.

For the entree, I was delighted by the AGNOLOTTI BOA, which are, as per the website, \"Raviolis filled with a soft blend of portabella and cremini mushrooms in a flavorful sauce of tomato and seasoned cream.\"  My dining partner had the lasagna, which was delicious, but too much even for him.  We took it home and enjoyed it again the next day.  That, of course meant we had room for dessert, so we went for espressos and the housemade tiramisu.  It was light and fluffy and, again, a giant portion. 

Service was very pleasant and not rushed. The patio looks cute and romantic for a return visit."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great salad with plenty of chicken. The service was optimal and as I recall from previous visits the staff is easy on the eyes.

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great little find. Inside and outside dining options. For a starter I ordered the Calamari Insalata - very good (1/2 portion), For Dinner the Agnolotti Boa -Raviolis - Excellent, for dessert we shared the homemade Cannoli - PERFECTO!"}
{"text":"I am going to gush about this place....sorry...I might go overboard, sue me. I absolutely love Caffe Boa. This is NOT associated with the one on Mill. Please disregard them when comparing the two. Its apples and oranges. This site does not get barely enough pub, which is truly a damn shame. Well, lets change that!

~Fud/Drink~
I have attended here a couple times. Each time, the food has been exquisite. No other way to put it. Their take on European-American values along with their blended emphasis on using local and sustainable foods, they do it perfectly. Last time we went was for Valentines Day 2012, and I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. It is hard to explain how beautiful the flavors were in this dish. They crashed in my mouth and unleashed flavors I haven't tasted in many years. I tried a bit of my fiance's beef dish, and was floored at the tenderness and flavor as well. The management tends to include many new options from time to time, so when you stop in after a while, expect to see new options that taste great. The wines here are paired perfectly for the foods on the menu. They also place such a fine emphasis on sustainability with their wines, by the way. They have a wide variety as you would expect. The owner makes sure to keep up with his stock and changes it up from time to time in turn with his menu. Finally, everyone loves the different desserts on the menu, its just not my thing. But from everything I have heard, they are just as good as the dishes that you just ate. The chef here has perfected the more elegant sides of a Euro-American dish, it is such a pleasure to eat here. 

~Atmosphere/Service~
Sterling S. is spot on with the ambiance. I say awesome too much in my reviews, so he said it more me. Tucked inside of this small venue is a beautiful room and patio which is intimate and inviting. I highly suggest this spot anytime you need to take your special someone out for a extra-special night. The waitstaff are also spot-on. I haven't had a single bad experience with anyone here. They treat you very well, and seem to have ESP...because they come back at the right time. If I have a question about something on our bill, they take the time to answer my Questions, and do not huff if I ask for help splitting a portion of the bill. As with any fine-dining establishment, they are highly knowledgeable of their menu, but they also keep a keen tab on the wines as well. Ask them for a good wine to pair your dish with, and they will have an answer. 

~Extras/Rating~
I have a couple things to note. They do have mid-afternoon happy hour specials on food and drinks.They also have enough area on the patio outside to offer live music from time to time. The live music is always paired well with the quiet interior, and sets the mood well. Finally, they offer every few months a specific wine/food event, normally wine-related. They update their website from time to time for these events, but I suggest you call ahead of time to see what is going on that day/week and in the future. They get a 5 star rating because of the high quality food, enchanting service and ambiance, variety of events, and the general charm the site exudes. I can't think of a finer food establishment in Ahwatukee, its a gem."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for my companies holiday party (clever investor). I must say that the service was great! Food came out quickly and it was delicious! I got the filet and she got the sea bass. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was the worst. I was put at a table in the middle of everything and was bumped a million times. I used to love this place. I won't be back. Only go if you want to eat 5 ravioli on a plate swimming in sauce."}
{"text":"Great fusion of Mediterranean and Italian food. I got the Voodoo Penne which consists of murkier colored penne pasta, blackened chicken, tossed in a cream sauce with bell peppers and tomatoes. This is one of of their popular dishes. Very delicious! The atmosphere here is wonderful. If weather permits sit outside and enjoy their terrace. I happen to be here during a night they had live music. It was pretty awesome. Try it, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went there last night with boyfriend and one of his clients. I recommended the place based on Yelp reviews and boy am I sorry.  Got there around 6.00 and was told to sit anywhere. Waitress came over, gave us a menu, and took our drink order. She came back with my wine, which probably had about 3 oz. of wine.  My boyfriends client really didn't want Italian food - which seems to be the predominant genre, with a Greek twist, so he ordered a salad. I ordered a calamari Insalata, boyfriend order the Adriatic chicken, which was mostly pasta, and his client order some type of BLT salad. After we ordered, we noticed a \"specials\" board, which the waitress failed to mention. Oh we'll... Our order was already in. Food arrived fairly quickly, but none of us was very impressed with our orders. Service was mediocre, food was mediocre, don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"We love this place, and eat here every time we're in town.  The prices are reasonable, even on their wine menu.  It's nice to have a bottle of Justin, out on the patio. And while the apps are a great addition, I seldom have the room.  The meals are delicious, and I love that they're more original than I've found at other places.  The wait staff has always been knowledgable and friendly.  I, personally, haven't had any service problems here.  It's likely more appropriate for an adult crowd.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food and the atmosphere here but the service is on and off. Some visits, we are served with a friendly face and efficient attitude, but I've also been for lunch and felt completely forgotten about, even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. However, I am going to take it as an off-day and won't hold it against them! I really enjoy their salads and pastas. Everything is hearty and homey. It's a welcoming environment for the suburbia-ville area!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for 11 but our party emerged to 13. They accommodated us immediately as the restaurant was really slow. Food was excellent but service was horrible, waitress was rude and management was unconcerned with our concerns. 
9 people were done eating before 4 even got their food. We were there 90+ minutes and not once were our water glasses refilled, if we needed a cocktail we had to flag down the waitress. 
Great product but the service caused a dark, unpleasant shadow on the entire evening.  We (as well as the other 11) will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"The food is over priced and mediocre. No prices are noted on specials board. We spent over 100 dollars on a meal Saturday night at another restaurant  that beat this 100 dollar one hands down. The aioli starter with bread tasted like pureed tuna salad instead of an aioli. The scallop dish was bland. The scallops could have stood more of a sear and the fettucine should have been dressed with a blended cream and lemon instead of the heavy alfredo used on the dish. Dessert was tiramisu and yes , it was bland too. No taste of marsala or any other liquer soaking the cake of the tiramisu. Over all this was a waste of an effort to have a good meal at a new place for us."}
{"text":"I don't eat here enough!  Every time I come to Boa, I have an excellent meal and a great experience.  The chef knows what he is doing and it shows in quality and presentation of the food.  The butter pie reminds me of buttermilk pie I used to get back in Austin, TX.  Definitely worth a try if you are in the area and like Italian food.

Also, good ambiance and nice patio with lots of live plants and a water fountain."}
{"text":"Lasagna is fantastic!

They say their Voodoo Chicken Penne is a signature dish but it is pretty average.

Great service, nice patio when the weather is cool."}
{"text":"QUESADILLAS VIANA=Large Flour Tortilla filled with tender sliced chicken, diced asparagus, melted cheeses and diced green onions served aside sour cream and pico di gallo.  Need I say more than the description???"}
{"text":"Didn't know about this place!  OMG INCREDIBLE!!!  2/13/16 went with friends and WOW, food was awesome, Cadillac Margaritas fantastic!  Only down was wait staff, waitress knowledgeable and friendly, getting water, bread and drink refills was very slow, would have had at least another round of drinks but slow service prevented.  The place was busy, but not packed.  Will definitely be back when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Another great meal-lunch.  I went out a bit and picked a pasta that was vegetables only; but in a decadent cream sauce.
Cowabunga!
So delicious.
I was very happy with my choice.
A stand out -the peas! They seemed an afterthought to me- but they were so plump, sweet and juicy they really stood out!

I highly recommend this dish.

Food always 5 star, service 4-5 sometimes, but hey, 4 star is very good- and the food?
It rocks!!!

{"text":"My husband and I came here Thursday night. We were promptly greeted at the hostess stand and seated outside on their charming patio. From this moment on, we did a lot of waiting around.  From what I could tell,  there were three servers,  two of which seemed to be extremely attentive,  and then there was our server. 

 Once he finally came to the table we asked him about two different Alexander wines which appeared to be the same but had different prices and descriptions.  He said they were indeed the same thing and it was a menu typo; he However didn't mention which description was the correct one. We ordered a half bottle and when he came back with it, we commented that since it was indeed on the smaller side that we would take another one.  He either thought we were kidding or ignored us because the second bottle never came. 

There were quite a few specials that night And our server was pretty knowledgeable about those.  We ended up ordering the bolognese pasta and a procuitto wrapped chicken breast with pasta.  Shortly after ordering, we finished our wine and wanted to have a second glass. Our server took the wine list away and after waiting quite a while for him to return, I went to the bar myself and asked for a menu.  

The food finally arrived and I was underwhelmed. The chicken seemed really thin for some reason and the rest of the plate seemed lacking.  My husband seemed to like his bolognese pasta, but when I took a bite all I could taste was a really strong spice. I couldn't put my finger on it but I'd say it was either cinnamon or nutmeg. It would have been inedible for me.

For dessert we ordered the brownie with ice cream, which we should have known better not to get when the server stated \"it's a brownie that the cook heats up\". Against better judgement we wanted chocolate and ordered it anyway.  The brownie was way too rich and the ice cream was clearly store bought; sadly the best part of the dessert for me was the strawberry on top. 

After dessert, we again found ourselves waiting for our server and check.  It seemed as though he had vanished into thin air. 

We won't be back to cafe boa. A dinner that should have taken us an hour, lasted over two because the service was bad. The food was simply mediocre for me as well."}
{"text":"Went to Caffe Boa last friday before a movie, the food was pretty good but I wasn't impressed. I know Fridays are busy at any restaurant, but  the wait staff was extremely slow. We didn't have to wait for a seat when we arrived, but we were sat at a table that was sticky and filthy. Drinks took much longer than they should have, and we were not very impressed. The food was very good but other than that, this place wouldn't be our first choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was top notch. We had the steak medallions, very very tender and the Salmon. Both were high quality."}
{"text":"I have been to Caffe Boa twice - once on April 2016 and again in June 2016. My first experience was fantastic, leading to a second visit, but my second experience was so poor that I doubt I will ever go back. The food was extremely salty, and took over 20 minutes to arrive. (Two plates of pasta.) Once we had our food, our server did not return, and eventually the bartender had to bring our bill. 
There was a large, loud party in the restaurant, so I thought perhaps this group showed up unexpectedly and the staff was simply not prepared. However, while we were waiting for our server to check in, she told the party that the bill did not include the deposit to secure the space. Perhaps they were short staffed or something else had happened, but there was no communication. A simple comment when we sat down that they were slammed and would do the best they could, or any communication, would have made all the difference. Instead, our server walked past us without checking in twice. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great patio.
Been here twice now and the Crostini Boa is SO, SO wonderful--such a lovely array of flavors and textures! Ideal for a lunch/light dinner/late-night-nosh/appie ($15) with wine.
I'm sure I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Never a bad time...

I love Boa.  I have been going there for several years now.  There is nothing on the menu I haven't tried and I love it all.  Now is the time of year to go, the outdoor patio rocks; there is a huge tree and fountain, plenty of shade and has a \"back yard garden\" feel.

If the Patio isn't your style, you need to sit at the bar.  The regular bartender is Jorge who is excellent at keeping your drink full and cracking jokes.  When i go, usually get a martini (which even at $10 is a bargain base on the quality and volume).  If you love wine, Boa wont disappoint, they usually have a good malbec on their specials board.  

As far as what to eat - Since i normally go during happy hour (most appatizers are 50% off) I get the bruschetta and then the Valentino salad and add salmon.  This is a great way to go.  The salmon is always fresh and always cooked perfectly.  

Take a friend, sit at the bar or on the Patio."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with my boyfriend and his son. There was literally one other party in the whole place, sitting inside. We chose to sit out on the patio. It was a nice little area with a pretty fountain. I can see how it would be a really nice ambience in the evening when there is live music out there.
We sat down and very clearly stated that we were there for the happy hour. After looking over the menu and deciding on some happy hour options, the waiter came back and said that the manager informed him that happy hour deals are only good if you sit AT the bar. First of all: We were one of the only parties there. Really? You want us to leave the one table you have outside to sit at the bar? Secondly: We clearly had a child with us, therefore we couldn't have sat at the bar. 
I just don't understand why they wouldn't give us happy hour pricing. We still ordered drinks/appetizers off of the happy hour menu, but paid full price for everything.
The food was mediocre, nothing great. I got the bruschetta and my boyfriend got the quesadilla. 

It was just disappointing first experience but I will come back because it's super close to our place. Next time we will come kid-free to sit at the bar and get the full happy hour experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. From the ecclectic Italian menu with an  incredible list of pastas to their extraordinary salads. Service is attentive and knowledgeable. And such beautiful ambience and space. The outdoor patio makes you forget you're? even in a city,  with the soft sound of the fountain and the twinkling patio lights. In addition they have an extensive wine menu and some of the best Martini's I've ever had. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went to Caffe Boa last night for dessert with some friends. This was our first time at this restaurant and the 1st impression was great. Very quaint little Italian cafe with nice ambiance. 

The service was less than impressive. When we said we were just having drink & dessert to our waiter, he gave us an annoyed look & a very drawn out 'ohhhkay'. It was 5 min until we got water then another 5 before we got the drinks we ordered. Our order was taken shortly after the drinks arrived, which was fine. About 15 min later, our waiter comes back to tell us he forgot what we ordered & wanted to make sure he had it right. We re-ordered and 20 min later we had our desserts. 

The quality of the food we had was very good. The creme brulee was very well prepared. The cannoli was large and in charge, stuffed with yummy filling. The wild berry sorbet was superb & refreshing. The dark choclate brownie w/ ice cream was SUPER rich & more resembled dark chocolate fudge. 

A+ for the food & atmosphere, but a solid D for the service."}
{"text":"We were actually going to eat next door at Sanaka(sp?) but the wait was too long so we decided to pop in to look at their menu. From the outside Caffe Boa looks like a dingy maybe mom and pop type restaurant, but the inside was a different story. Very cute and romantic place. We opt to sit inside since it was a little cold outside. They had live music with a gentleman playing acoustics outside too. It was loud so if you want to talk, ask to sit inside.

Next, the food -- we ordered two of their specials - the clams with linguini and blacken salmon, the bow tie pasta, and their lasagna. They gave very large portions and I like that they use expensive ingredients. For example, the bow tie pasta I asked for shrimp instead of chicken and they were colossal shrimps. They were very generous with the clams too. My favorite was the blacken salmon. The jalapeño sauce was to die for! I also really liked their mix veggies with the salmon. It was hearty - they had carrots, brussels sprouts, green beans, onions, asparagus, bell peppers, and broccoli. YUM! The basmati rice that came with it was also delicious and tastes really good with the jalapeño sauce.

Only bad thing was our server, who also was the bartender forgot our bread and silverware and we needed to ask another server (this Asian girl), who was SUPER nice. Almost wished she was our server because our server seemed a bit overwhelmed even though he didn't have many tables and one couple at the bar. Overall, good team work because where our server lacked the other people made up for. Even the busser towards the end was very attentive and cleared our plates promptly multiple times. Will be back whenever when we come back into town."}
{"text":"For New Year's Eve they had a simplified menu and a price increase but it was New Year's Eve so that was to be expected. We had neglected to reserve a table but had no trouble getting seated. With the heaters outside we were very warm, and we're smokers so we were glad to be outside anyways. The wine was perfect and sweetly priced for the wine lover who doesn't have a large checkbook. I got the Surf & Turf which was absolutely wonderful. The steak was perfectly seasoned and properly cooked (I ordered Medium). It was so good I couldn't stop \"mmming\". The lobster tail was also done nicely and what I didn't finish at the restaurant was made into a lovely lobster omelette the next day. My husband and I were both very satisfied with the food and the service. Ask for Allie when you stop by and you really should stop by. My husband and I will be going back for our anniversary."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Caffe Boa for my birthday last night. We'd been meaning to go for a while, and I'm glad we finally went. We showed up around 7-7:30 on a Tuesday night, and the indoor dining room is a bit small so we had to wait for a few minutes. The patio outside looks much larger, with pretty lights and foliage, and some heaters for the chilly weather.

Our server brought out some french bread with a tasty dip/spread that I later found out to be aioli, which was topped with cracked black pepper and parmesan cheese. Soooo tasty! A unique alternative to so many places that serve their bread with oil/vinegar.

We each started with the House Dinner Salad which was maybe the best simple salad I've ever had. Fresh greens, grape tomatoes, thin spears of cucumber and celery, shaved ribbons of carrot, and some other veggies I can't quite recall. The vinaigrette dressing was amazing as well.

I ordered the Tortellini Brigantino. Very fresh tasting, wonderfully prepared broccoli which was not overcooked in the slightest. Fresh green peas and a very rich cream sauce, with fresh pepper and cheese as well. My boyfriend got the Kobe Burger special. It was very tender with great flavor, though a little greasy, he felt. Also maybe a bit heavy handed with the blue cheese.  It was served with thin, crispy fries.

We wanted to share their butter cake for dessert but I was told that the adjoining table had gotten the last piece! Oh, sad day :( We settled on the homemade cannoli, which was still very good. I don't know if the cannoli shells are made in-house, but they were sweeter and more cinnamon-y than most I've had elsewhere.

I would like to come back so I can try the butter cake, as well as some of the other tasty-sounding menu items."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Sunday. We got in right around the time kitchen was about to close (9pm) but none the less we were served a delicious dinner with an outstanding service. I wish I had the server name.. he was just fabulous. This was my third time going to this place over three years time span but every time I have a really good experience. So I am not sure how this place ended up with rather low reviews. Putting my 5 starts as it is very well deserved."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I work my way through this dinning experience. I have enjoyed Cafe Boa in the past, but it has been years. 

So far we are off to a good start. The restaurant is decorated in soothing colors, clean and relaxing.

The server is very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Wild Salmon with Basmati Rice and sautéed veggies sounds great. Thanks!

Uh oooh! The tea is weak on tea on heavy on hibiscus or jasmine or dandelion, whatever they flavor it with. Oh, and did I mention it's empty...... and they aren't terribly busy and I'm sitting at the bar. 

Tick-tock, Tick-tock...for as long as this is taking I'm concerned that my Salmon will be over cooked. It's not that busy people.

Tick-tock, Tick-tock...the wait staff must sense it, because they are leaning half way through the kitchen window looking for food. I guess this is why they have a decent beer and wine selection, gotta keep you happy during the wait. Too bad I'm only drinking iced tea. 

Tick-tock, Tick-tock...as I sit and watch larger tables that came in after me being served their food. It's Salmon not rocket science.

The Salmon is a beautiful piece of fish and nearly perfectly cooked. The fish is great but I'm confused on where the chef was going with this dish. It has a \"corn relish\" on top that is really just corn. It all sits on top of a bed of rice and veggies. The veggies are nicely cooked but they have a Asian flavor that doesn't match the rest of the dish. 

Well, I was going to rate it a 3 star until I got my bill and saw they charged me $19.95 for that dish. Definitely not worth it.

Hi all,

The owners response to my original review is below. I did reply back to him directly, but I don't think it will be shown to all so I am adding my response here.Enjoy the reading.



Dear Scott,

Really Scott?  \"Tea was full at all times, never empty as you stated\" You want to call me a liar? Not a good plan for salvaging relationships with potential customers. Trust me when I say it was empty....I know. 

\"we understand that you were by yourself\" This means there is only one dish to focus on, it's easy.

\"the ticket time on the Grilled Salmon was not unreasonable\" If this is the case then why was the waiter appologizing for it and why were other tables of 3 people receiving their food before me? If the ticket time was appropriate in your judgement then it is likely that either the server failed to submit the order in  a timely manner or you have a IT/ticketing system issue. 

\"Your dish, as you stated, was perfectly cooked\" Yes the salmon was perfectly cooked and it was a georgeous pice of fish, but beyond the Salmon there was little flavor and what flavors there were, they did not blend together to make a satisfying dish. It was for this reason that the price was unreasonable. It was not a good dish.

\"Perfect service and not even a 15% gratuity, really?\" Ohhh, I'm sorry you must have missed the part about the empty iced tea, long wait, other more complex orders for a larger group of people coming out before mine, a main dish that the flavors didn't blend well and ice tea that I didn't like. I am a tipper that over gives and you have to work hard to get less than 20%. That tip was an earned tip plus a generous donation considering the experience.

Your response has helped solidify my 2 star rating of Cafe Boa.

Hi all,

One last update from me. I thought you might be interested in seeing the private note that the owner of Cafe Boa sent to me as a response to my last posting.

Cheers,

To: Gary S. 

\"I apologize for my following tone, but your response warrants the following:
My response isnt to make you change your rating, it really doesnt matter to me,  most normal people know when some reviews are legit and reasonable and some are just ridiculous and silly. We have thrived for 16+ years, no thanks to people like you. The fact of the matter is that your experience was Flawless, we serviced you with perfection,.. you were just looking to trash our establishment. Most of your comments above arent worth responding to, they are so silly.  We served you in a timely manner, albeit not as fast as you wanted, a high quality meal with friendly service and in return you sit there at our Bar during your entire meal, typing on Yelp any flaw you could find, wow, kinda sad, really. If you are a food critic, ok then I would understand, otherwise, get a life.
We will be here for another 16+ years, you can count on that.\"

{"text":"I went here a few nights ago for a work Christmas dinner. It was my first time and most likely my last. 

Everything was just OK. 

Our waiter was an older man who acted like he had better things to do all night. Each time he came to the table I always said thank you and he never acknowledged me saying it to him once. 

The place was PACKED FULL. Like so full that they came to our table and asked if they could take our extra chair (that we had all our purses and presents piled onto). It was also extremely loud in there, you have to lean in to hear what your fellow dining companions are saying to you. 

The food was alright. I ordered the Voodoo pasta. It sounded like it might have a kick to it. It was very bland and lack luster. 

Afterward we got dessert. I ordered a brownie. It did not taste like it was fresh baked or even made there. The ice cream they paired it with tasted store bought as well. 

It was a pretty average place, and not worth the prices they charge there."}
{"text":"Very good pasta, and excellent bread with some amazing yogurt dip.  Outstanding coffee (Folger's?).  Good service. A bit pricey, but the quality is there.  I could eat there
weekly, actually.  Good for any romantic date, too (my date was happy)."}
{"text":"Cafe Boa is not an Italian restaurant. They have Italian-like food, but they do a very good job. As they are a neighborhood place, I go there quite often. They have decorated it very nicely and there is a very nice patio seating in the Winter. I would avoid it when it gets very crowded as it is not that big. Definitely try it on happy hour or for lunch or on week nights."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner here for my daughter and it was fabulous.  The medallions were delicious, but the filet with the peppercorn sauce was out of this world! And the scallop pasta dish was mouth watering good.  The service was absolutely 5 star and the ambiance is beautiful and relaxing.  I personally love the patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to dine here since we had heard good things about the Tempe location. So this location has a completely different menu then Tempe. I ordered a special off the board and was disappointed with the food. Our waitress never stopped back by to check on us after serving us. The $29 sea scallops were smothered in a heavy vanilla cream, not an Alfredo sauce as described. Also we ran out of water and had to flag down our waitress who still had not checked on us but was rolling silverware at the bar. When I finally got to see her and tell her about my meal, she responded with \"Well my friend loves the scallops.\"I strongly do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just picked up takeout from there for some out of town guests, since we had heard such good things a about the place. Upon getting home the pesto pasta was floating in oil and basically inedible. The bolognasa was very bland and I could have ordered the same quality meal for half the price at a chain restaurant like the Olive Garden. 
Embarrassing  for us and unfortunate for our still hungry guests.... Everyone complained about their meals...."}
{"text":"Cafe Boa is an Ahwatukee gem! Great food, service, and ambiance. The live music on the weekends is great. The Antipasta was fantastic."}
{"text":"Five stars. (updated from my earlier post). The owner contacted me and encouraged me to return. We made a special stop for the butter cake and found it to be perfect. The staff was warm and welcoming. I think that 8.50 is pricey for lunch dessert but the quality and presentation is there, so I will continue to be a happy customer and order the cake. Kudos to the owner for following up with a customer with grace and style. Recommend that you give this Caffe a try. They have marvelous  selections in addition to the cake."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because the food was good, the service, however, was not.  I get a better greeting at McDonald's.  When we entered I felt like I was bothering the hostess.  She also was our server.  I tried to be friendly and asked what she would recommend... very cold.  She spent most of her time talking to her friends at the bar and never came back to see how things were going.  I would expect more from a local family owned restaurant.  We've been here a few times over the years and I've noticed their yelp ratings have dropped.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  My family loved it!  It was a really nice atmosphere.  Our waiter - Miguel - was really great and friendly--willing and able to answer questions.

As far as the food, it was also lovely.  The scallops are amazing here-I would highly recommend them.  The antipasti was a nice platter for sharing.  And yes, the butter cake is pretty good (the fruit made you feel a little less guilty and offset the flavorings).  Ours was cold, I noticed other reviews talked about a warm version.

I would highly recommend it and I will be coming back.  It was really nice to sit on the patio in the evening too and the heaters kept us warm."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Caffe Boa for the second time yesterday. The first time, we were waiting for our to-go sushi order from Sakana next door; so we thought we'd grab an appetizer and a glass of wine while we waited. Thought it was great and the atmosphere was great and figured we'd be coming back often.

Last night was different. The first words that we were greeted with were \"Where do you want to sit?\". Well, hello to you too! When we got to our table we were brought water, but it took about 20 min for someone to come greet us and get our drink order.

From this point, the experience was fine. We had a bottle of wine and the Crostini Boa (which the bread should be toasted). We ordered off of the specials for the night. I ordered the beef medallions and my husband had the filet. He ordered it rare, with specific instructions on how it should look. Our order was brought out and our server went back inside. My husband cut into his filet and it was overcooked; medium actually, and when you order it rare, that's REALLY overcooked. My meal was fine. We waited for the server to come back out to ask us how our meal was... and waited... and waited. After 20 min, he finally came back out and asked how everything was.

My husband is in the restaurant business and is well aware of how this next part should have gone. My husband told the server his steak was overdone (he only had a bite of it) and the server looked at the steak and said \"Yup, that does look overdone. Would you like me to box it up for you?\" What?! He should have said, \"Yes, that does look overdone. I'm sorry about that, let me get you a new one.\" 

When you're paying $40 for a filet entree, and spending almost $200 on a meal and experience, I expect them to get it right, or make it right. We had him box our leftovers and ordered another glass of wine and asked for the check. It was one of very few times that I tipped less than 20%. 

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cafe Boa is a small, classy restaurant tucked away in an unassuming strip mall in Ahwatukee.  They have a rather limited main menu, but typically 4 or 5 daily specials.  I went here on a quiet Monday night with some coworkers and it wasn't busy at all.  The service was prompt and friendly, although they did forget to put our appetizer order through.  I had a Hawaiian sunfish that was stuffed with Asiago cheese over a bed of fresh rice and steamed veggies... It was delicious and a very generous portion.  The waitress brought us a free dessert for the appetizer mix up, so we were very happy that they took care of us.  I will certainly be back to sample more of their specials."}
{"text":"I love this place, but tonight a man at the bar was so loud and cursing! There were 6 tables all looking at wonder as to how could management allow this to happen. I asked the waiter to talk to him, and they made the guy leave! Was able to enjoy my stuffed sunfish and Pinot listening to Sade! Love Caffe Boa"}
{"text":"Over the top ratings but quality of food is nothing spectacular! Run of the mill super XL portions suave is loaded with cheese and a cream based sauce and veggies but not much flavor! And this was their most popular pasta ! Calamari with marinara sauce was ok. Just another Italian restaurant . Not worth going back !"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Caffe Boa last night with the girls.  It had been a while so I thought it was time for an update to the review.  Not surprisingly, it is still a solid 5 stars.  Of the six ladies at the table, every single one of us commented on how good our food was.  I had the spicy rigatoni which I have to say is now my new favorite dish.  The bruschetta was very tasty as always and I was pleased to see they now have a crostini made with brie that was amazing.  Everyone found a wine that was to their liking and that plus the food plus the good weather made for a very relaxing evening on the patio.  I of course had the Strawberry Basil martini and it was delicious as always."}
{"text":"A lovely little spot for a glass of wine, a nosh or a relazing dinner. This little Ahwatukee spot has a great chef, with a dazzling palate. The specials are always very nice. The staff is knowledgable about the wine they serve, the food and preparation methods used by the chef, which is nice to hear when making and selection. And though I'm not always a big fan of asking a multitude of questons before making a selection, it is nice to know the knowledge is there if I asked.  I've always been treated well by the staff and get the impression they know their restaurant well. 

 The wine selection is lovely but I would like to see a few more wines by the glass and more in the range of $7-8 rather than $9-10 on a more consistent basis. They do usually have a nice price for a bottle though and the entrees servings are very generous.  A delightful spot to while away some time and relax with a great wine.Overall, it reminds me a bit of a european bistro, a nice neighborhood restaurant where the staff knows its' patrons well and creates lovely meals."}
{"text":"It's a favorite of mine, my family and many of my friends. In all the years I've been going here I've yet to have a bad experience. Service has always been great and the food, oh the food :) It's one of the few places where I have a hard time deciding what to eat, every dish I've ordered has been great so while I stick with the usual at other places, at Caffe Boa I'm always excited to try something else. If I had to choose a favorite dish or something to recommend to newcomers, it's the pasta dishes, now which one is up to you!"}
{"text":"This update is for the main reason I came here: BUTTER CAKE

I've always loved butter cake because it combines a few of my favorite things besides girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes.

Let's start with the presentation: a slab of sexy butter cake, topped with a strawberry, with chocolate and raspberry sauce drizzled all over the plate, and two blackberries and two raspberries to cover the four corners/directions of the plate.  Splendid!

And then the taste.  Lord almighty - the cake part was as delicate and rich as cheesecake, except...BETTER...and more buttery.  The crust was thick yet smooth, kind of like bread pudding.  Really, it's tough to describe this as nothing can really do this fantastic dessert justice...except by eating it.

{"text":"A little on the high side as far as price but food is good and atmosphere is great. Not really a place for children although we have taken our kids in before. The halibut is excellent as is the steak. This is a good place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the wines! You don't have to drive to Scottsdale to find a great place to dine when it's right across from your house!"}
{"text":"I just don't get this place.  I know some people like it.....and I've given it more than 1 try.....but it's pretty simple -- the food is not that good.  Specifically, the pasta is cooked with a LOT of butter.....and cream sauces, which makes the meal fatty and filling.  In addition, the service is just not good.  We waited.....and waited.  We split a meal and they charged us to do it.

I don't recommend this place....and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Phoenix restaurant.  I am visiting and my friend suggested we eat there.  While the menu is nicely priced, sandwiches make up half of the first page.  In small print it states they are not available after 3 or 4.  Why take up over a fourth of the menu with something that's not available for dinner?  We were there at 6:30, so no sandwich for me.

The \"specials\" which are actually the dinner entrees are listed on a small blackboard on the wall with no prices. I asked about the salmon, and our waiter said \"$23\".  OK...that's more than I want to spend, but there really is NOTHING else that looks appealing to me.  (About 1/2 of the menu is pasta, and I don't eat pasta.). So I order the salmon--sauce on the side.

The salmon comes--HUGE piece--enough for three meals probably.  It is swimming in the sauce.  I asked the waiter for another plate and said \"I meant 'on the side' for the sauce....not on the plate with salmon on top of it.\"  So he brings me another plate.  I eat part of the salmon (which was cooked perfectly, I will add).  Then the bill comes--salmon is $24.95.  I said to waiter Travis \"you told me $23\".  His response was \"I was wrong....I'll fix it on your bill.\"  I said \"forget it.\"   When he brought the change, waiter Travis said \"next time I'll get it right.\"  I said \"there won't be a next time...I don't live here....and I won't be back.\"

Not a good experience as I don't pay $25 for a meal ever--it was way out of my budget."}
{"text":"Oh--nope. No need to go here if you want. There are other things to go to. Flavors are normal. The wine is almost always available. They'll be happy to take your purchase. Go if you need to."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant.  My son took me to lunch one day.  I had the scallops and they were excellent.  A great atmosphere where adults can have a wonderful meal and wine.  I like the location-tucked away.  I would recommend this highly for a nice night out!  They have al fresco dining too!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been there for Mother's Day dinner. Love the patio and the atmosphere.
I had the blackened salmon dish from specials and it easvery good, cooked just right on a rice bed and sautred veggies. The staff is always friendly and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  Very nice, classy place, clean.  Soft jazz playing in the background.  I would recommend this place for a low-key weeknight.  

Service:  No one there to greet at check-in, I believe hostesses were helping clear tables.  Our server stepped up to the plate and provided amazing service.  Went out of his way to make this a great experience. The gentlemen wait staff were very attentive and on their game.  

Food:  It is as described.  Diver Scallops were an amazing size.  The sauce was well seasoned, The pasta al dente.  

I tried my husband's Filet Mignon, it was well prepared and a generous portion.  He did not leave one crumb on his plate.  

I tried my daughter's Bow Tie Boa chicken, it was also very well done and a generous portion.  

Mimosas:  Very well done, the way they should taste. 

Bread and sauce dip:  It is not cottage cheese folks.  I believe it is a fontina or marscapone; some type of Italian cheese mixture.  Different.  The bread, I cannot tell if it was home baked, but it was fresh and soft.  It was not warm when we got it, but rather on the cold side. I am not sure if this is how it was supposed to be but we finished it off. 
 
Overall:  Very nice.  Just a couple of things would send this over the top to a 5 star:  1.)  I felt the wait staff could have used one extra hand this busy Mother's Day and 2.)  My Linguini was cold upon arrival.  3.)  The butter cake is amazing, but with the $8.50 price tag, I felt it could have been a bit more generous in size.  Also the fruits around the side I felt were skimpy, could have used a few more.  

It's a cute little place and rates good."}
{"text":"Ok...I wanted to go someplace different.  We were in a restaurant rut, so I used yelp to just browse some places in the area.  When I saw cafe boa, I realized that I hadn't been there in about 13 years....time to check out the menu.  So I checked out the menu online and I was hooked...couldn't wait to get there.  We walked in and the ambiance was very nice...romantic, but not overly dark.  When we sat down, my husband looked at the menu and said \"what can you eat here?\"...referring to my wheat allergy, but I had seen the menu online so i said..\"oh, just look\" and grabbed the menu.
My heart sank when I saw something completely different than I had seen online.  Where was the Sicilian street corn?  Where was the rakija bar?  And the farro risotto?  And the meat and cheese board?  Well, apparently I had seen the menu fit the Mill Ave location and they were drastically different.
We were here and already seated, so I had to make the best of it..not much in the gluten free arena, but I settled on the Roma salad with chicken.  My daughter had the gnocchi and my husband had the voodoo penne.
WOW...the Roma salad was absolutely delicious.  The tomatoes were perfect...not gooey...really firm.  Large slices of buffalo mozzarella, the chicken was moist, not the standard salad chicken you usually see, and the basil was fresh, all topped with balsamic and some fresh ground pepper...truly wonderful.
My daughter enjoyed the gnocchi.  The sauce want overpowering, and the gnocchi themselves were quite tender instead of the standard thick globs of dough you often get at restaurants.
None of us finished our meals because the portions were generous.
An evening that started out tenuously ended well.
Although there admittedly isn't much on the menu that I can eat, I'll be back because what is there is exceptionally well done.

P.S.  maybe we'll hit the Mill Ave location next week for my birthday to check out what looked like an amazing menu."}
{"text":"This is a small intimate restaurant, where the lighting is dim and music soothing.  Perfect for my postponed Valentine's Day date night.  
I tried this place on Friday night.  Thankfully I had called ahead and made reservations, because it was PACKED!  
The menu is limited but there were also 5-6 meat/seafood specials if you are not a pasta fan.  Try the tiramisu for dessert, you will not be disappointed.
Best part of the night was listening to the solo guitar player, who started at 7pm.

Only downside of the evening was the drunk older women at the table next to mine who kept grabbing the waiters for a hug and then one of them knocked over and shattered her wine glass.  

Overall, the food was good, atmosphere was great (intimate + romantic)."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live so close it's where I go for any eat out occasion- from just because, to date night, to celebrating a career move. I'm fairly certain they absolutely hate me but I don't care! The food is amazing! Eat at Caffe Boa! Also, the Affinity Cabernet is AMAZING and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Boa, took out of town friends to brag on it, yikes, epic fail. They ran out of bread, mixed up our order and the pasta putenesca tasted like tomato sauce with a couple of calmata olives, did not eat it. I'm hoping it was a bad day, going to give it one more try."}
{"text":"I have to say I had one of the best meals in my life here. I ordered the sunfish which was the special of the day. Everything was cooked to perfection. I was totally impressed!"}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant this is ! From the beginning you come in till the moment you leave you feel yourself really as a guest. Being with a big group (14 persons with a small kid) it appears that is not a problem at all.
On a wonderfull   patio you feel good in a fast moment.  The hostess was very kind and patient and had great advices about the food.  Unbelievable how quite it can be on a patio at the Eliot Road. We absolutely. come back an other time."}
{"text":"Cafe Boa is one of our favorite restaurants in Ahwatukee.  The food is always excellent, be sure to try the Bolognese, Voodoo Pasta, or Tenderloin Medallions.  Their nightly specials are superb, try the Sunfish.  Service is terrific.  It's a little crowded, reservations on the weekends."}
{"text":"Still sitting on the fence on this place, BUT the owner sent me a Yelp message and encouraged me to stop by and then do an update on my original review.

Kudos to him for reading Yelp reviews and listening to customers...we'll see what happens on my next visit.

But I give him credit for being involved and listening to yelpers."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Caffe Boa for the past 8 years. I came in for dinner last night and left feeling very disappointed. I want to preface with the service... The service was great and almost always is. We sat at the bar and the guy that served us was great and attentive. My problem was with the beloved bread. The bread and dip that comes with the meal is usually one of my favorite parts of eating there and I feel like it is a staple of dining at an Italian restaurant. Last night when the bread arrived, it was noticeably different. It was dry and stale and definitely not like the bread they usually serve. I asked our server (bartender), if they got new bread and he said \"yes\". It tasted like store-bought bread and was not good at all. I really hope that this is not the beginning of a downward spiral but they really need to do something about it or I guarantee they will begin to lose loyal customers. There are other ways to cut costs but I don't think changing to dry, I assume store-bought bread is the answer. I want to continue loving this place... Please bring your old bread back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here several months ago and we were not pleased with the experience. Our biggest complaints were that we found a rubber band or some foreign object in the food and the service was bad. Someone from my party sent an email to the owner expressing her concerns and never received a response, so here's a Yelp review to say that we won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst experience and food ever!  My family has quite a few food allergies (gluten, dairy, egg, peanuts, etc.), so we called ahead to make sure they had gluten free pasta as advertised on their menu.  So we come with a party of 9 and they seat us outside because they say it's warmer than inside and that they had heat lamps.  They did have heat lamps, but only 1 for our entire table b/c they said they ran out of propane.  When it came time to order, the server told us there was no gluten free pasta.  I expressed my disappointment that we were misled when we called earlier about the gluten free pasta availability, saying that we would never have come there if we knew there was no gluten free pasta. Server apologized profusely and told us that the manager offered to send out some 3 free desserts  - sorbet and crème brulee (creme brulee had gluten of course, so the gluten free eaters could not eat it). Anyways, our party ordered food and it took 1.5+ hours waiting in the cold for all the food to come out.  When it did come out, the lasagna I had was cold in the middle and the rest of the food was overcooked and mushy. 
Whatever my son ate, he had an immediate allergic reaction to the food while at the restaurant. 2+ hours later we left the restaurant having to pay a big bill, cold, hungry and sick.  
I felt bad for the server, she tried to accommodate as best as she could.  The manager, however, never even came out to talk or to apologize for us."}
{"text":"I think my Husband and I came at a bad time for our first visit...We went on a Friday night, when it was packed and there was some big dinner party out on the patio. Being that it was packed on the inside we were kind of left sitting in the corner of the patio with the dinner party. So it was a little a distracting.

I think the restaurant, what little I saw of it, is nice. It's a nice little romantic place, with low lights, and live music. I did see kids there, though, so it can be a good for families, too.

The wait staff was very friendly. Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu, which was helpful as it was our first time there.

The food, then, was really excellent. I had the tortellini brigantino which was very tasty. There was also a nice helping of it so there was plenty to take home and I felt I was getting my money's worth.

In general, it's not a bad place and I certainly can see why people enjoy it, but it just might be awhile before we visit again."}
{"text":"My husband (Tim H.) and I stopped here on our way home from Valentine's Day dinner at Roka Akor for a little dessert. We sat at the bar and while I enjoyed a cappuccino and ordered the tiramisu (one of my favorites) he ordered a port and asked about the butter cake. The bartender (we were seated at the bar) said it was one of their most popular desserts. That still doesn't say if it's good or not but he took a leaf of faith and ordered it. My tiramisu was very average. Trader Joe's frozen tiramisu is much better but the butter cake was so good!  The outside edge was chewy and they inside was gooey. I could go back again and again for it. (I've looked up recipes for it and they all use yellow cake mix. Strange.) I've had some food there and it's hit or miss but that's another story for another time. They've redeemed themselves with their butter cake. Even if you're not a dessert person, you really have to try it when you go there."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Cafe Boa Awatukee.  I came here with a client for lunch and it was a great atmosphere for conversation and food.  The servings are pretty large which I think is great b/c who doesn't like left overs?  (well some people don't but  I don't know you and I bet we wouldn't get along if  I did)

The atmosphere is really simple, airy and enjoyable.  It is in a strip mall with a Gold's gym so it might seem odd that such a great place is hidden in here but it is refreshing. 

I had a fabulous caprese salad."}
{"text":"Three of us that ordered the seasonal sunfish special all agreed it was excellent!  Husband and I split the small Sanora? salad (had figs, apples) and the sunfish and it was a perfect amount.  Our group ordered 4 different desserts (brownie, creme brulee, cannoli, and tiramisu) and the tiramisu was our favorite- one of the best I've ever had! Did not really care for the cannoli."}
{"text":"We went on Mother's Day. We arrived at 1pm. 1pm turn into 2 and still didn't get our food. The kitchen was smoking so bad that they had to open the doors to let the smoke out. We had little kids and elder women with us who couldn't tolerate the smoke. We waited outside because our eyes were burning. We asked the waiter when our food will come out he mentioned to us that they were under staffed and that our food will come out shortly. The manager didn't even come out to apologize to us and the other customers who were also waiting for their food 2+ hours. It was absolutely the most horrible service. We waited 3 hours and still the manager didn't come out to apologize. The least he could have done was to apologize, I understand he was helping out in the kitchen but it's very inconsiderate of him not to try come out !! It literally takes two seconds just to say \"Hey I'm sorry for what happened, here is an appetizer on us while you wait for your food to come\". It didn't try to make the customers happy, so the customers would come back. Sadly, the poor waiter was the only that apologized for the situation. The waitress and waiters were getting all the customers complaints for the fault of the manager. If only he had the decency to come out from hiding in the kitchen. We ended up leaving after the long wait, with no food. We left hungry amongst other customers who got their food late and extremely upset with no apology from the managers side. VERY bad restaurant service. Never experienced something like this before. Doesn't even deserve 1 star!"}
{"text":"Just to clarify: this review is for the Elliot Rd. restaurant in Ahwatukee.
The only way I can make sense of the glowing reviews here is to conclude that those diners don't get out much or they're friends with the owner. They also obviously really appreciate that the staff pays attention to regulars (who wouldn't?).  However, in the past four years, I've eaten here probably a dozen times, and experience was such a let down that months would go by before my husband and I would say, \"Eh, let's give it another shot.\"  Okay, no more.  
Everything about this restaurant is consistently inconsistent.  The service is friendly but inevitably the server screws up our order.  The ingredients seem thoughtfully chosen but the preparation is way off (overcooked, undercooked, something left off of the plate, etc).  One of our dishes may be really good and the other barely okay.  Even the space is confused.  Half of the dining room faces the bar, so diners are forced to deal with whatever game they have the giant TV tuned into.  I don't know about everyone else, but I don't usually pay $75 for a bottle of wine at a sports bar.
Which leads me to the wine.  By the glass? Forget it.  The offerings are no better than what you'd find at a nice pizza joint.  Bottle offerings are pretty unforgettable, too, and I get the sense that the owner is counting on his patrons not realizing that they're paying too much for what they get.  Much of the wine list looks like it's taken straight from the shelves at the local Fry's market.  But why would I want to drink Rex Goliath, Rodney Strong, Bogle or even Lindeman's at a restaurant that bills itself as a \"Euro-style bistro and wine bar\"?
It's true that the dining experiences in Ahwatukee are mostly limited to chain restaurants and modest mom-and-pop joints, so it's nice to see someone trying to up the ante. Now if only Caffe Boa would actually do so... 
One more note: I know there's an ongoing grudge between this restaurant and the Mill Ave. establishment of the same name.  I'm familiar enough with both to say this: the Mill Ave. restaurant far exceeds this one in terms of ambiance, food and wine.  Alas, it is also run by someone notorious for not treating his employees very well.  I've never heard one bad thing about this Caffe Boa's management."}
{"text":"Love Caffe Boa! The food, service and ambiance are impeccable! Family owned and operated businesses are the best! You can always feel it in the air and taste it in the food! My husband and I have been going here for years! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Had a girls' lunch here the other day and was pretty impressed with the food and atmosphere.  I had the Voodoo Penne and it was amazing!!  The bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar dipping sauce was just okay.  I actually think Carrabba's has the best bread and dipping sauce around.  But anyway, we split of bottle of wine that was delicious.  And for dessert, we split the creme brulee and tiramisu.  Wasn't crazy about the creme brulee, but then that's not my type of dessert.  The tiramisu was incredible!

I will definitely return to this restaurant with my hubby for a date night.  Hopefully it will be cool enough to sit on the patio as it looked delightful and romantic."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my experience here. I ordered their bruschetta board, which came with only one slice of each kind--I was expecting a smorgasbord akin to what you would receive at Postino for the same price. (Postino, by the way, offers infinitely better bruschetta.) I'm a tiny woman with a tiny stomach, and still left hungry. What's more, their \"smoked salmon\" bruschetta is actually shredded, cold salmon similar to canned tuna that was so fishy I had to fight back a gag reflex. Because I was still hungry and wanted to get my money's worth, I doused it in someone else's aioli and forced it down. What a bummer...I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Simply awesome! Must try the lasagna and do not forget the fleet butter cake to die for!"}
{"text":"Cafe Boa is more sophisticated than other restaurants in the area and the patio is a welcoming oasis at lunch or dinner.  Unfortunately, they consistently serve stale bread at lunch and numerous times (more often than not) the veggies and pasta I've ordered have been overcooked and soggy.  It's a great neigborhood place to go, especially if you want a little more class than the usual chain restaurant, but the food is definitely not gourmet."}
{"text":"Caffe Boa Ahwatukee is a great spot if you have a taste for simple Italian. The food is good, but not amazing, and the menu is quite large. There are always a ton of daily specials written on the chalkboard, which is located on the wall. Prices can seem a bit high for the quality of the item, but I have never had a bad experience with my food or service. (*hint* they have great wine flights)

The waitstaff has always been friendly and attentive during dinner hours (I have never been during lunch), but if you make a reservation through OpenTable make sure to double check that they checked you in to your reservation. They always forget! 

You can eat both inside or outside, and you can usually get a table on the weekends without a reservation! Although - if they have live music on the night you plan on going, you may want to make one just in case. 

Happy Eating!!"}
