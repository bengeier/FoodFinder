{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in town!  The team is unbelievable and the total experience is unmatched!  I absolutely love the sandwiches and the prepared foods are delicious. Finally, a great place to purchase steak, chicken, chops, etc.  A real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Hands down.........the best BLT I ever ate!!!!!!!!.........in the Italian market of all places"}
{"text":"A very authentic, old style Italian deli which I missed moving here last year from the northeast.  The deli sandwiches are fantastic and their spinach roll is to die for!!  The owner and staff are super friendly and glad to accommodate special requests.  They don't carry baloney or muenster cheese but hey, it's not a perfect world.  Always a really nice experience and customers chat while food is being prepared."}
{"text":"Wow....finally, a place that knows how to make a quality hoagie!!!  The Italian hoagie is perfect, and the basil pesto chicken salad is beyond amazing.  I recommend calling in your order on Saturdays, as it gets really crowded but its well worth it.  Much better than the local competitor, derado's."}
{"text":"Popped in after lunch at Sangam in the same plaza.  Best food and imports south of Jersey!! Great guys-knowledge and sense of humor.  Nostalgia runs high for us  transplanted New Yorker's-Ferrucci's delivers. They had me at Burrata and Boars Head!  Check this place out-reminisce and enjoy-I did!!!"}
{"text":"For those old school deep south people who think that \"Yankees\" aren't as polite or customer centric as they are, this place will make you think twice. Great products, good people, you don't need anything more.   I have been in there a few times but yesterday, I was in just a rotten mood and decided to stop in to grab lunch and something to throw in the oven for dinner. I was completely indecisive and told them i was just having a bad day. A few seconds later, one of the guys comes out with a gob of canoli cream on a spoon and hands it to me. That man knows women =)   The staff was very low pressure and one of the ladies guided me to a premade smoked chicken ravioli dish. I am so glad I took her recommendation. I've eaten quite a few ravioli in my life but this one is in the top 5 of all time. The smoked chicken with the herb laden ricotta really made an impact. It was paired with a red sauce which complemented the ravioli nicely. 45 minutes in the oven and dinner was done.   I have tried their meatballs, chicken Marsala and a few other things there previously and remember that none of them disappointed. Quite the opposite in fact. That day I chose a peperoni roll, a dry aged huntsman style sausage (I wish i got two of those instead of one) a San Pellagrino Aranciata (always a favorite) and a bit of mozzarella marinated with sun dried tomatoes, garlic and herbs... and some ricotta salata.   The mozzarella was super tasty with the sun dried tomatoes, garlic, herbs and olive oil. I am very glad they did not under do the herbs and sundrieds like a lot of places do.. giving it just a bland flavor. The flavors popped and really paired well with the cheese. Ricotta salata is always nice. Its a slightly crumbly cheese that i just end up pinching bits off of and eating with a piece of crusty bread and olive oil. (Who needs a salad to put it on?)   The selection of high end Italian cheeses, pasta, premade dishes and of course the butcher shop make this place a gem. This place had made my \"must stop at when I am in the area\" list."}
{"text":"I just moved to CLT from NYC.  Ferrucci's is an authenic Italian market like the old school Italian markets I would go to in NYC.  To all former NYC/NJ transplants, this place is a must!  They even make homemade italian cheese and parsley ring sausage!"}
{"text":"There is a great little Italian Market located in a strip plaza in Cornelius, NC that will have everything you are looking for. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Fresh sweet or hot sausage, and fresh meats as well. Homemade  meatballs, lasagna rolls, antipasto salad and kalamata olives are  only a few of the items in the full on deli case. Beautiful bread selection.  The inside Wall is lined  with olive oils, lupini beans, sauces, tomatoes, wine and dried pasta. Nice Italian cookies, pizzelles and biscotti and more. Hard to find Italian Nougat candies! They will be for my next visit to Ferrucci's !"}
{"text":"Very friendly and efficient. I could not find anything close to Sfogliatella (my favorite pastry) till I came here and was able to get an entire bag pre-made ready to bake. I'm definitely looking forward to being a regular."}
{"text":"This place is a total rip. The guy who owns it isn't Italian, and claims he flys his desserts ( among other things) in from Italy. Huh????? What am I an idiot? If you believe this guy come see me I got a bridge I want to sell you."}
{"text":"A gem in Cornelius (the only one too). Love this place, almost everything about it is great. Why not five stars then? Well, the bread from Nova's Bakery they use is terrible. We do not know what is so good about that Southend Bakery. The bread is tasteless and looks really strange. They should get their bread from another vendor. My niece makes better bread in her \"Barbie Bake with Me Oven.\" What the Focaccia? We miss this place and there is not much we miss from this area."}
{"text":"Always felt having Ferrucci's in the area was like having a little piece of NY heaven close by. Thank you to Tony and the gang for always having the freshest products around.  From pasta to baked goods. This little location that has everything gives everything in customer service as well.  You just feel like one of the family the minute you walk in.  Don't pass the opportunity to have one of there Panini Sandwiches for the road.  In a word Amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches for lunch and meats to take home for dinner! We had the Italian and the pesto chicken salad on ciabatta."}
{"text":"I seriously love Ferrucci's! It's a 30 min drive from my home but I go every chance I get. Their Italian heros are outstanding! Meatball hero is excellent! Their cannoli's are outstanding too! None of that dried fruit crap in this cannoli.  We've also tried their fresh sausage and pork from their butcher counter. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Having a real Italian Market and Meat Market is a blessing to any neighborhood. Tony and the staff are all great folks.  Whether you are Italian, a fan of Italian food, or just good grub in general, this is the place for you. It is also a meat market carrying a full selection of different meats and chicken. In addition, you will find some excellent heat and serve meals. There is even a small but carefully chosen selection of affordable wines as well.  The prime steak, sausage and peppers, basil pesto chicken salad, meatballs, stuffed pork chops and Garlic, Parmesan, and Prosciutto mashed potatoes ( to die for) will make everyone's taste buds dance with delight.  Lest I forget deserts - black and white cookies (from NY of course), cannoli (made on-site), tiramisu, and cheese cake...  Just say yes and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Legit Italian deli with awesome made to order sandwiches, plenty of pre-made dinner items, and really good looking fresh meat.  My buddy had been telling me about this place for quite some time and I've lived in the area off and on for most of my life.  Why did it take so long for me to try this place?  I knew what I had been missing the second I walked in.  I felt like I had just stumbled into that secret spot in New York that only your real deal Italian friends know about.  You pay for quality, fair prices though.  The steaks may have been a little overpriced but I didn't buy one so who knows.  The sandwich guy is to your right as soon as you walk in.  If they're busy, know what you want or step to the side.  If they aren't, no hurry.  I went with the Italian, I actually got 2.  Spot on. However, that sub bread on my second sandwich got pretty tough quickly.  I should have gotten something on focaccia, maybe the muffaleta.  Judging from the look of the mozzarella, the caprese would have probably been a great choice as well.  The first deli display you see on the right is full of sandwich meats and cheeses.  The second one is full of pre-made stuff that's ready to go.  Salads, chicken parm, and all sorts of amazing looking sides.  Another foot forward and you're at the cash register.  This place is small but there is plenty look at.  I'm surprised they didn't get me for more money.  Bottom line, DON\"T GO BUY SANDWICHES AT FRESH MARKET.  Your robbing yourself of a great opportunity.  They might even cost more over there."}
{"text":"Decent selection of Italian food. Good sausages."}
{"text":"This place is the jam. Great prices, great prepared and market style food shopping. Very friendly and willing to walk you through their wine selections. Veal Chops are solid."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved here from NJ and never thought we'd be able to find a decent Italian deli.  Boy were we ever wrong...not only decent but great!!! My wife is there almost every week stocking up on everything we love, piccata, marsala, rice balls, sausage balls and on and on!! And the broccoli rabe...wow!! Not only is the food and meat in the butcher case wonderful, but she always comes out with a huge smile on her face.  She loves everyone in the store!  Can't give them enough stars!!"}
{"text":"Lovvvvve this place! If I said all the the things I love this review would run far too long. They treat you like family when you walk in and their recipes run nothing short of delectable."}
{"text":"We have an Italian market in Lake Norman! I am thrilled. Staff is friendly and available for questions. Lots of different Italian options here -- frozen pasta, meats, San Marzano tomatoes, and sandwiches. Worth a visit for a delicious lunch or if you have a hankering for something Italian for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is the REAL deal. Family ran and owned, has stuff you won't find but in Italy or New York..killer Italian Hero's!"}
{"text":"***** 4.5 stars *****  I miss this place so much! It is the best Italian shop anywhere near Charlotte, and the only reason it's not a 5 is because it's so tiny, and thus gets REALLY busy on the weekends when everyone comes by to pick up their favorite treats. It can also be very pricey for some item, considering they're uncooked, but you definitely get the best quality meats out there.  They sell everything you can think of, from marinated cuts of all kinds of meat, about 20 different types of a la carte vegetable/side dishes, various pastries, and even homemade gelato! There is also a nice large wall section full of only Italian wines and they do weekly specials with in-store free tastings. I got some of the best steaks I've ever grilled here, and by far the best prosciutto I have ever eaten. The canolis here are also made fresh daily, and are absolutely delicious and LOADED with creme.  There's also a cute little patio area if you want to come by and have a fresh made deli sandwich, but just be warned there are only about 2 tables, so you may not get a seat. Also the hours are short most days, so if you're running late you may want to call ahead and be sure they're still open."}
{"text":"A little piece of Italy in Cornelius. I love this Italian market. My favorite sandwich is the Milano panini: chicken, mozzarella cheese, roasted red peppers and basil. I usually get mixed grilled veggies and they are delish. They were very helpful helping me select different cheeses to pair w/ their different meats for a dinner party."}
{"text":"Favorite stop on way home from work to pick up a quick delicious Italian dinner!  Especially enjoy the spinach and pepperoni rolls!  As well as the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Roast beef is cooked in the store. A+ for the rb sub. Don't get too much else on it. You don't want to drown the flavor of this delicious meat. Also the bread is fresh and tasty. And they sell wine and the owner is friendly. All in all a perfect stop for a sandwich."}
{"text":"There are not enough nice words or expressions for this establishment! People 100% cheerful and nice EVERY TIME, quality of good has had us coming back for every occasion for YEARS, AND the pricing is totally justified. They have items like a little General store for purchase as well and all so unique. We love this place,"}
{"text":"Great Looking!  Charming Italian Market!  They had a bunch of products and brands i have never seen nor heard of!  The Service is MUCH Friendlier than most of the competition!    For the Price this Italian Sub Sandwich was Very good!  Beats all of the Chains!    In case you want the details, here is my deconstruction of this Sandwich:  Bread was good, chewy not to hard, good flavor 3.85 yelp stars  Onion sliced paper thin, PERFECT! I'll ask for more next time!  5 stars  Meats were good close to four stars, may have been overpowered by the Cheese?  Cheese, it may have overpowered the Meat? 3 stars  Dressing good flavor and the amount was about right 3.5 stars  In the last 20 + years I have had only two Sandwiches that beat this one in North Carolina!  One in Concord and one in Cornelius (the other one in Cornelius I did not like the bread as much as here!"}
{"text":"Didn't have duck breast but had scallopini and veal chops. Pricey but hand cut and outstanding! Make the drive from Charlotte and bring a cooler."}
{"text":"I love this place, it really gives off a welcoming family vibe inside, and you can tell the staff prepare the food with care.   Excellent hot/cold sub options for lunch, or prepared foods for dinner.   I feel like if Martin Scorsese lived in Lake Norman, he'd eat at Ferrucci's."}
{"text":"Great little Italian market tucked away in Cornelius! Their Italian sandwich is delicious! They also have a great pepperoni roll as well, we frequent this place pretty often!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian Deli!  Everything you need to make an amazing Italian dinner or just stop in for a sandwich for lunch.  The butcher even offers cooking instruction if needed.  Highly recommend Italian food lovers check it out!"}
{"text":"So glad I made it out here. It's off the beaten path for most Charlotteans but totally worth the trip!! Ferrucci's is a real live Italian deli! It serves as a market place too with some of the most incredible looking steaks, stuffed pork chops and Braccioli!!!  For my first visit, I ordered both the Muffaletta and Caprese sandwiches; they were just amazing!! The Caprese is a nice simple sandwich with Prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and chopped marinated fresh tomatoes. The Muffaletta was loaded with an assortment of primo quality meats - Mortadella (with Pistachios),Sopressata, Provolone and Olive Spread.  Of course I had to have one of their NY Style Black and White Cookies and my large Cannoli was hand filled to order in front of me!! Both just outstanding!  And...if you've never had a San Pellegrino Blood Orange soda, you've been missing out!  Let's just say, if I lived near here, I would haunt this place!!  PS- D-9 and Ass Clown Brewing are nearby, so make it a day trip!!!"}
{"text":"All kinds of yes! This place had everything I wanted and more. I am so glad I stopped in for a quick sandwich.   They have bread, oils, gravy, spices, premade meats, and a wide array of pastas and salads.   Everyone in there was so friendly. The cashier lady literally made my day because she reminded me of my aunts.   This place has quickly become one of my favorites in the area. They get this Italian girl's approval."}
{"text":"A taste of home for this girl who grew up dipping fresh italian bread in the almost-always-present-and-simmering pot of homemade sauce. Their sandwiches are the best but arrive early or you may not get the roll you want. Prepared insalatas are flavorful and encourage gluttony. Desserts are delicious. Stop by and prepare to eat!  Note: No regular seating- just the odd chair or small table on sidewalk as weather permits."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner. I bought the special, penne sausage,  it was amazing!!! We have 4 boys so we don't make it out often, this is restaurant quality. I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't legit. I've been in there several times and they give me the exact.same.spiel. I'm Italian. You don't have to try hard to convince me you are by all of the intense rhetoric when I come in. Real Italian stores would carry buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto de Parma. They would also carry Parmesan Reggiano. No questions asked. This is a franchise opportunity store, not a mom and pop store. If you want fresh pasta, fresh sauces and higher quality from a real store, try Pasta and Provisions. It's in South Charlotte but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We moved from Upstate NY where Italian restaurants/delis are plentiful to Lake Norman area where it's hard to find good Italian food or desserts. This is a hidden gem! The chicken Parmesan sub was amazing. Sub roll was awesome. They have a deli counter with by the pound deliciousness. I had a serving of the beet salad. We got a cannoli which is made on the spot. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great!!!  When I walked in I thought I was back in New York.  The place has a lot of things that the Italian cooker needs.  I will be back and back again.  Even has to go orders for a dinner for two night."}
{"text":"Very nice little market. Staff is helpful and very polite. I had the Italian sub and loved it.  I'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"First time I was in here was completely by mistake. My phone checked in after I had looked up something else and then I HAD TO go to the place and see where I supposedly \"was\". After a little drive-and-go-peek I found it in a shopping center west of exit 28...  Like any good deli it's a homey little place that smells all food-ey with meats, cheese, more meat, spices, breads, herbs, cheese, and all like that. Pretty sure they can make just about anything worth eating or get you set up so you can pretend you made it yourself; the cases are full of ready to plate entrées, sides, and deserts. Natch it's kind of a nice place and it's got some atmosphere but when the novelty of paying $9 for a $7 sandwich wears off it gets a little too New York for me."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place! Subs are great, and priced great too!  We are repeat customers now!"}
{"text":"Great place with everything you need to make a great dish. Came by to grab a few things for dinner and ended up leaving with a ton of stuff. Pancetta house made sausage good quality local meets and cheeses. Great place to grab quality ingredients"}
{"text":"Well, I had wanted to have a special family outing and so I brought my whole family here to have subs. But when we walked in the door around 5:30, they immediately told us they were out of bread for subs. My daughter saw several sub loaves right on the counter so I don't think that was true. It was more true that they didn't want to bother because they were closing at 6. So we all ordered something pre-made. The customer service was very poor from start to finish and it was very expensive. The food was good, just very pricey. I left feeling very disappointed."}
{"text":"Right now, I wish I were pregnant so I'd have a legitimate excuse to sit in this place and eat literally everything they have to offer. Instead, I had to make due with the Muffaletta. And by make due I mean feel as though every moment of eating it was taking me closer to enlightenment. This sandwich is an inch thick stack of thinly sliced, deliciously fresh cured Italian meats and cheese and fresh olive tapenade between crusty, yeasty ciabatta bread. It's about the size of a week old puppy and I ate THE WHOLE THING. Without even a hint of remorse. This life-altering sandwich I washed down with a Pompelo San Pellegrino (the best flavor) and then capped off the meal with the best cannoli I've ever had in my life.  We enjoyed our meal at one of their sweet little outdoor bistro tables.   If I had infinite time or stomach space, I'd had tried all the other subs, pasta salads, antipasti, lasagna, meatballs, wine, etc that they offered. Plus, the owner and his people were super friendly and funny. All around awesome spot for lunch or dinner to go or to get the makings of an authentic Italian meal at home."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of ready to eat Italian foods and unique ingredients.  I recommend the chicken pesto sausage and the meatball sub is delicious!"}
{"text":"I just moved down to Huntersville NC and couldn't find a good Italian deli until I found this place. So many people told me to go, so I finally did. What a fantastic place. The butcher had all kinds of cuts! The deli meats and cheeses were outstanding! If you go, don't forget to buy \"Little Gina's\" pizzelles!   I just might be going back tomorrow for other items. My husband was pleasantly surprised what I brought home."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte from Brooklyn about a month &1/2 ago from Brooklyn.. It was a pleasure to walk into Ferrucci's . the smells were delish! just like the food!! the staff was frienly..  Tony was great to chat with about the old neighborhood! and NYC.  cant wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good about this place! Everything that I have tried so far has been delicious. The broccoli rabe sausages are amazing and freshly made there. The tiramisu is one of the best I have ever had. The staff is knowledgable and friendly! I look forward to trying more of their delicious options! To me it is worth the drive from Charlotte to them for the fresh meats and deli counter options."}
{"text":"Wow, I felt like I was back in Brooklyn for a minute or two. Great selection of better pastas and did I see goat cheese ravioli? I will have to try that next time. They ha many of the Italian specialty things I search for. Some nice lunch sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"Look, this place is cute and the fresh meat was nice. As for being italian... They sell boars head meat, the same you get at Harris Teeter. Ok, maybe their prosciutto is from Italy but not much else. When I asked why the rest of the Italian style meats weren't they told me they couldn't get them. Hmmm, I know Italian markets all over the US who wouldn't sell Boars Head meat and have full deli cases full of imported italian meats. Nothing wrong with Boars Head but let's not pretend it's anything special or certainly not unique.   So I endorse this place for a cute place, but don't look for too much Italy here..."}
{"text":"I generally give every business a fair shake and realize everyone has a bad day but don't waste your money here. I ordered a meatball parm sandwich and what I got was an embarrassment, there was almost no cheese and the meatballs were sliced what seemed to be in quarters but length wise and then laid on the bread, there was almost nothing on this sandwich other than bread! The worst part is it's a $9.00 sandwich, if it was $5 or $6 I would understand and if I worked closer I would have brought it right back. I will say the flavor was ok at best. If you served people sandwiches like this for $9 anywhere in the northeast you wouldn't be in business for long. Either lower your prices for your mediocre sandwiches or up your game to justify the price."}
{"text":"We stopped in here over the weekend to check the place out and see what they had. The minute I walked in I was immediately transported back to Long Island as the familiar smells of an Italian butcher shop filled my nose. It's a pretty small place, and a good chunk of it is devoted to fresh meats of all kinds, from raw meats like beef to prepared meats like pepperoni. They also sell fresh bread and other Italian imported dry goods. Ferrucci's is definitely a butcher shop first, and their desserts are very limited and nothing compared to what Derado's offers. Though on the other hand, Derado's is more a bakery first and they can't compare with the meats and other entree foods that Ferrucci's has. The staff seemed extremely friendly and talkative (a common trait of any decent Italian specialty shop) as they bantered with the regulars in the crowd and the first-timers like us.  We took home a loaf of bread and a black and white cookie. The bread was better than Derado's, yet still didn't compare to the bread we used to get back in New York. I really do think it has something to do with the difference in water. The black and white cookie was pretty good. The cookie part itself was just right, where it was more \"cakey\" than cookie yet wasn't so dry. However, I did find the vanilla half to be a bit strong on the pure sugar taste where it totally eliminated any hint of vanilla.  I'd definitely be up to coming back again if I needed some Italian meats, cheeses or bread for a super-special occasion, and I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"I kind of forget about Ferrucci's since it's tucked away back off I-77 exit 28 in the Shops on the Green complex.  But when I remember them, I'm always glad I did.    That goes for pretty much everything they offer.  Their selections of meats, cheeses, prepared Italian dishes, salads, etc. is first rate.  What's also good is their sandwich menu.  A nice selection made with fresh ingredients and served on at least serviceable bread.  Making my stomach growl just thinking about it but alas, they are closed on Sunday.  They also offer a good selection of Italian specialty canned, jarred items.  I like that you can get prime beef here.  All their meats are pretty pricey by the pound but I've never not been satisfied once I got it home and cooked it up.  A friendly staff though not as outgoing and boisterous as the crew at Derado's."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time, until we found Derado's.  The service and quality, and prices are SO much better!!!  Go to Derado's and see for yourself!!!"}
