{"text":"I stopped in for the first time for lunch this past week. The food was excellent, and the service was too! I would absolutely recommend this place to all of my co-workers. 

My only gripe about this place is the open kitchen. I think its a wonderful idea, but the kitchen workers should really mind their language and attitudes. There really isn't anything worse than waiting for your food and watching the frustration and listening to the profanities coming from the kitchen. Its also hard to watch as the servers get yelled at. I'm sure there's good reason, but the whole restaurant doesn't need to know. 

Overall, a three-star experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great service, portions, prices, quality, the whole package.  Get the Mac and cheese and you will be happy.    Our server, Tristen, rocks!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed at all of the positive reviews.  Had lunch here and although I have to admit it was cheap, the salad I had was pathetic - pale lettuce, packaged dressing and a stale roll - all of it tasting like it came out of a box.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good drinks and even better atmosphere. This is a great new spot downtown. We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner. It's more of a bar feel - kinda loud. Not a big deal if you don't mind. 

 We ordered some super delicious soup and sandwiches. They tasted so fresh! But the beef brisket tacos are where it's at. 3 come as an appetizer. So scrumptious, could have eaten so many more!! 

Service was great. Beer options were good. We'd come again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my friend, Harley, on our way to the Pens game. We just wanted a quick drink and bite to eat. Our server, Jasmine, was so friendly and could tell that we needed quick service. I ordered french fries (they were a little soggy, but still good) and Harley ordered the mac and cheese bites which were delicious. Yes. I can't wait to go back here to have a real meal! The menu looks extensive and delicious. The atmosphere is nice too - real wood, dark accents, good lights. The crowd is a mix of students and business types, so the buzz is quality."}
{"text":"Came to this place for a cup of soup and a burger. Liked the atmosphere in this restaurant. Great people who passed by to make a little chat. Prices were low given the products they offered."}
{"text":"Garlic Parm Fries are fantastic!  Had the 4 beer sampler, all local breweries and all excellent.  Owner/bartender was super friendly...will go back."}
{"text":"Hey, they may have had a bumpy start due to some technical issues but they have more than made up for it. Excellent service, super friendly staff and excellent food. Even the owner stopped by just to be sure everything was meeting my expectations. I will be back and I will spread the good word."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch.  It was pretty busy, and they haven't been opened for very long.

First, the interior is very nice, modern, upmarket and if you remember \"Osteria 100\" it is located in the same space.  Much of the interior has remained the same, including the small bar located on the left hand side of the restaurant as you enter.

The prices are fantastic!  A BLT for $5.25 with chips.  Most sandwiches $5 to $10.  1/2 pound bacon cheeseburger with french fries for $9.25.  The majority of the lunch menu is under $10.

I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was pretty good.  Seasoned properly, nice toasted bun, good cheese, tasty bacon, and really no complaints at all.  The french fries were crispy and good.

The service was fantastic, really friendly and efficient.  The food was delivered very quickly given how busy the restaurant was.

While I think the food quality is probably 4-star, the value really puts this place over the top.  You can get a solid sit-down meal in nice surroundings for about $10 + tax + tip.  That's pretty solid.

The meal was cheaper than some of my deli to-go meals that have considerably less overhead!

This is a great place to take your co-workers, including those who don't want to spend $20 on lunch on the more expensive places in nearby Market Square!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious with TONS to choose from (the pub pretzels are my favorite), great beer selection on tap, and the atmosphere is very laid back and comfortable. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times already with co-workers, and once with my wife and kid.  This is a nice clean and modern place.  The staff were friendly.  The prices are very reasonable and the home made potato chips are excellent.  We did experience a wait  on a few occasions, but it was right after they opened and they seem to have worked the kinks out now.  This is a great lunch spot for downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I sure wish this place was still open I just found out it was closed when we tried to go there again. It must be the unreasonable rules of the University"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Convenient location, great food, family owned, and quality consistent!! Have been back here quite a few times and always a pleasure!! Love bartender Gretchen, hilarious!!! I recommend  the pizzas and the sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding staff, beers, food. Please don't tell friends though, the wife and I really enjoy the relaxed environment, not too crowded. Shhhhhhhhh....."}
{"text":"Shrimp & corn chowder soup was really good. We had the zucchini planks served with marinara sauce. Very tasty!! Pizza was huge, basic but very good. The trifecta sandwich was fresh, delicious and exactly as described. The bacon and cheddar burger was enjoyable. Chips are homemade (yum) and tasty. Fries were ok. Of all the choices we had, the zucchini planks were five star!!! Good working lunch atmosphere. Small beer bar for after work. Kitchen in view...can watch the other foods go by. Good find!"}
{"text":"This was my first time getting food here.  I didn't get to hang out and explore the space this time, but it definitely has a neat feel to it.  We got the chili and a basket of French fries.  The chili was not that great - super salty and some odd flavor of cheese, but it was super thick and hearty which is always good and almost made up for it.  I won't get it again.  The French fries, though, were fantastic.  I will be coming here just for them if nothing else!  As a major French fry connoisseur, this will definitely be my go-to spot for them now!"}
{"text":"Prices are very reasonable and there is a great beer list.

Service was very good, and our food came quickly.  This is a good choice for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"My first time eating lunch here and I must say it was pretty average. The service was very prompt and the food came really fast. I ordered an American burger (pretty basic) and fresh cut fries. The burger was not seasoned at all. I did ask that my burger was well done and there was no pink so that was a plus. The fries had minimal salt and were semi-crispy. The atmosphere was awesome with the medium lighting and wooden tables and chairs. I would come back and try something else but I wouldn't come back for the American burger."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment for an early dinner before a lecture at the Art Institute. I was seated quickly and the service was above average. 

I ordered the broccoli cheese soup and the smuggler sandwich. Both were very good. The homemade chips are well seasoned and one of my favorites. 

The price of dinner was surprisingly low and I assume this is to attract the college crowd on campus. Definitely worth the visit in the future."}
{"text":"Been walking past here for months waiting for the opening. Finally came in for lunch and ordered the Skinny Dip sandwich. Excellent food, good beer selection and super friendly staff.  Definitely two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is nice and its a great addition to downtown.

i stopped in today for lunch. I walked in, took a look at the menu, ordered and received my food in a great about of time. While waiting, i sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and offered my water while i waited for my order.

The menu has alot of options and it's reasonably priced. They have a a few choices for mac & cheese and every day there is a specialty mac & cheese made (today was Cajun. My boss tried the buffalo chicken and said it was great)

I couldnt decide between the buffalo chicken wrap or a bbq chicken panini. Oh, they have like 3-4 different types of wraps you can choose from. Awesome; I went with the panini. I probably wouldnt order that again. Not enough BBQ sauce and overall I bet the menu had better options. 

While waiting, I noticed salads enjoyed by other patrons. They looked great.

I'll be back and I'm excited to bring Bobby. I bet he would love it here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in Pittsburgh seems to be closed for good. There's a sign in the window thanking customers for their patronage. Great food and service, and it always seemed busy. I wonder if they had a lease issue. But in any case, it's a loss to the restaurant scene."}
{"text":"This was the place in the old PPG cafeteria. (Whatever happened there?). The food is the same with the some of the staff at the old place. I went with a friend right around 12:30 and the place was pretty packed. We got sat immediately when someone left.

The decor is nice. Very contemporary. They have a bar and the kitchen is exposed. There are plenty of tables and even a bar.

I got the bacon cheese burger. It was cooked excellent and the brioche bun was super buttery. The fries were only okay. I should've gotten the chips. They were overdone and not salted. I added my own but nothing tastes as good as salting it as soon as it leaves the frier. It could've been that it was an old batch but fries are one of the easiest things to make so I don't know why that could be messed up.

My friend got the BBQ chicken wrap. It was also okay. Nothing too cray! Just average. It could've used something to spruce it up. Maybe more ingredients.

Overall I'd recommend for a good quick lunch place. Our food came out literally within 5 minutes after we ordered which was awesome.

There are plenty of new lunch and dinner places and this is one you can't miss. I wish they would be a little more aggressive with the menu, but you can't complain about good old hardy deli food."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Hundred Wood will be closing 5/20/16.  BOO!

Had the best French Dip sandwich I ever ate here.  Called the Skinny Dip, I was three bites in before my tastebuds forced me to sit back and examine what I was eating.  That simple-looking sliced beef sandwich and it's ordinary-looking au jus was phenomenal!  The bread was toasted just right, the beef was fresh, tender and seasoned *just so* and the au jus was dark, rich, thin, salty and aggressively beefy.  Perfect with the undersalted house chips.  

Really good!"}
{"text":"Checked out Hundred Wood for lunch and ordered the brisket tacos off the appetizer menu as my meal.  It comes with 3 hearty sized tacos - I could only eat 2 so should be more than enough for a meal.  

The waitress mentioned that they smoke their own brisket and recommend this dish (I was contemplating between this and the turkey reuben).  I didn't think the meat was that great - it wasn't melt in your mouth type of meat but rather stringy and fatty.  It had a slight hint of a smokey flavor but I asked for a side of bbq sauce because I thought it tasted somewhat bland.

Coleslaw and a bbq drizzled topped the tacos and the coleslaw tasted quite fresh and wasn't drenched in that mayo sauce.  

If I go back, I'll try another sandwich.  I tried some of the chips (which my friend wasn't a fan of) but I thought they were tasty - seasoned well and crispy."}
{"text":"04/02/16 UPDATE: Brittany waited on us as usual, she was wonderful. Always accommodates my mom, son and I at lunch time no matter how busy it is. She always brings him a cracker to hold him over until the food gets there.. She is easily the best waitress in the building.

That being said, there was a girl who was definitely new since the last time we'd been in and she was a MESS. She was storming around the restaurant during our entire meal and dropped a loud \"F bomb\" in front of my family and other customers when she dropped her checks. Somebody seriously needs to remind her that people like me consider Hundred Wood an awesome place for families and she is putting that in jeopardy with her foul mouth.

----------


Hundred wood is one of my favorite lunch spots. Burgers are yummy, pizza is average. Fries are better than chips because the chips are bagged and are usually cold. Pretzels with honey mustard is a must have appetizer.

Brittany (I think that's her name) is our favorite waitress. She keeps our drinks full and the last time we were there she really accommodated my son (high chair/crackers).. She's the best and keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere and attentive server. Prices are very resonate for quality of food. 

Five cheese pizza with pine nuts was delicious. Just the right ambient of pine nuts. 

Balsamic vinaigrette dressing was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent service and inexpensive. Pub pretzels are good. Brisket tacos smoked in house is my favorite. Can't go wrong with this place. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is an update after having made a return visit to Hundred Wood for lunch today. I was a little underwhelmed in my last review having stated, \"Although everything I had was tasty, it all just seemed to come up short.\" I also wrote, \"I'll have to stop back again sometime and try something else to see if I can up this rating.\" Well today I did \"try something else\" and I can now \"up this rating.\"

I had a seat at the bar and was immediately greeted with a cheerful, \"Can I get you something to drink?\" I requested an ice tea and it was in front of me within a minute. After glancing at the menu I went for the Trifecta. The sandwich arrived in about five minutes. It contained a generous portion of roast beef, pastrami and roasted turkey topped with a slice of smoked provolone, some coleslaw and Russian dressing all between two slices of toasted rye with a pickle spear and a bag of chips on the side. At first I was a bit surprised that the meats were cold but then I decided it worked really well that way. The sandwich was super delicious!

Other things to note about Hundred Wood is that the service is exceptional, the bar is stocked with a variety of craft beers (always a bonus in my book) and the place on a whole is so noticeably clean. When I combine all those factors with the deliciousness of the sandwich that I had today, I can't help but up my rating to a solid five star. Nice job Hundred Wood!"}
{"text":"Great bar with super attentive bartender. Had the homemade chili as well as the bacon cheeseburger. Everything was cooked perfect and prices were reasonable. Had several local beers on tap which was great for an out of towner. Only been open a year according to the owner but I see a long run ahead for this establishment."}
{"text":"I went here with a bunch of friends from school. We were all on a budget so were very appreciative of the awesome prices! The decor is super chic and urban. As a group, we ordered the mac and cheese bites as well as the pub pretzels. The mac n cheese bites were delicious, and the pub pretzels, holy cow! With the honey mustard, they are incredible. I ordered the five cheese pizza. It wasn't so great unfortunately, but I tasted some of my friends dishes which were all pretty good. The homemade chips are also super good. For dessert, they had a turtle brownie that we split that was quite good as well. The service was amazing-our server was happy and helpful, more than happy to write up 5 separate checks and even split our appetizers and dessert between them all. We really had a great time and will return!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to grab a bite in the city but don't want to spend $40 this is definitely the place for you. My girlfriend and I stopped in one evening and were impressed and overwhelmed by the extensive menu. The menu was speckled with wonderful bargains ($7.75 for half a sandwich and a cup of soup  can't be beat.) I ordered the Upper Deck BLT and it came out with a generous wax bag of fresh potato chips.

 The sandwich itself was served on golden brown toast in four slices and stacked high with crispy lettuce, juicy tomatoes, and of course bacon. And suddenly the irresistible scent of Macaroni and cheese wafted into my nose. I couldn't help myself, and next thing I know I'm ordering some more food. I was so glad that I did! the rich, creamy cheese was generously spread throughout the perfectly al dente macaroni shells! 

If you are looking for good food, at a really good price this is the place for you. Check before you go if they are open, I'm not sure why but sometimes they have been closed at really weird times. Perhaps if Point Park is on break they have shortened hours, but I don't know for sure."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! I had the lobster bisque and my coworkers had a variety of sandwiches. It is definitely very affordable! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The place wasn't too crowded. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and clean with it just opening recently. 

I got the atomizer sandwich was close to $9. It took them close to 45 minutes to make the sandwich. The sandwich itself was average at best with pretty basic ingredients. I think that $9 for a basic roast beef sandwich is a bit steep too.  The waitress had no idea what any of us had ordered when she brought the food out (I ended up getting charged for a Reuben). The bright spot of the lunch were the potato chips. The chips were excellent with a subtle ranch seasoning. The whole lunch experience took almost an hour and a half.

I probably won't be coming back."}
