{"text":"A great addition to the neighborhood! The owners & staff are very friendly and the cafe is comfortable and inviting. There are lots of cool details throughout the place, like the use of reclaimed wood & local artwork. Tried a few drinks -- the black chai tea was delicious and the cafe mocha was a treat. Will have to try the nitro cold brew next time. Really enjoyed the brown bread and scones as well! Looking forward to going back soon. Thanks, 5 Points!"}
{"text":"Delightful neighborhood coffee tea and breakfast shop. They offer soy , almond, skim milk, and others. Coffee is strong and delicious even when decaffeinated! The offerings today were :
Irish bread , scones, shepherds pie, breakfast pie assorted cookies , and yogurt parfaits."}
{"text":"A new local coffee shop with a very loving \"Westpark\" feel. Highly recommended for working or meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"I love that this place is right down the street from me! I tried it for the first time today, and the Cold Brew was excellent! I cannot wait to go back and try the other flavors, and sit outside! They did a great job with the place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite and coffee and I'm so happy I found this place! It was a small shop on the corner and not a ton of seating inside, but the coffee and croissant were worth it. I tried the almond butter vegan croissant and holy vegan was that amazing. It was flaky and buttery and had a delicious almond flavor, I would go back just for that. I also tried their cold brew with almond milk and I was so impressed! Most places have overly bitter and/or strong cold brews but this had such a mellow and slightly smoky flavor that was unique, smooth, and refreshing. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some coffee in the neighborhood of Fairview hospital, and discovered 5 Points, which recently opened. This cafe is a little off the beaten path and you probably wouldn't know it was there unless you were looking for it.

They offer the classic spread of coffee beverages from fresh brewed coffee to espresso and cappuccino and they also have \"nitro\" cold brew (not sure if this is nitro coffee or just cold brew though). They also sell some baked goods such as croissants. The website mentions the Irish roots of the cafe, which is also noted by the Irish music playing inside.

I ordered a cappuccino, which was $3.50. While it was a good cappuccino, I was kind of hoping there would be something unique about it, maybe some Irish flair to it or special Irish latte art in the foam!  

Concerning parking: there is street parking only, though it is easy to find a spot because the cafe is in a very residential area.

In summary: 5 points is a cute cafe that has a lot of promise. I think if they do something more to make their coffee unique, they would become an exceptional coffee shop."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Coffee was really good and not acidic or bitter at all. The staff was friendly. I would recommend you try it out and will be back."}
{"text":"I was driving down Lorain last Friday and saw a little sign on the corner of 159th pointing into the neighborhood saying \"local coffee this way.\" Since it looked like a residential street, my first thought was that this had to be a trap. Tempt me with good coffee and sure! I'll come into your creepy basement. 

Fortunately for all of us, there's nothing creepy about this awesome corner spot right at the 5 points intersection (hence the name). Street parking was both ample and close by, so don't let that scare you off. Friendly staff, great patio, good prices, and my iced espresso was delicious. I can't speak to any of the food since I didn't try it, but everything looked great. Since moving across the border from Lakewood into Westpark, I've been hoping for a place like this in the neighborhood and they did not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem in Kamm's Corners. True Irish tea (natch) served by a friendly staff in a great environment. Great live acoustic guitar on a slow Saturday, or some sun on the patio if you're not feeling the tunes. All the coffee drinks you'd expect plus hot chocolate for the wee ones. Last but not least a wide array of bakery items - scones, cookies, croissants, and a vegan sausage roll that's almost too good to be true."}
{"text":"Great coffee, even better help.

I just moved to West Park and wanted to find my \"local\" coffee shop. I found it. This place is small with nothing but charm.

The ivy covered facade makes it even more charming. You can tell the employees and owners really love what they do. They hold classes (yoga, workshops) within the space as well which I think is a great addition to the neighborhood. The shop has a \"COME TOGETHER\" atmosphere you just can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious black chai tea! I will be coming back for this especially because of the super friendly staff. Oh! Nice scones too!"}
{"text":"Great that our neighborhood has a local coffee shop. Delicious coffee and baked goods. Workers personalities are less than to be desired most times... Overall, great place to go!"}
{"text":"When Five Points Coffee popped up this summer, I was so happy!  A coffee shop right down the street was a dream. 

Their coffee is reasonably priced, the interior is lovely and the mocha is so delicious. 

I don't get down there enough as I would like, but it's great to know that awesome coffee is so close! 

I hope this shop has a chance to thrive. The building on the corner had been vacant for so long. I hope 5 Points has the luck of the Irish on their side!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for a quick meeting. Had the large pot of Irish tea for TWO DOLLARS. C'mon the price alone thrilled me. The tea was just as I expected a pot of Irish tea to be - comforting and consistently good from the first cup to the last. The space is really light and airy, and the staff makes you feel welcome. I'll return again and try some bread or a sausage roll and post an update."}
{"text":"A great coffee shop in the neighborhood!

I was super excited to hear that a new coffee shop had opened into the neighborhood we just moved into- the Kamms corner/West Park neighborhood just is a great community, and it's great to see businesses like these open up!

It's a small coffee shop which brews their blend, made by Phoenix. There's no fancy pourovers/aeropresses, however, they do have a nitro cold brew, which still puts it on the level of being hipster. The coffee is good (even though they don't roast the beans there, it's still good coffee), and the tea selection is great. It's also priced pretty cheap, so that's an added bonus (well, compared to the other hipster coffee shops).

There's also a wide selection of pastries. We had the breakfast pie as well as a chocolate croissant- both were great. 

As an added plus, there's wifi and even a changing table in the bathroom. On a nice day too, there's seating outside, so that's an added plus.

If you're in the West Park neighborhood and need a solid cup of coffee, stop on over to 5 Points- it'll definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! I will definitely be back! The grand opening was yesterday, and they had some kinks to work out still, like they were out of a lot of things. I got an iced latte and it was perfect. The line was out the door! I couldn't believe it! Very nice patio as well!"}
{"text":"This little coffee shop bills itself as an Irish place. It's been open just about two months now and is located on the corner of a residential street. 

There seemed to be parking in front and across the street in front of another business, but I do have to feel bad for the homes in this area. They surely get a high number of driveway turn arounds - I did it. 

Two cheerful girls staffed the coffee bar. I ordered a Macchiato which they serve properly at a 1:1 ratio. The staff asked me though if I preferred a bit more foam. 

I love Shephard's Pies so I couldn't pass up the one I saw in the counter. It was a small circle of thin dough, but stuffed with all the right stuff - meat, potatoes, peas and carrots. The barista heated it up for a minute. For such a small thing just sat in a bakery case among the scones and cookies it really was good!"}
