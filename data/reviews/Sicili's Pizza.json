{"text":"OH My I am a long way from home and wanted some good food delivered.  So I found this place and I know there are  mixed reviews.  I have to say I am giving it 5 stars. 
1st they delivered.  2. My order was hot fresh and correct 3. The service was great.  I was called baby and told I love you as part of the service but it was not in an inappropriate way. LOL  He was really funny.  I ordered a variety of things so I could see what I liked and everything was really good.  The  pizza was not the best in the world but it was good.  The chicken strips and fries were off the chain and went well with the A&W rootbeer!  I am so glad I found this place an will be eating again before I leave.  Thanks guys.  The delivery driver was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Food was delicious had the meatball sub was so juicy and cheesy. The Greek salad was huge I couldn't eat half of it. It was great and service was good. Now the delivery guy did insist that i tip him because that is what I put on the credit card."}
{"text":"Off the strip. Super cheap option for Vegas. Have daily specials. Great customer service. Bountiful parking. Pizza is similar to a new York style. Pasta had similar flavor as fazzoli. The locals hang out outside the joint. Don't be surprised if you're approached by a lady of the night."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town the pizza in the casino didn't taste good at all there's taste better than the pizza in the casino and they deliver which was cool"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service!!!
I had the Hawaiian and it was the best I've had in a while and  the sauce was delicious.i absolutely love this place and their lunch specials :)"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the lack of reviews, the pizza here is well made, and matches up or exceeds the major pizza franchises. My buddies and I felt like having a lazy day at the hotel room in Vegas, and wanted to get some simple delivery. Who knew it would be so difficult to find establishments willing to deliver directly to the room! The fact that this spot delivers straight to your room is a major plus and very convenient. We got the Sicily supreme pizza, plenty of toppings, and the food was still warm. Definitely appreciated the friendly service over the phone as well.  For those lazy afternoons in after a rough Saturday night in Vegas, I recommend checking this joint out."}
{"text":"I would definitely give them 3 1/2 stars . I ordered some spagetti with meatballs and antipasto for delivery . Very polite on the phone and food came within the time frame that was stated. The spagetti was really good and tasted fresh as if they made the pasta themselves. The antipasto was good, didn't have any cheese on it (which I am used to getting on a antipasto) but overall the food and service is definitely worth a return visit ."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza! Yuri was a blast to talk to. If you like free entertainment, the people outside the shop provide plenty. Not in the safest neighborhood, but worth the risk if you want some good quality pizza. Go for lunch, not dinner."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna go ahead and say that if you haven't ordered from here yet, you are missing out on some BOMB pizza, and the price makes it just that much better. I was able to get two 18\" pizza's for $25, and man I know where I am coming too for my pizza needs."}
{"text":"Garlic butter pizza. Love it! Tasty pizzas  and great costumer service.  
I fall in love with yury,  so I will have to ho back soon!!"}
{"text":"Flew into Vegas last weekend and didn't get into my hotel room until late. I was famished and not wanting to walk around searching for food at 11pm, so I searched online and found Sicili's. I ordered online, got a call shortly after, met the delivery guy in my hotel lobby, and was eating delicious food before I knew it! Got the pizza with garlic butter, tomatoes, red onions, chicken, and white sauce along with a ceasar's salad. Everything was really good, even as leftovers the next day!!"}
{"text":"I love this place..my first time having it was today and i got the garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs, Caesar salad..wonderful food.. There will be a secomd and third time for me!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall place just off the strip. I ordered on the Yelp app. and it was flawless. Give them a little extra time to make the order. Pizza is good and I got an great salad too. I will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas. 

Yuri is a one man show. If he doesn't pick up the first time it's cause he's manning an oven, grill, and  greeting customers at the same time. So, give him a second call you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and friendly staff. I accidentally missed the delivery guy when he came and they were beyond friendly about it and sent him right back out. Great attitudes and fast delicious pizza"}
{"text":"This is the PERFECT place to order from in Las Vegas.  They were so friendly and helpful with figuring out a good place to meet at the entrance of the huge hotel.  They even recognized us when we ordered again our 2nd night.  Definitely recommend their pizza and calzones."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Im a huge pizza fanatic and this joint is a must try in Sin City! Its been around longer than Ive been alive and is still consistently pleasing customers. Checked previous reviews and decided to give them a shot. The philly is the best Ive had in my life! The small business family customer service was pleasant and on point. Will definitely be reccomending to my friends..."}
{"text":"Came here an hour before close and refuse to take my order saying they we're getting ready to close"}
{"text":"We were so hungry that I didn't have time to take a picture of the food. This place food wise does not disappoint. Everytime were in town and my picky eaters (the kids) want something to eat, this is our go to spot. Haven't been to the actual location, we did delivery which takes longer than they quote. If its 45 mins, expect another 10 mins hence the 4 stars.

Nothing fancy but the portions are huge for very reasonable prices and not to mention taste real good. Last night we had their pizza and wings. Pizza was hot, fresh and delicious, same goes for their wings. We ordered about 20 pieces but it only came with 2 bleu cheese cups but they were crispy which we like! I saw some reviews regarding their chicken wings being small and indeed they were. They were more so like drumettes but Id rather eat those versus large hormone raised and injected with solution to make them fat kinda wings.

Today we had the eggplant parm dinner and spaghetti and meatballs and it was very flavorful unlike places where it tastes like they threw some tomato sauce on it and thats it. Again, portions are huge. These 2 dinners which included garlic bread and salad fed all 5 of us with plenty of leftovers for under 20 bucks. Id say 1 dinner feeds 2 people and then some. Bon a petite."}
{"text":"I dont normally do reviews but i had to this guy is hilarious had me laughing the whole time i was waiting for my pizza if all immigrants were like him we would still be the best country in the world and some awesome cheap pizza to thanks !"}
{"text":"This place is not in the best location but friendly (and funny) service and great pizza! Fresh and flavorful made by Sicilians. Satisfied my craving!"}
{"text":"You got to come in and order kids. If you want delivery or online order this ain't your place. I agree with the frustration Yury should probably stop advertising he delivers or quit accepting grub hub orders. Pizza is excellent, not the best I've ever had but great for price and convenient from my work. 

Yury is a character and great to talk to. If you want something in a hurry or use them computers you kids like so much look elsewhere. This is old school laid back neighborhood stuff."}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti with marinara, garlic bread, and Zucchini. I ordered through yelp, took about 10 minutes to get there and it was ready when I walked through the door. The area is a bit questionable, probably would not go alone at night again. Drove the 10 minutes back to my hotel and ate right away. The spaghetti was cooked perfect, the sauce was good. The garlic bread was soggy and a little too garlicky. And the Zucchini was soggy (probably frozen). I would go back for the spaghetti and maybe try a piece of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Very Good Pie.
Received a flyer under the hotel door for a competing pizza place.
A quick read of reviews prompted a search for another (that's how we found Sicili's).  Pizza and simple salad were excellent."}
{"text":"If I could've left  0 stars, I would've. To be honest I didn't even get the chane to order because of how rude the person I called to order from.  He wasn't very helpful and acted as if I was bothering him by asking what kind of lunch specials are they offering. The reply I received was \"Well what are you looking for!?\" With an nasty attitude!  I will not be ordering from this establishment."}
{"text":"Absolutely great pizza!!  Only problem was I ate every darn bite!!! Very fast and very friendly delivery."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch always hot & fresh and the service is always excellent.from pizza to burgers to philly steak and etc delicious!"}
{"text":"The Supreme was just what the doctor ordered.  The thin crust was perfect, the fresh ingredients make this a must repeat on my next order!  The staff and service met all expectations.
Mike the SLC pizza tester."}
{"text":"\"Don't judge the book by its cover\".

 A simple, hole in the wall kind of place. Where the pizza is always made from scratch from their dough all the way to their sauces. 

I was never been a fan of Hawaiian Pizza, but I was given a slice to try. Loved the ham in it. It was not the typical salty ham you get from the other pizza place.  

The chicken wings, it just need a little super sizing to do.  Aside from that it's crispy and tasty.

Customer service is right on, you get taken care of fast. Order a pizza! you get it in 10 minutes tops and that's to go or eat in. Atleast thats my experience. Went there twice already and still planning on coming back. 

Met the owner Yuri, such a nice young gentleman. Talks to you and makes you feel right at home. Hey! we even got a couple of free sodas for first time customers. Now where can you find service like that."}
{"text":"Great pizza & wings. Great prices. Mostly carry-out, but some dine-in seating. Authentic Italian!"}
{"text":"Based on recent reviews, I gave Sicili's a try - and was pleased.

I had $5 lunch special - 1 personal pizza, which includes 1 topping and 1 drink. 
When I mentioned to fellow who makes the pizza that he didn't sound Sicilian, he joked I should try the pizza first, which I did:  thin crust, chewy cheese with mushrooms that was just right.

Yuri (right, Russian) and his family have been owners for about 5 years.   He learned his craft well.   (I asked Yuri about Russia and  Putin, but  Yuri probably thought this wouldn't be good for business.  I'll ask again.)

The reason they don't keep slices ready is because most of their business is either pickup ( or delivery) and he'd rather cook it fresh, not reheated.   But the pizza I ordered really was ready quickly, ~5 minutes.

Sicili's is small, simple, storefront, in a strip mall and probably most of their business are locals who order and then  pickup (or delivery to hotels, I image).   There are 3 small tables, so I had no problem eating-in. 

[Actually, I  took the CX bus, which runs between downtown and UNLV, and then walked ~10 minutes to Sicili's.   But I admit the location is 'close' but not the Strip, not UNLV, not downtown.   It is a 2-3  minutes walk east of Hughes Corporate Center, which itself  is just east of the Wynn and the Strip, and I could see the monorail (closest stop?)    ]

On the walk back to the CX bus,  I had the nagging feeling I should have ordered a second one,  to go.    Next time.

For those who care, I checked here too (http://www.cchd.org/restaurants/inspections.php)
 all As."}
{"text":"While I was waiting for pizza to get done, sitting inside waiting, I saw 2 cockroaches on the wall near the oven.   Furthermore this cardboard pizza is not good.   Nor is the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. The delivery took longer than expected, but I'm assuming that is due to their popularity. We ordered the thin crust. It was perfect and tender. I love the sauce they used, and the cheese. You will not go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing! They are the nicest people and have seriously delicious pizza, spaghetti, and lasagna!

I arrived at my hotel (Vdara) and was having major pizza cravings and didn't want to leave to get my food. So, I looked to yelp and found Sicili. The guy on the phone was super nice and the ETA for the food was right on point! 

My girlfriends and I are so happy with this place and their food. We are definitely going to keep ordering from here, that's for sure!

My post is a bit late cause as soon as the food came-- I was too busy stuffing my face. :D"}
{"text":"So I been eating here for two days straight and the first day of this pizza was amazing the second day was not so good I felt like I eating a pizza with cheese and no toppings but overall this pizza place it is very very good it's very delicious and I really recommend it they have a special if you want to order a personal Pizza is only $5 with a can of soda customer service is by far the best and the prices are very reasonable once again I really recommend this place 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the vegetarian pizza and a dinner salad, both of which had generous, fresh toppings. The crust on the pizza had a great texture and flavor -- thin, but not like a cracker -- instead, fresh and homemade tasting with pleasantly charred edges as though cooked in a brick oven. The salad was crisp and cold and was pleasantly bigger than I expected. Delivery was also reasonable and arrived before the projected time with the pizza still hot."}
{"text":"Great pizza and awesome service. Ordered the pizza to go. The marinara sauce was awesome. The garlic knots were fabulous."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Here on business, delivered to the convention center. Quick and delicious. All the booths around us asked for scicilis pizza info!! My colleagues enjoyed and we will order from them again next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Brought my family of eight because we were passing through Vegas on a cross country trip. Yuri made us a couple of great pizzas found room for us to sit and we got out for under $35. 
The best meal for the money we had the whole trip and what great fun we had. We will be back during our next great adventure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in Las Vegas. Great friendly staff and they also deliver."}
{"text":"We're new to Vegas (Moved here 11/2014) and haven't found a good place yet, that's near our house, to order a week night pizza. So, after using Yelp, we decided to order from here, last night. My husband called, ordered us a large pepperoni, with extra cheese, and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. 
It took my husband 15 minutes to get there, and the pizza was ready and waiting. The gentleman was very nice (that's from my husband, I was patiently waiting at home), and had my husband in and out. 

Our total came to $12. Geez. Thats just cheap! 

So, he gets home, we pop in a movie, and open that pizza box. 

We have found the happiness portal to heaven! 

We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"$8 for XL pizza?! You kidding me! After paying $12 for two horrible slices at the convention center - I knew for the next day i would find something better. Yelp does not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great people! We were in town for a convention and after reading yelp decided to give them a try and so glad we did!  Nice to know its a family owned and run business , much rather give my money to those that need it not some big chain pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Vegas...and we're talking delivery here. Wife had cheese pizza and loved it. I had my usual \"trinity\" of toppings (pepperoni, olives & mushrooms) and found the pizza light and delicious. A trip straight to flavor town.
Note: the Sicily's w/ a \"y\" is a different joint and to be skipped."}
{"text":"Pizza and hot wings were so good! Delivery was right to the door! So fast, so professional and so so yummy! Met our high expectations!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are 12 inches for the price of a large. And the menu didn't specify this. The delivery guy delivered the pizza then ran away as fast as he could before I could realize it, OR tip him, because he knows this happens frequently. $15 for a pizza I can eat as an appetizer. When I called, the guyI blamed me for ordering online, you know, since their Yelp app inadequately informs people of their pricing. Bullshit. Want a refund."}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time 2 years ago, since then we have come here very often. 
The food is really delicious, the staff very friendly, the services are amazing and very reasonable prices. Highty recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  

Location is the dumpy, divey, sketchy Twain Avenue at Palos Verdes St.  I've never witnessed anything violent there, but there are plenty of derelict-looking people standing and shuffling around on the street, so you may feel uneasy.  I wouldn't let it deter you from visiting, however; they seem harmless.

Pizza quality was pretty good; definitely better than the Palermo's location located across the street.  It was also ready in the 15 minutes it was promised."}
{"text":"Just called and asked if they had any specials... The idiot on the other line asked \"what type of specials?\" Ummm pizza specials? He got angry named 3 different pizzas and said ok bye bye and hung up. I can't make this up. Guess he didn't feel like working today. Terrible."}
{"text":"God knows, I've eaten a lot of pizza in my life. But I'll have say, this pizza was one of the best pepperoni and sausage pizzas I've eaten. It was delivered, 19 mins, it was hot, not greasy, and it tasted great. Friendly service. Will definitely order next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best delivery in town. I crave this pizza. I have dreams about this pizza. The more I think about this pizza the more I find myself wondering why I'm not eating one right now. I don't know why you're still reading this, aren't you hungry? Stop living vicariously through me and go get one."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and the pizza tastes amazing. Their salads are generous portions and I Crave it constantly"}
{"text":"I am such a Pizza foodie; and travel to Italy every year; since I've been a kid. I moved to Vegas in August 2013; and searched for an even decent pizza place for months on end; always resulting in just mediocre places that left me unsatisfied. One night while searching on Yelp for pizza places that would deliver to the Strip (as we local's know; not many places do); I came across several great reviews for Sicili's. I figured \"why not\"........So I ordered a Large Pepperoni, an order of Wings (Hot) without the Fries (which are steak fries, by the way-yum), a 2ltr of Soda and an order of Cheesey Garlic Bread. For $23? A STEAL! To include in the already great deal I had gotten; they provided me with Free delivery. The pizza itself mocks itself identically as true Sicilian Pizza; for those of you who don't know, is the American Version of NY Style pizza---Simply Delicious! The bread was soft, and provided a sweet taste to it; but the ingredients itself made this pie simply one of the best pizza's I have ever tasted. \"I was hooked\"..........The ranch that comes with the wings, is churned and made fresh; and tastes unlike any ranch I have ever had. I began ordering in January; and with truth; I have ordered from Sicili's 2-3 times a week every since; and it still continues to be if not my favorite place to grab a great meal from. Dont be confused as there is another similar place with the same name; however spelled only different by a few letters. Sicily's Pizza------DO NOT EAT THERE. I made the grave mistake of ordering from them, thinking it was Sicili's and boy was I wrong!
Anyways; you cannot go wrong ordering from here; I vow by it! The family themselves are so pleasant and so warm; I always feel like I'm walking into my Mom's kitchen when I stop by to make an order. \"Ten Thumbs Up\""}
{"text":"We have had pizza and combos from here many times. The #6 is a great deal. Father and son own and run the place, cook, cashier, etc. They deliver and if you are picking up it's in a rough little strip center. Quality always good and they treat you like they want repeat business. i have seen them go out of there way to please an obvious visitor on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"This place was so good. 

We had the Hawaiian and a pepporroni mushroom. The pizza was good and really hit the spot. 

If you're craving pizza this is the place to call. They deliver to your hotel. All you have to do is go downtairs and pick it up."}
{"text":"This was around the corner from our hotel so we walked over. It's small for eat-in but there were some small tables and stools. Service was friendly and the pizza was good, though not great. Lots of toppings on the \"special\" but not much flavor to the crust. Limited selection of beverages. The menu offered much more than pizza and I will probably try them again."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in town.

Me and 4 of my employees order their $5 personal pizzas from here almost every Wednesday for our Pizza Wednesday.

The $5 for the personal pizza is a steal. It's 8 small slices that are just enough. The pizza is REALLY good.

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was at the Las Vegas Convention Center and wanted to order pizza for our set up crew and found Sicili's on Yelp.  Yuri answered the phone and could not have been more patient and helpful with all my questions.  In the end I ordered 3 large pies, 20 wings and two large sodas.  Since we were at the convention center I requested, plates, napkins, cups, etc.  The pies were cooked perfectly, there was no shortage of toppings and everything was received as requested.  Thanks for the great pies and customer service Yuri, you and your team made our labor crew very happy!

Cheers,

John"}
{"text":"Second time visiting Vegas and this place is definitely worth a review. Granted it's not in a safe looking location but that where you find some of the best foods; holes in the wall! The wings are good plain with sauce on the side. They have good deals on pizza's though it could use a lil more cheese. I'm Philly born and raised, I have to say the cheesesteaks are good! They don't have cheese wiz but add with mayo, grilled onions, and American chz, and it's almost like home. Would highly recommend to try if your looking for a pizza joint. Food is definitely fairly priced and service is good; \"Pops\" behind the counter is friendly but always ready (if you know what I mean)."}
{"text":"How in the..


This is a weird one
Ordered a variety of treats
Mozzarella sticks, good
Salad, boring
Pizza, I wouldnt feed my dog
Spaghetti..that tasted like 
Giada cooked it herself
Perfectly timed noodles
And a bolognese sauce 
That I would guess is already mixed with cheese

Skip the meatballs
Clearly they dont have the secret ingredient..
Lamb mixed into the regular ground 

PS: had a second round with the spaghetti and had to add another star, its delicious, the cheese sauce..still boring meatballs but the pasta is perfect"}
{"text":"Sorry I made a review  about this pizza place, and is was the wrong place..VERY SORRY..
The place i had a bad experience  with was Sucily'S Pizza on Durango..."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, convenient location (just few blocks off Las Vegas Blvd) and the food flavor was great. I ordered a family meal for 4 and it was plenty to feed 5-6. Thumbs up to this place!"}
{"text":"Ive been deployed to Sicily countless times, love the pizza pie their. This is the closest thing to heaven!  Get some!  Totally enjoyable and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I just received my order from my favorite pizza place \"sisili's pizza\" and it's not good crust was super rubbery . It seems as though they took an old cheese pizza put toppings on it and threw it back in the oven. I guess the reason I loved the food so much was because I was ordering a BBQ chicken pizza, which required it be made fresh since they don't have it laying around. I'll order else where next time."}
{"text":"Yummy, inexpensive lunch spot. Great alternative to the traditional chain and the owner is super friendly. It is definitely a hole in the wall, but yummy nevertheless. Only two tables available for eating, but most people seem to take their food to go. I enjoyed a fresh mushroom pizza with bottled water for only $5. It was a nice size portion and delicious. Good service and worth a visit if you are nearby."}
{"text":"They're all about the pizza.  They do one thing, they do it well.  They don't do kiddy play areas.  They don't do salad bars.  They don't do weird crusts...and they let you kill time while you're waiting for AAA!"}
{"text":"i would agree with most of you's its probably the best delivery in the area.
i did not eat my pizza fresh :( i order a pizzer and wing wing special, i ate my wings and fries first and then saved the pizzer for dinner. it was still very good."}
{"text":"Found this little gem Mom and Pop pizza restaurant when we first moved to Vegas and it's the best pizza around.  We have it delivered and they are always on time and get the order right.  Hawaiian pizza is top-notch and so are there calzones."}
{"text":"I drive 24 miles round trip just to get a taste of there pizza.  Boris the owner along with his sons make the best pizza in Southern Nevada.  The chicken fingers and wings are also great.  The last time I had a double bacon cheeseburger, had it finished before I was on Flamingo, If your in the area please stop by for a ex large poizza."}
{"text":"This might be the best fast pizza I've had outside of NYC. They even deliver to the strip right to the hotel rooms so that was awesome. It only took about an hour and with the madness of EDC that weekend, I thought it was pretty quick. We got a large supreme and man did it have that awesome flavor that I've missed from NYC. It was a little soggy towards the middle of the pie, but I forgave it for the amazing flavor. I will definitely be ordering here again when I'm in Vegas. Be sure to search for Sicili's & not Sicily's as I saw both nearby."}
{"text":"Ran out to grab a pizza, the morning after a late night of partying.  Called in my order, and it was ready shortly after I arrived (I was nearby in the car.)  Large cheese pizza and 2 drinks was under $11.  The pizza was crispy and tasted great, and the service was good.  I love finding these places just off the strip - can't recommend it any higher!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst pizza I've had. It was sloppy and soggy. The sausage was the same rubber stuff you only find on the cheapist of frozen pizza's."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price, and great service! This is a cute little pizza joint right next to an affordable laundromat. The pizza came out quick and was delicious. Everyone there was super nice which made the experience that much better. Would definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I was quoted 45-60 minutes for my order. It actually arrived at 88 minutes, and I'm very close to the shop. When I called at 79 minutes, my order was still at the store. The manager was very rude over the phone. The delivery driver was nice though. The ribs were okay. The Italian sub was horrible. It was cold. It was so sloppy and caked in sauce. The meat literally slid off the bread. All I could taste was sauce. I don't recommend this place to anyone. If the food was good, the wait wouldn't be that bad. But, overall, it was a one star. Try apologizing to your customers for the wait instead of saying, \"busy, busy\" and hanging up! Make your food edible and presentable. It looked like y'all just dipped my sandwich in a container of sauce. It didn't even look good."}
{"text":"In from California to attend a weekend swim meet. We wanted something quick and kid friendly food. We ordered cheese pizza, meat lovers pizza, ham & cheese calzone, spaghetti and meatballs, cheese steak sandwich, and wings.  All of this for about $50 bucks.  The food hit the spot. You get plenty of food for the price.

We went to pick up the food as our hotel was right around the corner. Very friendly service. However, the area is not the safest."}
{"text":"Doesn't bother me that they are in the middle of crack alley, they deliver to my work (which is less than 2 miles from here) so I was willing to give them a try. We ordered a large pie and chicken wings. Delivery took awhile and the pizza was less than desirable. Crust was greasy and soggy. Ingredients were clearly from the Sysco wholesaler. The wings were hilarious. I took a picture of one. It's smaller than a ketchup packet. There wasn't any meat on them! I didn't think this place was that cheap like others had mentioned. Sorry Joseph A, you don't know good pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great ingredients cooked to perfection.  
Friendly staff.  Great prices!  I'm used to good pizza after years of living in New Jersey... This does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Ok it sucks! I ordered on grubhub and left in the delivery instructions how to get in the apartment complex and to my apartment. It's like it's to hard for them to park in front and walk in. If they cannot drive in the complex they won't use the call box and walk in, so they call you to walk down and meet them at their car. Worst delivery hands down. 

I ordered large pizza half Hawaiian half pepperoni and a bucket of fingers with sauce on the side. The pizza was horrid. Even the pepperoni couldn't mask the cardboard flavor. The fingers didn't have the sauce. 

Bad food bad service. A waste of $40"}
{"text":"The man who took my phone delivery was so polite and understanding! Currently on vacation out here for a festival and I am really bad at pronouncing street names. Ordered the 3 large pizza deal for $28.99."}
{"text":"I love this place ..
I heard about this spot through my manager and fell in love. They have really great wings and amazing pizza. It's definitely worth the drive since I live in the Summerlin area. The restaurant is family owned which is awesome cause the customer service is fantastic. Great prices!!! 
Don't mix this one up with the one on Durango, Go to the one on Twain ... Thank me later"}
{"text":"I just tried to get a delivery to our room at Excalibur and was told \"no to Excalibur\" and when I asked why that was, I was hung up in with no explanation. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza and bread sticks we ordered were good and the price was great! It is definitely in the GHETTO so be prepared...but, once you get past that the owner was friendly and we watched them make our food right in front of us while we chatted."}
{"text":"We order for delivery and they promised us 30-45 min wait and the food came 2 hours late and it was cold and frozen and I didn't tip the guy for that reason so he got mad and said next time order from somewhere else I DO NOT RECCOMENDTHAT PLACE AND NEVER WILL I ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN"}
{"text":"My first choice didn't offer delivery so I went with sicili's because it had good reviews. I ordered online with a 20% discount, this made me happy. I ordered a large thin crust pizza with peperoni and Jalapeños. After 2 hours I decided to call them to check on my order. The first number I called listed on Yelp didn't work, the number listed on there website worked. The attendent seemed very confused and seemed to have no clue regarding my order. After a long hold time, and being disconnected they told me I didn't put an order in, which I quickly refuted as my CC was charged and a confirmation was given from there website. After a few more minutes on hold my order magically appeared. She let me know that the order was on its way. After another 30 minutes there was a knock at the door. The delivery guy was very nice but the order was wrong. The pizza was not thin crust and it seemed that they took a cheese pizza that had been out all night, added toppings and sent it out. The jalapeño poppers and the pizza were also VERY cold, making my first experience very bad with Sicili's. I am disappointed that they didn't even offer an apology for the long wait and then delivered below par cold food. I am not very picky and not much of a complainer but I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was out last week and saw this place on Yelp but was unable to try it out.  Back again in Vegas and the wife and I were tired and decided to order some pizza and have it delivered to the room.  Even though the website we ordered through said 35 to 45 minutes, I expected at least an hour since it was Monday night and football was going on.  I was right, it actually took 1  hour and 10 minutes, but like I said it was expected.

On to the food!  We ordered a 16 inch all meat pizza and a dozen wings.  The pizza was very good, definitely what we call a fold over, meaning you cant just pick it up and eat it without folding it.  I was very impressed with the price as well as the taste.  The wings were also very, good, not as big as others have claimed, but they were crispy and not soggy like other places.  They delivered right to the room and the man that brought the food was very polite.  If you are ever in Vegas and decide that you are tired of the hectic eating, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from here and must say the good reviews don't lie, I've recently moved into the area and have found my go to pizza spot. The sauce and cheese they use are the real deal and the prices are reasonable especially for the quality you get. My only complaint (if you call it one) is the size of the dinning area. It's more of pick up or delivery joint."}
{"text":"Yuri is a real good dude that's takes pride in his work, every meal is made fresh, me personally if I don't get the hot wings & fries I get the combo cheese steak meal,, 
only lil food joint around here I'll eat at, for a few different reasons, go check out Sicili tho. tell Yuri I sent ya,!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat some pizza and happy I chose this place.  Good reviews and I can't complain.  Pizza was delicious.  Not too heavy or too light on the dice.  Would've liked more pepperoni, but the crust was perfect.  There was a slight burned taste, which is similar to the taste of ny style pizza.  I would order from here again."}
{"text":"First off, I'm from Chicago and we have great pizza there, except the deep dish crap. We all loved this pizza so much that we ordered it 3 times in 3 days."}
{"text":"The first bite is awesome. The crust is fluffy and doughy. It dwindles down pretty quickly, but I would say the first bite really made me a fan. I really enjoyed this pizza thoroughly. The wife was making it in the back, and the owner in the front was frying chicken wings. I know it's definitely a locals joint because I saw many people come in their pajamas in the evening. Boris is the owner and his european car is parked right outside. He is always on the phone taking orders in Russian or possibly spying and speaking code. Who really knows? I only know that for good pizza, I now have another clue about where to go."}
{"text":"They don't have to be so rude about not delivering to aria. And if it bothers the cashier to answer that question, they need to post a list of hotels the do and don't deliver to."}
{"text":"I don't live in this part of town but if I did, this would be where I would get my pizza.  We were visiting family staying on the strip and everyone wanted pizza.  We found this place on Yelp with great reviews and it did not disappoint.  For me the most important and part of pizza is the crust and this crust was excellent.  Not too thin and not to thick.  Pepperoni was on the spicy side but I liked it.  Chicken fingers were awesome.  The guy working there, I think he may have been the owner, was extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Loved this pizza !  Customer service was .  Would drive all the way from calif if I wanted more of this pizza !   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I accidentally left my wrong phone number. Staff called me at my hotel room to verify my order and to tell me they were beginning to make it. It arrived shortly thereafter. This pizza is what I like. The dough is thin but stout and able to hold the toppings. Good cheese which melts just the way I like. Good flavor."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in the food. We ordered 2 meat lasagnas , buffalo wings and salad. It had no flavor. The noodles were over cooked the bread was horribly chewy and I would not recommend this place. We ordered this place due to the fact they deliver but never again. If you want flavor don't go here. Sorry but it's the truth"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery for pepperoni pizza, green salad, spaghetti and meatballs. Food was good and delivery fee was nominal $2."}
{"text":"Go elsewhere, do not consider.  Garlic cheese bread was decent.....tiramisu was very average and the pizza was bland and very forgettable.  Dough, sauce, cheese, hard to screw up but somehow they nailed it.  I am talking bottom of the barrel and I thought that Sbarro held that honor.  If Sicili's and Sbarro are next door and those are your only options....go with Sbarro sadly.  It has a 4 star rating so it is possible I experienced an off night.  

Sorry Sicili's.  On the plus side, delivery was made faster than advertised."}
{"text":"I was in there today and I made an order of just chicken wings, as I was waiting for my order a couple walked in. Now this isn't the nicest of neighborhoods but the man in the front knows all the customers. I came in previously to order pizza for my son's birthday in October and he still remembered me from then.  the couple that walked in looks to be homeless, well they ordered and the front man gave them a discount. It wasn't a big discount it was pretty much just the tax but still he gave them a deal because he knows not everyone has a lot of money but everyone is hungry. They must be regular customers and he treated them very amazing. Most people in the neighborhood don't treat everyone like there humans like this man. It was very nice! If I could give more then a 5 star I would."}
{"text":"I can only speak the white sauce pizza since that's what I ordered, but I can confidently say that it is THE BEST pizza I've ever had. They estimated that it would take 45-60 minutes to deliver and they knocked on the door at 35. Great pizza. On-time delivery. What more could you need?"}
{"text":"Just not good.  Got the pizza in 90min.  The pizza was cold and the cheese cake was warm. Based on the reviews from others and the pictures of the pizza I thought it would be better. Really bad experience."}
{"text":"Good prices! Turkey sub was delicious. Buffalo Wings and fries were good too! Great service! Will order again"}
{"text":"I traveled across the earth. Tested the forces of nature. Traversed the distance of 1.6 miles along a treacherous path. All to prevail in my destiny; that is above all other men. Was totally worth.

P.S: i recommend the chicken / olive combo. So good."}
{"text":"Was in town again and picked up another plethora of food. We got the bbq chicken pizza and the garlic butter with additional chicken topping. Again I was not disappointed. I loved that the chicken topping on the garlic butter was breaded and deep fried. Like having fried chicken on my pizza. Haha go 'murica. 

My friends and I devoured the cheese garlic bread and it was as if we never even had it. That will always be a part of my meal from here!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER!

Seriously this is homemade fresh authentic pizza! these are hand tossed, fresh ingredients and cooked to order HOT! 

Yes it is in the hood but the parking lot is well lit, it has security and there is a huge Laundromat next door that is always busy so I feel completely safe in and out of here.

Yuri takes really good care of his customers.

I love the personal pizza deal, right size even for a guy, but I can share this with someone easily and the price is very competitive.

I have never tried the delivery service I always pick up. My order is ALWAYS ready when promised.

When I want pizza and I am by the Strip this is where I go!"}
{"text":"Great pizza that won't break your wallet.  3 small tables with 6 stools total inside if you want to grab a seat and eat in.  The staff is very social and will shoot the bull with you and you feel like one of the gang.  Come here when you want a nice inexpensive meal that will satisfy you."}
{"text":"The owner is so sweet he knows what he's doing whenever I'm in town this is the ONLY pizza shop I buy from.. Pizza is fresh everything is quality you can taste prices are AMAZING you can't beat this shop. Much love to the cooks"}
{"text":"ANY TIME im in VEGAS..im ordering from here .  We ordered cheese pizza, meat calzone (added pepp and sausage for my meat loving boys) the Greek Salad..SOoooo good and a GREAT price! FORGET about those over priced strip joints (pizza joints that is)  took this back to our fancy smancy hotel room..and was gone in seconds!  Family owned, and refreshing to  get REAL quality customer service and gratitude even..met Father and 2 sons..all very kind and pretty funny."}
{"text":"This is how pizzerias should be. Relatively inexpensive, delicious food and friendly staff. Not in the best neighborhood of Las Vegas this little gem shines brightly offering pizza, wings, pastas and more. They make everything fresh so no partially stiff ready to go pizza here. I suggest you come in and sit down, grab a coca cola, enjoy the tiny little spot with some tv and chat with the employees here. Theyre always striking conversation with customers or the locals passing through. You feel a sense of community around this little shin dig and I think that along with the food makes it a great little place."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite pizza in all of Las Vegas!! I've been going to Sicilis for about 4 years now, and have always been greeted with a smile, great customer service and THE BEST FOOD!!! 

Uri who by this time has become a regular face to me considering I've tried everything on the menu will do everything in his power to make sure that your dining experience is superb. Wether you have a massive 28\" pizza delivered, you pick up an order of hot wings or you try my favorite the white pizza you will not be let down. Calzone,white  pizza and lasagne are my definite top picks!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza, chicken strips, and a sofa online. After about an hour and a half I cancelled my order. They never showed up. When I called the place they were already closed. Don't waste your time. I don't recommend all!"}
{"text":"Looks like yelpers are catching on to Sicili.
This is the best pizza at the best price.

Forget Metro, forget Napoli, forget Big Mamma and Big Papas, forget Joey's, forget Rocco's, forget Pop-Up, forget Familia....
And stop overpaying for average pizza at Grimaldis, or Due Forni, or Dom DeMarco.

Sicili is the real deal in a world of fake advertising. 
Don't believe the nonsense. 
Find the truth.....it lives in a shabby strip mall on Twain, east of Paradise.
(The truth often lives where you least expect it!)"}
{"text":"I found this place when a flyer was slipped under my door at the Red Roof Inn on Paradise. I usually get 2 or 3 flyers per night from various places.

I have ordered from them several times. I normally order delivery from EAT24.COM, but today I needed to go out anyway, so I decided to do pick up. The brothers working there Guido and Roma were very friendly.

They give a massive amount of food for your money, and it tastes good. What more can you ask for? 

There are plenty of eating options in Las Vegas, but I prefer to stay off of the strip when I am in town for work."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Amazing pizza.  Loved the dough!  Super quick delivery."}
{"text":"The pizza was great!  There was an hour and half wait but it was worth it.  They were kind enough to tell us about the estimated delivery time."}
{"text":"We ordered an 18inch 2 topping pizza and garlic bread. Great price for quality of ingredients. Quick delivery time. Friendly service. Looking forward to trying other menu options."}
{"text":"Got the all meat pizza and an order of wings with fries to share with my brother. Had plenty of leftovers. Delicious pizza. The wings were really good, but really salty. The fries were hot and well seasoned. Will definitely try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Soooo good!!! Was doing laundry, felt hungry, gave  a shot! 
I will never ever regret! Those guys from the same country as me! TURKMENISTAN
Was really happy to talk in my mother language!"}
{"text":"Much love to Yuri and his amazing pizza. Got to Vegas and wanted something delicious and quick and sicilis had it all! Best pizza in town, if you aren't there you are missing out!"}
{"text":"4 star pie for a 5 star price! I'll go 4.5 stars.

$7.99 for a large 1 topping, pickup only. My standard pepperoni w/ extra cheese was $10.42 with tax (as of August 2015). A seriously strong value. 

HIGHLY recommended. Very good  Cheese steak is great too.

Word of caution, the neighborhood is VERY SKETCHY, keep your eyes open."}
{"text":"Is this a gourmet, Strip-style 30$ pizza? Absolutely not.  Is it really really really really good  for being 10$? Absolutely. This is where you come when youve only got a few bucks but really really really want a pizza. It's worth it. Don't be scared off by the low prices - their quality is way higher than the price point suggests. Would come back again and again."}
{"text":"Website not working and guy that answered the phone got Frustrated with me when I started asking about what pizzas they offer and their specials. He turned around and hung up on me. A few minutes later when I called back he simply picked up the phone and hung it up. I cannot and would not recommend calling or buying from this place as a customer service was horrible."}
{"text":"I had to get lunch for a lot of people, called Sicili's with an hour notice. Everything was ready on time and everybody liked it. The meat pizza was the most popular."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from here and the food was splendid. I ordered chicken Parmesan and my boyfriend got the meat ravioli. The food was cheap and it came in a really good portion. I didn't even get to finish all of it! But that's fine, leftovers for me ;). 

The chicken parm was good, was kind of weird that it was at the bottom so it didn't have that crispyness to it. It's fine though, I enjoyed my dish. 
The boyfriend was content with his ravioli (he's kind of hard to please) but he liked it. 

Portions were nice, pricing was good, locations a little iffy but it was a get in and get out type of visit for us. I'm surely going to order here again and hopefully they'll have baked ziti! Also dinner specials come with very yummy garlic bread and a small salad with your choice of dressing."}
{"text":"The lasagna, pizza and ravioli are all fantastic. Not only is the food great but the price is very reasonable especially compared to the over-priced food in the strip hotels."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered a large Vegetarian for delivery... It was so delicious!  The crust was perfect, the cheese was very fresh and creamy melted.. the veggies were so fresh and the pizza was made with love... they were so friendly over the phone and delivery came pretty fast...sooner than they said it would and pizza was piping hot. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. Yuri doesn't mind special requests and the wait time is reasonable. I highly recommend Sicili's."}
{"text":"Sicili's Pizza is a ghetto pizzeria on E Twain just @offthestrip. But what the hell.they deliver!

If you went in person you'd probably turn around or drive by because it is GHETTO!

CHEAP EATS-wings,fingers and pizza.

Pizza is a little undercooked for my taste and the wings a little skimpy!!
FINGERS were big and good but 2/3 #fail!"}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni pizza and cheesy garlic bread and both were seriously SO GOOD! We ordered carry out online and the guy working the counter was really friendly. Made me smile. Pretty cheap prices too. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to a hotel. It was prompt and hot. The BBQ chicken pizza was amazing and more than I was hoping for. Garlic bread was decent but I would have preferred more garlic. The chocolate cake was not cake it was actually pie. They forgot to deliver my Diet Coke with my order. Even with that they will get 4 stars for the quality of the food. I would definitely order from again."}
{"text":"Our company has \"Pizza Wednesday\" and we ALWAYS order from here. If you're looking for a pizza with the right flavor and right size for lunch, give this place a shot. $5 dollars for a pepperoni pizza... and $1 for each additional topping. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery. Found them on yelp and gave a blind try. Their Calzones are the best I've had in Vegas. I was born and raised, attended college, grad school, and worked in Jersey and New York until I went to Law School in Miami and this place is the only place outside of the Northeast that has authentic and amazing Calzones."}
{"text":"The customer service was great!!! The value was good I got the family meal small lasagne wich was a good size portion it was seasoned well very tasty.   Unfortunately was a little smashed cuz the salad was pace on top.   I got a small spaghetti also good portion.   The aside was good but had a TON of garlic I like garlic but prolly too much for the average person.   It also included garlic bread very good ... And a Greek salad I asked for the dressing on the side they forgot .  And a small pizza wich was also good!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza in a tough location but definitely worth the trip! Just avoid the liquor store next door.. too many pimps and hoe's standing around.. 
but the pizza is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Top Notch. Unique pizza sauce is fantastic. My favorite pizza in town which is half the price of my 2nd favorite: Grimaldi's. Super good value offered from a Father and Son run shop. I play poker most nights down the street at the Wynn Casino would order the flatbread pizza thru the casino at the restaurant Allegro. The base price is $18 and fill in the blanks for the extra fees/taxes and tips you hand out to people before you have a slice for a lesser product in my opinion. $10 + tip here. Who doesn't prefer spending money at a local small business ? A business that appreciates its customers and gains future business thru word of mouth. If your still reading this STOP and just order NOW !! You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Small store, friendly service, fast delivery and very reasonable price with decent quality. Good lunch choice for show booth staff."}
{"text":"Great food, delivered HOT to the Wynn! Driver was awesome!  Ordered Sicilian pizza, calzone & chicken tenders!  All was great! Especially enjoyed calzone!! Very professional, good price, excellent food!"}
{"text":"I go to Sicily's pizza about once a week and order a large pepperoni. I absolutely loved this place! They are fast and friendly and the quality is awesome"}
{"text":"I ordered from here based off the 4 star review and pics. In the pics there was a pamphlet which is how I saw the menu. It lloked like minimum delivery was $10. Guy that answered the phone was borderline rude and very short with me. He said it would be 1hr to 1hr10min. Delivery came in 55 min.

When I saw the receipt it said $18.40 which threw me for a second. My Hawaiian pizza should have only been $10.99 and my tiramisu $3.50. Tax is 8%. I asked the delivery man for the itemized receipt so I could see what I was charged for each item. He said he didn't have one just the CC receipt which shows the final total. He said there was a $2 delivery charge. I didn't see anything about this on Yelp and when you go to the website it says delivery charges are only for deliveries over 3 miles and the Embassy Suites was only 1.2 mi away. I then did a mock order on their website and on Yelp and that is where I saw that if I had tried to order that way I would have been charged a $2 delivery fee and min order is $15 pre tax. There is no way to know this just by looking at the prices on their site and then calling. What really made no sense was why I was charged $18.40 when had I ordered the same thing via Yelp or their site it would have only been $17.66. So future orderers beware.

Pizza was just okay, nothing special. Pizza Hut is way better in comparison. This was Little Caesars quality for 40% higher cost. Won't order from there again.

One star for delivery under an hour, another star for friendly but unhelpful delivery man that came to my room so I didn't have to go downstairs. -3 stars for overcharging and so-so pizza."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. The pizza was fresh and tasty and the wings were delicious. And the delivery order came early. Great over all."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such rave reviews! I ordered delivery last night and it took about an hour (not bad at all, considering a sunday night). We ordered the fried mushrooms and the garlic butter pizza. Both were below average quality. I would stick to grimaldi's their white garlic pizza is ten times better for the same price ~$20 for a large. 

Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Honestly we came in because of the Yelp reviews. The pizza was good I would say decent. However this place is not worth the stars it has as ratings. Pricing is fair for the amount of food you get. We paid 40.00 for an XL pizza wings, chicken strips and fries. Honestly the wings are good not the best but good. The strips were good and the fries too. However the food tasted greasy honestly like they used old oil. But then again it was fried food so what do you expect. I don't recommend you reheating the food it won't be good we did that and the next day we all were sick with stomach issues. Location is dangerous very very ghetto even the cook had a gun and that told us how bad the area is. Although pricing is good... I'm not sure I would come here again for the food and even expose myself to danger."}
{"text":"This place is highly recommended! I was craving for pizza and found this place thru yelp while I was in vegas for the fourth of july weekend. I decided to try their all meat pizza and it was the best one I ever tasted! the crust or dough was really good and of course their toppings too. I will definitely stop by this place whenever I am in vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slice and wings. Pizza is very delicious and owner is great guy, immigrant from Russia."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is highly influenced by Italian culture. In the \"mob days\" it wasn't uncommon for Italian culture to thrive in the town. The mobsters, many of Italian descent would have families that lived here. The family would set up shop and run a legitimate business in town. Sometimes even mobster's themselves would put up legitimate business as a means to launder money procured in not-so-legal sorts of ways.

Silici's Pizza on Twain claims to have been in business since 1979. That's over 30 years. And while this establishment may or may not have been related with any of the nefarious history of Vegas, I can tell you that this place is ran by the same people who started it many years ago. The owner, a man well into his 70s and his son can often be seen in the place. This place does NO advertising aside from a flier that they rarely ever hand out at random. You have to actually go there to get a menu/flier. It's this kind of charm that really gives this place much appeal. 

But charm alone does not make a good place to eat. Sicili's has to have the best pizza that I have ever eaten. This claim alone speaks bundles since I love pizza and am very picky about it. I resist the cardboard pizza chains (that's you - Domino's, Papa John's, and Little Caesar's) whenever I can. So when I find a solid authentic Italian pizza place, I have to go for it.

Sicili's doesn't skimp on the quality. It's truly as authentic as you can get. The sauce is sweet and tangy and the dough is robust with a flavor all it's own. Their unique blend of cheeses is a secret and the pinnacle of the toppings. Everything from this point is secondary. It's excellent in freshness and quality, but hard to outdo the core of what makes a good pizza splendid. 

This business is strictly carry-out and delivery only. Don't expect to be able to sit down and eat. But then again, that's not what this place is about. The prices are moderate to the higher end. But keep in mind the quality you're getting. If it's a $10 cardboard pizza you want... there's places for that. If you want a quality pie, come to Sicili's and pay the little bit extra.

My $.02 Cents:
4 Stars - Would have rendered a perfect score if the prices were a bit lower. But you do get your money's worth. Good for a treat if you want some genuine Italian style pizza at home. My suggestion - hit up their lunch/dinner specials for the best value."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting or different about this pizza. The flavors, the crust, it is all rather decent but typical. I ordered take out and my pizza had not even been cooked an hour and twenty minutes after ordering. Pizza is one of the simplest, easiest and fastest things anyone could prepare. Such slow service is quite telling for a pizza place."}
{"text":"Seriously in the top 20% of pizza places I have been to in Las Vegas in the 10+ years I've lived here. The previous 2 reviewers nailed it, so I'll keep my review somewhat short. Nothing fancy with the interior, there are indeed 3 tables inside to eat there if you wish, but clearly more of a carry out joint. In a town where so many pizza places taste similar, Sicili's is a real stand out. A must try for the true pizza enthusiast. I have to say I was a little set back when I first walked in. I went to the counter, and the 1st words out of the guy's mouth was \"Wadda ya want\" I thought I mis-heard him and said \"Pardon?\".  Again, he goes \"Wadda ya want\" So with that, I just had to kind of smiled to myself and figured that's how they roll there. BTW, 50 cent upcharge if you use a debit card. I would have never, in a million years, thought to have stopped in here, but thanks to a yelp talk thread, I found out about this place, and I'm so glad I did."}
{"text":"We're from out of town like a lot of people.  We had to go to the laundry facility in the same shopping center.  I'll just say that the location has a lot to be desired.  With that being said the pizza from this place is some of the best pizza we have had.  Hot, well made.  Service was decent too.  We will be back at least 3 more times this year and we will absolutely be ordering from here when we visit again."}
{"text":"Really good.  Friendly and helpful on the phone, and fast, on time, and friendly delivery.  We had chicken on one of our pizzas, and it was nice fresh pieces of chicken breast, and a generous amount."}
{"text":"Could not believe how great this pizza was...especially for the $$ ! The delivery time was quick too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is in a pretty sketchy area, but it was open Christmas night while we were in Vegas, so we went for it. We went to pick it up and the people there were really friendly. We had to wait a little while, but for fresh cooked pizza to order, I'm fine with that. We had the special with meat and veggies and it was good. The price was reasonable too."}
{"text":"Even though this isn't my favorite side of town I have to admit they have that home made  pizza from a true Italian family. I enjoyed My medium Hawaiian pizza all on my own."}
{"text":"Good food. We had cheese pizza and chicken fingers. We really like it. 
It's kind of a rough area with a lot of unsavory characters walking around.  We could probably ask them to bring the order to the car next time."}
{"text":"I had some calzones from here delivered to my hotel.  I chose this place because the delivery fee was very reasonable.   The order was delivered promptly and the calzones were huge and hot.  The driver was very friendly.   I highly suggest this place if you want delivery!"}
{"text":"Yelp says they are open til 9:30. I just submitted an order 9:10, and got a call at 9:17 saying they are close. Never. Ever. Try. This. Place. BS.

Edit: what could the fact that this happened on Mother's Day possibly have to do with anything? Employees rushing home at 9pm to celebrate? And if you know it takes a few days for Yelp to adjust to your new hours, then stay open til 930 while the change gets processed."}
{"text":"Why do I even have to rate it 1 * - This place is the WORST restaurant I have EVER dealt with.  Placed our $40 order at 6pm for delivery to Westgates (1.5 miles from restaurant).  Told us 7pm delivery.  Called them at 7:25pm (were trying to be lenient) and they said they messed up our pizza (we ordered a large CHEESE - how does one mess up a CHEESE pizza) - and that they would be delivering our order within 10 minutes.  Needless to say everything else was cold.  So, I called the manager and he said that if I came to the restaurant he would refund our money and that he would pay for the Uber.  So, we go there and they all acted like they didn't speak any English and has no idea what I was talking about & refused to do anything.  I would rather spend double on anything and eat anywhere else - and I mean ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THERE!!!  OH - and the restaurant area is disgusting, they don't wear gloves, hairnets, nothing & don't wash their hands!  Even our Uber driver was pissed because of what this business did."}
{"text":"My husband did research on pizza places before we came to Vegas and we decided to try Sicili's Pizza and we were not disappointed! We ordered their pizza take out special of $7.99 for a 16\" cheese pizza and we added one topping for an additional $1.75 and a dinner salad for $5.99. The pizza was thin crust and very tasty and the salad was enough for 3 people with lots of sliced tomatoes, red onion, red bell pepper and black olives. They were very friendly and it was nice to see a family running the business. It is located about 1.5 miles from the strip on Twain street. We will definitely be back next time!"}
{"text":"I was in town and needed delivery....I randomly chose this place. I was pleasantly surprised! My kids and I loved the pizza! The app was very easy to use. I received a call shortly after placing my order to verify minor details. Pizza was delivered in a timely manner. Again loved the pizza! Loved the service."}
{"text":"I am staying at a hotel and ordered pizza and wings and was very inconvenienced and disappointed that there was no thought to provide napkins and plates.
 For that very reason, I would not order from this restaurant again. Not to mention that the pizza and the wings were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery, excellent price points. I'm not sure what the fuss is all about their place rocks after working the conference 12 hours today the last thing I want to do is throw myself in the middle of the strip, wait to be seated, wait for my food and drive home. I rather pay for great food, shower up and go to bed on time....

Try this place, be positive with y our experience and don't knock it till you try them.

Job well done folks!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in Vegas. Crisp crust and large slices. Several choices on display but if you don't see what you want, just ask. Very friendly service. Tucked away on 3rd floor. Can't miss small hallways with record covers leading the way. Funniest part is finding it. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Sicili's about a half dozen times now and can say without reservation that they're our favorite pizza place here in Las Vegas.

Good customer service, quality ingredients, great crust, yummy sauce and all of that at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and had the meat lasagna and the double Philly cheesesteak. Both were delicious. The only reason the place loses a star at all is delivery really did take a full hour. That's a long time when you are hungry. The cheesesteak was full of meat, flavorful, and covered in delicious gooey cheese. Yum. The person with me said the lasagna was really good too so kudos to silicili's."}
{"text":"Went here last minute last night, 9:45pm. We were the last customer. They were very accommodating. Large pizza 2 toppings, $9.99 thin crust. Fresh n Hot, yummy too. We could only eat 2 slices each. Good size slices."}
{"text":"I'm staying in Vegas for a convention. I placed an order at 5:30 via Grub Hub. At 6:40 I was contacted by Grub Hub explaining the restaurant cancelled my order because the restaurants driver was stuck in traffic. Now I have to wait 3-7 days for a credit card refund.

I called Domino's Pizza and I had my order in 40 minutes. They even brought me a 2 liter soda because they were out of the 16oz. Next time I'll stick to Domino's."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Amazing selection of pies. The white pizza was amazing! But the best part about this pizza place was the customer service! Renet was so funny and helpful. He really made my day better and my entire experience in the store better. I can't wait to return to try a new pizza. Thank you Sicili's Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is thin crust pizza with a great amount of toppings. Grease soaks the thin crust(just like I like).  The slice I full of toppings so the middle of the pizza will allow the toppings to slide off if you give it a chance.  Let the cheese cool for 10 minutes then you will be able to pick up the slice somewhat easier.  The neighborhood is not the best however.  I would say the pizza is on my top three and definitely my favorite thin crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Got a 1/2 cheese and pepperoni pizza. And wings! 

Great food at a great price! They delivered to the Hotel Lobby of the Grand Chateau where we were staying. 

The only setback is it took 50 minutes for it to get here.  So just be prepare for that!"}
{"text":"Had some issues with delivery location, but pizza was very good and driver was pleasant"}
{"text":"Ordered a 14in all meat pizza and 10wings pizza was very good as well as the wings everything came hot and fresh expected wait time was 35-45 mins but arrived earlier I was staying at the Westin so I did have to meet the delivery guy in the lobby"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and the customer service. The smell was amazing, pizza was very good and the service was impeccable. The gentleman at the register even shakes my hand thanking me for the business! Amazing!!! I will be back even if it means driving a bit to get here!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten pizza from Sicili's.  I drove up to Las Vegas,  from Hesperia,  Ca. The pizza is one of the best that I have ever eaten,  and the ranch sauce is actually the best that I have ever eaten,  which is made by the owners.  Great service,  and friendly owners. This is my pizza joint,  when I come to Vegas for now on."}
