{"text":"Well, it's been a kind of go-to spot for us when the in-laws are in town, because it is close, cheap, kid-friendly and convenient.  But not because it's terribly special.  The food is standard diner fare, and IMHO the best choices are breakfasts.  Nothing that you couldn't do just as well on your own at home, but didn't because you felt like having someone else make it for you, y'know?

The pies look really good, but their crusts are actually drier and flatter than frozen supermarket crusts.  Yuck.  I actually would rather give the place 2 stars, except that we've always had decent service and the diner is clean, spacious and well-lit.  So they squeak one more in.  That and kids eat free on Tuesdays.  And the pot of strong coffee they set in front of you. That also makes up for something.

Go for breakfast.  Served all day.  Hard to mess that up."}
{"text":"The place was empty yet we waited so long for someone that the manager actually came to our table first.

I ordered soup and sandwich with a grilled cheese w/ham and chicken-and-rice soup.

The soup was like liquid salt yet it was somehow flavorful. My mouth was confused but ultimately decided it was gross.

The sandwich was haphazardly put together.  The cheese was not melted but it was sweaty like some heat had been applied.  It was barely toasted and cold.

My (pregnant) wife ordered a cheese burger medium.  It was served medium-rare/rare, cold and without cheese.  Hopefully it was cooked enough that she doesn't get sick.

We let the waitress know that the food needed some work and the kitchen didn't bother to remake it, they just warmed it up and brought it back out 30 seconds later.  So when we got it, it was a slightly drier, crustier version of its former self.

The waitress apologized and offered us desert so we ordered chocolate ganache cheesecake and apple pie slices. 

The cheesecake was terrible.  It may have been the way it was served--which was super cold so the ganache was nearly frozen and smashed the cheesecake when cut, but actually, that was more likely due to the fact that the cheesecake was still nearly raw--but actually, it's probably the recipe, because even if the cheese cake were properly prepared the ganache was so disproportionately thick and sweet, one probably wouldn't taste anything else.  ...but actually, the most interesting part of the cheesecake was the giant hair that was served with it.

I haven't tried the apple pie yet...

One star lost for service lacking.  One star lost for food screwed up.  One star lost for poorly prepared cheesecake.  One star lost for hair in the cheesecake.

Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Got the grilled cheese and veggie lentll soup. Delicious! Highly recommend :) Great service too."}
{"text":"Our family has been here a handful if times. Some food has been great, other food not so much. For example the flavor and spice level if the chili seems to depend on the days chef. 

We go back every now and then and just choose carefully (but breakfast is always good...)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. My wife got the turkey dinner. Holy cow it was good! I loved the Farmer Scramble and biscuit. The peanut butter cupcakes? Amazing! Server was very sweet and very helpful. Atmosphere is friendly and warm. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"We loved the casual dining atmosphere. It was nice to just grab a bite without the fuss. The roasted chicken was moist. Also, the pies and ice cream are a family favorite. Would love to see organic, local, non GMO, non CAFO featured menu items."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, tonight was a bust at Market Street Diner. Not super busy time, but our server was busy doing something besides helping ours or other tables. It took a while to get our orders taken. Then she was busy again while our food sat in the window. Sure enough, waffle fries were cold when they arrived. The replacement hot fries were the best of the meal. Chicken tenders were dry, kids chicken sandwich had a \"gas\" taste, biscuit was really bad too.  :( too bad"}
{"text":"We have been here about 4 times so far but will be going back many more times.  No issues with service or food as others have mentioned.  We like the burgers, sweet potato fries and root beer floats.  Our most recent trip was just after Thanksgiving and we got a Pumpkin Pie to take home... it was the best pumpkin pie that I've ever had!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Sun Prairie a few years back, this place was an excellent choice for casual dining any time of day.

The last few visits have been declining experiences.  

Wait staff is great! 

Management and whoever runs the kitchen are not focused on the food.  The menu is now quite limited and the food is tasteless.  

I would not be so tough except this place was so much better in the past."}
{"text":"Market St Cafe definitely had the small-town diner feel... Loved it! My dad got the buffet while my mom had a scrambler & I ordered the huevos rancheros. Each dish was delicious. Service was a little slow but understandable seeing as it was quite busy. Though we didn't leave with any sweet, I was drooling over all the pies, cakes, & cupcakes. I'll be dreaming about the banana cream pie for awhile."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time. I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo. It was grilled cheese and french onion. The sandwich was a piece of plastic-like cheese on some plain toast. The soup was even worse. It was a tiny bowl of broth with a slice of cheese placed on top. 

Super disappointed, couldn't even eat it. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"This diner is pretty awesome.  Their service awesome and coffee is amazing.  I like the personal coffee pot they put on your table.  I would love to try their breakfast but, can't get enough of their savory burgers... Try the black and blue bacon burger, you can't go wrong!  Heck, they even serve craft beer!
The only bug is that the place could use a little more sweeping.  Oh, and Carl's Cakes is out of sight!  Always save room for pie or take something home from the bakery case."}
{"text":"We found our new go-to for breakfast! I'm a huge Eggs Benedict seeker and loved the Garden Benedict. The huevos rancheros were also a hit. Awesome service topped it off."}
{"text":"My experience at Market Street Diner in Sun Prairie was similar to last Friday morning. As I rummaged through my junk drawer looking for whiteout I found a shiny Sacajawea dollar. Cool right? As I set the dollar down and dug a little deeper in the drawer, I found the parking ticket I angrily shoved in 3 months ago. Bummer right? At least I only paid $89.00 instead of $90.00. Fit Market Street Diner's breakfast in this equation: the pancakes were the Sacajawea coin--light n fluffy with a good syrup absorbance; the strawberry rhubarb pie (which was raved about) was the parking ticket. It was disappointing at first glance and didn't get better in time. I like a good balance between sweet and tangy bitterness in my rhubarb pie--and this was 70% tangy bitter, much like the parking ticket (OK no more allusions to my damn Friday morning). The service and coffee were just right. Our waitress was friendly and warm and brought a big pot of delicious and hot brew. Take the good (5 stars) with the bad (0 stars) and meet in the middle."}
{"text":"I have been thoroughly under-impressed with Market Street Diner. We've had dinner there twice, and both times we left disappointed and unfulfilled. The first visit, I had the chicken chili which tasted like soup from a can, and my husband had a burger which was mediocre at best. We thought we'd try it one more time, and that will definitely be our last time for anything other than breakfast. I ordered the garden veggie wrap. When it came out, the wrap had one chunk of raw squash in it surrounded by lettuce. Where is the \"garden\" in this picture?! I mentioned it to the server, and she brought another which was just slightly better. The wrap had a few chunks of raw zucchini and squash with lettuce. Not much flavor at all, and I was expecting more of a veggie variety. My husband had the crispy chicken sandwich and was underwhelmed. We'll never go back for anything other than breakfast. Too bad it's not more like Monty's on Atwood in Madison."}
{"text":"Market Street Diner is a great choice for comfort food.  It is cute and \"diner\" like (think clean, not greasy spoon), but I usually call ahead and pick-up on nights when I want to cuddle up on the couch and don't want to have to worry about dinner.  They have a convenient drive-thru for call ahead orders which I usually use.  When I go inside to pick up, I'm always tempted into buying some of Carl's Cake's treats (The red velvet cupcakes are my favorite).  I can't say the order I get is always correct (there is usually something small that is wrong... no sauce on the sandwich, or wrong type of gravy, etc), but the food is good overall, it is fast, the staff is friendly, and the \"comfort factor\" can't be beat!"}
{"text":"We have been to Market Street Diner 10+ times for breakfast and brunch.  Service and selection have always been great.  Nice family atmosphere, and last Thanksgiving I leveraged their bakery to augment cakes and pies for dessert.  

Homey and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast.  Not the ma and pop diner I expected, very clean and modern."}
{"text":"Went to Market Street Cafe with a baby for a weekend breakfast. Good place to go with kids! The breakfast food we had was very tasty--eggs cooked just as ordered (big pet peeve of mine), bacon nice and crisp. The biscuit was my fav part--it's hard to find a restaurant that makes good biscuits and while these weren't the best I've ever had they were pretty solid for a midwestern restaurant! Kinda wish I had tried the biscuits and gravy instead. We took some pieces of pie to go--coconut cream and cherry rhubarb. Just two minor complaints: the crust isn't much to write home about though it's not terrible, and the coconut cream had no whipped cream on it! It was a baked coconut custard, which was tasty but not quite what I was expecting when I ordered it. The service wasn't great--our server pretty much disappeared through the whole meal and took forever to bring the check, but I don't really go out to breakfast for the great service. Overall we thought it was a solid choice, at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to eat breakfast in the Sun Prairie, WI area that had a gluten free menu.  As one of the Food Fight Restaurant group establishments, I figured I'd give them a whirl.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered the corned beef and hash, which was excellent.  The only aspect I wasn't completely happy about was the portion/price ratio.  It was a tad expensive for the amount of food I received.  I probably should have went with the breakfast brunch for 10.99 that looked AMAZING but I wanted to be sure I was getting a gluten free meal.  I'll definitely go back, I just may ask about the portion before I order something next time.  If you can eat gluten, the bakery items are no joke..."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, and I have been here on many occasions to try breakfast, lunch and dinner offerings. Service was never very good.  I would have to say if you would like to try this diner, come in for the bakery and take it home."}
{"text":"We used MSD for caterers for my daughter's wedding (in a large tent.)  The service was awesome and the food was even better!  Apple cider chicken was what everyone got and everyone LOVED.  I highly recommend MSD for your next catering event!!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful Huevos Rancheros and a delish Red Velvet cupcake. I saw it when I walked in last week and decided to try it yesterday. It was everything I dreamed it would be. The waitress was also very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Standard diner food at standard diner prices. They've got a bunch of pies and baked goods, too. The place is a pretty good size, so they have no trouble seating large groups quickly. Market Street Diner isn't anything fantastic, but I'm glad it's here because restaurants in Sun Prairie are few and far between."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4 star diner breakfast! First of all, the service was fantastic. My husband and I came very early in the day with our 2 year old. He's at a difficult age for restaurants.. He needs constant entertainment and his attention span is short. He was given crayons and a kid's menu to color on, as well as a cup of water with a lid and a straw. Even still, he spilled his water within 5 minutes. The server was so wonderful. I was very apologetic and she said, \"we only give them as much water as we want to clean up.\" They took care of it quickly and assured us it was no big deal! This was very nice, as we already feel like an imposition!! Onto the meal itself. Coffee was hot and very acceptable by diner standards. Our son got a whole grain chocolate chip pancake and the little stinker did enjoy it very much :) My husband had biscuits and gravy, which is a meal he continues to be underwhelmed by at area breakfast spots but keeps trying anyway. I'm happy to report that he was very happy with his meal here! I had an omelette and requested an alternate cheese and they made the change for me, no problem. The omelette was good with plenty of fillings. The standout of the meal may have been the biscuit, which came as a side with my meal. Perhaps when we don't have our 2 year old forcing us to run quickly out the door we'll stay for a sweet treat. The dessert case was full of delicious looking cakes and pies!"}
{"text":"Breakfast today was underwhelming. The scrambled eggs from the bag were blah. The pattie sausage was extremely spicy. Why do pancakes have to be 1/2 inch thick? Had a seat by a window and worried that some crud would fall from the window shades onto my food."}
{"text":"We live very close by, so we frequent Market Street Diner. The food is always delicious (I normally get a scrambler, husband changes his order up). We've had excellent service every time we have gone. I've picked up breakfast on my way to work, and they had it ready so quickly! Also, the day after our wedding, we recommended our family go to Market Street. It was a rather large group - but they accommodated so well! They set up the separate room for them, and my family frequently tells me how great the service and food was. We haven't eaten much of the desserts - but it all looks delicious!"}
{"text":"Had been here several times before, the food (with the exception of desserts) was never great, but it was okay. Dinner tonight with three friends was very disappointing. I ordered a squash salad with chicken--and it came without the chicken, waitress didn't seem at all apologetic at this wrong order--the squash was tasteless, like it was out of a can, and the lettuce was very tired. No excuse for not using fresh ingredients and preparing dishes with taste--this was a $10 salad, worth about $3. Companions were similarly unenthusiastic about their meat dishes, they ruined a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. I asked for milk with my (tasteless) coffee--it never came. What's surprising is that Market St. is owned by the same people who own Monty's Blue Plate, which has excellent diner food and good service. This place should start caring about the food it prepares, and its customers. Cream pies were the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you Food Fight Inc. for opening Market Street Diner in Sun Prairie.  It's just what the doctor ordered in this sleepy, food-deprived Madison 'burb.  The menu's a bit of a mix of their Monty's and Hubbard Street diners and overall the food and the service are good.  And, the desserts are GREAT - they've got more kinds of pie than I can even begin to list."}
{"text":"So I had their Sunday brunch. The time I got there must a been a midpoint time, And they were putting out hot fresh food. Our waitress was very friendly. Very simple service. The food is always enjoyable. The only drawback are there bathrooms. They don't keep them up and they're not as clean as they should be. I know some people love their desserts but in my opinion they have much to be desired."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss sometimes with the diner. My friends and I stop in for lunch or dinner occasionally, and sometimes the food is amazing and other times its just okay. The burgers and some of the salads are safe bets for me; sometimes when I venture off those two parts of the menu, I'm sometimes disappointed. The staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful, and there's typically no wait for seating. The desserts look delectable, but sometimes fall very short."}
{"text":"Sad to see the decline of this restaurant... we used to love it for breakfast or lunch.  2 visits this month, both with the same issues, we'll NEVER be going back again.  Both times service was friendly, but exceptionally slow.  This seems to be due to the fact that there is no management, everything appears to be chaos and no processes are in place.  Restaurant was steady, but not overly busy both times.  They appeared to have enough staff, but couldn't see \"behind the scenes\".  The biggest problem is there appears to be complete chaos when the plates come out from the kitchen.  Servers huddle around, looking at plates and tickets and each other, and the food sits.  You'd think they'd realize that it's visible to the dining room, so we literally sit there and watch our food get cold on the ledge under the lamps.  Wife and I had lunch there last week, took forever and the food was cold, although someone did recognize that fact and comped one of our meals.  Since they handled the issue well, we tried it again today for breakfast, and the exact same thing happened.  None of us got hot food, and mine was flat out cold.  Sent back, server claimed it was being \"remade\" but it clearly was toyed with, nuked, and put back under the heat lamp.  Awful service, average food that apparently is never served hot, and complete disorganization.  We'll never be back, a definite \"STAY AWAY\" if you're looking for a efficient, hot breakfast."}
{"text":"The chili in his place was AMAZING! The chicken salad sandwich & Cuban was pretty good. Very pleasant staff & service!"}
{"text":"We usually have breakfast here and it's pretty good as long as you order from the menu and skip the buffet.  Dinner, on the other hand, is touch and go. Chicken on salad was warmed up instead of sautéed to order. Other items are similarly prefab. Like other Food Fight restaurants, Market Street Diner claims to source locally, but they should back that up with freshly cooked food then, otherwise it feels like Sysco. Baked goods sold at the Sun Prairie farmers market were stale so we typically avoid the bakery."}
{"text":"Wonderful adorable staff. Amazing pie. Their cheesecake was very rich and old fashioned. Everything was 50s style traditional and delicious. Loved the French onion soup and ham sandwhich, not greasy or too saucy at all. The pork soup was a medly of garden flavors with generous portions of pork. 
Give Hubbard Avenue Diner some competition."}
{"text":"Check out the bakery cases before sitting down, you might want to save your appetite.  The salads are wonderful, and ordering a half sandwich and soup will be enough for dessert."}
{"text":"Very good diner fare! 

I opted for the soup and sandwich combo - Reuben and clam chowder.  Both picks were very good, though the chowder was quite heavy on the thyme.  The Reuben was typical delicious.  

While I wanted to crawl into the pie and cake cases and eat them all - I decided to just take home a piece of the coconut cream pie.  My favorite - and it didn't disappoint!  

Service was friendly, food came out quick and hot. I'm not in sun prairie often - but I'd head back in if I'm there!"}
{"text":"Interestingly modern (and massive) structure for a traditional family restaurant/ pie diner. Great biscuits. Good place. 

I had a simple western omelet with hash browns and a biscuit. It was very good. The veggies were thick and fresh. I like to be able to taste each ingredient. I could and it was delicious. The hash browns were well done as I'd asked and the biscuit was tall and flaky. My server kept my coffee warm. 

This is an ambitious place. They have a drive through, easily 40 tables plus counter seats and a full bakery in the basement. I even liked the dichotomy of chrome and glass urban-esque construction and what appeared to be a large, original Fiestaware display along with other traditional old-timey appointments. 

The plate my breakfast was served on was a little small, making for an awkward crowd of eggs and potato's. And while I love sea salt, the granules are too large for a traditional shaker. I actually began to become self conscious about my attempts to season my food. Two minor issues. Overall a very good place."}
{"text":"It has become almost a family tradition to frequent Market Street Diner on Saturday mornings/early afternoon for their amazing brunch buffet.  Our server this past Saturday (Margharita) was very sweet and attentive, and we really appreciated her interacting with our two year old son.

Servers in the past have been hit or miss, but we had her before and I was very pleased when she introduced herself as our server."}
{"text":"What's going on food fighters?  Went for late lunch yesterday. Ordered the southwest omlet with hash browns and a biscuit. My grandson had the chicken nuggets and fries and my husband had a Belgian waffle with strawberrys and scrambled eggs and bacon. All of our food was less then luke warm. My hash browns were way over cooked and more like shoestring potatoes. The omlet was rubbery and lacked flavor. The biscuit was the best part of the meal, fresh  and moist.  My grandsons food was barely warm.  i tasted my husbands waffle. It didn't look good, light yellow and white and it tasted terrible, tough and flavorless. It almost tasted like fish batter. You could hardly cut it with a knife it was so rubbery. His eggs were also bad, tasted like leftover from Sunday buffet. He asked for bacon to be crispy and it came med well, not crispy. What a huge disappointment. We won't be back. When I eat out I go to places 1 for great food 2 great service 3 atmosphere in that order. I have been there several times and had 3 incidents. Was charged for something I didn't order, was given 2 1/2 pieces of fish when I ordered three pieces and poor service(lazy waitress couldn't clear dirty dishes off the table). Our server yesterday was pleasant but left all the dirty dishes on the table. It's not that difficult to grab some dirty dishe when you walk by.
Yesterday was the last straw. There are way too many really good restaurants to go to with great food and trained professional wait staff and cooks. It's pretty bad when you can get better food and prices at Perkins and Chilis.
I really hate giving bad reviews but I really hate getting ripped off. 
Train your wait staff and hire cooks who are experienced and cook with love."}
{"text":"When we are looking for a good family eatery at good prices, this is where we go.  The food is average and it's a single open room with little ambiance, but if you like country style food, there's something on the menu for everyone.  

And the bonus is the deserts.  You know it the moment you walk in and see the selection of pies."}
{"text":"After getting a food fight gift card, I decided to try one of the restaurants of there's that I had never been to before. This took me to the Market Street Diner in Sun Prairie. The exterior of the building is fun, and had me excited to enter, but sadly the interior is lacking. The decor is aimed at upscalish truck stop, but there's just not enough personality inside to properly make it work. Instead, its incredibly bright, but a little sad. I had the pot pie, and my friend had the cuban sandwich. Neither item was very high quality, and honestly I was expecting more. If you're looking for a barely upscale truck stop, this place is for you. Otherwise, the food is mediocre, and the decor is lacking."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. My wife always wanted to try this place, which is reminiscent of the Hubbard Street Diner in Middleton.  All of the meals hoovered at the $9 to $10 dollar mark, about $2 dollars too high. I got the Ruben, wife got big breakfast. Food was meh. Fries were soggy. Took most home and it ended up as scraps for dogs.

Service was interesting. Saturday morning waitress had a hangover, forgot our order, forgot to bring us creamer, forgot to refill water, but was extremely nice the whole time. Will hit up one of the many other restaurants in SP nest time."}
{"text":"We stopped there yesterday for b'fast lunch. The waitress seemed bored with her job. We ordered bfast,it was mediocre,my wifes food was barely warm.. Our nephew had the brunch,he thought it was good,we didn't,last time the brunch food was cold.  The waitress never came back till she showed up with the bill. She took my wifes credit card and wandered around the restaurant like she was wasting time (we could see her).   When we left we stopped at the bakery counter to buy some pie,two employees looked at us and walked the other way. ODD? 

We eat at Blue Plate And Hubbard Street. Both top notch well run places and both Foodfight."}
{"text":"Solid diner, our waitress Tracy was prompt, friendly, and completely genuine. Bloody Mary's are so very balanced - bacon, biscuits, pickles, pickled pearl onion. Legit. Garden Benedict - great concept with the pesto hollandaise and zucchini biscuit. Chicago omelet; thick homemade marinera and Italian sausage, brilliant. The hash browns could have had a little more crisp. I'll be coming again next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, no manager to fix my sloppy meal! Staff looks mad both times I've been in there. And to top it off I'm quite positive I saw a Roach. I do not recommend at all, to anyone. And an update. I went in this evening and there were cockroaches crawling on and off the counter. It's sad to see what this has come to. I'm calling the Wisconsin health department in the morning. This is horrible and I can not imagine my food covered in cockroaches. Get your shit together Food Fight!"}
{"text":"lousy service 1/2 the time my food was lukewarm at best - good pies and thats about it.  will not go back except pies - maybe.  the fact that people rave about it explains why so many businesses get away with lousy service."}
{"text":"Market Street Diner is very mod and cutesy. The food is decent diner fare, but in giant portions. Where the restaurant really shines is in its pies and desserts. I worked here for a summer when I was a teenager and thought the biscuits and sweet potato fries were pretty great. 

I would say Market Street is pretty average, as far as diners go. Not the best,  not the worst. You probably won't be disappointed, but also not enchanted or addicted and counting down the minutes until your next visit."}
{"text":"A place with a nice ambience that is kid friendly.  Meals are reasonably priced.  The quality of food is high but the preparation can be hit or miss depending on your preference.  I have had some amazing meals here and some so-so meals here.  The big draw, in my opinion, is that they also sell Carl's Cakes for desert and some decent pies."}
{"text":"Whoah, harsh reviewers, tough crowd here.

I ate at Market Street Diner for their weekend brunches, it was cheaper than place across the street (that shall remain unnamed, I don't want them to lose business, close down, and then for there not to be any \"market\" competition, oh pardon the pun!).

The brunches have all the standard stuff, but the biscuits and gravy were very nice, as well as the fruit and yogurt granola parfait. Dessert spread was eye pleasing.  We were a couple of two, and sat at the counter, where seating was immediate. 

Worth the price, and it was very crowded especially on Mother's Day brunch weekend. 

I also bought a dozen cupcakes at the annex, Carl's Bakery. Delicious!  If it weren't for my super all time favorite brunch place in Madison which I have written a review of, this place would be up there in the top 5, but the verdict is still out ..."}
{"text":"Three words- Peanut butter pie! Ah it's so good! It's my favorite pie ever! I've  also had a burger and fries, they were also good. A fun place to eat with friends and family!"}
{"text":"I've been to MSD many times in the past, and this was a notably worse experience.  Dinner on a Tuesday night - what could go wrong?  From the moment I sat down I noticed that they restaurant was notably full, but lacked sheer quantity of staff.  This could not end well.  We ordered the \"special\" burgers with fries - easy enough.  

It took a long time to get.  When we got it, I was so hungry I took a bite and realized that the burger I ordered, a Chipotle Burger Special, came out as a mushroom and swiss.  Furthermore, the fries were only luke warm.  And frankly the burger wasn't that good - of course I am not a fan of mushrooms so go figure.

We flagged down our waitress, who was overworked to begin with, and she gracefully agreed that we had the wrong burgers.  We told her we would eat them because we were on a time line, and to her credit - she came back and said they would comp the meal.  That's about the best part of the day, because the burgers weren't that good and the fries were luke warm.

Not sure what's going on over at MSD but I suggest they hire more staff - I watched a waitress who already had a full set of tables actually trying to buss tables in between.  I watched her customer's food sit in the window dying while she was cleaning up.  To the staff's credit - they were working hard - but management needs to get more people on the floor."}
{"text":"Four in our group today for lunch.  They have brunch both Saturday and Sunday until 2pm.  The other couple both did the brunch.  A few items had run out and weren't replenished.  The pastries were really dry.  My husband ordered the Western Burger and said it was okay; nothing special.  I ordered the Italian Turkey BLT with waffle fries.  Mine was very tasty.  I would order it again, however the focaccia bread left crumbs on my shirt with every bite.  Service was average until we were done eating.  It took a bit to get the last of the dishes cleared and no beverage refills after the checks were paid."}
{"text":"Service on 23rd in evening was terrible, got our food only after asking our waitress when others that arrived after us had already eaten, told us kitchen was backed up with to go orders, no way!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is almost exactly half way between our house and my brothers house in the Milwaukee area. Since I had eaten here several years ago, I thought we would try it again. My wife, brother and S.I.L had never eaten here before.
The place is great. Our server, Jason, was excellent! 
They have a great, reasonably priced menu. I'm a bit of a fussy eater and don't like a lot of foods. But their menu accommodated even ME!!
Since it way my birthday (73!!!!! Whew), I celebrated with a Burger, Fries and a Malt, just like the old days! Foods I rarely eat anymore because I am always trying to keep my weight down. And one of the best parts of my meal was the SKINLESS french fries!! Wooo wooooo, if you look at my profile, I HATE french fries with skins on them. Come on, really!, the skin is where all the VITAMINS  are??? RIGHT!!! But you will never prove to me that vitamins remain in the skins or anywhere else after a dunk in 10,000 degree oil!! (LOL)
Anyway, you won't be disappointed in the least if you eat here. Be aware, it gets crowded at lunch time, when we were there, and probably at other times. Service was still quite fast. 
There is parking all around the place, street and lot(s). There is a new building going up right across the street but does not interfere with parking at all. 
AND....not only is this a diner, but a bakery too. The glass counters right in front of you as you enter, are loaded with really kool bakery, is almost impossible to pass up!
They do serve alcohol, my wife said that her Bloody was excellent and made with a VERY popular mix. She is indeed a expert at what a good bloody should taste like!
ENJOY"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and was completly satisfied. the first time we ate in and the second time i went we just stoped for pie.  The prices are a little high.  but the pies are wonderful.. The only complaint i would have is that i had three peices of apple pie and it cost what a whole pie would have cost and they never said anything about the fact the better deal would be to get a whole pie.  we had two peices in one box and it didnt quite look like two.  but the taste of these deserts are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more.  But I just feel like it is inconsistent.  And with me, consistency is important!

I've been here probably 4 times over the last few years, each with an experience much different than the last.  Sometimes the food is great.  Other times just mediocre.  The service is typically decent.

My last visit was to get some dessert with friends, and our slices of pie/cake were tiny."}
{"text":"The good: the chicken on my spinach salad was real chicken, not that reprocessed chicken nonsense, and the pecans were freshly candied. The dried cranberries weren't plumped, but I'll give them a pass, because the rest of the salad was better than I was expecting from a diner.

The bad: the soup of the day was terrible. It was a mix of chopped and diced veggies in chicken stock. It tasted like they literally just tossed some veggies in with chicken stock, and some salt and pepper. That would have been bad enough, but, it wasn't even a proper dice; the chunks were all different sizes, so the small ones cooked faster and were soggy, and the large ones were undercooked.

The ugly: I live in such a food wasteland that I'll probably end up eating here again."}
{"text":"I thought the food was OK.  I had the fish fry on a Friday.  I would defiantly go back.  Decent food.  Friendly waitstaff.  Nothing too special, just a greesy spoon type place."}
{"text":"Super good dinner! The Chicken pot pie was amazing. Plus, you have to have a treat from the bakery before you leave. 

Very kid friendly.....my kids loved the straws for their drinks!"}
{"text":"Always have had a good experience here but today was the best. Just me and my 3.5 year old came in around 4 pm. The waitress helped me pick a meal that was easily split into two (I watch my calories) and she knew we were in a hurry (inbetween activities) and brought everything quickly and even gave us little containers to take the leftover fruit and applesauce home. Food always tastes good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Cute place though might fall a little on the overly sterile/trying too hard look, but cute nonetheless. Stopped in for lunch on Saturday with 3 other people. Our server was good. My walnut burger was given to another table by mistake, but was quickly put out by the kitchen. The burger itself was very good, clearly made in house. Wife got the chicken tenders which was a huge ordered of hand breaded chicken! Overall, I would definitely go back if I was in the area again. Didn't get a chance to have the pie, but was intrigued by many of the flavors."}
{"text":"Quick review....

Parking:  easy and close
Service:  quick, friendly
Food:  tasty

I have been hear several times and not a bad meal to report.  Parking is fairly easy in downtown Sun Prairie.

And we did save room to share a dessert...boy did that large piece of cake go fast!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!  Super-big bloody Marys, w/homemade mix, spicy, delicious!!!  The soup is TO DIE FOR!!!  The corned hash!!!  You can actually tell there are CHUNKS of corned beef!!!  All baked goods are homemade!!  The deserts!!!  YOWZA!!!"}
{"text":"We went here again because we apparently are sorely lacking in the intelligence department.  We decided to try some pie.  We got slices of apple walnut and blueberry.  How could anyone screw that up right?  Well, Market Street Diner does a fine job of creating mediocre to inedible pies.  Four years ago I came here and purchased a whole lemon meringue pie, it was horrible tasting and horribly expensive.  

Fast forward to 2012 and their pies still suck.  One of the people in our party is the kind of person who will eat AND like anything, but when I saw the screwed up look on his face after taking a bite of blueberry pie, I knew the the Earth was falling off its axis.  Deciding that perhaps he was having an off day, others of us tried some, and that's when it became apparent that somebody needs to be fired or go back to pie school ASAP.  

The apple walnut pie was better.  Of course, the bottom of my shoe is better than the blueberry pie, so that isn't saying much.  

So now, when we drive by Market Street Diner some of us hiss like vampires at the sun, others of us just make juicy vomiting noises.  

I'm fairly confident we will never go here again, that is, unless it's the last restaurant on Earth, and we've completely lost our minds."}
{"text":"I really like their roasted root veggie hash.  I get it with eggs over easy and a side of bacon (for a bit more protein).  Yummy!  Carl's Cakes is based in the same place so you can always walk out with goodies after your meal."}
{"text":"I want this review to have more stars.. but i just can't give them. 

First time we went there, what a delightful local diner. Comfortable, great service, decent food. Every other time we've been there has been a fail (5-7 times), filled with iffy food and very (very) subpar service.. Why go back? Not sure. I guess we haven't in a month or so. Much rather spend our eating out dollars and a place that rarely disappoints (Atlantis Taverna!!)"}
{"text":"The chilequuiles were delicious!
I love the atmosphere. As busy as it was on a Saturday, the service and food were wonderful! 
And I took home some cookies from Carl's...yum."}
{"text":"Had to write an update based on the service we recently had because it was just too insane.

Walked in for breakfast this last Saturday morning and it took a good five minutes for the server to greet us because she was ringing up another couple - which is totally fine.  However when she did look up, she was annoyed and said \"I'll be with you in just a minute, maam.\"  

Looks normal on paper, right?  Except this chick literally BARKED this at me - it was so over the top that the people she was helping actually turned around to look at me.  Gee, was it something I said?  I was just looking at the cakes, no big deal.  

My companions sat down to wait to get seated but I remained standing.  After the hostess was freed up she approached us and shouted \"Is there something I can help you with?\"

Um... yeah... you could, you know, do your job and seat us?  There was no wait, no one else around the area - it was just so weird and uncomfortable and hilarious.

Our waitress took our order in a timely fashion but couldn't crack a smile if you had used a crowbar on her.  Another waitress brought us our food and asked us if there was anything else we needed - to which we said yes - silverware.  It took her a good four minutes to scrounge up some silverware.  Isn't that the worst?  You sit down in front of your breakfast and it smells awesome and looks good and five minutes pass and you're sitting there like an idiot.

Also, what's up with servers \"trading out\" in the middle of a service?  That is so funny to me.  It wasn't like our waitress was off for the day - I could see her helping the table next to us.

Long story short - my poached egg was watery, it took 20 minutes to get the bill from the waitress (our original waitress who returned to pick up the cash), no one said goodbye as we left, freaky little drill sergeant hostess...  and the worst part is that I know we'll end up back at this place for breakfast.

Until Sir Hobo's opens again."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian you ABSOLUTELY can not trust their menu indicators stating the meal is vegetarian. Two of the three dinners stated as vegetarian contain cheeses that are not vegetarian. I am not talking about vegan but vegetarian.  Parm and Asiago are both made with enzymes from a calves stomach and are are the onlt two normal market cheeses that are not vegetarian  (specialty cheese are another subject).  If your veg eat at your own risk. Servers were inatentive to the point we had to get up and ask the hostess for assistance 3 times."}
{"text":"Do not get a wedding cake from Carl's. This review is based only on the service, not the product. 1 week before our wedding Carl decides he can't make the cake that we agreed on 5 months ago and tells us the flavors we had been sold on at the tasting were terrible and we should choose something else. Apparently Carl lacks the designing skills he promised us when we signed a contract and paid a deposit. The worst experience of planning this entire wedding has come with Carl's Cakes. Keep that in mind when you are shopping for a wedding cake. Wish we would have known this months ago, I suggest you book someone else."}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry. First time here first impression very clean. Server was very friendly and helpful. Order a cup veggie stew is was very tasteful. Wife and I got the 3 piece fish fry.  Fish was done to perfection. Service good but not great. But they were busy. I hope to go back and try it again. Menu is big lots of choices. Serves breakfast all day. That what I really would like to try next time. Bakery looks great when entering. Nice location great views out the window good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in Sun Prairie today and happened to drive past The Market Street Diner. I was really glad I made the decision to skip Subway and stop in here instead. I had a delicious cup of spicy Chicken Tortilla soup and an Italian BLT I might dream about tonight. It's a traditional BLT on homemade, soft warm foccacia bread with a pesto mayo. It was perfect. My only regret is I didn't save room for dessert, the Whoopie Pies looked delicious."}
{"text":"I also really wanted to like this place, we were disappointed.  The service was terrible, we waited so long for extra napkins that we had to take them from an empty neighbor table.  No refills on water, forgot my husband's shake, forgot his coke slaw, waited 10 minutes for our bill after the server asked if we wanted it.  The worst part is we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant, the waitstaff was far too into socializing to bother with us.  I gave it 3 stars bc the food was decent.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast ordered sunny side up eggs. The yolk so rock hard. Couldn't believe they sent it out. Service was pretty good.  Their cookies and cupcakes look awesome but are always hard and dry. Yuck"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy coming here, but that has definitely changed. I have come here for Sunday breakfast 3 times in the last year, and each time I am less impressed. The food is marginal compared to the other breakfast places in Sun Prairie, but the biggest downfall of the diner is the service. It typically takes 10 minutes to receive water and order drinks, 40 minutes to receive the food, and 20 minutes to get the bill after you ask for it. Also, expect the food to be between lukewarm and cold."}
{"text":"This surprising gem is in downtown Sun Prairie.  My wife and I went there for breakfast.  The staff was great.
My wife had biscuits and gravy (her regular when we go to a diner) and I had their Monte Christo.  My wife liked her dish.  I thought mine was a bit of an odd combination but I figured I'd try it.  The components were all good but I don't think they went together well.
I'd definitely go back but I'd try something else.
They also have a drive thru in the back, but I'm not sure what is available for that.  Perhaps just bakery items."}
{"text":"Good food - not a huge selection. If going for brunch, order off the menu instead of the buffet. Sunday special (pot roast) is good. Good children's menu. A dollar or two over priced.

Excellent selection of cakes and pies - and they are quite good too."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a few times. Service was a little slow a few times. They have a decent menu. Parking can be difficult during busy times."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here.  It was very clean and the people were friendly.  It seemed like a great place to bring kids.  The deserts at the front counter looked very good.  
I ordered corned beef hash with scrambled eggs.  Everything was average.  I tried my sons pancakes and they were also average.
I would like to come back to try dessert."}
{"text":"Fast service, could have been a little friendlier. Food is great every time! And you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"Went there once and they screwed up my order TWICE in one time. So we gave it another chance and it wasn't bad but my date hated it. Then the next time my coffee was really bad. The next time they said one particular dish was gluten-free but was not and had to take it back. The waiter didn't even know if it was or not but said that it wasn't not knowing the possibilities of a gluten-intolerance person eating a gluten meal!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids for a nice meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner or even a sweet treat when out for a walk. Staff was great and actually interacted with my boys (1yr & 3yr) whom were making a mess. Waiter received nice tip for the extra effort too. 

BBQ sandwich rocks and their cornbread is pretty good too. Homemade milkshakes, pies, and big a**, ice cream-filled cookies top out my highlights of Market Street Diner."}
{"text":"As with other reviews, MSD offers a large menu of solid comfort food items. Decor is fun but upon closer inspection the tables, booths and floors are all tired, with scuffs and chips galore. Food was good, but was very average. Service was also ok and felt a little uninspired. All in all, there's something to please anyone here, but it won't be memorable."}
{"text":"Had a really nice breakfast here!!! The Bloody Mary was very good and the biscuits and gravy were quite tasty. They offer a great breakfast menu along with a decent size lunch menu. It's a very cute restaurant. They have a pastry counter with some of the most amazing sweet treats I have ever seen. Can't wait to go back and have lunch with a delicious dessert!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Market Street Diner for the first time yesterday. My husband had the Black and Blue Hamburger and I had the Farmers Scrambler and pancakes. 

The burger toppings were tasty but they overpowered the meat so he couldn't tell if it was good or bad meat. The patty was rather thin. The waffle fries were great. 

The scrambler was good...the hash browns were crisp a had a great flavor. I think the sausage tasted sorta like brown and serve but I'm not sure. Pancakes were good...like I make from scratch at home. 

We bought a chocolate cupcake and french silk pie slice to take home. The cupcake was nothing special...a little dry. The pie crust reminded me of the frozen stuff you buy at the grocery store....very lackluster. 

We'll go back and try a few more things on the menu."}
{"text":"pancakes were reasonably light and flavorful and the eggs(SS) were cooked well--also had the skillet scramble special of the day which was nicely done---alll the components were tasty and came together well

Our favorite breakfast stop when in the area!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My first visit was unspectacular, but showed that there could be potential.  So I returned to get some pie and regret it.  The surrounding area has other options and it would be pointless to waste time here.

We began by asking what pies were available (obviously).  After giving us a partial list and saying that there was more, our server was done. We asked several questions about what the other ones were and she kept saying that she didn't know.  I ended up just ordering French Silk as she named it and my fiance got the Chocolate Ganache cheesecake instead.  I also ordered an espresso drink, German Chocolate Mocha.

A few minutes go by and our server returns, stating that they didn't have any French Silk pie. I asked again about the other options and she still didn't know.  I really should have just left here, but I really wanted pie so I reluctantly ordered the Oreo.  Another 5 minutes or more go by and she returns again.  This time to say that they don't have the syrups to make the espresso that I ordered.  Yet again, I should have just left.  I cancelled the drink.  We waited another 5 minutes and were then brought our desserts.  

The cheesecake was actually pretty good.  We ended up sharing it as my pie was not edible.  On the plate was a partial slice of pie with what I can only believe were pan scrapings next to it to make it actually large enough.  I took one bite of the mangled mess and was done.  It tasted as if it had been in a cooler, uncovered, for days.

When the server returned and asked if I wanted to take it with me, I replied with, \"No, it was disgusting.\"  She then left and we waited for 12 minutes for a bill.  Upon checking out, we were asked how it was.  I said it was \"bad\", detailed what happened, and pointed out the nearly entire piece of pie still sitting on the table.  The cashier apologized and promptly charged me for both desserts.

I left very unhappy.  But, again, I really wanted to like this place and I've been a huge supporter of Food Fight for years.  With that, I wrote a very detailed message to there general and management emails.  I even provided a picture of the pie that I couldn't eat.  It has now been over one week and they haven't even responded.  Having done far more than most to give them the opportunity to salvage this horrendous experience, I have given up."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food is very good, but the cake...... Well in my opinion is unbelievably good. The atmosphere is great. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Have had decent experiences here but always over priced. I ordered biscuits&gravy & half a ruben. The ruben was soggy at the bottom and the biscuits and gravy where hot on the middle and freezing on the outside. I dont kno if this is the chefs cooking order or the waitress timing but eitherway I paid $30 for a terrible meal. When told these issues the waitress informed me she would talk to management she quickly came back and offered me another plate of biscuits and gravy. I declined and told her to inform the chef microwaved biscuits taste horrible. 
ONLY GO FOR CARLS CAKES"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place to go for dinner. We actually came here for her birthday so she could get her free cake! I can't even mention it as an option with other choices because she loves it so much. I've never had a bad meal here and almost always have to have dessert. I like that they serve beer as well. It just gives it that little bit extra to boost it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Everyone has that thing that they look for on a menu...I look for a Monte Cristo.  I came to Market Street Diner with the plan to have a sandwich and soup, and maybe a piece of pie.

I walk in and it is got a modest business going at 2 pm on Derby Day.  I am told to seat myself.  I sit and a menu is placed before me.  There are two or three wait staff on the floor.  Like any of these Diners under Food Fight, there are a lot of choices on the menu.  I see the Monte Cristo on the menu but I don't read the description thoroughly.  I look at the sandwiches but now I can't stop thinking about the Monty Cristo.  I order it without looking further at the menu.  My server asks if I want the egg sunny side up.  I say sure but again I had a different idea where the egg was going to be placed.

While I'm waiting, I am enjoying my magazine and looking at the dessert menu.  I start thinking about if I want a piece of pie or cake after my meal.  Dreaming...  

The Sandwich comes out.  It is a nice size and is served with hash browns on the side.   The sunny side up egg is on the top.  This is fine.  No problem.  I am not seeing the jam on the side.  I take a bite and the whole lower part of the sandwich is covered in this thick blackberry jam.  Now the jam is good but it totally overwhelms the sandwich.  It is all I am tasting.  I have so much sugar on this sandwich, I stop eating after half.  I have lost my appetite for pie.  If I was a server there, I probably would verify that it is okay that the jam is not on the side but one the sandwich.  If I ever try this MC again, I will ask for the jam on the side.

Server is friendly and checks on me frequently.  The place is nice and looks like it can take a busy Sunday brunch or a full evening.  It's a nice location and nice for groups.  I am sure I will be back but maybe not for the Monte Cristo."}
{"text":"Great place!  Myself, my mom and two friends at here last weekend and all of us were very pleased.  The ambiance is a lot of fun.  It's like a 50's diner, but isn't too hokey.  Despite the fact we came on a mid Saturday morning, it wasn't too packed.  

Our waitress was great.  Very friendly and patient as we took a little extra time to make our decisions.  

Everyone loved their food choices.  I had the two eggs with bacon and instead of hash browns I asked for a side of fruit.  I also asked for a cup of hot tea and was presented with several options (green, black, flavored, etc) to choose from.

My mom had the breakfast sandwich that consisted of basically an omelet on a biscuit.  It was huge and full of cheese.  The eggs also came with two pieces of crispy bacon on top.  It was served with a side of hash browns.  My mom shared with me as there was more than enough.  They were fantastic.

One of our friends had the vegetarian eggs Benedict and said it was outstanding.  Our other friend had the farmers scramble (I think) and also said it was very good.

Prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food that you get.

It appears they have a bakery.  All the pies and sweets I saw looked delectable.

They also serve lunch and dinner and it appears they have wine and beer available.  I wish I lived closer!  Its worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to bring your (grand)parents when they are visiting from out of town and they want something that is easily recognizable but maybe with a little bit of a twist. 

An All-American diner that is not afraid to go maybe a step or two in a creative direction but nevertheless it is definitely more in the traditional side but still fun & pleasing. 

Owned by the same people that have Monty's Blue Plate diner in the Eastside of Madison, this place is an expanded location where they do a lot of their cakes and catering business so it has a much more open feel to it, in a newer building but with the same kind of feel and attitude as Monty's.

We ordered a half sheet pan cake of the Red Velvet cake and it was delicious! The crumb was moist and tender and the frosting not too sweet, perfectly executed; the plus side was that we could pick it up in town at Monty's."}
{"text":"We visited the diner on a Saturday at 5:45.  It was incredibly busy for being so early in the evening, but we were seated immediately which was nice.  Our server was prompt and knowledgeable of the menu.  Unfortunately, the experience went downhill from there.  Our food took almost 50 minutes to arrive - we had four orders and nothing complicated about them.  Our food was room temperature, and honestly, quite a disappointment.  I got the root vegetable hash with eggs and rye toast.  The toast had obviously been sitting there for ages - it was room temperature, and the obscene amount of butter that had drenched the bottom piece.  The eggs were room temperature, and I had asked for them over-easy but they were cooked almost all the way through.  The hash was incredibly bland and cold, and there wasn't a lot of it.  For something that includes parsnips, carrots, etc it really should have had more flavor, but I think the majority of it was potatoes.  Had we had time I would have reordered, but we were trying to make it to a movie.

Our server and the manager of the restaurant were exceptionally understanding and were aware of the issues before we even mentioned them.  On the one hand, that's great that they're so attentive; on the other hand, the fact that they were aware of them without us having to bring it up and steeply discounted our experience makes me think that this is a common occurrence.  I'm afraid we won't be going back there.  It really should only have one star, but I'm adding the extra star for how well their server and manager handled the situation."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, it's local, it's cute and mod, it has drive through coffee and bakery items in the morning. But, what it comes down to is the very low quality of ingredients used in most dishes.

Chicken, hands down the cheapest T brand one can buy, and one can taste. Baked chicken has the very obvious stink of the ingredient, I can't even hold down one bite.

Fish, taste like W brand cheap fish thawed at room temperature instead of fridge. The bad taste doesn't go away even when coated and fried. I would stay away from all fish dishes.

Pancakes, I don't know how one can make a bad tasting pancake, but Market diner's pancakes are dense, no fluff, with taste of too much baking soda.

Breakfast buffet, it's about $10 per person, with selection of about 10 dishes, and super tiny cut down pieces of their various bakery items. Not worth the money.

Bakery items, I'm sorry but the Carl's Cakes items aren't that good. Carrot cakes and certain muffins are made with frosting instead of cream cheese. One can taste there are real sugar and cream in the ingredient, but the diner decide to cheap out and also mix in the artificial stuff, creating a level of dessert that above typical grocery store level bakery goods, but no where comparable to real bakery or any premium grocery bakery goods.

Sandwiches, burgers and salads are good enough, especially salad portions are very large.

All and all I'm not expecting a diner to buy the most fresh and expensive ingredients out there, but there has to be a minimum level of quality, and the cooks need to learn to compensate low quality taste with flavors."}
{"text":"This is your standard diner experience. They have a large menu with a lot of options. Lots of comfort food and great breakfast options. 

I had their chicken tenders with waffle fries. The tenders were fresh and tasted great. They were kind of small and I only got 3 of them, which was disappointing. Their waffle fries were crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times.  Each time, I leave unimpressed.  It feels like it's trying to hard to be a good, upper-class diner, and it just isn't.  I'd much rather go to Sir Hobo's or Gus's if I'm in the mood for diner eats in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"Market Street has never disappointed me. Their food is always perfection and the wait staff is on their A-Game. It has an extensive menu that caters for all tastes (breakfast, lunch and dinner) as well as some fabulous desserts. Their milkshakes, pies and cakes never disappoint. We frequently come in just to buy some of Carls red velvet cupcakes which are exquisite. I'm happy that this place is just down the road from me, I will keep coming here for awhile"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had an overall good experience. The fist time we visited was a Sunday morning. I don't need to tell you it was busy. However, between waiting for our table, and then waiting for our food it was over an hour. The waitress, who also had a trainee, was extremely apologetic. I got the impression that this was out of the norm and she felt terrible. She brought us a complimentary morning bun to tide the kids over. When all was said and done she took 50% off our ticket, which we appreciate!
The food was good, hence the 4 out of 5 stars. I tried the Italian omelet and it had a really great savory balance. The hashbrowns were a little flavorless and werent crispy. Thats what made me wonder if their kitchen problems that day were chef related.
Overall the food and service was fine. The prices are a bit higher than other diners I've been to.
My second visit was just for dessert. It was phenomenal. The slice of cake was so big I brought home leftovers! My friend loved her strawberry rhubarb pie a la mode :)"}
{"text":"The pies are very tasty but mine had fungus in it and it also had a tiny hair in it. Also the portioning of pies was very less as compared to the monty's blue plate dinner as they get their pies from market street diner only. Really disappointed because of the fungus, I sure will try and give them another chance as maybe I got the bad piece of the pie. I hope this doesn't happen with anyone else."}
{"text":"Of the list of restaurants in the Food Fight Corporation, the one is one of the worst.  Service was slow.  Food quality suffers.  We used to go to buy gluten free pies there but they discontinued that."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and sometimes the food is good and other times it's just okay. The servers are usually very friendly and attentive. Overall this is one of the better restaurants in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"My daughter and I both had the Walnut burger.  Burger was fine but with the bakery within the diner would have expected a better bun.  Also needed a little sauce of some kind.  Clam chowder was okay, nothing outstanding.  Also had chicken salad sandwich.  Lots chicken salad!!"}
{"text":"Desserts and pastries are amazing. The baker knows his stuff. As for Market st. I don't get it. I never will. It is a miserably failed attempt at grandmas kitchen. Big swing and a miss. Also potatoes are a starchy food they need lots of salt. Turkey is a grainy protein that needs just a little bit of salt to pull out the flavor and stop heating the turkey up on the darn griddle your killing it. It gets dryer every time I go. Just an FYI guys you're doing it backwards. But like the rest of us I will be back for some pie and probably choke down some grub when I return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day with a coworker. We beat the lunch rush for sure, as the place was practically empty. By the time we were leaving, though, it was really filling up! 

The menu here has so many delicious sounding meals, it really makes it hard to choose! After pondering for quite a bit, I finally decided on Chicken and Waffles. My coworker went with the Farmer's Market Rosti. 

Both of our dishes looked amazing. I had actually never had Chicken and Waffles so I was really excited to try mine. Hers also looked like something I would like to try in the future. 

The waffles part of my chicken and waffles were delish. They were cooked perfectly, came with the most delicious vanilla brandy butter (albeit WAY too much butter) and really soaked up the syrup just right. Unfortunately, the chicken missed the mark. It was basically flavorless. It really did *look* good, but even paired with the waffles and doused in syrup it just wasn't appetizing. I ended up eating all the waffles and leaving two pieces of the chicken on my plate. 

We finished off our lunch with some cupcakes to go. I got a vanilla cupcake with a raspberry filling and vanilla frosting. It was super yummy. The frosting was lighter than most cupcake frosting tends to be, and I really liked that."}
