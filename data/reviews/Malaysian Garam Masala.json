{"text":"This place is amazing. I am always on the hunt for places that people don't know about which are awesome. This is exactly that. They serve liquor as well as food. Make no mistake , it is a hole in the wall joint with tacky decor and seating. But the people that work there are hardworking and very nice. The prices are very good and the beer is 3.50 for domestic. Things to try : Chicken Kotthu Roti($7) is so good. Also make sure to get the Fish Pakora(huge box for like 9 bucks) and get the sauces with it. You will not regret going to this place if you want a mix of Malaysian, South Indian food."}
{"text":"After a long day of running errands, I was in Markham meeting up with some friends and wanted something spicy to eat. My friends recommended this restaurant and referred to it as \"a hole in the wall\". I didn't think they were being serious but as we walked in there... I was appalled at how outdated this place looked. I just stopped for a moment..Eww. This place was clean but I wonder who picked out that wallpaper and those hideous looking chairs, ahhh.  Anyway, I assume they cater, since I waited in front of cash and watched the lady frantically running around, trying to get orders out the door. So the ordering system here isn't like most restaurants, don't recommend this place for a first date haha. This is how it worked: get in line, go through the menu and order at the front, take a seat (if your dining in) and after your done eating, pay up at cash, there is no need to tip if  you happen to do all the work. Okay the best part, I ordered the hot and sour seafood soup to start, chilli chicken (asked for extra spicy) and spicy shrimp/ chicken red noodle. I grabbed a bottle of Heineken like everyone else, to \"prepare\" myself for the spice level, supposedly my friends think it helps with the digestion part. Where do people come up with these theories haha! The beer didn't help so I stuck to my 4 glasses of water.. that theory doesn't work on me! The food came out fast and the first thing that came out was the soup, it didn't look so visually appealing, maybe due to the ugly fluorescent lighting. It made everything look old and washed out and that floral granny panties wallpaper..eugh.. still did a great job irritating me the whole evening. Once I had the first spoonful of soup, it was delicious.. I really enjoyed the texture and spicyness. After wiping my forehead a couple of time and giving my tastebuds a 5 minute spice break, the noodle and chilli chicken both came out together. The dry chilli chicken went perfectly with the noodles. In between every bite I was chugging down water, my mouth was on fire! I think at one point my mouth went numb ha! I really enjoyed the spicy food here and crave it more now. I need to go back ...with an interior decorator! But also I would like to try the other 50 thing on the menu. Want to break out in a real sweat? Forget the gym and try this place ;)"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall-type restaurant, but the food is good. Ordered a mee goreng Chicken (noodle, hot) and nasi goreng Chicken (rice, hot). Taste was very good, hot, very flavourful, and complex. Lady was very nice, and helped me with the menu. The place is very informal, like a family living room, with diners helping themselves to glasses and water. Some diners go to the kitchen and have a conversation with the cook. I liked the informality.  If you are looking for ambiance, this is not it. Melamine tables, simple chairs, but clean. Restaurant is longish and narrow, like a bowling alley. Simple, low rent but flavourful food. Right beside the restaurant is a busy KTV. They close at 1:00am, I went at night, their main restaurant sign was off but had a flashing sign in the window. Cash or debit, no credit cards. I will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Summary: good portion size, good price, and solid homemade quality make this family run restaurant a constant for locals despite the long wait times, drabby looking decor/location  What I've Got: Garam Chicken Masala, roti, shrimp noodles, mutton roll, roti, kothu roti (mutton, vegetarian) What I Liked: KOTHU ROTI. Mutton roll was alright What I Didn't: garam chicken masala What I'll Get Next: kothu roti  This restaurant is located a stone's throw from Woodside square, in the bleaker looking plaza. Looks can be deceiving, though: while this doesn't scream out \"family friendly\", it's got a great following and with good reason.  The food is good, and the value is really solid.  Service? Well, they're understaffed. Wait times? Not great - they're understaffed. Decor? Bare bones BUT THE KOTHU ROTI? On point.  DON'T COME HUNGRY. Expect to wait 20-30 minutes after ordering for the food. We came on a Sunday evening around 8:30 pm and got two kothu roti dishes. It took over half an hour,  although there were about 8 tables/12 people and only two staff (including one chef)  But once the food got there, I was one happy camper. Kothu roti for both the vegetarian and mutton options were REALLY good. Tasty mix of bread with sufficient meat.  Mild is actually mild, and probably my favourite amount of spice, properly done, in a kothu dish that I've had (other places make mild taste like nothing, or make it taste like Armageddon).  The mutton rolls and roti at $1 a piece are fun to try, but aren't particularly special. Shrimp noodles were okay.  They take credit AND they stay open late.  All in all, a really solid kothu roti place - and more to try on the menu."}
{"text":"This past Sunday, I made the very snowy trek up into north Scarborough to try some Malaysian food at Malaysian Garam Masala. It is definitely out-of-the-way, in a small strip plaza in a residential area near to Woodside Square (coincidentally not far from where I went to high school back when the area was REALLY out-of-the-way). As other reviews have noted, the place is not much to look at, about a dozen green tables with flowery wallpaper and a few panes of mirror, and a serving counter at the back where you place your order. But it is very clean and bright, and the service was very attentive. Admittedly, there were only a few other people dining-in, and some others who came for pick-up, but this was not bad considering the very bad weather at the time.  After browsing the menu and asking a few questions, I ordered the Malaysian fried rice with chicken and the Garam Masala fish. The fried rice was excellent, spicy but I still added some of the hot sauce provided on the side. There was also lots of it, a large plate piled high with a fair bit of chicken mixed in; this certainly could have been a filling meal on its own. The fish was also pretty good, but not a standout like the rice. The rest of the menu has different varieties of chicken, beef, fish, shrimp, rice and noodle dishes and several types of roti. A meeting of Indian and Chinese styles, similar to the hakka restaurants that are popular now.  With one $4 beer, my bill came to only $21, and I had enough leftover to take to work for lunch. Definitely a strong recommendation; great food for a low price. I will most certainly be returning to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Best food for the price, for under $10 you will receive the best meal. The owners are extremely nice aswell."}
{"text":"At first glance it might not look like much but Malaysian Garam Masala (or \"Sankees\", as some of the locals call it) serves some of the best food in the area at a very reasonable price. Whenever you're here, ask for the Johnny Wrap. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It looks sketch at first, but it's definitely a good place for cheap eats. You can get a good meal for under $10.  I've only tried one item on the menu, but have had friends who come here late at night and truly enjoy it. Worth the try!  I tried the Mee Goreng, which is simply seafood noodles. I really enjoyed it, but was different than the traditional dish. There was more chicken than seafood, which was strange. However, the meal was still good.   My reasoning for three stars, is the meals only taste so good because of its price. I know you know those ones, where you can't be mad at the food when the price is so cheap. However, if the price was put aside the food is just good, not amazing."}
