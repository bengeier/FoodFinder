{"text":"Great Caribbean food in a business park in Mississagua, who'd a thunk it?  But there we were, picking up the wife's car from Techmax, when we saw the open sign.

Glad we went in.  Delicious, perfectly fried chicken wings in a sticky honey garlic sauce, and fried shark to start.  Yes, fried shark.  Pretty darn good as is, but even better with a squirt of lemon juice or some of the house-made hot sauce if you're brave enough.

We got oxtail stew and jerk chicken.  Both awesome, juicy and just spicy enough.  With enough sauce to put onto the rice or rice and beans.

The best parts?  Everything's made by hand.  And they're super friendly.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood for auto repair and was lunch so decided to pick up something from this as restaurant as it was walking distance this seemed a good option. 

Lunch time had just started so only a few people inside. There is a dance floor and some DJ equipment in restaurant so I guess at night it's place people come to have a good time. 

Ordered a Channa Roti with paratha as the layer rather than the stuffed daal roti. Requested to make it hot. There are some Caribbean style Chinese dishes on the menu which were tempting. 

Got asked if I need a large or a small. The menu did not say anything about two sizes. Ordered a large and requested again to make it hot. 

The size did not seem large. The filling flavourful the paratha perfect. The spice level was not even mild!!! Big disappointment-not sure if this was considered hot (it cannot be, its Jamaican!) or the order was conveyed to the kitchen. 

The price of $7 all included was a good price point. But so disappointed as I was really looking forward for something spicy."}
{"text":"The food is good. It sucks that it had hard parking. 
We waited a bit for the rice and peas. But it was worth the wait! Jerk chicken was good!!"}
{"text":"The food is good  , but the service is rude.

 I'm not talking about the waitress 's , but the guy ( owner  ).

Never says  hi , keeps staring as if you just landed from Mars .

My work is close to them  , like a 5 minute drive, but haven't been there in a long time  , just because every time I think of the place  , it reminds me of my past UNWELCOME experiences....that's how they make you feel.

 And I always used to pay cash."}
{"text":"I've been for lunch on a few occasions. Roti has been very good, service is fast and prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality :( 

The first time we had the jerk chicken, the chicken was juicy but lacking jerk spice.

The second time we had their jerk chicken, the chicken was still lacking jerk spice and this time overcooked. The chicken thigh and drumstick was chewy and dry which was unfortunate. They must have left the meat cooking for too long.

Needless to say, we won't be back. We really want a good jerk chicken in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This place is just straight out good. Food is tasty and always fresh! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"went for lunch today, ordered goat curry with roti. Was $5.49 with a drink! Was not as spicy as I thought but, their hot sauce did the trick. The way they prepared it, wrapped in roti was amazing. I would def. eat here again. I must try the other dishes."}
