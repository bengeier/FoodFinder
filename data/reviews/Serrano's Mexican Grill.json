{"text":"Initially came here from Groupon and pleasantly surprised by the great food. We have tried many dishes in different occasions and everything is usually on point. 

My personal favorite is the steak taco salad. 

Their salsa bar has lots of delicious options and even sour cream, which most places charge excessively for. Love this about them! 

The staff have always been nice."}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants, the chicken tortilla soup and the steak fajitas burrito are the best, but this time I came for the tacos.

The staff is always nice, they are awesome, and always checking everything is ok at the table. 

Not a very fancy restaurant, but I highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great tacos for the price. Carnitas and chicken were my favorite. I'd recommend the chicken tortilla soup as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. I love their street tacos and burritos, my husband loves their tortas, tacos and cuban sandwich. nice to have a new good mexican place close by."}
{"text":"Serrano's is definitely on point!  We have been driving by, anticipating the opening for weeks.  In reading up on the establishment, it appears that it's location number 2. The original is in Alaska.

We practically ordered everything, just so we could really get a great feel of their flavors.  Upon ordering the staff was great and attentive.  You order at the front counter, but it's not really fast food.  They make it to order and you can chill in the restaurant and watch the game on one of there TV's.  

We started with some ceviche which was made with mahi mahi.  It was good (not as good as my boos secret recipe, but still good).  We dove head first into the salsa bar where we fell in love.  There are a lot of great choices, some super hot, others with superb flavor.  All very good.  I had the chicken enchiladas with a red sauce.  Super fresh, not greasy... So tasty.  Their rice and beans were fantastic, too.  I also had an adobada taco which packed some heat and was really delicious.  

I'm excited about this place, especially since they will soon have beer. Go here!"}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic Mexican food!!! If you haven't tried you probably should. There Chipotle shrimp burrito was delicious. My boyfriend and I love this place!! Yumm..."}
{"text":"Nice little place. I went for lunch and had chicken and pork street tacos, rice and beans. Tacos were quite tasty and the beans and rice were good. Rice seemed a step up from the typical side you see at Mexican cafes. They have a nice selection of salsas at the salsa bar which were quite good. Real plates and silverware. A good choice for lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Wow! I've grown up in/around the Green Valley area, so when we pulled up and saw that this place was what used to be a Taco Bell, I admit I lowered my expectations. Inside, the decor was a pleasant surprise, pretty nice cover up for the old Taco Bell. Ordering was nice, preparation of our food was very fast too! (Update: perhaps my memory isn't what I thought it was... I've been reminded that this location used to be a Del Taco, not Taco Bell; not that it matters. The food was great, and I've already been back once with the rest of my family!)
The food:  my wife and I both, within just a couple bites, immediately agreed that we'd be back for sure! My Serrano's burrito was fantastic, the salsa bar only made it better.
In short, like I said, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Definitely doing it right here. Salsa bar is amazing.  Loved the creamy cilantro sauce. Huge portions, fresh, tasty.  Chipolte has nothing on these guys."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place this food is very fresh and very good they don't serve it to you 2 minutes after you order it they actually cook it fresh I believe it's a fair price for a very good meal.  If you're looking for a good south of the border - I tell you give it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Serrano's last night because the reviews sounded very good.

I have to start out by saying that everything was very good except the meat was over salted.  I had the carnitas plate and my husband had the Serrano chicken burrito.  Both meats were very salty and they could have cut the salt by half.  If someone likes that much salt they can always add it at the table.

The rest of the meal was very good.  The salsa bar, the guacamole, the real plates that were hot when they were delivered to the table.  Much better than a usual fast food place.

Of course, over salty meat is just not pleasant or delicious to eat so we more than likely won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised. They have the best salsa bar I have ever had. The food was fresh and ingredients were superb. I had the shrimp burrito which was amazing...Shrimp were huge! We don't live in Henderson but we will definitely come back to this place when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"We come here anytime we are craving Mexican food, and for the most part we love it and the service is always good, and the staff is always pleasant. I normally get tacos and the taco salad, but my boyfriend really likes the Serrano burrito, but everything is always good and fresh. I also like that they have homemade sauces and sour cream in the salsa bar so I'm never limited. I really would recommend anyone to try this place out and give it a chance."}
{"text":"Yes exactly this place is as good as it gets.
So last night 01/27/2016 I entered this restaurant with zero expectations.
Everything was pretty much under $9.
Our order came pretty quick. And the moment I took first bite of serrano burrito, my taste buds started dancing. Even simple rice was delicious.
I eat out very rarely because I cook very good food and I am hard to get impressed.
But this place I am going back again. And never going back to Nacho Daddy. For last 2 years until  last night it was Nacho Daddy my choice of mexican restaurant .
Not anymore :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great & friendly service. Will be going back today (for the second time this week )."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak burrito. Wasn't too pleased. Tortilla was a bit stale. Steak tasted good but nothing else had any flavor. I'd recommend chipotle over this any day"}
{"text":"This place was okay. Food is not bad. Customer service could be a bit better. I asked to use the 20% off coupon they had on yelp but was told I had to leave a nice review before they would honor the coupon. I explained to the cashier that i would be happy to leave a review after trying the food but she insisted that I leave the review prior to trying the food. I declined and the cashier refused to honor the coupon. I will not be returning to this place because the food was just okay."}
{"text":"I tried this plave once before, it ok, nothing special. I was in the atea today, i figured I'd get a couple of street tacos (on avg about 2 bux a taco). I ordered a shrimp taco and a mahi taco with a drink. The lady at the counter did not explain what was on the tacos, she just said \"with everything, yeah?\". So i asked what is everything, she sighed and spouted of ingredients, sure with everything. (by this time, its pretty obvious i dont know the menu). I got my drink and went to sit at a table she just \"cleaned\", as soon as i put my hands on the table it was super sticky, i just wiped it down with a napkin, and had to keep a napkin on the table to prevent from sticking to it.
She comes over with the 2 tacos, i asked \"oh, no beans or rice?\" Her response was \"oh thats $2.49 extra\" and walked away... Ummm ok... 

Needless to say the sevice was less than par. 
This is my 2nd time here, i will give them 1 more try, but very leary, as they really left me with a nad feeling."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The Fajita burrito and original burrito were both excellent! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Friendly service.
Always fresh food. You will smile after ypur first bite"}
{"text":"Wow, surprising you'd think from the looks of it that it was a fast food joint when in fact the decor was well done within. Get the Fajita Burrito #boom. Nachos are bomb as we'll!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Service could have been better. The cashier guy was clearly uninterested and wasn't much help in clarifying nor answering... Just mumbled and made the ordering process blah and disappointing! 

However the food more than made up for it!!! Exceptionally tasty for a quick meal! Amazingly quick Mexican food! One of the best and tastiest fast Mexican food eateries I've ever had in the south and west!!

Highly recommend the chicken tortilla soup, the chicken enchilada suizas and the chicken tacos!! Delicious!! 

PS: the same guy was much better with his service. So more than happy at the end!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant, prompt service and nothing on the menu has disappointed yet. I particularly recommend the tortas. Portions are big enough for a large guy like me. Salsa bar has lots of choices. More expensive than Taco Bell or Roberto's by a couple bucks but the quality is much higher."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Henderson. First time here and won't be the last."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  This is in a former fast food restaurant.  It's been remodeled a bit and it's just adorable.  We had a Groupon and I would go a million times over with no discount!! Spectacular food.  We had the guacamole and it was superb.  Fresh and flavorful, really great.  We had combo plates, and there was just not one thing to complain about.  It was all so good.  I cannot wait to go back.  Everyone was really friendly too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was a 6 on a scale of 5 but the dinning area was :-( fast food.
PLEASE move to a real dine-in building and we will be there every week!
The best tortilla soup I ever had!
One other thing is portions are usually large in a Mex Rest, but not here. we ate well for $45."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food the last time I was here so I'm returning a second time for the delicious salmon tacos"}
{"text":"I have officially made this my go to place for authentic Mexican food!  Let's first start with the cleanliness and openness of the restaurant. It has plenty of space with beautiful creative decor.  The salsa bar alone puts every other Mexican restaurant to shame! Not only do they have several salsas to choose from, but they also have sour cream and the tamitio quac salsa as well. I could never leave out the fact that they pickle their own jalapeño and habenero,and it is so tasty! 

Now to the food!  The best of the best of this review! I had the carnitas and a Carne Asada burrito, both of which was very delicious. The Carne Asada taste like it came right off the grill!  The carnitas was flavorful and juicy add well as the Carne Asada. The beans and rice were spot on delicious!  I love the open spacious kitchen. They serve coke products which is a plus plus for me! Lol

Now the staff, they are so accommodating and have your food to you so promptly. So if you are ever on a lunch break and want quality food served at a convenient time, then this is your place. 

Now the great part of this restaurant is accommodation like I mention earlier right! ? Well in the valpak coupon mailer you can find a coupon for buy one burrito get the other free!  Now that's amazing and I appreciate that a lot. 

So if you are ever in the area and you want to enjoy Mexican food and atmosphere try Serranos. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is so close to my house. The food is the best. Especially the steak fajita burrito. Try it asap"}
{"text":"I went off reviews and was disappointed an order of chic nachos...a steak taco n cheesecake they had no cheesecake got home and taco no flavor at all bland the nachos chicken had a funky taste to it. I would not recommend this place save your money go next door to del taco get the del taco or nachos least they got flavor. The salsa bar was dirty and red salsa all had just a tomato taste."}
{"text":"Really good food fabulous every time friendly staff and prompt service definitely recommend for all mexi food lovers"}
{"text":"Update... DONT GO HERE. They give you salsa that's old, and smells gross. I sat the salsas on my table and all of the tops just blew off, I kept recapping them and they plastic would expand...... no wonder why this place is always slow. Also when my mom opened her food... all of a sudden there was a fruit fly. Gross"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant on this side of town. I've never had a bad experience. The team here is friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable. The inside decor is up to date and down right cute. With an open kitchen concept, you can see that everything is made fresh. It lacks a functioning drive through but if you call ahead they will walk your food to you. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"This is fast food mexican, but very very good.   I had the burrito, which comes with Mexican rice and refried beans.   Very very good.   The wife had enchiladas with red sauce and that was fantastic. 

They have a serve yourself salsa bar, with sour cream on the bar.  I'm a big sour cream fan when it comes to Mexican,  so this was a major major plus for me. 

Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want yummy Mexican food, but you don't want to spend a whole lot of money. They seem to have quite a few choices on their menu. I will say that I don't like that the menu is written out on a board with no photos. However, the drive-thru has photos so you get a better idea of what you will be getting for each meal. There was a Specials sign that had some pretty great deals for $5.99, such as a burrito with rice and beans + a drink or two tacos with rice and beans + a drink. I got the burrito plate with what I think was hibiscus lemonade (there was no label). The special came with a pretty large burrito and a generous portion of rice and beans. Needless to say, I was not able to finish the whole meal! The burrito itself was delicious! I included a photo (partially eaten - I couldn't wait! I was famished.) The employees seemed very nice, and the establishment was mostly clean. The tables were a bit dirty, and the women's restroom needed soap and a good cleaning. Other than those things, I think this is a great place if you're in the mood for an authentic Mexican dish."}
{"text":"First time here I was a bit skeptical because it was empty,  can't imagine this being the case for much longer. Clean, Decorative style is fresh modern and fun! Tortilla soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"Super delicious and clean!! Nice staff and fair prices. Great tasting burrito and their torta was awesome too. We got free re-fills on the horchata! I like that they don't use foam silverware and the other aguas frescas were really good too!"}
{"text":"Now this is authentic fresh Mexican food!! I felt as if I was on vacation in Mexico. The salsas are spicy and the food was amazing!! I had the Steak Tostada salad and my husband had the shrimp burrito. Top notch!! We will be back and recommend this to all that are craving delicious Mexican food. Thank you Serranos! And thank you to the chef :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great salsa bar, and a cool little place. We had the enchiladas suizas and taco salad & both were great. I highly recommend this fast casual gem!"}
{"text":"Best tortilla soup I've ever had! Came here because I had a groupon and good thing I did. Easily my new favorite restaurant. Nice and attentive staff. Very clean and all our food was great!"}
{"text":"Although it looks like a fast food spot, the food is restaurant quality. The shrimp enchiladas were full of flavor and delicious. All the fresh sauces were a nice authentic touch. The decor is great too. I'll definitely be back. Great food and value."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. They seem to have this small town big city feel. Love the Mexican modern music. They smile, but hardly speak with us, other than take our order. It's alright, but it makes it hard to to judge, for tips. Hey, would that be considered a tip?"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican joint near Vegas. I had the Enchilada suizas with chicken. The chicken was perfectly grilled, with excellent flavor and super moist. The salsa bar has at least 15 options so regardless of your tolerance of spicy foods you will find something you like. My favorite sauce was the green Serrano salsa. I wish I had taken some home! I also split a side of fries. The fries are salty and crispy topped with cilantro. I dipped those in my green salsa, but they come with ketchup. For dessert we enjoyed the cheesecake chimichanga (Not positive about the name, chimi-something). It had a fried, empanada-type shell and was filled with a very sweet cheesecake icing. The presentation was beautiful. 

The service was incredible. The workers greeted us warmly, provided our silverware (even though the set up is fast food style), checked on us to ask how we enjoyed the meal, removed plates when we finished eating, and thanked us as we left. I can't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Serrano's is a great little gem I found passing by and boy have I been happy with them! I love the salsa selection, the refill on chips and the agua frescas they have are great. I have been back 3x now and will be back many more."}
{"text":"Great little spot. The Enchiladas Suizas & Tortilla Soup are a favorite, and the salsa bar never disappoints. Service is always exceptional and you're never waiting long for your food. Definitely a hidden gem I wish more folks would check out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I personally love this place! It is so good. The salsa bar has about 15 salsas to choose from. Including free sour cream which is a plus. I first tried it when my wife and I purchased a Groupon. I love the chicken burrito! It is full of flavor. This place is so good that i exhausted the amount of Groupons one person can buy on their account and also had my wife sign up for groupon so that we can buy the maximum amount of groupons on that account as well. haha
I mean come on... who doesnt like great food for a great price. 

The staff here is amazing as well. The two ladies that work the register and the floor are very friendly and deliver the food to your table and clean up after you. The food is restaurant quality at a Chipolte price. An amazing combination! Not to mention the beans are out of this world and I believe they are going to have a drive through in the near future! What more can you ask for?!?

I have and will continue to recommend this place to anybody looking for a meal where good quality and great price meet!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada burrito was good! I love the variety of different hot and mild salsas. The Molcajete salsa was amazing!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and we're trying to find good Mexican food. Just ran across this lave and decided to try it. Very fresh food-guacamole and chips super fresh and large salsa bar was great. Cheese enchiladas w/rice & beans fresh and hot-good except sauce was a little  spicy for me. Husband had chicken tortilla soup--said it was fresh and hot. Only reason not a five star because it is a nicely converted fast food restaurant--you order at counter and they bring you your food. Dinner was $25 for us . We will try this lace again! 
me"}
{"text":"First time here and we where not disappointed. I had the steak enchiladas with red sauce  which were finger licking good. My  husband had the Torta with fries and we shared some yummy Pozle. The lady taking our order was very pleasant and greeted us with a smile. We will be back to try some more of the delicious things on the menu."}
{"text":"went in for a late snack and the food was delicious- the young man who took our order was super nice and helpful! 

I got the chipotle shrimp burrito and it was incredible- very flavorful and filling. I love that they have a salsa bar so you can try all the different kinds they offer- and the fact that sour cream is on it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Three weeks after their opening we arrived for lunch. When the rancid smell of oil trap issues greeted us in the parking lot I was concerned! This issue is a problem at two other Henderson establishments! I'm tempted to not even go in. Once it was explained to me that the problem is grease container and not sewer issues I felt better however it does assault the senses regardless of the source! 

The menu is unique, and as other diners have mentioned ingredients fresh. Rice is very good, beans... Not so much , i like more pork flavor in my pintos. Next time I will pass on the sides! 

Carnitas Tacos and Were delicious! The heated plate tends to cause the corn tortillas to sweat and stick making holding a ripped tortilla a bit of a challenge! 

The Mexican egg rolls were the only items my partner and I shared.  We credit these for the case of urgent discomfort we each had shortly after leaving. 

To find a Cuban sandwich on the menu delighted my partner. Fries were a treat with extra effort to set them a cut above average lunch side dish. 

Loved the interior.  Obviously there are issues to address. But in time I hope to return.... Great heads up from other diners that burritos have beans in them."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, and Maria was very professional!! Also a very clean restaurant!! Thank you Maria!!"}
{"text":"Excellent for a low keyed great tasting Mexican meal that's fresh and well prepared The salsas are Outstanding! Mild to hot...the best flavors"}
{"text":"Don't be thrown by the fast food building (used to be a Taco Bell) the service was great and the carne asada tacos were delicious! Authentic Mexican food - delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch as this location seems like a fast food place, but the food was much better than we expected. Portions were generous and the food was quite good. Prices are surprisingly modest. They have several types of condiments including three kinds of salsa ranging from mild to hot (they aren't kidding about the hot). We had the signature burritos, one with beef and one with carnita meat. Tortilla soup was very tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting my parents and found this place on yelp so decided to give it a try.  I had carnitas torta, dad had enchiladas and mom had wet asada burrito.  We each really enjoyed our meals.  Flavor, freshness, portion size, price - very good.  Yum salsa bar as well.  I would like it better if they sold beer!  Would have given 5 stars, but I thought it was strange my torta came with stinky Parmesan fries... if I'd paid more attention when I ordered I would have substituted.  Will definitely be back, use the drive thru and/or uber eats."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve the 1 star. I have been going since they open, and most of the time enjoyed my meal, and service. But not anymore.  I called in a order and asked for a dry burrito , and when I went in I repeated the the dry burrito order. She didn't seem to show must interested.  I leave to find I got a wet burrito.  I went back and told the lady who was very rude to me. The restaurant didn't have any air conditioning and was hot as heck. She remade the order and told me to order it correctly the next time. This is how  burritos come. I looked at the menu and it didn't say anything about coming wet.... so you don't get want you want and treated bad . The cashier was so rude.  She doesn't like her job. Go somewhere else to work..... but I won't return. They don't need my money...."}
{"text":"Moved here from so cal and had been looking for a good Mexican food joint that was not fancy and had high tourist prices. This place has some really good food and a cool atmosphere. The service was great. I think that this is a hidden unknown gem of a restaurant. I highly recommend this as a place to try."}
{"text":"We found this little gem on YELP. Staff was welcoming and very friendly. We ordered the carne asada nachos and it was as good as the great Mexican restaurants in San Diego where we are from. No extra charge for the sour cream. It is included in the salsa bar which has quite a choice of delicious salsas. The Jamaica drink we ordered comes with a free refill. So drink up! The place is clean and orders come out fast. I have to say even the bathrooms are super clean. We will visit this place again in the future! This place will not disappoint! 
Thank you Serrano's"}
{"text":"Their food is always flavorful and staff is always friendly. Drive thru does take a bit of time to have someone answer but it's not an issue for me.  You definitely have to try the quesadilla. It's delicious with the rice and beans."}
{"text":"So this location used to be a taco bell, and I have watched them transform it into a serrano's. I came in on a Thursday evening at 8 p.m. and the place was empty. Just two employees working, both very polite and looking busy. Me and my baby mama ordered nachos and tacos with refried beans and rice. It was very very good. Lots of different sauces from mild to extra hot. A must try for any locals looking for a simple quiet place."}
{"text":"Serrano's was a diamond in the rough. Ceviche was better than expected especially for a land locked area. Serrano's salsa is a fiery surprise, tread lightly. My GF usually orders the spiciest thai dishes establishments have to offer. After slurping down a sample of serrano's, she was sucking on ice cubes for comfort. We'll be back when she acts up. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Solid quick Mexican food.  I didn't notice anything too special, but good food at a good price."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide whether this place should be a 3 or a 4 so I rounded up based on the salsa bar.  I bookmarked it prior to our most recent Vegas trip and we made it here for a late lunch on Saturday.  It was pretty empty when we arrived but busy when we left.  I had a few special requests for my total order and when I double checked with the cashier, he seemed a bit put out that I had to make sure he got my order right.  I ordered a chicken taco, a carnitas taco, and rice and beans.  Both tacos were good, but the carnitas was superior in my book.  Except for one thing.  One piece of carnitas had a big globby piece of fat on it.  I'm so glad I saw it before eating it - gross.  However, the carnitas without globby fat was excellent.  I'm not sure we would return - certainly not before trying other places, but the salsa bar and good carnitas made it worthwhile."}
{"text":"If you want it spicy here's your spot.  Even though they just opened the food was great.  Still getting everything together but I was impressed.  

Salsa bar was on point.  Lot's of flavor, even more spice.  They offer some sour cream if you want to cook it down a little.  I liked the chipotle and the Serrano the best. 

I had the steak.  Tons of flavor, fresh ingredients. 

The queso fundido was okay.  A little too think for my taste. 

I will return, no question."}
{"text":"I don't  even know  why I gave  this place a one star.The  food is over priced. I ordered  3 tacos  with rice and beans.The beans tasted burnt and the tacos weren't good  tasting  at all. Now I will  say the restaurant  was clean but the food sucked."}
{"text":"Place is very cozy and clean. Horchata is the best i had yet. Crew is friendly and the food is good and delicious. Will surely keep coming back here for our mex appetite."}
{"text":"We live in Henderson and my daughter wanted authentic Mexican food. This place is really good. Everything tastes amazing and the prices are great. The staff is friendly and they even have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Amazing food and had a wonderful expirence here on Sunday with my family.Staff was helpful with helping me place my order.highly recommend"}
{"text":"I really don't think anyone who has written a review for this place has had real good Mexican food, this place was not the spot, hopefully something good pops up here"}
{"text":"I had the fish burrito and my man had the carne asada burrito. Both items were DELICIOUS! Each burrito came with rice and beans on the side.  I normally add salt to the beans and rice but these both had excellent flavor. The salsa's were amazing. I tried all of the 3 chili pepper hottt salsas and each one was very good. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"yeah, no more business.  They had good food, guess they weren't doing enough business or their rent went up.  Highly recommend El Torito on Boulder Hwy as an alternative..."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't more famous than Don Tor Taco or Roberto's. This place has the best enchiladas I've ever had. I like this place. I recommend to go here with friends and family.

And the cashier is very pretty and very helpful to me and my friend. Very good service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super unassuming, usually pretty empty, which makes me hope they are doing well enough to stick around a while because it's DANG GOOD! Salsa/pepper bar, simple but delicious menu. Fast and ready for pick up, good portions, cheap prices, we are happy, regular customers! Chipotle shrimp burrito is our go-to, hands down. But you can't really go wrong with anything here! We are happy to support this local place."}
{"text":"Great steak meat, the street tacos were great. The retried beans have a hint of chorizo in them which I love because that the way my dad makes them.  They give plenty of guacamole but if you like it spicy ask for extra jalapeños on the side then the pick is very flavorful and fresh. 

Fresh that's a great way to describe the food.  

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the traditional rice while the favors are 100% on point it's not the regular rice like you make at home. Wish I could give 4.5 stars. 

Also, great decor inside. Very clean and on point. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Affordable, fast, and nice decor for such a small space. Food was good, full of flavor, and a decent size portion.  My only wish was that they put on the half wall or plants so you cannot see the register from the dining area."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend to try out the Pozole. So far it was good but the next day got really bad food poisoning from the pork, today I still feel sick from the uncooked meat."}
{"text":"Great tacos and deals. Churros were great 
! Will come again! Great ace for a quiet date@"}
{"text":"Went here after driving by and then seeing a groupon. We ordered the enchiladas and the southwest egg rolls. While everything was fine, it was mediocre and unmemorable.   Not sure what kind of Mexican it was supposed to be. It had an odd flavoring that I didn't like or dislike. I did like the salsa bar, but not enough to go back. Plus chips were not included with your meal."}
{"text":"So I've been to this location twice the first time was amazing I had them make me a custom order because I'm so picky and it came out amazing ....this time however was horrible I'll probably never return because of the quality of food this time I ordered a Carne Asada Serrano burrito what I got was grocery store bought Guerra tortilla filled with un seasoned carnita meat that was mostly fat parts ...I seriously could not believe how bland the food was that it was the same establishment I had tried before very sad I had high hopes for them. And if I did have to drive through traffic to get back to them I would have returned it for a refund ...."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon deal and we got SO much food. They had a traditional Mexican menu, including ceviche, which can be hard to find. The salsa bar had a lot of choices. The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The ceviche was very good. I had the fajita bowl which was also great. Deleting is nice and clean which calm music. Guest service is also very good and friendly. Good selection of hot sauce and drinks. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect. You pull in and immediately think it's fast food. I almost didn't go in because if it. I did go in and was very pleased. The food was EXCELLENT. The chipotle shrimp burrito and steak taco were so good. Better than anything I've had on the strip. This place is a hidden Gem."}
{"text":"Was driving by this place around dinner time and decided to give them a shot. Not overly impressed. Great salsa bar and friendly workers. Tacos weren't bad. Super nachos pretty mediocre. Main problem is they are overpriced for the portion sizes they serve. There's a lot of competition in the area so they really need to step it up if they're going to survive."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about the delicious dinner we had at Serrano's Mexican Grill nearly a week ago! We'd been wanting to give the restaurant a try, especially because friends we trust said it wouldn't disappoint. We were still holding our breath a bit until we took our first bites...then, oh my! Delicious! The food was even better than our friends said! Between our family of four, we shared steak nachos, a cheese quesadilla, a creamy shrimp chipotle burrito and a chicken Caesar-chipotle burrito. Every item was so, so good. We loved that house-made guacamole came with each entree and that sour cream was included on the awesome salsa bar. I rarely eat the rice and beans that Mexican restaurants pad their entrees with, but we ate every morsel served--the rice was fluffy, not dry and not greasy and the beans were flavorful and a pleasant texture. The restaurant was clean, the seating comfortable and the decor was clever and spirited. We were stuffed and happy when the meal was done and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The food is flavorful and you get decent portions for the price!! Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Finally checked out Serrano's. What an awesome alternative to the chains, and even a nice change of pace from Rio. The chicken enchiladas (with red sauce) are better than most restaurants I've been to. And the guacamole appetizer with homemade chips was a great way to start (not cheap, but worth it for the freshness). Go here, and support small business."}
{"text":"Love this type of food. Employees were nice. Interesting use of buckets and baskets....as lamps. Used a groupon so got a great deal,  and will definitely be back. Sad they add bacon fat to the refried beans. We had the fajita burrito,  real good minus the rice and beans, and burrito bowl. The bowl comes with brown rice. Its nice to eat on real plates with real forks. 
Salsa bar is always nice, but was low on salsa.   Floor was dirty."}
{"text":"We went on opening night, they had been open maybe 2 hours. 

They were working on the heating issue, as there was no heat and we were freezing! I was, unfortunately, uncomfortably cold. 

I ordered the chipotle chicken burrito. It was huge! The flavor was good and it also came with a side of rice and beans. Had I known that, though, I would have asked them to keep the beans out of the burrito. Now I know for next time. 

The boy ordered the chicken and cheese enchilada plate. He reports the flavor was good, but there was a disappointing amount of cheese (more cheese, please!) and they were really small (especially compared to my gigantic burrito!). 

I finished half my burrito and just couldn't do any more. He finished his plate and was still hungry. 

For the both of us, plus one fountain drink, the total was around $20. Not horrible for the quality (and my quantity). 

The staff was very friendly and came to check on us a couple times. We didn't expect that. The building used to be a Taco Bell, this is a definite and welcome improvement!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, delicious, and fast! The salsa bar was great as well! Very clean inside."}
{"text":"What a great fast Mexican place! I'm spoiled living in Southern California when it comes to Mexican food but I suppose Vegas is So Cal North when it comes to Mexican food because this place another example of the great Mexican places we've visited out here. The pozole is fresh and generously sized, the flavors of the salsa from the generous salsa bar are authentic. You order up at the counter but food is brought out and plates are bussed. I'd definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this spot based on the reviews, and asked my guy to meet me for dinner. When I pulled up and saw the exterior, I thought I had accidentally picked a glorified Taco Bell for date night! But no, other than the outer shell, this spot is a huge upgrade.

Interior has a clean and modern red and white color scheme with rustic touches, like woven basket lighting fixtures and a framed shelf for hot sauces. The have a salsa bar and house-picked peppers, and service was attentive and friendly. There are two TVs in the dining room, and they had no problem putting on the Warriors game for us! 

We started with the chips and guac ($7), fresh and tasty, then shared the bowl of tortilla soup ($6) mentioned in many reviews- light with a flavorful broth and plenty of chicken and avocado. The shrimp tacos were better than the mahi-mahi ($2.50/ea) but the star was definitely the Enchiladas Suizas! Packed with grilled chicken and topped with a wonderfully tart and slightly spicy tomatillo sauce, these were incredible! Lastly, we shared the flan ($4)- even though the server warned us it had been slightly overcooked, it was creamy and had a light touch of cinnamon!  

Don't let the outside fool you- they took a former TB location, kept the Mexican theme and upgraded it to make this spot a real treasure. I'm hoping to find myself on this side of town more often!"}
{"text":"Foods aiight.  Id classify it ad healthyishkinda?

I stopped going here because....

#1 'our water is broken.'  How is your water broken?

#2 when i went when they opened and you asked for water they gave you a big glass.  Now its some small cup bs.

Food aiiight, salsa bar good, but dont mess with my free agua.  This is a desert and daddy is thirsty.

Horchata gives me violent doodoos.  Need free water."}
{"text":"Great food friendly service the salsa was wonderful. I'm sure to come back here again as this is the best mexican food I've had since coming to Nevada.We Had The Fries with Carne and A Burrito bowl with carnitas.  The Carnitas was tender and flavorful & the beans were fresh.  The Carne was also tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is Mexican food, it didn't taste like it.   The beans had no flavor and the rice, I don't even know how to describe it, white rice, wet and it almost tasted like a spoiled rice it was definitely not your typical Mexican rice. The food didn't taste fresh, it tasted out of a microwaved. I have to be honest but this is the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! I recommend this to anyone who wants amaizng Mexican food. The fajitas are to the spot and customer service is great!! Definitely loving this place."}
{"text":"Out of towners looking for good Mexican food..FOUND IT! Great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Been going to try the place for awhile went today for a late lunch hit the drive thru. 
No taquitos only flautas. Boo. So I settled for tacos- Lady couldn't seem to take the order too well 3 street tacos and a diet coke pretty tough I know... 
Seemed overpriced $10 and change for 3 street tacos and a drink..? 
Got a Regular Coke instead of Diet-- And small when I ordered Large .. Yay way to win me over.
Had to ask for my drink and then very nicely to get some Hot Sauce or Salsa before she was trying to slam the window closed on me again. Nobody behind me mind you.
I'll hit Del Taco next time it's a stones throw away and at least you know what you get there and it's not overpriced. I'd wager they'll be gone within 6 months or so.
BTW - Food I did get was ok nothing special and there was only 1 car in front of me in the Drive Thru and nobody inside eating, should have been my 1st clue. Good Luck to them they better at least offer some good service to go with the mediocre food. p"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch.  Good food and amazing service. Try the tortilla soup, it's delicious."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Serrano's. The woman who took my order was very friendly and helpful and was happy to accept the Groupon and tell me about the restaurant. I ordered a chicken and steak enchilada and my wife ordered the fajita burrito. The meat was exceptionally tender and perfectly seasoned. They were very generous in the meat portion in the fajita burrito with large juicy chunks of steak. I plan on going back without a groupon because the prices were great for the quantity and quality of food (7.49 for a large burrito with a side of rice and beans with chips and a salsa bar with tons of salsa options)."}
{"text":"Someone please point me in the direction of carne Asada fries!!!! This place doesn't have what I'm looking for. Their Carne Asada fries are basically steak meat, not Carne Asada, fries and cheese with a dash of cilantro and garlic. I recently moved here from San Diego where I lived for over 30 years. The Mexican food in San Diego is legit. Carne Asada fries are a really popular dish there so I thought I would give this place a shot. Typically it comes with fries, meat, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and depending on where you go beans. I was so disappointed with what I got from here. The fries were half over cooked and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp, the meat was dry and tasted like steak meat not carne Asada, and the cheese tasted like it had been melted in the microwave. We ordered our meal to go and what really disappointed me was when we got home we ordered three meals and only got one tablespoon of guacamole. Seriously? They really skimp on all the \"extra\" stuff. Which for me being from San Diego isn't considered extra. The one thing that I will give them is for a portion size it was decent but the ratio of fries to meat was totally off. The whole household was unanimous in not returning. The hunt for Carne Asada fries continues!"}
{"text":"Must go place in Las Vegas. The enchiladas are exceptional and the salsas are very tasty. The ambiance is very nice and it is very clean. Over all it's the best Mexican food I have ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered food Togo and it was bomb. Their beef hard shell tacos and street tacos were delicious and their salsa bar is amazing. They have a whole variety and the staff was friendly. And the tortillas chips they gave me were fresh! I will be coming back for sure. A bonus is the decorations inside. Makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"They really need to pick a side. Are you fast food or not?  You order from the counter like fast food, and the service quality is definitely fast food, (would it kill you to smile?), but the prices are restaurant prices and the time it takes to get your food is more reminiscent of a sit down restaurant. They do bring the food to you on regular plates but the food isn't anything that wowed me.  I definitely wouldn't  say you shouldn't try it but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat Real Mexican Food, salsas are amazing , I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"A little pricey but cute little mexican restaurant , and good food! Much better than any other mexican place in this area!"}
{"text":"This was a tasty, little place!!  Everything was nice and clean and the service was great!  I had the nachos; best I've had in a long time!!  My boyfriend had the carne asada street tacos.  He said they weren't the best he's had, but they were good.  We would DEFINITELY go back."}
{"text":"Quaint little Mexican joint. Excellent food made from fresh ingredients. The guacamole is second to none! Wow! Prices are great for the quality you receive. The decor is great as well. Love it and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and with all the good reviews I knew it would be good. I was wrong.
I do have to say that the beans and the salsa bar were amazing, the rest of it not so much. I had 2 tacos, one grilled chicken and the other one steak. The chicken had no flavor at all, there might as well been no meat on it for what it tasted like. The steak was slightly better but the texture of the beef was more like pot roast than steak.
The service could of been better. I felt like I was a bother to the cashier and when I was giving my order I was interrupted by them asking me if my order was for here or to go. Also the price is kind of high for the quality of the food. I really wanted to like this place but I doubt that I will ever go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place our first time here food is great and the salsa is great well we will definitely be back customer service was outstanding"}
{"text":"Their sign says open, their Yelp says closes at 10 pm, and their door was open, yet when we walked in they told us that they were closed at 9 pm. Also, online it says that they close at 10 pm. One employee didn't even tell us that they were closed when we walked to the register. She walked away and had someone else tell us."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a reasonable price. My wife and I are in love with their chicken tortilla soup! It is always made fresh with fresh avocados cut on top.  The small tacos are also very fresh and non greasy.  They are trying to get a license to have margaritas and beer but they are still waiting for that.  Overall a must check out yourself restaurant!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Serrano's about 2 weeks ago, on our way home from work. We had heard good things and couldn't wait to try it. I had a chorizo taco and my hubby had a burrito. I was excited about the cinnamon cheesecake chimichanga, so I only ordered one taco. The meal was excellent! Hot, prepared fresh for our order and served up quickly to go. We loved the sauce and salsa bar and took little samples of about 6 different types home. All were delicious and we agreed with an Hispanic friend that the refried beans and Mexican rice are excellent. We found the price to be no more than any other place in the area (even on a budget), and it definitely was fresher tasting than a traditional 'fast food' joint. We can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"I had a fajita burrito. It was okay. My wife had a burrito cup with grilled shrimp.  First, they left the shrimp off.   Then they brought it back out with gray,  uncooked shrimp scooped on top. 

Service was horrible.  Even though my food was cooked correctly, you can get as good or better anywhere in town. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is so easy to overlook on Sunset that I have driven by it probably 100 times before I realized what it was. I am now sad after having tried it that I didn't go in sooner. The food here is spectacular! My only complaint with the entire place was that the salsa bar was kind of lacking. I was excited to see that they did have a salsa bar to begin with, but after trying several of them with a variety of spices, I was disappointed...they all seemed to have the same basic taste...of canned tomato sauce...very odd and very disappointing. The food I ordered however was delicious. I ordered a torta and the meat was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The price overall wasn't bad either. I will be back soon to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Just ate with the family here for the 1st time. Fantastic flavor to the food. Great ambience. Neat salsa bar with lots to choose from and lots of juicy limes which I use a ton of on my street tacos. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good salsa selection. Great service. I'd recommend if you're in the area! Food and everything tastes very fresh"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this and here's my opinion. When you first walk in hold your nose. Seems they have been having issues with the women's restroom. It smells awful and hope they fix it soon.
This used to be a fast food restaurant and it still has that feel. The decor could of had a little more imagination.
The food. I ordered enchiladas and it was supposed to be different from the traditional. It wasnt chicken suiza. It looked and tasted like the traditional which was made with tomatillo sauce.
The up however, their salsa bar kicked some booty! I'd just go back for that. Maybe they had a bad day but I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here. It would not be my first choice. Food was so-so, service was good but they have some room for improvement."}
{"text":"Slow, pricey for fast food restaurant, and salsa bar containers are less than an ounce in size."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the Mucho Macho steak dinner and a fountain drink.  The food came out quickly and was very tasty!  It's not \"fast food\" but it was quick.  They have real silverware and not plastic utensils, which is a nice touch.  Based on this first trip, I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for quite a while now for lunch. I find the food to be very tasty and I really like the salsa bar. I usually get the two tacos combo for lunch with Carnitas, which is really good. The people who work here are really nice and are very interested in me having a enjoyable time while I'm here. I highly recommend this business."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going here. I ordered the Carne Asada fries. They were horrible. Just meat, cheese, and fries. I wouldn't recommend ordering them. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING, the salsa was off the chain & the food was very fresh. The employees were fast, attentive, and nice. Very good experience, we will be revisiting very soon. Last note, the cheesecake chimichangas are not to be missed !!"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly authentic and delicious! It does not disappoint with taste or portions!"}
{"text":"Pretty good grub.  I had the tortilla soup.  They didn't include avocado (shortage perhaps?) and the tortilla strips weren't crunchy, but the flavor of the soup was good and the meat was delicious.  My dad had two ground beef hard tacos and rice and beans.  The tacos looked good and my dad killed em both.  Beans and rice were fine.  Tasty salsas at the salsa bar.  Interesting menu and friendly staff.  I'd go again.  Not a lot of people there but hopefully they make it."}
{"text":"Great Salsa bar and food. So glad we decided to go to this place instead of Del Taco next door!"}
{"text":"Eveything I have had is amazing
Enchiladas 
Fajitas
Street Tacos 
Friendly staff and very clean."}
{"text":"Nice people work here.  Got the enchiladas. Excellent.  Chips n guacamole. Yummy.  Good prices can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"All great mexican foos you need to eat is at Serrano's mexican grill. We had enchiladas, burrito cup, and tongue tacos. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Wasn't all that impressed service was slow salsa bar was dirty food was OK not horrible not great with only two people working on Saturday it slows things down and for the prices that they're charging I'll go back to Faustos. Nothing was really bad about the visit other than tables were wiped down salsa bar seemed a little bit dirty and just very very slow service not impressed."}
{"text":"So far I've yet to be disappointed with this place. Provides a small menu but a good selection of food.
The quality is very good an extremely tasteful.  They have a very good selection of hot sauces go with your  entrees and homemade chips.  
Everything here is made fresh. So you get that fresh taste of the food they do tell that it will take up to 15 minutes to cook and prepare your food so be prepared but being fresh it is well worth it.
  As long as place keeps up its quality and its freshness of the food and  the place will become very popular it's very hard to find a place you can make good food such as here that is good feeling and you walk away full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. You get a lot of bang for your buck here, most items are under $10 and are generously portioned.

The food is not excessively greasy or used with a lot of lard like most fast-food style Mexican tends to be. The meat is also very flavorful. 

The salsa bar is amazing. I am particularly picky about salsa and am typically disappointed by the salsa most joints offer, but Serrano's has such a wide variety of flavorful and spicy salsa that it has become half the reason I go there! 

I definitely recommend this place over any Roberto's or the like- the food quality here is much better and it has a better variety of menu options and flavors.

I highly recommend trying their tortas!"}
{"text":"I had the burrito cup for my first time there last night with Carnitas as my choice of meat. It was a great choice and very delicious. Their salsa bar is by far the best salsa bar I've been too. I recommend the Salsa Serrano! :) it's safe to say I'll be back, again and again!"}
{"text":"Quick service and authentic menu! The pricing is fair. Well definitely be back! We ordered two California burritos. They were loaded with flavor and under $20 bucks."}
{"text":"The service here was exceptional and everyone was very friendly. The cook came around and asked how everyone liked their meal. They also pride themselves in cooking your meal. This is one of the better Mexican places to eat at. Finally. I got the enchiladas and fries. My husband got a burrito and my daughter shared with us. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Serrano's Mexican Restaurant is the classic example of not judging a book by it's cover. I know I've driven by this place multiple times before, but simply never noticed it. Oddly enough, it's taken the place of an old Taco Bell on Sunset, right in between Green Valley and Mountain Vista. Inside is nothing like a Taco Bell though, or any other fast food place for that matter. It's bright, clean and nicely decorated. It is a full fledged fast casual restaurant with booth and table seating, a sauce bar, drink fountain, etc.

Because it is more fast casual, there isn't much in the way of service, but the guy we placed our order with was nice and informative. I had some questions about a few things on the menu, as well as if they made some of the sauces and pepper mixes in house (which they do), and he answered them all without hesitation. It's also a nice touch that they bring the food out to you when ready, and will ask if you need anything from there.

When it comes to the food, there's plenty of options. I like that everything on the menu is actual Mexican food, and they have stuff you don't normally see, like ceviche. Everything is reasonably priced and we decided to share quite a few things that came out to only about $50. 

From the appetizers, we started with the Ceviche and Queso Fundido. The fundido is a blend of cheeses that comes out ooey and gooey but nice and thick at the same time. It's got great flavor that goes well with the warm corn tortillas served alongside it, or their fresh chips, which are served with the ceviche. And the ceviche is pretty dang good too. They are a little heavy on the tomato, but the amount of citrus is spot on. I really like that they use Mahi-mahi in it, and serve it with what looks like almost an entire half of fresh avocado. This is one of the best ceviches I've had in town, and the portion size is huge for only $8.99.

On the main dish side, we also shared a couple Pastor Street Tacos and a Chipotle Shrimp Burrito. While the pastor was a tad on the dry side, it still had great flavor. I did have to add some sauce to it, but they have a great variety of sauces, and the tacos were decent with a number of them. The shrimp burrito on the other hand was a huge surprise. It was packed full of plump, juicy shrimp, rice and a delicious chipotle sauce. It didn't taste like a plain jane jarred sauce, and the shrimp was cooked well. It was also only $8.99 and served with both rice and beans on the side. Other reviews mention how great their shrimp tacos are, and if the burrito is anything to off of, I can't wait to try those.

Aside from having great food, I think Serrano's fresh sauce and in-housed pickled peppers really make them stand out from other fast casual Mexican restaurants. They have a good variety of house made sauces ranging from mild, to hot sauces that use serranos and habaneros. Their pickled peppers are unbelievable, and good enough to be eaten either on their own, or on top of other food. They even have a whole wall display with popular bottled sauces if that's your thing.

Overall, Serrano's is definitely a place that has a lot more to offer than what you'd think from looking at the outside. Don't just drive by or you'll be missing a very worthy stop. It's a bit far from me, but I'd definitely come back without thinking twice."}
{"text":"We found this place on the yelp. They have very delicious foods and fast service. We had fright burrito with onion wich was amazing. 
I would recommend this Mexican Grill to anyone. Have to try this:)!"}
{"text":"Place is very good, great salsa bar. I like fast food Mexican places, better quality than a robertos or Faustos for sure. Try the enchiladas very good , interesting choice for tortilla soup but still good. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and wing fast food."}
{"text":"our Meetup visited this restaurant last week. It's okay for a Mexican restaurant. They don't serve alcohol or beer so if you're looking for that this may not be the place to go to. But if you just want simple Mexican food to sit down eat and maybe enjoy but your family in a family atmosphere this is good. I would just say that their food is okay it's not the best in town."}
{"text":"Meh. 

My wife and I were looking for some quick authentic Mexican food, and we stumbled across this place on yelp and decided to check it out. 

We were not impressed. The chicken and carne asada tacos were bland and dry. The rice was too wet and mushy, and the chicken enchilada was no bueno. The guac was good; it was spicy due to the jalapeno peppers, but $6.99 for chips and guac is a bit pricey IMO. 

The cashier was friendly, and they have a salsa bar with good variety.

Not sure if I'll come back though unless someone I know would want to try this place really badly."}
{"text":"I went there with a few times with friends for lunch and dinner since we heard good things about  this location and wanted to give it a try. I have to say that this is a pretty good place.

This place is located on Sunset Road not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself has a typical fast food layout, and can get a little crowded at times so you should maybe avoid the lunch and dinner rush hour.

We tried several things from nachos to burritos and tacos and they all tasted good. The price is also reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for a burrito which will be pretty big and will definitely fill you. Last but not least, this place offers a lot of different salsas for free that you should take advantage of!

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this place with my dad and I really really loved there tacos of steak they were super good My dad almost enjoyed his fajita burrito of steak. I wasn't a fan of the rice in pretty sure for other people it's good but it wasn't my favorite.this might not matter but they played all my favorite Spanish songs here. The tables are nice and clean all the time and the lady who works there is so kind and nice. I totally recommend this place a lot."}
{"text":"They are out of business. Drove by today sign on door will open shortly. No construction or remodeling going on. They are done!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday very disappointed in the crisp meat taco 1st off  the shell was ice cold  meat inside was just luke warm .Has a few shredded pieces of cheese and I mean a few  and there was just a little lettuce .Not  very appetizering  .I like my tacos filled lot of cheese and lettuce plus the tortillas shell at least warm .
On the positive side they have a nice selection of salsa,s  all kind plus sour cream.My  husband had the tongue  was very soft and easy to eat he enjoyed that ."}
{"text":"It's ok. A little pricey for what you get. They do have a good salsa bar. But, the rest of menu was a bit lackluster. It was a little too \"Americanized\" for me. I doubt I will go back, I prefer Fausto's or Roberto's."}
{"text":"I typically don't go to Mexican restaurants, we can cook what they make at home. (Not as tasty I'm sure) But, my boyfriend and I go to the Galaxy theater all the time and kept saying need to try that place out. Finally we went!! I was starving! We walk in, cashier greeted us immediately and allowed us to look over the menu. The lady at the counter had the most phenomenal customer service I've seen at a restaurant. She was attentive, quick and suggestive. I don't think I've ever received that anywhere. 

Moving along.. We ordered so many options of tacos, enough to take home. 4 different kinds of tacos- grilled chicken, mahi mahi, and shrimp oh and steak! DELISH!! Their salsa... I loved! They were fire! The flautas were good too, but we were so full we took them for lunch the next day. The chef came over to our table almost towards the end, introduced himself, asked if everything was great and we said yes of course and invited us to go back. He explained a little about their food and their goal as a restaurant. We will definitely see you guys a lot more!!! I really can't stand for Lindo Michoacan, they serve so much rice and beans there's no room for the actual meal from chicken, fish or shrimp. These we're great portioned tacos and flautas. We went Thursday around 9pm by the way and the service was still a 10!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food at a fair price. I had the fish burrito and it was tasty. My wife ordered the chicken torta combo, my daughter had the Cuban sandwich and my son had the chicken enchiladas. Everyone really enjoyed their food and service was excellent. Features a salsa bar"}
{"text":"The food was great. The menu isn't huge but what they offer is all done very well. Service was fast and the salsa bar was a nice touch as well. Had the chicken Cesar burrito and a plate of French fries (and they were great!) Portions were outstanding for the price."}
{"text":"Upscale fast food with glass plates and no plastic silverware here. Excellent food. Great find."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I even had them cater my husbands birthday party. The variety of salsas is one of our favorite things coming here. The meat is never over cooked and they have so many options to choose from. We wish there was one closer to us but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Do yourself a favor and quit passing it up. Friendly people, good service and bomb food. Seek this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was here last week just as they were about to close...really felt bad about that.  However one of the workers waved us on in from the inside so my friend and I got out and ventured in.  We decided not to eat inside since they were already cleaning the dining room, but that's no problem.  The lady helping us order was super helpful, offering samples of the horchata and explaining the menu to us.  

I went with the Fajita Burrito with Carnitas.  I have to say it was probably one of the best burritos I've ever had.  And the beans that come with it...absolutely delicious!  

My friend ordered the Enchiladas Suizas with Chicken - I just had one bite but it was very tasty...he enjoyed them as well.  

The chips and guacamole were great as well.  The guac looked a little bland when I opened up the container (which was huge!) but it wasn't bland at all - definitely had a kick to it!

The salsa bar was also a nice addition.  We loaded up on every type of salsa they had just to try it out.  There's also sour cream and pickled jalapenos/carrots.  

I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Oh, beans. So little and docile, yet notoriously unloved with their perpetually bad rap for people's intestinal inner-workings. (Yes, we're talking about farts right now.) So classy I know, but well-intended -- throw your windy worries to the wayside because Serrano's has got some of the best beans on the block... seriously.

First off, no it's not fast food, but it's not a restaurant either. It's similar to Baja Fresh/Rubio's fast-casual approach, but delivering higher quality food and silverware to boot. Occupying the space of a previous Taco Bell, I admit that I've driven by this place countless times and never once gave it the time of the day. That is, until Groupon. Then like a viral meme, it instantly became mine and my boyfriend's new favorite hit for Mexican food. So good! Restaurant quality eats without the restaurant price tags. 

Their salsa bar is extensive and unrivaled. Hands down, they have the best selection of salsas to accompany and adorn your meal. (The creamy green sauce is a must!) If that wasn't enough, they even have a shelf full of hot sauces at your leisure. Their fresh drink station includes tamarind, horchata, and southwestern lemonade, which is a light hibiscus drink. I've tried all of them, but the sweet horchata's a great way to finish a meal. 

Our first visit, we both got the classic burrito which comes with a side of rice and beans. Rice is okay, but beans is where it's at! The cashier wiped down our table before serving us our piping hot plates. The dining area's clean, plenty of booth seating, with cute beer bottle salt-and-pepper shakers. Highly recommend! Plus the next day, the beans will have worked their magic and you'll feel five pounds lighter."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!

When I came in, there was only one other customer inside, so I was skeptical that the food wasn't going to be as great since I assumed it might of been sitting out all day. But right after I ordered, my food was made FRESH!! It tasted so good. I got carne asada tacos, rice, and ceviche. All of which were really flavorful.

Definitely don't judge a book by its cover with this place. It will surprise you! Also, when I arrived, it appealed to be a very clean environment and the place looked nice.

I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A great little Mexican food place. The store appears to be a remodeled Taco Bell or something. You order at the counter and have a seat. This is about as close to fast food as you will get.
The menu was a little difficult to read as it was written is chalk on the menu board. 
I had a steak burrito and my wife has the chicken burrito. Both came with rice and beans. Both burritos were fantastic. The salsa bar was a great addition to our meal. Some spicy sauces as well as sour cream were included. 
The one thing that would have put this little Mexican place over the top would have been the addition of chips. I guess next time I will have to order some. Our entire meal came to under $20 with he two burritos and waters to drink. 
I will defiantly be back to try more."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about trying this place on account that it looks like a fast food drive thru, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. 

I ordered the Mexican torta with carne asada. The bread was a bit soggy but other than that, it was good. My mother-in-law ordered the verde chicken enchiladas, my husband ordered a carne asada burrito, and my father-in-law ordered some carne asada tacos. All of them enjoyed their food.

I would recommend this place if you're craving cheap Mexican food. The service is incredibly quick, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try... I don't like writing super long reviews, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  Food was very tasty and fresh, restaurant was clean with some fun/lively decor, and staff could not have been any nicer! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered carne asada taco, lingua taco, enchiladas and salad. We liked them all, good food. Lots of option of fresh salsa and they also have some bottled house sauce. The place is clean and service was good"}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this place out and glad I did.  Salsas are amazing and entree was just as good.  I had the cheese enchiladas.   They come with refried beans which contain bacon so if you are vegetarian opt for the black beans."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out and give it a chance. We ordered two burritos and churros. We got our order and left. Turns out we only had one burrito when we got home but we were charged for two! Called them and got hung up on. Called again and they let the phone ring for more than 2 minutes. I didn't care. I put my phone on speaker and waited. Worker finally answered and told me that the chef FORGOT my other burrito and they'll throw in extra churros. Whatever. My boyfriend arrives to pick up my burrito and they hadn't even made it because they ran out of chicken?!!!!! Not acceptable! I don't even want anything else at this point. We got a refund for only one burrito and went to Del Taco. NEVER coming back here ever again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Looks like a chain restaurant, eats like a sit down place. I was very pleasantly surprised when we stopped, on a whim, to grab some dinner. I had the pork Serrano burrito and the wife had the chicken burrito cup. Both were excellent and the quality I expect in a table service restaurant, this time without the wait. Staff was friendly and courteous, I have zero complaints. The restaurant seems prettt open and authentic, and the salsa bar is well stocked with some of my favorites. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best shrimp enchiladas I've ever had. And I've had many.  Also, arguably the best chips and salsa I've ever had as well.  They make 5 or 6 different kinds that are available in a bar type of thing.  The horchata was excellent as well.  From the outside of the building, you would think it was like Del Taco - and it is next door to a Del Taco and shares the same parking lot of Sunset.  However, it is nothing like Del Taco. It is super top notch Mexican food and the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with red and white walls that say cool things.  This is my new go-to Mexican joint in Henderson as of right now at this very moment."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish burrito and my boyfriend ordered the flautas. The lady working must not like her job because she seemed upset to be there. Their salsa was pretty bad due to lack of flavor and spices. The fish burrito was the worst burrito I've ever had. The fish was crunchy and dry and the tortilla was soggy. The rice appeared to be an attempt at Mexican rice. It had absolutely no flavor to it. Very disappointed with the food. The bathroom was disgusting. The sink was filthy and appeared to have not been cleaned properly in a long time. There was a giant pile, of what appeared to be, wet toilet paper in the corner of the floor. The grout on the floor tiles were supposed to be a light color was now black from years of grime and filth. There was yellow spots of some substance that had been sliding down the walls. Would not go again. I'm surprised at the decent reviews of this place because it's the worst Mexican food I have ever had. They get 2 stars because their beans are decent and their pico was good."}
{"text":"2/18/2018  CLOSED....I went to Serrano's on Sunset for lunch and there was a sign on the door saying it was closed and to look for a re-opening in the future.  I liked this location, and I wish them luck and hope to see it re-open in the future."}
{"text":"So good. Got order to go and they brought us chips to have while we waited. Staff is nice. Place is quaint and clean. Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, terrible service

I usually order 2 chipotle shrimp tacos (SO GOOD) and load it up with some salsas from their big salsa bar, and surprisingly 2 is enough to keep me full! However my most recent trip here is the reason why they are not receiving a 5-star :/

Last Thursday my girlfriends and I were looking for some late night eats close by and saw Serrano's was still open. Having eaten here numerous times before and loving the food we decided to go here. We arrived at 9:30 and I immediately approached the cashier lady since I always get my usual Chipotle Shrimp tacos. Now I'm not all anal about being greeted and all that jazz but I pretty much greeted myself to this girl and started telling her my order. As I was saying, \"I want Chipotle Shrimp tacos\" She interrupted me in this rude tone and said \"Is this gonna be to-go cuz like were gonna close in 10 minutes.\" First of all, there was plenty of time for me and my girls to down 2 tacos each under 30 mins, and second of all, it was 9:30, you close in 30 minutes, not 10 but I don't make the rules. I then agreed to take it to-go and then we had an awkward silence and I thought she was waiting for me to order more and so I said \"Well, that's it\", completing my order. She gave me a dirty look like \"That's it what? Like what are you talking about, you didn't even tell me anything\" like I was stupid or something. Fcking HELL NAH. First of all if you weren't so focused on what time you were getting off MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ME WHEN I ASKED FOR 2 SHRIMP TACOS. Freaking rude. If you know me, I'm too nice to say anything like this in person but just typing this review out makes me wish I had said something.

Overall she was just giving off terrible vibes. You could tell this girl hates her job and just wants to get off, which is fine but don't take it out on your customers. She could have said things in a nicer way but that's in a perfect world. It's because of service like this, I will not return as often as I'd like, no matter how good their food is. And I seriously love their food, I would recommend the food. But watch out for cranky cashier girl!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service . We bearly started our appetizer and they were already bringing us our main dish . The food was real good, well prepared and the salsas were out of this world. If you're looking for great Mexican fast food try this place."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact this is a converted Taco Bell fool you. My meal was fabulous. I had a steak taco for 2.50 and recieved 3x the meat a typical steak taco would have, good start. It was a very simple yet tasty taco that I excentuated with one of the numerous fresh salsas. Then I followed it with a chicken enciladas suiza. 8.50. Its served with fresh rice and beans. I'd like to point out the rice and beans were actually very good. Not a dry afterthought like 90% of Mexican restaurants. The enchiladas were smothered in a delicious green sauce and some of the best I've ever had. Truly felt like I was eating a expensive, high end strip Mexican meal but even better. I'll definitely be back to this little gem"}
{"text":"Since our favorite Mexican restaurant recently closed we've been on the hunt for a good replacement. Last Sunday after church we tried Serrano's. 

They open at 12 on Sunday so we decided to hang out 'til they opened as we also had a Groupon. Unfortunately, a few cars had already pulled in then left before they opened.  

It's a cute eatery with creative decorations, nice salsa bar and plenty of hot sauces to indulge in. 

The menu was also extensive but I decided on the ceviche, shrimp enchilada and some shrimp street taco's to take home for later. Initially, they said they didn't have any shrimp which would have been a deal breaker but the server quickly recanted saying it would just take about 15 minutes to prepare the shrimp. 

My Hubby got the steak topped french fries, enchiladas and some street taco's for later as well. 

The food was very enjoyable, generous portion of shrimp & meat along with a great sampling  various salsa from mild to extra hot. Besides the sliced jalapenos they even had habaneros! YAY! And with the Groupon it was an excellent value. 

Unfortunately, when we returned this past Sunday, things didn't fare so well. As the clock ticked past 12 about 4 other cars that were in the parking lot left. Once inside, another couple left because they didn't have menudo although there was a sign on the counter and on the menu. This time we were only getting some street tacos - some to eat there and some to take home for later. Upon ordering my shrimp tacos I was told there was none prepared however, if we didn't mind waiting it would be about another 15 minutes. So, obviously, they don't come in early for any type of food prep. We had almost finished our street tacos when the server came and asked if we wanted her to start preparing our taco's to go. Seemed odd since the prior week they brought everything out together. Needless to say, after a bit and getting a bit anxious to get out of there, I went to the counter to see how much longer our order would take. I was told our order would be out shortly, and she very politely apologized saying they were having a very bad day.  That's understandable as we all have them - just hate seeing a small business losing patrons because of it. Anyhow, as we were trying to leave, the exit door stuck. We tried turning the lock and everything. STUCK. Asked the server for assistance and after a bit of a struggle she was able to force it open. That's when I also noticed the big long crack in the glass. Guess they really were having a bad day. Hoping everything smooths out for them as the food, at least what we tried, was enjoyable."}
{"text":"A happy mixture of nicer dinning in a fast food place. The food is very good and the inside is friendly. Don't judge the place by the fast food out look outside. Very glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"This is our second time in and the food is pretty good. I had street tacos the first time and they were great. 

This time I went for cheese enchiladas. I got one green and one red. The red was not appealing to me at all but the green was absolutely delicious. I cannot wait to have these again! 

The honey had the Baja shrimp salad which was good but seemed a little on the small side for the price.

The salsa bar is awesome! I like spicy stuff but I wanted to be safe so I got mild and pico de gallo which I mixed and made one DELICIOUSLY PERFECT salsa. I put that on the red enchilada and it made it better but when I mixed it with the rice it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! 
I don't love rice but I could happily make a meal out of that rice with the mix-in.  I probably won't do that because nothing is going to keep me from having more of the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. Oh wait!!! To-go!!! I can have BOTH!!! Color me happy! 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really tasty authentic Mexican fare. I've never been disappointed by what we've had here."}
{"text":"Greasy food.  Decent service.  I would not recommend you come here.  I feel sick as I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"Great authentic food for a really good price.  The street tacos and the enchiladas were amazing.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! I took my sister to lunch and we had the Street Tacos (Lengua, Shrimp, Pastor, Asada and Chicken) . Everything tasted great! 
I think our favorites are Asada, Shrimp and Pastor.

 I really like the fact that they offer suggestions on how to pair the sauces with the tacos.


I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I was hesitant at first being that I am Mexican and I know good Mexican food when I try it. I really love the food. It's authentic and the service is great! Very friendly. I also love the fact that they have a drive thru! That comes in handy when you have kids, are in pjs or avoiding the Vegas heat lol I highly recommend this place. I personally love the steak tacos and the enchiladas suizas (chicken) I also have to say that the place was extremely clean! A+"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican places in Henderson that I have tried so far.

Salsa is really good with a good variety to choose from with mild and hot salsas.

Food is really great with awesome service.  Reasonably priced with a good vibe to the place.  They bring the food to your table after you order."}
{"text":"I dont know if it was because it was late but the girl who took our order didn't seem happy to be there. Had the steak Torta. $7.99, for this price they could put a lot more meat. It tasted great, but no one wants to eat just bread with a lil smeer of frijoles. The decor is great. I will give it another shot and see if experience is different next time."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican spot in Vegas and I've eaten EVERYWHERE. The grilled chicken and steak is perfect, I always get the traditional enchiladas or the chicken nachos. The fresh salsa selection is extensive and never disappoints.

If you want to try something new come here! You will be pleasantly surprised and become a regular. I live in Southwest Vegas but make my way to Serrano's often. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Second time here. My fiancé and I ate lunch the other day and tried a few things. Tortilla soup ,  Chicken Tacos and Chips and Guacamole. All were very good and would definitely re-order. The soup is one size and more a large bowl so good to share. The food is flavorful and has some spicy to most dishes which I prefer. Tried the chicken enchiladas this evening and thought they were as well very good. I'm glad this is open. Good lunch spot and dinner. Easy to find. Casual atmosphere. They did a good job to make it not look like the Taco Bell it used to be. Go check it out. Not on a date nite but take a look for lunch or dinner. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is clean which is great since its a food place. I had the cheesecake chimichanga and omg it was heaven!! The service is awesome too. Food is nicely priced and you get a good portion. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Serrano's Mexican Grill is our favorite neighborhood restaurant!  It's great food, friendly service and so clean!  We love coming here!  The guacamole is the best I have ever had!  I recommend this place for any meal!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!
Had street tacos and they were good and inexpensive! Seating was tight b/c two big groups were in the middle of the place but that just makes it more family like. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to the tortilla soup! I'm normally not a soup person, especially when it's 80 degrees outside, but this soup is muy delicioso! I've eaten it three times this week already!  Can't really comment on the rest of the food since this is all I order and it's filling enough that I don't need anything else. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and said they were really good and some lady across from us had this cheesy, dip looking thing that looked amazing."}
{"text":"Great tacos and tortilla soup. Loving the salsa selection.  Prices are reasonable and food is great. Good for families, quick lunch or quick dinner."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon to try out here. Serrano's seems relatively new in the area in Henderson. It looks like it used to be a Taco Bell, except I can tell you the food is better here than the old Taco Bell.

Everything looked clean in the joint. They had decorated for V Day which I thought was cute. The menu seemed pretty thin. I'm grateful that it didn't have a thousand options, but none of the options really spoke to me. I went with the Serrano burrito and it was fine. It doesn't go much further than that with the description.

The salsa bar though was great. Different styles of salsas (somewhat labeled) were there for the taking. The other items in there did not look old and gross like these bars have a tendency of doing. And the food was pretty quick to get and go. 

There really isn't anything wrong with the place. It's a decent little set up, nice people and a somewhat limited menu. Living near UNLV, there are tastier places to stop by in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't knock Serrano's if you were in their neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Reasonable prices! My go to for Mexican food in Las Vegas. Everytime I go there I try something new and have yet to be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great, another (relatively) new restaurant that would've been awesome back in my school days.

This location of Serrano's Mexican Grill is the first one outside of Alaska (I know, right?) and it has been open for almost a year and a half now. I blame the abundance of other good Mexican restaurants all over town for my delay in trying them. Recently, I acquired a Groupon and decided to mosey on over for lunch.

I'm no expert on Taco Bell, but you can easily tell they took over what used to be a fast food joint. You order at the register then either take your food to go or find your own table. They replaced the menu with a single menu board, with simple descriptions but without photos. There's a mishmosh of Spanish words/phrases all over the walls. Music is all in Spanish too, including an older Shakira tune that I recognized.

They do have sufficient salsas for most of their foods, but be prepared and willing to add your own. Sandwiching the soda fountain are an extensive salsa bar and a wall-mounted shelf of bottled chili sauces, including a decidedly non-Mexican bottle of Huy Fong Sriracha. I declined to use it this time, but maybe I'll play around next visit. As for the salsa bar, they list ingredients, heat level (although the molcajete salsa was much spicier than advertised), and provide a chart of recommended pairings by meat. Very newbie-friendly!

My first order (and coincidentally the first item to arrive) was a mere cup of tortilla soup ($2.45). My soup came with generous chicken and pork that were complemented by crunchy tortilla strips and smooth avocado. Although it could've used one or two more levels of flavor, it was definitely not underseasoned. I'm definitely going to consider getting a bowl next time.

I went with some tacos next, although not my ideal selection because they were out of shrimp. The salmon ($2.75, new item) came with shredded cabbage and was undersalted, but salsas helped cover for this issue. The pastor ($2.25) lacked any sort of grilled fruit or veggie, but they were tender and flavorful enough on their own. The lengua ($2.50) was surprisingly solid, not the most flavorful but better than their appearance.

I was most impressed with the enchiladas tradicionales ($8.99), aka enchiliadas rojas, which I ordered with steak. The enchiladas had tons of flavor from the cheese and red salsa, but the meat was delicious, seasoned, and tender (aside from two overly chewy bits). The rice was a little dry but not overly so. The refried beans were delicious.

Unfortunately, they were out of the listed desserts, so I'll have to wait for another visit to try the flan or cheesecake chimichanga. I wasn't in the mood for the churros, so I left without savoring something sweet.

Serrano's is a really good casual Mexican spot that will probably lure me back even without Groupons. It's worth a try if you're in the area and aren't craving other food options such as fried chicken or Hawaiian plate lunches."}
{"text":"I've been wanting some good tacos for some time now. The kind that places like Roberto's just don't have. I remember seeing Serrano's driving down Sunset and figured I should give it a try for once. I knew going in that I wanted tacos but the menu has so much good stuff that I started to second guess myself. But I said to myself \"No, you came for tacos so get your tacos.\" 

Tacos I got. Three to be exact. One pollo. One pastor. One asada. My own personal trifecta when I try new taco shops like this. A good way to compare all the places I've tried. Having sampled and judged my tacos tonight, the verdict is in. The pastor taco was crazy oily. The pork was well seasoned and tender but swimming in grease. It poured out of the two tortillas like water from a fountain. Now I'm not one to shy away from a greasy bite but this was a bit unappetizing even for me. The asada taco tasted a bit off. Maybe just under seasoned. I added a dash of salt which is highly irregular for me. In hindsight I should have added some of the salasa from the nearby salsa bar. The meat was tender though. And finally the pollo taco. This was my favorite by far. Tender chicken with a good char grilled taste. Perfection. Each of these tacos was topped with chopped onions and cilantro which I fully endorse.

Were I to go back some time, I may try a burrito. I saw another customer there with a burrito and it looked solid. And the rice and beans were calling to me too. As for the tacos, I am still hungry and they cost me $7 plus the cost of a drink. Kind of steep for for a meal that did not fully satisfy. I will say that the $2.25 for pollo and pastor and $2.50 for asada is about average when compared to other places. I just wish I were happier with my meal overall."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't say enough good things about this place! We discovered it a few days ago and have already been twice. We took our family tonight and it was a big hit with everyone. First time we went, I got the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The chicken was so soft and flavorful. The beans were really good. I had a steak taco and the tortilla soup the second time around. The soup was amazing! I think I might dream about it tonight. The big chunks of chicken, cheese and avocado are amazing. The broth is flavorful and good! We love the salsa bar and how amazing is it that they have sour cream on the salsa bar?! Who gives free sour cream?! Places normally charge for anything extra like sour cream but here, you get all you want for free! The horchata is so freaking good! Icy cold and extra cinnamony. Yum! The decor is awesome and creative. I love the hanging basket lights and really love the drawer and cupboard fronts up by the registers. Super cool. It's clean inside and inviting. The staff is awesome as well. They totally hooked us up with a free dessert to try. They gave us the cheesecake chimichanga which was delicious of course. It's a fast food feel at first but once your food comes, you feel like you are in a sit down, quality restaurant. They use real silverware and nice plates. I would highly recommend trying it out. It's going to become a family favorite of ours. Inexpensive but so so good!"}
{"text":"Really good food and for really good prices! SO MANY sauce options. I ordered a fish burrito which was the bee's knees and the tacos were good too. I would recommend getting the chips too cus they were dank.  this place so so swanky !! They have a sauce bar with really good PICO DE GALLO!!!!!! 
 P.S. the Tamarind water tastes like the BLUE Jolly Rancher"}
{"text":"Today we were looking for an inexpensive place to have some Mexican food. We decided to try Serrano's. The chips and salsa were fresh. The Baja shrimp salad was great! A large portion and prepared to order. The special of two tacos, rice, and beans was a great deal at $5.99. Centrally located in Green Valley, casual, and clean a great place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"We came to this place because of the great yelp reviews. We were pretty impressed, the food was good, I had a chicken taco and my husband had a burrito, it came out fast and was fresh. No complaints! We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch based on your previous review's.  The stink was so disgusting i couldn't even order.  I think the County needs to check on sanitary conditions here.  YUCK!"}
{"text":"Okay, so when they first opened, I have to admit that I was not that interested. They took over a previous business, and I just wasn't into trying this out. MISTAKE! This place is not what you would expect. 

The interior is so nice. It is as if you are eating at your own home. You are given real silverware and plates, not cheap plastic. The ambiance is relaxing and homey. The worst part was the cashier. She looked as if she could care less that we were there. No smile, no welcome, nothing. My husband thought that maybe she had difficulty understanding us? My interpretation was that she just didn't care. 

But the food is what got us. The beans were excellent, and the food was so flavorful. It came out nice and hot. We loaded up with sauces and limes at the little bar, and they even have a selection of hot sauces in bottles placed on the wall next to the bar. 

This is a really nice place, go and check it out!"}
{"text":"The interior and atmosphere is very inviting. The food was very tasty and staff is very considerate and patient. The interior and the way it's decorated gives off a cute vibe. I go to school down the street and will most likely come after school some time with my friends. I will definitely recommend to my family as well."}
{"text":"Everything seemed super tastey and fresh. Nice staff too. I hope this new place does well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"On the Yelp website it states Serrano's opens @ 11:00 AM on Sunday.  We are in the parking lot @ hours on the door for Sunday states 12:00 to 9:00.  Yelp needs to correct it's hours."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly pretty good. The food was amazing and the service was very nice and friendly. Would definitely go back if we didn't live on the other side of town."}
{"text":"On hot days, I crave soup to lower my body temperature. The reviews of the tortilla soup were convincing and tempting to try. No disappointment here. In fact, it exceed my expectations. It's a very generous portion- so much so that I wasn't able to eat it all- a little broth left behind. It has a very light tomato base, not ketchuppy the way some are. The chicken is grilled then added, so the blackened seasonings soak into the broth, adding to the several depths of flavor. It is loaded with chicken, fresh avocado and the Mexican cheese. The tortilla
Strips are added so they soften, adding more flavor and easy to eat. I could eat this every day. But I also hope they offer pozole someday, as that is my favorite. 
They also have an impressive and extensive salsa bar. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I've ever had, I'm never going back, the menudo was terrible no flavor at all, the torras were made with bread from days ago. Wasted money"}
{"text":"If I died right now, i would be happiest man alive. Best street tacos I have had in Vegas. It's the best way, amazingly marinated meat, cilantro, onion a touch of lime and leave it alone! No cream based stuff, or massive slabs of avocado mush.. Lol"}
{"text":"Good place like the food, had the Chicken Caesar-Chipotle Burrito. large with beans & rice. Neat/cool looking decor you never know they took over an old Taco Bell across the street on Sunset from Galaxy Theater. Higher in price than Taco Bell but way better...:) Yeah definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our first time eating here.  We bought a Groupon to give it a try.  Ordered the enchilada suisza and carnitas tacos.  Both were delicious.  Loved the tomattillo sauce.  Next time we are in Vegas, will be back."}
{"text":"The 1 star is for the service. As far as the food, their goal is to prepare it like authentic mexican food. However, it's an epic FAIL.... The beans are the star of the show here. The meat is plentiful, but bland and chewy. The meat is supposed to be the BASE of the meal. Smh The rice was also flavorless. WTF is going on here??! I read the reviews and decided to eat here because everyone says the food is so good. You have failed me my fellow yelpers, I'm very disappointed. This place is worse than Robertos. I left very full because I was starving, but not happy. Very sad, I drowned my sorrows at Baskin Robbins across the street. Anyone else, DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THESE REVIEWS!! Save yourself the heart ache & go to Los Tacos, hell even Tacos El Gordo will do."}
{"text":"I have tried Serrano's 2x now, since their opening. 1st time I had the Serrano's burrito, and this 2nd time the Cuban Sandwich.

The Serrano's burrito, (chicken), was quite good...the chicken had a char-grilled flavor, not just some chicken thrown in a tortilla. the other ingredients tasted fresh, and the burrito was off the grill hot. It came with sauce and cheese on top, so eating with a fork was needed....I do prefer hand held, so next time I will ask for nothing on top.
The burrito does come with rice & re-fried beans...I need to see if they will substitute black beans.
(again, my preference)

The Cuban sandwich was amazing good....for a \"Mexican\" restaurant. 
It was a perfect mix of hot pork, ham & meltded cheese with a chilled dill pickle & mustard. 
it comes wirh fries.

The restaurant it self is a old Taco Bell if I remember right. it does look nice inside, clean & inviting. The service at the counter was friendly & pleasent.

The salsa bar is great. a couple of differant \"hot\" choices, unlike others who only have 1 or no \"hot\" salsa to be had. it also has a habernero/onion mix which is amazing! if your not a fan of \"spicey, hot\" items...stay away :-)

Over-all, both of my visits were pleasent with tasty food."}
{"text":"This spot was a pleasant surprise. The food is tasty, fresh, and sit down restaurant quality. 

I have to admit that I was a little hesitant based on the outside appearance of the restaurant, but I'm very glad that I came in anyways. The décor isn't fancy, but the restaurant was very clean. 

Orders are placed at the counter and then you find a seat so that your order can be brought to the table. The woman that took our order checked on us several times after bringing our food over which was nice. Both employees we encountered were friendly and seemed to have pride in their restaurant. 

Both my husband and I enjoyed our food. I loved the salsa bar which had more than a dozen options. I limited to three salsas and they were all tasty. The salsa bar had nice descriptions of the various salsas including heat levels. I had a carnitas taco and chipotle shrimp taco with black beans and rice. Yum! The carnitas was tender and had a great flavor. I loved the sauce and generous amounts of shrimp, onion, and cilantro on the chipotle shrimp taco. My husband said he loved his chorizo burrito. I found the portions to be the perfect amount. I felt like I had enough food for the cost, but it wasn't a ridiculous portion where I was eating past being full.

I'd definitely recommend this spot to someone looking for sit down restaurant quality without the wait!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for another great referral!! I have been here a few times and seem to stick to the same thing because it is excellent! Their salsa is also delicious, and I'm kind of a salsa snob, but it is always fresh with great consistency. The enchiladas suizas are my go to item, as you pretty much can never go wrong with it! 
Update: Their drive thru is now operational."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional tex mex, beautiful view,great drinks. A little pricy, but worth a visit.

Dinner for 3, 4 drinks and tip less than $100."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican choices.  Looks like a fast food place when you walk in,  but it is not. Great service,  friendly employees."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp we decided to go to Soriano's and we got there it look like the chain restaurant and we where undecided on whether we want to go in We were pleasantly surprised on how authentic and good the food was. I got the chicken enchiladas Verde and my wife got the chicken enchiladas red sauce both were awesome and any place that serves habanero peppers is all right with me. They also have a really great selection of salsa and hot sauce. The people that work there are very nice."}
{"text":"Great little gem right across from the Galaxy theater most people don't know about this place yet so it's not crazy busy. I love the chicken tacos and fresh salsa the Carne Asad a fries are delicious. Everything going seems fresh right down to the beans and rice you should definitely give this place a look in if you are looking for a meal before or after a movie."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Very very very good food. Good service and nice that you can see the kitchen and watch flames rising. Had the fajita burrito with steak, excellent."}
{"text":"I love their Argentinian Sandwiches they have. Close to work and fast service , very professional."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great for the price. The meat was flavorless and bland. Salsa bar was decent and customer service was ok."}
{"text":"For a fastfood mexican restaurant this place is great. The enchiladas were super tasty and my husband's burrito was really tasty as well. They have a great selection of salsa and a big menu to accommodate everyone's taste. I like it better than some of the other fastfood mexican places in town."}
{"text":"After a much anticipated time, I finally had the chance to try this place with some of my friends. I personally ordered a shrimp taco & nachos...the shrimp taco was OK and that was probably because I didn't visit their salsa bar and top my taco off with some salsa. As for the nachos, I was a bit disappointed in how the cheese was completely dried onto the chips...it wasn't nasty but just too hard. I expected gooey cheese and pico de gallo, etc. However, this order was to-go which is probably why I'm not docking another star. I do hope to re-visit and update my review!"}
{"text":"\"Happy National Taco Day!\" or \"Happy Taco Tuesday,\" is a greeting I would like to have heard when I walked inside Serrano's yesterday on National Taco Day. But No! The cashier greeted me with, \"Hold on a second\" when I was about to ask about what comes with the two street Taco combo advertised on the window. Evidently I was supposed to know that the cashier was listening to a drive thru customer on her ear peace. A couple of minutes later she would apologize to me at the salsa bar alleging that she was talking to all these people at one time. The thing was that it was dead at 2 pm on Tuesday, October 4, 2016. I was the one dine in customer in the restaurant and there was a guest taking out and an older model vehicle at the drive thru when I walked in. The other thing was that when I looked through the plate glass window, I saw Del Taco, which might of been the better choice to celebrate National Taco Day. First impressions are an amazing thing and really set the customer's mood about a place. 

   If I had been celebrating National Taco Day at this spot that sits across Sunset Road from the Galaxy Theater, it would be inside a Taco Bell. A few years back, this very space was a Taco Bell. Apparently Del Taco conquered Taco Bell in the fast food taco wars in this neck of Henderson. If I am not mistaken, Serrano's replaced Taco Bell in December 2014. This is the second Serrano's. The original location is not south of the border but practically North of the border in Anchorage, Alaska. It is a compliment that out of anywhere in the world that they made Henderson their first location outside Alaska. When Serrano's expanded into Henderson, they did more than replace a Taco Bell. They converted the restaurant from strictly fast food to where customers order at the counter then the cashier gives them a glass to pour the beverage. They use Coke products. The customers are free to sit anywhere in the 2,574 square foot restaurant. Once the food is ready the cashier delivers it to the table on a plate with silverware. 

    The time from order to when the food arrived was around 15 minutes. From my table, I could see them make my food in the open kitchen. Seeing the cook in action, I knew that my street Taco meal was being made fresh. Up above I heard the music of Mexico playing. On this quiet day at Serrano's, I could also hear a pin drop. 

   The cashier was pleasant when she delivered my food. To answer the question about what a $5.99 two street Taco meal includes, it is beans and rice. Plus the meal includes any salsa topping from the salsa bar. The salsa is rated by the degree of hot. The salsa de habernaro was listed as very hot, the pickled habernaro peppers were extra hot, and the Pico de Gallo was medium. There were a few salsa toppings listed as hot. I'd compliment the two street tacos with a bit of spice. As my picture below shows, the two street tacos were the soft flour style and not the crunchy style. The meat was chicken. The street tacos were agreeable on the taste buds. The same with the rice and beans. As the picture shows they weren't the largest tacos or portion of rice and beans. Enjoying the taco on its National Day went by fast. 

   After all the times that I have driven by Serrano's, I finally got to try it using my Yelp 2016 National Day 25 Review Challenge to get me in their doors on National Taco Day. The only thing is that I don't know when or if I will be in their doors again."}
{"text":"I have been their twice for take out,for the wife and myself both times the food and the service has been incredible.the food I think can hold its own with anyplace in this area..the only draws back I can say is he decor it's noting to write  home about"}
{"text":"We discovered Serranos a while back and we keep coming back for more! Fresh food made to order, and a salsa bar with HOMEMADE salsa!  Price is right and great food!! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant a couple of times now. Interior is very nice and comfortable. Prices are similar to a Rubios but in my opinion the food is better and in spite of ordering at a counter, food is served on actual plates. Both times I have had the chicken enchiladas suizas and it was delicious. My husband has tried both the shrimp burrito and the carne asada burrito and loved them both. Their beans are hands down the best I have had. They have a wide selection of hot sauces and a pretty impressive salsa bar."}
{"text":"Do not let the outside look fool you, this place has amazing food. Our order was fresh made. Nothing was even pre chopped. Prices are extremely reasonable. This is a great option as a quick sit down spot. Our favorite was the chorizo taco. The chorizo was delicious!"}
{"text":"Chicken enchilada plate, menudo bowl, taco pastor and chicken tortilla cup of soup. All good, fair salsa bar. Good Mexican drinks too. For some reason the menudo came with out hominy, but was VERY fresh! A little crunchy even. Prices was very good too."}
{"text":"LOVE their Tortilla soup! Great service. Couldn't have been better :)"}
{"text":"Pozole and menudo are delicious! Portion is pretty big for decent price. 
Friendly staff and place is super clean"}
{"text":"Really good service. My parent's enjoyed their burritos that had really good meat. My vegetarian taco salad was good and I didn't see the beans I had in there came with bacon so the lady who you order from came up and told me. So that was really good."}
{"text":"Went there on Monday the 3rd. Food seemed to take longer for take out customers. Salsa/vegetable bar was empty. When asked to refill, girl told me to use cups provided which shows me she wasn't listening. 

I could overlook all this if the food was good. Seasoning was nonexistent. The shrimp tasted like nothing. I'm super disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"My family and I saw this place and decided to try it out. Very cute on the inside although it does not seem like it at first when you drive up. I had the enchiladas suizas which were very flavorful. My daughter had shrimp tacos and my honey had a sad tacos. My daughter liked her tacos and honey really liked the Asada tacos. The beans were good but the rice could have used a little more flavor."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing salsa bar, and fresh ingredients. Way better option then Del taco next door. The dining area was clean and inviting. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Wow, honestly when u saw what used to be a taco bell turned into a sit down restaurant my logic was like ummm no. But a push from my wife to follow the yelp reviews and try it has had me coming back enough to leave a 5 star review. The fajitas burritos and fish burritos are awesome, and the mix of flavors has me always wanting more even when my body tells me no. They have a solid choice of salsas and chile sauces. You order just like at a taco bell, but everything besides drinks is brought to you. I recommend this place when you want some good food while waiting for your galaxy theatre movie showtime."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't sooooo good I probably wouldn't come back. This place doesn't know what it is it's a fast casual with expensive plates and honestly not enough employees.  They bring the food out to you and if they ever get really busy they will lose customers to the lack of speed. Del taco is right next door guys.  If you want to make it you need to figure out what you are. Don't bring the food to the table call out a number. Ditch the expensive plates and go for paper plastic or something less artsy fartsy. The food is great but the execution really needs work."}
{"text":"We used a groupon coupon and we enjoyed eating at Serrano's. The food tasted fresh. I liked that the cheese quesadilla had fresh guacamole and a decent amount. I had the steak taco salad, and it was really tasty. The 4.99 nachos were fresh and yummy with a heaping size of guacamole in the middle. My husband had a burrito with chicken and he said it was really good. All of the food tasted fresh and the service was quick.
 The only thing to be aware of is that the enchilada dish has some jalapeno or chiles in it. We asked in advance and they said it wasn't spicy.  It turned out the dish was too spicy for our children to eat.
 So I would stick with the quesadillo, and the nachos and salads for the kids.
 I liked that their taco bar and had several different sauces, and the salsa also was delicious.
We would eat here again.  This was our first time eating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE eating here...2-3 times a month at least. It was my favorite place to splurge at but the last three times we have been here, the carne asada has been very dry and flavorless. The most recent trip here, we were given the smallest little containers for salsa after paying for chips and salsa. Total rip off. Very disappointed and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside, which looks like fast food joint, fool you. Though you do order at the counter, it otherwise is more like a restaurant experience. The decor is very nicely done and the food is restaurant quality. Many options on the salsa bar. 
My only minor complaint is that you have to pay for chips and salsa. Since the prices and food quality are not \"fast food\" it seems like the chips should come with the meal. 
The service was super friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, the restaurant is always clean and always great food. The bathroom could use some remodeling and the service can be hit or miss, but the great food, specifically the steak,  is always consistent so we keep coming back more."}
{"text":"Food is good and comes out quick. I love this place because it is one of the few places you can get Posole!"}
{"text":"Went here for Taco Tuesday. $2.50 for a SUPER tiny taco with cilantro, onion, and some meat. The taco was extremely dry. I bought guacamole for a dollar extra per taco, so basically $3.50 a taco, and it was given in those tiny condiment cups. I paid 19 dollars for 5 tacos and guacamole so I was more than surprised when I got my box and it was super light weight... only enough to feed one person, I was anticipating food for 2. Thoroughly disappointed with how expensive and dry the tacos were. Ended up having to supplement my dinner for two."}
{"text":"One thing I can't stand is poor service. First time in the restaurant because we were just told by a store near by how good the food was. Walked in straight to register with my mom and was awkwardly greeted by the lady behind the counter. I had my husbands order in my phone all ready to go so I started with his order first then added what my mom and I wanted. All together we must of had the most simplest order they've ever gotten. 1. Chicken Quesadilla (nothing extra added) 2. Plain French Fries 3. Bean & Cheese Burrito 4. Bean Burrito with unions 5. Chips with Guacamole... The lady behind the counter had trouble with our order for whatever reason and kept questioning us on our plain bean with unions burrito? Anyway....Had a feeling our order would be wrong just by the way she kept questioning our order so we sat down at a booth to wait for the food to be done so I could check it before we go. We waited about 10 minutes which was great considering they were cooking all the food fresh. When the order was done we looked inside the bag to find that they were missing the Bean & Cheese burrito. So walked up to the counter since no one was there and told the lady who couldn't comprehend why the order was wrong so I repeated myself again telling her there was no bean and cheese and she then said yes there is and pointed at the bag my mom had and said the bean and cheese IS in there! So I went and grabbed the bag from my mom and began taking everything out and opening every thing up and showed her that the burrito she was talking about was my moms PLAIN burrito. She then turned around and walked just a little ways away telling the guy who was in the kitchen. I walked back to the booth we were sitting at and waited for the food to be done, no big deal. Then she walked the food back and didn't say sorry for the mix up or anything and walked back. So I begin to open it up and its wrong again. Now I'm fuming. I walked there with the opened container containing a burrito with rice and beans on the side and inside the burrito was all kinds of stuff. I opened the burrito up in front of her and said this isn't right I just want a bean and cheese burrito, JUUUUST BEANS AND CHEESE. ( why is it so hard to comprehend? she spoke perfect english) So I stood there and watched her talk to the guy again for a full minute or so before he began to make it and stood there until it was done. FINALLY after watching him make a simple bean and cheese burrito it was done! Went home and realized they forgot the fries ( COOL! ) was pissed and called and chewed the girl out again. I'm really not hard to please it just pisses me off when I get horrible service. I will say though that the food was really great but unfortunately because of the shitty attitude the girl had I won't be going back or telling anyone about it."}
{"text":"The Enchilada sauce was so good it must be homemade like everything else.
The chef was very observant of all that was going on, maybe the owner? Lots of couples and families eating. Glad we drove over to check it out before the movies accross the street. Wish they had Chili Rellenos and Huevos Rancheros. They had a burrito chicken  Caesar sounded interesting.
Its not fast food! So get that out of your head. Stylish plates and silverware combined with nice paper napkins makes it nice yet casual. 
At first your suprised by the prices UNTIL YOU put the first bite in your mouth!  This food is made by a chef."}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple of times with co workers and every time has been great! 
The food is piping hot fresh, great flavors, and many options with with salsa bar and a large selection of hot sauce bottles.
They will even do custom orders if you ask, I got nachos but fries instead of chips.
The place is very colorful with lots of fun custom decor as well.
I was told the only other serranos is in alaska by one of the workers."}
{"text":"Go-to Taco spot!

Service - When we first started coming here, the service was great. Always friendly and patient workers. Yet, lately, the service seems to be going downhill. Workers are nowhere near as friendly, sometimes the cashier barely says two words and seems annoyed. 

Food - We get the Nachos with steak (comes w/your choice of meat), 2 steak tacos for the other half and 1 chipolte shrimp&1 chorizo taco for me. Always delicious. Only complaint is that SOMETIMES there is not enough meat in the taco. Salsa bar is filled with different kinds of salsa and even sour cream (I'm used to having to pay for the sour cream). 

So.. if you are looking for a place to stuff your face, but you want to leave with some money still leftover in your wallet - I recommend this place."}
{"text":"A casual, Mexican eatery that is not really comparable to anything else. A bit more upscale than a taco shop...but not fancy like Lindo. Not Tex-Mex, but more complex than a Chipotle. There is a drive-thru, but it's not your typical fast food joint. 
The shrimp tacos, tortilla soup, and french fries are delicious! These items are packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.
The steak torta (dry/bland) and Serrano's burrito (I've had better) are less impressive. 
Serrano's has one of the best salsa bars ever. I dare you to try the pickled habaneros. You'll be crying for milk! 
Some annoyances are several items were not available like the Gordo torta and pastor tacos. Also, awkward placement of the horchata dispenser (separate from the soft drink area). To get your horchata, you have to go through the ordering line. Weird."}
{"text":"Why did I just now discover this place!!! Got the chipotle shrimp burrito and tortilla soup! Both super delicious. Does not lack in flavor. Prices are great and they have a drive thru. Def coming back. Robertos who?"}
{"text":"Las Vegas area (and especially Henderson) folks, this casual new spot is a surprisingly must nosh. Excellent food, super nice staff and fun decor. Say hi to Maria and tell her Katherine ( who she met today) sent you :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time I had a burrito and a taco. Both very good. This time I'm trying the Cuban sandwich (Torta) and a chicken taco. I expect deliciousness!! And like many reviewers said, the salsa bar is very good and diverse. Support this place! It's WAY better than the junky Mexican food next door!!"}
{"text":"I received a free groupon and used it on this place (well, it was Cinco de Mayo sooooo).  I ended up using it a few days later and walked away very disappointed.  Ordered the enchilada verde plate.  2 scrawny enchiladas with rice and beans.  Enchiladas were bland and the rice wasn't very well done at all. Once again, very bland.  The best thing on the whole plate was the refried beans, so that's not saying much.  Also had the \"beef\" nachos.  Horrible.  That's all the effort I'm putting into this review.  Do not recommend and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has one of the greatest salsa bars I've ever seen!! Great tacos!! Also try the nachos and the torta!! Oh I almost forgot to mention the wide assortment of hot sauces available and the churros!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant.  It is a great change of place from the regular Rebertos, Chipotle and Cafe Rio.  The food is made fresh and served hot.  The menu is very simple and easy to follow.  Anything that you order from here will taste great."}
{"text":"The food was good and as a lover of all things spicy, I loved the selection of salsas at the salsa bar. The staff was very friendly and made the place feel welcoming. I had the horchata to drink and I give them an A+ it was great not too sweet , just right. 

My mouth is still pleasantly on fire from the habanero salsa... Yumm!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here for lunch but with all the major changes they have made over the last few months it's just not the same at all!!!

For instance, how is one supposed to dip their chips in a salsa cup the size of a mini Reese's peanut butter cup?  You CANT!!!"}
{"text":"My second experience based on the food was so much better. I got the Taco Salad with Steak, it was huge and packed with ingredients. When you think salad you think healthy, I don't think this one is. Not a lot of veggies in here, but so good none the less.
Now on to customer service. We had 6 orders to place to be ready by 12 so we called it in around 11:15 and we pretty much got scolded for calling to early, how do we know how long it'll take, how busy you are, etc ? He took the order be enforced the do not call early next time rule. We considered using them to cater our \"lunch and learns\" but now are second guessing our decision.
Pick up was smooth and friendly. All the orders were correct and labeled. Everyone liked their food."}
{"text":"Went to this place for cinco de mayo, and I know I know if you are reading this you are probably thinking of all the places in Vegas why would you go there for cinco de mayo!? Lol long story short we went here and we were basically on a hunt for the best deal for tacos. They had a cool deal it was basically 5 bucks for 5 tacos which I don't think you can really beat. Here's the catch though.... You had to buy a drink booooo! Right? So then your total still came out to about 8 bucks. Anyways I had a plan I was going to try their adovada, carnitas, and of course the classic favorite carne Asada. Unfortunately they didn't have adovada so I stuck with the other two.  The lady at the counter was semi friendly, it's as almost she didn't want to be there or if I was asking her for too much. Anyways their salsa bar was impressive! They had probably over 8 different salsas there and since I'm a salsa freak I had to try them all, which probably was pissinn people off because I had a lady breathing down my neck heavily lol. Reason for not giving this place 5 stars is simply this: the cashier girl was not friendly and the place was kind of dirty, I don't think anyone cleaned or touched the salsa bar all day! And even robertos taco shop does that!!! How did the tacos taste you ask? They were actually really good. Had the other things have fallen into place I would have easily given this place 5 stars. I could see myself coming back to this place maybe on a day that wasn't so busy such as cinco de mayo :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place but I am very happy I did. They get 5 stars for the freshness of the food, the flavor and they have a drive thru!!! 

I came around noon for lunch on a Monday and there was really no wait time. I had the special which was the original Serrano's burrito with chicken and rice and beans on the side. The rice and beans were very flavorful and I enjoyed mixing them together to eat (does that make me weird? Idc because it's delicious lol) I usually don't go for the \"wet\" burrito but man!!! This was better than I expected it to be and ended up eating half of that. They also have a salsa bar with everything you could think of to put on top of whatever you have ordered. 

I say give this place a try if you're craving Mexican food. I was not disappointed and I am super picky about Mexican food lol"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. The women who takes the orders when you first walk in is the rudest person. She taps her nails while you are trying to order trying to get you to hurry up, after 30 seconds of browsing through the menu, she rolled her eyes at me!! I ordered ( way over my groupon amount) but she was not happy about the groupon?! she snatched the rest of the money out of my hand! Such a rude women with a cruel face. She's so rude that it caused the otherwise yummy food to leave a horrible aftertaste. It's sad that the establishment lost a customer due to the staff of choice. Btw this was my third encounter with her, and surly my last."}
{"text":"I don't usually take pictures of food but this was pretty awesome for a fast food joint.  The food was served on dishes and the portions were huge! The tortilla soup was really good as well as the carnitas taco!  I docked one star because I didn't care too much for their beans and rice, they weren't bad, I'm just too picky! I loved the decor and they were playing all my favorite Spanish songs, I didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"I just finished a very nice dining experience at Serrano's. We ordered the cup of tortilla soup, chicken enchiladas, and a chicken torta. The service was good, the food was fresh and flavorful, and the price was fair. Although we dined in, the restaurant also has a drive-thru window if you'd rather have something to go. I'm going to make sure to come back and try some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The chipotle salsa that I had leftover from my yummy dinner was literally slathered all over everything i've eaten today. Salsa bar is phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"YUM.  I ordered the burrito cup and loved it.  My man had the chicken enchiladas. We would definitely come back.  Prices were really good.  We got a lot of well prepared food for our money. Service was FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"I was starting to become furious with Las Vegas and the Mexican cuisine that it offers. I'm from Cali and have traveled a bit so I am really picky with my food. I went through the drive thru the guy was very sweet and helpful. The chicken tacos was so fresh and tender. I also got the carnitas which was equally as good. The beans had a nice lil flavor. Now here's the reason I'm giving three stars my rice was really hard I could have made a maraca with it. No seriously! This place has so much potential I will definitely give them another try. Everything was so good I'm assuming maybe they left rice in chafer to long or under light. I will come back to update once I visit again. This is definitely a place worth trying."}
{"text":"How does this place have such good ratings? Flautas?? Nope, big rolled tacos. A $6 plain cheese quesadilla that I could have made in the microwave for $.65. I love Mexican food, but this was like Taco Bell with triple the prices. Stick to Robertos or Faustos .. or anywhere but here."}
{"text":"I've always driven by Serranos and wanted to stop by. Honestly, the best stop I have ever made in my life! The best customer service! I told the girl at the counter it was my first time going and she was super helpful as to what dishes they had and to please help myself to their huge salsa bar!! I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and carnitas nachos to go. The chicken tortilla soup is the best soup I have ever had!!! I couldn't stop eating!! I only ordered the cup size not the bowl and it was more than enough! The nachos were a big portion and they made sure to leave all the toppings on the side so they wouldn't get mushy which I appreciate! I went back within the hour to pick up my roommate some Carne Asada and Chicken Tacos! She ate two and saved two for breakfast because they were too good to finish and not have them the next day!! Haha!! Thank you so much, we will be back tomorrow!!! :)"}
{"text":"Good afternoon  everyone out here in Henderson  & Las Vegas area,  I just wanted to  put this out there. If you want to taste some AWESOME Mexican food, You need to get out the house and drive over to Serrano's Mexican Grill. I'm telling You that it's a drive That you'll want to.do again & again after you have tasted  the food here. 

The first time I visited this place was last year with my Daughter who came to visit from Briminham,  Alabama. She found this place on Yelp. That was my first visit to Serrano's Mexican Grill and I have the place 4 stars.

Well,  this place has been on my mind since last year and for some reason Or another I would get redirected and dive else where. Well folks,  today I just happen to be in the area getting my glasses repaired and as I looked over.to my right,  there was Serrano's. That's how I ended up here today an I telling you that I'm glad I did. I ordered the Chipotle Shrimp Burrito and that is why I have 5 stars today. The food today was better than I remembered.

Mr. JP  from S/E Henderson,  NV."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place, I was impressed! I had the cheese enchilada, my husband had the Cuban sandwich and we shared the nachos.  It was really, really good! But, don't use the bathroom...it was DISGUSTING!  A real letdown after a good meal!"}
{"text":"This place will not let you down!!

Beats Roberto's and Taco Bell hands down.

There's a bit of a wait but that cause it's cooked  to order."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!!  Theirs street tacos are highly recommended!  And the best salsa bar ever!! Pickled habaneros!!  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Friendly service but today the lights outsider off it did look close I went inside empty place we order a torta and a carnitas plater.. from the secret menu sssss don't tell anyone lol
It could be a bit more hot in temperature was good .
Salad bar super clean one the cleanes I see in Mexican sell service places 
Out the parmesan garlic fries..mmmmthe best .
We be back
Great food hoping more yelpers support this place and continue to be here for more years ..."}
{"text":"If you go inside once you will return for sure....salsa bar top notch every item we have ordered so far all have been great being in Vegas since 1988 on east side this is a must west side frank and finas Cochina top notch"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great! Feels like an authentic Mexican restaurant. Food was great and sauce was perfect spice."}
{"text":"This place is better than chipotle and robertos. The ingredients are fresh. The food taste great. My favorite so far are chicken enchiladas with the tortilla soup. The burritos are good also. I enjoyed the customer service and the salsa bar is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh, tasty and robust offerings have just made this place my new go to spot. It is a welcome addition in the area, which is a little limp on good options. We had the quesadillas, the Southwest eggrolls, and the tortilla soup. All of them were fantastic, but the tortilla soup was by far the best I have ever tasted! They marinate the meat for 24 hours, and all of the other flavors were so fresh and delicious. I hope that Serranos have much success and stays open for a long time!"}
{"text":"We had the Cuban sandwich,  was horrible and they make it fresh but not as real Cuba sandwich.
The juice was was removed from the out reach of the customers.
The place is clean, they bring the food to your table and they uses real plates not paper plates.
Staffs was very friendly and must definitely I will not return because they took the juice away from the customers ."}
