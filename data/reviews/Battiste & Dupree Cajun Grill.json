{"text":"Not worth the extremely high prices you pay for. Please book a ticket to New Orleans , you would find a cheaper deal than spending 15 dollars on an appetizer. Neither the ambiance is worth, nor the food."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and then stopping by for the seafood po'boy, I can confirm how wonderful this place is. As most reviewers have noted: the food is made to order, which is slow but fresh and worth the wait. Another selling point was the conversation and general friendliness that the owner provided. One last thing; the po'boy was $18 but worth every cent. You could feed 3 people with that monster of a sandwich. If you're in the neighborhood, take the time to stop in. You won't find too many places like this anymore."}
{"text":"To start let me give you one piece of advise. DO NOT make plans after dinner, expect to be there for a while. In true southern fashion, things move a bit slower here. Not out of negligance, but relaxation. With this said, the food here is fantastic! Junior runs a one man show and is more than happy to share a few words with you. The place seats maybe 25 and is very \"family oriented\" I would grade it a 5 if it wasn't so expensive and had a bit more elbow room. (50$ with an app and two entrees) But in terms of taste and authenticity, this place is spot on."}
{"text":"I have never seen business with more erratic hours than this place. After checking the website and Google and seeing that was open from 12 to 9, I got there at 1 and surprisingly it was closed?!?! After calling the telephone number to see if it was closed for good or if there was an emergency, the message said they changed their hours from 3 to 9, 5 days a week. That's 30 hours a week! That's not enough to even consider it a full time job! This is the second time I've tried to eat there, I found out the hard way they are closed Sunday and Monday the first time. There won't be a third try."}
{"text":"Battiste and Dupree is my kind of restaurant: AUTHENTIC delicious food, tucked away in a strip-mall, unassuming in a genuine and non-ironic way, and a 1-man show. The food is simply fantastic, even if it may take a while to reach you. No worries, though: take some good friends and really catch-up and connect with them over a delicious slow-paced meal! Turn off your cell phones and down a hurricane, try the crawfish etouffee, and be taken-in by Junior's charm and stories as he simultaneously cooks, waits tables, manages, and tends bar.  Try anything. Hell, try EVERYTHING. Everyone in my party tried something different and none of us wanted to share, it was all that good!  Don't complain about the \"slow service,\" you're in New Orleans now! Relax and put a little south in your mouth."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! How can food this good go unnoticed in Cleveland."}
{"text":"An odd thing to start a review with, but here goes- if you're in a hurry, don't come here. If you are used to northern, polished service, don't come here. Junior (the proprietor) will host you, seat you, take your order, and then turn around, walk to the kitchen and cook for you. He will converse with you as well and he is a pleasant man. If you want quick food, fast service, if you expect to be waited on at every moment, don't come here. That's my intro. The food is worth the wait, the atmosphere and friendships that can be created here is a beautiful thing. I recommend the chicken wings and the étouffée. If you're adventurous, the seafood poboy can feed about 4 people. Enjoy it with an Abita or one of Junior's mixed drinks. By all means, when you come here, relax. The food will come eventually. And it will be great."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles I've ever had.  Best fried catfish I've ever had. The food is salty and spicy, which some people don't like apparently. I happen to love it. My dad was eating his remoulade sauce for the fried pickles out of the bowl with his fork, if that tells you anything - I guess mostly that my dad needs some better manners ;)  The owner runs the whole thing - takes your order, helps cook the food (there is one woman in the back who did most of the cooking it seemed), buses your table.  And most importantly, he will chat you up in a non-annoying way. It just feels so authentic. You feel like he values your presence in his restaurant, he wants to learn about you, and he wants you to enjoy your food and drink. My parents are visiting from out of town and he wrote down directions to places he thought they would enjoy. Don't expect to be in and out of this place in a hurry.  Everything is deliberately prepared and it takes a while. The prices were a little higher than I was expecting, too.  But I think it is worth it for the experience and the taste."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Must try.   They use quality ingredients and the food is fabulous."}
{"text":"Just incredible. Genuine Cajun cuisine........from the Po Boys to the Gumbos and everything in between.....quality....quantity......and a religious experience in flavor melding. Very refreshing to be able to actually identify the flavors that are skillfully layered by someone that knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"This is \"Nawlins\" in Ohio! Yes, I've been to New Orleans, as well as many other cajun/creole restaurants on extensive business travel, and Junior Battiste's restaurant is right at the top with the best of the best. While traveling in the area, the restaurant came up on my GPS search.  Junior has a good selection of beers including New Orleans own Dixie and Abita. I started off with an Abita Christmas Ale. I selected the Chicken Remoulade entree - chicken croquets topped with remoulade sauce, served on maux choux (spicy cajun) corn with Jambalaya. This was a great blend of flavors that complemented each other perfectly. Finished up with a piece of Jamaican Rum cake, delicious! I will be going back to try more of their creations.  The restaurant is basically a small strip mall \"corner bar & grille\", seating maybe 8 or 9 tables, and a number of bar stools. Junior maintains a very casual but extremely friendly atmosphere with personal attention. It was very clear to me that he cares deeply about his restaurant, food and customers. If you like cajun and creole, you must eat here!"}
{"text":"The owner/cook/server is a little cooky but the food is FABULOUS! Perfect amount of spice and good beer selection."}
{"text":"Amazing each and every time. Just note that Junior is a one man show. It will be a little slow, but that is part of the experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's small but the food is good! Love the atmosphere... You can order to go, but I suggest to relax and stay awhile."}
{"text":"I am so conflicted by this place! I  have been wanting to try it for some time but could never figure out the hours. Alas my tastebuds tingled for a shrimp po boy and the place was open at the same time. Finally! It was midday on  sat and i decided to treat my grandma (native lousianian) to one too. 1.we prob should have called ahead;) sorry grandma 2. the owner cooks wait tables bus tables take take out orders,etc. The good: My shrimp were seasoned well. granda approved! The bad: They are slow as molasis(sp)  3.5 stars actually -for slow service, high prices though decent food"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but it came extremely slow. I came with my friends, but the restaurant can't split our check. :("}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food. We tried the jambalaya (fantastic!), the gumbo (even better!), and the General Jackson chicken entree which, if you like it spicy, is the meal for you (we *loved* it). Not to mention Junior, the owner, is super hospitable. He's extremely personable and will ask your name and remember it. We will be back! Make sure you try it if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  We are from New Orleans and this is the real deal! Junior is a great host.  Small place with plenty of charm."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic find! First time there! I went with my brother expecting your go-to creole place with 4 vats of the general \"Midwesternized\" drunken chicken, gumbo, etc...   This is not that! Battiste & Dupree is a quaint sit-down restaurant with the best creole/cajun food I have ever eaten outside of New Orleans, with one of the most warm and welcoming hosts, Junior!   My brother ordered the Chicken & Sausage Gumbo which he absolutely loved!   I had the Corn Maque Chaux which was light, spicy and delicious!   We both split the Chicken Etouffee which had what we think is hand breaded chicken in a wonderful etouffee with rice. We ordered it mild, and it still had a nice kick to it.   If you are looking for a fast food creole joint, this is not the place. The food is all prepared to order and comes out in courses. So make sure you have some time to enjoy. The food is definitely worth the little wait.   Junior gave us a taste of an item that was not on the menu. He called it Dirty Rice. I don't know what was in there, but it was heavenly! He says he usually makes it on Friday and Saturday, but he may be moving it to the menu soon. I highly recommend asking him if there is any Dirty Rice available on your next visit.   In conclusion, Battiste & Dupree is a fantastic creole/cajun restaurant with a wonderful host and owner! If you have never had creole food, I highly recommend trying it here! If you love creole food how it's supposed to be made, then this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in ages.  The service was glacial.  I ordered a house salad, but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available.  I ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty French dressing  We waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--General Jackson's Chicken.  The menu promises:  \"Boneless, marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy, savory sauce, served with jasmine rice, broccoli and napa\"  Spicey sauce?  This sauce was so spicy I was unable to even taste the chicken.  The rice was strictly Uncle Ben's and i saw no broccoli or napa.  We had a couple beers before the meal while waiting.. Total bill:  $55.  I'm not a tightwad, but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable.  Battiste and Dupree was not the \"hidden gem\" others had told me about.  Hope your mileage differs."}
{"text":"It's slow slow slow slow, and the guy that owns it is a weird motherfucker. But....... It's absolutely delicious, yes it's overpriced, yes it's painfully slow, yes the man that owns it has no idea how to run a restaurant. Having said that, if you have 5 hours to spare it's worth it"}
{"text":"Went for a 6 course meal for Mardi Gras. Was told to be there at 5:30pm only to be served the first course at 7pm. Each course took an additional 45 minutes to wait. We ended up leaving 5 hours later and had to get dessert togo. The whole event was disorganized as everyone was getting their food at different times. Also, the owner was doing all the cooking and running around thus the long wait but also he was not in the best mood. We were hesitant to ask for anything! He was rude when we asked for hot sauce. The red beans were barely cooked, still hard. The crawfish was boiled in salt water, no seasoning. I used to live in Houston, TX and have been to many different parts of Louisiana as well so I know that crawfish shouldn't taste like dirt and be served with a bunch of huge baking potatoes. Luckily I had good company to dine with since it was such a disaster...at $60 a person too!"}
{"text":"After being told to come here YEARS ago, we finally made it. I was sent here for the fried pickles, but I don't think they were as amazing as I was led to believe. I ended up unable to eat a lot of them because they were incredibly salty and the portion was huge. I got the cajun chicken nuggets from the appetizer menu and I don't think I've ever had better. My husband got gumbo, I believe, and it was amazing. I was a little jealous of his meal, but when I realized how perfect my chicken was, I completely forgot about how tasty his was.  The service was friendly and even though we were the only people in the place, we didn't feel like they were hovering over us or anything. This restaurant is truly special. I can't wait to come back and try some more complex dishes that really show how good they are at what they do."}
{"text":"What a gem.  Nestled in a small strip mall off Cedar and Warrensville Rd you will find this place.  A purely decadent and fun slice of New Orleans with multi-colored lights, unassuming decor, and downright damn delicious food.  How have I lived in Cleveland almost 2 years and not found this place?  We decided to sit at the bar.  Overhead the speakers were playing some oldie but goodies 70s music I had not heard in years.  The menu is extensive for such a small place...I chose the Cajun wings with sweet potato fries and the side of corn mache.  The boyfriend ordered a large salad with strawberries and a sweet/spicy basil vinaigrette and the Jambalaya.  The food is outstanding.  Everything is made from scratch and served with a side of Junior's (the owner) personality.  At the end of our meal we sat and talked with Junior for over an hour.  What a down to earth, humble man.  We have definitely found a new place to put in rotation...I mean, heavy rotation.  And for a true Nawlins experience, let Junior pour you a Hurricane."}
{"text":"Service was beyond compare.  The food was sensational.  If you like New Orleans style Cajun food this is a must stop."}
{"text":"If you are in the Cleveland area, this place is a must go. From the appearance on the outside you wouldn't expect much but a normal restaurant in Cleveland but on the inside, it is as if you are in a completely different universe. Easy laid back environment makes you feel as if you are at home. Junior (the chef) is a man of many hats, and is the cook, DJ, server, and owner. Even though he's the only man back in the kitchen and it make a little bit of time to get your food, the wait is worth it. The food is made perfectly, everything that is fried has the right amount of crunch but isn't too greasy, the dishes give you a clear sense of what new Orleans food is like, and it's because her takes the time to do so."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times, and was impressed each time with the level of attention paid by the owner to customers. Very friendly, and tries to develop a relationship with his customers. Would be five stars for a $-$$ restaurant, but four stars for a $$$-$$$$ restaurant. The decor, however, would get two stars. The dining area seats around 10-14 people comfortably. Very much a hole-in-the-wall, which I generally do not mind.  The food is okay, and gets points for offering fairly good cajun cuisine in Cleveland. I did not care for their jambalaya, but enjoyed the gumbo and fried chicken. The po boys are also good (for a po boy). Not so big on the owner's special sauces, but they are still palatable. Three stars if it were in New Orleans, four stars with the Cleveland adjustment.   My biggest objection are the prices. The prices could be justified from a business perspective given the amount of time it takes to prepare the dishes (typically had to wait 15-20 minutes for the first dish to come out after the order goes in). Plus, the owner takes the order, cooks the food, and buses the tables, so that it's mostly a one man operation (at least the times I've been there). However, this is not a justification I'd be willing to accept for a majority of the restaurants I go to. The reason why I keep coming back is because of the owner. I feel like I'm going to my uncle's house for dinner, where it would not matter how quickly I get my food. If not for that, I would give three stars overall."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks ago after (countless) recommendations from friends. I was a little underwhelmed by the actual place itself..... small with generic tables and chairs; the walls are covered in old photos of actors/singers/etc.. Service was nice but a little overwhelming, I think we had more conversation with our server than we did with each other; if I was sitting at a bar I wouldn't mind at all, but being seated at a table..... eh, I don't know.   However, the drinks and the food were amazing. We settled in with two of their 'house' cocktails (be forewarned- they will knock you off your seat, if they tell you not to stir it, consider yourself warned!) and ended up with a sampler platter of an appetizer. Ended up getting stuff on the app and never go to dinner...... I suppose we'll have to return to figure out what their real entrees are like."}
{"text":"I felt like i was back in cajun country again. Look Junior cooks the real deal hands down. He is a one man gang. SO IF THE PLACE IS PACKED BE PREPARED TO WAIT !!!!... ITS WORTH IT. New Orleans bbq shrimp and seafood gumbo my top picks."}
{"text":"3 stars according to Yelp means \"a-ok\", and that's exactly what this place was: okay. Just okay.  First, a little background on why I'm reviewing this place: having recently moved to Cleveland, I've been on the hunt for good restaurants, hair salons, decent shopping, coffee, you name it.  To my disappointment though, it appears that Clevelanders are not as Yelp-heavy as what i'm used to. Which sucks for people like me who have become so reliant on Yelp! So, instead of what I usually do i.e. bitch about the lack of local Yelp reviews, and then leech off other peoples' reviews without contributing myself, I am going to Yelp the hell out of Cleveland!!!! YES.  Battiste & Dupree, you are \"lucky\" #1 to be reviewed of Cleveland. And i'm sorry I couldn't give you 5 stars like all the other people on here (by the way, I don't really get why people are giving this place 5-as-good-as-it-gets-stars, when in reality, the majority of the 5-star reviews all caveat that the service is slow; If  there is even ANY area of opportunity, you probably didn't mean to give the place 5 stars, right??) *confused*  Long story short, I agree with everyone else that the food here is delish. I had the fried tilapia with beans and rice, and the bf had the catfish. No question here, the food is good; very flavorful. The reason I had to knock off two stars though, is that the service here is SO overwhelmingly slow. Like, think TWO hours slow. I could freaking drive to Columbus for the amount of time I spent at this place.  Yes, I get that Battiste & Dupree is small, locally-owned and is a hole in the wall spot, and obviously i'm not expecting mind-blowing service at a hole in a wall...butttt let me just highlight that at Battiste & Dupree, you are NOT paying hole in the wall prices (think $40ish for 2 people for entrees only). The owner is a nice guy and means well, but they need to seriously hire some help -- it just doesn't make sense to have people wait that long to have their orders placed; for food and for water to wash down the spicy food. This place is literally a one-person show; the guy does everything from cooking, taking orders, checking on customers, ringing people up. As good as the food is, at $40 for a dinner, spending 2 hours at a hole in a wall spot is not exactly at the top of my priority list...sorry, I gave the place a chance but i'll have to pass! :("}
{"text":"Still delicious food but sadly very slow service because only the owner is usually working and there's a good amount of people coming in for take-out. Waited 30+ minutes for our food, one of which is the something that's scooped from a big pot.   Also bit overpriced for the amount of food. The portions are small but generous on the ingredients. But due to the higher prices, can't eat here as much as would like."}
{"text":"Great local establishment in South Euclid. Come here if you want to relax and eat some good Cajun food! It's laid back with lots of pictures, Christmas lights, and New Orleans stuff on the wall. It's more \"hole in the wall\" feel with lots of wood paneling and a tv mounted in the corner. There's even a dining table almost partway into the kitchen.  I'm not too familiar with Cajun food, so I'm not quite sure how to rate it. I think I was between a 3.5-4. I shared the gumbo as well as the fried seafood platter. It was definitely a lot of food!  I think the owner is probably the best part about this place. It's basically just him who runs the place (and maybe even cooks some of the food?) He made the gumbo with an extra kick just for us, and it was gooood. The shrimp in the gumbo was JUMBO, and the other seafood in it was very tasty. The gumbo came with french bread dipped in honey with some herbs. He also gave us rice + beans with the seafood platter (not sure if it comes with it or not) and that was a nice addition to the seafood. We got shrimp, fish, and I think crawfish fried in a cornmeal crust -- not very oily (which was good) and very very filling. Next time, I'll get something more interesting since the platter seemed pretty standard.  My friend told me about it and when she came, she said it took her 2 hours to get the meal and finish it. For us, we had a nice time and it took around 1 1/2 hours for everything -- pretty standard. There was a bit of a wait, but then again, it's just this guy and a few people working the kitchen.  I think its worth it to come back and support this place as a local Cleveland establishment!"}
{"text":"Richard H hit it right on the money!   I walked into this restaurant with several business clients from out of town and no one was at the front to greet us?   We finally after 10 minutes seated ourselves.   Once we were at our table we did not have a waiter or waitress greet us for at least 20 minutes.   I got up to find someone to take our order and the manager/owner came up to us and treated disdainful asking us why we are here in a reserved seating section?   I told him that we waited at the door and then finally sat down since no one told us where to sit?   Once our party of 5 finally got our food- the orders were mixed up and the food tasted very bad.    I will never come back to this restaurant or will I tell any of my clients to come to this restaurant again.  I will report this to the better business bureau and an establishment that is lacking in customer service and poor menu options.    The owner needs to take a class on how to treat people or his restaurant will be out of business.  I cannot wait to tell 30 of my friends and have them tell 60 of their friends not to go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went there for 2 hours' waiting for a meal. And it is super expensive!! The host's attitude was super bad!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week and enjoyed the food and talking with Junior.  I had a pick two lunch combo; had jambalaya and catfish po' boy.  Supposedly it was a half sandwich but it was pretty large.  Jambalaya was tasty with just right amount of spice.  Junior was very friendly, and even brought out samples of other dishes for me to try.  I was very full when I left.    I will add that, like some of the other reviewers mentioned, this is not the place to go if you are in a hurry.  Each dish is prepared when ordered so it takes a little longer.  But the benefit is that the food was freshly prepared.  I'll take fresh over quick 9 times out of 10.  I will be going back, and plan to bring my wife and some friends."}
{"text":"Amazballs!!  Everything was yummo!! I hate the shrimp and it was really good cole slaw was out of this world!  Husband had the jambalaya dinner and all I can say was Wow!! Juniors bruschetta ... Try it and you tell me!!  We went @ 3 pm not realizing it just opened and Junior sat and talk with is like long time friends.  We will definitely be back!!!!  Took awhile for the food but well worth it!"}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry I would think twice about eating here as it takes quite some time to get your food. I tried the seafood gumbo and jambalaya. The food was fantastic. The owner was a very nice guy. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing Cajun food! Great service. Clean kitchen. Charming ambience. Friendly genuine owner/cook. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant thanks to yelp. Lived in Cleveland a number of years without ever knowing it was here, Called for a reservation and talking with Junior was like making a new friend on the phone.  Arrived hungry at 3 when they opened with no preconceived ideas, which I recommend all first-time diners do here. You know about the relaxed atmosphere and long wait so don't come and then complain on yelp.  Had planned to have Gumbo, Etouffee and Jambalaya but ended up with Chicken Remoulade and Jambalaya. I had to close my eyes when I tasted both as it was so good I'd only dreamed of Cajun/Creole food being so delectable.  Did not order any alcohol. I wanted to stay on my chair! Nor did we have rum cake. Couldn't hold another bite.  Junior's place is larger than a reviewer mentioned (5 tables.) It could easily hold 25 diners and a group will make for a fun time. This wonderful man cares deeply about his food, his restaurant and his guests. I admire him for who he is and what he does."}
{"text":"I may or may not write a full review for this place, but it definitely deserves 5 stars.  5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the owner. The seafood and everything tasted very fresh, apparently the owner picks out everything himself. We had a discussion on how to make cafe au lait too, really friendly guy!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! This is my first time here and Junior (owner) took care of me. I asked him for a recommendation on what I should get. Got the fried chicken dinner which comes with 4 pieces of chicken and red beans and rice. The skin was sooo crispy and full of flavor. Chicken itself was very moist and perfectly cooked. Not a fan of red beans in general but I'll definitely eat that any day."}
{"text":"This is a small place that has counter and stools but if the tables are full, I don't see how anyone can fit on the stools. Anyway, we went it was so cold the entire time. My boyfriend went to get my coat out of the car after we were there for 45 minutes because we hadn't even received the appetizer yet! We ordered gumbo, shrimp dinner and Polish Boy. The gumbo was decent and the shrimp dinner was over priced for portion size. The Polish Boy was way too hot for my son. I was under the impression that fries were served with sandwiches. No, two fries were served on the sandwich. Our food took almost an hour to get so we sat there cold. After awhile we asked for bread, which they brought us, but it isn't anything they seem to normally serve.   There is a Yelp check-in offer, but the owner wasnr aware of it and wants it removed. He gave us a 10% discount instead of the 15% offer posted.   Overall...we were there for 1.5 hours. We were cold and left unsatisfied. The owner was super nice and hospitable but I don't think we will be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Went for my first time today. Cajun perch dinner and seafood gumbo was authentic. The owner was the kindest person I've met. Everything was delicious! Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Best Cajun/southern comfort food I've eaten in Cleveland. Be sure to try the \"red beans and rice\" but only if you're ready for some fire. The service is leisurely."}
{"text":"Cajun Fried Perch w/AUTHENTIC Jambalaya & Fries were excellent! This is the REAL DEAL! The food was fresh & cooked to order. The owner, Junior was friendly and answered my questions about New Oeleans. When I mentioned to the owner I would be visiting NOLA soon,Junior offered to provide me with recommendations of places to eat off of the obligatory \"tourist path\"."}
{"text":"Like Cajun food? Never had Cajun food? You need to try this restaurant. Seriously. Do it.   This could be my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. It's that good. A small place, run by Junior (owner/operator/cook/bartender) The atmosphere is casual, with a stopping by a friend's house kind of vibe. It's relaxed in a way that would normally annoy me (Food can be slow for sure) but it's really just that southern attitude. My best advice, just order a drink, sit back and let the food get there when it does. It will be worth the wait.  The food itself, is amazing. Nothing on the menu has been a disappointment to me. Crispy fried fish, delicious po-boys, red beans and rice, the whole list is done well, with a homemade feel. The Jambalaya is as good as I have ever had. I have gone just to get that by itself. I highly recommend you try it.   The only real downside is that it is a little pricey, but It's not enough to drop my opinion from 5 stars, simply because the quality of the food, and the atmosphere in the restaurant warrant the cost."}
{"text":"Five hours later, can I have my night back? It was like being trapped in a time warp. I was a prisoner of dinner. We arrived at 5:30p for what was supposed to be a 5 course Cajun dinner. The first course came out close to 7p followed by another course every 40 minutes. We left before the last course arrived because we got a baby sitter for dinner not infinity. We left at 10:30p because we couldn't stay any longer. The crawfish were boiled with zero seasoning and no corn on the cob only massive potatoes and not red skins. The whole ordeal cost us $60 a couple but I would've paid him $100 If I could've left by 8p What can only be described as the longest and simultaneously the worst dining experience I've ever been a part of. I really wish I could put into words how upsetting and ridiculous this dinner was. I'll never be back. I don't understand how they have a business. No paper towels in the bathroom. A patron got locked in the bathroom and they had to take the door handle off leaving a whole in the bathroom door. We asked for hot sauce, they had to check if they had any and brought out a small soufflé with some Tabasco sauce in it... Cajun? Nah, CAGED IN! Just don't."}
{"text":"I've come to a realization recently. I don't like battered fish. No beer batter, no fish and chips, nope, not at all. I like fish, and I like things fried, so I kept ordering it thinking maybe I just hadn't found the right one yet. Then it dawned on me - I like cornmeal crusted fish!   I have a long love affair with Cajun cooking. My Papa was a Cajun, and man could he cook. I have grown up with the food and the culture (Zydeco music anyone?).   We tried a sampling of the menu - fried perch, fried shrimp, General Jackson's chicken, red beans and rice, coleslaw, potato salad, and fries. Everything was great! The fish was cornmeal crusted and crunchy, very flavorful. The red beans and rice were spicier than expected, and the General Jackson's chicken is extremely spicy. All the sides were amazing, except the fries, which were just fries and so get the awesome stuff instead! The food is more New Orleans, than Southwest Louisiana (what I'm more familiar with).  The actual restaurant is very small, and not really family friendly. There is no high chair, and no large tables. Its unassuming and in a small strip mall, but a good place to take a date, or meet a friend for dinner. If you have more than 2-3 people, then order the take out!"}
{"text":"This place is super legit.    Came here a while back with a friend.  They have really strange hours so it took us a little while to figure out when they were open for us to try.  So glad we made it! We were the only ones there for lunch on a Saturday.  It's a hole-in-the-wall local place, with some amazing Cajun food. The place screams New Orleans and has a really cool laid back vibe. The waiter was super helpful in helping us pick out what to eat.  We got the New Orleans style shrimp on jambalaya and crawfish etouffee to share.  It was plenty of food! And sooooo tastyyyyyy. Warning it's pretty spicy.  The service was quite slow (I mentioned we were the only customers there...) but it was worth it.  Don't come here if you're in a rush. It is also a little bit pricey so not somewhere I'll go often, but it's all seafood and worth the price if you're in the mood for cajun food.  I went to NOLA shortly after and this place definitely matches the caliber there.   Definite place you need to check out! For something more chill, would be a good date spot!"}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of 5 stars, but this is the real deal.  Straight out of Nawlins, Junior Battiste is careful that every visitor gets a taste of both authentic Cajun cuisine and the hospitality of the culture.  What a guy.  This is real étouffée, real gumbo, real jambalaya.  You'll know the difference in first bite.  Ask him one too many questions and he'll be sure to explain the difference between light and dark roux, give you samples to taste, and talk about his favorite flavors.  He just loves food. Period.  The quaintness of the place just sets it off. It's awkward. It's cramped. But that's why you'll be back.  Because instead of feeling like a cafeteria it feels like a dimly lit living room with smells wafting from the adjacent kitchen.  For you New Yorkers - you know this setting is special.  He best Cajun outside of N.O.  Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Wish I could do a review in pictures but I can't. Nonetheless, I have uploaded before and after pictures to illustrate the scrumptiousness of the food.  Battiste and Dupree will be a 'Nay!' for you if:  1) You are in a hurry. By 'hurry' I mean you allocated an hour for dinner.  2) You are feeling averse to friendly banter with Junior Battiste or the regular(s) sitting at the bar.  3) You are looking for a four page drinks menu - they have bud and Abita brews and four or five mixed drinks.  4) You want upscale decor - this is a hole in the wall.   Battiste and Dupree will be a 'Yay!' for you if:  1) You appreciate and applaud the spirit of independent restaurateurs committed to serving good food. Scratch 'good food' and make it 'GREAT food'.  2) If you enjoy a 'neighborhood hang out' kind of atmosphere where regulars wave hellos and goodbyes to you (no doubt put in good humor because of the delicious food they have consumed or are about to consume) and the chef (who is also server and bar keep) asks your friend if he would be a gentleman and grab the beers your group wants from the cooler!   3) You are not in a hurry - Junior Battiste IS the chef, server and bar keeper and everything tastes like it is made from scratch...which it probably is. After my friend got an offended look for asking 'What's good?' (What do you mean what's good? EVERYTHING is good!), I did not dare ask if my etouffee was made from scratch.  4) You love cajun food.   The crawfish etouffee was delicious. It is a little on the spicier side - I stole pieces of french bread from my friend to soak the sauce up. The shrimp po boy was layers of flavor and huge. Cajun bbq shrimp disappeared alarmingly quickly. Husband had to defend his deluxe platter from the marauding horde at the table - polish boy (succulent), fried catfish (with breading that is light, non greasy, crisp and magically adheres to every bit of the fish aka no gross, oily, soggy, thick breading that falls off the fish in clumps here), wings and fries.  Go here. Be prepared to wait for your dinner, enjoy an Abita brew and conversation with Junior Battiste and other customers while you wait, leave with the warm glow that only an evening spent with friends/family enjoying good food and drink can provide."}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans and just moved to Cleveland,it was recommended to my husband and myself to try this restaurant since we are from there. I was never so disappointed by the food!!! This is not Louisiana cooking. The red beans was nothing more than kidney beans in water, the gumbo is not gumbo and the spicy dish was just hot sauce over something related to chicken. Never again.  Do not go."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.  The restaurant is small but has a lot of characters.  The owner told us he never precook anything so everything there is cooked fresh and may take a little longer.  But it was totally worth it.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Hearing many good things about the chef here so I had to try them out. I'm not aware of any Cajun restaurants in the area so I was excited to get a chance to taste. I got in on a group takeout order with friends from work and it was highly suggested that I try their wings.  I ordered the fun box which includes a po' boy, wings and fries. The po' boy was legit with a soft roll, spicy sausage, crunchy coleslaw and fries on top.  Yep, I would eat one of these again.  The fries are are something fun.  They are more of a steak fry with a spice seasoning sprinkled on them.  The real star were the wings.  Crispy on the outside, maybe lightly floured, with a light slathering of  subtle sweet and spice sauce.  Nothing overwhelming but as I started to eat a couple of these, the spice builds up.  Really one of the best wings I've had in the area.  From what I have sampled from their menu, I am very impressed with the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant actually at the Taste of Cleveland, where I tried some delicious gumbo at their booth.  There's a good reason why they keep on winning each year for best entree at the Taste of Cleveland festival.  After eating at this restaurant tonight, I can honestly say that I've had  The best jambalaya I've ever tasted The best red beans and rice I've ever tasted Quite possibly the best fried catfish I've ever tasted ... You get the point, right?  Even the bread served with the jambalaya was delicious.  2 thick slices of French bread, grilled with butter and soaked with honey on both sides.  Oh, and the salad that came with the jambalaya- so good!  It was a giant salad filled with that type of \"Spring mix\" salad, with strawberries, carrots, cucumber, raisins, apples, and toasted pecans.  The fruits were arranged in a decorative pattern on the salad, and it came with a spicy herb vinaigrette.  Service is a little slow, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Quite an impressive fried catfish platter.  I had a craving for some Southern food, so I went to try Battiste & Dupree.  The fried catfish platter came with two sides - I chose the red beans and rice and the Creole potato salad.  The fried catfish was perfectly breaded and fried.  The sauce, which is similar to a Creole tartar sauce, also tasted very good.  Only thing I would change is to have less salt in the breading.  The rice and beans had decent flavor and was just a little bit spicy.  I liked how the Creole potato salad had Granny Smith apples in it.  The potato salad overall was sweet and not too creamy.  This place is a small restaurant in a strip mall, so there isn't a huge dining area.  There is a large bar, though, to sit at.  The dishes are moderately priced. (my entree was $15)."}
{"text":"Every time I walk through the doors I feel like I am stepping back onto the streets of NOLA. The food and the atmosphere are authentic and that is the best compliment I gave give Junior and his place."}
{"text":"This food is delicious!!!!! It feeds your belly and your soul. The best wings I have ever had and the friendliest staff :] I ate my first Po Boy here too. Amazing. This is a must go to spot. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the Wall (good thing) with food as good as New Orleans.  Cannot go wrong...go visit Junior."}
{"text":"A foodie should definitely make a pilgrimage to this Battiste. Fantastic food, weird decor."}
{"text":"Food is good, but this is a really small restaurant with maybe 5 tables. I made a reservation at 7:30pm on a Friday night, and my plate came around 8:45pm."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there for a casual dinner. This place was very hard to find first of all - there was no sign or anything whatsoever, so it took us a while to find this place. The interior decor was quite interesting but they don't have that many tables. We ordered family style fried chicken wings, seafood platter and crawfish entufee. I have to say everything was very salty but they fried the food very well. I also liked the crawfish entufee. The jambalaya rice was very spicy. If I have to pick one that I liked the best, it's the crawfish entufee. I wish it had more crawfish and less rice in the dish for the amount I pay for the dish. Overall, I think this place is overpriced. We paid about $20 per person and some of us were not even full afterwards."}
{"text":"Junior is the Man! He's from New Orleans and makes the best gumbo I've ever had. He treats everyone like a friend and guest in his house. An incredible man with incredible food and stories. A true hidden gem on the east side if you like that authentic New Orleans feel and food. Whether you  just wanna drink from a guy that makes you feel like family or the food that he creates, Junior is a special guy with special talents. He brings the south to NE Ohio, no doubt!"}
{"text":"I lived in New Orleans for four years before moving to Cleveland...I have eaten in a couple of the Cajun/creole restaurants in the city and nothing comes close to batiste and Dupree I feel like I'm home in New Orleans everytime I eat here...best Cajun food in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Well let me start this off by saying I am from South West Louisiana, and have a HUGE Cajun family.  I have spent much of my life eating and visit New Orleans, and most of the creole and Cajun areas of the south.  This was by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had eating.  It took hour upon hours to get food, no one at the table got food at the same time either.  The gumbo was VERY thin and watery with ONE and I mean ONE shrimp in it, the crawfish had zero seasoning on them no corn and HUGE russet potatoes that were not cooked, the red beans and rice were not cooked, in fact the beans were still basicially hard and raw.  I asked for hot sauce and they asked was it not spicy enough for me???  Well no it was not considering there was NO spice in anything at all. There is one person running the place and cooking and he is not very nice.  The restaurant is extremely dirty and I an not sure how it has not been shut down by health inspectors. In the time it took to get our food I could have driven to Louisiana, eaten there and drove back to Ohio.  I am not sure who wrote the other reviews but I will assume they are from the people who work there..."}
{"text":"Only crawfish boil in Cleveland and boy, was it good!  Fresh, spicy, potatoes cooked to perfection!  I was munching on the corn even the next day and counting down the days to the next boil!  The owner is as fun as can be and will tell you everything you want or need to know about his food and goes out of his way to offer suggestions and cook you whatever you want.    The drinks are PERFECT.  Only regret is they dont have soda water, so I had a lot of fruit juice that day.  Also, anyone who mentioned that it is in a bad neighborhood, it's 100 yards from WholeFoods.  Get a grip.  Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 2 times. One word \"Overpriced\" I ordered a $15 catfish dinner for take-out and instead of expecting catfish fillets or some sort, we got 3 tiny undercooked catfish nuggets and it had only 3 steak fries. Also, the owner is patronizing to his cook, I would never criticize my employees or belittle them in front of customers, the owner also has weird comments from time to time, which is a bit uneccessary. The owner needs to invest in customer service, lower the prices on food, and maybe hire one more person at least part-time to assist with his operation."}
{"text":"This little place off Cedar is such a gem! I was ravenous, and just happens to be in the area and found this place on yelp. I walked in, expecting ok food but came out wishing I lived closer so I could have their food more often!!  I ordered the deluxe seafood poboy. And it was humongous. The seafood was battered in a strong batter and deep fried - just the way I like it, and sandwiched between some really tasty sauces, onion, tomatoes and lettuce. The bread was also really delicious. The sandwich is probably as big as both of my feet put together. Trust me, it's large. I don't usually finish large sandwiches, but I finished 80% of my sandwich.   The crispy and well seasoned seafood and chicken inside the sandwich, fresh toppings, good sauce, and fresh bread really made the sandwich super special. The side fries it came with had cajun salt over it. I don't care if you're a big man. This sandwich will fill you up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the homemade, fresh delicious choices we made ! The owner made us feel like family! We ordered the  shrimp, zucchini and okra and  barbecue  Cajun wings for appetizer! It was plentiful, hot and extremely tasty! For our main course the chicken and French toast was the favorite!  The gumbo was filled with all kinds of seafood but I was underwhelmed. The polish poboy was excellent! The coleslaw was fabulous! The rum cake and pralines which were complimentary were off the hook!!! I almost forgot the dirty rice egg rolls were different yet out of this world!!! I definitely would recommend this fine eating establishment!  Junior Batiste was an excellent host to our party!!!"}
{"text":"Food rocks. Drove by and decided to stop and get food.  Great prices and awesome sea food.  Thanks junior"}
