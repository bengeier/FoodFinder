{"text":"I ordered their Lamb Shawarma and crab cake bites appetizers last night. I woke up promptly at 5:30 this morning and proceeded to puke my guts out. I'm not sure which did the job, but they were the only things I had eaten that day. That being said the meal itself was pretty mediocre.   There are many other places like this in the Pittsburgh area, I'm sure you can find a better one."}
{"text":"FOOD NOT AS DESCRIBED.  Delivery came very quickly, within 30 minutes, but the food is nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Garden Salad with cheese, which came with NO CHEESE, EVEN THOUGH I PAID EXTRA FOR IT, no feta as listed in the description, NO GREEN PEPPERS, AND NO OLIVES...all ingredients that were supposed to come on the salad.  Basically, I got lettuce with tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Definitely not worth the money.  My boyfriend got the chicken kabob, which came with only 6 tiny pieces of chopped up chicken on a HUGE bed of rice with little to no flavor.  Also not worth the $8.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars.  Since I live nearby I get the full impact of the douchebags who work here. Every single day - EVERY SINGLE DAY - I have to deal with the employees/friends of employees who sit outside and harass women that are minding their own business. While I've made it very clear their commentary is unwanted it's persisted for practically the entire year I've lived nearby.  A few months after I first moved in I checked it out for the first time. One of the employees asked really probing questions about me, knowing that my parents had visited and where I worked. While the food was decent it did nothing to get the horrible taste of the experience out of my mouth.   When I wait for the bus nearby the same guy will take smoke breaks and just stare. It's the creepiest shit in the world.  I don't want any other women to deal with this obvious and disgusting harassment. I plan on filing charges and hope others who've experienced their bullshit will do the same."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shawarma and garlic naan.  What I got was Italian-seasoned chicken and vegetables wrapped in a pizza crust and more pizza crust dipped in garlic from a jar.  The chicken stuff was at least edible; the \"naan\" was definitely not.  0/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Small place on Centre that just opened up, staff is extremely nice and courteous.  Delicious chicken kabobs and proper hookah's - reasonably priced.   Perhaps student discounts would attract more ppl in the future too."}
{"text":"Food was OK, a little overpriced for its size and quality (small/mediocre respectively). My experience was tainted also in part because yelp had led me to believe that this would be a hookah lounge, and that simply is not the case. As of at least 2/17/11, Shiraz definitely does not serve hookah, and after speaking with a guy behind the counter, it doesn't seem that they have any intention of serving it again in the future. A little unfortunate, because unlike the Hkan, Sphinx, and Hookah Bookah, you could actually get hookah here before 4/5pm. With that gone, I won't be going back anytime in the near future, as the food and atmosphere aren't enough to justify the trip.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. The buffalo chicken sandwich and pizzas are pretty fool proof. The have a King Kong pizza that literally can't fit through a door, but it's great for parties because it feeds a lot of people and is pretty cheap! Their buffalo chicken and bbq pizzas are delicious if you are looking for something new a little different. The only downfall is how long it takes to get your food. The estimated time is usually not correct, so I wouldn't go here if you're really in a hurry to get somewhere. But if you've got a second and a craving for pizza, try it out!"}
{"text":"I know people hate this place, and I have to start by saying I don't eat meat. So, I don't know about the kabob, and it does seem a little expensive to me, but I wouldn't really know. That being said, they have lots of other food that's not bad. I've had sandwiches and stuff here (veg of course) that were pretty good, and not as expensive as the kabob. They also have pizza joint food (albeit under another name the address/phone number is the same). The pizza is killer, and super fast delivery even in the snow."}
{"text":"I trust Yelp for a reason. I stay away from places that have 2.5 stars. But the boyfriend made me go!   I expected it to be bad but not this bad!!!! Have you tried the amazing Halal carts in NY with delicious flavored rice topped with juicy lamb and chicken? Oh and the intoxicating white sauce ... only $6 for TWICE as much food as Shiraz. How could you serve me this god-awful mess for ... wait for it ... $12? Are you for serious? $12 is standard for excellent persian grilled meats, not terrible ones.  Bland chicken, dry beef, plain white rice, some watery white sauce. Never again. TRUST YELP."}
{"text":"Ok now I've been waiting to make my 1st Yelp review and hopefully on a GREAT restaurant... This is not the case.  Now there's not to many Mediterranean food places open around 9 pm or at least not 1 I want to drive to so I took a chance on this place, reviews weren't the best but how bad can it be right? Here's my experience.. I look online at their menu I find something I like \"now maybe there was a mis understanding but idk\" I thought I was getting the 8.99 sirloin kabob meal with grape leaves and a drink I look it up it's around 16.00 and that's how much they said it would be cool. The food gets here I'm happy ready to eat and I only have kabob and my soda :/ not to happy, I call they said I ordered a different meal \"like I said may have been a misunderstanding\" but still $16 for what I got was not worth it.. I go up there no help and I'm left with this meal it's the Sultani Kabob \"check the picture\". Now I left came back and looked at it and ate it for 1. Some of the meat wasn't cooked all the way I pretty much gave it to my dog \"check the picture\" 2. Right after I ate my stomach starts to hurt \"not good\" and 3. Yet again this meal was not worth the price! I like to give places the benefit of the doubt but truthfully this was not a good meal I honestly would not recommend this place to anybody and last for most LUCKY TOOTIES HOT ITALIAN BEEF WAS STILL OPEN FOR THE WIN!!!  From yours truly the Voice of the Streets and Grade A food Yelper Mike"}
{"text":"Looking at the menu I would hardly call this place a \"Persian\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Very delicious Koobideh kabob! Koobideh pizza is also very nice! I go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Maybe I have lower take-out standards than some in the Yelp community or something, but Shiraz is a-ok with me. Their delivery is speedy, the order is always correct, and the food is always warm.  I do like their pizza shop items better, particularly the calzones, but I've had a kebab dish and the flavors were good with perfectly cooked rice - it was just a little too expensive for what it was. The gyros weren't good and I wouldn't order that again.  I really like the fries with some mozzarella cheese on top. They seem to actually be fresh cut and they don't skimp on the cheese. I believe it comes in the aluminum container that they cook them in, so the temperature is on point even after a delivery trip. I've gotten the calzone a few times (really like the seafood one) and they are big! I've been able to make 2-3 meals out of it each time, though my hubby can eat the whole thing in one sitting so guess it depends how hungry you are!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  If you must know why, read on.  I had wanted to try this place for a while as I pass by it on Centre Ave. all the time.  Why I chose to try this place on an empty stomach, of all days, I will regret forever.  The place had poor service, was overpriced, had such small servings and just bad food in general.  I got the Chicken Tandoori and my boyfriend got something with beef in it (I forgot what it was called).   We initially wanted our food to-go but changed our minds.  When my boyfriend approached one of the people behind the counter (I am assuming he was a delivery guy), he gave my boyfriend an attitude as if he should've known to tell someone else as he seemed to be taking orders on the phone.  We were the ONLY ones at the restaurant and our food took 20 minutes to be served.  The Chicken Tandoori I got was so spicy, it was painful to eat.  I have to admit, it might have been my mistake, ordering something that maybe I should have known was spicy.  However, the menu did not say the dish was spicy nor did the servers ask how spicy I wanted my food to be.  My boyfriend got a beef dish that was tough and hard to eat.  As if they needed to emphasize how small the meat portions were, my chicken and his beef were served over a huge portion of white rice.  Our measly meal was almost $20 and we walked away completely unsatisfied, never wanting to return again.  It was my horrible mistake to forget to check Yelp first before even trying this place.  What a waste of my money!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon around 1:30 pm.  The place was completely empty and yet it still took 20 minutes to get the lunch special chicken shawrma.    Food: mediocre Service: terrible Decor & atmosphere: miserable  Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"tl;dr Inedible. Avoid at all costs. Zero stars.  The only thing authentically Middle Eastern about this place is the fact that their meat approximates the texture and appearance of ancient Egyptian mummies.  I ordered takeout from this establishment. A few simple meat over rice dishes. Chicken kabob, gyro, beef kebab. What they served barely registered as food. The gyro meat was like modeling clay left in the sun, and crunched when I tried to bite it. The beef had progressed past the jerky phase and into some uncharted territory of inedibility. The chicken was translucent and smelly, like...well, like chicken that has gone bad. It defies metaphor. The rice was...present...in its gloppy over-cooked glory. This was served with a plastic cup of ranch dressing and a plastic cup of the saddest little half-rotten, feculent excuse for a cucumber salad.  I called this establishment (I hesitate to call it a restaurant. That title is earned) to complain, and was met with a very unapologetic response. Allow me to directly quote: \"yeah, we were running low on meat today so yours was from much earlier in the day.\"  Five stars to Wheel Deliver for getting us a full refund for this inedible insult to human decency."}
{"text":"I am a frequent delivery orderer. Whenever I order from this restaurant, an old somewhat physically inable man brings the food to the door which takes FOREVER. Watching him moving slowly in front of my eyes is just painful. I've ran to his car a few times.   The purpose of the delivery is to receive my food AT THE (front) DOOR. Not to run out of my apartment building to get food; I would rather go pick it up for myself.  Their food doesn't worth paying the same percentage of tip to the driver as for waiter service at the restaurant, and to run out to their car to get my food."}
