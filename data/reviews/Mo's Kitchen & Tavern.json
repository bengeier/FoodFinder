{"text":"Don't go here! Horrible experience for me anyways. 45 min wait for uncooked fish and chips. Greek salad absolutely drenched in dressing. Cheap and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick, hearty and best of all cheap meal amidst some of the fancier options in Downtown Oakville? Search no-Mo. That's right. Mo's is your best spot. 

A second location following the popular original Oakville greasy spoon, this shiny new version is deceptively huge with tons of seating and a menu of equally sized big meals. 

Stopped in today and on the recommendation of my DC went with one of their wraps. The buffalo chicken wrap to be exact. It came with the option of standard sides (fries, soup or salad) and I was all set to go with the salad but our server (who shared a striking resemblance to Mena Suvari) really encouraged us to try the vegetable soup of the day (which was like a thai fusion vegetable soup on account of the coconut milk). Ok sure. 

Soups took a few minutes longer tha. I'd expect soup to take but once it arrives it lived up to the hype. A creamy almost thai curry taste to a standard veggie soup. Awesome. I'd barely had 2 bites before two insane sized wraps showed up at the table. Packed with tons of chicken and ingredients and some grill marks along the outside. 

As far as wraps go, it was a great value at $8.50 for the soup and wrap as a combo. Plus it was packed with ingredients and was tasty. As far as \"buffalo chicken\" it was no where close. The signature flavors of buffalo chicken are; a cayenne pepper butter sauce, dill dressing and blue cheese. This was a sticky sweet BBQ chicken wrap. Come on guys. Don't kid a kidder, you don't get to 900 reviews without knowing the difference between BBQ and butter sauce. 

That said, it was still a good wrap, just not what I expected. A good hearty lunch that filled us up and didn't break out wallets! I'm always a fan of good value.

{"text":"Came here after a relaxing salt cave experience down the street. Only stumbled here because we were on a time limit with parking and it was the only restaurant that wasn't busy. Was looking forward to a scrumptious lunch but it turned out to be below average justifying the low reviews. We were seated and greeted right away as the restaurant wasn't very busy.

After receiving our glasses of water, I immediately noticed that my glass was cracked with water seeping. My fork was also dirty making me wonder do they even take care of their plates and cutlery. 

Now onto the food, I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and kale salad on the side. Man, the sandwich was something I could have made at home even better. It had no dressing but mayo on the side, grilled chicken was dry and lacked flavour. It wasn't very appetizing as the sandwich fell apart so I only took bites of the chicken with some old lettuce. The kale salad was probably the only decent part of the meal, it had an interesting apricot dressing. Overall, the experience wasn't very pleasant and service was just average."}
{"text":"Fabulous food
Fabulous staff
Huge portions
Great price

I can't fathom how this place has 2.5 stars, it's amazing! Nice decor and atmosphere, delicious food, friendly staff. I've never once had a bad experience here. 10/10"}
{"text":"Was doing some banking in the area and asked the bank staff if they knew of some place reasonable and good to have brunch.  Two employees and a fellow customer all said \"Mo's.\"  They told as where to go and off we went

My daughter had the Salmon Omelette which she loved. My Eggs Benedict was delicious. Good came fast. The service couldn't have been nicer and the portions were large!  Enough for two meals. Price? Very reasonable 

The decor is dated and overall it needs the once over but it was clean and friendly

Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on the notion that this place would be good (based on the reviews of the place) but boy was I in for a disappointing meal. I went here for lunch/dinner with my mother on a weekday evening, and not too surprisingly the place wasn't busy at all; we're the only table at the time. This can be partially because we went at a fairly odd time to eat. While the service wasn't bad, I wish I could say the same for the food which I found to be quite bad unfortunately. I had the hamburger which tasted exactly like those frozen burgers you can buy from the grocery store (probably because it was frozen and from a grocery store) and my mother had the Bah Mi Hang which tasted exactly like they used a prepared sauce from the grocery store; one again, probably because it was. Even though this place is \"cheap\" I would perhaps not be parsimonious and open my wallet a little wider and go somewhere better."}
{"text":"Just ok.

Took 20 minutes to get water and a milk shake.  Straw in the shake was to short, which made for a laugh with my daughter.  Fish and Chips had an unexpected pickle on the slaw.  Overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bite to eat after a spa visit at a nearby spa. Give the time restraints of the parking meter, my sisters and I chose this place due to location and type of food. We were looking for something with salad and sandwich options which this place had. At first arrival, the place looked good with simple small town diner decor. We were seated promptly where our server seemed a bit bombarded with a lot of tables. She gave us the menus and ask what drinks we would like. Shortly after that we were able to order our food which agreeable the prices were more than fair. Our food arrived and the portion sizes were massive. I ordered the spicy buffalo chicken wrap where one half was the size of an expected wrap size. I ordered a Greek salad that was also massive. A few things to address was the cutlery wasn't clean and the flavours were average. We were able to get our bill within reasonable time and the overall experience was worth it given the prices to portion was what stood out as a plus."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with the quality of their all day breakfast. The waffle that I ordered was hard, as if it was sitting there for too long. The steak was ok by nothing to come out for. I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"We can't say whether the food was good or not because we waited for 45 minutes and the food never came so we walked out. We ordered two omelettes and our waitress never came to check on us or let us know when we could expect our meal. First and last time visiting Moe's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an off shoot of Mo's Family Restaurant on Speers, and they SHOULD be doing well enough to open a second one, because Mo's food is DELICIOUS and inexpensive. Mo's Family is one of my favorite restaurants in Oakville, and Mo's Kitchen and Tavern doesn't drop the ball. The menu at this restaurant is a bit different and a lot shorter, but the food is just as delicious and just as plentiful. I recommend the Bah Mi Hang, which is a thai dish and WOW, it's SO GOOD. My Husband craves it now! 

The waitresses are so kind - Kim once brought me a piece of cake with a birthday candle in it for my birthday, and new addition Sarah is super friendly and makes your visit special. Overall, a fantastic addition to the Mo's name!"}
