{"text":"It is my favorite spot for lunch with my co-workers. With their new wide expansion, they opened in several new locations. Hence, you do not need to drive far to find one.  At first, i love and really love their decor. The metallic yellow with the black and white mood and feel, modern design, eclectic style, fresh atmosphere make this pizzeria a great destination for an enjoyable lunch.   The service is always fast.  They even offer delivery is some of their locations.  Their menu is small, wich give the  opportunity to try all their pizza. Every time I try one. I am always happy with their crunchy authentic pizza , not very big. It is perfect for lunch.  They have the sweet ones with fig, they also have the salty ones with salami.  All their pizzas come with arugula salad or Cesar salad.   Lately, I've been going for the Calzone. The melting mozzarella with the italian sausage is mouth watering. Pair it with a good red wine and you will defenetly spend a great time at one of the fastest growing pizza place in montreal."}
{"text":"Enfin une bonne pizzeria dans le sud-ouest. C'était ma première expérience dans cette chaine de resto, et j'avoue que mes préjuges se sont rapidement volatilisés. La pâte est à la fois élastique, croustillante et savoureuse. Les choix des garnitures nous permettent de personnaliser délicieusement cette tarte italienne.  Et ce qui ne gâche pas l'expérience, on y trouve un bon rapport qualité/prix. Un seul bémol, bien que le choix musicale était intéressant, la qualité des \"enceintes acoustiques\" est horrible, une exposition prolongée pourrait faire saigner vos oreilles..."}
{"text":"Bel endroit. Service courtois.  Siège pour enfant disponible.  Bonne pizza mais pas exceptionnelle."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time this week, supposedly the best in town. We got a table right away which was great. Great pizzas, very tasty, with fresh ingredients. I definitely recommend adding a buffala on top of the margherita as it would be pretty dry otherwise. You get to see your pizza being made, and the smell of the pizza oven will definitely make you hungry! They come out pretty warm but will get cold rather quickly... eat up!  I recommend one per person for a meal; and sharing a desert.  The food quality is excellent for the price, and service is pretty quick.  Wine options are good, decently priced as well."}
