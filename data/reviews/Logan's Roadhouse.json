{"text":"I expect more from a chain restaurant. The hostess was chomping gum and seemed annoyed that she had to stop texting when she had to seat us. About an hour before close the servers were sweeping up the peanuts and moving tables. We all felt rushed. It didn't help that the beer was warm. Problem from restocking and not rotating. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The salad was excellent. Not just some tossed lettuce. Steak & shrimp too was exceptional The free peanuts weren't bad either. Dieting, so no dessert."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. I have been going to Logan's for many years now and have always found it enjoyable. Tonight, however, is a different story. The service from our waiter, Kyle was horrendous. It took him a while to even greet us and take our drink orders. He came back to take our meal orders, and I was still deciding, so I asked him to come back in 2 minutes; he came back in 10. That should've been the first sign that the service was going to be bad. He finally brought us our bread, but still not the drink I had ordered. By the time he brought my drink, we were already ready for a second helping of bread. We overheard the table in front of us asking him what was taking so long with their food, and he did not apologize and blamed the kitchen. When we got our food, it was brought out to us by someone else, and when he saw, he hurried over. He asked me if my steak was the right temperature, and wanted me to cut into it to check. By this time, I was no longer hungry, and wasn't going to eat it anyways, so I declined checking. Of course when he walked away, it made sense that he asked about the temperature of the steak, rather than if it was cooked to my liking, because the steak was cold to the touch. I then proceeded to touch everything else on our plates, and all of our food was cold, except for my potato, which had kept itself warm from the oven. At this point, I was done. I asked our waiter for our check and two boxes, because neither of us wanted to eat our cold food. The two tables to our right had a waiter named Howard, who came to check on then every five minutes or so. The gentlemen sitting at those tables came in well after we did, and got their food, hot and fresh, well before we did. On one of Howard's many rounds, I asked him to grab the manager for us. She showed up a few minutes later, and when we explained everything, she proceeded to also blame the kitchen staff. I pointed out that our food was cold to the touch and was not brought out to us by our waiter. She apologized, and said the food was on her, but we would have to pay for the alcoholic drink we had ordered. Instead of taking the check and card in front of her to close us out and get us on our way, she walked away. Our waiter came back to the other tables numerous times, but also didn't bother to grab our check. After waiting another excruciatingly painful, long amount of time, we decided to leave $10 on the table and walk out."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star I used to come here a lot and they have let there self go tremendously. It took 5 mins to get seated with the hostesses stuffing there face before seating us then couldn't find our waiter. Went to the bathroom it looked horrible like it hasn't been touched all day and they weren't busy at all. I was not impressed at all with this place last time ill ever eat there."}
{"text":"Came in with a family of 6, including one newborn, one 2 year old, two teenage girls, and us. They initially tried to sit us at a table for 4. We took one look and knew 6 of us wouldn't fit and asked for a slightly bigger table. They put us at a table for 6 in an unoccupied corner of the restaurant. After 15 minutes of eating peanuts and not getting a waiter, or water, or anything for that matter, we walked out. We've been here before with okay service. Don't think we will be back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"Wow! what a disappointment. We were treated to the hostess's butt; she never did turn around. Then it took forever for our server to get to us. The food was good but when we told our server that one of our shrimp was chicken, she laughed and didn't do anything about it. The rest of the service was very very slow and half way through our meal our server said she was going on break and we had to cash out. When we said oh well no more drinks or dessert, she said she could ring in our drinks, give us upside down shot glasses and we could flag someone down when we were ready and she could get us our dessert now! Woo hoo! The manager came over to take our money and when we asked her how short staffed was she, she said she wasn't and walked away. She sent someone else  over with our change so she wouldn't have to talk to us again. No wonder this place has lousy reviews."}
{"text":"By far, the WORST STEAKHOUSE in the Phoenix area. Way over priced for the quality of meat you get. My wife and I were here Monday night cause we thought we should try all the restaurant at Nortera. We got the 16oz Ribeye with Ribs. The ribs were mediocre (Chili's is 3x better), but the Steak is awful. We ordered a Medium, yet blood was dripping out of the meat when we cut it...But that's not the bad part, the Steak was TOUGH, bland and .can definitely taste the freezer burn. I am almost certain that the steak was not Ribeye, worst, it may not even be a Cow. Or if it is, it may be a Chuck Steak disguised as Ribeye straight from the freezer to the grill...So to make it worth my while, I decided to ask for some Crumbled Bleu Cheese to put a little taste on the Steak, and the waiter brought me about 2 oz and charged me $2 for it. That's not the end of it, because the Steak was so tough, I was almost choked on it, and our very attentive waiter was taking his time to bring me a refill for my drink, while he chitchatted with his visiting friend behind our booth....Lucky for the owner of this place, I'm the type who doesn't complain, and would still tip the waiter, but will tell the whole world about my experience...My suggestion if you want to try this place, don't have a higher expectatiion than eating at Dennys but expect to pay 4 times more....and have a very strong teeth to bite in their medium rare bland so called Ribeye Steak...."}
{"text":"I've been to this location quite a few times. When I am in the mood, I love their food. I recommend the roadies. They are sliders served on the rolls they serve at the beginning of the meal. Yummmmm. Last time I was there, we also ordered the appetizer combo. That was fabulous as well.   The service isn't memorable, never great but never bad either. The keep your drinks full and bring your food quickly but nothing exceptional.   So far I have received decent service and delicious food. If you'd in the mood for roadhouse type food, make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Went to have dinner with some friends before movie I ordered the brewski stake my buddy ordered 22 ounce steak and my other friend order the shrimp everything was delicious service was outstanding we were seated in Sarah's section always on top of everything our glasses were never empty. she was always making sure we had the best enjoyable time there and it's very hard to find service like that so thank you Sarah for outstanding service we will be back.  Sincerely Moe Ramirez"}
{"text":"Good lord. Do people not want to work anymore. 6 girls standing around hostess stand while customers what 46 min for a seat because the kitchen is backed up. Get rolls. Get drinks. Bus tables. Do something. I'm afraid this place won't be open much longer."}
{"text":"We were very happy with this place. The food was good and so were the prices. Our whole party could easily see the tv's for Monday night football. There were free peanuts and the music wasn't too loud. The entire staff was friendly and our waiter Alex was great. My picky eater daughter loved the country style chicken & mashed potatoes with white gravy. Overall this is a great place."}
{"text":"Came in a few days ago to grab a quick dinner after work as I didn't feel like cooking. I ordered a medium rare 12oz ribeye with asparagus, fries and shrimp skewers. The bartender was very attentive, she took my drink order and returned with my iced tea, sugars, and a basket of bread with butter. My meal came out promptly as expected and was cooked perfectly. The asparagus was great as were the shrimp skewers. The fries however did not come out with the meal, but that's not a big deal to me. I finished every bit of the meal as it was delicious and I was quite hungry. The bartender noticed my tea was getting low and she refilled the glass without me having to ask, good service. After my plate was empty she came to collect it and asked me how it was. I told her it was great but the fries did not come out. She immediately apologized and I told her it's not a big deal but she insisted on making it right. She asked if I would still like the fries to be brought out and I told her no, there's no way I could eat them. I did however ask for a beer which she happily brought out and covered on my  behalf. I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"My food came out ice cold. I don't mean warm, I mean cold! Other order at table was fine."}
{"text":"Came to Logan's to celebrate my sister's birthday on a Monday evening and left disappointed for several reasons.  1)  Restaurant was quiet, but yet we received the worst service.  Our waitress introduced us to a trainee and informed us that she'd be shadowing her during our visit.  First chance, our waitress left us with the trainee.  The only time the trainee, as well as the waitress, came over is when she delivered something we REQUESTED (soda refills, rolls, etc).  There was no interaction nor did we feel welcome in this establishment.  To make it worse, it didn't help to see all the employees sitting at a table talking while we were put on disregard. 2)  ordered the Chopsteak and it tasted old.  I had my husband and sister try it as well.  I informed another server about my Chopsteak since our trainee/waitress never came to check on us.  They took my plate and told me they would place another order of Chopsteak which I refused.  If it tasted bad, why give me another one?  3)  ordered a steak in replace of the Chopsteak, but never received my meal in time to enjoy it with my family.  By the time they were finished eating, my steak was still cooking.  I had to eventually ask to pack it up since there was no point of staying to eat.  Brought the steak to work the next day and soon discovered that it was cooked medium rare (requested medium well).  If it was that rare, why did it take so long for them to cook it?  4)  The receipt was brought out (no \"I'm sorry discount\") and I noticed a survey on it.  They took our receipt, but only left us with a merchant copy of the total bill after they charged our cards.  So I had to request for the receipt so I could complete the survey.  Unfortunately our experience was terrible and will never return back to this location."}
{"text":"I couldn't find the half a star or piece of star. Been here numerous times it's gradually gotten worse. Last night took the cake. The hostess seemed confused when we showed up. We where then sifted at table 52, as my wife and i discussed how to start our meal and debating on drinks I decided to take trip to the restroom. As I came back I noticed a waitress sitting at a booth with another couple in our section conversing. As I set down no drink yet not even a waitress. There's 2 more tables on our right being serviced by 2 different waitresses too. After 5 more mins we decided to leave just hoping 1 if the 5 hostess at the front would say something. It was only 5 o'clock at the time. Ridiculous experience!!!"}
{"text":"So took my daughter to dinner here last night and was very disappointed. We have been here before, but this time I decided to yelp about it.  We waited an unheard of 15 minutes to have a server come by and take our drink order. The soda's came and we order our dinner. Both of us like our steaks rare, both got potatoes and salad. An easy order for most kitchens, but not here. The salads were good. They have changed their dinner rolls. They used to use the ones that Golden Coral uses. The ones they use now are a lot harder then the old ones, and that was a very good part of the meal, nothing like a good soft roll with butter.   The steaks and potatoes came. I guess the cooks need to learn what rare means on steak. These steaks were cooked medium well, and for a steak lover, there goes the flavor of the meat. No amount of A1 can help that. Then to make matters worse, the potatoes were rock hard. I have yet to figure out how to do that if they are made fresh. I think we got the ones left over from the weekend. Don't ask to see a manager, because we were told he was outside talking to someone, so we just paid and left. What a waste of money. I think next time I will drive a little farther down the 17 and go to the new Texas Roadhouse or Outback.  I would have given this one star, but the server was really nice and kept the drinks filled through the whole meal."}
{"text":"Had the three entre combo. Roasted chicken was chewy and had red areas. Waiter said all their chicken all that. Beef brisket tough and slightly over done. Ribs OK grade of C.  Very disappointing  First time visit, last time a customer."}
{"text":"I would not normally choose a place like Logan's for dinner. However, I attended a family function there this evening and I can say that I had a thoroughly satisfying experience. The meal deal was a great price, the food was tasty, and the service was excellent. Hey, it's a chain restaurant, so don't expect duck confit with red cabbage to show up on the menu. But, a tender cut of sirloin with two sides for seven bucks a person (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) is hard to beat. If you're in the vicinity during the week, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Everything thing I've tried here is good! This isn't the place for people with peanut allergies because there's a bucket of them on the table.   The burger, appetizers, fries, and chips are great. I liked that the cheese in the cheese sticks were extra stringy. My steak could've been juicer but the portion was good. The pick 3 appetizers was good to split between two people and not too much that we couldn't finish our regular meals.   This place is clean other than the peanut shells on the floor but that's part of the look. I likes the service. Our waiter was good with refills and checked up on us at the right times. I appreciated that they have you check on your steak when they bring it to you.   I would recommend the Fried Cheese Burger and the Steak&Shrimp Combo."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and were looking for a nice place to eat my nephew suggested Logan's wow what a great choice beginning with the server Russell he was great got the order right our drinks were always full the food was awesome  the steaks were cooked to perfection the salads were great and my bacon cheeseburger was the bomb we will definitely be back to Logan's"}
{"text":"Great relaxing atmosphere. The peanut shells on the floor are a nice touch.  Really good food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I had a buffalo wing appetizer and a New York Strip. My father had the Ribeye. Both steaks were bland and extremely fatty. The New York had fat all around rather than just one side and the Ribeye felt like you were picking meat from the fat. The wings ended up being the best part of the meal. I could have had a Sirloin and not known the difference between that and the New York or Ribeye.   Manager took the appetizer off the bill. He did not fix the steaks or take them off the bill.  Will not be coming back, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Cute staff & nice steaks!! Liked that everyone was amused by my English accent!!!"}
{"text":"Take into consideration we visited on a Sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere was flat. Music is ok - every once in a while a good country song would come on but it was hit & miss. Wait staff is also hit & miss - some nice but ours wasn't very proactive in getting waters etc. Drinks are pretty good. Food selection wasn't as good as other places, but it had good flavor - each of us had sirloin steak. If anything is a plus, it wasn't busy at all so we were served quickly. I don't like to use reviews to compare to other restaurants but can't help & compare to TX Roadhouse because they are so close in style and food, but I'd have to say TR edges this one by a slight margin because their staff is more engaged and atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Awful dining experience..seated promptly, then waited awhile for waitress...when she finally came took drink orders..waited awful long time for my Bar drink...she came to check on us..never said anything about my drink. Had to remind her about it,she said bartender was busy! ( 2 -3 people at bar).  Restaurant was NOT busy, about 4 pm.  Finally ordered meal and 2 came with salads...AGAIN waited for salads...people next to us ordered after and received their salads while we were still waiting! AGAIN SHE SAID KITCHEN WAS BUSY!!!...Then she came out and said they ran out of hamburgers......my son had ordered one...she turned around and said oh ..they found one..really?   Salads finally came out and into about 3 bites..main meal came out..then 3 bites into main meal check came out. Really?  Also my husband ordered baked potato which wasn't warm enough to melt butter!  Never eat here and if you do waitress with short curly hair and glasses... Is your waitress. ..RUN OUT!"}
{"text":"Do not call yourself a restaurant with curbside when your patrons have to continually go in and get the food or find someone to help them.  My word, should I come to the kitchen and cook as well?   This place has really gone down hill over the last year."}
{"text":"We love this place.     I had family visiting from out of town and this is always on their list of places to eat at.   The bread is amazing and I've never had a bad filet there.   The service is usually fast and friendly though last night it was a little off.    If you want a great steak at reasonable prices, this is the place."}
{"text":"I wish I could pick half a star first off ..... well I just ordered two porterhouse steaks baked potatoes and a 6 oz and upon the pick up n delivery from a friend they were in fact one T-bone and one porterhouse steak and one 6oz. I'm paralyzed from being shot and in a nursing home .After calling Logan's roadhouse to propose their mistake I was promptly told by the manager that I was in fact mistaken and didn't know what I was talking about . The manager cursed at me and said I didn't know what I was talking about. I've never felt so disrespected and belittled in my life for a simple mistake.Their customer service was down right demeaning a rude . I wish I hadn't wasted my money at this establishment . Brandon your very rude and God bless u brother !"}
{"text":"Wait Time: About 10-15 minutes on a Friday night.   Service: Our server wasn't the best server, but I think it was probably cause we were an added table to her section. She seemed very busy with all the tables, so it's understandable. It took her a while to greet us, by the time she greeted us we already knew what we wanted to order, despite it being our first time there. I was a little disappointed that we got our bread and salad at the same time our entrees arrived. I'm the type of person that likes a little pause between the bread/salad and entree.   Food/Drink Quality: My boyfriend loved the complementary bread. It's covered with oil/butter and freshly warm. The food was average. We ordered the baby back ribs and it was a little dry, but the meat was easy to fall off the bone which made it very convenient. The fried chicken was ok. I expected it have more skin and be breaded.   We were surprised to be told they were out of Samuel Adams on a Friday night. That looks really bad for a restaurant. I had the strawberry lemonade instead and I must say that was my favorite food/drink for that night. Over all it was just average.   Price: It's very affordable/cheap compared to other places, but ultimately you get what you pay for. I didn't feel like it was over priced considering the quality.    Ambience: It's a little noisy. Very casual. There's a tone of peanuts on the floor, which makes it look dirty, but it's just cause everyone dumps it on the floor.  Over all, I would come back, but only because of the price and the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Brought the family for dinner, very disappointed at the wait time to be seated. It took almost 40 minutes for our meal. Took forever to bring our beverages.  Very disappointed.  Lot of staff but unable to handle the small number of customers.  No more Logan's."}
{"text":"Logan's roadhouse part two. Me, my wife, and my daughter were going to give this place another shot as before it was terrible. Afterwards we were definitely glad we have them another shot. We got seated very quickly and were given a basket of fresh delicious rolls with butter, which are way better than Texas Roadhouse rolls. For a drink, me and my wife got the blackberry lemonade (which is fantastic and I definitely recommend) and my daughter got a Sprite.  Now the food. I ordered the \"fried cheese\" & bacon burger. The bacon was crispy and cooked perfectly and the burger was cooked perfectly as well. I got the loaded baked potato as a side and it was fantastic. My wife ordered the sirloin and fried shrimp which was again, fantastic. My daughter got the chicken tenders from the kids menu which she said was good. So overall the experience we had when we went this time was great and we will definitely be back. Food:10/10 Service:10/10 Atmosphere:hasn't changed Noise level:loud music Wait time: got food/drinks quickly Overall: 10/10"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far in 2014!  Excellent food and great service.  Even my picky teenager loves this place and the menu has options for the whole family at reasonable prices.  We ordered Happy Hour sized servings of an appetizer last time and three of us didn't even finish!  And it's perfect for an afternoon lunch on weekends."}
{"text":"Okay food. Steak was really tough & didn't have much flavor. Come time to pay our bill the waitress made a mistake and closed out our table with someone else's cash. The manager on duty came over an explained the situation to us and told us and told us he was gonna have us pay 35$ took our card and didn't come back to our table for another 40 minutes. Long story short, we waited way too long to pay & that although they did offer us desert, we needed to leave. We weren't angry and I did feel bad for the girl who made the mistake but it just took waaaaaaay too long to pay and get out of there. They were very apologetic and accommodating and we appreciated that, had it not taken 40+ minutes to pay and get outta there I would've given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great for lunch when you're on a business lunch hour.  Prompt service, friendly people.  Must be good employers because the wait staff are consistent and appear to have worked there a long time.  Salads are huge and fresh.  Burgers are great."}
{"text":"We love Logans! The broccoli is always perfect, so are the grilled vegetable skewers.  The rolls are so tasty you can eat them plain! The service is very friendly. You get alot of good food for your money. Excellent selection of entrees and sides. We eat there or order to go 2 or 3 tims a month. Oh, the mashed potatoes are great...and did I mention the (out of this world) rolls???"}
{"text":"Good ribs fast service had good prices on happy hr drinks waitress was very attentive nice place free good bread and peanuts would recommend this to any family or date:-)"}
{"text":"So my husband and I frequent Logan's and the past couple of times we've been eating there we've had bad experiences. I order my steak medium rare and have had to send it back twice to get it fixed because they over cooked it. I heard the server tell another table it was his 2nd day on the floor. He never once checked to see if we needed drink refills. That is a big tip indicator for me- you let my drink get empty and I have to ask for refills, not cool. So I sat there while my husband had his steak (which was cooked perfectly) and waited for mine to be done again. The manager did come over and acknowledged the situation. We got our bill and was disappointed with the overall experience. I'm resisting complaining about not getting a discount off our meal because I don't want to sound entitled, but we were disappointed that we weren't taken care of."}
{"text":"The absolute worst steak I have ever had!!! Defiantly do NOT recommend! The food was bland and not fresh. The steak was undercooked and smelled really bad. It wasn't just my steak that was bad but also my dads steak. I am very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times. I also used to work here many years ago as a chef. I can honestly say that for the money you are going to spend you will not find better food. They have their own certified meat cutter which %90 of restaurants do not. If you don't know what this means, it is the difference between having fresh filets, ribeyes, n.y. strips, and t.bones as opposed to steaks that come in on a truck frozen. They make their own ground beef burger patties daily from ribeye.   Yes, this is a family style restaurant with peanuts on the floor and servers singing birthday songs for guests. If that's not your style then please go elsewhere instead of complaining about it here.   Yes, they get very busy at times requiring long waits to be seated and sometimes long waits for food. This is due to them being an extremely popular restaurant, quite possibly the most popular one in the concord/Kannapolis area.   Overall, this is a great restaurant and I would suggest it to anyone. Just don't go in thinking 5 star restaurant with white tablecloths because it's not that type of place."}
{"text":"Walked in, the host said it would be a wait for a 3 top, which we were fine with. Not even 30 seconds later a new group of three came in and were seated immediately. Left and never plan on returning. POOR SERVICE."}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience and so did all the people around me. You know the restaurant is poor when the manager wont even come out to talk to the tables that had a bad experience. They probably just couldn't hear another bad thing. The good:  Potato skins were awesome except the one that had nothing on it  The Bad: 1. Hostess seemed irritated that I didn't want to sit at a pub table 2. Took forever to get water-ran out of water twice 3. Waitress was clearly not in an emotional state to be at work she looked like she was coming down after a party hardy weekend. 4. Took very long time to get our salad and the food showed up right after the salad NEVER GOT BREAD AND BUTTER 5. The steak chef is not accurate I asked for medium and it was well done, chewy and dry. I basically paid $20.99 for some jerkey and a potato. 5. I needed change for a $20 waitress checks her bra for change 6. new person on shift for seating is a guy in short shorts talking on his cell phone (short shorts are not acceptable work attire for a female why is a male wearing them) 7.took over 2 hrs to be sat, get food, eat and leave. 8. MANAGER WAS \"TOO BUSY\" TO COME TO THE TABLE TO HEAR MY CONCERNS WAITRESS RETURNED WITH A DISAPPOINTINGLY DISCOUNTED BILL  \"10%\" (SO BASICALLY TAX)  BELIEVE ME THERE IS A 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20...................."}
{"text":"Steaks weren't cooked right.   I ordered a medium but got a medium-well. Son ordered medium-well, his was well-done. Steaks tasted only average. Made me question why I was eating out when I can cook a better steak on my barbeque at home.  The bread and butter served before the meal is totally delicious. Best part of the meal, easily.  The portions were small. Not a great value. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be so much better than it was.  Simply put, we went on Friday night, I ordered talipia with no season at all, of course the cook put the southwest season on it, my other half order the filet mignon with a loaded baked potato and when it came the potato only had on butter, since when is that loaded......I had to wait about 20 minutes for my fish to be cooked correctly, not ever again......so DISAPPOINTING !!!!!!!!!!  The manager didn't even care, what a waste of money ....................."}
{"text":"We have been going to Logan's for years, using \"deals\" or not. My go to favorites are the chopped steak and if i am really craving fried fish, the anticipation builds for the two large fillets that hang off the plate a bit A couple of months ago, I brought a friend for lunch and I ordered the fish and she the ground steak. When my plate was served, there was a lonely, flat, 5-6\" piece of fish.  When our waitress came by I shared my shock and she assured me that was the portion.  I looked at my friend's 10 oz steak and mentally compared cost and presentation. Our server called over the manager (on her own) and he 'assured' me that he had been there for 7 years and the portion was always the same. Tried to impress me with what type of fish was served and this was swai.  I felt  he was trying to embarrass me and i knew that Logan's used many kinds, usually catfish. Then, Manager Dorfus states he will bring me a second piece of fish free.   Arggggh When he personally delivered said free fish, he had the audacity to warn me that he wouldn't be able to do 'this service' next time. I haven't been back and that's a loss for Logan's and for me !  No one tells me what I had had multiple times to eat over this Manager Dufus'  tienure at  Logan's.    One star lost for Manager Dufus and four more,given for good food in a friendly, casual restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to visit a restaurant that cares or acknowledges you, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!!! The hostesses are more social with each other than the guests. She sat us at a dirty sticky table then when we asked for it to be wiped off she basically wipe the areas just in front of us. Oh did I mention she sprayed the table getting us as well???  No servers in sight. No manager in sight and come to think of it just a hand full of customers (that should have warned us right there!)  This place used to be busy and the service great.  I think the franchise keeps hoping it will improve.  Well, not until the staff cares more about customers than their social life.   If you're in the area, try Texas Roadhouse instead. They are on the north side of Happy Valley and the staff is MUCH nicer!  (I don't often post negative reviews but I have been burned at Logans for the last time!)"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. Wings were yummy but small. The place was nice but a bit loud."}
{"text":"Better steak than Texas Road House and better service as well. The bar tender Carly is our favorite in all of the Norterra area."}
{"text":"Have been going to this Logan's since they opened.  We stopped because of steak under or over cooked experiences. We decided to start again recently.  The quality of food seems to have improved so that's a plus.  The only issue now is that the wait staff seem to be in a hurry to get you out as quickly as possible as was the case the last couple of visits.  This latest visit our waitress became irritated when we asked if we could change our appetizer even though we told her if she couldn't it wasn't a problem.  We had just put in the order less than 2 minutes before.  She walked away abruptly without clarifying what we wanted one item changed to so when it arrived, of course, it was wrong.  Thankfully the server that brought the food over was very kind when we told her it was incorrect and took her less than a minute to bring it back with the right combination.  Can you be our waitress please?  What we were thinking.  The food was very good and our waitress did come check on us frequently which was great, however, she continued to try to remove our plates a few times when we weren't finished.  At one point, she reached for my plate even though I was eating from it as she walked up.  I do prefer to chew my food and enjoy it versus inhaling it.  Dessert?  Why even ask?  She didn't, but had she, we probably would have felt like we were insulting her since she really seemed to want us out of there fast.  Our visit before was very similar but without the rude attitude- still though seemed like they are hurrying you out the door!  Tip: if you want to relax and chew your meat, then go to the bar(have had better experience there) but if you are in a rush and want to be in and out in less than an hour, ask for a table."}
{"text":"Had dinner about 6:30pm and we had a Great experience. The service was fantastic. Very friendly. And the food was great. We ordered rib eye and shrimp and their new items, brisket, chicken and ribs. Awesome prices. So far the best steak house for the price. Give them a shot. So worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great ribs but was disappointed with the salmon. Jennifer was great and very helpful. They had ran out of bananas for the banana cream pie so they sent someone to the store for them so I can have my dessert. Well worth the wait the banana cream pie is excellent."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to have a drink and catch a basket ball game.  We have been visiting several sports bars in the area to watch games and this looks promising for the future. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Drinks were good and menu looks interesting"}
{"text":"If only giving zero stars was possible. It was our second time eating here and it was horrible. The first time eating here was fine, no trouble with the food and service but this time around they really dropped the ball. After putting in our order it took our server 30 minutes to let us know that the kitchen is backed up and our food will be delayed a little. And another 30 minutes passed by with no food in sight and no one from management has come to speak with us about the problem. The party that sat next to us arrived 15 minutes later than we did and got their food way sooner than us. Looks like they had to slaughter the cow, fish the lobster from the sea and plucked the feathers from the chicken to prepare our meal. An hour and 10 minutes later we get our food and guess what? The damn fires are stale and I didn't want to wait for my food again! We just ate our meal and asked for our check. You would think that due to their incompetence they would comp us on the appetizer that we ordered but they charged us for everything. Blame me for coming to this place and expecting decent service but I'll never make that mistake again. Take caution if/when you decide to dine in here."}
{"text":"I will never go here again..... I ordered a steak medium rare and got one completely raw.... Not even over exaggerating it was raw, the out side looked exactly the same to the middle.... We asked if they could cook just a little longer and the waitress said no problem.... She even stated it didn't look medium rare lol.... So then a gentleman brought it out like 5 mins later...... And it looked different looked better, then I cut it and after a few bites I realized it wasn't cooked over a grill it was cooked in microwave.... The outer layer way browned and hard I was so grossed out.... I paid my bill and then let her know I would never be back ever and I didn't want nothing for free.... They even left my potato on the plate when heating it up it tasted so bad..... How do you not know how to cook a steak right....."}
{"text":"Always a great place for appetizers or dinner.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  When in Gastonia this is one of my go to places to eat."}
{"text":"Worked for store 466 in Gilbert AZ They closed today. Don't ever go to Logan's 50% of the food is Frozen reheated and served. Steak is not hand cut on sight, rather poorly vacuumed packed , saying that some of the baged steak come were the seal has been damaged  and or torn which starts ageing process. And bleeds on other products at times. If you Like premade then frozen in a bag then reheated this is were to go. Thank You logans for 5 years and then pulling the rug out from all of us at store 466 with NO severance pay just a nice F\"me and good buy...  DO everyone a favor and close all 200 plus cause you will never be any better than a school cafeteria."}
{"text":"just my point exactly with me peeking in on the reviews after a [month] or so it is very apparent that Logan's does not know how to make or serve any type of food,  all the way from top of corporate to the incompetent district manager ,it seems they are very comfortable serving most of there [so called food] that has been prepared stuffed into a bag then freezing it...Waite ...oh yea . .. by the time it gets to the consumer it has been [ re-heated.]..nice  ,,,we're talking ...potatoes, brown and white gravy,apples,mac and cheese,chicken pot pie, soup, shrimp, lobsters, hamburgers, i could go on and on ,what really blows me away is the recipes for there product is the worst i have ever tasted in any kitchen I've been in , and that's 25 years experience. i guess my point is with all the bad reviews there is i am guessing 2 times more that we don't get to read for our entertainment. i curious to know who is the joker that has to  reply to unhappy customers  ?  maybe a bot because no one could say they are sorry that many times in one day for sure they would go insane. please don't eat at a Logan's before you read reviews, this is the best advice i can give to keep everyone safe. ,,,smile., ,,just a request to Logan's roadhouse.....go away no one likes you just read...or are you to busy frolicking about on how to save your asses , because it's very clear your failing. I lost count on all the bad reviews its crazy JUST READ SOME AND AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE ITS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. , plus any good reviews were mostly someone having a drink. LOGAN'S ROADHOUSE PLEASE FROZEN AND REHEATED FROM BAGGED UP FOOD. THIS IS NOT WHAT THE CUSTOMERS WANT'S THEY REALLY WANT TO GO SOME WARE ELSE AND SPEND MONEY ON REAL FOOD. I SPEAK THE TRUTH SO PLEASE DO US ALL A BIG FAVOR AND KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE....DON'T GO AWAY MAD JUST GO AWAY BANKRUPT."}
{"text":"Well we gave Logan's another try and were GREATLY Disappointed. Not busy at all and our food took forever. And when it did come my wife's salmon was BURNT and Dry. It was sent back for another 20+minute wait. I got the NEW CHICKEN POT PIE... Big mistake, it was a bowl of bad chicken soup with a big puffy pastry stuck on top. It was tasteless... beware of this one it's not good at all. The one bright spot of the night was our server at the bar Chris. Management just apologized but did nothing with our bill but charge us full price. It had been awhile since we had been there and it will be an even longer time until we go back, if ever."}
{"text":"Awesome prime rib. Great place to eat. Fun servers."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience here last night. We have had such bad service here that it has been almost a year since our last meal at Logans. I asked my fiance 'are you sure we are not going to have any issues? Outback is next door..' Then, omg! First, the waitress dropped and broke plates that hit our legs. Then my fiance asked if there wasprime rib. The waitress assured us there was. It was only 7pm. He ordered the prime rib. About 7 minutes later, the manager came back and told us there was none and recommended the rib eye. When the steaks came to the table, the manager insisted we cut them to make sure they were right. I complied. My fiance did not. It was so bizarre. Nothing was comped. There was no discount at all considering they ruined our meal. For 60, we could have gone anywhere and had a decent experience. I have drawn the conclusion that this place will NEVER improve! Avoid!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I sure would.  All based on getting seated by the kindergarteners at the hostess station looking for a marker.  The experience started with watching the couple ahead of us get seated.  We were told when the server came back that he would seat us. Didn't go as planned.  The hostess who said that proceeded to seat two different tables from people who came behind my party.  All while I'm looking at an empty clean and ready to go table five feet in front of my party.   After not getting service and watching the hostess station have three kiddos siting there looking confused my party left while I asked to see the manager.  After I watched one of the middle schoolers walk around the restaurant looking for him he finally graced me with his presence.  He said he would seat my party right now.  But I explained my party had left and I was too.  He gave appetizers in hopes I would come back to use them.   After I got home I read the card I was yet again disappointed.  There was a dollar limit on the appetizers so you had to get the cheap appetizers in addition to buying an entree at a set price.  My entree that I wanted was not that price so I would not have been able to use it.  Good going Logans you lost a repeat customer."}

{"text":"If there was less than a star I'd post. The customer. Service  was crappy it took 1 hour to get my burnt dry steak. ( with only 15 customers to the whole restaurant ) and the wings were dripping in so much grease that I couldn't make out the flavoring. My 5 year old daughters steak tips were burnt and hard as a rock they would fly to one side when trying to cut Into. My kiddos are big wing buffs so i  ordered 12 wings we all tried 1 each to make sure my taste buds weren't off . Nope they tasted like penzoil wings,  after getting a manager she didn't refund the bad food but said you had half the wing order so you will be charged for half. Just because the Manger looked like she would eat anything doesn't mean we should have to pay for bad service. As much as we enjoy eating out I would have considered returning for other items but considering their philosophy of what customer service I will never be giving them my buisness. This is the reason i support small business, it's always better."}
{"text":"We've been to Logans half a dozen times.    The Good: all you can eat peanuts, all you can eat yummy buttery soft rolls, decent service, big portions.  The Bad: overcooked steaks and burgers on several occasions, lots of fried food - bordering on TGI Friday's bar food.  The Ugly: Stop freaking asking us if it is our first time here!  Seriously - every single time they ask us this and it makes them look like nobody ever comes back.  And how many hostesses does one place need?  I swear, they had 6 hostesses at the door all exuding insincere salutations."}
{"text":"The thing you notice when you walk into the place is just how much seating area they have.  It's pretty big with even an upstairs area.  Aside from the floorplan, this is another place trying to compete with and knock off the Longhorn's of the area.  In contrast, where Longhorn's is darker inside, this place has a lighter atmosphere as the woods are lighter and the lights are brighter.   The food in comparison, while not bad, is not as good as Longhorn's, in my opinion.  I had the full rack of ribs with sweet potato and the apples.  First, let me say that the sweet potato was steaming hot and the apples were really quite delish if you like the sweet apple thing, etc.  However, the first batch of ribs my buddy and I both got were not hot and were not even warm all the way through.  The second round was better but I'm not sure why it's difficult to serve hot ribs.  Aside from their temp., they were fall-off-the-bone tender and very wet with sauce.  They were not bad but for a place supposedly known for their ribs, I have certainly had far better.  The service was friendly and adequate enough.  With a Longhorn's or even an Outback right in the area, I might eat there first next time but Logan's is certainly an option."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, good family fun. I love their health nut menu, great things to choose from and very good calorie wise.  The food tasted great, the peanuts were great and a huge hit with my little nieces and nephew....kept them entertained! Wonderful place, definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Went to this place to pick up my lunch as I work not too far away from here. The waitress wasn't at all attentive towards the customers that were trying to take the to go lunch and while I was standing there for 5 minutes she never bothered to check if I wanted something.   I have also noticed that the people who came to dine in after me were attended to immediately while I was just standing there for more than 5 minutes to see someone turn up to even place my order. It's a safe bet to say that I will never back to this place and won't recommend anyone to come here either."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Logan's I came & visit my southern family at least once a year & this is the place we go year after year!  I love the peanuts on the floor, the food, & the atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service nothing to brag about steak was dry not a real good atmosphere we went to the one at Tempe Marketplace not sure what the other ones are like but if they're anything like the one in Tempe then they probably suck just as much"}
{"text":"Liked it so much I decided on a second visit. I called in an order to go & it was royally screwed up. Ordered the onion brewski steak & end up with just a steak without any of the sauce or toppings & we didn't get the right sides we ordered. Didn't realize it until we were home so we called to see if they could do anything about it & the manager said we could get a free meal next time we went there. So the next week we called in another ordered. Same. Exact. Thing. Happened. Manager said we could get another free meal. Called in another order a few weeks later. Same thing plus they don't have one of the appetizers we wanted (but charged us anyway for something else we didn't even want) We were even promised everything in our order was correct by the hostess. Our fault for not checking I guess. So manager says he'll give us another free meal & we order again a week or so later. Finally they get it right. We made sure to check the food before we left. & the manager was nice enough to comp the entire order for our troubles.  Because they made it right, they will still have our business. & when I finally got my correct order, it was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The fresh hot rolls with butter were excellent and the caesar salad was very good. My wife ordered a filet medium and lobster tail with a loaded sweet potato and I had a sirloin medium with a lobster tail and a loaded sweet potato. It was a good thing the waitress had us cut our steaks since they were very rare. We got the steaks back and they were better but I didn't get the part of my steak I cut as a test back. Of course most of our meal was done by the time we got our steaks back. The manager when doing a walk through did apologize and did say sorry. The rest of the meal was ok and the waitstaff was adequate. If you don't want to wait for a hour at Texas Roadhouse on a Saturday night to get a table and have a craving for steak then Logan's is your next best bet."}
{"text":"They have wonderful service. I like their food. They have pricey prices but it is worth it. I love the Pina colada.     I think this is good for a nice day to relax. You should go here. It's so delicious."}
{"text":"I would NEVER go back.  I ordered a salad and twice it was delivered to the table wrong.  when asked if I would like to return it, I told them NO, I mean if you can;t get a salad right after 2 tries, what makes me think the 3rd try is going to be any different?  My wife ordered a steak done medium, it was delivered RARE.  when I asked to see a manager, the manager never showed up.  The absolute worst part.  We went because it was my Birthday and my 11yo wanted to take me there because we had never been there before and he wanted to take me someplace different.  then he felt absolutely horrible because I wasn't even able to eat."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with the family, the service was terrible.and the food worse. Took over an hour to get a kids meal, Mac & Cheese, Wings and bake potatoes. NOT TO MENTION ... my daughter's steak tips were extremely well.done and the wings were so greasy. Complained to the waiter and the Manger on site said that the will discount my kids meal, but have to pay for the greasy 4.wings. I told them I had one and each one.of the kids had another for a total of four. I asked them you prefer to lose a customer, over charging us 4.00 for 4 wings ....The Manager didn't even come over  to aplogize for the food or anything ...instead she walked by and looked away. We just paid and left and will call the Manager in the morning to complain about the service and the food. We will never go back and also they lost a company account with my husband's buisness."}
{"text":"Well the first problem I have with slogans and Monroe as a manager named Susan bitching for me that my steak but tasted like salt was merely season put on it which I don't know how that is even possible that she could know that because she never taste at the stake I was only one that taste it maybe she has some type of salt superpower don't know but her fake smile and demeanor about everything was unacceptable that best and her initial contact with me basically calling me a liar saying that it did not taste like salt it was season season season season which I find ridiculous for her like I said she could not know I think she could have handled it better and I think probably be a better training from Logans for the assistant managers or shift managers would be a better venue for them to make more patrons come back and have a better review on Yelp anyway thank you"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Logan's. If you can get past the peanut shells on the floor, then you'll be a happy camper on the way out. Steak was superb, and our waitress Kristen, was so pleasant and attentive, and deserved every penny of that tip....I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is still in business. Other than the rolls and sweet tea, the food is horrific."}
{"text":"Great food and service both times we went there. Spicy brisket burger was delicious. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I have eating at different Logans and I have had about average experiences.  The food was ok. It could use a little more seasoning. The service was above average. The staff is very friendly.  The good thing is that you can be snacking on the free peanuts while you wait, so even if it takes a little longer, you will not be starving."}
{"text":"This place is great- the service is impeccable and the bartender was so responsive since when we asked to watch a final four game- she literally changed all the channels. The lobster and filet were so tender and delicious and the waitress, Cindy, was so sweet and caring to our children! Ken, the GM, even checked on us- great personality and so fun to talk to!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness oh my goodness! This was an amazing steakhouse. My girlfriend and I went there for her birthday dinner. We ordered the Ribeye steak i ordered the 16oz she the 12 oz, she got hers medium rare and i got mine in between medium and rare. Hers was really good, and juicy with lots of flavor and easy to chew. Mine was very juicy and bloody because i like that type of steak, it was nice and soft so it was really easy to chew as well. Talk about A1 not needed we didnt even touch the A1. Onto the sides, with the steaks you get two sides. I got mac and cheese with the sweet potato fries. It was the best MAC AND CHEESE EVER!!! And my GF does not like mac and cheese. She loved it. The sweet potato fries were amazing. The salads were good and so was the broccoli. The service was fantastic our server knew everything about the steaks on the menu. The atmosphere was also good i loved the peanuts on the floor it was classy! Lol very good restraunt."}
{"text":"Went here with my family. Ordered the ribeye steak while the lady had the burger. Steak was amazing and so tender and she ate all of her burger so I know it had to be good cause she never finishes her food. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"+_+_+_+_+ Logan's is many kangaroo hops ahead of that Australian place +_+_+_+_        Met friends for a movie and dinner.        The steak I and my wife had were $11.99        I wasn't expecting much for this price.  I'm shocked ....... the meal was outstanding. The steak was tender .... tasty .... and juicy. For my two sides ...... I chose a Caesar salad and fries. The fries were very good. Next time ..... I would take a pass on the Caesar salad ...... taste wise it lacked zest and was flat."}
{"text":"Great place loved the pulled pork,  really friendly I will be going back"}
{"text":"If you have an out of state id, they might refuse to serve you a beer or mixed drink, ir happen to my daughter. Long story short she's 32 and was refused even with her legal id from out of state and her nc birth certificate. And this was by the manager. Have called several times and have not been called back yet, its been 2weeks,I guess they can't stand feedback."}
{"text":"I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium, all of them came out well done. Kind of disappointed, but oh well.  So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over. When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.  When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted. I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal. It really was a good steak.  When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly. I assured her it was fine. A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it. I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal. They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous. :)  When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.  Great customer service, and very good food."}
{"text":"I recently went for the 2nd time and I was very disappointed. I raved about my first visit to the location in Gilbert. But unfortunately I received the worst customer service this time around. The waitress was so unprofessional and rude, I literally had to ask for a new one. They definitely accommodated for my guest and I, and also apologized. But then the food took forever and it came out at different times. They also forgot some items and the portions were very small. I definitely will not be back to this location. But i must say the food was yummy."}
{"text":"A nice casual steak place. The steaks are ok but I think the real highlight is the dinner rolls.  The prices are a bit higher than their competition and not quite as good but it's one of the better places in the Norterra area that is kid friendly that offers \"adult\" food."}
{"text":"Love this place and you can't beat the special Mon-Wed, Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I am glad I came back a second time.   My first experience was on a day when they were a little short staffed due to people calling in sick (I overheard the bartender) and my order was messed up that day.   However, we returned for a happy-hour-take-out session and were really pleased. I never had to ask for another beer - only say \"yes\" or \"no\" and I love that in a bartender. It was pretty busy and we were very, very attended to by both bartenders.   I am very picky about mac-n-cheese and Logan's was pretty good. Also, I realize not everyone loves meatloaf, but I LOVE a good slice of ground-n-baked cow flesh if it's done right. Logan's ML was pretty good - finished with a little char on the grill and a side of gravy. The serving was huge and I had enough for breakfast.   Yes, meatloaf for breakfast. Don't judge me...   We'll be back for happy hour and takeout again and again cuz it's by our favorite movie theater as well. Good job kids..."}
{"text":"Had a great Sunday lunch at Logan's today. Fast and responsive service. Plenty of room for our party of 13 and 2 babies! We would've had to wait for 2 hours anywhere else, but we're able to get seated quickly due to the upper seating area. With our large party we will be coming back here more often for Sunday lunch. Service and food was great."}
{"text":"Love this place... The servers are always friendly and the bread is amazing!!! The meals are usually large enough to split and the cost is right!!! This is one of my family's favorite places!"}
{"text":"I am giving it 3 stars because the service is usually good, the prices are decent, but the dozen or so times we have gone it's always to cold and too loud.  Sitting directly across from my loud mouth husband, i cant hear him speak.  Because the climate is so cold, my food always gets cold pretty fast.  I went tonight and smartly purchased a salad but my husband got a steak that was cold within minutes.  Also, $4.00 for a nonalcoholic ice tea without refill, seriously? Every time we go, on the way there we ask whats going to be wrong today, as we leave, why did we come here again?  It's because its close and there is never a line."}
{"text":"Logan's isn't the best steak in town by any means... but it's a great place for the money. My family and I o there at least twice a month because they have such great deals on Tuesday nights. They have a great deal for two people for about 15 bucks that you just can't beat!  Their warm rolls are about the best I've ever had. Great atmosphere and friendly service. I consider this place a real bargain for family dining.  There is always an odd smell around this location though... not sure what causes it. But I guess they can't control the parking lot."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual but it was the service that set this place apart. This is the first place we've ever been to that asked us to cut into our steaks to check to make sure they were cooked to our specification. This little gesture really upped the ante for other reataurants."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience.  Took 1/2 hour to get our beverages and over an hour for our food. When we finally got food, the side dishes and rolls never made it to the table.   The Ribeye steak was so fatty it was inedible.  The real slap in the face was the military discount.  A whopping 10 cents off our 1lovely dining experience."}
{"text":"Second time that I've been here and both times we were treated right. Great service and good food! Unlike at Famous Dave's where we were treated like trash and they could care less. Good for you Logan's Roadhouse staff for living in the 21st century and leaving racism out the door."}
{"text":"Smelled so bad of dirty carpet and mildew, i turned around and walked out!  Went down the street and had a great salad at O'Charley's"}
{"text":"I habe been to this location a few times and it was a decent. Went with my husband on a monday at 1130am for an early lunch.  There were people waiting to be seated a head of us. All the tables were avaiable and it seemed like no staff was present. Was told it was a 15 min wait. So we waited and waited.. thr hostess seemed frazzled and the manager looked lost as to were to seat anyone. The couple in front of us who was seated was told by the hostess the waiter will be with them in 10 mins. We left. Im clueless as to what the problem was."}
{"text":"Good food,  great prices,  our family enjoys goimg here.  Its sorta hit and miss on who you het as a server,  but we enkoy Logans.   Love the peanut bucket."}
{"text":"What a great place. My bride and I always get the 2 for $15.99.  That's two entree and 4 sides.  We each get one, I usually opt for the sirloin either mashed potatoes and MAC n' cheese.   Order one for the restaurant and one to go.  With the fresh buns, I usually cannot finish my first meal, so I end up taking half that home too.  For 15 dollars, I end up with at least three, sometimes four meals. Now that's a bargain!  Food is always good and the service is great. Fast, friendly servers, (especially Aubrey), they will help making recommendations and the manager will always stop by to see how the experience has been."}
{"text":"Here's the bad news: Maybe it's just me, but I don't like walking across peanut shells to get to my table. I guess some people think it's fun to throw shells on the floor. The environment is otherwise just fine and the menu has plenty to offer. My husband got a burger and I got the grilled meatloaf with a salad and mac n' cheese as a side. The hamburger tasted of bread filler and the meatloaf was like someone had spilled a bottle of onion powder into the mix. OH - I almost forgot. The water is undrinkable and tastes terrible. The server said they get a lot of comments on that and that they filter it but I wondered with what. They gave me a soft drink instead, but even that had the unfiltered water mixed in with it.   Here's the good news: they serve excellent warm rolls while you're waiting for your food. I could have eaten just these. They have plenty of beer for people who like that, and since the water is awful, bottled beer might be a good bet."}
{"text":"From Saturday 02/04/17 at 17:00:  We've been regular customers of Logan's Roadhouse for 8 years now.  The last 3 weeks we were there, (new Manager?)  what is SUPPOSED to be background music was way too loud.  I couldn't EVEN hear my dinner companions.   Tonight our Hostess seated us right UNDER a blasting speaker in the dining area.   TERRIBLE MUSIC and WAY TOO LOUD!!!   I objected and nothing got done. (Perhaps the young lady couldn't HEAR me?)   I complained to our server who at LEAST moved us to another table I asked to speak with the Manager, but that never happened?  I don't think we'll return in the NEAR future.  Most restaurants with both Bar and dining areas will at least provide dining areas with quiet background music."}
{"text":"Soo good! The food is great! The servers are understanding and will trade out your food if you do not like it!"}
{"text":"Love it great service ... Great food come on happy hr and Monday to Wed you will save tons of $$$"}
{"text":"45 min wait time but well worth it. Was concerned with the avg reviews but glad we came.  Food was well above par and the service was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Needs to work on cleanliness ( not talking about peanut shells) service was good. Food was normal for that chain. Tap beer wasn't tasting right."}
{"text":"Great food, really nice server, friendly manager stopped by 3 times. Really enjoyed our birthday dinner and the complimentary brownie! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came to try it out for the first time. Happy hour specials are a bargain for drinks and small apps. Server was friendly and non intrusive. Now for the food, we weren't anticipating the best BBQ but it was sub par at best. Ribs were fork tender but lacked flavor. Sirloin stated it was 6oz buy it looked 4oz at best even at raw it was about 5oz. Fries were on the verge of burnt. I don't like being a critic but I appreciate good food. Oh and last none of the stalls in the women's bathroom had toilet paper. Per my upset wife!!"}
{"text":"I read tons of reviews and was intrigued. I had to check this place out. The food was good and my waitress was great so I had to give 5 stars. They weren't busy and I was by myself. I would come back.   I can see why there are complaints though. A table next to me complained that it took 45 min to get their food. I almost laughed out loud based on the reviews. The hostess had a little trouble seating me in an almost empty restaurant, and said she was the only one there that evening.  This place has potential. I feel the management could step it up a bit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here 2 weeks ago and its never disappointing. My whole family really loves it too. Great accommodations for large groups. I highly recommend if you have a wheelchair user in your group"}
{"text":"Love this place, I had the \"Santa Fe Tilapia\" with rice  and grilled vegies.  Along with the beer and free peanuts it was a wonderful meal.  A good time was had by all!!"}
{"text":"So I sent the private message as requested and no one got back with me.  My review was 100% correct and if you check any of my reviews you would see I am do not bash any establishment only speak to my experience.  So let's double down on this one.  You are a seriously nasty place to eat from my one experience as told in my previous review.    I give everyone a bad day but your follow up and lack of it helps me conclude I will never, ever, ever ever, ever ever ever eat at an establishment that does not understand how to wash eating utensils they provide as clean to their customers.   I wish there was a ZERO star option!  Should have called the health department."}
{"text":"Bummed. Today is my birthday and I thought it would be fun to have a quick lunch treat with my little 16 month old. We got there right at 11 to avoid a crowd. The server greeted us fairly quickly and then disappeared for a while. It was about 1115 before we got our drinks. And then we had to wait for the bread to finish cooking. His meal came out first, which was nice so I could feed him. My meal took quite a while and then the steak came over cooked and flavorless. There was a table that was seated well after I had my salad that received their 4 meals ahead of mine. They must have known that I probably wasn't coming back because the manager never came over after the steak problem.  The server was nice and did apologize but didn't fill my water once. I'm not a picky person but this was just too many things to go wrong."}
{"text":"We went for dinner to Logan's.  We had the Country Fried Steak and Meat Loaf, both were excellent.  Our server was Tucker, who was attentive and quick.  I would recommend Logan's for a nice, casual dinner.  Oh yes, don't forget to throw the peanut shells on the floor."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and have had mixed feelings about his place. The first time I went was a wonderful time. Great food, great service, and price was just right.   Second time was very lack luster. After the great time I had last time I thought to bring my family because of my high expectations. This time we were greeted by the hostess who took our names down said 15-20 min wait. We were waiting for some time and after 20 I thought OK it was busy so whatever that can't be helped. As I noticed further there were people who JUST walked in and got a seat. I would like to say that these people were not ones who had a reservation because they came in took there name down like me then 2min later were seated. We were forgotten plain and simple. I waited a little longer to see if we would be noticed. It happened again. Then the last straw was that a group of 15 people walk in and were seated before us. The first girl the hostess seemed alarmed that we were not seated and said \"oh my god she forgot you.\" it wasn't until another waitress came by and said that they had a reservation. They way she said that to me seemed like she just didn't care. The hostess saw us to our seats right away. The waitress then had was much more enjoyable than the other one. I wish I got her name because she was very helpful and apologetic towards us. The food was wonderful and the price was great. Other than the first encounter it was an enjoyable dinner.   The third time was a nice evening. It was myself and my boyfriend. Seated in about 15 min on a busy Wednesday night. The waitress was very attentive and got out orders in and out in no time. Kudos to the cook that night my steak was grilled perfectly.   Overall I am not sure what to make of this place. The service seems to be a 50/50 when you go in. The food is great and the prices at that place just can't be beat."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at this Logan's since it opened.  Not sure why I waited so long to write a review... I love this place.  The food is delicious (get something that comes with Peppercorn dressing, and you will NOT be disappointed), the servers are friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is family friendly and fun.   I took my husband there for a post-Father's Day dinner and we had the pleasure of sitting in Chris' section.  He was awesome - never left us needing anything.   The manager walks around frequently and asks everyone if there is anything he can do for them, or if the service/food has been satisfactory.  Thats how you run a business! Oh, and order the sweet potato. I swear..."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service with amazing food. I love their Catfish and tartar sauce that is home made.  Great atmosphere to go along with their signature drinks."}
{"text":"Service was poor. There were probably 30 employees and two other tables. The waiter was very unfriendly, our food was brought out separately so we couldn't even eat together.... pretty gross inside, bathrooms were dirty... Do not come if your child has peanut/tree nut allergies peanuts everywhere, which adds to the grossness of this place, it just felt dirty...our waiter paid no attention to us. Food was disgusting my hubby got steak with Swiss and mushrooms he said it tasted like they took a can of cold mushrooms and dumped them onto his plate.. and that the cheese was pretty horrible..."}
{"text":"We have been to Logan's many times but it had been a few months since our last visit. I tried to call to get a reservation, no only parties of 8 or more. So our party of 2 arrived at 6:30 and they place was only half full. Three employees standing at the hostess country talking, we had to interrupt them to ask for a table. We got a table and started reviewing the menu. WOW! prices have really gone up! The music was so loud we had to almost yell at each other. I ask twice the waiter about the music, he said its loud so you don't hear the kitchen. REALLY?  The other tables never filled in, service was good, food was not matching the prices. I predict, next time we try Logan's it won't be Logan's."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location on 2 different visits. 1st visit to sit at the bar and watch the yotes/blackhawks game. I ordered the NY strip Med and 2 vegetable skewers. When I get my steak I cut into a raw cold piece of meat. I sent it and then proceeded to get a well done piece of meat. I asked the bartender if he ever ate steaks here and he said he had one before he came in. The 3rd steak came out I cut into and me and the bartender both agreed it was med, but what nearly killed me was the ton of seasoning the chef must have put on my steak. I have never drank so much water after eating a steak. My 2nd attempt to eat here was last week on their dime. I ordered the porterhouse and again was served a raw disaster; I ate only because I had been up quite early and hadn't eaten lunch. The waitress asked me why I didn't ask for it cooked more. My reply was I was hungry and last time it came out way saltier than before. She went and got her manager and he proceeded to tell me that a Porter house is best served med-rare. I said well I have been eating steaks for quite a few years, I am 47 and grew up in Texas and I have never heard that. I told him to keep his gift card and left. I would rather eat at Outback or Texas Roadhouse where I can always get a steak done right."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and skip this hell-hole. If you insist on going then make sure you wear proper shoes. They let customers throw peanut shells on the floor and it reeked like an old, moldy cellar."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars ......We came to Phoenix for a conference and wanted to try someplace new to eat dinner. This restaurant was close by so we thought we would give it a try. To our dismay, our order took nearly an hour to come out. Although it was late, my wife's order was correct, she had the fried meatloaf, but her words were \"it wasn't that great of  plate\". On the other hand, my order, the Brisket burger, was brought out wrong. When I mentioned that we waited a very long time for the order to be incorrect, the server simply said \"yeah, it seems all of our orders are comming out late tonight\"..... not the best answer in my book. In the end my order was replaced correctly and taken off the bill, but I had to take it in a to go box because by the time it was brought out everyone was done eating and ready to go."}
{"text":"Our visit did not go well. We normally love Logan's, but so much went wrong at this location, we will never go back. The four of us were seated with only one of the four cutlery sets we needed.  They were bringing fresh hot rolls to all the surrounding tables, but not to us (until we asked). There seemed to be about a 10-minute response-time for any requests we made. My wife loves the Strawberry Stormie drinks, but they don't have those on the menu anymore.  We asked if one could be made, and it took the server a long time to come back, saying 'No', they couldn't make it, despite having a full bar.  I mean, the drink is just strawberries, ginger ale, spiced rum, ice.... not hard.  But he mumbled something about 'not being able to enter it into the computer.' Anyway, we asked for extra napkins, and he didn't bring any.  So when one of our kids spilled water, we couldn't clean it up (until finally I just grabbed napkins from an adjacent table). We waited about 40 minutes (long time) to be served our main course.  They didn't bring all the food out together, so my son was crying because he was hungry (it's a long time to wait when you're 5) and watching the rest of us eat for an additional 5 minutes until they brought his food. A lot of these are \"little things\" but when you add it all up, it was a pretty bad experience."}
{"text":"Good service, very mediocre steak, sides and dessert."}
{"text":"Definitely needed more wait staff for a Sunday there are 15 or more tables open and we are had to wait for a table... really? Not impressed....waited 30 minutes for a table due to staffing - no excuse, sorry. On the plus side, service was good, food was good, and salad was fresh."}
{"text":"Just got here and the service sucks. She doesn't like her job. Par, I knew we should have went to Longhorns. Always had a less then good experience at Logans."}
{"text":"Stopped in for supper Sunday. The food was 6 on a 10 scale. Overall cleanliness was nasty. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I don't understand the very low scores by some. I know every restaurant can have an off day, maybe that accounts for it.  But for me, I have eaten at this location numerous times and don't remember a bad meal that stands out. I'm a Logan's fan and have eaten at others in this chain in our area, I rate this location at the top hands down."}
{"text":"I went here to try it, thinking it was like Outback or Texas Roadhouse. The food seemed alright, my steak was well done, yet it was the horrible nausea and upset stomach that I got from eating here that put me off from going again. I'm sure that if I went back I might like it but I'm not willing to risk it."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Wednesday. It was fuller than I would have thought. I ordered the fried chicken salad. The chicken was good but there was some brown lettuce and they didn't bring out the rolls until after the salad I ordered. Service was friendly but a little slow."}
{"text":"I'm a simple guy with a simple job, who enjoys the simple things in life. The environment is key to their success, makes me feel like a cow boy way back in the west. I'm a top guy, like to feel superior. All I can say is I felt like I was in charge in that situation. Service was speedy fast like lighten MCQueen. I got to watch the sport of basketball while going to town on a burger, don't worry I got it dinner first though. 4/5 stars so recommend!"}
{"text":"They must have had a different Juan cooking in the back. Because something wasn't right.  First time we went. I loved it.   BUT... When we went back... this past weekend. TOTAL let down. One of the worst steaks I've had in a long time. Way to dry. No flavor at all.   I love Logan's. But damn...They need to step it up."}
{"text":"Summer, our waitress, really tried.  However,  she could not overcome the freezer burnt shrimp.  The shift manager was less than impressive with her lip stud and pierced tongue.  With the number of people out of work, you would think they could do better."}
{"text":"Love Logan's! I go once a month with my sister the manager and staff is always great and make you feel welcomed! I always get the Logan which is a sirloin with two sides usually get a salad and mashed potatoes the gravy is amazing! I love the croutons and honey mustard dressing. The roadhouse teas are so yummy haven't made myself down the list of all the flavors yet there is so many! Thursday's they are a buck off! The big warm brownie with ice cream is delicious if you want something sweet. Also the rolls are always fresh and hot. I get the cinnamon and honey butter on request. Live this place favorite steakhouse by far."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great the bread was the best part of my meal. Try one of the other 10 restaurants in the area to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service! We were immediately attended to by our server, which is less than we can say for the Cracker Barrel across the street, And had some great food! My son, 5 years old mind you, had the steak tips and are every single one. Great place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was very good fast service if you going to have a steak brewski sirloin they are very good"}
{"text":"We always have a great time when we go there with the family! Great atmosphere! Good prices! Great food! Friendly faces!"}
{"text":"Peanuts and rolls with butter before your meal. Food is okay, prices are okay but not cheap. One thing they have going for them is an amazing peach iced tea. The unsweetened tea is so delicious! I probably wouldn't choose to eat here but have been here a couple times for group events. It's an okay chain place...pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"We stopped here on 9.16.17 for a late lunch / early dinner, just after 3:30. We were seated quickly enough, but that was the highlight of our visit. We were able to review the menu and decide on what to order. However, no one came to the table to greet us, offer drinks, or even say they would be with us at some point in time. One server did say hi as she was walking by, not sure if this was to suggest she would be our server or what her reasoning was. After nearly 10 minutes it was decided to offer an additional minute for someone to come to the table. That minute came and went and so did we. On the way out, I noted to the hostess we were leaving because no one ever came to the table. She just kind of shrugged her shoulders and said ok. A few minutes later we were at another restaurant where the service was great, I definitely know which restaurant I'll go into the future. Hint, it's not Logans."}
{"text":"Came in at about 630 and it wasn't very busy. Took a long time to get our drinks the peanut bucket was nothing but shells the table was dirty the waitress got our drinks wrong . Our food took about 40 mins to come out. The fries tasted old the burger was over cooked the nachos didn't have much sustenance . The sliders tasted awful and so did the steak sandwich . First and last trip to Logan's roadhouse ."}
{"text":"We were hungry and tired after a long flight filled with airport delays,  etc. so decided to try this steakhouse close to our hotel.  Service was initially good but my husband had to ask several times for extra napkins and for his salad to be brought to the table.   When the food came, my husband's potato was cold as were my shrimp.   They did replace those items but the shrimp at best were lukewarm.   They took nothing off the bill to compensate.   Sorry but will not be back."}
{"text":"We love this place. If my steak is not right I never have to worry they always get the manager without me having to ask and make a new one.  They don't make you work to fix it mistake and I appreciate that! The manager is often helping serve food and always comes by to introduce themselves. It's refreshing that they take quick responsibility to take care of you. :) The food never dissapoints and the kids love the peanuts!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. They started cleaning around me. Why let me in the door if you are not going to stay open?"}
{"text":"It really sucks I am forced to give it at least one star. A NO STAR would be more than generous for our experience here. Unless we just had bad luck and picked the worst items on the menu, the food was horrible. Mesquite Chicken was dry. Fried cheese bacon burger was flavorless. The \"special\" broccoli and cheese side item was swimming in a sauce that barely disguised the awful burnt/scorched taste of the broccoli. Ketchup bottle completely empty. Our sever never checked to refill our drinks. Only when we asked for the bill. Will not return to this restaurant. Texas Roadhouse is superior to this \"restaurant.\""}
{"text":"I wouldn't take my dog to eat at this place. It was bad from service to food. We went 3 times and each time it got worse. They need a new cook and employees who care. Disgusting don't go...you have been warned."}
{"text":"Carlos was our waiter/bar keep.  He first came to our table without a paper and pen to take the order but I thought maybe this guy was that good.  He returned to our table about 15 minutes later and told my wife and I that they lost the appetizer ticket and that the manger would cover the appetizer.  And the manager did.   He then brought our our entrees and put mine in front of my wife and vise versa.   We asked my wife's steak to be well done but it can out medium. Since they were covering the appetizer we didn't want to make a stink.  I noticed that my receipt had loaded baked potatoes on it but we didn't order them that way and he didn't ask. Our issue is not the facility or the food its with Carlos.  They need to get rid of this guy or train him better.    We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This location of Logan's is absolutely horrendous. I have come here with my roommate twice, and both times there have been issues. The first time that we came, we arrived on a weeknight when it wasn't crowded at all. There were many booths open and cleaned, so there was a lot of seating to choose from. The host that was there did not even bother to greet us. He just grabbed two menus and started walking, so  we followed behind. Okay... It gets worse though. Since we were not asked initially whether or not we wanted a booth or a table (as I stated before, there were many open ones) I asked very politely if we could sit at a nearby booth. Instead of responding, this host had the fucking nerve to ROLL HIS EYES and sigh loudly like we were some type of pain-in-the-ass to him - all over a very small and simple request. As soon as that happened, we turned right around and left the place. That experience alone wa s beyond appalling.  Our second time there, which we still were on edge about because of what happened the last time, proved to be another bad one for the books. Our server was very spacey and had each one of us repeat our orders at least 4 times. He acted very peculiar and took off with our menus without really saying anything to us or bothering to check up on us when we finally did get our meals, which was 45 minutes later. We came on a quiet night during the week again, so there were only two other tables that were occupied at the time. Both of our orders were messed up and had to be remade several times. Undercooked and rotten steak. Not to mention, we didn't even get the meals comped, so I just had it replaced with some chicken fingers (it's a miracle at this point that those weren't messed up either).  We have gone to the other Logan's location in Gilbert at San Tan Village and have never had a bad experience. If you are going to Logan's, I would recommend going to that location instead. Stay the hell away from this Riverview location!!!"}
{"text":"We were quickly seated, promptly served and the waitress was very attentive.  The manager came by making his rounds to make sure everyone was being taken care of.  Their rolls were just like Grandma used to make. I had the 8 oz filet medium rare w blue cheese and It was so tender it melted in my mouth like butter.   Soooo good.  Will definately return !!!!!"}
{"text":"I Grabbed some to Go for my daughter and decided get a beer. Payed way to much for it.  $4.60 for a 16 ounce domestic is way to lmuch when I can go across the street and get a great craft beer for less at mellow."}
{"text":"it was just good but there was something missing the bar tender only came over one time to check on us I would go back"}
{"text":"Given that my friend was about to leave hospital and I live in charlotte i ordered to go. They were out of sweet pototos at 7pm so i ordered half rack of ribs. They gave me to poor excuses of side ribs with a dab of sauce. I ordered pork chops which I'm use to the one n Statesville giving me two nice side of chops. I also ordered a half dozen if rolls which I received 8 of. I figured that since your meals are supposed to come with some i feel like maybe I could've received more."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great Service.  I am a fan of their zucchini appetizer, I definitely recommend.  Its a big portion, and I got to take some home.  Even after re-frying it in the fry pan, it was still yummy.  I had salmon/shrimp combo plate.  It was good, nothing spectacular.  I would imagine their specialty here is red meat, though.  I'll have to try that next time I'm around here.  What truly impressed me was that the MOD on duty for that night was helping serve & bus tables.  I love it when managers anywhere are a true part of the team and don't mind getting their hands dirty.  Service was good, drinks never went empty, napkins always available and offered more.  Waitress brought extra ranch for appetizer because she felt like there isn't enough served with the plate.   Good overall experience, I shall return.  I do recommend, and maybe next time I'll try some type of red meat and give a higher score."}
{"text":"Chose this Logan's over another and regretted it. They have 8 steaks on the menu and on Sunday night all they had left to serve was a 6oz sirloin and a 9 oz filet mignon. Server didn't seem to care ... Just said sorry. Service was extremely slow. Waited 15 minutes to get the check when we were done. Food was just ok. Won't be back. Sad that we wasted a night out on this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in because it was local, we were thirsty and hungry.  This place seems quite impressive from the exterior but failed to impress.  It was a Wednesday night we ordered appetizers (Nachos and Buffalo Wings).  Both plates were fine, nothing unique or special about it.   Since I was in town visiting chances are I won't be returning nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my meal. I had the French dip with a baked potato. The baked potato was fine. The French dip - far from it. The meat tasted funny & the bread was stale. Not a dining experience I want to repeat."}
{"text":"Went to Logan's steakhouse for my boyfriends birthday. While the service was decent, our steaks came out incredibly well done when asking for medium. The server advised she would discount the meal. When we got the check, the meal was not discounted. As she didn't come back anytime soon and because it was my boyfriends birthday and we had places to be, we didn't have time to wait to bring this up. All in all, steak was NOT enjoyable as it was mostly burnt and we didn't get the discount we were promised. Wouldn't recommend and will not return."}
{"text":"Outback and black angus are better but ligand that is own by olive garden is cheaper."}
{"text":"On Lunch and Kim at the Bar was very helpful and attentive. Food was great as always. Steak cooked perfectly. Kim did a great job of suggesting menu items.  Will return."}
{"text":"Just to let everyone know, I was contacted via Yelp by the manager who offered an apology and to make things right.  There needs to be more people like that."}
{"text":"I usually avoid national chain joints like the plague, but I had a client who wanted to meet here, so we did. It was lunch, and after I checked the reviews about this Logan's, I wasn't really looking forward to it.  I started with the peanuts that they have on the tables for free, they seemed old and half picked through, but it took a while to get our drinks, so I was bored.  The highlight of my meal came next which was the rolls. I love the rolls here, but I'm sure with enough butter and sugar any bread could taste as delicious!  Anyway, I love ribeye's and since the company was paying, I thought why not? I ordered it medium rare, and that's about how it came out, which was nice, but they just don't use quality meat here, so it wasn't really any good. They do an ok job of spicing up the meat to cover up the quality, but I just can't get excited about it.  Anyway, it's fine to eat here if you have to, but if you're looking for something better, there are a ton of options in the neighborhood that I'd go with over Logan's."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions now.   I always end up ordering steak and always end up regretting it.  Rib Eye was very thin cut.  Over cooked. And just not a good piece of meat.   I also had side of Mac & Cheese. I sent it back.  I was not any better than Kraft.  Dinner salad small.   The waitress was attentive and at least managed to keep the drinks full.   I think this is a good place for a happy hour, beer and appetizer.  But I won't be going back for dinner again.  Especially steak!!"}
{"text":"Came in here not knowing what to expect. My family was hungry and we left stuffed and content! The service was excellent! Very friendly server and manager. We were very pleased :)"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good service.  They let you throw peanut shells on floor.  Good food.  Nothing crazy great, but OK."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good food and the I think peanuts on the table and floor is great!  LOL.  The rolls they serve are really good too.  They have quite a few items on their menu that are super tasty and we have yet to have a bad waiter."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to our friends and I was so embarrassed. 2 of us in our party ordered prime rib medium rare. One of us had an end cut and when we mentioned it, we were told it would be another hour before more prime rib would be ready. All of our dinners were stone cold and the manager said he could take it ALL back and fix it. From where I was sitting, I could see the kitchen and all of our plates were headed for the microwave oven. We motioned for our server and told him we did not want out steaks and lobster tails heated in the microwave. He apologized, we left and we will NEVER, EVER, go here again. The manager was totally unprofessional and clueless in solving this situation."}
{"text":"Friendly staff: the host, our waitress and expediter.   Food is what I expected: ribeye steak medium, cooked very well with enough seasoning not requiring more.   Drinks were great: strawberry lemonade I even took home to finish.    What I would change: not sitting nearby other cranky customers who feel they need to complain about everything and have no class to politely ask for what they want nor do they know how to tell time 5 minutes is apparently 15. Anyway I'm lady justice so I always have to right someone's wrong - the customer didn't leave a tip so I left more on mine since we shared a waitress between our tables and I already got $4 off with a coupon. I hope this customer doesn't ruin the waitress' day."}
{"text":"Look fo coupons! Great bread. Good food."}
{"text":"Visited this place after an awesome winery tour and tasting. Was seated right away, but took about 5 minutes for anyone to come and greet us at the table. The place was empty, not very busy. So we left and went to showmars next door. It seems that this place is more interested in employees giggling and having a good time than offering great service. I WILL NOT RETURN!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were a little too salty, but other than that, everything was good. The staff is friendly. The Georgia punch was the best alcoholic drink I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have dined here. The service is always great, but the quality of the food is seriously lacking. Tonight I ordered a 6 ounce steak, medium rare, with sweet potato and butter. When delivered, and cutting into my steak, it was beyond rare, cold and I could not eat it. The potato was cold as well, as the butter wouldn't even melt. When our server came by, I showed her the plate, and her response was, oh my god it's raw! She took the plate back to the kitchen, and brought a new plate a few minutes later. The steak was half the size of the first one, and it was still rare and cold. She stood there while I cut into it, and again stated that it was raw. She said that the kitchen was in a hurry and wanted to close early. I said please take it away, as I won't eat this.  It is not the servers fault. This is the LAST time we dine at Logan's. The couple across from us asked if our food was cold and raw, and I said yes. They stated that their dinner was cold and raw as well, and would not be back as well. Sorry Logan's, but you lost our business tonight, along with several other guests."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. We actually got off rte 17on our way home for Red Robbins but decided last minute on Logans as they have a special banner and kids meals for $3.?? since the kids only pick at their meals. Leslie our waitress was AMAZING!! Best service ever. She brought the kids food out first which was nice for once. She brought us extra napkins and water without the need of us to ask. She also recommended a mango citrus drink...and it was delicious. Our meals included Cole slaw, house salad (freshest I've ever seen) Chilli (yummy) veggie skewers, and baked potato ;) teriyaki chicken and bourbon bbq chicken....food was delicious and the bread basket was kept full. Our total was about $35 for a party of 4."}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. Nathan, with his smooth Matthew McConaughey accent and self assured manner, served us sweet, soft, hot rolls with butter and a can of peanuts to eat and throw shells on the floor. My El Jimador Blanco 100% Agave Margarita was sweet, large and tasty for only $4 on the happy hour menu (3-6 and 8-10pm). Country music played. The wait staff wore flannel shirts and jeans and I felt like I was down south. The Caesar salad came in a properly chilled bowl with generous slices of shaved cheese and croutons that tasted like crunchy garlic bread. The mesquite plank grilled salmon with butter dill sauce and steamed broccoli was moist and well seasoned. Hubby had the 1/2 rack of braised baby back ribs that were so tender, they fell off of the bone. Excellent service, good food. Enjoyable experience all around."}
{"text":"Stay away, food was really terrible!  Had ribs and fries based on waiter recommendation, ribs were actually cold, fries were cold...ribs were dry and tasteless.  Worst meal out in years, shame on you, Logan!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Hot and delicious. Cynthia are server was great. She kept the bread filled and our drinks NEVER went empty. I will definitely be back. I highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"This place was snotty rude and poopy im still trying to ignore the fact that the person siting next to us didn't know how to change a dipper which wasn't as bed as nasty steak stuck in the middle of my teeth over all the commercial was a big waste of my time and the only thing good their was the ice not even the water because that stuff was nasty"}
{"text":"THE WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD AT A LOGAN'S. From start to finish it was terrible. Our waitress catered to other guests so long that we needed a new waiter. Our order came wrong on one plate then was fixed but the tenders came back over breaded and cooked. One steak order came way under cooked... it just progressively got worse. My suggestion is take your business elsewhere. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. I honestly believe the staff was racist, being a small group of natives watching other people being served noticeably more attentive than us."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing too special.   Service was awful.    Drink refills were non existent, finally hot refil after the meal was completed.   Asked for roll refil which never came.   Never received at condiments that were requested (one person had a burger and wanted mustard).  Staff all was not overly friendly to the point the impression is nobody wanted to be there.   Waitress nor the manager ever came by to ask how everything was.  Would not recommend this location"}
{"text":"I like this place for a simple dinner. Good prices on steak, salads, etc. Please be warned that the \"onion petals\" are NOT the same as the blooming onion at Outback like your server will tell you. That being said service is OK (kind of slow at times, and not too personable). And you can't beat $2.99 beers and 2/$14 meals! Love their rolls and peanuts!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch.. seated promptly.. drink came quickly. Ordered the grilled meatloaf. Side of chili.. chili arrived in a reasonable time.. then the wait.. and the wait.. and the wait.. probably a good 20-25 minutes. Server finally came back by, and asked about my order, told him that I hadn't seen it. He went back and checked.. hadn't even been started.. so instead of asking, he went ahead and got it going. He was very apologetic,  said that the manager would be by.. she came, offered to pick up desert.. ok, nice but I didn't have time for it then.. so she said, let me take care of something.. cool.. I get the bill, $3.84 discount. My Coke, $2.49. so, the message that I got is that my time is worth about half of what  minimum wage is. The food was ok, the temperature was not what I would have expected being right off the grill, in fact, it was a little on the cold side. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fist of all, the biscuits are Amazing!! We never have trouble finishing off our small basket. They also have a bucket of peanuts on your table that you can eat and toss the shells on the floor. Not the most fancy place, but it's great for a casual date/dinner. Every time I have been here (3-4times now) the staff has always been pleasant. The food is always up to standard. Their salads are always fresh which is important to me (I love a good salad). The steaks are cooked to your request, and I haven't had any issues with that here either!"}
{"text":"Want a lot of dinner for for a little money? Come here! The 2 for $14.99 deal is every day now (just earlier thur-sun). You get two sides and an entree. I always get chicken strips and you get so many I take plenty home to eat the next day for lunch. The rolls are delicious, and the servers are always willing to bring you more. Service is outstanding here - always quick to refill drinks and get you anything you need. Fried pickle app is tasty! Happy hour beers are cheap. Would highly recommend! Oh and there are peanuts :-)"}
{"text":"went into the restaurant hoping to have a couple if beers. bartender was so busy counting his money and didn't even acknowledge us so we left after about 10 minutes without even a hello I'll be right with  you"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. I had good service both times, but the food is not great and not cheap either.  The website has minimal location specific information like prices and details about specials such as days of the week and hours when specials are valid.    The first time I ordered \"to go\" and had the grilled meatloaf which was a little burnt and very dry. I'm not sure why it would occur to something to grill meatloaf, but I don't think this stuff would be good even if it had not been grilled. (and meatloaf should be easy to get right, right?). As as side, I ordered the loaded mashed potatoes and they were anything but loaded -- and I was charged extra for \"loaded\", something I wasn't made aware of when I ordered.  I was also charged extra for another item as well... I think it was a side that I ordered for the kids meal that wasn't on the \"approved\" sides list for kids meals (something not made clear on the website or by the person taking my order). I can't stand places that nickel and dime you, esp. when they don't tell you before hand. Also, I placed my order over the phone and was called back about 10 mins later with the price... really? In this day and age?  I gave this place another try and dined in the second time. I had the fried cheese bacon burger which was very mediocre (just a regular slice of cheese for me please) and not cooked to my specifications (ordered medium rare and got well done).  The onion pedals were fine and admittedly had a pretty good tasting horseradish sauce.  We also had the potato skins... Ok but lacking in bacon.  The best thing about this place is probably the bread.  Considering the prices of this place (I think it was over $9.50 for the burger and over $12 + surplus charges for the meatloaf) and the lack of good food, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night for \"Burger and Brew\" special. Burger was tasty it had bacon and a fried piece of cheese. Service was so/so, had to have bill corrected was charged regular price not special. Not good customer service, always double check the bill. Liked the peanut they have at the table."}
{"text":"Had an awesome waitress, kept up with refills & checked on us often.  Had the sirloin steak, salad & broccoli.   Steak nice & hot and cooked a perfect medium well.  Everything timed out well too - wasn't still eating half my salad when meal came out.  Hubby had bacon cheeseburger that was juicy & hot, fries done well.  It's a steakhouse, you kinda know what to expect.  This one did quite well!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I've had about everything on the Monday-Wednesday menu. I think the salmon and BBQ chicken are my meals. Sweet potato fries and cinnamon apples are the only sides I've ever had here. Hahah.   The bread is straight addicting! So buttery!"}
{"text":"I go back about every six months hoping the service has improved, but after having been seated by the hostess, we have to flag down a member of the wait staff just to get a drink order.  I have a self imposed 10 minute rule that if they don't take my drink order after 10 minutes, I'm walking.  It's got to 9 minutes the last two visits.  Maybe I'm just too impatient."}
{"text":"Lousy service, waitresses with attitude and slow service make this a MUST AVOID. If you are nearby go to the Bell Road & I-17 location instead!"}
{"text":"went here on the Friday right before mothers day for dinner for a early mothers day and a late bday dinner for my 5 year old. got seat fairly fast, got our drink order, then sat and waited for what seemed like forever and a day for her to come back and get our order. got the loaded potato's for an appetizer, which were a lil over cooked and rubbery.  so after we got our order taken we then asked her if we could get the rolls, that seemed like every other table had, she seemed annoyed we even asked and she said well i guess and walked off. its like damn don't like your job then go find something else, because like i said it wasn't that busy. over all save your money and go to Texas roadhouse because this place was crappy. the food was so so."}
{"text":"We arrived at approximately 5:15, not exactly busiest time so I thought we could get in and cotinue on with our life. After the host /hostess was staring at a piece of paper for several minutes we were seated at a table  peanut shells on  table, but no big deal. We truly sat there waiting for somebody to take a drink order for over 5 minutes. People would come in after us and were getting taken care of before us. Unfortunately, this has happened to us on one other occasion, so the lesson has been learned. We will not go back to logans ever again, unless we want to enjoy watching people eat, while not actually eating ourselves."}
{"text":"First of all the waitress Yessie was fabulous... with her great service, everything was great and no complaints.  The salad, rolls,  ahhhhh, the rolls and butter, then mash potatoes and gravy with the Logan steak cooked how I like it.  I'm full and satisfied....thank you!  Noticed the other servers too, they were also providing great service and all the servers were smiling and looking like they were having fun."}
{"text":"I've had positive experiences here. I have come four times, mostly during the week, and have had good service and food. I was a little hesitant returning to Logan's after my experience in Mesa, but I decided to give it another go. This location is closer to home, and I'm glad for it. The rolls here are always awesome. The food is decent and the price is right."}
{"text":"Been to this Logan's a number of times. Always come for happy hour and sit at the bar. Very nice friendly bartenders. Usually order the no bone ribeye. Always a great steak. Very tasty tender and a nice size. A very good value."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner. Service was great, staff was friendly. Food was ok, not great. I got a fried cheese bacon burger, the bun was so hard I could barely bite through it. The cheese patty was larger than the burger patty, I took it off the burger. The fries were good though. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. They had no beer or drink specials either."}
{"text":"I have never been here before but I was meeting my mother in law for lunch and she chose the venue. I have eaten at Texas Roadhouse before and she said it was basically the same. Ermmmm.............no it isn't. We were seated in a booth and the wait staff were pretty friendly and welcoming. After we had placed our orders, we were offered bread which we declined, as I think that may have been too much food, however, after reading these reviews, I wish we had accepted. My MIL had a burger and fries that looked pretty good and she said it tasted OK, but I ordered a sandwich from the specials menu. It was either brisket or pulled pork (I can't remember but it tasted like neither) and was a dry, grey color, smoked sausage and bacon. These were OK but the pulled-whatever-it-was was stringy, cold and had a very odd flavor. I asked for a side of mayo and was brought 2 sachets by two different servers. I hate to sound petty, but in about 99% of the sit-down and be served restaurants I have been to, you will get your dressing in a little pot or something. We then decided to order dessert. We got 3 tiny desserts in buckets between us (you got to keep the buckets and my MIL fell in love with them). We had a brownie and shared a cheesecake. The cheesecake was ok but the brownie was awful. Cold, hard pieces of stale brownie stuffed into these buckets with a little blob of icecream on top. Something  was crunchy (who knows what that was) that probably shouldn't have been, and so chewy but not in a good way. Over-all, I would say avoid this place like the plague. It either needs to shake up or close down."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a freaking awesome tasting burger and that is what I got! I also ordered the homemade potato chips and did not want to share it with anybody. They tasted so good. The service was awesome. Love the free peanuts and bread while you wait for your meal. What a clever idea."}
{"text":"Returned to give them a shot after a bad experience months ago. I shared our story with the manager and really have to give them props!    Multiple servers attending our large group and they were very attentive. The food was what we expected and the service exceeded expectations.   We will definitely come back!  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Finally tried a steakhouse that CA doesn't offer. ...The peanuts all over the floor was the first thing that caught my attention..we could just throw them on the ground?! Cool..until I saw that they were scattered on the floor in the booth areas where we sat, the crunching of my feet stepping on them just got kinda old quickly.   Menu had alot of steak and seafood choices, and a full bar. Steak was good but not good enough for me to finish, reminded me of Chili's. I got the Steak and Shrimp plate, which had plenty of fries, broccoli, 3 large buttered shrimp, but the steak should have been the center of attention!  Waiter was really cheerful, attentive, and gave us all the condiments we could annoyingly as him for. Steak plate here is around $20 a person, with 2 sides. Pretty good, but I'll try Texas Roadhouse in order to make up my mind."}
{"text":"First off we had great service. Waitress was friendly and awesome. Food was good too. The rolls and butter are to die for. My husband got a steak (bone in rib eye) and devoured it. I got salmon and get was great. Love love. Would come back if in Mesa, AZ again."}
{"text":"This place has gone down in service and food. Why do you need 3 hostess playing with their hair when the place is half empty.  We were a party of 3 adults and 2 teenagers. Sat in one of the booths that you can get in on either side but for some reason our server decided to hand my husband everyones drink and have him pass them out. Steaks were cooked a little to long and 2 of us added sauté mushrooms to top our steaks and we were luck to get 5 small slices for a extra$1.99. The quality of food was disappointing. Use to love coming here but will not be back anymore."}
{"text":"We love their mid week 2 dinner specials. The steaks that come with those specials are tiny, but I shouldn't be expecting more when I'm paying less. I love their mushroom appetizer, they're very tasty. The wait staff is very kind and go the extra mile for us which makes this place very welcoming. Their Happy Hour prices and hours are nice and easier to catch than other places. The banana cream pie dessert is super sweet but yummy. Their rolls are soft, hot, and delicious."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, but bumped up a star for the outstanding service.  Logan's is a spartan warehouse inside, with the ubiquitous giant pipe ceiling, and cement floors with a chaste smattering of peanut shells.   We were seated and then pretty immediately given a few warm yeast rolls with whipped butter. The rolls were just ok- a little tough and yeasty for my taste. Hubby thought he had just about died and gone to heaven with the big bucket of roasted and salted peanuts on the table. I had a couple and they were tasty. Waters and our drinks came pretty quickly as well. My strawberry margarita was pretty good, and Hubby got the most exotic beer they had- Killian's.   For our main entrees, Hubby had a NY strip and I had a rib-eye. Both arrived more medium than the medium rare we ordered, and when the server stopped by to see how things were, Hubby said the steaks were a little overdone. He apologized, and asked if we wanted new ones. We said, \"no,\" and that it was ok, we didn't want to be wasteful. A manager was at our table a minute later, asking if we were sure. We were super impressed by this- 10x better service than when we last had complaints at the Four Seasons. The sides were alright- mushrooms were sliced and in a heavily seasoned broth, loaded baked potato was standard, but Hubby just loved his baked sweet potato with butter and cinnamon.  At the end of the meal, we were presented with their signature three-tiny-bucket desserts. We hadn't ordered it- it was a surprise comp. One bucket was a rich chocolate mousse with a peanut butter top, another was a hella-sweet warm hot-fudge brownie with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the last was a light cheesecake with strawberry topping. They were all tasty, but my favorite was the cheesecake. Then we got the bill. They had also given us half off both our steaks. We again were quite impressed. Logan's really went above and beyond to make up for a relatively small error. Naturally, we tipped based on what the bill would have been. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Only the prices were the saving grace for this waste of a chain. On Monday through Wednesday you can get two meals for $14 from a limited menu consisting of eight items. You get a salad or two sides with your meal.    Let's start with the stale peanuts that are the signature item at this place where you can throw the shells on the floor. Not sure if they ever change the peanuts out, but this batch at this table were old and they were sent to the floor with their full shells intact. The salads were pre-prepared and chilled and did not make an impact. Even the famous rolls did not seem up to snuff as they were mushy, luke warm and overloaded with butter from a brush. My entree was a wood fired chicken dish that had a chicken breast that had a large swath of fat in the middle. It was doused in a tasteless peppercorn parmesan sauce. No wonder the place was 95% empty at 1pm midweek. The sweet potato was rather large and that was fine, but run from the chain and you will do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"Great ambience, very friendly & efficient servers! The peanuts in the bucket on the tables were fun to eat as you throw the shells right onto the floor!   The fried bacon cheeseburger was fantastic and the chopped steak on mashed potato w/ gravy was equally great!   Watching calories went \"out the window!\"  But in moderation, right?  Besides, we're on vacation!   Try the rolls, too ... heavenly!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was a little weird.  She had dentures and kept spitting on my face unintentionally.  She told us she had dentures.  She made weird inappropriate jokes that made us uncomfortable.  The food was not too bad but not memorable either.  Both the hubby and I agree we might go back but have to get over our last visit first."}
{"text":"I  was in town visiting my brother and sister in law and we went here the day after Christmas. Nothing here saying give us another chance.  Unlike some of the other reviews our server was the bright spot. Not spectacular but friendly, efficient and professional. My brother ordered the grilled meatloaf and was later informed that they were out....the first time ever. Yeah right. We both had ribs which were fall off the bone done but maybe a little over done since they were pretty dry. My sister in law had the rib eye and lobster. She said the lobster which was pretty small was good but she almost sent the steak back because of saltiness and sinew. The overall feel of this location was a little too cookie cutter design with no real ambiance which is what you get at McDonalds. A craft beer or two on tap would have been nice. Budweiser and Coors are fine for the Do-Drop-Inn but with dinner something a little upscale would be expected.  If I'm sitting down for a nice dinner I would like the restaurant to have a little character.  Speaking of sitting down for dinner Bro and I are both tall and the booths do not scream out roomy. Others have compared this to Texas Road House, Logans may strive for that but they fall short. In summery our visit to Logans Roadhouse wasn't unlike that first date where it wasn't bad but nothing seems to really click and the kiss on the doorstep faded from memory pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for reverse happy hour. Awesome drink specials..2 for one well drinks and 5 dollar long islands. Grilled wings were so tasty and fried pickles were yummy! Vanessa was our bartender and she was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu!"}
{"text":"My parents love this place & it's always the place to go when they want to go out to eat. It is what it is...another chain steakhouse. The steaks, salads, fries / baked potatoes are always prepared & cooked nicely.  We've always had good service with the wait staff...they're very attentive & are constantly clearing the table off or filling beverage glasses.  Like Chad, the annoying \"yeeee-haw\" birthday shout out & the constant country music can be a bit much, it's so loud in there, it's unfortunately part of it all. (Chad, hate that you had such a bad experience.) I can endure this eating experience every couple of months. :)"}
{"text":"Short Version It looks like it was either a failed Texas Roadhouse or a very cheap knock off, either way Norterra has plenty more to offer without suffering here.   Food is on a fast food level, all frozen fried/microwaved, if it wasn't for the service I would have given it 2 maybe a 3.  However my overall experience was just terrible.   Waitress and Manager were clueless it took more than 55 mins from the time we gave our credit cards till the time we actually signed the check.   No Appology no comps, Manager seemed pissed that I would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards.   Long version Our waitress was very friendly and pleasant, we asked about HH drinks specially the wine. Now this isn't a place to go for fine wine we realize that, but when we asked which wines were on HH, we were told by our waitress that she didn't drink and didn't know the wines.... or how to pronounce them.... or which one was on HH.   So we decided to back track and order a BOGO vodka and soda and lime.... that confused our t-totaller for a minute.   We placed out order 3 appetizers.    Our first round of drinks came quick.  Then nothing for about 15-20 minutes.  Which is painful when you are left with a bucket of salted peanuts.   Finally I was able to order a another round of drinks, vodka and peach tea.   Meanwhile we watched a everyone else get their main courses while we waited for our appetizers for another 10-15 minutes.  So we are now nearly 40 minutes since entering the place.   Finally our 3 appetizers arrived via other servers, again our waitress was gone elsewhere.   We ate our appetizers which were so-so nothing special and not worth the calories and fat.   We received our check and i had been charged for 2 teas, so we questioned this and the waitress said it was a mistake she would fix it.   We gave her 2 cards to split the bill... 25 minutes later we flagged down the manager who said he would get this resolved.   He promptly brought us a new check.  \"Hang on\" wheres our credit cards we gave over 25 minutes ago!!.   He went and found the waitress.  She presented us with a split bill finally but didn't take the tea off.   So I hunted for the manager and explained the mistake he said he would take care of it.     Now nearly 40 minutes had gone by and he presents me with one half of the bill and removed the $3 tea....?     Now I tried to explain that the folder I gave back to him had 2 slips in it to half the bill and he needed to redo the bill with the tea deducted....  The manager was clueless... finally brought us two checks but only one had the $3 removed... by this time we were so worn out and happy to see our cards back... it was 55 minutes since we handed them over that we paid, left a just tip for the service and left wondering what all the attraction was about.  No Appology no comps, Manager seemed pissed that I would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this Logan's and will discourage anybody else from going!  We had called three weeks ago to reserve a space to have my aunt's 63rd birthday party.  When we called, we got everything set up for Saturday, Nov 16 at 6pm for 20 people.  We called a week before the party to confirm and told them it turns out that we will have closer to 30 people attending.  They said this was fine and assured us there would be enough space.  We get there at 5:45pm to put table cloths down and set up a picture we wanted all the family & friends to sign.  We were told there were people sitting there and it wouldn't be available until 6pm.  Right before 6pm we asked if we would be able to get to our tables soon since everybody was there and we still needed to decorate before my aunt comes in at 6:15pm.  They said the people sitting at those tables knew they had to be finished by 6pm.  Well 6:15pm rolls around and we ask again.  At this time the guy/manager(?) tells us that when he originally talked to us that we were told there would not be guaranteed immediate seating.  This was not true.  We were never told this.  Had we been told this, we would have found somewhere else to go!  He said they only schedule parties and guarantee seating on Tuesday afternoons.  What?!  By this time he was grasping at straws trying to come up with excuses.  And what about the people sitting at those tables knowing they had be finished by 6pm?  They were still sitting there eating, so obviously this was a lie as well!  And who tells a paying customer that you have to be finished by a certain time because these tables are reserved for a party?  Why would someone still want to be seated there knowing they only had a limited amount of time to eat.  So we are all standing out in the lobby at 6:20pm waiting on our tables and my aunt comes in and we have to yell \"surprise\" as she walks through the door.  So much for planning this three weeks ago!  She has to use a walker and can't get around good and our tables are still not ready!  A few tables finally cleared out and they were able to seat 20 of us at 6:30pm.  There was 27 in our party!  The other table of people that supposedly knew they had to leave at 6pm finally left and we are all seated at 6:35 pm!  One of the waitresses was not happy to be there and made sure everybody knew it.  She was not very pleasant.  The 16 oz. rib-eyes were on sale for $16.49 which was the same price as the 12 oz rib-eyes.  Now I know why.  They were 60% fat!  Now I know rib-eyes are a fattier piece of meat, but if cooked correctly, a lot of that fat should melt away.  Mine should have been cooked to medium and it was rare.  Of course they took it back to cook it to temp and I just couldn't eat it.  The meat didn't taste good and it was so fatty that it was like mush.  So what should have been a wonderful time ended up being very stressful.  And through it all nobody ever apologized!  What happened to the customer always being right?  What happened to trying to please the customer?  Especially if they have 27 people ready to give you money?  Before we were all ready to leave I went to the bathroom.  The guy/manager we talked to earlier was standing back there and gave me a mean look as I walked by.  Why at that point would he not have at least smiled if he wasn't going to apologize or try to make it a pleasant evening for paying customers?  And of course our steaks didn't ring up at the special price.  I didn't realize this until the next day.  They rang up at the menu price even though I asked our unpleasant waitress about this before I placed my order.  I will NEVER go back to this Logan's restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Horrible..sat at the bar we ordered app sampler. The only thing on the plate that was good was the celery sticks. I could of bought frozen boxed apps frome the store and been way more happier. Bland, not cooked well crap food.  If your into free peanuts there are other way better choices out there."}
{"text":"Gotta give this place the stars it deserves...5...  1) Staff was amazing, fun, & friendly from the minute you walk in till you leave..awesome.. 2) Loved the atmosphere, relaxed, fun, great music and just all around cool place. 3) Loved loved loved that fresh baked rolls of the table OMG.. had some to go too. wow.. 4) Lots of good choices on the menu (we went for lunch) prices are just right. 5) Food came, was amazing, you get Quality and Quantity for your money..Cant find that in many places at all. Normally one of my biggest complaints, but \"not\" here.. 6) I actually like the peanuts on the floor. To me it represents relax, have fun, & good food.  Anyone who commented on that negatively is a stick in mud and don't take their review seriously as they are super biased.. dumbasses.."}
{"text":"The steak was grizzly for a New York strip. Had to ask for silver ware & napkins. They did take the tough steak off the bill. Service was only fair."}
{"text":"Came to Logan's today for the first time to burn some time. Sat at the bar to have a drink and order some appetizers. I ordered the Roadhouse trio which was not just a good value but the food itself was really good. The bartender Jennifer was a very sweet woman. Courteous and professional. She was very tentative to my needs as a customer. The best service I've had by anyone at any of the restaurants in the area. I will definitely be coming back and recommending this location to my friends and family. Thanks Jennifer for the service"}
{"text":"Do not go to this place. This was my first time going to this place and will be the last. The waiter did not refill our drinks once or even ask and he took our order and never checked back in with the table. The order took at least 40 minutes for 2 medium well steaks and potato sides. Then the food finally arrives and he tells the other person at the table that they ran out of baked potatoes. He should have mentioned that long before the 40 min wait. We had a one yr old baby at the table and didn't have time or patience to wait for another side so we asked him to just remove the potato from the bill and he said no. I had to get a manager to intervene and he didn't seem to care much either and took 5 dollars off the bill. Not to mention my mashed potatoes were cold when they arrived and the steaks were rubbery and overdone. There is a Texas Roadhouse opening  across the road...save your money for them. They are better quality and less expensive than Logans and everything is way better."}
{"text":"Had a decent experience at logan's roadhouse. Service was decent, food was average, and I had the prickley pear margarita which was good. Overall i would recommend this place only if you are driving by and need a quick sit down steakhouse or if you just want to try a new steakhouse from the normal large chain steakhouses."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Me and my grandfather went for lunch on a Monday and both had large meals with salads for $15. Very good deal. The bread is worth the visit by itself."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday night. Wasn't entirely full, but still had a 15 minute wait. Sarah was our server and did an excellent job. Waited a few minutes for the bread to come out and had to remind her to bring it. No probs. Appetizer was good. Salads came out timely. Food came out and I was missing the sauce for the shrimp appetizer. but got some cocktail sauce instead. Food was OK. Bread was OK. Not sure if this place is on a \"gotta go back soon!\" place, but it was fine. Portions were good. Price was on par. Sarah was good."}
{"text":"Just ok noyhing special here. Stay away from the shrimp dry and nasty. The bread is the best part."}
{"text":"We had a dinner date here with some good friends of ours. Typical roadhouse where you throw the peanut shells on the floor.  Waitress was named Bambi.  She was kind and tended to us just as needed which was awesome.  5 stars for that part.  They have a 2 for $15.99.  Which is pretty economical for a roadhouse.  We had the tenders and the steak meal.  Tenders were good.  Steak was nothing to write home about.  Although cooked medium as requested, it was very dry and didn't even leave any juices on the plate. I don't see us coming back since they didn't leave a lasting impression.  No stars for the steak."}
{"text":"I can only give them 1 star and is is because we left after sitting un-noticed for 15 minutes. No hello. No drink order. No service. And it was not busy...we were sat immediately.  15 minutes is not that long but wait for even a \"I'll be right with you.\" would have been appropriate.  Told manager we were leaving because of their service and he seemed he couldn't care less. Funny how the other 4 restaurants next door all have waits but they don't...wonder why??? Too many choices and restaurants can't really afford to just have families of five leave. Too bad for them. Only 4% dissatisfied customers speak out. 96% go away quietly and 91% never come back."}
{"text":"I went here a few times about a year ago and loved it. We were in the area and decided to come again. It was again a great experience. While the food and pricing is good, I have to rave about the service. Truly good service is so very hard to find. I'm very impressed.   Our waitress was Candy. She was so friendly and most helpful with the menu. She made us laugh and was attentive to our table. Even the team walking by was friendly, attentive and smiles. Great team of people there!  Despite the drive, we will for sure come again."}
{"text":"It is what it is. A chain family steak house, not Mortons. Of course the price isn't Mortons either. Good attentive service with ok food."}
{"text":"So-so chain place. Salad was decent but everyone in my party was not too excited about their steaks. Average."}
{"text":"good (for two) food special and drink specials. good for a casual night out."}
{"text":"I had never been to Logan's before but went with a group of eleven people. I'm giving them two stars only because they were so accommodating and the manager was top notch. Otherwise, the story goes south.  Our waitress brought us drinks and that seemed to be the only thing she was really capable of doing. I know it was noisy, but she couldn't seem to hear anything we said and we had to repeat all of our orders repeatedly.  I ordered a Pepper jack Cheeseburger that comes with onion straws, so I asked for \"No Onions\", and a sweet potato. My husband had the meatloaf with broccoli and sweet apples. The waitress took our order and then refilled our drinks.  She delivered our food, and we didn't see her again until she presented the bill.  We had to ask other people going by for more silverware, for enough bread and butter for the \"whole\" table and when we were done eating we snagged someone else to carry away some of the plates. Never did she come by to see if our food was prepared correctly, and NO mine was not good.  My Medium Well Burger started out with a huge pile of onions...didn't I order without onions?  In peeling them off it took most of the cheese, which was distinctly NOT pepper jack cheese.  I cut the burger in half, and hmmmm Medium Well should NOT be deep pink inside, and when I ordered I specifically said NO PINK which she repeated back to me. My sweet potato was really good, but was so burnt that I could only eat about half of it without getting the charred skin, so was very disappointing, and it was really small.  The lady next to me had one that was easily 3 times as big as mine, and she got two sides, I only got one side because I got a burger.  My husband had the meatloaf, which he said was very flavorful and he enjoyed it, but it was hard to eat because it fell apart when he cut into it, and without a spoon it was a bit hard to eat.   The manager came to the table when our meals were mostly finished, thank god for bread because my meal consisted of the part of the hamburger that wasn't pink and half of a small sweet potato. He asked how things were and I guess he could tell by my face that I wasn't happy because he stepped right up and offered to have a new meal prepared, which I declined as everyone was already done eating, but he comped my meal which did make me happy.  I will go back and try them again, because I realize that one meal does not mean they are bad, and everyone else seemed to enjoy what they had to eat."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was nice, however waiting for our table to be called we were passed over numerous times. I won't be going back here again"}
{"text":"We always love Logan's Roadhouse!! Our waitress was Alyson and she was great on a busy night.  My wife loves the Grateful Dead drink in the bar.  The bar staff is always great!! The food always delivers and we all love it, young and old! I do wish that they would get some TV's up for the games.  To nice of a place to have to hunt a TV!!"}
{"text":"James, you were very helpful and your attitude made our dining experience fun!  It goes against reason to order salmon from a steakhouse, however, I was pleasantly surprised when I did order the salmon due to dietary restrictions. It was one of the most flavorful and well prepared pieces of salmon that I have had, and I frequent fish houses regularly.  The order was accurate timely and overall tasted great. We had zero wait time however it was after lunch time that we got here.   I look forward to future meals at Logan's Roadhouse!  Again, thank you James for your professional service and fun interaction with our children."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. We are from California and we loved this place!! Our server was a nice gentleman, he greeted us, checked on us and made sure we were good. The fried pickles were delicious and definitely our second favorite place for fried pickles. The other servers and hostess were also quite nice and wonderful service. We will definitely be back when we come to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Only had to wait 20 minutes which was great for a Saturday night. We haven't been here in a while, so we were excited because of course we love the bread. It's literally the BEST. If you've never been before you will love the bread. Sadly the service was horribleeeeee. We got our bread AFTER we got our food. Our entrees came out within minutes after getting our salads, and my friend ordered an appetizer and it never came. We didn't get refills on our drinks until the end of our meal. When you're a server your tips are your paycheck. I was a server for years, so I always leave 20% or more... but this was extremely unacceptable. Will come back, but wish the service was better. Hopefully next time it will be!"}
{"text":"This could have been a 4 or 5 star review. The food was delicious, our waitress was awesome and the manager was really nice and checked on us to see how we are doing. When we left the restaurant our whole group immediately smelled marijuana. When we turned to go to our car, I see there is a man in a truck parked next to our car smoking a joint so we decide to wait by our friends car because I didn't want my 8 month old daughter near it. We see the guy get out and throw the joint on the ground and light up a cigarette and walk towards the restaurant. It was an employee that worked there! I waited another 20 minutes and our entire car still smelled like pot when we were getting in. It was disgusting and it grossed me out thinking about that guy having anything to do with my food."}
{"text":"The $4 off $20 is not valid in NC, SC, GA...it should not be advertised on this site based on my location.   The food here was great & I cleaned my plate! I had the filet. The broccoli here is awesome! Great bartenders that took good care of us. Not our first trip & won't be our last."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Environment was similar to Johnson big apple.   It's got a yuppie cowboy casual vibe.  I didn't smell any fabulous BBQ meat  to get me crazy hungry for anything.  Looked at the menu and there wasn't too much of choices for food but did have a lot of drinks to choose from.  There happy hour seemed pretty cheap also.  Meals where expensive for their steaks, I choose a slider plate cause I wasn't in the mood to put down twenty five bucks for a steak.  My sliders were 9 bucks cause they charge you extra to substitute fries for their potato chips.  Wait staff was attentive and friendly.  If I came back I'd only come for the drinks."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner on a Saturday night. We got here at 9, Logans closes at 11. We were rushed out of here from the second we sat down until we left. We were given the bill with our food. The food was bad- steak was inedible, fries were greasy, everything seemed old. The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because the whiskey BBQ ribs were the saving grace."}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner for somewhere we have never tried before. Nice big parking lot ,lots of room. The place was semi busy for a Thursday night.  We asked for a booth, which we got in the bar area. We had enough time to fully read the menu before our server came to the table. Buckets of Peanuts adorn all the tables and you eat the peanuts and throw the shells on the floor. Which my girlfriend felt bad doing , but that is what everyone does here they tell us.  So we ordered our drinks, along with water. All came quickly, then ordered our food. A runner brought out the food.  I had gotten the Sirloin ,my girl got the Filet mingon. Both were cooked perfectly,that is an A t. However the runner said, we are out of Baked Potaoes. What would you like instead?   How do you run out of Baked Potatoes at 6:45pm when you are a Steak house???? Anyway after that we ordered the Sweet Potaoes, They came out shortly after, and it was all good. I think it is very high priced for a low end place. Plastic glasses and a very rough look in the place. They may be going for Rustic looking, but all I see is a cheaply made room. It is an odd vibe here, can't quite put my finger on it. But, service was slow ,our server seemed as if she had too many tables and was stressed out.  So I do not blame her.  We won't return, too many good choices out there for the $$. Also the restrooms were dirty and not kept up."}
{"text":"Came here with friends who was in town for a short visit. She said she wanted steak and since we were in the neighborhood, stopped in. She ordered steak and lobster and wasn't as hungry so I ordered 3 pork sandwich. She loved hers and I loved mine. Just in case you haven't heard of it, they begin bringing us fresh cooked bread, soft butter. The bread alone is worth the trip. No bread is better. This place has great service, casual atmosphere, huge. Just a great date place, or friends meeting place or whatever. Try them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went there a few months ago. Wanted to try them. Everything seemed okay at first!! We where seated promptly. We ordered our drinks and appetizer!! Upon getting our appetizer, we placed our dinner order. Not more then 10 minutes later we received our order ( no prob.) I kid you not, but my husband had just cut his steak and was about to devour it!!! WHEN the waitress came with our check!!! My husband almost passed out. That is something he will and can not tolerate. Him being in the restaurant industry is a big NO!!! NO!!! Therefore I don't think we will ever return and I really didn't like the food anyway!!"}
{"text":"I went here 3 years ago and was excited going but left in a hurry. We got there and was escorted to our table. After we sat down at the table the waiter asked us if we have ever been there before and I told him it was my first time, he interrupted me and said, \" yea, I got it, I got it and put his hand in a stopping gesture. I was like wow then why bring it up and then the service was very poor and he hardly ever showed up to our table so we left happily ever after without getting anything."}
{"text":"Logan's is OK in my book. Everything is just so-so but it's cheap! My sister wanted to go to dinner last night and suggested Logan's because on Tuesdays they have a 2 meal special for about $14. and I think kids meals are cheap on Tuesday as well. The food was decent, nothing really amazing, just regular but enjoyable. The service is great, they are all really awesome."}
{"text":"My sister, mom, and I love it here but nowhere near as much as we love our server Patti! The food is really good but with a server like her makes this place really enjoyable! She makes our experience here so much fun and for the most part she's why we keep coming back! I believe she is one of the original servers at this location and she just plain rocks! Great attitude and personable! When you go in, ask for her, she'll make your experience here that much better! I'm vegetarian and love the trio app with potato skins, mushrooms, and crispy fried pickles! Also that potato soup is soooo yummy My sister and mom love the shrimp and steak skewers!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by management because of my previous review. The manager was very nice and assured me that the problem with the Miller Lite tap has been remedied. He was apologetic about how the manager had responded to the issue. We gave Logans another chance and had a great meal, drinks,  and an overall nice time."}
{"text":"My husband and i went as a treat and enjoyed our food paid with our debit. It was pending and never posted so we ignored it. Well, today, a month later we get charged. Unacceptable. Its a good thing we had the money in our account or a $35 dinner would've been a $70 dinner. We will never return and I will make sure everyone I know in the Concord and Kannapolis area knows."}
{"text":"First time coming here. It was delicious! They have fresh bread rolls with butter, so good! This place is so much better then Texas road house I believe.   They have a bar in the middle and they also have tvs.  They have specials from 3-6 everyday & they also have happy hour every day from 3pm-6pm. On Wednesdays kids eat free. On Thursday they have $10 burgers.   The fresh bread rolls were so good & so hot! The butter melted on the bread & oh it was so soft. I ordered the combo plate with 6oz sirloin & Logan's wood grill chicken & I got to pick 2 sides so I got mash potatoes & broccoli. I'm surprised the grill chicken came with some rice as well. They give you so much food.   Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Order the Prime Rib Sandwich with fries expecting a sandwich with Prime Rib...silly me. Meat was gray,  LESS than 1/4 thick and 1/2 of the sandwich was uneatable due to the fat lacing the meat.  Fries were semi-cold and hard."}
{"text":"Good for comfort food. Large portions so we have plenty of leftovers.  Sevice was ok, she seemed a disinterested/annoyed.   As for the food - both chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak were fresh and hot. We appreciated the meat free white gravy. Mashed potatoes were good. Salads fresh and plentiful. Rolls were good.   If we were in a comfort food mode, we would come back but we'd hope for a different waitress."}
{"text":"Me and my sister went here for the first time and we both liked it the 2 full meals for 14.99 is a good deal you get plenty of food   The service was outstanding we will be back"}
{"text":"Another business lunch but to go this time. I sure wish they had online ordering. I didn't want to risk mistakes ordering six lunches over the phone, so I came in, ordered and then waited 25 minutes.   In all, we ordered three Steak and Rib Combos, one Roadhouse Salad with Grilled Chicken and two Kicking Chicken Salads. Each came with a side and the combos came with side salads.   The host was patient with me as I ordered but it was rather slow anyway.   As far as accuracy, the order was spot on. Thank you for that!  For food quality, since I'd been to TRB several times, I knew what to expect. They excel at BBQ, are pretty good with burgers and sides but so-so with the odd stuff that is non BBQ, like signature salads.   Please get an online ordering system!  I told my guys at work that they can't order from here anymore, since it's such a pain."}
{"text":"Drinks are VERY good. Rolls are good. Can't say the same about the food. Food wasn't good. I'd rather drive to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"My GF and I come here on occasion for a quick lunch.  This is not one of our favorite spots to eat at, but it is convenient and comfortable.  This past Sunday, I was out by myself since my home was overtaken by a bunch of women having a baby shower for my GF's daughter.  No big deal -- I had errands to run, took the dogs to get groomed, and decided to have a few beers and some lunch by myself.  I get there around 3:15 pm and I know this is an off-peak time.  I wait 10 minutes before I am even acknowledged and seated.  I sit at the bar since I thought that would be convenient, but that probably was a mistake since the bartender was missing and very slow to serve me.  They have no craft beer on tap and only a few bottled ones...sort of funny to me being that this is supposed to be a \"roadhouse\".  Since it is happy hour I look at the happy hour menu and see nothing that excites me.  I decided I want a corned beef or pastrami sandwich and look for that on the menu.  Nope-they have no such sandwiches.  So I decide to order a big dinner and take some of it home for my dogs to snack on after I pick them up from the groomers.  So I get some kind of \"trio\" dinner -- a small sirloin steak, two skewers of grilled shrimp, and about a half dozen of fried shrimps.  The fried shrimps come with some kind of bourbon BBQ sauce -- pretty icky stuff; would have been better with plain tartar sauce.  The rice is pretty crappy but the steamed broccoli is OK.  I take the two grilled shrimp skewers and the steak home to my dogs......they enjoy it!  Especially my white bichon who thinks she is a cat and loves seafood.  All-in-all an \"average at best\" meal, but a little disappointing for a nice roadhouse like this --- they gotta revise their menu with more appealing food; add better beers to their selections, especially \"on tap\"; and their service needs to be improved.  The manager needs to whip those servers into shape since for the whole lot of them (maybe about 8 at this hour) their speed and efficiency is certainly lacking."}
{"text":"Enjoying the 2 for $15.99 dinners. Perfectly cooked Salmon and steamed broccoli. House salad good, hot rolls and butter included. Really good meal And fast service."}
{"text":"Went with friends who eat there quite frequently (enough to request a certain server who knew their names and drink orders!). Service was fast and attentive and our food was delicious (and there was tons of it!). Ask for warm rolls with cinnamon butter...yum!!!"}
{"text":"Place is so so my first trip to one at another location was really good and then we came to this one. I really don't care for the rolls and plain butter but they are edible I am just spoiled from another steak house. It had good service but I always go when its usually later and not as busy. Ppl need to never complain about mac and cheese just go home and make it it's simple and a crap food in general. OK..."}
{"text":"I really wish I could review the food but we never got around to eating any of it. My friend and I went here after a movie at about 415 in the afternoon and it was not busy there was no wait at all yet they were seating people who came in after us making us stand there and wait and wait and wait giving us some excuse about lack of staff. But they could seat everyone else that came in after us. So based on basically very poor customer service one star"}
{"text":"I ate at Logan's for the first time last night and just wanted to say it is affordable, delicious and it just became one of my favorite places to eat.  It is very similar to Texas Roadhouse which is great because I love that place as well.  The only thing I dislike at both restaurants is the noise level...I suppose because they are called a road house they assume we all want to hear shrill screaming for every guest who has a birthday...unfortunately for those of us not having a birthday it is just obnoxious and annoying... (Someone I know told me they wouldn't be back because of the yelling).  I guess I won't complain though because at least they don't play loud obnoxious music (like Applebees sometimes does)...where you have to yell at your dinner mate to have a conversation.  The food, prices and service are good enough I will just plug my ears when the screaming starts..."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the third time I celebrated my carnivorous side with this lovely steakhouse.    It's your normal steakhouse as far as decor goes... peanut debris on the floor... wooden decor... kinda dark.  The thing about Logan's is that it's MASSIVE.  I've never attempted to try and find the bathroom because I know I'll get lost.  Cool part is, there hasn't been a wait to get in at all... as soon as we walk in, we get seated.  The menu is good... love the top selections of meat.  It's been hit or miss with my New York Strip that I always get.  Yesterday, that piece of meat was the best thing I've had for YEARS.  So nice... didn't have to trim it or deal with tendons in the middle of the meat or anything... it was beautiful.  We also had their artichoke and spinach dip... it's ok. Standard, nothing to write home about except that it's pretty salty.  Service has always been great every time.  The servers are down to earth and they will joke around and hang out if you are open to it."}
{"text":"I use to go to Logan's in Tennessee when I was in the army. I'd normally get so sloshed it didn't matter what the food tasted like, but now the chain has been in AZ for a while and I no longer drink. This place has good rolls and sweet tea. That's it. Don't expect much here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty marginal. My wife had an \"Everything\" salad. I ordered a 16 oz Ribeye. Ribeye are usually well marbled so they're tender. This one was as tough as shoe leather. It was horrible. . We were here on a Wednesday night at 6:30.pm. Is estimate the restaurant was 30-40% full. We were after the dinner rush in Mesa AZ!  Service was awful. It took 40 minutes just to get to salads. At the 40 minute mark, I complained and was told I was next in line. You have better choices for steak."}
{"text":"So have driven by this place many times and finally decided to try it. I was very disappointed sadly. I waited quite awhile for the food to come out , too long IMHO. When it did I got the Sirloin and shrimp dish with a baked potato. All of my food my cold , as if it was left out the entire time I waited for the food.  The potato was so cold the butter wouldn't melt or spread. The shrimp was cold and I was afraid to even try it. The steak was also cold and was the only thing I actually tried and it was chewy at best. The manager was very nice and apologized however the server, although seemed like a nice kid, made excuses. The manager took care of it but We will not be back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Logan's. My husband decided to take me there for a celebration. As soon as we got there we were sirens and our waiter came to take our drinks order. He also brought a bucket of salted peanuts that were really good. I decided to go with steak and salted mushrooms, and he went with steak and loaded potato. We both also had salads, He had cessar and I had the house salad that was simply amazing! I always order my steak medium, but this time decided to risk on a medium rare. Our food didn't take long to come and everything was cooked as per order. I was really impressed with my steak. Our waiter was nice, but got missing sometimes, the food came fast and was good but nothing outstanding.  Price wise I would say that it average for a steakhouse. I probably won't be dying to go back any time soon, but also won't be against it in case someone invite me to go there."}
{"text":"If I could have given this restaurant negative stars I would. First off the star I did give it goes to the excellent service they offer at this location. The hostess and server were friendly and attentive. My good experience stops there. I ordered a filet, baked sweet potato and a salad without croutons. The salad came WITH the croutons; no big deal, it happens. I just picked them off and the waiter apologized. The steak came. It was cooked perfectly. But then I took my first bite and came as close as I've ever been to spitting out my food at a restaurant. The meat was spoiled. It smelled bad and tasted even worse (I didn't smell it until after I tasted it...I mean who would think of doing that?). I mean AWFUL...it took the rest of the evening to get that horrible taste to dissipate. The baked potato was cooked to within an inch of its life. I asked for cinnamon and sugar on the side. It came with only the cinnamon. Then I was told twice the manager (I believe her name was Amy although I'm not sure) would be by. She never came. Are you kidding me? You serve spoiled food to a customer and the manager is too busy to even talk to you?! Then the server tells me they are going to \"comp\" my meal. Comp it? I think you get a comp meal when you actually eat it. This would actually be a no-charge meal. While they did offer to recook a new piece of steak I'm thinking to myself 1) they didn't even know the meat I had was bad, how can they tell if they serve me another piece? And 2) do I want my meat cooked on the same heat source as a bad piece of meat? Uh...no!  I'm never going back there. I have had issues before with the food quality (e.g. meat too tough) but never spoiled food. A free meal wouldn't even entice me to go back there ever again."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good but lately the service has gone all down hill and every time I walk out I feel like I just wasted all my money on an over priced below average meal with incompetent staff or staff that just plain doesn't care about their job. That the make it a horrible experience. Never could king back here again."}
{"text":"Came in before the lunch crowd. No one there but maybe 2 other table of people. Waited and waited to be seated. 5 minutes later still waiting and the waitresses were walking right past us. Finally seated. No menu, nothing just walked off, no one came to get our drink order. Waited again. After another 10 minutes we walked out. Spoke to the manager on the way out said we will eat some where else. I understand if they were busy but there wasn't anyone there yet."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary. Our server Josh was awesome (personality wise). The quality of the food was \"OK\". The shrooms appetizer was too salty. They offer bread and butter. Idk about coming back here again."}
{"text":"my husband and i have gone here several times and either the steaks are not cooked right or service is horrible. last time we went we were about 15th on the waiting list with 4 tables available in the bar. I asked if they are going to seat those tables and were told no one wanted the bar, i told they we would take one there, I was told we had to wait until our name was called because we had to wait our turn even though no one wanted them. After 1/2 hr. we left and went to famous daves thank goodness they really like their customers. I wrote the corp. office only to be lied to. I was called by a manager in tenn. and told that doug the district manager would call me in which he never did and that was a month ago. I was also told they were sending us out a gift card in hopes we would return hahaha nope.. why would anyone give logans roadhouse a dime when even the corp office could care less about their customers.. pls go somewhere else. daves, charlestons, texas roadhouse, waldos in mesa... Pls to not give logans a dime...  Since i have written this Doug the district manager called and said he is going to make good and this is not how Logans is to run their stores.. so time will tell"}
{"text":"I was hesitent to eat here based on neg reveiws. But my wife and i decided to try it tonight. Let me tell you we are so glad that we did. I got their teriyaki steak with a side of shrimp. My wife got a steak and chicken. Amazing is all i can say. The server even asked is to cut into our steak to make sure they were cooked correctly.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.  The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.  The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well.   The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start."}
{"text":"My husband and I were first time diners this evening. We enjoyed the buckets are peanuts, tossing the shells on the floor, and even the loud music--as it was the perfect atmosphere for loud music.   My bowl of potato soup was delicious and the serving was just the right amount of food.  The yeast rolls went perfect with the soup.  While my husband enjoyed himself, he said, \"they will have to do better with their mushroom and cheese burgers -- Red Robins (next door) has a better burger.\"  Rest rooms we clean, prices were reasonable and we will return--it's fun to eat peanuts and not have to worry about the mess the shells are making."}
{"text":"My kids love this place.  My husband enjoyed his food as well.  As the only vegetarian in my family I was surpised by how many options I had on the menu.  The prices are unbeatable and the little dessert cups are the perfect size.  I thought the cheesecake one was the best."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.    Food is always good, service is always good, and the Roadhouse Cherry Limeade is ALWAYS good.  Easy for datenight of for family night with a rambunctious 4 year old."}
{"text":"F O O D   S U C K S  VERY DISAPPOINTED with this place, first and last time here, food was cold, steak was dry, lemonade must of had a pound of sugar, service was horrible, waited 35 min for our food when place wasn't busy at all, peanuts were stayled, got a bucket of peanuts from 4 other tables, all of them were all the same, and my crackers that came with my chili were stayled, NEVER WILL I STEP FOOT AGAIN AT LOGANS,  TEXAS ROADHOUSE BLOWS U GUYS OUT OF THE WATER."}
{"text":"Hubby-  We check out Bass Pro Shops frequently and generally go to Famous Daves which we should of, but for some reason did not.  Anyway, 4:15pm we decide to try Logan's.  Looked like a happening place by parking lot.  Got inside and place was about 15% full.  We were immediately greeted by a hostess and was shown to a table, at this point my wife kindly asked if we could get a booth which was 14' away from the table.  This caused major stress as the hostess had to \"go find out\" if we could sit at a booth.  2 other Employees huddled with the hostess and were whispering like this was a life and death situation.  We were like, seriously, sorry we asked and were fine to take table and just get our food.  We sat down and got menus and then noticed the employees that were doing nothing just looking at us.  At this point I'm thinking to myself what's up with this place.  So I get on Yelp and find out it's par for the course at this place.  We waited a bit and walked out.  Nobody was mad, upset, asked why we were leaving....nothing.  I can clearly see why this place is going out of business.  Go to Famous Dave's if you are in this area and were wanting to go to Logans.  I'm glad we didn't stick around and order their frozen and packaged meals."}
{"text":"This was our go to place for the family, everyone could get the food the wanted and no one was unhappy. Until last night, we found out our favorite Server was gone, and that should have been a sign. I think they changed managers or something.  The place was not busy and there was plenty of staff. The waitress argued with us about what was on the Adult Beverage menu. Once we had placed our orders, we waited, three salads should not have taken that long. We had to wait again for the rest of our food which was our disappointment. Overcooked Fried Chicken, Steak not Done to order with over fried potatoes, frozen butter on the  Baked Potatoes and not enough of it, with weirdly seasoned Salmon.   The music in the restrooms was turned up so loud you can barely stay in there long enough to wash your hands.  Sadly we are now in search of another place."}
{"text":"We went to logans for a family  birthday dinner. We had a large group and our waiter was great. Everyone's food was right and the food is ok. Not bad for a chain restaurant. I got The Everything grilled chicken salad. I'm not sure why most chain restaurants end up making the salad choices just as unhealthy as other options. My salad could have used less cranberries & blue cheese and more veggies. It did have a good portion of chicken. I know at you are thinking... Why did you go to a steak place and get a salad? I don't eat steak often. So sorry I can't give any feedback on steaks."}
{"text":"Wow. This used to be a fairly good place for dinner. Upon arriving to the hostess stand, it was obvious we interrupted some earth-moving 20-something scandal between three girls. Finally, a snobby one huffed and took us to our table.  The menu makes it appear that you are going to get a full meal and even comes with salad and/or two sides. Not so. The size of the plates have shrunk and the portions have done so as well. We were all still hungry after dropping $80.00 on dinner. I think we were taken!   My chicken breast was tiny and the mac n cheese was horrible. The peppercorn sauce I asked to be on the side was cold. My son's steak tips were too tough to eat. Not worth our time, really. The only good thing was the complimentary yeast roll. Dessert was the mini desserts and the brownie was hard and inedible.  Not impressed and not in any hurry to go back. Too bad. It was a fun place."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to the 25th Ave and happy valley location two weeks ago.  We waited 25 min after being seated and never had any service for even water.  All while, as we were seated near front counter and entrance, there were 6 employees  standing around laughing and joking and not doing a damned thing at all. We finally had lost patience with this situation and were leaving. I said to the group around the kiosk that it was very upsetting that they're doing nothing while we sit unattended and the few servers apparent couldn't get to us for being so busy., and that they could have at least helped with water or something.  One of them told me he wasn't even on shift,  another two others said that wasn't their job,  another said they would get the manager and left, never to return before I left. Another one said I had no right to \"yell \" at them, even though I was using a normal speaking voice.  Another girl actually flipped me the finger as I was leaving.  What a horrible establishment.  They totally ruined our one night out we can have each month.  If I did ANYTHING close to what they did, I would be fired so fast my head wouldn't stop spinning around on my neck for a week.  NEVER WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS ESTABLISHMENT."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff.  No reservations cause they don't take them so we waited more the 35 min.  The manager noticed & provided us with a free appetizer.  Good recovery!  Steaks were the bomb!  Our waitress was outstanding!  Will be back for sure!  Prices were very reasonable!  Lots of TV's for football & bar seemed to be busy & fun!  This is a most stop & eat place!"}
{"text":"This place was listed very high on my roadhouse list but this has dropped to the BOTTOM for one huge reason. begin story....  It was a late friday, about 40 mins before closing time (11:20) my daughter was getting more and more tired by the minute and ended up passing out in my lap which sped up our exit, when the check came I paid with my debit card and I ended up leaving my card in the case they bring in the table. I didnt figure this out until a day later cause I didnt use the card but when I jumped on my chase app on my phone I saw that my card had been used at 3 gas stations within 2 miles of the place of business. I know it was the employee who took my card for a fact cause after I signed it she was already at the table collecting it. I called the manager as soon as I knew what happened he seemed concerned but that is all. I will no longer ever visit this location based only on this experience if you cant trust them not to turn in your card how can you trust them not to write down your information once you give it to them. I have turned in wallets, phones, and lost items I find at gyms all the time so I am only expecting them to do what I would have done. Shame on you!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, however the food tastes like something microwaved.  The place is also dirty; peanut shells everywhere... I would not come back here.  Tried out Long Horn several days later, and it was much better than Logan's."}
{"text":"Logan's has the best beef brisket of any BBQ Chain. Corn on the cob is great but it is the Jalapeno Mac & Cheese that brings me back over and over and over"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and they have never gotten my order right. I have never actually had something there that was cooked the way I ordered it. They even forgot the salad I ordered one time until the waitress brought the check. The last time I went my husband and I both got sick off the food. The atmosphere is fun, but that's about all it has going for it."}
{"text":"I usually don't review chain establishments unless a service encounter blows my mind...this time around it was the service at the bar. Which was \"turrible\" as Charles Barkley would put it. I arrived around 10pm, an hour before they closed and you would have thought I had arrived at 10:59PM for an 11:00PM closing. The bartender was visibly annoyed that I was there and became increasingly annoyed with each of my requests, which were mainly requests for another beer.   Overall, the food was exactly what you expect of this place...decent. The service though was terrible. I felt like a huge bother and an annoyance.  Usually the bar of a place is inviting and full of the most energetic employees...not at this place. I'm simply passing through, but I'll make sure to never stop here on my next go-round."}
{"text":"Not impressive thus far. Steak was overlooked. Ordered a replacement steak for wife. Took longer then we expected. Ribs were overdone. Hard to chew. I'll end up giving the other half rack to the dog. Fries were better at McDonald's.   Staff is friendly enough. Price was average. Should have gone to the other BBQ place but after driving from Sedona we were both too hungry to drive another 10 miles for BBQ."}
{"text":"May just be the best steak I've ever had, and I've been all over the world.  The rest of the meal was great too.  The service is what ultimately earned the 5 stars!  Friendly, upbeat and attentive without being smothering."}
{"text":"Super steak, awesome mash paaaataaaataaas!  Service was fast & good. Super eats after a busy work day!! Ty Melissa."}
{"text":"Went to Logan's on a Friday at 1230 PM for lunch. First low rating 93. Not very busy lot of dirty tables had to wait. Sat us at the wait station.  Bread very good and hot and fresh. Steak over cooked ordered medium got it well done. Ran out of beverage. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Asked who owned the property neither the host nor hostess knew nothing about the company. The server was rude and argued with us the whole time. He never offered any suggestions, was just another order taker. Everything came out one at a time and everything came out wrong. My tequila had no the lime. The rolls were weird, like they've been microwaved. Even after speaking the manager, nothing changed. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Discovered that their Caesar salad is pretty dang good and the Logans Tea's are a great value for if you wanna get knocked on your ass. Made with Everclear and several other liquors, I was told that they can only serve you two before you are cut off. I had the blue one and it was really good although i did order it sans the Everclear."}
{"text":"Been to this place exactly once and that's probably enough for me.  Nice place, good staff, mediocre Chilis/Applebee's like food.  Had shrimp, chicken, and some sides.   The rolls and apples were pretty great, but everything else was brined to death and tasted like a frozen TV dinner."}
{"text":"We had the worst service ever here. I took my wife here for a much needed date night. (That we are really able to take) I wish we would have saved our money and stayed home or at least went somewhere that gas customer service.  Our service sucked it was so slow took for ever to even take our drink order then took over 10 minutes to bring 2 sodas to our table. Then took forever to place dinner. They brought someone else order to our table first people behind us. Then picked it up off our table and gave it to them but they refused it asking it to be remade. There \"server told them they didn't touch it and it will take them time to remake it.\" I was laughing because I would not want it either. It was taken bsck. Our food took a very long time time come out and when it did it was barely warm. Drinks getting refiled was like trying to win the lottery lol. Asked for manger but no one ever came"}
{"text":"I came into Logan's for a couple drinks, and the bartender Mack was stellar, and smoking hot!"}
{"text":"We had really excellent dinners at Logan's tonight, and the price was just as good as the steajs. If we lived in the Phoenix area, this restaurant would be a frequent choice for us!"}
{"text":"The place isn't terrible. Fair at best. food is fair, service is fair. Prices  are the same as other local steakhouses that are near by. been here several times. The place doesn't wow you. probably wont ever go back unless im starving to death. There is never a wait here, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday on 7/26/16 with my family, most of the meals were okay but bland.  I got the pulled pork, it was the worst I ever had.  A hard clump of dry meat."}
{"text":"We started with the mushroom appetizer - deep fried and dipping sauce is horseradish flavored - very delicious!  I had the grilled salmon with sweet potato and broccoli - all perfectly prepared - my date had the talapia - for dessert we had the brownie and ice cream which was enough for at least 4 people!  All this food for $19.99 M thru W.  Our server was excellent also. A fantastic deal and the food is excellent.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I checked out Logan's Roadhouse a couple of weeks ago for lunch. I picked up a buddy from Sky Harbor and this place popped into my head. We had a late 2 ish lunch so the place was not busy.  Our service was excellent, the soda refills kept us happy. But not as happy as those dinner rolls. My dinning companion had never been to a Logan's before, now he can strike one more thing off of his bucket list. I mean, aren't those dinner rolls to die for?  I had the pork chop along with the sweet potato fries. And let me tell ya, the pork chop was cooked to perfection, very juicy. And how can you go wrong with the cinnamon and butter in your sweet potato. I also had the perfectly cooked broccoli to balance out the meal.  And of course the perfect ending to a perfect meal was when my buddy pulled out his wallet to pick up the tab. It must have been the dinner rolls!"}
{"text":"I've been to Logan's Roadhouse several times in several different states. This is the place I go to when I need a steak in a casual atmosphere where I can drink beer from a bottle without any strange looks from other patrons.  I took the family to Logan's on Sunday since I had the jones for that yummy bread they serve (you can always ask for more servings of bread), plus I needed a steak. I usually order their Prime Rib which is fabulous, but decided to go with a sirloin steak this time around. The steak wasn't the greatest, but I enjoyed the sweet potatoes and brocoli (hint - tell the waiter not to boil the life out of the brocoli). My kids enjoyed the chicken strips, mac & cheese and meatloaf and mashed potatoes. They inhaled that food so quickly I didn't even get a taste. My wife had a shrimp dish with her signature strawberry lemonade (good but Blue 32 Grill does it much better). You will usually spend about $17/$18 dollars a head at Logan's for dinner."}
{"text":"Classy as a Lap Dancer leaving a skid mark on a man's lap that is a indication of the way they cook filet's of beef here here . (crap on your plate)  Remember the Movie Logan's Run where they killed everyone that reached 30 years old well I am over 30 but I felt like dying after trying my meal we've been here years ago but thought maybe they weren't as bad as we remembered .  We were seated and it took around 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we noticed the table next to us that got seated latter and already had food before we even had water ok so that was no big deal it happens all the time at chains .  My husband ordered the $4.99 for 2 margarita's (I knew better) and I took a sip and it tasted like you licked a spoonful of dry artificial drink mix . (YUK)  This place had a MASSIVE amount of peanut shells and DUST all over the floor so if you were wearing flip flops you might cut your toes on shells .  They have a bucket of peanuts on every table and I hope little dirty kids hands weren't on them not to mention peoples coughs .  When my meal arrived I thought it looked ALMOST picture perfect because my vegetable skewer looked great with real fresh vegetables on it but when I tasted them they were awful because they brushed them with I COULD TASTE cheap Italian dressing and some sort of brown NASTY sauce (YUK) ! Then I saw my potato with all that melted whipped butter that looked like SPIT (YUK)! (it wasn't but looked like that the way the butter melted)  but maybe the WORST was what they did to the filet....WTB (bleep) they brushed the filet with liquid smoke and maybe a terriyakki sauce and that was another YUK! I consider the filet not edible the way it tasted and took it home for dog treats (I washed sauce off for my dog of course) The sauces on the vegetables and on my filet were awful and ruined them in taste and as far as I know they are not listed in description on menu . This was not the most expensive meal but not that cheap either (mine was $16) but even if it was free I still would not recommend . Now that I Yelped I will remember years from now that I didn't like .   One star ?  two stars ? but my understanding of definition is eeks me thinks not meaning I won't go back not just I had better...duh..I am not a fan of here.....maybe you are?.....not the best  quality but it really is too amateur to go out for it's like your relative that can't cook and just throws stuff in a bag with Italian dressing and then throws it on the grill .   it was close and I didn't feel like going far but I should have done a Logan's RUN AWAY!"}
{"text":"Normally when I go to a restaurant I'm not annoyed when I'm given a kids menu. It's kind of a compliment since I'm twenty-four and a little sensitive about my age due to having a younger boyfriend.   However, when I came here with my family the other day the hostess placed a kids menu down for me and thus began the silliest most awkward situation ever. My usual response is to just push it aside where my little brother is seated. Well when I did this the hostess promptly put another one down for me. This was so silly to me and my mother that we both laughed (in a non-rude way) The hostess then looked at me as if I were a naughty child and said, \"OH WOULD YOU LIKE A GROWN UP MENU??\" There wasn't even a hint of playfulness in her voice. She was serious.  Just about everyone heard. Normally I'm a pretty polite customer but I just rolled my eyes and mumbled, \"Yes, I'm twenty-four.\"  She didn't apologize and actually never brought me my own menu. I had to share with my MOMMY!  That hilarious story aside, the food is pretty good and reasonably priced. Their margaritas are buy one get one during Happy Hour so after a few of those the age situation was easily forgotten. My entire family ordered steak and said it was Houstons grade steak at Applebees price. I ordered fish and it was pretty good. They didn't charge me when I asked for a vegetable skewer instead of fries even though the skewer is more expensive on the menu.  Oh and also, I can throw my peanut shells on the floor. I feel like fucking royalty. The end."}
{"text":"I love the food here this place is not always busy but the servers and bartenders are so welcoming I always get sarah's section she is such a good multi tasked and never  loses her smile . I've been here 3 times and I first time I had her she was amazing each time"}
{"text":"The reviews I read were not especially glowing. I agree that the staff members are very friendly, accommodating, and attentive. I would also agree that the food is average. All of it has been in the good range, but it has not been great. I ordered a porterhouse steak, and found it to be tasty but tough, although it was cooked to specification. The salad was decent and the bread was quite good.  If you like free peanuts, have a day!"}
{"text":"It was a Thursday night and the restaurant wasn't too busy. I ordered the 16 oz rib-eye, medium well with Cesar salad and a baked potato and some of their fried mushrooms. My hubby had the full slab of ribs with a baked potato and a Cesar salad. I also had the house Margarita and hubby had a beer. My steak was thin and more than medium rare, more to medium and not even warm. My potato was not fully baked and not warm. My his baked potato was steaming hot, but not fully cooked. It was more like a rock. I had a second drink with the Prickly Pear Margarita. Supposedly, they put 1 1/2 shots of tequila in it, but I do not drink regularly and could not say I even had a happy buzz. I do wish the bartenders were FORCED to measure out the full shots instead of pouring them like they are in some movie. Why isn't anyone checking the food leaving this kitchen. How long does it take for a baked potato to loose it's heat or a steak to get cooled off? No one was on top of our server, Carlos, that night. It makes me feel horrible when I complain to a server. It seems like I am the fussy one, when it's really the chefs and the server and bartenders who are all slacking off. They need to be re-trained at best. Our bill was over $67.00 and not worth one penny  of it. Needless to say, we won't be back there. They have slacked off since we were last there."}
{"text":"Our group from work went here and had a great time.  Its a nice bar centered place with a nice variety in the menu.  Not too pricey, free peanuts that go on the floor and enough selection from red meat to vegetarian and dieters in our group."}
{"text":"This is a tough review,  When I usually do a review, it's a experience not only by me but also the family.  I was just OK with Logan's.  Service: The service was fine, the atmosphere was good. We actually had a very good time there, but please note! Next time we go there, we will be seating in the dining room. The bar is very uncomfortable. AND PLEASE WATCH YOUR STEP, wife almost fell! FOOD:  I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs w/fries. The ribs were cold, and maybe that took away any chance of a good experience? Ribs were tough, and just wasn't doing anything for me. Very disapointed about that, I was really in the mood for ribs. Fries were good, and their dinner rolls were great! Now for the rest of the family who had a great time. Daughter #1 had he usual chicken tenders and fries, Daughter #2 had Mac and Cheese, and the wife had a bake potato and salad. They all enjoyed their dinner, I had a piece of Daughter #1's chicken and it was very good, loved the texture and spices.  Like I said before, we'll comeback again"}
{"text":"We met friends here on a Tuesday night and this place was packed; we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  I have no idea why this place is so popular.  It is like a more expensive version of the Texas Roadhouse chain of restaurants (except Texas Roadhouse is much better).    For starters they bring out a complimentary basket of freshly baked rolls.  These rolls would be good, if they were not covered in some sort buttery, greasy, glaze (thank you for contributing the obesity epidemic in America).  I had one of their \"signature\" 8oz steaks with onions and onion strings.  I ordered the the greasy garlic butter on the side to avoid the heart attack.  I had the side salad and Mac and cheese for my sides. I'm pretty sure the Mac and cheese sauce was from a box.  The steak was DRY.    From what I saw, everyone else's food was ok...nothing special.  At least  our server was very friendly and attentive...this was the only positive thing about the restaurant.    If you really want to eat a steak or some kind of BBQ meat at a place with peanuts all over the floor, just go to the Texas Roadhouse.  It is cheaper and much better.  Skip Logan's."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend, took my mother out for a late Mother's Day dinner and she wanted a place she could have a steak, and I suggested Logan's and since she hadn't been there, she said Yes! Server was not well versed on their beers and didnt explain the sides or anything to us, we had to ask what the entrees come with. Food came out after a little bit of a wait but the 8oz sirloin was done just right, Skewer of mushrooms was tasty. The bread they serve before the meal was good, could have used another basket while we were waiting but oh well."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at the Logan's Roadhouse in Mesa Arizona around 230 in afternoon, on Friday, March 10th. Upon entering,  no one was at the reception desk and only about four tables in the entire restaurant were occupied.  After standing there for about three minutes, a busboy appeared from the rear the restaurant and pushed his tray on empty table and went and grabbed us some menus and took us to a table. He was clearly ill at ease, waiting on us in this role. He seated us gave us our menus and told us the server would be with you shortly. Despite the fact the restaurant was nearly empty, it still took three or four minutes before a server appeared. I was informed that the catfish that reallyI liked was no longer being served. When I decided to try a new fish and chips item being served, the server said \"you should know that some people do not care for the coleslaw that we serve with this meal because of the way it's made,\"  I asked her if I could substitute something else in place of the coleslaw? She said no. I told her I was more than willing to pay an additional cost to substitute another side. She said no, that I had to take the coleslaw.  My question is why tell a person an item is not good when you're unwilling to do anything about it.  As it turned out, she was correct and neither my wife or I chose to eat coleslaw, so was discarded, uneaten.  Other than the coleslaw, we found the rest of the meal to be very good.  After completing the meal, we presented our server with a five dollar off coupon that we been emailed along with our credit card.   After about three or four minutes, our server came by and informed us that there was a delay in processing our payment due affected no one could find a manager and he had to approve the five dollar discount.  The bottom line during our visit was that we got good food and horrible service. They showed absolutely no respect for our time.  After many years of going to Logan's, I can assure you this was our last time.  They recently closed the restaurant closest to our home and we drove over 20 miles to eat at this location.  Logan's name used to stand for great restaurant, now we realize that is a thing of the past."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Hadn't been here for a while and had forgotten that they don't have a lunch menu. I ordered the Route 66 Cheeseburger (steakburger with aged Wisconsin Cheddar, onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles red onion & sauce) and comes with seasoned shoestring french fries and a couple of soft, fresh rolls. For $7.99 I was stuffed. The food was tasty and the service was good. There was a country and western theme in the decor and the music. Parking was close to the door."}
{"text":"... We walked in on a Saturday around 5 and were seated right away! Thank goodness because I was so HUNGRY! Service was the best we've had anywhere in quite a while and portions had me STUFFED! Had to take home half of my burger! We will definitely be back, even if we have to wait for a table next time /)"}
{"text":"Fast no wait seating on a Saturday night ...but be prepared to pay for substandard food!"}
{"text":"The place is filthy. Sure there are peanuts all over the floor, but that is no excuse for the window blinds to be caked in dust and grease. I saw a waiter clean a table and just push the crumbs and every thing right on the floor. The place must be crawling with  pests and vermin."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  2 of the advertised appetizers were not available, Fillet was extremely overlooked, wings were fatty, and orders were delivered incomplete.  The worst part was the pulled pork which had been cooked so long that it was absent of any sign of moisture."}
{"text":"Tried this place because uh'hem it was reccomended. (Thanks Sarah) lol! We ordered take out the first time it was the worst ever looked like stuff fell on the floor. My kid had the roadies or w/e they were supposed to be like slider's there was 2 missing the meat! So we call to see what's up maybe they had an off night. The gm wanted to send us a gc for the meal ok....weeks go by we call her, again she apologizes. We finally get them and she had sent like 3x the original amount. YAY!  We decide to take some friends with us since it was FREE. Well once again it was pretty gross no one really ate much, 2 people got their filets they ended up well done. One was sent back and re-made. It ended up the same. They basically said if its later evening thats what your going to get no matter how you order them. The service is not so good and that makes 6 people never going there again, it's ok by me cuz I hate chain's. Will people ever learn chai's suck!?!? This place should not even get 1 star the best thing is the bucket's of peanut's. My daughter loved throwing the shells on the ground, I mean where else can your kid's do that on purpose?"}
{"text":"By far the most outstanding service we've ever experienced. Lisa was a wonderful server and Edd and Peter are a very professional management team. If 10 stars were an option they would all most definitely get them........WELL DONE!"}
{"text":"There were 5 of us and the only meal that came out edible was a salad. Over cooked and cold - took way too long - and just not worth it. Hate writing bad reviews but this place needs to step up their game big time."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a chain ... but if its what you are looking for, the prices are pretty decent, the steaks are good, and the staff is attentive.  This location - being right off the freeway and in a major shopping center - is always crowded for lunch and dinner.   Sitting down for lunch or dinner, you will be presented with a basket of rolls -- stay away -- unless you want a mouthful of bliss! I think I pounded through 4 of these before the appetizer ever makes it to the table. Rolls are unlimited -- so ask for MORE!  LOST STAR - I expect my steak and side to come out hot and steamy. Just not the case here on this visit. Even the kids commented on the \"steak bites\" being warm... they also like theirs hot. The service did make up for the lack of food prep. The waitress was constantly on top of drinks and tried her best to make the experience better."}
{"text":"I would honestly give this place less than 1 star if that's possible. First off we had to wait 15-20 minutes, which I wouldn't mind if they were busy, but the place was not busy at all. When we got seated we probably waited at least 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us while we watched the waiters talk and hang out by the kitchen. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich and I ordered grilled shrimp with a salad. The food came out freezing cold. It was terrible. The only good thing about this place was the bread and our waitress acted like it was coming out of her pay check when we asked for more. We are from out of town and thought we'd try a new place. I would have much rather want to the chili's or Cracker Barrel across the street. Save yourself the money and do not visit."}
{"text":"I took my date on what I thought would be a good night out. I had seen the bad reviews sprinkled with good reviews so I figured what the heck. Man I needed to listen to the poor reviews and do not make the same mistake I did. Here is how our night went Got seated quickly which is unusual for a Saturday night so that was a red flag, but I said lets see how everything else goes.  The service was horrendous, terrible, can't believe it was so bad. Saw the server 4x the whole meal and still was never told her name. So that's strike one in my book.  We finally ordered our meals and waited a while for the meal. I had a ribeye steak with fried shrimp and baked tater and my date had ribs and Mac n cheese..  Our dinner came after a while and my ribeye was awful. I let the server know who let me see a manager. I told him the ribeye was very fatty and tougher then it should be. He went back and re fired the steak and it came back even worse. I was not impressed with the steaks at all and didn't eat either one. The ribs were very tough and way over cooked. When we told the mgr he said that's how ribs are made and I know that is not true.  The one good thing that happened was he didn't make us pay for the crap meal. I appreciated that gesture but I will not be coming back to this place and I would never recommend anyone else to this place that's for sure"}
{"text":"In the beginning the service was good, the waitress was friendly and talkative. My bf and I both ordered steak, and that's where it went wrong. We ordered the steaks medium and they were dry and very well done. The manager happened to walk by when I cut into my steak and saw my disgusted face. And he got me a new steak and then I showed him that my bf's steak was just as dry and had a new one brought out. But after that the waitress was pissed off and tried to shove us out the door before my bf's new steak came out.  We weren't mad, we just wanted decent steaks. The second steaks came out juicy and tasty."}
{"text":"I mean it's a straight up and down, unapologetic corporate steakhouse. Big portions, heavy meals and standard menu items and staff. 'MERCA!  This isn't really anything special, but then again it's not expected to be so I'll give it 4-stars instead of 3 since there isn't really anything \"wrong\" with it...it's just boring."}
{"text":"I view Logan's as the Red Lobster of steak. If I'm on a budget, and just want meat without firing up the grill or am stuck for a bit in a shopping center, , I just have to keep my expectations in line . And for a lunch? it's not bad, 2 meals foe $14? Hey, thats close enough to fast food to be worth it. Salads aren't bad (Miss The Kegs Blue Cheese/ Caesar  though! I remember liking Ruby Tuesdays wings  years ago, next time I'm stuck at Tire Discounters... I might try  that instead.  Just remember where your going... and the low prices... and free peanuts, I find that with realistic expectations, this place delivers. Still Logans is fun for kids, and for some of us, thats the trump card!"}
{"text":"Good steaks. Generally little or no wait time. Good service, always make sure you are happy with your food. Good customer service, wait staff is generally attentive to needs. Food over all is a 4.5/5. Nice bar set up with lots of seats. Plenty of TVs if you want to catch a game."}
{"text":"Please save your money. Horrible Bar service, Horrible Kitchen service. Horrible tasting food. What else can I say to convince you? Unless you are a glutton for punishment!"}
{"text":"Service was shitty, peanut shells on the floor is minus points, and food was medicore at best. Why come here? I do not know. Many of other places that are so much better than this one."}
{"text":"Some people love this place.  went there once and haven't gone back.  There are just too many better places to go in Gilbert.   Some people love it, so try it once and see what you think."}
{"text":"My coworker and I ended up at Logans for dinner because we wanted to try something other than one of the MANY chain restaurants in the area (Olive Garden, Red Robin, PF Changs, etc). Well, we had good intentions, but later found out that Logans is a big chain too!  We did the 2 entrees for $14.99 Mon - Wed special because we are fiscally responsible employees. She had a pretty big plate of chicken fingers and I got a teeny tiny 6 oz steak. Even though that is the correct portion size, I guess you are just so used to seeing huge slabs of meat when you order steak! It was also pretty tough, but I suppose you can't expect filet for the price. I liked the loaded mashed potatoes, but the broccoli was drenched in butter which sort of defeated the purpose of ordering a healthy side. The roll was also fluffy and delicious and BUTTERY!  The special price is definitely cheap. You can even add a shared appetizer and dessert for an additional $5. Our server was super nice and checked on us many times. In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."}
{"text":"After our 3rd attempt at hoping for a good meal, we are giving up....  problems...under cooked chicken, cold fries...  we have never had a meal here that someone didn't have to have a meal recooked to order.  Extremely poor quality control...."}
{"text":"This is the place to go....Logans menu is great sooooo many choices and combinations the bar is very large and the music is really good.  Take a chance and drop by you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I loved my visit to Logan's Roadhouse. I go there once every 5 weeks or so. At first, I tried the steaks and chicken tenders but I have settled on a regular order of the Fried Chicken Salad. Their servers are friendly and I often end up having little chats with them because they are so approachable and accommodating. The desserts are very cute as well (I love the little buckets) and the birthday \"YEE-HAW\"'s are fun to witness. I will definitely continue my visits."}
{"text":"$1.50 Drafts, 'nuff said.  The new wings are awesome.  Hand breaded and tasty.  I love a joint that does not charge for extra bleu-cheese.    My wife and I split a Kickin' Chicken salad, it was a lot of salad and stuff on it, super good.    Did I say $1.50 drafts - hell yeah, git sum'  :-)"}
{"text":"After such a positive experience about a month ago, decided to go back for my mother's and my birthday with out of town guests. Out of four guests, only one order was done right. On one plate, the side was wrong. On two plates, the meat was overcooked and sent back for re-fire . An hour later, the two re-fires were cooked the same way. We were told that the delay was because we ordered medium well. Fine, even though I disagree. I don't believe that medium well should be chard halfway through the burgers or take an hour. After complaining again, we were finally told that they will look into an issue with the grill.  That  still doesn't explain why it took so long to get a check, couldn't get  beverages refilled, dirty dishes weren't cleared and nobody even said happy birthday when we explained that we were here for a special occasion. Very little empathy although the manager did remove the cost of the burgers from the check. I would rather pay the ~$20 and be able to enjoy my birthday with people who flew in and get what I ordered-- cooked to order. So very disappointed. I will not recommend again."}
{"text":"Came here on Memorial Day with a coupon in hand for Veteran's. I did not read the fine print. They do not give discounts in NC,SC for Veteran's. Service and food was good, but very disappointed that this organization cares so little about those who allow them to have free enterprise system."}
{"text":"This used to be a regular stopping place for us.  A few years ago there was a change in management that made a very negative change on the place.  Our last visit was 12.30.15 and  our last until things improve.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  I would prefer to see all the long hair tied back in a ponytail or something so that no hair is hanging down over the plates and salad prep station.  The meat served is probably the lowest grade sold for human consumption.  The 12 oz. ribeye was more like an 8 oz pre-cooked.  It is impossible to cook a steak to order when it is only 1/4 inch thick.  The sirloin steaks aren't any better.  Sometimes it is hard to tell if you got the ribeye or the sirloin as both have so much fat and grizzle.  On our last visit we chose the chopped steak.  We both ordered them medium well.  My husband ordered his without any seasoning, I should have done the same.  My steak was more medium than medium well and hubby's was closer to medium rare.  Any grill cook knows ground meat should not be served at those settings.  I added the onions, mushrooms and gravy on mine.  Even that didn't cover up the poor taste of the meat and the heavy seasoning.  I couldn't finish mine.  The sides are usually decent however my baked potato was hard and cold. Hubby's fries were good.  The salads are the only good part of the meal.  They are probably one of the few restaurants in the area that use fresh ingredients for the salads.  The lettuce is crisp and not the bagged salad generally served in restaurants.  The salads used to be larger but they are still good.    The rolls, Logan's used to have smaller rolls that were a little crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  The big air pockets aren't as good.  Ask the waiter to leave off the melted butter if you want a less greasy roll.  Oh, be sure to eat them quickly as they get tough as shoe leather when they cool off."}
{"text":"Amazing service by Terra...food was on point from the bread to the entree. Filet was cooked to perfection and the loaded mashed potatoes are to die for!!! Will definitely be going here more often! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Rough Lunch Meeting....   Ever had one of those days where you just wanted to go back to bed?  I took an employee of mine here for a business lunch and had never been here before. Keep in mind this was a few years ago and I have never gone back....  We got into the place and it looked decent... The service was super slow even though nearly nobody was in the place. We finally ordered our food so I went to use the men's room and clean my hands before the feeding....   I used the urinal and when I flushed the urinal shot dirty nasty pee water all over me waist down... Keep in mind I am in dress clothes trying to not smell like a swear rat...   I told the manager and he said that's strange and gave me a $1 ice cream scoop to make up for it...   We ate our dry meat and laughed about the experience and never returned....   I went home and showered and changed clothes.... Ugh...."}
{"text":"Food  - 2/5  Food was below-average at best. My steak tasted like it had freezer burn on the edges of the steak or like it had been microwaved. The side salad was good, I finished it but the veggie skewer was dry and the tomatos were old. My buddy did get the Southern Fried Fish and Chips (Catfish) and it looked pretty good and most everyone else at the table seemed satisfied with what they received and thats the only reason I gave the food any credit.  Service - 3/5 Waitress despite forgetting my beer was nice, she did use profanity when I mentioned she forgot my beer... I may have liked her more because of that tho.  Atmosphere - 3/5 Like most other \"Texas\" steakhouses it was loud but I could hear the other 6 friends I was with which was nice.  Price - 2/5 Based on the quality of the food I could have gone somewhere else and spend $20 for a ribeye and veggie skewer and been much happier. Drink specials were good and apparently they don't get much during the week because they have the big vinyl sign promoting 2 meals for $14.99 Mon - Wed.  Overall - You can find a better steakhouse in most strip malls, probably even the one Logan's Roadhouse is in..."}
{"text":"Awesomeness as usual.  Hubby tried something new this tine. The shrimp trio.   It was okay. But really, who goes to a steak house for seafood. Waiter was quick and attentive and a familiar place on a Friday night is a good thing."}
{"text":"I was ok Logan's but not impressed by anything they had. The food was expectable but nothing out of the ordinary. My steak was average and so was the service. I just don't have much to say about this place. There are simply better places to go that have the same food to offer."}
{"text":"The service was ok, but the meal itself was terrible. I understand that at a chain restaurant, the overall quality won't be amazing. It was obvious that the kitchen does not change or probably uses the same oil for everything; the dish I ordered (Nashville Hot Chicken) tasted like a giant shrimp. Everyone's french fries had a hint of seafood. It was very dissapointing since I paid $80 to basically bring leftovers home for my dog. So upset, and I wish I had gone to red robin next door."}
{"text":"Food was decent. My husband ordered the 16oz prime rib, I ordered the 12oz. They were delicious. There was absolutely no difference in size. We asked our waiter to look and he said \"well maybe it's just cut a bit thicker.\" It wasn't. Service was terrible. Saw our waiter, Andrew, a total of three times. None of our appetizer plates were cleared and we only received one refill. We were on a double date with another couple and one of them ordered a steak, medium rare, it was so pink she couldn't chew it. I was disappointed, but I think I just had my expectations too high. I would describe this place as a more poorly run Texas Roadhouse. Great place for not to pricey food, but not the greatest in quality. We are also grown adult couples and he assumed we were all on the same check without asking. Me being a waitress myself when I was younger was just disappointed in the lazy mistakes by the waiter. Always treat your customers like they are visiting a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"The best happy hours with plenty of yummy options to choose from. I'm definitely coming here more often. The service is very good and attentive. We were approached by an opening of the door and greetings. She went to clear out a table and while waiting, we were approached soon after again. Great service. Food came out warm and delicious. Ribs, grilled shrimp, sauteed mushrooms, geogia Sun tea and moonshine margarita were all good. Will be back"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends. Nice place, good music.  Side salad is big.  Had salmon was delicious. Great service and wasn't crowed at all and good location."}
{"text":"I had ribs form other Logan's restaurants and don't like them, but this one is really really good."}
{"text":"2 Stars are for the service, which we had a very nice server.  Bad taste in food and drink, but very nice.  At best this restaurant is eh...or below average.   The food is of less quality than the average chain located all around this restaurant.  Nothing came out hot so the food was warm/cold and the meat is cooked well unless you ask.  Any place that cooks their food well unless asked is hiding their quality.   This is a Roadhouse place, where when they first opened the peanut shells were thrown into the ground and the food was good.  So on the advice of others it has become a choice of all evils in what they call the Norterra.  With all of these chains I should have know what was to come.  Happy Hour signature tea drinks were horrible.  They were at least strong but I'd rather have it strait if I wanted a kick.  Their nachos were like Chili's chips with a not so liked array of toppings...can/instant tasting.  Wings are small and soft with a nasty aftertaste.  And now the burger...  Although I didn't try their steak, which I can't imagine being any better.  But to cook a burger well and have the specialized ons taste generic is such a negative.   I would hands down of rather of had an In-n-Out burger and feel satisfied.  But I will say the fries are not that bad...regular or the sweet potatoe.  If they actually came out hot.  Oh, and their free peanuts are actually good as well.  So as a punishment for not following my instincts... I deserved this bad meal and lesson.  But as a Yelp'er to another Yelp'er...please don't make my mistake.   Or go to Red Robin's right next door."}
{"text":"Best deal in Gilbert. They have a deal on the weekdays where you can get 2 full meals for $13.99.  You have a choice of many entrees and side. Its not Outback but its still really good. The rolls are awesome. The service is good.  Free peanuts. Ever since this has been open I havent been back to Texas Roadhouse. Logans is half the price and almost as good. If you are looking for a good dinner for a great deal, check out logans."}
{"text":"I decided to come here with my mother to take her out on a nice lunch date. I ordered salmon, a salad, and one of their specialty alcoholic drinks. It was super slow at the time and the waiter was slow as well.  My mom tried to order 3 different things from the menu, but was told they didn't have it in stock. So she settled for some steak and a side of mushrooms. We waited an hour before our food even came out. Good thing I had a salad to hold me over until then. When we did get our food, my salmon looked like it had been sitting in the window for 30 mins. Not fresh at all! My moms mushrooms were SO SALTY she couldn't eat them.  I finally god fed up. I'm not about to pay all this money for crappy food.  I called the waitress over to tell her that I wanted to talk to a manger about our experience.  I told her that I didn't want to pay for the food. I told her that i felt bad because I've NEVER done this before, but i don't want to waste my money on food i refuse to eat. I also told her that I'll pay for our drinks and my salad but not the food. She was understanding and comped the whole meal. Which was really generous. She had said that they got new cooks and that she was going to take care of it.  Funny thing is I went here a year or 2 prior to this experience and it was TERRIFIC! I don't know what happened since then other than the new cooks. But I won't be coming here again.   My mom and I ended up going to KFC afterwards and it was FUCKING DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Service usually is not good to me. They seem to have bad attitudes but the food the two times I have been has been really good. Better food than some of the expensive fancy steak houses around town."}
{"text":"Logan's is a good restaurant, I fool with it. Their steaks taste better than Ruth Chris'"}
{"text":"Mack the bartender was awesome...even not feeling100%  made me feel so welcome! Thank you Mack!"}
{"text":"Not a great food experience. These franchise food places should spend a little more on a well trained kitchen staff and let their food do the talking. I had a pre-formed, frozen burger with a breaded and deep fried cheap commercial cheese patty on top. Fries were average at best.  Won't be going back to any of their establishments."}
{"text":"We ate here the food was good the only problem was a part of our food was burnt and they took very long to get us our bread and butter and it took then a while to get our check and some boxes for our food."}
{"text":"I think they got a new chef/cook. We went for a company lunch today and it was great.   1. Chili 5 stars 2. Open faced roast beef w/ mashed spuds 5 stars 3. Roadies/sliders 5 stars 4. Chicken salad 5 stars 5. Buffalo Chicken sandwich 5 stars x 2 people 6. Burgers 4 stars x 3 people.  7. BBQ pork 3 stars onlt because it had slaw on top.   Very solid reviews from ewveryone at the table."}
{"text":"We had a nice date night at Logan's. We went on a Monday night football kinda night. And although I couldn't see the TV, the Cowboys where loosing. I knew this because a \"regular\" and the bartender where both yelling at the screen. I would say other than this annoyance we had a nice time. Food was cooked perfect, waitress was very friendly and helpful. If in gastonia I would go back again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night with a party of 6. We were told a pretty accurate wait time, so no issues about that. The service was horrible and the food was nothing spectacular. My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf. He ordered it medium rare and it was rare. He did not send it back, so maybe that's on us. But the rice pilaf on both of our dishes wasn't very appealing or appetizing at that. Secondly, the service. Our waitress was late on everything. Drink refills=NOT GOOD. We observed other tables having to get up and get their own drinks! The food from order to serve was long and it all came out at different times. I really DISLIKE that scenario- especially with 4 or more people. Please bring everything out at the same time. Do they not have trays??? Am I crazy to think we should all be served at the same time?? Lastly, there was an issue with gift cards we purchased from Sam's club. They claimed that one did not have any balance on it. How could that be possible, they were just purchased? The waitress even claimed she tried it several times with witness of her manager. I believe her but how come the manager didn't come out to tell us? Upon further review of the gift cards and receipts, I noticed that she apparently was trying to use one twice. DUH! I had 4. She didn't think to audit the numbers to see which ones she had swiped and which ones would be left? So apparently that's why she was getting a declined notice back. She was trying to swipe one twice. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out-- well maybe it does and I work with rocket scientists!! At any rate. It was my first and last visit. With all of these issue, never saw a manager, wasn't impressed with the food and the service wasn't any better than a McDonalds. I wouldn't recommend wasting any time, money or energy at this place!"}
{"text":"I loved their sweet tea!  I also ordered fried pickles and chicken strips.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awful restaurant! Filled with incompetent staff and terrible management. We've been to other Logan's locations in other states and always had a good experience. We will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"They switched our steaks the shrimp was supposed to be grilled and was rubbery  The matter did take off 50% off from the bill and took the strip off the bill but still very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Love the bucket of peanuts. We were seated near the bar which I think is the trainee section. The server was friendly but slow and did not know the wines on the menu. They must be animal friendly as my T-bone steak must have died naturally of old age. Very dry and tough. Ordered a second beer, when it came it was not the same brand as I ordered the first time. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The epitome of cheap, casual dining. Free peanuts and bread followed by mediocre entrees. The highlight of my visit was the service. Everyone we encountered acknowledged us and were very friendly, however, that alone isn't worth returning for."}
{"text":"I went to Logan's for dinner last night and it was very good. Me and my daughter got the fillet Mignon's, she got broccoli(which she loved) and mashed potato sides and I got the mushroom skewers and the baked sweet potato. Everything was so good I am already planning a trip back."}
{"text":"We've been to Logan's quite a few times. They have a good deal Mon-Wed where you can get 2 full course meals with sides for $14. I'm a fan of their catfish, but overall they have good all American-fare cuisine. The staff is very friendly. Peanuts were a but gross."}
{"text":"Food is ok but definitely don't go in within an hour of there closing time. They definitely make you feel unwelcome ."}
{"text":"4/22/09  My daughter suggested we ago here after we tossed around a few suggestions.   It turned out they were having their \"2-for $13.99\" special and it was Happy Hour to boot--killer!  She got the Salmon and I got the 6 oz sirloin.  Both were delicious, though her salmon wasn't as moist as some I've had.  My skewered grilled veggies were wonderful, The \"Brewskie onions\" were disappointing, though they gave me a lot for 99 cents.  The mac and cheese was very good hot but got kind of gummy as it cooled off.  We got the 3 for $5 mini desserts which were all from heaven, gooey and rich and sweet and just the right amount to enjoy without OD-ing on the richness.  Oh and TWO margueritas for $4.50!  Wow.  Good ones, too.  We left happy and not broke."}
{"text":"We go here all the time.  Excellent yeast rolls, their shrimp skewers are very yummy and amazingly they are usually cooked perfectly - not overdone.  Steaks are usually cooked well too.  Sometimes service is lacking even when they are not busy, but it is still good food."}
{"text":"I ate there last night for the first time so I had to order the \"Logan\" steak.  It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.  The steak was juicy and well-seasoned.  The fries were a little stale and the steamed broccoli was...well...just steamed broccoli.  The best thing though was the warm rolls dripping with melted butter."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have gone here twice for dinner. We have been seated right away and the hosts were very nice (opening the door for us, saying hi/bye as we came in and left). The rolls are indeed the best! Mmm, honey butter... My fiance has liked his seafood ok the last couple times and the little mini \"porkies\" are delicious. They are served on those yummy buttery rolls. They may just need a side of bbq if you're used to sloppy bbq as opposed to dry. Not sure how I feel about those peanuts. We used to have  Lone Star Steak House back in Illinois that was not allowed to do that due to health code violation?"}
{"text":"Had a large party (15 ppl). We chose to go here over Texas Roadhouse because we were able to make a reservation and we could all be seated together. They had our table ready and seated us right away, but that is where the good service stopped. Unfortunately our server must have been new and was not able to keep up with the table. All the food came out at the same time, which we definitely appreciate, but less than half the food was hot. Must have been sitting under a broken heat lamp for quite some time. We told the manager, and of course they offered to re-make the food but we have small children and there is no way they were going to sit through another 15 minutes of waiting. They did offer  free desserts, which two people ordered, but they took upwards of 10 minutes to come out with them so we just ate a couple bites and had to leave. I usually come here for my birthday, even though we usually have issues similar to this. Since we usually have issues, I tried to have this dinner at Texas Roadhouse but decided not to because they don't take reservations and cannot seat a party of this size together. Next year I'm going to have to think of another location for my group because it is just not worth the hassle. I hate that I have to give a bad review for this place, I was so hoping that they would make me happy to choose them over Texas Roadhouse but it just made me wish even more that Texas Roadhouse would be able to accommodate my party."}
{"text":"What vegetarian goes to a place like Logan's Roadhouse? The kind that will sacrifice herself for the sake of her people because she drove all the way from San Diego to AZ at midnight and had no kind of sleep, but still managed to get there and say, \"Hey, I'm taking all you fools out to dinner, my treat, where do you want to go???\"  And, they picked this place. Oh woe is me.   If you've been to Texas Roadhouse, then you've been to Logan's Roadhouse. I'm pretty sure it's the same damn place. Peanut shells on the floor, MEAT and potatoes galore, and loud people everywhere--Which is fine, because my people are very loud.   The overloaded mashed potatoes was a hit, I was pissed that they were out of onion petals, and our waitress seemed really confused. But, she was nice, so I can't really talk too much crap.   As long as everyone in my party had a good time, I'm happy."}
{"text":"The rolls are delicious, good mango lemonades, and their country fried chicken was awesome.  Also got a minibucket nutter butter which was great. And we got to keep the little bucket! So cute!"}
{"text":"Been to Logan's multiple times and it seems to be going down hill. The food is pretty bland and my fiancé has awful luck. Almost every time he has to send his food back because it's underdone or over cooked whether it's a steak or burger.   Service is always good and usually no wait but food is just okay. I would rather spend a few extra dollars and go to another steak house."}
{"text":"Save your money bartenders are rude they don't make you feel welcome prices are a little spendy and did I mention or tenders are rude also I just learned they're going out of business"}
{"text":"Yeast rolls are fantastic!  Mozzarella sticks are a good appetizer. Crispy on outside, good marinara dip.   Ribeye is cut too thin and was excessively fatty, but good flavor. Mash potatoes are good, brown gravy is not bad. Mac and cheese side is ok.   Overall good value."}
{"text":"It was great. Being our first time, the server was very courteous and did a good job answering our questions about the food. Never been into a place where you have a bucket of peanuts and you just throw the shells on the floor. My son LOVED that part. It was a good time and the portions were pretty sweet."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and will continue to go back. The service has always been great. I've never had a problem with the food, and they have the best salads around. Love the huge rolls too!  This isn't the best steak restaurant you'll ever go to, but it's definitely not as bad as some imply. Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but it's a great, fairly inexpensive place to go for a nice dinner every now and then."}
{"text":"Very casual with peanut shells on the floor and can be low cost.  Love the \"everything salad\" adding steak strips or grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Came here with some family that was visiting from out of town to celebrate our moms birthday.  You can't beat 2 meals for $15.49. The food was delicious and the service was excellent!! So glad we decided to eat here tonight."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Happy Valley location for dinner on a Monday night. The restaurant was busy. We stood and waited for the hostess to acknowledge our presence. At first she glanced over but then continued to talk with her co-worker; we waited for a few more minutes before she finally seated us. Once seated, the waiter did come over and ask us what we would like to drink. He made a remark about my husband's t-shirt he was wearing (Star Wars) and then brought us our ice teas. He gave us some time to look at the menu and we asked him about the special menu that is offered Mon. Tues. and Wed. they are lunch sized portions (teriyaki chicken, meatloaf, grilled salmon, strip steak, etc., served with two sides for $14.99). We decided on the grilled salmon and we chose our two sides. The waiter then brought us out two warm rolls with butter and small plates. We did not have any silverware and eventually had to take it off of another table nearby that was not occupied. We ate the rolls and the waiter returned and asked if we would like some more and we said yes. He said it would be a few minutes until he would have some more. He saw my tea was empty after passing by our table several times and finally asked if I would like some more tea. I told him yes, but it would be another 10 minutes before he brought me out another glass and the tea was warm with melting ice floating in it.  After the waiter passed by our table more times than I can count, always bringing other diners their food and glancing at our empty table, he finally stopped and asked if we had received our food and we told him no. His response: Oh, I don't know what happened. I will go back to the kitchen and find out. Several minutes later, a man came out without introducing himself to us and said he would have our meals out in the next 5 minutes as he was putting the order in. Stating: I don't know what happened to your ticket or why you haven't received your food. Another 10 minutes passed and out came two meals we didn't order and we had to tell the waiter these are not what we ordered. We ordered the grilled salmon, remember? to which a puzzled look came over his face. The meals were swiftly removed and returned to the kitchen. My husband and I looked at each other. We decided we had had enough of the excuses and poor service, at that point we just wanted to leave. We walked to the hostess station and told the hostess, who asked us for table number were we were seated at. We explained to her what occured and that we wanted to pay for our ice teas. Another waiter was hanging out at the hostess station and he apologized stating if he knew of the situation he would have done something, as in locating our waiter. We told him our waiter knew of the situation. Our waiter appeared and said \"the drinks are on me.\"  No apologizes were forthcoming from him or the manager or the hostess on the situation.  We were waiting for our food for over an hour. We will not return and we would not recommend this Logan's Roadhouse.  Apparently they are selective of whom they serve and I guess we didn't make their \"cut.\" For this reason, I am giving them one star."}
{"text":"One star is really too much. We went to the one in north Phoenix (next to Red Robin) on a slow Monday night. It took forever to place our order, then over an hour to actually get the food. It definitely wasn't worth the wait. I'm pretty sure my shrimp wasn't cooked and the only veggies on the shrimp and veggie skewers were onions and barely-cooked zuccinni. The waitress wasn't even a bit apologetic for the wait or quality. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Took a friend there he said he had eaten there about a year ago.. We ordered chicken wings before our steak after eating some of them we realized  they where raw in the center I told the waitress and manager she said they may have not cooked them enough another manager said they come in already cooked ( so which is it ?)both of us got sick from eating the chicken I asked him about the last time he was there and he said he got sick then to... but he thought it had changed!!! I will not be back. I contacted their office and they said \" They could not be raw they come in cooked\" I told him that  those wings where still clucking!!! He offered to replace the meal I said ... I eat alot of things raw but, not chicken... no thank you I will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you've ever eaten at Texas Roadhouse but haven't tried Logan's Roadhouse  you know exactly how Logan's Roadhouse is going to be. Not bad food and reasonably priced it's your typical Roadhouse style restaurant. Worth the stop if you're in the mood for that type of food."}
{"text":"Logans roadhouse is a total waste of money. I can make a better steak in the comfort of my home and be in a comfortable not grungy cheap environment like this place.  I always dread when my boyfriends sisters parents choose this place over chilis.  The \"high quality\" steaks are so rough and disgusting.  I should be a steak connoisseur between my brother and I on how much actual Good steak we have ate since we were young we should be on a show to grade steak.    Short and simple...Do NOT waste your money here.  Unless you like cheap low budget steak this is your place ill spend an extra 20 and a get a real steak at a real Steak house"}
{"text":"It's a family favorite!  We love the 3pm-6pm 7days a week 2/$15 special!  It's a great deal for tons of food.  We usually have enough food for lunch the next day.  The rolls are so yummy and it is hard to have just one.  The staff is always super nice and service is speedy."}
{"text":"We don't live near a Logans but sometimes end up near this one.  They are always packed on the weekends and most nights during the week.  If you want a table you better get there early or prepare to wait 30-60 mins especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  My husband and I usually just sit at the bar..........it's pretty easy to come up with 2 seats there.  They have beer specials usually.  We usually get a 24oz PBR for 3 bucks I think.  I always order the same thing here=The kickin chicken salad!!  It is always fantastic!!  My husband gets the wings and my salad is big enough he munches off of it to.  He is very picky about wings and says they are awesome to.  Bar service is always friendly and fun and the bar is a great place to people watch!! ;)"}
{"text":"We enjoy lunches here. The tilapia is good but the broccoli is usually under cooked. Today.... well, it's a holiday! so forget the healthy stuff :)  I had a fried cheese and bacon burger! OMG.... I should say it slowly... F R I E D CHEEEESEEE & BaCoN burger. I didn't want to do it but I was talking to the waitress who was VERY friendly and telling her my love of burgers, she recommended it to me and the sweet Tea which was peach and had a good healthy amount of vodka in it. DELISH.  The burger was better than I had hoped it was moist, dripping creamy fried cheese with nice thick sliced bacon and shoe string fries on the side with ranch dressing.   You no longer throw peanuts on the floor they have lil buckets at the tables for that and THAT makes me very happy. never was a fan of walking on peanuts... sounds like egg shells.   I have been here several times and it was over due for a review and this one needs to go on my love of burgers page. :)"}
{"text":"I tried you all 3 years ago for lunch, you sucked. I thought I would give it one more try last night for dinner. You sucked!!!! Never even got my meal. The busy body orange and red haired waitress was to busy gabbing with friends at another table. Waited 20 minutes for food and a refill on your flat beer, when I called her over to check she said we were 4th in line to be served. I said never mind. You suck!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not much for giving low/single star ratings, but I feel pretty strongly about this one.  The only thing that I enjoyed was a full glass of diet coke whenever I ran out, but that's it.  The apps (we got a trio)were greasy and didn't taste like much other than grease. The poor pickles that were sacrificed to be fried  . . . Doomed to a life of no pickle flavor! I also ordered the grilled meatloaf. I took a bite and the rest was trashed. The baked potato was tolerable.  Even the salad was lackluster, and it's pretty hard to mess up a garden salad. I will not return. I will say that my meal was credited and I didn't have to pay for it, but that should be expected when it's so terrible I couldn't even try a second bite."}
{"text":"This place is hit or mess. On a good day they're a great place to eat and a good value with excellent service. On a bad day they can be horrible."}
{"text":"OK. I was scared at first but now I'm a fan. My BF isn't known for having exceptional taste in food. His idea of gourmet is In&Out.  Yeah...... But it was his b-day so he gets to choose right! This place rocks a 2 dinner meal with 4 sides total for under 20 rocks! Scary huh, the steak was delish & I'm so picky that I don't hardly eat steak not off my grill because I'm a food snob. Loaded mashed potatoes, loaded sweet potatoes, sautéed mushrooms..... It was all good. For as packed as it was on a weeknight the food came out quick & the waitress, god rest her soul for putting up with us (me primarily), was on the ball. I'll definitely tear this joint up again. Way to go BF!"}
{"text":"The only reason Im giving this two stars is because our waitress was great and her customer service was outstanding.  Other then that, everything was horrible.  Everyone's steaks were tough, over cooked and had no flavor.  Our whole party ordered their steaks either medium to medium rare and they were all cooked thoroughly through with not even the slightest amount of pink showing.  The side dishes were okay but the mashed potatoes seemed dry too!  Hey, at least the beer was cold and refreshing.  We definitely wont be returning to Logan's anytime soon! Did not leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Decent chain steakhouse.  It is pretty much what you would expect from any similarly priced chain steakhouse.  The food is good but not great.  The have a decent alcohol selection.  The service is pretty good. All in all for the price I would say its pretty good."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin.  Went here because my 16 year old remembered when he was much younger that he loved the peanuts and mac n cheese so he convinced us to go.  The peanuts were very stale.  My son asked \"are the peanuts supposed to be wet?\".  No .... they are stale.  I ordered the grilled chicken and it was horrible. The texture was really odd and the taste very weird.  My husband had the chicken tenders which were okay however would have been cheaper and taste better if you went to a fast food restaurant.  Bottom line we will never go back.  The one positive is that I had a 25% off so didn't buy full price. Date of visit was 8/13 at approximately 6:30pm.  You can message me through the Yelp tool."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Roadhouse restaurants, they are one of my favorites. Logans is a great steakhouse with a wide variety of menu items. I go here with family all the time and there is always something for everyone. My family loves steak and so most of us tend to order the steak menu items and never regret it. I get their teriyaki steak special and it is always cooked perfectly, I order it medium rare. Their dinner salads are good as well, and their rolls are always hot and tastey. I prefer the rolls/butter at Texas Roadhouse but Logans is alright too. Ambiance is nice, and the servers are always very nice and quick with food and drink refills. I've been there several times, and the couple times my steak or one of my familys' steak was under or over cooked they always took that meal off our check. Very friendly, good food, allover great restaurant."}
{"text":"High heels, smooth floors & peanut shells. Not a good combination! That's really the only con I can come up with & it's partially my fault,,,,, damn my love of high heels!   I haven't been to many roadhouses, but I'm going to say that this one is lovely. It's nicely decorated, service is quick & friendly & the absolute best part, as it should be with all restaurants, is that the food was oh-so good!   I was there for lunch & had The Logan Sirloin 6 oz steak with a veggie skewer & a sweet potato. The steak was cooked to perfection, the veggies were delic & the sweet potato was good, but freakishly large.   All in all, the perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the rib eye.  It was delicious!  The service was awesome as was the manager. The rolls they give you are fresh hot and delicious. I'm sure I have found one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"The other Logan's Roadhouse's seem to have better reviews on Yelp.  I haven't been to any of those so I can't compare; however, after going to this location twice and ordering different things each time it leaves much to be desired.  The steak quality is sub-par and everything is overpriced for what it is.    I came in later on a Sunday evening. I waited more than five minutes to be greeted even though quite a few of the servers noticed me.  They do weird things here.  For instance, they will bring you one cup with ice, but then refill it by bringing you another glassful in a paper cup.  I'm lost on the logic here.  Does someone think ice or washing glasses costs more than throwing away multiple paper cups per customer?  I watched a server also scoop peanuts off of a booth bench and put them back in the peanut bucket. Ummm..simply...gross.    The food is forgettable and not worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Do not expect service to be expedited if you walk in to take out. The food is good but the service in house and take out are lacking. For a steak house it is mediocre at best. They do have great value dinners if you are on a budget but it is not my first choice for steak house. The last time here, I think the host had never taken a to go order before and was unsure of how to go about doing such a task."}
{"text":"I feel.... accomplished.   I lost 15 lbs.   I didn't slip and die.  My husband didn't crash and burn from a peanut allergy. Not that I'm about here to sit and bitch about peanuts or how far from hygienic peanut shells all over a floor is... Or how bad peanut dust coating every fixture looks. Nah. Not gonna bitch about the ambiance, since it's a road house. Kinda cute.  What I am going to choose to whine about and kick up that peanut dust over... Sand. All. Over. My. Sweet. Potato.  That's right.  Sand  Black, gritty, nasty, sand.   Sand that filled my open mouth when I was expecting the awesome bite of cinnamon and sugar and sweet potato and and and marshmallows... But no. Sand. Sand filled my senses with it's gritty, iron tasting nastiness. And much to my horror... It was ALL OVER my plate.  The waitress AND manager argued with me over the fact it was sand. They tried to say it was cinnamon. Allow me to launch a contradiction, my friend, cinnamon is not gritty and sandy and does not shine like ground glass when I swipe my finger over my plate and show you.   Finally when I continued to insist and yet ANOTHER manager came over... They digressed and admitted it was sand and apologized profusely.  Fine. Free meal that was ruined. Great.  And then it continued.  EVERYONE and I do mean everyone, that ate dinner at my table (Hubby, a friend and myself) suffered a GREAT round of the almighty needle hole. You know... When your #2 is the consistency of #1 and you could squirt through the eye of a needle? Yeeeeeah. I'll leave you with that repulsive thought and know that no less than 40 minutes after vacating the Logan;'s Roadhouse premises we were ALL hit with that lovely and intense urge.  And it continued  For a day and a half.  Though I have to say the steak was tasty and I sincerely thank them for the crash diet.   Thumbs up pause NOT!"}
{"text":"I love the salads! I came in on Thursday lunch and John greeted me with his name and a menu immediately. He was very friendly and very attentive! I will give him five stars.! I will say I am used to having Charlene wait on me at the bar. She knows my name knows what I drink and is extremely personable! I was very sad to see that she doesn't work there. After that long I don't know what happened but I feel like you lost a great part of your business"}
{"text":"The food is good...but every time I have been here the service is mediocre at best. I asked for a refill on my soda, the server took it, walked by my table empty handed twice, then finally brought my refill. It's not even that busy..."}
{"text":"This place is great. A lot of nice workers. I came at 6pm and was seated fairly quickly. They had a lot of things on their menu including appetizers, salad, soup, seafood, and burgers. I ordered the potato skins and they were delicious (crunchy skins). Then I ordered the chicken tenders and the batter was really good. I just wish it was beer battered. Other than that, the environment is great. Theirs unlimited warm buttery rolls and peanuts on the floor. Also! Country music is always playing! What can be better than that?!"}
{"text":"Food and service left much to be desired I felt like staff weren't very happy there and the environment & food need a makeover."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 30 mins for our meal only for the server to come and tell us that they messed up our order. Waited another 30 mins and nothing was comp'd."}
{"text":"We went to Logan's two nights in a row! Delicious food and great service both times. They recognized us from the night before so it felt like they gave us extra everything, they even gave us a dessert on the house, THANK YOU!! We will definetly go back to Logan's if we're going to Phoenix again someday. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was good.  We won't be returning, though.  They are trying to be like TX Roadhouse, with the peanuts. Which is fine, but they are so overpriced, and the food was horrible!  The only thing we liked was the bread, and the baked potato soup was wonderful.  I got filet mignon. and a sweet potato. Both tasted horrible (how do you ruin those?).  The filet had waaaaaaaaay too much seasoning on it and I couldn't eat it. No clue what they did to the sweet potato. The waitress asked if we wanted to talk to a manager; I said no, this is our first time here and we won't be returning due to price and qualilty, and no need to talk to a manager about it.   My hubby got an appetizer for his meal and it was quite small, so if you normally do that kind of thing, beware that it is a smaller portion."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience during lunch a couple days back. The server was friendly, the food was good and the prices were fair. I am eating a restricted diet, and found the menu to have many healthy, low calorie options."}
{"text":"Our service was great when we first got in, then our food never showed up. Eventually I asked for the check for our drinks and salads and the manager came over and told us she would be right out with our food. My steak was delicious. She did comp our meal (which is not what I wanted but its a free meal and I was way ticked) our server did come back to refill drinks and finally did apologize. But still she walked by like 6 times without acknowledging us or even thinking \"hey, it's been 45 minutes why don't they have their food?\""}
{"text":"Logan's food was surprisingly good.  I admit I wasn't expecting much when I went the first time, but my girlfriend and I went on a Monday night for their two meals for $15 deal (M, T, W only).  For that price you get two entrees with two sides each.  The deal and the food was better than Applebee's.  I recommend the steak or the tilapia.  The baked potato and vegetable skewers were very good sides too.  They have good bread while waiting for your meals.  For $5 more you get an appetizer and dessert to split too.  Again, a better deal than Applebee's.  They lose a star for subpar service.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this Logan's Roadhouse. This restaurant has been empty both times, so that must say something. The first time, it was just ok. This time...  We were seated right away in a half booth high top, aside the bar. It was like they sat us in an igloo. So cold! The bucket of peanuts in the table had a mixture of peanuts, shells, crayons and other junk. I was scared to eat them...didn't seem super sanitary. The two stars were foe our server. She was very kind, and got us everything we needed.   The bar. There were several televisions, but of course, I couldn't see the one with the Red Sox game...it was over my head. Oh well. There were children sitting at the bar. Not ok. The bartender never said anything, nor did a manager. The kid was pretty much sleeping on the bar to boot.   We both ordered a filet mignon, I with a grilled mushroom skewer and broccoli; J with the mushroom skewer and a sweet potato. I ordered my filet medium, while he likes it mooing. I also had the prickly pear spiked lemonade, while he enjoyed a Blue Moon. The drinks were great. Two had my head a little loopy....  The meals came. The server informs me that my mushrooms will be right out. But J has his skewer. Weird. My broccoli is tepid and mushy. My steak was AWFUL. Now, I'm not a big meat eater, which is why I went for the filet. Contrary to what it ahould be, it was fatty and rubber-tough. I passed half of it to J, who loves the fat. He promptly passed it from mouth to napkin. Steak sauce couldn't make it any better.  I am of the mindset that if you have to use sauce, you didn't cook it right. Yep. Half was rare, half was overcooked. This steak was a mess. J said his was ok, but very chewy.  For $40 plus tip for two, this was not worth it. Now I know why they are always empty."}
{"text":"Have had two different experiences! One time food not cooked well, poor service! I would of given it one star, BUT, have been back several times, and it was great!!! So I will forgive and forget! Lol"}
{"text":"So we went there tonight for my belated Birthday Dinner. I read previous yelp reviews and since they are pretty mixed we decided to give them a chance. Well, let's start with the good.  First of all, when we arrived, they had a good amount of cars in the parking lot, but we were fairly promptly seated. Our waiter, his name was Jerry, greeted us within a couple of minutes of sitting down, took our drink order and brought them out pretty fast. We mentioned to Jerry that the table we were sitting at felt sticky and you could scrap something (don't know what it was) off the table. Jerry wiped the table for us with a clean and wet rag, but the stickiness remained, but we decided to live with it. He did offer to move us to a different table, but the only open up at the time, was sticky as well (we tested it before he asked). Jerry took our food order and brought the salads to us fairly fast. The salads were nice and cold, the dressing good, the lettuce fresh. The Dinner Rolls were warm, also, of the 3 brought to our table, 2 of them were smashed.  My Husband had ordered the Prime Rib, which he ordered medium, he had the mashed potatoes with gravy. He liked both very much, but wasn't very hungry so he had to take his food home.  Now the bad. My Son ordered the 16oz Ribe-eye, medium, topped with Garlic Butter and their Brewsky Onions with loaded mashed potatoes and I ordered the 16oz Rib-eye, medium rare with a Baked Potato fully loaded. On the their menu, loaded showed to include green onions, which were missing, but that was not much of a big deal to me. What was a big deal was that my son's steak and mine were really, really rare. When Jerry brought us the steaks he asked us to cut into them to see if they were to our liking. My husbands was fine, but we had to ask him to cook our's some more. About 5 min or just a tad over the manager (I assume) brought us out the steaks and apologized and told us they would take off 5 bucks of the total. After the manager left we started cutting into the steaks and realized they were still raw for mine and my son's now was medium rare. Jerry checked on us and we told him about the missing Brewski Onions and Garlic Butter and to please make sure we were not charged for it and I also pointed out that my steak was still raw, which he acknowledged and offered to have it cooked some more, but I had really lost my appetite by now and I just asked for a box so that I could take my steak home and cook it myself. Jerry apologized again and told us that they were going to take off 15 bucks now instead. Also, I do want to mention, after trying a couple of bites of my steak and my son who ate all of his, the steaks have no seasonings whatsoever. My son had to drown his steak in steak sauce to add a flavor, I added a bunch of salt and pepper to mine, but since it was still way to raw to eat, just put it in a to go box and I hope it will cook up okay tomorrow.   The reason I still give them 3 stars is because of Jerry. He told us that he was new to the Restaurant and that this was only his 6th day of work, but he made our not very happy experience a lot more pleasurable by his attentiveness and pleasant personality. I hope he will succeed with Logan's or any other restaurant.  As far as us coming back, chances are slim to none. Even so I liked our waiter, the food was for a steakhouse not good at all. If you call yourself a steakhouse, the number one thing you should be able to do is cook a steak. Logan's failed in this regard."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the food. It was kinda of a let down since our Friends raved about it.   Even the service was poor. I most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Ugh. Food was not impressive, service was MUCH less than stellar. Rude, actually. If I spend $40 for one person, I expect better. Of our group of 5, 2 of us enjoyed our meals and 0 of us enjoyed our service."}
{"text":"I would love to give a 5 stars to the chefs my meat was delicious, ribs were amazing but Im giving 2 stars for the customer service. The place was empty few customers. The hostess sounded like she was bored or tired. Our waiter sounded and looked so mad she was bother when we ask her for more water. Thanks for the great food. Please improve your customer service"}
{"text":"Horrible. We won't be back & I can't believe we actually came back after last time! We went to Logan's tonight for some dinner. My fiancé had to order about 4 different drinks cause they were out of all 4 alcohols that he requested. I wanted a specific rum and they were out of that too!  Our waitress informed us that they have been out for a few days now.  Last time we were here we had an issue with getting our drinks. It took them 20 mins to get us our drinks. This place is just a ticking time bomb. I have no hopes for it being open for much longer."}
{"text":"I was really craving a steak and didn't feel like waiting over an hour at the keg. I have been here once or twice before and, although it's not the best steak in the world, it was always pretty decent for the price. This night in particular I didn't even get to have a steak. I ordered my steak rare because I prefer it a true medium rare and most places like this tend to over cook the steak. My first steak was almost a medium well and my second steak was literally raw! Like not even cooked would've killed me if I ate it raw! I asked for the dressing on my salad on the side which it was not it was nothing but dressing barely edible. Our server never wrote our order down pretty sure that was part of the problem. Bad service plus bad food = a one star review"}
{"text":"2nd time here, 2nd time a disappointment!  I like my steaks medium well and both times I get steaks cooked well done that are like shoe leather.  Really?  A steak joint that doesn't know how to cook steak?  Yep!  I also ordered a 16 ounce and think I was short changed a few ounces.  Service was good but when I complained about the above and showed the manager the over cooked steak, I am not sure she cared.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"You know, I really love the food here, but had the worst service ever tonight. I don't know if it was based on age, being a young adult, or out of pure laziness on the server'a behalf, but she never asked how our food was or if we wanted more bread. The only time she came over is when we had to call her over and then when she came over and said \"do you want me to split the check?\" And then put it on the table, without asking if we even wanted dessert. I mean, being the unruly teenagers we obviously are, we don't have money to spend on dessert.  I was honestly just appalled at the lack of service."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of most chains. But once in a while I take a step on the franchise side.   Great step tonight.    Mac at the bar was a delight. Good recommendations on food and great recommendations on drinks. And on top of all that he was friendly even though he was born in upstate NY. can't hold that against him. (Not to say the same for his parents)  Then to top off the night a fire ball shot.    So as many times I write, it's all about service.   .........,,,,,  I would visit any establishment where Mac is conducting the fun."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up I tried it and I had a great experience. The steak was great and the service was too! After about 6 months the service was lacking and the quality of the food wasnt close to what it was before. I think the concentration was more on getting out the booze than getting out good food."}
{"text":"I used to love Logans roadhouse but tonight along with the last few times the service was mediocre at best and the food was terrible. I ordered a Logan and it was a good medium but very bland. It was supposed to be 11oz but was less than 8 if I had to guess. Very disappointed in a place that used to be great...sad."}
{"text":"My hamburger steaks was rare rather than medium.  The manager took it back to cook some more.  When it came back, it looked a little browner where I had cut into it, but on inspection much of it was still dark pink - definitely too rare for hamburger.   Apparently the whole plate was just microwaved for a while.  The veggies were all dried out and crusty.  Inedible.  I am reluctant to send food back the first time, but didn't feel that a second time would end up good.   I just got it to go.  oh well...  The dog will be happy."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Logans the other day. Our server was Sarah H. A darling young lady.  This was one of the best servers we have ever had. She was so polite, courteous, fast service, and attentive to our needs. The food was good, hot and fresh. The rolls are to die for!!!  I just thought our server was terrific and thought I would say so, we obviously left her a well deserved generous tip.  Thanks Sarah H. :)"}
{"text":"The whole throw the peanut shells on the ground didn't do it for me. I rather have an area that is clean so I don't have to feel the peanut shells when sitting at my table/booth.   Otherwise the food was excellent. For twenty dollars I got a delicious steak with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. The gravy was on point. The Mac and cheese was also creamy and delicious. My steak was a little overcooked, but still pretty damn good.   The dinner rolls they serve complimentary are amazingly fluffy and served at the perfect temperature. The dinner rolls are up there with some of the best rolls I've ever had.   The service was superb even though the place was packed. All in all I had a great experience."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today with my sister and had a decent experience. This wasn't our first choice because Outback and Carraba's were not yet open and this was the next closest option and we were hungry. We were seated right away and our server came right over. Our drink orders were taken and came out very quickly along with rolls and butter.  I ordered a southwest style chicken salad (I can't remember the exact name on the menu) but it had blackened chicken, tortilla strips, black beans and corn and I ordered ranch on the side. I was very tasty and the chicken was seasoned well and tasted great. Our waiter was very attentive and gave great service. My sister had the soup of the day which was the baked potato soup and said it was great.   I would give this place another try for dinner. A steak or burger could be a much different experience than a salad so I may have more to report on a different occasion. Overall good first impression."}
{"text":"While driving from South Carolina back home to Pennsylvania, my husband and I had a craving for Logan's Roadhouse. Since the closest one to our home is over an hour away, we decided to stop mid-way through our 10 hour drive for lunch at this location in North Carolina.  Logan's did not disappoint! Our waitress was a very sweet older woman who did a great job of checking on us a lot without being overbearing. First come the yeast rolls. Oh. My. Gosh. I just crave these fluffy, sweet, and buttery morsels! We ate a ton of these rolls (I'm not revealing a number) and both ordered Caesar salads, Sirloin steaks, and sweet potatoes. I think our bill was something ridiculously low, like $25. The quantity and quality of food was definitely greater than the cost."}
{"text":"The place was too busy, the service was mediocre, as well as the food, this time. I'd try the location at Dobson Riverview."}
{"text":"Had a large family gathering here last night. Service was OK. Kitchen was a bit slow. Steak was 1/3 inedible grizzle. No attempt to remedy the issue by restaurant. Very disappointed by that. If you are a \"Steakhouse\" this should NEVER happen."}
{"text":"We went here because of great past experience at another location in SC & PA.  It's really easy to get to off I 85.  The place has a country theme/style restaurant. They do have the peanuts to snack on while waiting for service and/or food!  They make some of the best Mix drinks that I've found! There Long Island's are to dye for; I was also impressed that they had Yuengling Lager, a nice smooth Lager.  Ok back to Logan's, we must have had a new service; he was reserved and not sure of the menu, which was a little disappointed. I'm not sure if they were understaffed, didn't look like, but he keep going to takeout room a lot.  The servers do back each other really well, so there was always someone there to help you.   The food was cooked to order which was hot, fresh and good! No complaints with Food.    I would recommend Logan's, they have a great menu, usually friendly staff, awesome mixed drinks and good selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Logan's has great food but very weak margaritas. We ordered the onion tower which was delicious. The onions were heavily coated with breading and fried perfectly. It came with two dipping sauces. They also bring you complimentary buns with butter, and peanuts are also on the table. My husband got the cheeseburger with fried cheese, which he said was amazing. It looked good. I ordered the anything and everything salad. I was surprised how good of quality the ingredients were. The chicken was thick and juicy. My sons kids cheeseburger meal was a disappointment and totally an afterthought on the restaurants part. The hamburger was the size of a sausage patty and it came on one of the buns they serve you as an appetizer. Lastly, I ordered a moonshine margarita and it was the weakest margarita I ever had. I question if there was even any alcohol in it. If it weren't for my sons meal and the margarita I would have given this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"My Sister-In-Law and I have lunch here frequently and always order the Anything and Everything salad.  Delicious mix of greens,hard-boiled egg, dried cranberries, candied walnuts for some extra crunch, topped off with moist grilled chicken and balsamic vinagrette.  Very good and satisfying.  Delicious homemade rolls with honey butter accompany every meal and the servers are always friendly and attentive.  I am sure we will continue to come here for our lunchtime tradition."}
{"text":"I really do like this place. I always find the service to be very good to excellent and I think it provides a good value for the money. We typically go once a month and I have never left unhappy.  Generally I get the prime rib or a rib eye. Once or twice the prime rib was a little fatty, but other than that it has always been really good."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, we were seated right away. Not so loud that you can't visit. I appreciate that! They send me great coupons via email, which the waitress took w/o any problem. I had a small steak, cooked to perfection, and others ordered the shrimp and chicken, which they enjoyed. The side salads are fresh and cold. Rolls are served warm and refilled. The steamed broccoli and baked potatoes not overcooked like they have been sitting for hours, but just right. A strawberry lemonade in a mason jar was divine, very refreshing and pretty with fresh fruit to see. I like that we never wait long, the food is consistent and they seem to be glad to have your business. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious here for my first ever visit. The complimentary buttery rolls are huge and I had to force myself to not eat more than two because they are so good. My BBQ ribs fell off the bone and tasted great and fresh. I swear they put cinnamon and sugar on the sweet potato fries because they tasted incredible. even the broccoli tasted amazing! Dipped in some kind of lemon pepper sauce. I was impressed! They took two coupons and we even got a free dessert for a birthday. It can be a little pricey depending on what you get so I wouldn't come back without a coupon, but I'm just cheap like that. They have big screen TVs and a fun country/bar atmosphere. I like throwing peanuts on the ground."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour on a Saturday night. Drinks were great, food was just okay. Had the fried mushrooms, but really got more breading and grease than anything else. I sat at the bar and service was alright, we never got the bread they normally serve after you order. May come back to Logans again but for sure it will be this one!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Logans Roadhouse one more time.  We can both say, WE ARE GLAD WE DID.  The service was excellent and the food was a lot better this time. While there was a slight hiccup, we want to return. Our server Laura was nice, pleasant, and was able to recommend sides for my wife that she really liked.   The time from order to eat was faster this time. While I had to get my steak refired, it was worth the wait.  Come over at lunch a gave a great meal at a great price. Ask for Laura as your server"}
{"text":"We were referred here by   close friend. Said the wings were \"fantastic\". We got some and they were just okay. The salad was also \"okay\" it had cucumbers on it that were transparent (not the Netflix series), these had been frozen or something. The place was packed with a huge line by the time we left. It is like a giant lodge of tourists, retirees, and kids sitting at the bar. Parents, don't seat your cute little kids at the bar. They will get comfortable there and you will find them in the exact same spot twenty years later with smoker's lines and a drinking problem. The bread was good, fresh baked doughy rolls that we couldn't eat because we are anti-carb. Steaks was okay, grilled shrimp was \"okay\", but we don't pay this much to go out and have  \"okay\", do we???"}
{"text":"Shocked.  We have never had a bad steak here.  No matter what temp...medium rare to well, we have always had a good meal.  Until now.  Steaks so tough, we couldn't chew them.  Service was not up to par.  Must have been an off night. ??"}
{"text":"Strawberry lemonade was TERRIBLE: the first one had a shot of sprite soda in it, so she brought me another one.  I then had to ask for a whole bowl of lemons in order to attempt to make it taste like lemonade... nope.  Didn't help.  As a server, I would have maybe asked if there was anything else I could do or get for a customer who was clearly displeased with the drink.  I ordered a sirloin/rib combo.  The sirloin was a bad cut, but everything else on the plate was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Hostess ? told us she would get the manager and asked for our name.  I was confused, didn't know why she had to get the manager so I asked if there was a wait.  She tells us no, but wants our name to seat us and has to get the manager.   I give her my name and we wait about 5 minutes to be seated and she comes back and seats us. What just happened?  Our server eventually makes it to our table, takes our drink order after I inquire about how they make their Bourbon Sours here.  Silly me, I want it like the old school Whiskey Sour with that maraschino cherry sunk in the bottom.  She's not sure if they include that but she's gonna add it per my request. Don't ask me why but I was in the mood for a classic cocktail.  Something my Mom or Dad might have drank back in the 50's or 60's. Here ya go: 1 1/2 ounces whiskey (or bourbon, Scotch, Canadian whiskey, or Irish whiskey) 4 ounces sour mix, recipe follows Crushed ice 1 maraschino cherry Combine the whiskey and sour mix in a large old-fashioned glass with ice. Stir, garnish with cherry, and serve. Sour Mix:  1-ounce lemon juice 1-ounce sugar 2 ounces water Combine lemon juice and sugar, then dilute with water and stir to dissolve sugar  My cocktail arrived and was more reminisce of bourbon with bar sour mix.   It was okay, but not what I had hoped for.  Dinner was a veggie plate combo for me and my husband ordered the ribs. Server brings over dinner rolls and our salads.  Dinner rolls were darker than usual and they were hard.  So hard that I thought there was a greater risk to my teeth than what I might experience from biting an apple. I am not exaggerating. Our server came by again, not to check on us but to apologize because there were no more ribs and she wanted to find out what other entrée my husband would like. So he orders up the Chicken Fried Steak and she thought he might want to change his sides but he opted to leave that the same. I also asked if we could get some fresh rolls and she then apologized for the quality of what was initially delivered to the table because the current batch was in the oven. No worries, when they're done we'd like to have a couple. When our meals are finally delivered a basket of rolls are brought along with.   Hot, Hot, Hot dinner rolls.  Burning hot.  So hot I cut it with my knife and fork so it would cool off a bit. But oh they were soft and much easier to eat.    Overall our server was pleasant. The food was okay.   The cocktail was okay. The water was horrible -or maybe it was my glass. I wouldn't opt to go there again anytime soon.  It was only because I had a gift card did we opt to go there and use it. I think we'll stick with one of the other steak and ribs restaurants next time."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with the family.  Recently went with a large group that included my sons who are 6 & 9.  My boys both had the popcorn shrimp off of the kids menu and all of the adults had steak, pork or chicken. Kids got very very sick within 15-20 minutes of eating and could barely walk out on their own.  When I attempted to call management to make sure no one else got sick, some girl answering the phone (giggling the whole time) said she was a manager and \"oops,\" did I want the General Manager to call back tomorrow, I said yes and you guessed it I've never heard from anyone.   Don't chance it. Food is overpriced and below average, not very flavorful just drowend in bbq sauce, Not cooked correctly, gave my children horrible food poisoning, servers are not always good they tend to just disappear.   Much better places at better prices!"}
{"text":"This is a typical mid range steakhouse. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was good, not overwhelming. The chili was actually really good. Our server was great, we had a party of 8 with separate checks and she did a great job getting everything correct. We were seated quickly and got our drinks shortly thereafter. Great location, close to the highway and convenient to other stores / shops."}
{"text":"Brought my family here for dinner.  The first table we were brought to was set up but all the chairs had something wet and sticky on them.  Hostesses were lost on what to do.  Open tables were everywhere but they hadn't been bussed. When we got a table we all ordered the Ribeye.  Steak cook perfect but bad cut left the steak on our plates in the form of gristle..  All through the meal we watched the buss staff the hostess stand at the front counter and hang out..  Food OK..  Unprofessional staff..  Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"One of our favorites in the San Tan Village area.  You'll never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, and fantastic service. This was our first visit, and it won't be our last. Our neighbors invited to join them. We had 4 adults and 3 kids ages 5-7. We were seated at a nice round table, which worked out really well. Our server Gianna was Amazing! Her drink recommendations to the ladies was spot on, they really enjoyed them. Waters, sodas, and cocktails never sat empty. Any special request that were made to the food entree's were exact. We were checked on my the chef and manager to make sure our dinners were good. We really enjoyed ourselves!!!"}
{"text":"This time around had the meatloaf and it was much better then anything I have ever had here. The mushrooms and grilled onions were the icing on the cake - oh and I LOVE their rolls they give you before the meal!  Much better experience this time around!"}
{"text":"Ribeye baked potato were great and no peoblens splinting meal Nice wait staff  Front of house needs ATTENTION Outside trash and landscaping   Inside lobby dirty   Power wash daily"}
{"text":"I came here solo, so my expectations were low -  and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great. I ordered a beer and some magical burger with bacon and fried cheese (though I skip the sauce) and I think this is the best burger ever. The waitress check back periodically and is kind as can be. As a northerner I expect things to be fast and perfect the first time and I was not one bit disappointed. If I'm ever back in Kannapolis I'll also be back at Logan's."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been talking about Logan's. We drove 23 miles to Mesa total of 46 miles round trip! Just to find out they no longer serve a porterhouse steak at Logan's anymore! WTF? But it was a long drive there so of course we stayed. So started off with the bread as usual an fried schrooms. Always good!!!! So had to change up since they no longer have my steak. Got the rib eye instead. Had a little more charred cow bubble gum (fat) than i liked! But was a good steak! Had sauteed mushrooms an brisket baked beans and a blackberry lemonade which was very good! She had fish and fries! Alex was our server and was very good! Always came by right on time to see if we needed anything. Besides the fact a roadhouse dont sell a porterhouse steak anymore!!! It was very good!!!"}
{"text":"20 oz prime rib is excellent medium rare. It was the thickest, juiciest, tastiest prime rib we've ever had hands down.  Good enough for 3 adults to share with extra sides. Pair with Louis M. Martini cab - Sonoma County 2013... pure joy.  The grilled veggies skewer was seasoned and grilled perfectly; also mac n cheese was great.  Excellent service by Bobby on Friday night and Joe on Sunday night (yes it was so good we came back and ordered exactly the same thing after 2 days!). Appetizers: fried mushrooms & fried pickles... Fried...yum...need I say more?  We didn't have room for dessert but have my heart set on the chocolate peanut butter mud pie. Must save room next time :D"}
{"text":"Great customer service we have Tony he is so welcoming and tooked good care of us...Great food tasty and fresh.... Tony you are awesome definately will be back :) great customer service....."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR THE BEST LOGAN'S ROADHOUSE!!  Our drinks were always refilled.  The waiter was incredibly attentive.  The food was amazing & for the price you just couldn't beat it!  We absolutely can't say enough about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were driving around Riverview and my wife happen to spot a sign on the window that said '2 Meals for $20 on Tuesday and Wednesday'. Since it was close to dinner time, we decided to try it.  I had the Mesquite wood grilled Pork Chop which was 1 pork chop with baked potato and apple sauce.  Since I just had a tub of popcorn from Cinemark, the 1 chop was dry and salty. The baked potato was smothered with butter and sour cream. I had to scrape half of that off. Mayo Clinic says 'If you want to cut down on your salt intake, eat at HOME'. I forgot what my wife had since it's been a month since our visit."}
{"text":"This place gets extra points because of Tim ! They got throwed rolls, strawberry storm in mason jar, and peanuts on the floor. Once in a while, you gotta hit up the roadhouse and tie one on.  Oops! I forgot to mention that the food was also delightful! I asked for a roumalade to go with the fish and chips I ordered and they did not know what I meant but they were so helpful.  Turns out that they do have it but they just call it sauce."}
{"text":"Easily the best happy hour (3pm to 6pm EVERY DAY) menu in town! Awesome drinks and the best food for cheap! We get the 2 meals for $14 with drinks and an appetizer and usually have the total bill around $25!  Excellent service and awesome buttered rolls! We come here often and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Slow service, mediocre food. We had to send the prime rib back twice, it was like shoe leather. The waitress didn't seem to care much about the food being overcooked and didn't refill our drinks at all. Overpriced for what it is. The peanuts were great, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was a little late on a Friday night and wanted to get a nice small salad to help balance my earlier indulgence at lunch from work.  My wife and I were greeted at the door with a sign that stated \" due to maintenance issues Yeast Rolls were not available. \" .......What? NO YEAST ROLLS!!!!  We opted to stay, and was promptly greeted by our server.  He stated he would do his best and make sure we had everything we needed.......I promptly replied I wanted yeast rolls.  He did offer the ingredients needed to make the yeast rolls, but due to the  limited time available, I still would not have yeast rolls....... we laughed, and all was in good humor.  The salad was a side salad, no tomatoes, no onions, with a touch of bacon.  I have added a photo.  Upon looking at the menu, the Ribeye Steak sandwich sounded really appealing.  It is a 6 oz ribeye steak on a bun, but I requested no lettuce or tomato.  It was a pretty thick cut with a slice of cheese with a side of fries.  I have also added a photo.  With larger chains, one needs to understand that they will have good nights and bad nights.  With the exception of the yeast rolls, this night was good, the food was good, and the server was very attentive.  The four stars is for the salad, it was spot on, and was exactly what I wanted, a good small side salad on a cold plate.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time. I was very impressed. The food was awesome everyone loved their meals. I got the roadhouse burger and hubs got the buttermilk chicken. And the rolls.. so good!! Large portions which was awesome, I love leftovers. And the service was great! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The fried foods were on the greasy side but the service was fabulous and so were the burgers!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give Logan's a try, due to the fact that Texas Roadhouse is not open for early lunch. Peanuts were stale, rolls were cold and tasted old. We got the wings appetizer and they were good so we had hope our lunch would be delicious .... however it was NOT. We got the club sandwich, the bread was so hard and stale I could barley bite into it. My dad got the gumbo, it was barley warm and looked like it was a week old. My mom got the grilled chicken salad, the chicken was cold and rubbery and my boyfriend got a burger and chips, the chips were SOOO greasy and burnt to the point they were almost black. We called over the manager to let her know that 3 out of the 4 of us could not even eat our food. She asked if we wanted something else but at that point we were just over it. She said she would adjust the bill, however when we got the check she took only $10 off ..... which wasn't even one full meal. We had a full table of uneaten food and had to leave the restaurant hungry but still ended up paying $50. HORRIBLE experience will never go back."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say some days you just can't win. My husband and I stopped in for a good steak and we were both disappointed at the quality of the steaks. We both ordered the TBone. They were at best a qtr  inch thick. I like my steak med rare and my husband's is med well. When we got them they were both very well done as I said they were so thin that it is almost impossible to get a med rare. Anyways they took both steaks back and returned shortly with 2 new steaks. His was fine; mine on the other hand was pretty rare but I ate it anyway. The steak had good flavor but man the amount of  and veining just made it so tough to really enjoy eating. I really hope this was just an off night because I have eaten at Logan's in different states and the quality of the steaks were much better. Guess we'll see the next."}
{"text":"They get 5 out of 5 starts for their Monday - Wednesday SUPER AWESOME 2 meals for $14.99 deal!  That is right, kiddos, ALL DAY -- not just limited to lunch.  My co-worker and I have become weekly regulars and the staff is always polite, nice, and considerate.  If there is ever a problem, they quickly correct it and are very receptive to special requests.   Seriously, where else can you get a steak dinner for $7.50 each AND get to throw peanuts on the floor without your mom yelling at you or you having to clean them up!?  Also, the unlimited, free, hot, buttery, melt-y, and delicious sweet dinner rolls are AMAZING!  (note: do not check calorie content of the rolls before visiting.... it will ruin the pure bliss enjoyed while devouring the rolls).  Also, you can opt for healthier options here much easier than you can a burger place (salad, chicken or steak, and steamed broccoli easily does the trick!)  Overall, even without the super amazing deal Monday - Friday, I enjoy this place and will continue to go back.  (p.s. did I mention the free rolls!?)"}
{"text":"Logan's is not a bad place to eat for dinner & also not a bad place to pull up a seat at the bar. It's a steakhouse type setting, but still on the reasonable price side.  I would suggest heading here for lunch & not dinner, considering they only have dinner sized entrees that are not priced appropriately for a lunch visit. The food here is pretty good though, especially if you like red meat. I'm a big fan of their burgers & ribs and mainly stick to those two.  As for the bar area, it's a great idea if you're looking to grab up a quick seat during the dinner crowd. It's 1st come 1st served so if you can get a booth in here then you won't have to wait on the list. If you head to the bar after dinner hours, you'll get your regulars pulled up around the bar. They have some pretty good specials & it's really not a bad place for a relaxing bar atmosphere.  In Gastonia, if you head out to a chain restaurant during the typical dinner hours, expect to have to wait to be seated. Logan's is no exception, but they do have free peanuts that help pass the time. Dinner is a good option here if you're looking for a hearty red meat meal & spending a little time at the bar after dinner isn't a bad idea either."}
{"text":"We sat 10 minutes before getting a server to take our drink order. (I had to complain to hostess just to get that). Then it was at least an hour before we got our food after finally getting to order! The rest of the service was just as terrible as the food! The manager did came over (at the end of our dinner) he never offered any sort of compensation for our suffering. We'll never be back!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this review. I have been here on multiple occasions, because this is Bae's family's favorite restaurant. On one of the occasions I ordered chicken fried steak with brown gravy. Call me weird but I like my brown gravy. They brought me chicken fried chicken with brown gravy, when I asked to have it corrected they brought me chicken fried steak with white gravy. Tonight we took the oldest for her 15th birthday. We made it a point to say \"birthday girl\" in front of the waiter several times but he failed to even say Happy Birthday let alone do the whole birthday dessert deal. The youngest had the kids meal, which comes with a drink. She ordered the special lemonade with no refills. We were charged the full price and she was never offered the drink that came with the meal. When we pointed that out, our waiter said \"well, I brought her a water\". To top it all off, I ordered a $5.25 drink off the back of the cocktail menu. The receipt came out $7.50 because \"that's the happy hour menu\" which nowhere even indicated it's happy hour.  He was really attentive, but his flippant reaction to our questions on the unexpectedly overpriced bill was disappointing. As we were trying to leave he hovered a foot a way so he could grab the bill, which is such a major faux pas and rude."}
{"text":"Let's just say the price is right 2 for 1 meals \"is good\".  Our waitress Melissa seemed to be nice....well at 1st anyway.  When she came to take our order she was rushed, couldn't be bothered with any ???? or anything else NO PERSONALITY WHAT SO EVER !!! down to business \"Oh did I mention it was NOT busy at all at this time.  The outside of this restaurant has gone way downhill since opening weeds everywhere no curb appeal what so ever \"in fact it could look closed\".    NEEDS ATTENTION FROM CORPORATE, Managers obviously don't care !!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?  I love the hot bread they give you while you wait for food, love the Santa Fe Talapia and the steak special is pretty good here too.  This is a great casual spot with peanuts all over the place, good service, and not to pricey.   I like bringing the kids here too more so than Red Robin next door since its fun for them and the food is 100% better."}
{"text":"Tonight (6-27-2015) should have been a great night out, but it was not.  The restaurant itself was lacking in pretty much every measurable category, even the waiter was clearly having a lousy night as well (his attitude was less than hospitable).  Mens Restroom:  I've seen cleaner outhouses and port-o-pottys.  One toilet looked like somebody assploded, the other looked as though it came from a frat house.  A staff member was notified, but when we left the problem had still not been addressed.  Food:  1) Steaks had no char on them and were not cooked at a sufficient enough temperature to break apart the fat and make the steak tender and enjoyable.  Grilling steak is not difficult and it's a shame to see beef treated with such disrespect. 2) Salads were just awful.  The lettuce was bitter, tomatoes were flavorless, and the steak was well, gross.  I don't know how they managed to do this, but they found a way so I guess that earns points for going the extra fail mile. 3) Of our 4 sides, 3 were delivered and 1 was edible (corn).  Kitchen Management (we were sitting right next to the kitchen): The man doing quality control (manager?) on the food before it went out did some things that I thought was a bit questionable.  A dish was about to go out, but it was missing the fries.  He took some fries off of another order and put them on that dish, but did not replace those fries taken from the other order.  Really?  You're going to short change someone some fries?  On several different orders, I saw food fall off of the plate onto the stainless steel counter.  Rather than replace the food, the manager just put the food back on the plate.  Once he \"dusted it off\" and another time \"blew it off\" neither of which is likely to pass a food inspection.  Several other times, it was just put back on the plate.  No gloves mind you, just bare hands.  Everybody has off days and this may well be one of those times.  Personally, I have no desire to come back and find out."}
{"text":"Went once, not impressed at all. Had a rude trailer trash looking waitress that ignored us 95% of our meal, and our food was burnt and cold when we FINALLY got it. I had heard good things about this place, and after my experience there... I really don't know why people like it. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We love Logan's. We eat there 2-3 times a month. Their Mon-Wed special, 2 meals for $14.99 is a GREAT deal. If you just drink water with your meal you can eat there for under $20 for two people and eat steak and salmon. YUM! Love their service and their rolls are awesome."}
{"text":"Took my son there for his birthday. We all ordered sirloin which came out perfectly cooked, even if they made us cut our steaks to check. I don't like to cut my steak until I am ready to eat it. Sides were good, drinks were full. Son had the birthday brownie which he shared with the five of us. The brownie was over the top! We will definitely be back.  UPDATE: rumor has it that they are permanently closed ? Call ahead to be sure. If anyone knows for sure feel free to reply."}
{"text":"So...  Full...   The portions are great, the rolls are even better...  Can't stop coming to this place...   Try the meatloaf!  and btw - don't be afraid of the Veggie Skewers...  They are awesome!"}
{"text":"Portions are a little small. My steak was under cooked. Service was good, but they try to fill you up on peanuts and bread"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service.  Decent food - when and if they get it right.  We had a bad first experience here.  The general manager sent me free coupons to entice us to return.  When we did, the meal and service was so bad the manager gave us (5 adults) the entire meal for free.  Here I was to use my coupons because of the bad experience and I couldn't use them because it was worse than the first trip!!!  Our appetizer actually came out AFTER the meal.  Plus tons of other issues.  If you want good service, DON'T GO HERE.  If you want free peanuts - this is the place."}
{"text":"Food was okay.    To the staff: 1) If it is happy hour let me know when I order and could have saved a little money.   2) Please refill my water while I am eating."}
{"text":"went with my daughter for dinner we ate at the bar the chicken tenders were pretty good I liked the breading my daughter had a cheeseburger she enjoyed it the bartender was outstanding with service he made me a rum and strawberry drink really tasty it helped to take the edge off to go Walmart shopping Ill go back there"}
{"text":"It's a chain. It's got the schtick that makes chains appealing to the masses. But the food was good and while I wanted to eat a lot of the \"bad stuff\" that smelled great, I was on a highly restricted diet. It's increasingly rare (and much appreciated) when I can go and eat something tasty, at an affordable price and find an option or two on the menu that fits some of the weird dietary restrictions with which I've been living."}
{"text":"We were placed in the back corner of the restraunt and were given awful service! They forgot about my sisters salad, and never checked in on us! After being slow the whole time they were quite quick to give us the check and let us pay! Texas Roadhouse is a cheaper, friendlier, and more tasteful option! Over priced and not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I've always had great meals at this Logan's location - better than other locations in fact.  Tonight was a little disappointing though.  Two of us had sirloins which were not great - I realize that sirloins are not the greatest cut, but they've always been nice and tender here - a little tough tonight.  My sweet potato was a little hard on one side.  The salads were a third the size they once were, but the dressing was great.  The thousand island was probably the best I've had.  The rolls were a little over cooked, but still good, just not great.  The other couple had ribeyes and said they were very tasty.  The service was good.  The meal wasn't horrible, just not as good as what I've come to expect here."}
{"text":"My steak was prepared as I ordered it, but it was barely warm when served. I ordered the 6 oz. Mesquite grilled sirloin. It was tough and had little flavor. The baked potato likewise was served lukewarm. The butter only partially melted most likely because the plate had been sitting on the line under warming lights too long. Not going back."}
{"text":"Today was my wife and my first trip trying out Logan Steakhouse. We decided to give it a chance after getting some coupons in the mail offering a pretty significant discount. The prices really weren't bad at all. The food itself wasn't bad either. My wife got the Ultimate Trio, which was a pretty good bargain for all you get with it and she was very satisfied. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken.  It was pretty good too, however the one I got was a little too rubbery for my liking and a tad undercooked. However, once I told our waitress, Cosette, she absolutely went above and beyond to make it right, as did her coworker Summer and the manager Jessica. I understand sometimes, mistakes happen to even the best of them, and I applaud these three ladies for making absolute certain that they fixed the situation/mistake. Got a new order of the same thing, and it was cooked to a tee and tasted fantastic. What really stood out to me at Logans was the above mentioned customer service. Cossette, Summer and Jessica made my wife and I feel like valued customers and went out of their way to make the experience a great one. Because of them, we will be coming back again. Thanks ladies and Logan's!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here thinking of what I should say about the customer service I'm receiving after my steak was over cooked twice.  The food itself is overall good...I.e the rolls, fried mushroom, and the salad, however the steaks aren't the best quality and the taste show it and cooks must not be trained on the different temp to cook the steaks too.   I felt very ignored by the management (Angie) while waiting another 20 minutes for my steak to come once again. I was offered my Luke cooled potato as I sat waiting once again.  When it came to the table it was still overcooked again the management took it back to be re-cooked. The 3rd steak was better when it arrived. At this point I was very irritable so I asked for the steak to go. The management did take care of my ticket however my daughter steak was overcooked and had to be sent back as well. To my surprise the management did not take care of her ticket. Now I am not a person that want anything for free. I am willing to pay for what I eat but make no mistake I am not willing to pay for poor service and over cooked food. I felt the management could have handled this situation as they did with other non black customers that sat there for a short wait and was complimentary desserts.  I felt making the drive from Charlotte to Monroe in traffic wasn't worth it after the horrible service I was given from management. The waiter however was cordial and try to make the best out of a bad situation.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy schmancy steak joint.  If you want romantic candlelight date night atmosphere, this place ain't it. I've been coming here for a few months and it's become my favorite steakery because they pay attention to detail.  I know this because of their asparagus.  It does not require advanced skills to produce a quality steak if you have a decent piece of meat to start with.  However, it's easy to flub asparagus, which is why I use it as a litmus test.  They passed the asparagus test. However, they failed the bonus round (lobster), but that's OK because no restaurant in AZ has passed the lobster test with me.  The restaurant that could pass muster would be overly pretentious and chock full of gluten, so no thanks, I'd rather be comfy..."}
{"text":"Give it up for Mack !! !! Best Service all around , timely , personable, and great quality food and dranks ! Thank you Mack . even though we didnt make it for the Thursday speacial lol...next time tho!"}
{"text":"They don't have lettuce buns for burgers. Only \"no bun\" and you don't get extra lettuce.   The waiter was great and very attentive, but the food wasn't good at all. I got one of the salads that has avocado on it. The avocado was rock hard and still have the pit skin attached to it."}
{"text":"The best part about Logan's is the rolls - and I don't mind that you do not need to add butter because it is already dripping with butter. YUM! I can taste a hint of beer in the roll as well...or it could just be yeast..or wishful thinking. I am trying to be healthier, so I went with the salad and water. The anything-and-everything salad does have some good items included - craisins, pecans, egg, grilled chicken and a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing...but still it was a salad. Maybe I should have ordered the grilled streak salad...but the peanuts are a free appetizer and you can throw them on the floor. What fun! The sweet tea is outstanding and reminds me of my days in Atlanta.  Another review commented about the similarity between Logan's and Texas Roadhouse. They are very similar, but I wouldn't say Logan's is a knock off. Plus Logan's was started in 1991 to Texas Roadhouse's 1993, so perhaps they are the ones being imitated?  Come in for a sweet tea, free peanuts and the excellent rolls. The rest is about your average steakhouse. Two salads, one tea and a water - $22."}
{"text":"Very nice place. CJ is a very nice server and me and my hubby love coming here when we have been out all day shopping."}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't know where to go eat Monday night, but I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place.  As soon as we walked in, I thought of Texas Roadhouse.  The hostess said we are better than them.  I was skeptical at first, til our server came by and then we got our food.  WOW!  Server Lino was really great and was always laughing and smiling.  Everyone there was very helpful with our first time there.  The manager even came up to ask us how we were doing.  The food was amazing.  The sampler app was really good.  The buffalo chicken tenders were so tender and tasty.  Mmmm  We both had the same thing.  Steak, loaded sweet potato, and mac n cheese.  Everything was amazing.  We went for the meal for two for $14.99, BUT decided on something else.  The bill came out over $50 with tip, but it was worth it.  We ended up there during happy hour and my hubby got a few draft beers for $2.99 each.  It was really romantic.  I highly recommend this place to singles, couples, and families!!"}
{"text":"Best service, food, prices and all over atmosphere. I'm so sad to hear that they are all AZ locations are shutting down. You'll be missed"}
{"text":"We went to Logan's Roadhouse as a recommendation from someone when we got there the waitress was at the table asking for a drink immediately as we sat down I guess this is a good thing although they have a 5 page menu for drinks it was kind of hard to decide what we want it right then and there. As the waitress brought the drinks too as she insisted on taking the order right away so we gave her our order I had their chicken southwest salad and my husband had a steak. They brought our food out almost instantly they brought my husband's salad with his dinner the waitress brought my husband one more drink and then disappeared I was never asked on how anything was and come to find out she gave me the wrong salad so when she did come to the table with her bill she said will there be anything else tonight and I said well you gave me the wrong salad. She said oh I'm sorry would you like your bill. I said you gave me the wrong salad and then on the bill you charged me for the wrong salad so you gave me the more expensive salad which I did not order could you at least take the difference in price of seeing you didn't try to compensate the salad was very disappointed because I was told very high reviews of this place after a very long day and waiting and trying to find this place and getting there to find out that service just was not there was very disappointing. Good service does not mean run to the table take drinks and Order and never come back just something to think about management it's up to you and what you have your girls do maybe get them off the cell phones and get them on the floor spending time with their guests will be a much better thing"}
{"text":"I went there with my friends family and it was a nice place.  Very casual.  I had a way too large margarita yikes.  Our waiter Jimmy was very nice and when I told him he would be packing up my leftovers he obliged.  I was just practicing my flirting skills.  I guess it worked.  My shrimp was just ok, but my friends meal and her husbands (which they let me taste), were fantastic.  Great sautéed mushrooms, salmon...the hots rolls with cinnamon butter are REDIC amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped by Logan's for dinner.  There were four of us.  Our server was wonderful.  Everything was in a timely, friendly manner.  Between us we had the meat plate and 3 orders of their steak offerings.  It was all delicious and cooked perfect.  The seasoning on the steak was delicious.  The salads were good too.  Our server was attentive.  She was there filling drinkings and bringing items as needed.  I'm guessing we will definitely return before we head out of this area."}
{"text":"Someone please remind me not to ever go to one of these \"family style\" steakhouses again.  I just keep forgetting and thinking that it will be different, and it never is (well, a few things are, but it's always bad)!  First, I was meeting people, so I got there and they were already seated, with drinks, menus and rolls.  You would think that I would have seen the server within a minute or two.  You'd be wrong.  It was easily fifteen minutes before he even came by to say that it would be a while before he came back by.  When he did, it was like we were accosted giving orders, and it was our fault for not wanting anything additional - just trying to get the whole process moving.  Then it was another good while before the order was taken, and a while after that before drinks were refreshed, rolls were refilled, etc.  When the food finally arrived, we were almost stuffed from peanuts and rolls, not to mention annoyed at the Logan's \"Yee-ha!\" birthday yell throughout the room, but we did have some food to eat, and I'll say that the food itself was halfway decent, if way over-sized.  At least, it was decent until I found a piece of plastic in the au jus that came with my roast beef sandwich.  At least the rest of it was good.  Some other server - not even our own - reported the issue to the management or the cooks or someone, and something may or may not have been done.  We didn't receive an apology, a credit, a free dessert or anything.  They did offer to get me some more au jus, but I declined.  I just didn't think I wanted more of that.  While I was waiting, I did see the server at the next table, who apparently had just been to the rest room, since he had pee stains on his pants.  Nice touch.  A while later, we finally received the bill, a \"thanks for dropping by\" and managed to get the heck out of dodge.  Safe to say we won't be doing that again.  You can if you want, but I don't think I will."}
{"text":"Plenty of open seating but had to wait 10 minutes to be sat. Took another 15 minutes for our waiter to come and take our drink order. He apologized for the delay in bringing us WATER.  The glasses were so hot they broke...  He brought our drinks over without a tray and was using his sweaty body to lean the drinks against. Our table ordered two salads, a pork sandwich and I ordered entree side pulled pork sweet potato and mushroom skewers. 40 minutes later our food still had not arrived. Good thing the food was tasty or the entire visit would have been a bust."}
{"text":"My family loves Logan's Roadhouse.  It's a good option and I will tell you that I personally appreciate the large round booths just behind the hostess station for our family of five. Many restaurants try to pack us into a table for four with a chair on the end and Logan's has never suggested that so they get props for that!  That may seem like a small or minor thing but comfort is important in a restaurant experience.  So a big high five for the comfort of their restaurant.  The food.... My husband and son enjoy the prime rib when it's available and give it high marks.  I'd say that the food is good but not exceptional or anything that makes me yearn to get back here quickly but there are plenty of choices on the menu and the kids menu has quite a few options.  The atmosphere is positive.  We've always been promptly greeted and they do a good job of turning the tables quickly so your wait is minimized.  The servers we've had have always been pleasant m, efficient, knowledgeable, and attentive which is all I ask from a server.  All in all, a good option."}
{"text":"After a long business trip away from my family, we came here for dinner and Coco was the best server ever! The ribeyes being 1/2 off wasn't too shabby either."}
{"text":"Returned here a week ago for a friends' birthday dinner. The place was pretty barren, but for whatever reason we were seated near an \"odd\" family. Don't you hate that? When a restaurant has dozens of tables to choose from, but they seat you breathing distance from another table?   whatever  We were seated at a huge round table after most of our party got there, and got our drinks and orders taken pretty quickly. Our server was nice enough to bring a few pitches of water since that's all we were drinking. I ordered the hot chicks which were buffalo chicken pattie/things on yeast rolls with fries. I wasn't sure what yeast rolls were, but found out they're the rolls that you get pre-meal. Which was fine, but the rolls are super soft and I'm not sure if they complimented the hot chicks to their maximum potential.   Either way, I had enough to bring home leftovers. And for a little over $10 it wasn't a bad meal."}
{"text":"ordered the buffalo chicken wings.  asked for them to be fried hard.  They could have been cooked a little longer.  I ended up sick a couple of hours later."}
{"text":"Has no military discount. I tried to call in to make a reservation but the gentleman on the phone wasn't very polite, so I'm assuming their customer service isn't up to standards."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful! All the food was bland and tasteless. The steaks were dry and mealy, the waitress constantly kept saying, \"i don't know\" to everything we asked and she would only tell us the larger sized beers because she kept trying to up sell. Also they were out of medium rare prime rib, the mushrooms obviously came from a can, the potatoes were also dry and bland, and the au jus was some weird thick dark sauce. Don't go here, just go to Outback, its slightly cheaper and MUCH better quality."}
{"text":"Solid chain american steakhouse. If you're looking for a cheap steak this is your place. We went on a Friday night at 6, NO wait. Awesome lemonades hand shaken in a mason jar. I had the onion steak, frizzled onions on top of my steak on a bed of caramelized onions. Cooked a perfect medium rare. Great house salad, great unlimited bread. Girlfriend had the prime rib, average."}
{"text":"Ate at Logan's today with my boyfriend and his parents after we drove them to pick up a truck they were buying. I was happy to see that being Wednesday this location had the two meals for $13.99 deal. I ordered bbq chicken with a sweet potato and coleslaw, and my bf had the 6 oz sirloin with 1/2 rack of ribs added on. Oddly enough we switched because I was liking the steak more, and he had a taste for the chicken I ordered! The sweet potato with butter and cinnamon was perfect, and very big! Coleslaw ehh not so wonderful. Very bland even after shaking pepper for a few minutes (I will never add salt to anything!) so I didn't eat much of it.  The service overall was very nice. Although at first the hostess sat us at a small booth that could fit two comfortably even after we told her two more people were coming. So before my boyfriend's parents arrived we booth hopped to a six seater. If it had been lunch rush we would have dealt with the tiny top, but it was way past and we knew it wouldn't put any big groups on a waiting list. The bill came to around $40 and for four people that's impressive especially with the quality and quantity of food we had.  We will take advantage of the coupon left at our table for a buy one get one free meal on May 30th/June 1st for the Holiday."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. Ordered the Ribeye and the baked potato. The ribeye was great! My husband got the meatloaf and said it was great too. The dinner rolls very delicious and my caesar salad was fresh. We will defiantly be coming back soon :)"}
{"text":"I called on the phone to see if they had happy hour from 8pm-10pm and the nice lady said \"No, we have happy hour from 8 to close.\" I asked her what time they closed and she said \"10.\" Lol"}
{"text":"A really reasonably priced steakhouse that does just that, give you a good meal at a fair price. Never have a long wait to get seated and the staff always do a good job."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the salmon Cesar salad. Good prices. Great service. The ribeye sandwich is also a good choice for lunch. I like onions so I sometimes get the brewskie onion steak. Very taste with a side salad and sweet potato."}
{"text":"This place has me stuck with a sort of love/hate relationship. Seriously.   The food is usually pretty good, and there's quite a bit to choose from, but sometimes I've been disappointed on the food more than once, which is the crux of the problem.   For example, I've gotten mac and cheese that looks like it was taken out of a refrigerator and heated up, and tasted like it too. Absolutely disgusting and I would have been utterly ashamed to give it to a dog, much less a paying customer. Apparently the cooks and the waitstaff saw nothing wrong with it though until I pointed it out. On the plus side, they did fix the issue and bring me some much improved mac and cheese in short order.   The list goes on from there. I once ordered a chicken meal, asked for no rice since it comes on a bed of rice. Sure enough, I get it with the rice anyway. I try picking it out, but grow tired of it and send it back for another. Manager did apologize for it, but seemed annoyed that he had to do so.   What else? There was the time they brought my chicken out missing the peppercorn dressing stuff that goes on it. Pointed that out and they brought me a lukewarm mini-bowl of the stuff to put on myself. What the heck is that? Take it back and fix it properly, the customer doesn't do food prep if you expect a tip.  Also had a negligent server drop some kind of an ice pack onto the floor (we were seated by a drink and cashier station). Some kind of liquid splashed onto me and onto my food. Not only did the server (not our table's) not care, she left it on the floor where she dropped it, for other people to slip on, and walked off.   I will say, however, I have always loved the yeast rolls they have at this place. I am a sucker for them and can never get enough. They've never been a disappointment and are one of the reasons I keep going back. My wife also loves the chicken tender meal and, usually, the steaks (e.g. \"The Logan\"). I find the burgers to be pretty good, but the ribs to be somewhat sub-standard compared to other joints (and especially for the price).   Bottom line is that I go to Logan's now and then if I have a craving or can't think of another place nearby to eat, but it is definitely not my top choice. I can get a better burger somewhere else, better ribs somewhere else, better chicken somewhere else. Those darned yeast rolls, however, I have been unable to get my fix for at any other restaurants. Also, at least so far, service has generally been above average, especially when we've had problems. I abhor bad service, more so than hit-or-miss food, which is probably why I put up with this place.   If I could make one recommendation to management here, it would be to improve their consistency on the food a bit. I'd be happy to give more than 3 stars if I didn't have so many 'experiences' regarding my food. Will certainly update my review as time goes on and I get more experience with this place."}
{"text":"Logan's is fine, but it's not all that different from every other peanuts on the floor steakhouse in the Valley. I'm afraid it just doesn't excite me much lately.  The food is fine. The rolls are good but very unhealthy; you'll be served an ample supply. The steaks are decent but not fantastic; the vegetable skewers and shrimp skewers are a much better option. If you want a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, head up the road to Famous Daves. These are bland and too sweet.  One big disappointment with Logan's are the salads. I love a salad with steak on it, but the options here are limited. Chicken, yes. Steak, no.  The frozen margaritas (strawberry, raspberry or peach) are fantastic, and they're half-priced during happy hour. After one or two, the pulled pork tastes better (ok, not really, but I don't mind so much).  One big negative: the noise. It's hard to hear your own thoughts in this place, even if you sit in the restaurant away from the bar. I've asked for the music to be turned down a bit, but it's never happened."}
{"text":"Had the chicken fried steak & boy was I disappointed!  Ordered a salad too & don't know which was worse. The chicken fried steak seemed like it was a frozen patty & the ranch dressing & croutons were so bland. Wish we had gone to TX Roadhouse who has a flavorful ranch dressing & delicious croutons. Logans tables were sticky & dirty & environment just seemed musty & dirty!  Needs a lot of attention."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a chain with a chain feel. You know what you are going to get. I had the BBQ Pork Chops which were good enough and my GF had the Country Fried Steak. Her meal beat mine hands down. I cannot say I will be rushing back but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"If McDonald's got into the steakhouse business it would be Logan's. The Mac and Cheese is basically KRAFT, the mashed potatoes and gravy are instant/canned. The rice pilaf I was originally served with my meal was literally scraped out of the pan to make one final order. I just dropped $27 and you're serving me garbage. I understand this is not Ruth Chris but give me a break and have an ounce of respect for the people you're serving. My Porterhouse was low quality and as other reviewers have said very chewy, my mother ordered the salmon and she said it was ok although her broccoli was \"mushy\"   If someone gave me a gift certificate to this place i'd re gift it someone I hate. Never again under any circumstance. F*** this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the meat-sampler which included pulled pork, ribs and BBQ chicken with two sides for less than $20.  Of course, this included their warm and tasty bread with all-you-can-eat peanuts.  Our server was spot-on with every need we had.  I noticed that a lot of people don't care for the food quality, but I personally didn't have any issues of great importance to speak of."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time Saturday night because our friends got a Buy1 Get 1 coupon in the mail, so we figured, why the heck not. It was super crowded - i guess because this coupon was only valid Saturday night, so apparently more than just my friends thought to take advantage of the deal. Took us about 45 minutes for our name to be called.  The place was very casual - peanut shells all over the floor. Definitely not your first date type of place, ha. Even with the crowds, it took a rather long time for the server to even come acknowledge us, which bugged me from the get-go because I was extremely thirsty.  After that, it was all smooth sailing. Appetizers - fried onions - were good but super hot. I had the Teriyaki steak w/ mashed potatoes and caesar salad. Husband had the prime rib w/ the loaded baked potato. Both our meals were delicious.   When we got our checks, the waitress actually slipped us a Buy 1 Get 1 coupon as well, which I was really impressed with because normally servers hate coupons because most people forget to tip on what the original amount was. So the fact that she voluntarily gave us that coupon made me forget about the wait in the beginning, and we ended up leaving her a nice tip.  All in all, good...but don't see us going out of our way to go back there."}
{"text":"3 stars is generous.  So close yet so far  away. Menu is great and I was surprised to see lots of combos for surf and turf. The server was young but very attentive but not overly. I thought the prices were very reasonable for a steakhouse.   Contrary to what you might think, it's better to eat at a restaurant when it's busier rather than slow. Good cooks get \"in the zone\" and rock it out when it's busy. When its slow they space things off and in this case forget to flip my supposed to be mid-rare ribeye before it was too late and over cooked.   Jen's steak was overcooked but not as bad. They must have been cooking a lot of fish because the grilled vegetables had that added flavor of old seafood. Not a combo I would have visioned but hey maybe some people like that warm fish taste all over their zucchini.  Great pun!  I'm hilarious. I had a great follow up joke but Jen wouldn't let me post it.   My mom ate til she was burping full and liked it a lot but she's 79 and was dipping the celery from the app sampler into the marinara so in not sure if her stamp of approval counts.   It will probably be back but not for a while. The menu and staff made the visit pleasant but the kitchen did the opposite. I would rather have a horrible waiter and good food."}
{"text":"So we arrived at 1:40 pm, and drinks arrived 20 minutes after sitting down. Once our food arrived the ribeye at the table was extra well, yet ordered as med-well, and over salted to the point that it melted your tongue. The re-cook came back as RARE. The manager was misplaced in his \"de-escalation skills\" , mind you no one was upset more like greatly disappointed. As polite as we were, the manager in the end snatched the recite from my friend's hands, spun around and said as he left, \"I'll take care of it!\"... I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Logan's steakhouse..it was awesome! Food came out hot and cooked to perfection..our server Casey was amazing, never ran low on beverages or bread and our food was timed perfectly..me and my boyfriend will be back and will ask to see if Casey is available."}
{"text":"While driving by my wife and I decided to stop in and try them out.  We were seated in the booth right next to in fact looking into the kitchen; and that was after being moved once already because of the insanely loud birthday party.   Once adjusted to the new noise level our server told us she would be right back with our bread, 12 minutes later she said she just waiting on the bread to cook but did bring us our drinks.  The staff seemed very lethargic even the Manager had a personality of a bowl of cheerios. My chicken was ho hum and my wife's burger was very sloppy and actually fell apart in her hand and the meat had a very peculiar after taste.  Maybe we shouldn't go to a \"steak\" place for what we ordered but...  live and learn."}
{"text":"Logan's has excellent prime rib at the weekends. Good food, fair prices, fun atmosphere - somewhere to go for a casual dinner out after work."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and a lot of it! Service was friendly and attentive. Can't find anything bad to say! We will definitely be back! Heather was great!"}
{"text":"Ok this is my 3rd time here to eat and i have to say  yet again i wasn't happy with my food at all. They over cook my steak to the point i couldn't even cut in to it at all . Then they didn't cook my shrip the way i asked for it was cool and tasted like they didn't even wash it. But on the plus side they waitress did take my meal off the bill but didn't ask me if i wanted something els . So i will never come back here agin."}
{"text":"Took the family to the recent opening of this local Logan's Roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local 'gem'.  Initial impressions were that Logan's is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service.  Anyway back to Logan's, atmosphere was 'okay' (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that 'sealed the deal' - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasn't anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, there's just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think I'm being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, that's gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!) So by now you can obviously guess that I don't recommend Logan's.  I really only have one more thing to add.... .....Don't mess with Texas....."}
{"text":"I was in the area and was looking for a new place to try out for a late weekend lunch.  I heard about this place before, and saw it was close and decided to try it out after looking at the menu online.  I arrived just after 4:00 PM.  The potato skins were delicious and filling.  The blue cheese dressing served with my salad was also delicious.  It was hard eating the salad from a plate without a rim as most of the toppings slid off the plate and onto the table.  The rolls were large, fluffy, and buttery and I didn't see the need for extra butter.  The server kept on top of drink refills.  When I glanced at the time, it was passing 5:00 PM and the entrees had not yet arrived.  Shortly after looking at the time, a manager stopped at the table and apologized for the wait and said the food would be out shortly.  The chicken tenders were just OK.  For being advertised as southern fried, I was expecting some spice.  The mashed potatoes were made from old baked potatoes with the skins on.  The skins were tough and chewy, and it felt like I was eating around land mines in my mouth so I didn't finish them.  The honey mustard was flavorful but watery and didn't stick to the chicken well.  The BBQ sauce was average.  On the way out there were a ton of people waiting to be seated for dinner.  I can't believe how many people were there waiting!  This restaurant is so much like Texas Roadhouse.  I would rather go there where the food and service is better and where portions are larger."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment! My family always enjoy the peanuts & the biscuits. Their entrees are always good with sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"One word describes the food here...HORRIBLE!  Everything was salty! From the appetizers to the salad and soup. WAY too much salt, we couldn't even eat our sample platter because of the over seasoning. I seriously tasted salt in my mouth for 2 days after eating here and felt sick. I love salt. I practically drink soy sauce so you know it's REALLY bad when I say something is too salty.  I also had a salmon Caesar. Salmon was over cooked, lettuce soggy, and again salmon, salad SALTY! They need to keep their cooks away from the shaker!"}
{"text":"Food and service always great   Excellent value. ..especially 2 dinners for $14 99  M-W.  Full portions with 2 sides for each meal"}
{"text":"We are in the area for vacation.  Stopped by here Friday night. Our server was Makaila, what a wonderful job she did. She picked my meal! Excellent NY strip with fantastic asparagus and the loaded sweet potato was mmmmmm!  Shexwas,extremely pleasant and is the reason you need to come to Logan's. Makaila,was,so good we stopped back Monsay night before heading home in the morning. To Our Pleasant Suprise she WAS Working THE bar.We were greater with hugs. She remembered our drinks and remembered everything about us. EXCELLENT JOB !"}
{"text":"I guess there was a reason the restaurant was empty.  It wasn't good. Had the 2-piece; brisket and ribs.  The brisket was like eating shoe leather. I used almost a bottle of BBQ sauce to soak up first.  Ribs were ok. Better than brisket.  Menu is outdated and inaccurate.  Wanted the mint ice cream bucket on every menu and table tent.  Was told that special ended years ago!! So did the customers."}
{"text":"Logan's is and had always been my family's favorite place to eat. Managers and all their staff make our visit feel like home. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Logan's Roadhouse for handling the \"Mother's Day\" after church crowd! We had an amazing waitress who deserves some sort of medal! Her name was \"Taylor\" and she made the entire experience worth being there! Food was decent... yeast rolls, salad and sides were amazing... steak was a little chewy, but not unbearable. Our table of four enjoyed it and will make a return visit! (Will ask for Taylor--she was the best!)"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has that many stars! I trusted these reviews, as I am new to Arizona. This place is mediocre at best.  The food isn't good. At all.  The appetizers are like the ones you'd get out of the freezer section from the grocery store, except not as good.  The Caesar salad was horrible. Even the loaded baked potato was bland! How does that even happen?!  I will never go back, and I suggest you think twice before trying this place."}
{"text":"We just go there for lunch and its always very good.  I got a burger and a stella.  Both hit the spot.  Our bartender was spot on. Only complaint, please clean that crap up off the floor come on."}
{"text":"I had smelled all the great smokey flavors coming from the place right across the parking lot a, few times, so I figured I'd take my wife and son for a nice dinner.  My wife like the onion covered steak ok.  I ordered the sirloin with lobster.  The steak was ordered med rare, and it was like rubber, with hardly any flavor.  The \"lobster\" was WAAAAAY over cooked and was about the size of a crawdad tail. Lame spot, waitress was horribly unfriendly, and the girl that brought our food wouldnt shut up long enough for me to start eating hntil my food was cold, or maybe it was cold when it got there"}
{"text":"We have been eating at various Logans roadhouse restaurants accross the USA for a very long time now. With that said I Must Ask HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF PORTERHOUSE STEAKS!!! The manager should be fired for running out of steak in a steakhouse. We drove 45 mins to this Logans just to find out the signature steak is not in stock. We will never return to this location for that reason.   We did stay and got served horrible food. The lobster shrimp dip was soured that sickly sweet taste. It had the taste of old seafood set out too long. So we sent it back for the Nashville trio of fried pickles, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. the fried pickles were served as a big wad all stuck together and it was all dripping with oil. Salads came out next. They were fine, it's a salad.   Entrees were Prime Rib Shrimp special for the wife and I ordered an old favorite the chopped steak. My wife ordered her Prime Rib medium and it arrived extra well done. You could hear the sawing it took to break off a piece. Not a spot of red anywhere in that steak. It also looked manged as though it was the end tip no one wanted a week ago. Shrimp was ok but that's it. my Chopped steak ordered mid-career was also cooked super well done. not a speck of juice anywhere in that check of dust. Basically everything was cooked to the point of inedible.  So we ask for the manager.  The manager started a blame game of her people and blah blah blah that I should never of had to hear. if this is normal and you have such problems with your people not cooking food properly You either retrain them or get rid of them. What you do not do throw your hands in the air and bla.e everyone else. As manager you are responsible.  No one else.  The only thing that was good was my wifes Prickly Pear Margarita.  She loved it tons. Will be her new goto drink at another Logans in the future. So we ended up paying  for the margarita and left a big tip for the waitress who was wonderful. We have to remember it's not our servers fault that the kitchen can not cook your food properly."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered the Prime Rib with shrimp for my wife and I ordered the Porterhouse.  As expected the food was all outstanding. My steak was an excellent Rare and the side were good. My wife truly enjoyed her Prime Rib cook a very nice Medium and she also enjoyed the jumbo shrimp scampi.  Multiple baskets of delicious rolls. Our waitress was quick, friendly, and seemed to enjoy her job greatly.  The only complaint was about my wifes Prickly Pear Margarita.  She said it was extremely sweet and tasted very light on the  tequila."}
{"text":"Ok... It is what it is... One of those overly kitschy places where the patrons eat peanuts and throw shells on the floor. It's not fine dining - and its in Gastonia on Franklin Blvd., so the element you'll see there will make you rethink your harsh judgement of Jerry Springer guests. It's a 'people of Walmart' parade to be sure.  That said, the steak, though weighed down with fat (ribeye), once cut away is cooked well and has a very good flavor. The salad is good and beer cold. We've been twice because the food is decent. This past time, my only complaint would be that we were at a booth in the bar area on Sunday and I believe out server was a blonde named Jessica... She needs to not carry so much at once. I get it, she's trying to get stuff out but the bottom of our salad plates were sitting on top of someone else's and she brought my bf a glass of tea carried under her arm... a health inspector would have a field day; she was also a bit slow. In her defense (on that point) it was very busy.  We'll be back because it's tasty. If you go just know you're going for a low end but lively and upbeat atmosphere but decent grub. And based on what we saw, ANY attire will do ;)."}
{"text":"Stephanie, Stephanie, Stephanie!  Love this chick! Awesome and Fantastic waitress!  Logan's you finally have earned your 5th Star! Steak was perfection! As usual for the past 6 months. Just a great overall experience and we will be coming weekly, if not more."}
{"text":"Okay I was craving a steak and looked up on yelp for reviews on steakhouse that weren't to pricey. I found Loagans Roadhouse and read through all the reviews it was either 5 stars or 1 stars.  Most of the one stars were about service not the food so I decided to give it a shot. I was by myself so I figured that service wouldn't be a issue. I ordered the 20oz bone in ribeye and I have to say it's was one of the most tender flavorful ribeye I've ever had for a whopping $25 buck a steel of a deal. I sat at the bar and was greeted with a smile from a charming witty young lady named Mac (like the truck) lol great service great and chatting with her."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience with them. Servers are always friendly and attentive to your needs. Plus, they play country music which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Service was good however the food is not. Portions are small and bland. I had the chicken fried steak which was served with just a small splash of gravy and no seasonings."}
{"text":"It's hard to call this place a steak house. It's the classic peanuts on the floor kind of place. My wife & I have been here a few times and it seems to get worse every time we go.  The last visit, my steak (sirloin) was ok. The sweet potato might as well have been mashed. I asked our waiter about the beer selection on draft. When he mentioned Yengling, I told him I'd have that. He then proceeded to bring me a bottle and said they don't have that on draft.  My wife ordered the classic cheeseburger with no bun & no cheese ( just the lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle). She's on a diet. The burger arrived with nothing on it. They didn't add cheese, but forgot everything else. The waiter that brought the food almost seemed angry about the mix up. Our waiter, he wasn't much better. I joked with my wife that he must have been smoking the good stuff before his shift started. We've decided  not to go back again! Enough is enough."}
{"text":"Had a combo with steak, ribs and shrimp and they were 0 for 3. The sirloin was dry and had an off-taste like the meat was not fresh. Ribs were badly overcooked and dry mushy meat, and the skewered shrimp arrived at the table cold and tough. On the positive side, they had good fresh-baked rolls. However the steamed vegetables were also overcooked. I don't mind the peanut hulls all over the floor but I do mind the lousy food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible experience overall.  Just went for my birthday dinner and was so excited to have a steak.   server carried my beverages to the table under his arm rather than using a tray.   Lemons were slimy that were served for my water and iced tea.   Typically I'm pretty understanding when it comes to service but this was unacceptable   My med rare steak arrived black and blue.   The loaded baked potato I ordered came with just butter and sour cream.  The manager came back with my same steak that had been thrown back on the grill and served it to me again.   By this time I had already lost  my appetite.   She never came back to ensure it was good.  My server asked how it was at the end of the meal when the only thing I had eaten was my steamed broccoli and potato and so I was honest about it and he said oh well and cleared the plate.    I am very disappointed. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"First time at Logan's and I will definitely be back! Last night we went to our go-to steak house but it had a 45 min. wait.... so we called Logan's that had zero wait time. So glad we gave them a try - zero wait time and better food! Plus I love that Logan's doesn't make you feel claustrophobic - it has a fun, laid back atmosphere with plenty if wiggle room! Ordered  the bone in ribeye with mashed potatoes & mac-n-cheese, zucchini appetizer, and also had a \"Groupie\" margarita. Everything tasted amazing and the service was excellent! The zucchini app is addicting!! Steaks were cooked perfectly and was full of flavor! Our waiter came by to check how the steaks tasted and I blurted out \"it's f**king amazing\" ... oops! Must have been partly because of the margarita but ... I meant it :) I can't wait to eat my leftovers it was so dang good!  I wish they had cinnamon butter for their rolls but those rolls were very delicious - fresh and hot out the oven!"}
{"text":"I went to this location a few months ago with ladies from work. We had a blast! The food was wonderful and the service was expeditious. There were maybe 9 of us and we had a whole section to ourselves. Good thing because we were a little boisterous!  There are not many gluten free items on the menu. Everyone at our table ordered fried foods which were breaded and I cannot eat. There were also dinner rolls which everyone enjoyed. It would have been really nice if they offered gluten free rolls or bread but I find that at a lot of restaurants so wasn't terribly disappointed. I ordered the filet mignon with a salad and was not disappointed. It was really awesome and tender! I got the 9-oz and couldn't eat it all so the rest made for a yummy lunch the next day. I will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"I was told I was going to receive a call see if they could do anything to , resolve the issues that went on while I visited the restaurant. I never got a call back. Not only dose you company have horrendous service but you're also liars. I am disgusted with Logan's Roadhouse"}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday. Place was pretty dead for a Friday night. We were greeted and sat promptly.  After being sat it was about a good 10min before we saw our waitress. She came and took our drink order, about another 10min and she come.back with the drinks but forgot the bring the bead so.we asked agen about another good 10min gos bye before we get out bread.  She takes our order dosent came back not ones for the 30min wait till she brings our entry's. She forgot to put the cheese on the  broccoli and she alright out didint bring any of the things I asked for like lemons, extra butter, more water, more caramel sause ..... the list goes on.  The food was very good. My t-bone stake was very yumi explosive taste was a little over cooked though for medium barley any pink. My server would have known this is she ever bothered to stop bye our table and ask, I guess its asking to much for  some one to do there job. I was a server not that diffucult. We also ordered a side of lobster those were pretty great, would have been greater if I got the lemons asked for several times.   Sad you guys actually have really good food but due to the poor lack of service I definitely don't think we'll be returning customers."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here after taking in a movie.  My wife ordered a filet and lobster, my sister ordered shrimp, my brother in law ordered ribs and I ordered rib eye steak.  The lobster turned out to be a large prawn and my wife described it as mediocre.  My sister's shrimp were the typical, small breaded and deep fried fare.  My brother in laws full rack of baby backs appeared fairly typical and he had no complaints... and no real compliments either.  My rib eye appeared to be a sirloin... not a rib eye.  I should have sent it back but with four of us eating together the wait would have been inconvenient.  The steak was cooked to the correct temperature but it was fairly dry and tasteless; definitely not a rib eye and not a great sirloin.    The service was excellent.  The waiter was attentive, friendly and very polite.  I tipped at %20 because of the service -- not the food.  There are better steak houses.  I dropped over $90 for the four of us and we would have done better elsewhere.  I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"We love this steakhouse! Mac is an amazing bartender she always takes care of us and is on her game the food is always hot and delicious and makes sure my steak is made just the way I like it!! I only wish they would bring back the prime rib and we miss Kiya"}
{"text":"This is the wrong address do not go to this location is at 945 north Dobson it is still in the bass pro parking lot"}
{"text":"We came in for a late lunch...We ordered 20oz. Bone-In Ribeye, Loaded Bake Potato, and Ceasars Salad ....it all came together as a meal....Aparently potato comes bare with butter so there's an upcharge...I know it's petty but I like when my server tells me these things...I don't like suprises....anyway after meal was delivered the server delivered the check 5 minutes into the meal....then she kept checking the book to see if we had put a cc In....We felt very rushed and didn't enjoy our meal....finally when she checked the bill the third time we said we werent ready ......so she said she was going to smoke a cigarette since we weren't ready.....We thought that was so rude..We finally just paid the bill and left..we won't be back.....also for a marbelized 20 oz steak it was dry....again we won't be back to this Logans~!"}
{"text":"My experience here with a group of 5 people was not good. We arrived for lunch right before midday and the place wasn't very busy. We got super slow service - it took nearly 30 minutes to serve the meal - and aside from one person who ordered a burger, everyone else who had chicken ceaser salads and other similar dishes were all commenting how poor quality the food was.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Redemption  Aftet our last visit disaster, we returned with Comploments od Misty the Manager with compa for a bad meal from a then [6 week ago imploding kitchen].  Meeting the new Manager was a nice touch. I think we will be coming back to Logan's vs Texas CORP Roadhouse.  Odd part that was what brought us here the first time.  I think consistently professionals is better than experience Corp Steak Machine.  Thank you to all the staff  Sincerely  The Thomas Family"}
{"text":"We went there with an open mind to past reviews. They exceded the reviews hands down. We were seated with 15 minutes at 6;00 PM on a Saturday and our server John made the meal excellent with his prompt service. The food was great, salad fresh and my drink was never empty. We will be going back. Service makes the meal and John made our meal very pleasant. Thank you."}
{"text":"I have been to Logan's so many times I can't count! It is a fabulous place for steaks and hamburgers! Every time I go I'm usually too full for dessert, but once I tried the Southern Banana Cream pie , that was the end of me! I always saved room for it or took it to go! One time everyone at our table took one home!!! Now I go in and am told that you don't make it any more!! Upset is not a strong enough word for our disappointment!!!  Please bring it back!!!?????  I'll keep coming because the service, atmosphere and food is really great!  Now put the Banana Cream Pie back on the menu and it will be nirvana!"}
{"text":"We went in tonight and were seated immediately then finally after 20 minutes of not having a single waiter stop to even take our drink orders we got up and left and were thanked by 2 separate Waiters for coming in tonight it's crazy they noticed we were leaving but not that we were sitting at a table for 20 minutes all in all horrible experience will not be back ! There's a reason the parking lot is empty it's because of service like this"}
{"text":"Well I have been here three times. The first two times I thought it was good. My friend and I had the steak salad. I was happy with mine but my friend sent hers back because the steak was over cooked. The third time I went I brought another friend and the steak was so tough. I could hardly cut it with a knife. My friend had the steak sandwich. She could not bite through her steak and ended up eating it with a fork and knife. The waitress was so busy she never even stopped by again to see if all was okay. I called and spoke to the district manager who did what he could to take care of the issues. We will try it one more time."}
{"text":"Yep definitely not doing this again.  Out with friends, all ordered steak.  First of all waitress was clueless took a while just to get a drink order which by the way we did not get when she finally came back to take our dinner order.  When taking our dinner order she was asked where our drinks were at and told they are made and be right out, whhhhhatttttt!   Okay so finally get our drinks and never get checked on for refills.  Now we get our food, 3 of 4 steaks are correct. 1 ordered medium well came back seared on the outside and bloody in the middle, which was bleeding out onto the plate, it was immeadiately sent back.  New one comes and is so tuff it can't be cut with a knife, it gets sent back.  Third steak finally comes now everyone is pretty much done eating except for the one still waiting for staff to get it right, and tada they got it right.  Took 3 attempts and over an hour of our time.  I'd give it no stars but I was hungry and ate my steak or I would have left after second attempt."}
{"text":"The last time I snacked on their traditional peanuts in a galvanized bucket was when I lived east of the Mississippi, in the volunteer state.  The year was 1995.  I was the fat guy with the receding hairline who always found the table to be positioned a little too close to the booth seat.    No matter.  I'd gladly wedge myself in on a Friday or Saturday evening, in anticipation of my weekly hand-cut steak & potato jubilee.  When I finally came to the realization that gorging myself on succulent bar-be-que wasn't providing me with a lasting happiness, I tried the salads.  I started out with the Fried Chicken Salad, but quickly graduated to the Roadhouse Steak Salad.  If you're pretending to watch your weight, like I am... might I suggest this manly concoction of mixed greens, egg and tender juicy beef.  OK, so maybe you're not \"down\" with the garden harvest.  If you really want to try something mind-blowing, I dare you to open your mouth wide, and tell your server that Swoopy sent you, and you want the Santa Fe Tilapia, 'tout-suite'  {culture alert: 'tout suite' is a French term meaning 'at once'}.  Q. What is tilapia, you ask? A. Short answer: a non-tetrapod chordate... aquatic vertebrate... a fish.  I know, I know.  I usually don't order fish in a steakhouse, but you need to free your mind.  Throw away your preconceived notions.  This isn't \"Preconceived Notion Roadhouse\"... its \"Logan's Roadhouse\"!!!  And this dish is unique and very tasty.  ~Swoop"}
{"text":"I have been to Logan's in Tempe, so when my friend suggested it for her birthday, I was all in. We went to the restaurant in Mesa. I sensed that the waiter was stressed, but he did a good job of doing his job. We were seated by the kitchen where a bad odor permeated. In addition, disorder among the staff was evident. Second, it took about 45 minutes for us to be served even though the restaurant was empty. Last, I was looking forward to my Cobb salad with steak, which I ordered rare, as always, but it was cooked medium well. After the long wait, I was too tired to try to cut my teeth into the four little slivers of steak that topped off the over-priced salad. I could have sent it back, but the booth was far too uncomfortable for me to take a nap for who knows how long. Instead, I forced myself to eat the soggy, over-salted zucchini fries. I took the salad home. After all, they can't mess up lettuce."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! The cinnamon apple side is oh so delightful! Never had any issues! I have had the sweetest waitresses. Some things can be crazy on price but, so worth it when it gets in my BELLAY! Haha."}
{"text":"We decided to eat at Logan's for my birthday because there was a shorter wait then there was for Red Robin (Should have been my first clue). They first said for my birthday I would get a free dessert. There was a party of 11 we requested the bread shortly after we were seated, ordered our food. We waited and waited, and waited. It took 45 minutes for us to get bread then there wasn't enough silverware so they had to wrap some quick. It was another 25-30 minutes before we started to get our food. Not one of us received our food at the same time. The grilled pineapple chicken was served with cold pineapple certainly wasn't grilled at all ever, I received the wrong thing, two people ordered burgers medium rare and got very well done burgers, my meal wasn't even what I ordered. And did I mention our meals all came out at different times. Then for the birthday dessert I was excited to choose the cheesecake for dinner and they came out with a brownie? I dislike chocolate and told them that is not the dessert K would have chosen and that K wanted the cheesecake. They brought me a cheesecake. Tasted like Lemon I was expecting the Margherita cheesecake. I didn't complain b/c I assumed it was free. Well that wasn't the end of it.  We get our bill, lol so they charged me for the cheesecake and then after I got my receipt they had even charged more to my credit card then the original bill.  They felt so bad they gave us a card to get a free dessert at our next visit. WOW needless to say I won't be eating there again. One of my friends then proceeded to tell me they don't eat there anymore b/c the last time they went they had no steak or salmon... hmm steak house?? I think they should close the doors. If your thinking of eating here Run to red Robbins next door. It will be a little longer wait BUT you will eat sooner with better service and better food!!!"}
{"text":"If not for our wonderful friendly server I would give zero stars. Food was horrible.  My husband ordered roadhouse salad, costs something like $14 she brings it with no meat 40 minutes later. So we complain. They bring him 5 small pieces of meat.   I had the pulled pork stuffed sweet potato, burned potato, old leftover pork, not worth your time or money to go there. Pick another place."}
{"text":"Been here several times and all I can say is we're done. Slow/poor service... Mediocre food and crazy high prices. Just no reason to go here with so many other options in the local area."}
{"text":"Will never eat here again took 1hour for the food and there were only about 15people in this restaurant service was horrible me and my kids never had one refill horrible horrible horrible!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm not usually a big fan of chains but we were out at Riverview and starving.  This was about the only place we had never tried before so it was worth stopping in.  I half expected Zombie Patrick Swayze to come out as our server ... this place LOOKS like the ROADHOUSE.    Anyways, I'm not in love with having peanuts sitting at my table.  If you have a peanut allergy you should not come here.  Also, if you like knowing where your food has been before you eat it, I would suggest not eating the peanuts.  Something about leaving salty child-sized food on a \"family restaurant\" table that worries me.    Anyways, our server was pretty awesome.  I'm usually unimpressed by the ASU student-turned-servers in this part of town but this kid was on the ball.  I tried the pulled pork sliders for my meal and I was pleasantly surprised.  Not fatty, lots of flavor, good bbq sauce.  Really a good meal.    This was a good experience and would probably sway me to go here over my favorite Chili's that is right next door.  They also have these little metal buckets that have chocolate shot things for dessert.  Didn't have one but I am totally tempted to go back just to try it."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but beware you cannot use that $4 off $20 at this location or any in NC. I just found out the hard way."}
{"text":"We came for a early dinner. We were served fast, prices good, especially Happy Hour prices. I needed a drink after the week we just had. Food is good fresh & priced right. Atmosphere is in accordance with Arizona style. They have a great sports bar, music just plain fun. Peanuts, peanuts & more peanuts!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Our server, Alex was good. For the price we got a lot of food."}
{"text":"Mediocre food especially their steaks. I don't know what has happened to this place but it sure has gone downhill. Meat and sides taste just okay and overpriced considering the really mediocre food. I'm sad to say this is my last visit to this place. I will go to a real steakhouse next time.   I tried the country fried steak and it was pretty much no meat with just all breaded fat fried with gravy on top. The entire plate was just soaked with meat fat. I was really disappointed.  Two stars instead of one because of the bread and peanuts."}
{"text":"logan's is nothing really special. it's a chain restaurant and they are known for their made-from-scratch yeast rolls. personally i really don't care for the rolls but lots of folks like them.   do you want to know what is great about logan's? they have a special on monday, tuesday, wednesday, 2 dinners for $13.99 wo-hoo! we had dinner here last wednesday because we didn't feel like cooking but we didn't want fast food.   logan's is located in the santan urban village which is adjacent to the san tan village mall. there happens to be a marshalls, old Navy, razmataz, and few other chain restaurants in the same area. i ordered the chicken salad and mr h went with the salmon and baked potato. both were decent but not remarkable. overall it's a excellent deal for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had last night here. As soon as we walked in we where seated. The manager came up and introduced herself, our waitress stopped by seemed like every 5 but it was more like 10...this was good for us from what we just experienced. We have been to eat here several times and they are always this friendly so l don't want people to think it's like they where doing something out of the normal. It just meant everything from where we just came from and experienced from previous restaurant. Which Logan's was busy as heck as well. The food is always great and they added some new things...thank you.."}
{"text":"I love how informal this place is. Peanuts are not one of my favorite things, but i love eating them here just because i can throw the damn shell on the floor.. for some reason it brings such joy to me.   I have heard the argument Logan's was before Texas Road house and vice-versa... both are good in my book, but each have a little something different to offer so you gotta try each one out and see the differences for yourself. Service was really good, food all came out exactly how we ordered it and fairly quick.   Had the potato skins to start(you feel like your gaining weight just looking at them, but damn they are good)... someone had the tilapia, another had these like chicken sandwiches, another had the steak(yum) and i had the baby back ribs which were perfection! The meat fell right off the bone. You can choose from about 15 sides and you get two with your entree.. mac n cheese, potatoes, sweet potatoes, coleslaw, veggies etc.. we all really enjoyed everything. Can't tell ya about the dessert to full to get any. Also try one of the Hard iced teas... it was a  party in my mouth ..refreshing and tasty  p.s oh and bathrooms were very clean.. always a thumbs up for that!"}
{"text":"the shrimp was slimy it smelled so bad. we waited 45 mins to get a beer. I had to walk in the kitchen to get water for the kids. Everyone's food was cold  all they where doing was restocking for tomorrow. We sat so long we totally forgot why we came  my dads 60th birthday. Way to f... that up.   Only thing good came out of the bar. And no to your question there was a total of 5 other tables. So no they where not busy.  Totally rethink where we take the company party to this year after this shit show....."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It looked very similar to a place back in Ohio called Texas Roadhouse, which was a great place to get a burger or steak. So, my husband and I checked it out.  Upon entering, it's not that bad. There are peanuts all over the floor. Which is interesting, but it adds to the rustic feel of the place and I kind of enjoyed the look. The hostess was very nice and we were able to get a nice little both.  Our waiter, however, must have been new because he kept messing up our order when he'd read stuff back to us. And then at one point when he refilled our drinks said, \"Sorry, I'm just bored.\" Which seemed like a really weird thing to tell your customers.  The food itself wasn't bad. I had Roadies, which were just mini burgers and my husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Both were decent, but I think in general, we've had better. The fries, I thought, were pretty bland.  That was about all of our experience, since we were in a hurry that night. I wasn't all that impressed by the place and I'm not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot. The food was good, the prices were reasonable, and the rolls were amazing.  Flash forward to the present. We got sat in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress was polite and took our drink order. She came back with our drinks (forgot my lemon), and took our food order. That was the highlight of our meal. They used to serve these big soft yeast rolls with butter when you sat down. Ours came out and were the size of Girl Scout cookies and were hard.  We mentioned to the waitress about the size and she immediately said they vary in size but she'd try and bring us some better ones when she saw some (it was so quick, the complaint must come regularly).  She brought out bigger fresh rolls about 5 minutes later, but they weren't that soft.  She brought our meals a few minutes later, but never cleared off any of the dishes on the table so everything just piled up. We mentioned that she had forgotten my salad (which should have come before the meal) and that my wife's salmon was lemon-pepper salmon even though it never mentioned that on the menu. And the salmon looked horrible (looked like it has been stepped on and then cooked). She said she forgot the salad, and then said the salmon only came in lemon-pepper. My wife asked if she could have just regular grilled chicken for her salad instead which the waitress said she'd bring along with more water since my cup was empty.  We didn't see the waitress for another 20 minutes. My cup sat empty, my wife's salad stayed bare, my daughter's potato was undercooked, my steak had a huge piece of gristle on it (not fat, just a big hunk of gristle to give it the required weight).  The manager finally came over with my wife's chicken and asked her to explain what was wrong with the salmon. She went through that there was no mention of lemon-pepper on the salmon and also said in a very polite way that it looked horrible. He said thanks for explaining and that as an apology he \"changed the price to the price of the salad with chicken\" since that was a cheaper item anyway. Such a generous manager to reduce it to the price of WHAT SHE ACTUALLY ENDED UP GETTING!  We realized how pointless it was to explain his logic and just decided to leave. It took 5 minutes to find the waitress and ask for the check. We paid and left, with my empty glass still on the table.  Weak service, terrible management, and poor food. I used to highly recommend the place, but now I'd say avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Second time here- Watch for the \"Bait and Switch\" during Happy Hour... By that I mean they bring you a pint sized glass first during the \"2 for 1\" margarita special, but then the second glass is only about half that size. WTF??? I guess they think after the first one, you might not notice??? Shouldn't it really be labeled \"1 and a half for 1\" then? Either way, I think there should be some type of a disclaimer about this on their menu or something. Maybe its there, but if it is, I didn't see it.  The first time I went here, I noticed this wily tactic, but I just played it off as a fluke or maybe they were just out of the original size glass, but when the exact same thing happened the second time, I knew it wasn't a mistake. Other than that, the food is OK but nothing really worthy of more than 3 stars. The service was very attentive, but the sneaky Happy Hour tactics cost them the 3rd star. In addition, this location shares the same parking lot as several BETTER restaurant choices, so the parking can be really abysmal and there is usually a long wait during prime time."}
{"text":"I would say that our service was terrible but we never actually got any service so I can't even say that. We were seated and sat for 20 minutes and never even got anything to drink, every one else that was seated in our area (after us) didn't have that issue and we finally had enough of being ignored and left the restaurant. Logan's roadhouse is one of my favorite places to eat and this would have been my fifth different location eating at and I've never had anything close to this at any other locations."}
{"text":"We has been given gift cards to Logan's some Christmases ago but never managed to use them. We were in the area and decided to give Logan's a try.  Our server Nichole was awesome. She was friendly, charming, funny, and very attentive. She was also awesome in helping us navigate all the options of the menu.  The Boy ordered their new t-bone special made \"onion brewski\" style with loaded mashed potatoes and a veggie skewer and I had the 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and mushroom skewer. Nichole, as mentioned above, was awesome with our order, recommending gravy for my mashed potatoes and making sure The Boy liked the types of vegetables served on the skewer.  The food is your typical \"Roadhouse\" fare and with the peanuts and hot honey rolls, all of the food was great. If you are in the mood for a reasonably priced American style food, Logan's serves it up."}
{"text":"Save yourself some money do not go to this \"steakhouse\", they have no clue how to grill a steak. I ordered the Logan steak medium, it came out medium rare. Fine, I can deal with it, i didn't finish it because it just got to chewy. My wife ordered the 6 ounce Filet, medium. It came out rare. They took it back, re-fired, now, not only is it now medium rare but tastes like charcoal because it flared. One piece of Filet ruined.   Manager took it and said she would get a new filet, butterfly it and make it medium. She came back 30 seconds later and said it should be out in 5 minutes. Well that's a huge red flag since medium takes around 10 minutes. So it came back out, there was blood pooled on top. Wife cut into the edge and it was medium rare. I cut into the center and it was raw.   The people running the grill have no clue. I asked if they had thermometers and the manager said yes and I looked in her eyes and told her than they aren't fucking using them.   Never going back, EVER!!!  We are now at Chilies across the street to get my wife her favorite half rack of Dr. Pepper ribs."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here last Saturday (the night before Valentine's Day). This was our first time eating here, although we had been planning to try it for sometime. We were quoted a 45 minute wait, which turned out to be only about 35 minutes. We waited a few minutes for our server to take our drink order, and again for him to bring the drinks, and longer for the food to come out. All of which could be expected on such a busy night. We loved the rolls they give before the meal. Both baskets that were brought we so hot we had to wait for them to cool before eating them. Unfortunately my mesquite grilled chicken was not quite 'scorching hot', but was pretty tasty with the mushroom I had them add. The food runner only brought one side each for my fiancé and I, so when our server came to check on the meal, he had to go back to get our second sides. My fiancé's steak was cooked a perfect medium & the ribs were good too. We had the banana cream pie to go which was good. The actual cream pie part tasted like artificial banana flavoring, but we still liked it."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, I had to grab the bar/HH menu myself and then had to ask for a full menu since I was never offered one. 2 main concerns & a positive:  the bar is a mess. The bartender never cleaned the counter, proceeded to ignore the piece of broccoli & used napkin in front of me left behind from a former guest and still delivered my food without cleaning. That alone made me scared to eat the food. Simply Gross. I shouldn't have to ask for a clean counter to order/eat from. Second, I ordered a filet and broccoli. Everything tasted like it had marinated in salt for a day. If you have to do that with filet to tenderize it, you may either be buying from the wrong distributor or have an awful chef. In either case, they are ruining a good piece of meat. On the plus side, their top shelf margarita was pretty good."}
{"text":"Been here 20 years and this was the best deal with the best service ever. Kandy was the best server ever, she remembered us from way back. Sarah , before her who sat us was so full of energy and fun. Candy was fast and very pleasant, never had a dirty dish or empty glass. Funny thing is when they keep checking to see if our steak was right. $8,99 for steak, large potato or salad and vegetables skewer. What's the difference on how it was? It's $8.99 and delicious and very filling Worth the trip from North Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This has become our steak house to grab a good steak without getting fancy!  We have eaten here many times now (after striking OutBack from our list - see my review).  The Steaks at Logan (I always get Ribeye here) have each and every time been perfectly cooked and awesome quality.  The skewered veggies are my favorite so much so that I always order two extra. Recently they ahve been \"raw\" and had to be recooked which was disappointing. When the manager came around (which he always does when we are there) I mentioned it too him.  He made an excuse about them being only heated and not cooked but honestly, you have to COOK zucchini or its hard. We'll see how that goes next time. They did \"fix it\" for me but since we've been there 8-10 times in the past few months and most times they are perfectly cooked, I find it odd.  The atmosphere is a bit too sports bar-like for me but the food is good for an easy casual dinner."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for... decent food and very inexpensive. This isn't a top tier steakhouse, but excellent for the price. Our large party enjoyed excellent service."}
{"text":"This location has terrible service and questionable food.  My wife and I prefer the North Mesa location instead.  We have never been disappointed there."}
{"text":"This location has never let us down.  Drinks always full, awesome filets and I can't get enough cinnamon apples.  :)"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you have a peanut allergy.  Lol.  There are buckets of peanuts on every table as well as peanut shells all over the floor.  We came here on a Monday night and we received above average service.  They checked back on us several times and drinks were re-filled in a timely manner.  The food/apps were decent.  Hot, fresh, but not flavorful enough to knock your socks off or anything.  We had the fried onion app which was good, but just not as good as the bloomin' onion at Outback.  The steak was pretty good.  Although not sure if it was really medium rare.  Was a bit chewy.  Baked potato was great, loaded with all the fixings.  Mac and cheese was decent.  Nothing special, but good.  Overall this is a pretty average steakhouse, nothing that's going to blow you away, but a decent place to grab a bite.  A little over-priced though.  You can probably get a better deal at Applebees and it will taste the same.  But you can't throw peanuts on the floor at Applebee's.  I mean, you could, but I don't think they have peanuts there so you'd have to bring your own which would be kind of weird."}
{"text":"Fantastic if you're looking for the 2014 version of Sizzler. Crying babies, Wal Mart refugees, jumbo tables of loud families, over cooked steak, mailer coupons offering 25% off.   If you are on a tight budget or a family of 6+ this is the place for you. Looking for a romantic dinner or an above average steak meal this isn't the spot.   Rolls are tasty."}
{"text":"Went by Logan's today and restaurant is closed; sign even taken down :-("}
{"text":"My steak and baked potato were good for the price.  The service was okay. The bartender(Tiffany) was awesome."}
{"text":"They charged my card $3 more than the total I put it on the receipt! Hmmm"}
{"text":"We have been to this location multiple times. Every time we had no wait and got seated right away. I'm not sure why they seem to have a lack of customers. The service has always been top notch with very attentive and friendly wait staff. As for the food, it is consistently very tasty and cooked just as we ordered it. I actually prefer this place to others like it in Gilbert. I understand others have rated it with a lot less stars for various reasons however I can only rate it based on our personal experiences."}
{"text":"The bread rolls..... Yes. Yes. Yes.  Everything other than that was just alright. The food was pretty good, not my favorite food ever. The service was pretty good. We told our server we were in a rush, and our food took a while to come out. We all ordered salads and burgers, so I'm not sure what happened there.  Overall, a solid 3. Nothing bad happened, but it just wasn't anything special"}
{"text":"It was my daughter's 9th birthday and we had to remind the waitress over and over, only to receive what looked like a week old brownie. Never got our salads that we ordered. The waitress seemed like she trying to be rude and when we asked for another water, because it was cloudy, she responded,  \"The water here is gross. Won't be better from any other one.\" The food that we DID get was mediocre at best.. I won't be coming back. Avoid this place for sure."}
{"text":"Went into this location for dinner and was told that this location does not accept corporate coupons or coupons for retailmenot ($15.99 for 2 people). Sadly, the franchise owner thinks that honoring corporate coupons isn't their thing, so we won't be back. The food took 25 minutes to come out, it tasted good but wasn't a fan of paying full price."}
{"text":"Met my wife here for a quick lunch in the middle of the workday. The place was pretty dead, and as I walked in I asked the host if I could have this certain booth (I like to have my back to something solid, and not open to people) He stares at his seating chart for another 3 min without saying anything after telling him that and puts me in a booth - 2 booths away from the one I requested.. I was like \"really dude\"... It wasn't busy in the area so I just let it go.   I got seated and the waitress was so quick! I told her as I was ordering that I only had 45 min for lunch she was totally understandable and said she would make sure I got my order quick. I was shocked at how quick our food came out. I had a 12 OZ ribeye because seriously.. Who doesn't want a ribeye for lunch. She asked me to cut into it and it came out way too done for me. I asked for medium it came out well... I told her don't worry about it I didn't have time to remake it. I wasn't upset or anything a tad disappointed but I just needed to eat and go. The manager came with our ticket and happily removed the steak off my bill. I explained to him it was ok, I still devoured the steak, and he explained that it was their mistake and he was not going to make me pay for that. He was very helpful and kind. Overall, this is one of my favorite places to go since I first tried it in Georgia when I was 18, this is my first time having a problem and to know the manager quickly fixed it without me asking was amazing. This place will still be on my radar,"}
{"text":"Probably, rated as one of the worst lunches I had.  Food wasn't cooked to order and it was very tough.  Appetizer was nasty and tasted spoiled.  (They did take it off).  Even the dessert wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment..  I ended up in your restaurant with a referral from my mother in-law. After being seated we were slowly greeted by an underwhelmed lack luster waitress named carrie, only to find out half way through our meal. Carrie was pushy and obnoxious about taking our order and only after sorting out the terribly confusing two menus we decided on our meals. My mothers order came without the fries she ordered and I'm pretty sure our final checks were not correct. Not only do I believe the prices are above average I was charged for two separate drinks, I understand mix ups but I feel more as if this particular situation was intentional, unfortunate. Not only was service below par I had to ask for refills on my own drinks because the attention to our table was so overlooked. Adding insult to injury we were the only table in carries section aside from one man pulled up to the bar. The food was poor the service sucked, for lack of a better word and overall nothing worth coming back for. For a personal referral I'm  disappointed and frustrated in this experience, what a shame..."}
{"text":"I showed up here 30 minutes before closing on a Sunday night after football. The staff was still very friendly and attentive, from the hostess to the waitress to the busboy. I had jst traveled for 7 hours, and it really lifted my spirits. Unfortunately the chicken sandwich I ordered was super sub-par. It was a bear breast with some sauce put on the top that somehow managed to make it drier instead of more moist. Overall a decent experience except for the sandwich. It would have got a 4 otherwise."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place and never think to have food. On a whim, I thought Id try it for lunch. They have a budget friendly lunch that comes with two entrees, two sides for $14.99. I ordered the pork chop and my date ordered the BBQ chicken. I was weary of the quality since it was cheap but it was surprisingly delicious and well made. The server was prompt and delightful. I am looking forward to returning. FYI- the special is at lunch from Mon-wed."}
{"text":"First time here,  we were seated immediately. Not much of a crowd for a Tuesday afternoon. Our server was friendly and went over the menu with us. I ordered the Roadhouse Deluxe burger with fries and my partner ordered Fall off the bone baby back ribs. You also get a basket of freshly made bread rolls. We were also comped a free dessert because server forgot my partners salad. All in all, the food was great. The service was great, we would like to come back again and try some other things"}
{"text":"Came in about 6:30, I sat at the bar. I was greeted immediately by Marc. He was very nice and hospitable. I ordered the ribeye, it was cooked perfect and was so delicious. The macaroni was a little too mushy for my taste, but with such great service I didn't mind or even say anything.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place always looked so cheesy, especially whenever they were displaying their giant banners that advertised some deal they had going on.  Just a wee bit tacky in my opinion.  Inside is not really much different.  There are peanut shells on the floor and a nice little bucket of peanuts on the table for you people who cannot wait the extra two minutes for the yummy free bread to come out.  As far as the food goes, it's pretty standard, but solid.  Everything was prepared well and seemed fresh.  I ordered the meatloaf, not really sure why, but it was pretty good, but a little heavy on the onions.  Their mac and cheese was pretty basic but really cheesy and gooey which was perfect on the crazy rainy day we went there.  The service was pretty fantastic, and my drink never went empty.  Our server was a little frat boy for me, but he was friendly and made enough conversation to act like he cared, but not so much that I wanted to punch him in the face.   We'll probably go back at some point considering we find ourselves at Mesa Riverview and Tempe Marketplace rather often, but next time I am saving room for the mini bucket shot desserts.  You get to take the mini bucket home!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give a 1 star, but service was alright...  Don't know who came first, Texas Roadhouse or Logan's, but Logan's seem to be a blatant rip-off and a poor substitution for T.R.  First, the rolls came to the table with what seemed like a hair on the roll, right on top, buttered onto the roll.  The friend I went with freaked out; I looked carefully and saw it was synthetic, like a plastic or vinyl sliver.  I'm in the food business, stuff happens, I'd just brush it off, but friend was freaking out.  Sent it back, got new rolls and was informed it was the bristles from the butter brush.    Meats were all tough and definitely not for foodies.   Even after ordering mine medium-rare, closer to rare, the 16 oz ribeye I got was tough, dry, and flavorless.  Yes, it was overcooked and I didn't send it back, but I know meat and it wasn't good.  I can't remember the time I brought back an entire steak for my dogs.    I'd recommend going to Texas Roadhouse if you want that mid-entry level steak with the roadhouse atmosphere."}
