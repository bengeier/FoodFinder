{"text":"The place was not full and the waiter came by once to get our order and once to bring our drinks. he did not come back again after that. not once. Thats what I call terrible service. We definitely got a vibe of attitude from the waiter and bar staff.  The sound system bizarrely uses some old stacked speakers in the back. I am guessing because they have a vintage look. These speakers sound incredibly muddy and have almost no bass. Possibly one of the worst bar sound systems I have ever heard. Music selection was also all over the place showing a lack of understand of how to make a mix.  Board games were fun.  We left the nearly empty place to try something with a better vibe. A friend of mine forgot her iPhone on the table. We headed back about 10 minutes later and the iPhone was gone. I quick check on \"Find my iPhone\" and we saw that the phone had been turned off, meaning it was indeed stolen. Our table was not in the general area (in the back corner away from traffic) so the next person who most likely saw the phone was the waiter clearing our table.   Needless to say this is not a place I will ever go back to. Based on the lack of people in the bar, we can look forward to a new establishment in that location soon."}
{"text":"Really great vibes and it's connected to Golden Turtle (Pho). Drinks are regular price and it seems like a great bar to go to anytime"}
{"text":"I came by with my husband and a few friends after dinner, just looking for a place to chill.  The cool, textured, wooden wall and board games caught our attention from the street.    This place has only been open for about three weeks.  I haven't read or heard anything about it yet so yay, FTR (first to review)!  They have a stocked bar with some beers on tap.  Coffee, tea, and a selection of desserts were available and listed on the giant chalkboard wall.  We tried the pie of the day and the sampling plate of sweets.  They were served warm and hit the spot.  The savoury menu isn't quite ready yet but will be soon.  Word is they will be finger/snack foods.    It was a Sunday night, so pretty low key.   Given the music they were playing, and the unpretentious atmosphere, this would be an awesome hangout any day or night of the week.    Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot on the  ossington strip. Very friendly service where you feel like an automatic regular. Great layout and decor. Will return without a doubt. The music they play is a great mix of oldies in remixes. Love it."}
{"text":"This was the venue for the latest iteration and final of the 2014 year of Cheap Pours and Sticky Floors.  Evelyn had set up the far part of the bar for our cookie exchange and wow I was shocked to see how much was brought.    We were offered an organic beer which to be seemed like a lager.  I've almost forgotten what other beer besides pale ale tastes like (almost) since I've been doing the PA thing for well over a month straight.  It was a different drink, almost foreign but decent.  The venue though is cool.  While it's a bar they still have board games and a big screen as well as a projection and last night was the Ducks@Leafs.  While it's not large enough that you'd lose people it's not too small that we couldn't have a decent sized group there.    The place also serves Vietnamese food from next door that you can order to eat inside the Well.  That's kind of cool.  While I didn't eat (I should have) I had a good time with my fellow Yelpers in a place cozy enough to get a chance to talk and be friendly.    Nice place, intimate yet not overly cramped."}
{"text":"I came here for the cheap pours & sticky floors event organized by Evelyn. This is a great place to come and drink, chat, and maybe play few board games. And if you feel hungry you can order Vietnamese food from golden turtle and get it delivered directly to the well. I thought that was pretty awesome. Golden turtle has huge portions. Back to the well, they have great tasting organic beer and whiskey (not that you should drink alcohol for the taste). Ambience is upbeat. Nice remixed music playing in the background. Large TV and a projector which makes this place great for watching games. Great service. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Had a great time last night at the final 2014 edition of Yelp's \"Cheap Pours and Sticky Floors\". Props to Evelyn for choosing a really fun spot! We had a little festive cookie exchange and the place to ourselves! I enjoyed meeting new Yelpers and also seeing many familiar faces.  Loved the vibe of the bar, rustic and low key. They have tons of board games as well which you can play at your leisure while enjoying adult beverages. From what I gather, The Well doesn't do food but you can order from The Golden Turtle. The bartender was a very nice and helpful guy, offering some suggestions on the menu (first time pho for this girl!). Its pretty cool, you write down your order then someone hand delivers it from just next door. Cash only for this however they do not charge a delivery fee - how cool is that?  The beer was cold and the food was nice and hot, perfect for a rainy evening. Loved my veggie pho, very fresh and flavourful. Bae had spicy beef satay which he said was really good as well.  I need to start heading down to Ossington more often and come visit this little gem of a watering hole again ;)"}
{"text":"I'd have to give The Well 5. Friendly bartender, lots of tables, the fact that you can have Pho delivered right to the bar?! (Food is cash only FYI. There is an ATM inside). I would not hesitate to visit this establishment again with some friends.  I don't know if the board games are always there but they were pretty neat. I like that they had a projector t.v. on one wall to watch the game and some TVs behind the bar.  The candles were really nice and although the bar was narrow, there was space at the back to put a few tables together which accommodated our group nicely.  The drink prices were very reasonable and the bar had a good feel and vibe to it (I'm always sensitive to this LOL). Good energy and a good time."}
{"text":"This is a cool and laid back place to get a drink and just hangout with friends.  It's a little small but there is room at the back of the bar where tables and board games can be played.  The amazing thing is if you start to feel hungry, they will order from the place next door for you (cash only) and deliver it to you.  Nothing better than eating some pho at the bar while sipping on your drinks!   The bartenders are really friendly and the vibe here is casual.  If I lived closer I would definitely stop by more often."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I did a little event with The Well recently, but I've also been in as a run-of-the-mill patron. I fell in love with their simple business plan which is why I wanted to do a little diddy with them in the first place, and why I want to tell their swell story to you.   Reasons I love The Well: +You can order Golden Turtle pho right to your barstool  +Their drink specials for primo goodness, get as low as $5 per tasty glass  +They have never-ending board games in great condition  These three reasons topped with their super-sweet staff round out their five star experience. I will drink from this well time and time again."}
{"text":"I'm always in search of chill bars to add to my favorite haunts list. I'm a fan of tasty beers, good tunes and non-crowded places. I know if a place isn't crowded, then it's probably not going to stay in business for long. But I've walked by this bar in particular for over two years and never popped in. it was only last week on a Friday just before 11pm that a friend and myself decided to pop in for a nightcap or two.  The playlist was great, drink offerings were aplenty and they usually have a drink special on the sidewalk chalkboard. Our server was attentive yet not overbearing. More people trickled in but weren't the disruptive weekend sort. We stayed for two rounds of drinks and I would have happily continued to drink had I not had work at 9am the next day.   I'll add this place to my list if I ever need a drink by candlelight in this neighborhood."}
