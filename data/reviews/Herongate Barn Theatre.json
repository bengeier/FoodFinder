{"text":"I've been here twice and really enjoyed myself.  The shows were so much fun to watch and the actors were very good.  I gave it a 4 since the buffet in my opinion is a bit pricey for the amount and quality of food that you get.  Also the barn smells damp which got on my nerves.  Overall a great experience and I'd go back for the show but not the meal."}
{"text":"First time to the theatre barn to see the \"Cemetery Club\".  The Dinner buffet was amazing! Nothing like a real home cook meal buffet style with so many food choices whether you are a vegetarian or a meat lover.  But Do find room for desert! ... again, there are plenty to choose from.  Everything was delicious!  The actors put on an awesome performance.  I loved the whole experience so much and been raving about it to my friends for the last two weeks that they made reservations for this Saturday's showing.  Herongate, your secrets out, such an affordable package deal with dinner and show."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place for a delicious meal and great shows. Although the staff try to be as accommodating as possible, there needs to be some renovations to make the washrooms(and the hallway to the washrooms accessible for people in wheelchairs"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to the Herongate Barn Theatre. We went as a group of 4 adults and had a very enjoyable evening. The venue, though a little worn and dated, is very cozy. Seating is pretty tight so I recommend getting a table in the bull pen or right next to it because there is less foot traffic. There are also two more private rooms at the back near the washrooms. Their pianist, May, plays lovely music throughout dinner. Our host (I didn't catch his name) was a witty, lovable former school teacher. He also sings and plays guitar. Both of them are happy to take requests and announce guests who are celebrating anniversaries or birthdays.   The dinner is a buffet set-up but the main dishes (fish, pork, chicken, roast beef and potatoes) are served by two people only and that makes for a long wait time. Dinner goes from 6pm-8pm so there is probably just enough time to get in there for seconds. The salad, soup and tea/coffee areas are self-serve. Tonight the chicken was unedibly dry and the fish wasn't much better. The roast beef was good though and the salads were nice and fresh. The caramel cake, vanilla bean cake and cherry pie were good, but stay away from the chocolate cake.   I must warn everyone that the current show \"Prisoner of Second Avenue\" is REALLY boring. The acting is fantastic but the show doesn't have any plot at all; it is about a stressed-out couple who live in New York and go 'round the bend as it were. We kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did. We all just got stressed out watching husband and wife quarrel for two hours.  That being said, I really like live theatre and this is a homey, down home country venue that makes me feel good and is a pretty good deal, especially if you go during the week. If you sign up for their mailing list you can get discount coupons. Most of the seats (if not all) have good sightlines but they are pretty tiny. The seats are not numbered but are assigned when you make your reservation on a first-come first-served basis. Even at the back we could see and hear just fine. I would recommend visiting the Herongate, just for a different show; the one coming up in May entitled \"Who Maid Who\" sounds promising. Just FYI the median age of the attendees tonight appeared to be about 65."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place yet!!  Husband bought tickets for the dinner and show for my birthday as he knows I love food and live theatre.  Here are my impressions of the place....  Setting is really great, it's an old barn converted into a restaurant/theatre.  The decor was nice and I especially liked the old wooden beams and mood lighting.  My only complaint would be that they squished tables in and we were a bit uncomfortable at our table as we kept getting bumped by people coming down the aisle for the buffet line.  Food:  I would give the food a 5/10.  It was ok.  Typical English fair of overcooked everything.  My husband and I did not enjoy the long line (over 15mins) we had to wait in to get our food.  I figured it would be a standard buffet set-up where you serve yourself...not the case here; you have to wait in line for food.  Some things were gone by the time we got to the service area.  I also noted that one of the teenagers serving was putting her fingers inside the bowl before pouring the soup into it...not good.  Live Theatre Portion of the night was nothing short of spectacular!!  I have seen shows all over...New York, Australia, Europe, Canada and I have to say the quality of the acting, scrip and entire production rivaled shows I have paid upwards of 100 buck for!!  I would go again, skip the dinner and see the show."}
{"text":"My seat was RSVPd two weeks in advance. My group arrived and had the option of leaving our coats at the front to be hung. We opted not to. In the downstairs restaurant, we were greeted by the host, and seated by a young man named Justin. Justin didn't speak much, but he and the other younger staff members took our plates whenever they were dirty. You get up to get your water yourself, and also have the option of ordering soft drinks and alcohol. After pouring myself a glass of water, I went to the salad bar and basically picked a bit of whatever I saw. I was in new territory here... As in I saw a white onion and said \"lychee!\" and the customer in front of me corrected me that it was in fact, not lychee.  I returned to my seat and enjoyed my salad. I noticed a line was forming for the buffet. This is apparently an old style buffet when you leave your seat to wait in line to be served. I've never encountered a buffet like this...usually I go to self-serve buffets. Anyway, I waited about 10 minutes when there were about 10 people in front of me. I think their menu changes from time to time, but boyyyy their raviolli was SO GOOD. I went back for seconds...and thirds. Their chicken was also very juicy. Everything else was above average. I just wanted to note the standout is definitely the ravioli. Get ittt. You also have your pick at unlimited dessert, which is a slice of pie or cake.   The only con during my buffet experience is that I had to wait in line...too used to the grab n' go self-serve experience!   You know dinner is about to end when the man playing the guitar starts singing. That gives you about 10-15 mins to finish your dinner or grab more food to finish. Once he's done, he'll tell you to make your way upstairs.   Once upstairs, your group is assigned seats at random. Their staff member will tell you where you are. Once everyone was seated, the lights dimmed, and the play began. We watched Sylvia, which wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't enjoy it as much as my partner's parents did, but I can appreciate the story, acting, and overall effort the crew and cast put into the performance.   Overall, I got a very \"homey\" experience here, despite coming here for the first time. I think the performances may be of more interest to older audiences, but it doesn't hurt to give Herongate a try."}
