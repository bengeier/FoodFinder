{"text":"I have been to this location a lot in the last few years and each time I come I regret it. Service and food seems to get worse every time. First of all it seems to have gotten less appetizing all around. To begin with the service is horrible. Long waits and Wait staff seem disinterested in what you are ordering, and they seem to always smell of cigarettes. I hate to judge on people physical appearance but the waiters all seem to look like those you would see in those faces of meth ads. Dirty, missing teeth, stained uniforms. I'm sorry but I prefer people to be clean and clean looking if they are serving and handling my food. The food here also has gone down hill. Nothing seems to taste quite right compared to other ihops in the area. They really need to do an over haul on this location. You'd expect better in Ahwatukee. You're better off at Denny's down the road ."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times with the kids. It's an IHOP, but with exceptional service. Cleaner and quicker than other IHOPS we've been to in the valley."}
{"text":"Great service! It was packed when we came in, but our waitress didn't make us wait. She always had a smile when she stopped by our table. I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"What a delicious breakfast! Came here with my family, and had some omelets and the eggs, bacon, and hash browns. The waiters were super kind, and made sure everything was perfect! This was probably my best experience at an ihop, wonderful food, wonderful service and a very clean and well managed restaurant! We did come during the late night, so it wasn't packed but there's plenty of room inside for family dinners!"}
{"text":"I've never written a yelp review, but feel this restaurant deserves a shout out. Wonderful breakfast experience! The restaurant is super clean, spotless actually, and the service was fantastic.  The hostess greeted us promptly with a smile, and our waiter was great.  He was friendly, attentive, and took great care of us. We had several other staff members check in and make sure we had what we needed. Breakfast was delicious and so was the coffee. Best IHOP I have ever been to.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This IHOP deserves 5 stars the staff was super friendly and we're pretty fast, this location must if been remodeled it looked nice, my split decision breakfast I ordered was really good everything was really hot and delicious, I'm not sure what those other yelpers experienced but I had a great one. If I ever drive by Phoenix again I'll be stopping here again."}
{"text":"One star is being kind.  If I could go lower, I would.  Awful.  Ordered an egg white omelet with fruit.  My fruit bowl contained 2 cubes of melon, 1 cube of pineapple, and half an orange slice.  Seriously?  There were so many people on staff, but still had to hunt down someone for silverware and napkins.  When my husband went to pay, cashier took payment and didn't even realize we didn't give her enough (paying with gift card) and once we reminded her we owed more, she was rude about it.  Really? She then took our receipt and threw it in the garbage.  We wanted it back so we could leave a comment, so she reached into the garbage to give us it back.  Gross?!  This is just a handful of incidents from our visit.  As the Italians say, this IHOP gets la croce nera from us!"}
{"text":"Went this morning with my parents and teenage son.  My son got a cheese omelet and it was not very good.  When I walked in to meet my parents and my son not one person at the front acknowledged me.  I finally had to call my son to see where they were.  The waitress was very nice however.  Then when we were leaving the gentleman at the register asked if everything was ok, I said my son's omelet was not very good.  He could have cared less and said that's too bad, but went ahead and charged us for it.  I've seen other reviews that complain about the size of the plate that the pancakes come on being too small the syrup spills on to the table and I full heartily agree.  Come on IHOP I'm sure you can do better then that.  Won't be going back anytime soon.  Uhg."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Don't waste your time. 3 separate times at this location, waited over an hour for food. On all 3 visits we walked out, it's like our server brought our drinks and forgot us. We could see good sitting in the window for well over 20 mins. No one there actually knows what they are doing.  Go for coffee and drinks not food!!"}
{"text":"If you come here at night expect to hear a lot of crap from the host Alex. Apparently he can't put a cap on his mouth and flirts with the customers eventually getting to the point of being loud and annoying. Also if there are teenagers her and are being loud and annoying don't expect the staff to tell them to be quiet because they don't care."}
{"text":"I took 2 of my boys here for a daddy/son date. It was hideous. The mac and cheese looked old. My corned beef hash looked like it was right out of the can. The pancakes looked decent. The water tasted horribe. When I mentioned it they said it was because it was an old building. It is mass produced food you can make at home cheaper and better. I would suggest finding a better option."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. My father and I had Dustin and Irving as our servers and I couldn't tell which one was in training! The breakfast experience started with two coffees and two waters. I requested \"Coffee with creamers please\" I received a coffee with a bowl of whipped  cream. Like that makes sense. After about 6-7 minutes of looking over the menu, we ordered Swedish Crepes, and a HAM and cheese omelete. I received my Crepes without incident. However our servers, yet again, apparently \"misheard\" my father in saying a HAM and cheese omelete. And Instead just brought a plain ole' omelete without ham or cheese. After waiting another 10 minutes to get their attention, we told them of the mistake and proceeded to act in denial as if they didn't make the mistake. Now this isn't my first day speaking but apparently it must be their first day listening. I will not be back. Don't spend your tip all in one place!"}
{"text":"I always love an IHOP breakfast for the mix of sweet and savory options for an affordable price. I prefer IHOP to Denny's because it seems like it's less sticky, mostly.  But it's also a more expansive menu.  I usually get stuffed french toast or some flavored pancakes with the eggs, bacon and hash browns.  On this particular occasion I ordered the red velvet pancakes.  Our server returned to inform me they were out, and she was so apologetic.  When we settled on a compromise of the cinnamon roll pancakes, she offered milk to go with it for the inconvenience (for the record, the cinnamon roll pancakes were good, but they were no red velvet).  She was as sweet as the pancakes, and courteous from start to finish.    They almost always get \"over medium\" eggs right, and they have turkey bacon which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love the pancakes. Love the coffee. And they make my eggs EXACTLY how I order them.  95% of the wait staff are prompt & efficient. The other 5%, well, I actually haven't seen them the last few times I've been here (maybe they found more suitable employment).  Most if the menu items are very tasty and inexpensive but there are a few items I won't order.  Overall, this is my favorite \"fast food\" joint."}
{"text":"IHOP food, no issues there....the problem is service!! I called my order in 20 minutes before I got there and still had to wait another 15 minutes to get my food!  What made it so bad is I had to was I had to ask a couple times about the food!"}
{"text":"AYCE fish dinner was very good.  It came with fries, but it would have have been nice to have a small side of coleslaw or some hush puppies to go with this meal.  The fish itself was excellent (I think that it was haddock) and they kept bringing them until I put up the stop sign when I simply could not eat anymore. It was also a nice touch that this location had malt vinegar as I do not care much for tartar sauce on my fish.  The service was also very good and kept good pace during this whole meal as he was asking me if I wanted more fish when he brought me the original plate... Because he knew it would take 8 or 10 minutes to cook up fresh fish.  All total this was a very good meal and better than you would expect coming to an IHOP."}
{"text":"Aaron was our server on a very busy Saturday morning. We've been to the typical ihop, dennys, and any other breakfast diner and have usually left the same. Satisfied but not astonished. Today was quite different. From the time we got here until the moment we walked out we were welcomed and well taken care of  food was top notch and service was impeccable.  If you bet a chance to get Aaron L as a server....do so!"}
{"text":"Does you no good to do a remodel if you ignore your customers.  Had to walk out.  Waitress was too busy ignoring us to take our order.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, this was a complete disappointment. This was the resort that was chosen after a night out. After years of never being taken out for my birthday, this was supposed to be that \"go to\"  food after being taken out for my birthday. 90% disappointment. There appeared to be only two servers working plus one cook. Not enough staffed for a Friday night/Saturday early morning, by far. It took precisely 23 minutes for my group to get served even just water. Granted there were three other big groups that were in the establishment other than hours the moment we walked on (three other groups totalling six or more walked in those twenty minutes we waited for our drinks), so that is the only reason I am providing some leniency. There were countless orders waiting to be served to customers constantly (minimum five plates waiting to be brought out at a time). Everyone's food, once brought out, was cold when delivered. Compared to the last time, the food actually had all of the advertised ingredients. Nonetheless, all cold. My BLT was cold as if it had just come from the refrigerator. The only thing warm on my plate were the three pieces of sausage (only three, really?). This is twice in a row I was severely disappointed with the staff working, and with the level of food quality. For a 25th birthday late night early morning meal, I'd much rather go to another establishment. At least the food is warm and friendly adequate service is provided. This place needs better staffing and management. It shouldn't be that hard to know that Friday nights should be fully staffed and prepared."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday morning but there were LOTS of staff to accommodate. Our server Aaron was friendly and helpful. The food came out fast too."}
{"text":"Giving this location an one-star review is being modest, if i had the opportunity i would not even give them a star.   Moving forward.   At around 9pm 4/22/2015 me and six of my friends came in. We were seated quickly enough, but that was the only plus. Our waiter gave us our menus and took our drink orders and said that once we are done deciding on what to get, to close the menus so that she would know when we were ready to order. This was not our first time to an IHOP so we all knew what we wanted and closed the menus fairly quickly.   After around 40 minutes to a hour, we were growing restless that not even our order has been taken. I had to get up from my seat to notify the waiter that we were ready to place our order. When our waiter asked what we would like it went relatively smoothly till my friend ordered one peach crepe with the creme on the side and well done hash browns, and suddenly came a very disrespectful sigh of annoyance as the waiter wrote that down. Like it was such an inconvenience to her to place such a complex order.   After another hour of waiting for the food to come out, we were just about to get get up and leave but the waiter said that our food will come out in just a few minutes. Now, we were sure that the food has been sitting out for a good amount of time because it was cold to the touch. We could not even bear to finish our meals so we left quickly but soon after that a couple of us started have issues with our stomach, such as from eating food that has been sitting out for quite awhile.   We got out of the restaurant at 11:30pm with such disappointment that it would have been a better choice for us just to grab food from a McDonald's. We generally give out a decent amount for a tip ranging from 20-50 percent, each, for quality service, however, it must be earned. All seven of us did not tip a single cent. This has been the worst experience we have had at a restaurant. The customer service and food quality was not up to par but far from it. We will never be returning to this IHOP again!"}
{"text":"It was free pancake day and the staff was excellent. They handled the crowds very well and maintained professionalism.  I will definitely return"}
{"text":"So 4 month and yet again visited not on a busy night. Greeted nicely directed to seating. Drink orders and food taken immediately,  However that's it.. they forgot drink.. something about had to do something got tied up..some reason. Food took forever and when it did arrive not even look close to the picture.. says topped with ketchup, mustard, and pickles. No sir no its not. Also says made with 100 beef, hashbrown this is true and tomatoes, onions and cheese. .. hmm well has browns where inside ... before yes. Over cooked and greasy.. none of the other items. Half a slice of plastic American cheese made into two triangles..beef and some tomatoes of. Top. Now when delivered I asked for ketchup and hot sauce. Was told just a moment.. again no mam.. I sat there looking good and then the server said oh yeah you asked for ketchup. Yep what should have been on the omelet already.. really very very disappointed. Wow  I miss my IHOP in Avondale they were awesome. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant  so much. I owe my life to this restaurant and the one waitress Alex Weiss. I identify as a transgender and I was gonna do something very irrational like end my life. Although I decided to go into IHOP to cheer my self up. Then I met this nice lass she talked to me like a normal human being even though I'm a transgender she made me feel great about myself again. and now I'm a regular customer and I go into this restaurant all the time now. I love it the food is good and the employees are great and Alex Weiss is a great asset to the IHOP team..thank you!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. Love to order the fit mushroom omelette and steal a pancake or two from the hubby. The strawberry syrup is a favorite and I loveeee to eat my pancakes slowly while enjoying a nice cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I love a good ole IHOP breakfast! This location is upgraded and has a newer design which I like! I have gone a few times and haven't had to wait which is great because I normally go on a Sunday or Saturday for a late breakfast ! Try the iced coffee it's why I can't stop coming back! Also good prices! $18 for my bf and I to split a tasty breakfast"}
{"text":"It has been years since going to an IHOP.  I've always associated them with Denny's but my mind has changed after going here to meet family.  Our server, Nicole, was incredibly efficient.  That place was very busy but she mastered every detail of our group; even my sister who had very specialized instructions on what she wanted.  Everything was perfect.  Also, she frequently came by to check on us without interrupting the  conversation or being intrusive.  Our late breakfast was not bad.  The chicken crepes were great as were some omelets & pancakes that our group had.  I always like places where the manager roams through inquiring as to how guests are being treated.  This manager was ideal in that respect.  To paraphrase Arnie S, \"we'll be back\"."}
{"text":"I've only gone to this IHOP once. Want to know why? I will tell you. Because I've never had worse service in my entire 22 years of being on this earth.   I went at around 12am. Which is late, but no excuse for bad service! I have gone to Denny's later and had more cheery people around me.   Anyway, so my bro and I get this one young waiter. Can't remember his name which is a shame. So he takes our order and is super short with us. Fine. Our food comes an hour later (I timed it) with only 2 other people in the whole restaurant. Okay. Cool. So I get my order, and it's 3 types of wrong. The waiter gets mad...at me??? Okay. Awesome. So he brings me my English muffin I ordered to being with. Except...it's half. If an English muffin. Confused, I asked where the rest of it was. He confessed that he dropped the other half, then ASKED ME if I wanted another one. Like 'Well I guess I can make you another one.'  Seriously? Wow! Yeah I didn't order half of an English muffin nor am I paying for it! Then because of his mix up, he actually never comes back to our table. Not even to bring me my muffin or to refill are cups (which were not refilled during our stay).   I'm usually not harsh on waiters, they have a hard job. But half of an English muffin?? Please. First and hopefully only time I will never tip a person."}
{"text":"The food at IHOP is always good, but the large variety of menu options makes this a great place to go with large groups of people. It's a popular place, so expect a small wait on Saturday mornings. But the atmosphere, despite the large amounts of people during the busy times, is that of a friendly neighborhood. :)"}
{"text":"Wait wasn't but maybe 30 minutes for free pancakes tonight. Staff was nice, polite and very friendly. Loved the pancakes! The kids want to come back for more."}
{"text":"Average food, but expected. Service slow and inconsistent. Air temp in restaurant about 60 degrees do bring a light jacket."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak sandwich is good, the pot roast sandwich is good, the Colorado Omelette is great.  Can't speak about any of the other items.  I rotate between these and can't seem to try anything else since I like all of these so much."}
{"text":"I seem to always get unlucky here and end up with a server that disappears for long periods of time. The food isn't bad, but it's really kind of hard to screw up mostly serving breakfast items, so that's not really saying a lot. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait a long time if they're busy. It's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Poor service though not real busy. Lots of staff. Eggs were greasy. We asked for 2 waters with lemon. Got only one without lemon. Took over 15 minutes to get food. Waited 8 minutes to have order taken. Won't go back."}
{"text":"BEWARE. There is a crooked server working here who will steal your credit card information! I had a fraudulent charge for $275.00 at an online retail website placed on my checking account shortly after eating here on Sunday morning, 5/20/2018. I called the restaurant and talked with a manager who \"assured me that this didn't happen here.\" That shows you just how concerned they are about ripping off their customers. In fact, it may have been the manager I was speaking with who made the charge. It's too bad because the food and service here is normally very good, but if you can't trust them with your method of payment... well."}
{"text":"just had a latenight dinner at IHOP....first of all you must lower ALL expectations when going into IHOP around 11, 12, 1 at night and anytime into the wee hours of the night. First we get sat, waited a good 10min before our server showed up. I ordered CHICKEN STRIPS & FRIES. my gf got the 2x2x2. We waited another 20min or so to get our food. Of course what does she bring me, a chicken quesadilla. LOL oh yea that's right i forgot to clarify with my server that when i said chicken strips and fries, i really mean chicken strips and fries! Not a crappy quesadilla. She didnt come by our table for another 10min, and by then i didnt want to wait another 15-20min for my correct order to come out so i made due with the junk infront of me. Yea it was junk, scraps of chicken that looked like it was microwaved or something, with tomatoes and cheese. One of the 4-5 slices didnt even have the crappy chicken in it!?!?!! LOL so.....idk like i said, you must lower ALL of your expectations when you go to IHOP this late, especially if you're not ordering breakfast items. So i guess in a way this is my fault for not expecting even worse.......but don't get me wrong, IHOP is good for breakfast, and i'd normally give it 4-4.5 stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in early Friday morning. Our server was AJ, he was fantastic. He went above and beyond to make this a memorable experience. He was fast, friendly, and always had a smile on his face. We will be back!(:"}
{"text":"if I could give a negative star this restaurant would have negative 5 stars. I like IHOP I usually find the service good and the food comforting.  This restaurant was horrible!!!!!  we showed up at 9 o'clock tonight and ask for a table. We had to wait more than 20 minutes to finally get seated. Our name was on the list and we were  supposed  to be first to be seated, but another family walked in and the person who was up front was going to seat them first.  If I  didn't speak up they would have sat before we did. So we finally got seated and then had to sit  for over 20 minutes  to get water. After 20 minutes I was fed up and I walked to the manager and told him that we have nobody helping us.  he came and got our drinks. He  took our order, but our food never came. What really annoyed me was that there were other waiters working on the table next to ours and two tables away and a waitress one table away who completely ignored our table. 25 minutes later we still did not have our food and the people who came in after us were eating theirs. I still did not know who our waiter or waitress was. Nobody came in to identify themselves and greet us like they normally do at other IHOPs. finally after waiting over an hour and still not having our food I went to talk to the manager but he was doing the cash register and so we just left. I have never been treated so horribly by anybody this restaurant does not have their act together the manager was nice but he does not have a staff that is people oriented. Would I go back here? that's really funny not on your life. I do want to mention that the woman's room was disgusting it was dirty and smelly and the trash was overflowing onto the floor. The restaurant was the same way when we showed up. There were five or six tables that had not been clean with dirty dishes on them."}
{"text":"This location is friendly and fast.  The food is prepared well and the prices can't be beat.  I love that they will give me a large iced tea refill to bring with me since it is so hot out right now."}
{"text":"Below is the complaint I wrote to IHOPS Corporate headquarters: We came in on the above date for lunch. We walked in and there was a party of like 8 in front of us who were waiting for a table. The hostess comes to the front, does not even acknowledge us and tells the party their table is ready. Ok so she seats that party and we continue to wait. After 10 minutes we walked out she never came back to the front and never even acknowledged we were there. The location was pretty empty also so being busy is not an excuse. She was a young thin girl with brown or black long hair and I think she was wearing a black shirt. I guess IHOP lost my business I will go to Dennys from now on. She should be fired. This was the location on Ray Rd right off I-10 in Phoenix. So tell me why should I try IHOP again?"}
{"text":"Came here at 1am early Sunday morning and the place was decently busy. My boyfriend and I rarely go to sit down restaurants so this was a treat. Brittney was our server she seemed very tired/annoyed so right off the bat I knew the experience was not going to be that great. Seems like they remodeled the place it looks nice.   Got our food after about 45 mins and it was pretty good. Portions seemed smaller than I remember last time I was there. I had to flag down other waiters that would pass by our table to get things I needed. Brittney only came to our table once after we got our food. She never got our refills at one point I was Waiting 15 mins for her to pass by so I could get more water. Very annoying. I'll probably be back just hope I get a different waiter."}
{"text":"My friend decided to meet first to grab a table, turns out we were the only ones there waiting for a couple people from our party to arrive. In the beginning, everything was great and servers joked around. However, we did not get our orders in until 40 mins. MINIMUM ... other customers came in and got their food before we even got acknowledged for ordering. We were there at about 9pm and did not get our food until about 10:30 - 10:45pm. The server's mood all of a sudden changed from happy to annoyed once she arrived to get our orders in. I tip base on service, and this place clearly did not meet any of my expectations for customer service. Having previous and current experience in customer service, I would have felt regrettably empathetic towards my customers and understood the reason why I did not receive any tip (if I was as rude as our host)."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was nice. But for kids eat free at 4pm-10pm was not applied to our bill.  Disappointed but we paid it anyway and gave a good tip for our server."}
{"text":"Good food. We always sit in the bar area and it is usually available right away. It's pretty pack in the mornings. I try to go about 11am and still pretty packm . I checked in and got free drink for checking in."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my friends around 11pm. It was really busy and I could tell so was our server, yet I was very impressed with our server, Teresa. I've been working in restaurants for four years so I could definitely understand how busy she was and how stressful it could've been but she was always super nice and ALWAYS had a smile on her face. She provided friendly service in a situation that would have most servers stressed out. And my friend was being lame and kept asking to sit at a table near an outlet and even asked to move tables at one point just to be near one and Teresa was super nice about it. I will be back just because of her."}
{"text":"The fact that I stood in line to place a to go order and as I finally made it up to the counter both ppl at the register walked away. I then waited for another 10 min to at no avail have many of the e.ployees look at me, but no one seemed to care to see if I had been helped. Usually I would have walked out, but at this point I decided it was best to just pick up my phone and dial a to go order in the lobby. The phone was quickly answered and my order placed and I was out in 10 min. It's a shame I had to actually call to place .t to go order inside of the IHOP because I couldn't get any service."}
{"text":"Was there once as i waited to get my oil change. The place had one occupied table. Five mins in, i haven't been seated. i had to ask if i should just find a table myself, as they sat there chit-chattinng. When finally seated it took about five mins to have someone ask me about a drink and five to get it. Two other tables were occupied, drinks served, and order taken. By now I've been sitting there waiting for more than half an hour, and not one person came to see if my order had been taken. The manager was kind enough to have me NOT pay for my drink, as i stated that i had been there for such a long time without service! And the person who did bring my drink out was either hungover, or just miserable. I could have been even a lil pleased had she smiled, and cared.  Was not at all impressed .. On to the next location!"}
{"text":"I normally do take out this location . Staff is always very nice . Food is great . Better then a lot of other ihop locations ."}
{"text":"Service was slow; we were in a hurry and had to wait way to long even just to order a drink. The restaurant was nearly empty, and there seemed to be more than enough staff to handle all the tables. Pleeeease please be faster! Not everyone has time to wait around while you take your sweet time!  AND the computers were, of course, down so we had to wait even longer to pay. My God, why why WHYYYYYYYYY. -___-"}
{"text":"Everything was soggy and gross. No one ever came to check on us for refills or anything. The lemon in my tea still had the sticker on it. Bacon was burned literally to a crisp. I saw someone put a towel on the floor to clean a spill and then place towel on the counter. For two adults and two kids it definitely was not worth $52"}
{"text":"This location is one of the best. We live right across an ihop on 24th st and baseline and I rather drive to this location because of the great service and food is always good."}
{"text":"Did my order over the phone and it was a bit complicated i could tell it was a new person but he was trying to take it with help from his manager. When i arrived they were kind enough to acknowledge that they wanted to double check the order because of the misunderstanding over the phone. I appreciated that they wanted to do it correctly and made sure i took the correct order. Since they were able to to take responsibility for it and corrected it right away i would return here.  The food was delicious by the way and the restaurant itself was really packed and it looked clean from the outside and lobby area."}
{"text":"Not a good IHOP. Two friends and I came for breakfast. Coffee was mediocre, had to ask the server (Torence) a couple of times to get the right order. Don't get me wrong, he was nice and patient, but just a little inconvenient we had to ask him several times to fix our order. My friend got coffee, and asked twice for cream, other friend ordered red velvet pancakes and he was given buttermilk. While they did fix the issue, it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. My eggs (while I did order over easy) they were still way to runny and undercooked. I've been to this IHOP before, and never had issues. Not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"We loved our server Kathleen! She was so awesome and sweet! Thank you for an amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average."}
{"text":"We (3) come to this IHOP a lot. Usually the service and food are consistently great. Today however the experience was much less than expected. The coffee ran out and we waited 15 minutes for a pot!  I had to get another server to bring it to our table. My vegetable omelette was almost half its usual serving. We watched two other  tables of two who where seated after us get their coffee and food before us. I hope this was a one off experience for our neighborhood breakfast place. *crossing fingers*"}
{"text":"Overall, a standard IHOP experience. The food was a little slower than most, but the staff was a little friendlier than most."}
{"text":"My guy and I stood at the door waiting to be even acknowledged to be seated for about 7 minutes. No it was not busy, and no there was not a line. the MANAGER/SUP made eye contact with me and looked away not bothering to even direct a hostess or waitress over to seat us.  Once seated (eventually) the waiter came back to give us menus and take our drink orders and then take orders when he returned with our drinks.   At this point another party (of 5) were seated and helped by another wait person right behind us.   The people behind us had thier orders taken 10 minutes after us and were almost finished eating when we finally got our food, at this point its about 40 minutes after being seated and a half an hour after our food was ordered, and no, we weren't apologized to or checked on at all.   At some point another waitress (many of which seemed to be standing around) motioned to us and spoke to our waiter in spanish and he scoffed, literally out loud, like he didn't care that we were waiting.  After we finished eating he offered to refill my drink (that had been empty for about half an hour at that point) I told him it was a little late for that. He only stopped by to clear dishes and drop the bill. He never checked on us to see how our meal was or if everything was ok.  We eat out often enough, we are good tippers, but no, We meant to leave you no tip, not because were cheap, because were aren't. It was meant as a slap in the face, because although I get that you were working on New Years Eve, we would have actually tipped you MORE for good service and having to work a holiday. We get that but we deserve to be treated properly.   We won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"love to keep it simple  just pancakes and eggs  thats it  have never had anything else  even when i worked at this location when i was 16 good food the staff has got much better over the years"}
{"text":"Cody was our server. We both checked in and there was an offer for a free refillable beverage. He comped one of our drinks.   We decided on our entrees and had ordered. Cody walks over a few minutes after and apologizes to us for stuttering because he just worked a grave yard shift the night before so he is kind of out of it. We didn't mind.   There could have been a mix up with my order but I'm glad Cody made sure what my order was the second time before an error occurred prior to meal delivery.   The food was good and I enjoyed my meal as well as my bestfriend.   It wasn't busy for a Saturday evening. The hostess was kind."}
{"text":"So I decided to go IHOP or IHOB from Dinner. I came in and there was a person at the computer so I said and that I wanted a table for one, he said he was the Computer/Tech person., but someone would be with me in a few I said excuse me and I stood at the desk waiting to be seated. After about 5 to 10 minutes one of waiters look at me and said \"ARE YOU COMING IN?\" I said Are you going to seat me? Just as this happen the person/greeting said how can I help you. I said a table for 1 he said this way. I asked if he was going to seat me in that waiter section he said no, in Cindy's section and she was nice. I told him the waiter was rude and he told me that the waiter should not have spoken that way and that he was wrong I told him I was about to walk out the door and spend my money somewhere else. He said I'll talk to him but the waiter Never came over and apologize!!!!!!!First and last time coming here"}
{"text":"I was REALLY impressed! Gave into a late night craving for chocolate chip pancakes ordered the meal w/ eggs (over easy), turkey sausage and toast! I was SO impressed, I never expect to be \"impressed\" at IHOP but really was. The food was perfectly cooked and our awesome waiter (Ron) made sure I got my extra whipped cream on my pancakes! Everything was delicious and I don't even feel guilty about my late night meal!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to an Ihop for years....and this particular location came out shining. Got a seat right off the bat on a busy Saturday morning... great service by our server, Irving....and our omelette was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love going to IHOP. They always take care of me. When I was in college I would go to the one by ASU after a night on mill. They are open for 24hrs which is nice because it is a way to sober up after being out. I love getting their bacon temptation omelette with the chocolate chip pancakes and there are 4 syrups to choose from. The staff is friendly and the manager Jessica at this location is very friendly as well"}
{"text":"Prompt seating by hostess, two servers (?!) -Cass and Cassie, but haven't seen her yet.  Meals options look good, and they're CHEAP.  I figure it must be small portions so we will see.   Place is busy and the volume level is up there but that could be because there is no obvious music playing. Meals arrived promptly after ordering, portions were fair size too. Service was good but the idea of having two servers is unusual, especially when you only see the same one.  Overall it was a good experience.  Not a long wait. Plenty of yummy menu items to decide from. Efficient service."}
{"text":"The food was okay, the service was terrible.  Our waitress came over took our order then she went outside..for like 20 minutes. Meanwhile I could see our food sitting in the \"pick up window\" under the heat lamp..for like 10+ minutes. I was wondering why  the other waiter with one table wasn't just bringing it to us...it was like 3pm so the place was dead. Eventually I asked him to bring it to us, geeesh. Eventually our waitress came back then asked us how our food was then sat in the back corner and talked. Didn't come back for refills and didn't come to take our dirty plates even though she kept looking over at our table. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"What do you do Sunday morning when you do not want any eggs or serial for breakfast? Well, we go to IHOP! And so we did this Sunday. Its 8:30am, there are ton of free tables and we get seated right away. Ohh wait! Its our server's 1st day!! OMG Horror! But, hey, you know what - kid was great! He did all just right and did not screwed up once! Kudos to you David!  So, anyhow. Pancakes were good. Coffee was warm and OJ was fresh. There were no hairs in my plate nor weird stains on my spoon. What else can anyone expect from IHOP?   4 stars! If you wanna huge portion of pancakes go to IHOP, they got that!  \"I like\""}
{"text":"No cocinan bien en comparación con otros ihop. Pedi un omelet de egg white y prácticamente me sirvieron espinacas con tomates. No se parecía en nada al de la foto. Hable con la gerente, me dijo que lo iban a preparar de nuevo, espere 30minutos me fue y el nuevo omelet nunca llegó"}
{"text":"Ive probably been to about five or size IHOPs, but I will say that this is my favorite one.   Why I gave it four out of five stars was because the wait.  Being so popular and good, there's always a line outside the place to get in.  I guess that's a good thing, right?  Once I was seated, the waitress was over to our table within the first minute.  She took our drink order and in another minute she was back and we had ordered our food.  One of the things I love about IHOP is that you get pancakes with almost every meal.  How could you go wrong there?  I got a ham and cheese omelet and personally I like to hit the pancakes first.  My God.. they were incredible.  So fluffy, hot, fresh.. with butter and syrup, those were gone in no time.  I moved onto my omelet where I discovered it loaded with a ton of cheese.  That might be gross to some, but this is was just delicious.    Our waitress was always on top of making sure we had drinks filled and needing other things.  Such a great experience. Love this place."}
{"text":"It has been two years since we've been to this location.  We stopped coming because the service was horrendous, the food was mediocre, and overall the experience took way too long.  Why did we think anything had changed? It hasn't.  Today we were here for nearly two hours!  That's two hours of my life I'll never get back!  And it wasn't an enjoyable two hours!  We asked for Splenda multiple times.  Splenda never came.  We finally asked a manager who brought the Splenda.  Refills were slow which is a shame.  If you are going to make me wait forever for my food you could at least keep the tea glass filled.  When the food finally did come, three plates arrived and two of us had to wait another 10 minutes.  Once the food arrived our waitress immediately dropped the bill.  Really?  No problem.  We will gladly get out and not be back!  Can't believe two years have gone by and they still haven't figured this out!"}
{"text":"I've always LOVED IHOP and every now again My wife and I need our fix. Service was EXCELLENT on this particular occasion. Waiter was very efficient I ordered Country Fried Steak. Man....So goood!! Although very busy, I was impressed how fast we got our food. i am pretty understanding when it gets busy sometimes(as long as it isn't a crazy long time), and give businesses some slack considering i worked in restaurants myself.... so i get i. Thank you for a very pleasant experience IHOP!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The restaurant needs to be vacuumed like yesterday.... Our waitress was very nice and efficient. She was the best part about the visit every thing else was less than ordinary. It's so dirty and the ceiling has tiles hanging and missing. This place could really use an update and a deep cleaning. I was super skeptical about eating the food based on how the inside looks. Ihop is a well known food place and for it to be so run down makes the popular pancake House look bad"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Tucson and had to wait a very long time. Server was very nice and attentive. Food was okay (what you would expect from Ihop). Nothing special. -2 stars because we had to wait so long and kept being told we were next but really weren't AND it was beyond freezing in there."}
{"text":"I love IHop! Food is always fresh and made to order. Prices are also just right. My favorite is the quick 2 egg breakfast. Staff is very friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times to eat before, and have always had a great experience.  This IHOP is located off the I-10 and Ray Road.  For some reason, its listed as a Phoenix location when I consider it Awatukee.  I like this place because I have always had such wonderful service here.  The waitresses are always nice to me, I'm always seated quickly, and I dont have to wait forever to get my food.  Decent selection of food night or day, and the place is open 24 hours.  I know its considered a \"chain resturant\" but honestly, I don't hold it against them. Sometimes, I think we could all use some comfort food (like I needed today) and I think this is a reliable place to get it without sacraficing service or price."}
{"text":"I drive the extra miles to this location. Always great service, food delicious and place clean."}
{"text":"Checked in here again this afternoon. Service is so rude. Michelle was our waitress this time. Our eggs were runny. We made no big deal of it, just kindly asked for them to be remade. After all we are paying for them.. She pretended to be helpful, & like our requests were no problem but with the kitchen being open and us being seated right near it, we heard the negativity and rude comments spewed. Smh. Unnecessary. Besides the runny eggs.. Still decent food. Service has officially lost me though."}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfast experiences that I have had.  Ordered 2 eggs sunny side up, hashbrowns and sausage. Complex order, I know, but none the less after 45 minutes our food still had not arrived.  Obviously our order had not been placed, my wife inquired as to the status of our order and informed the wait staff that we needed to leave soon please bring out the order. What occurred was a train of people with various excuses as to why 2 eggs have taken now an hour to be cooked and served. We ended up having to take our order to go, what we received was two eggs that could only be described as extra well done and hard, burnt sausage and cold potatoes. Waffle House would have been a better choice than this IHOP."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location lately. The staff is in such a rush to get you in and out that having breakfast with family isn't as enjoyable here as it used to be. Twice, on two different visits, our food was undercooked and both times the bill was left before we were anywhere close to finishing. IHOP is always consistent in the food and environment but lately this location shows it's more interested in processing customers than letting people enjoy dining together. I will start looking at the other breakfast spots in the area even if they cost more."}
{"text":"I knew the second we got to our booth, everything was going to go downhill. The booth wasn't even clean. There was spilled water on our table, and the waitress wiped the water off with her hand. That's not sanitary at all -- why didn't they just properly clean our table? Then, she sat down to take our order as if standing to serve us was such a hassle. She started complaining about her knees, as if I cared at all. You work food service, and I know it sucks, but take our order and leave please? The food came out -- my friend and I were sharing the food -- and she brought out a n extra plate. The first plate, she saw was dirty so she took it back and brought out another. Then she saw that it was also dirty so she took it back. Why are we being given dirty plates at all?! We thought that if so many plates are dirty, eating the (mediocre-looking) food might be risky, so we didn't eat, got a box and paid -- and then threw it out. No tip because our waitress wasn't attentive in the slightest. We went to chick fil a down the street. And a woman there shared her experiences with me, about how they'd give her raw bacon and it would take them a long time to get it right. Don't go here. Really, save your money and take your family somewhere that's cleaner with better service. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, but the omelets and pancakes are better at Crackers."}
{"text":"Wow! This place looks amazing after the remodel, and they're doing a great job of keeping it clean. The breakfast was delicious and the service was friendly. I would recommend a visit to this IHOP any day."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience at an ihop I have ever had. Scratch that, at anywhere. The bacon was burnt, our order was completely wrong and it took a long time to get something as simple as toast."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but never sat in the far northeast corner. Definitely a tight space for large parties. If you have squirmy kids or need multiple tables, request to sit somewhere else. It was difficult for the servers to get to other tables. At the same time our server William was AMAZING! request to sit in his area. Great with kids, hospitable, responsive and great smile!"}
{"text":"This IHOP was recently renovated, so it looks really nice inside.  It's craaaazy busy here, but they try to make the wait as short as possible.  Service was fast, they got my order correct, and my omelette was delicious.  On top of that, they were having issues splitting our bill at the end of the meal so we got free brunch.  Thank you IHOP!"}
{"text":"Bad service from when we arrived the hostess was sloppy and he seated us  and was not friendly, the server William literally had not even come to our table to acknowledge us to even say I will be right with us , he kept passing us over finally after almost 10 min my husband said something then he bought us our drinks and took then left and another 5 min before coming back for our order then he took our order didn't write any of it down after 14 min of waiting for our food it comes out cold and on top of that the pancakes came out sloppy and messy the fruit topping was Everywhere and not on the pancakes and then after all of that there was hair on top of the butter on the toast. The service and the food was horrible today. We have been here once before the service was excellent and food good as well but today the staff that was on was awful not customer service oriented and not at all happy to be at work."}
{"text":"This IHOP has a lot of opportunity to make up. They've been working at it, but the last few times I've been here, they have either been short staffed or too busy that we would be sitting at the table idly waiting for our food or the check or a straw."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for breakfast after dropping off my vehicle for maintenance services. Service is very friendly and welcoming. The floor manager also walked around to ask if we needed anything else.   I ordered a smoke sausage with eggs and pancakes. Overall, it was delicious. Unfortunately, my friend didn't care for what he had.   I'll definitely come back here again for lunch."}
