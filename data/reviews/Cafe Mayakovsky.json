{"text":"I went on a Saturday around 4pm. Apart from me there was just a family of 3, but given the time and the fact that the intersection Tropicana/Spencer is maybe not the most popular, I guess it's not too unusual. I received a very warm welcome by the Russian waitress. The place itself is quite large with a stage  area as well as a bar section. It's a bit darkish and quite cozy, but your mileage may vary.  Because I wasn't really hungry but I wanted to check out the restaurant anyway, I just had the JULIEN (mushrooms in cream sauce and cheese), the SOLYANKA (typical Russian soup with good chunks of sausage) as well as the NAPOLEON cake.   I found all things to be very tasty.  I liked their homemade KVAS as well. A little bit of a warning, even though KVAS is supposed to have like 1% alcohol, after a few refills I did feel something. This is no criticism, just to warn those who are not supposed to drink any alcohol at all.  I'll be back soon to try their main courses."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. I had delicious mushroom crepes and they reminded me my mom's cuisine. It was an amazing experience! Highly recommended restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  The appearance from the outside is very  unassuming.  Inside, very clean and neat.  The food was fantastic!  I enjoyed the vareniki, the golubtsi and for my entrée I had the pork shashliki.  All wonderfully prepared and well presented. Delicious!  Just the change I needed from the every day assortment of restaurants.    I lived in Ukraine for a few years and this place has the most authentic food I've experienced in the states.  Service was excellent and timely, but not over bearing.  Vitali is an excellent host.  I will certainly be back anytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the best Russian food restaurant I have been to in US. High quality fresh ingredients. Cooked as my mom used to do it. They have all popular entrées. Recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Service was horrible took half hour to get my soup. The people who came in a half hour after we came in got their soup before me. The 2 people that I was eating with got their Beef stroganoff  and ate before I even got my Ceasars sald.  Chicken on the Ceasars salad taste horrible. I have been a server for 22 years  and have never had such bad service."}
{"text":"Russian comfort food! I'm of polish decent and this food is just like my great aunt makes for Christmas (if not better)  We tried a lot of things on the menu and everything was great!  My favorites were the cabbage rolls and the (polish) pirogies. I forget the names of both.   The outside area is a little sketch but don't get turned off by that! It's a must for anyone of Eastern Europe decent!!!   I'll be going back here many many times!"}
{"text":"Great food. Beef stroganoff is a must. Beer big and  cheep. Love the dark atmosphere and the Russian music. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Fantastic Russian restaurant, would definitely recommend it. The stroganoff was very good and staff was very nice and friendly, I will have to come back soon"}
{"text":"The Vareniki (Potato) were delicious! The Chicken Kiev was NOT good. It looked premade/frozen and was very tough and dry."}
{"text":"BF and I went to Cafe Mayakovsky on a Tuesday nite, thinking it probably wouldn't be too busy.  Little did we know it was Russian New Year and the place was completely reserved for the celebration.  After sweet talking the hostess, we were allowed to sit at a small table in the bar if we promised to leave in time for an 8:30 reservation. We agreed.  We wanted to try the restaurant to bring our ethnic dining club to.    We started with appetizers from Yelp suggestions of Herring and stuffed cabbage rolls.  Herring was fresh herring served with boiled potatoes and hard boiled eggs.  I thought the herring was too fishy, by the BF liked it.  The cabbage rolls were somewhat bland and with no taste of cabbage at all.  I ordered the lamb shashlik, and BF ordered the grilled cornish hen.  The lamb, my favorite red meat, was overcooked and tough with bits of inedible gristle, and came with some white rice with 3 cuke slices and 3 tomato slices.  Cornish hen was split and splayed on the plate and served with only 3 cuke slices.  No starch or vegs.  Hen, however, was delicious.    The restaurant was subtly decorated but attractive, with a large black and white picture of St. Petersburg on the wall.  There was also a small stage and what was perceived to be a small dance floor, altho no entertainment was offered that evening.  We did have a Russian red wine which I absolutely loved.  I wrote down the name to see if I could find it at Total Wine, but no luck finding it anywhere in NV.  Our dinner, including 2 glasses of wine each, cost over $100.  End result is that while Russians/Ukranians love this restaurant and are used to the style of cooking, unfortunately, we did not think that our club of ethnic diners would enjoy it enough.  We probably will not return."}
{"text":"Greek salad is great! Food is fresh & delicious. Rib eye was excellent. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Its to go spot for russian food. My kid loved the stuffed buns. The foid was fresh and cooked to order. I was surprised that the place rv was empty.l n we will be back again. Oh and the desert was to die for."}
{"text":"A definite favorite. We've gone before and will go again. Not your ordinary fare but but consistently great. i like to start out with the red caviar with blinis and a bottle of Russian Standard Vodka ( both a small price), their borsch is the best. All their entrees are great. Atmosphere is so-so but the staff and owner are congenial, making the shortcomings worth the while. We'll be back..."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended this place to us for some amazing Russian cuisine. We were not disappointed.   Its a small place with about 10 tables and a small stage where they have love music once a week.   Our server was very attentive and made some excellent recommendations, as well as giving us a little background on what it took to prepare our meal.   We would recommend Blinchiki, I have a mushroom allergy, so I ate the steak while my friends had the mushroom, they both tasted amazing.   The Pelmeni was by far my personal favorite, along with the Vareniki and Beef Stroganoff.   For dessert we were recommended the Napoleon.   I would also HEAVILY recommend the Mors/mopc, it was a suburb  treat on a hot Vegas day!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here. We absolutely loved everything that we tried. Beef stroganoff was amazing. Borsch soup was very good. So was the olivier salad. Would recommend to anyone that will listen..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Russian environment!!! I really enjoy the food good place to do birthday party!"}
{"text":"Meh not really that great. If you have never had Russian food before you won't know the difference. I was expecting a taste of home. But almost everything we ordered is just so bland like an extremely low sodium diet. But at least the Mors was good. And the pickled plate was good too. It's definitely not worth what you pay for it. It's a bit on the expensive side to the portion you get. But the atmosphere is pleasant and clean. The waitress speaks both English and Russian, so you can order in either language."}
{"text":"Excellent service and ambiance.  The cold herring appetizer is simply marvelous, clean and great flavors accompanied with boiled egg and potatoes along with raw onion.  Beef stroganoff was very good along with real mashed potatoes.  The grille rack of lamb was superb again I went with the mashed potatoes.  Their injured vodka is excellent and to finish it off Turkish coffee and honey cake.  A great dinner and enjoyable time.  Will be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this restaurant.  I had the cheese vereniki which were awful and I had the beef stroganoff which was just ok.  Not sure why it is rated so high"}
{"text":"Great Russian restaurant in Vegas, near the Strip! Very good authentic food, great entertainment on weekends, friendly staff and owner, very reasonably priced. Celebrated a birthday there, enjoyed it! Definitely will be back!   Spasibo! Otlichniy restoran!"}
{"text":"Food was good and authentic, but atmosphere during day was dark, dead and no spunk. It is setup to be a night spot with live music. Will go back at night next time. Waitress was really nice and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner tonight.  The place is very quiet. Only one other table when we arrived.  The food is very good. The price is moderate.  Service is okay, because there is only one waitress.  Overall is good, we will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The food is delicious and authentic and the owners are great. Credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"Excellent food..fun atmosphere and great service...awesome menu with a lot of traditional Slavic choices"}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner and dessert here. It was very delicious and we ended our evening with some amazing Turkish coffee. I highly recommend the shashlik and the napoleon. It was the best I have ever had.  My spouse says the Praga cake was delicious as well.  Definitely a place to visit even if you aren't familiar with Russian cuisine. The staff can help you make choices."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, courteous service, best place in town. Everyone will find something they like!! I forgot I was in Vegas ;b"}
{"text":"Authentic Russian is not something you would think exsists in Vegas at this caliber. It not only does, but it is plentiful. This is about as authentic as you can get and the atmosphere and live music are excellent. Gotta love the atmosphere here. Not one downside."}
{"text":"Food was good, Service was great with a touch of friendliness, our server was nice. It would had been a 5 star if wasn't for that unpleasant smell when we first walked in."}
{"text":"The folks at this small but very cozy place work very hard and well - and it shows. Incidentally, Mayakovsky has become our must-go place every time we are visiting Vegas. Seldom that I get such chance to TRULY relax and have a good time, great conversation over our favorite Eastern European / Russian delicacies. Yes, the menu is not vast, as it is a small place, but all the great and diverse 'staples' are represented and tailored to suit most tastes. This is ridiculous to read that 'food wasn't fresh and did not taste good'. I have been here numerous times, and I can reassure everyone to just nevermind such reviews... This is not a 'trendy place' or a 'Russian club' - this is a place where people have meals, and do so in a quieter setting so they can communicate - yes, good 'ole talk to each other, and have good time. Speaking of which.. the place wasn't loud, which is a GREAT plus to us. But, it did have nice ambient music that was set just at the right level by - yes, actually, a live DJ. I am pretty sure it can get louder and even turn into a small dance floor if there is a nice crowd and a good occasion such as Birthday... in fact, last night there was a Birthday party with ~20 people in attendance, and it still wasn't loud and the two of us were having good tete-a-tete time and were not bothered. All in all.... the menu items were great, and we have tasted quite a few - almost the entire menu by now. Yesterday I've had the Georgian khinkali, and initially I wasn't sure and went on a limb... and oh boy was I happy!... The dessert menu has just three items, but there is no wrong pick: the Napoleon, the Prague, and the Russian layered honey cake. All done expertly and presented in a very nice way. In conclusion, I do recommend this place wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"If you like the Russian food do not miss this address. We are not disappointed. Located at the southern Vegas close to the pinball museum. Recommended."}
{"text":"My first authentic Russian food & it will not be my last - especially at this place. The stroganoff & borscht were amazing. Great comfort food. Our server was helpful & courteous in answering our many questions. Try this place - really. It was like a mini-vacation to Moscow."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef pirozhki, cream of mushroom soup, schnitzel and chicken patties. Everything was very tasty. The decor is a little dingy and service a bit slow. However, I will definitely be coming back to try more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"Vegas can get loud, hectic and overly expensive. So the trip to Cafe Mayakovsky was even more of a treat than if it were in any other city. It was refuge from the craziness; quiet, relaxing, civil and the best part, it had really, really great food. My Chicken Kiev was to die for, the dumplings were so good we were fighting over the last one, and my husbands goulash was mouthwatering. The prices were fine, and compared to what we spent on tasteless food on the Strip, I was happy to hand over our hard-worked AmEx for such a delightful experience. Thanks, Cafe Mayakovsky."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Monday to celebrate our birthdays and were one of three tables seated. It was pretty slow inside and we had no issues with service. Started out with some appetizers which were quite filling and delicious. Main dishes (I chose the schnitzle and she ordered the chicken Kiev) were quite tasty and we ended up getting to go boxes to take half of them home. If you do order the Kiev be prepared for a wait. I think it took us close to 30 minutes to get our main dishes because of that. No worries as it gave us time to enjoy our appetizers and glasses of wine. We got to try some wine that was specific to the Georgian (Russia, not the US lol) region. Very good, albeit a bit on the sweet side. Would not hesitate to come back for another visit!"}
{"text":"The best Russian food in Vegas. Service is excellent and very friendly. Everything we tried off the menu is very good, just like homemade. Make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. This was our first time eating Russian food. The waiter took the time to explain everything on the menu and answer all of our questions. His suggestions were perfect and it enhanced the experience. The food is very reasonably priced.  The food was all fresh and very well seasoned.  The two of us dining ordered enough food for four people so we could try many different dishes. There was very little food left for us to take home because we couldn't stop eating. This is definitely going to be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"FABULOUS FOOD! OMG! This food tastes like home cooking and it's really good. We ordered one dish at first, but that ended up being 5 dishes! AND 3  desserts between the 4 of us!:)"}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted to try a Russian restaurant.  The ambiance was inviting and the service was excellent.  We tried some new things we had never tasted before.  The julien (mushroom appetizer) was superb.  We also ordered the tongue which tasted great with the horseradish.  We then ordered soup.  The borsch was very good as expected but the solianka was wonderful.  We both agreed that we would come back for that soup anytime.  I had the goulash.  Again another great dish.  The Napolean cake my partner ordered was decadent to say the least.  All in all, we will going back!"}
{"text":"My BF and I went here tonight and our food was good but the place was unaccommodating at best. Upon entering there were only two tables filled and the entire restaurant was silent. Very eerie and as we entered everyone was staring at us. One table continued to stare and make us uncomfortable until they left. After about 10 minutes some karaoke started that only one group was participating in and one guy got up and started making loud noises into the mic that management should have immediately stopped. I found a hair in my food that was blonde and I pointed this out to our waiter who brought it to management who immediately started accusing it was my hair, and that none of his cooking staff had long hair when I watched one of the staffs blonde girlfriend go into the kitchen right as we were ordering. Our waiter knew absolutely nothing of the menu when asked about simple ingredients in one of the salads and was even worse as a bartender."}
{"text":"Very good!  Potato and Onion Dumplings were amazing. All food here is scratch made. Try the appetizers and soup for a sampling.  Order the Napoleon cake. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, lovely service and reasonable prices. A solid neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"We never had russian cuisine and this is something new for us. We ordered beef stroganoff in orange / red sauce which is different from brown sauce of American version and i must say it was delicious. We also has lamb which you dip in a salsa type sauce (dont know what is called) and its excellent, meat is tender. The rice with vegetables is good and you could tell they prepare it from scratch.  Will definitely come back and recommend it with friends and family.  Oh our host is nice, he explained to us the menu since its out 1st time here."}
{"text":"6 of us went to this restaurant last night and we all loved it!  For appetizers we had the pelmini and mashed potato vereniki...both were absolutely delicious--I would suggest trying both if you don't know what to get for an appetizer. We each then had either borsch or solyanka...the people who had never been to Russia  or had Russian food before liked the borsch soup best. I tend to like borsch better too, but the solyanka tastes just like it does in Russia. For the main course, I had chicken Kiev which was amazing, while the others had a chicken sandwich, beef stroganoff, chicken fettuccine, and a small beef roll (to go with the soup). None of us had any complaints about the place and would definitely go again. Toward the end of the night, they started playing 70s music videos on the projector which was surprising since it was such a classy place, but it ended up being really fun and humorous at times!  I definitely suggest trying this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, since this is seriously around the corner from my home I have no excuses of not to come in. I will have to say the best Russian food ever. The stroganoff is supreme and the chicken fettuccine is pretty good. However, if you really don't have time to dine desserts here are off the hook. The honey cake is so moist and scrumptious that you will want to order one to take home. All in all wait staff is friendly and nice and attentive without being overbearing. Will definitely be adding this to our new hangout list for dinner and lunch."}
{"text":"Little jem with tasty home style cooking, lovely friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. My friend and I loved the soups (soljanka and borscht), beef tongue and pel'meni. Hope to visit again next time I am Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere.  Perfect place to have a good night out.  Try pork shish kebab simply excellent."}
{"text":"Super yummy authentic food. Nice atmosphere , clean . Great vodka selection, delicious borscht, mushrooms and dumplings"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas, I visit Cafe Mayakovsky. Unlike many American/Mexican restaurants, this place offers a very nice, upscale and quiet atmosphere. Beautiful decor and background music make you relax and feel good when you're inside. Oh, and by the way, Eastern European food is the best! You have many different items to choose from and everything is healthy, affordable and very, very delicious!"}
{"text":"Heard about Russian food and this restaurant, so I decided to give it a try, but I was deeply disappointed. First of all, it doesn't look like a restaurant, it looks like an eatery. The service was very slow and disgusting. There were only two waiters and they couldn't manage their orders on time. We had to wait fifteen minutes for our appetizers and they were very salty. We got our entrees after an hour of waiting but they brought the wrong order((( Instead of Beef Stroganoff they brought Chicken Kiev. Though they did say they would change my dish, I refused, cause I knew it would take another hour also.   However, the Chicken Kiev was not so bad as the service though...It wasn't what i've had before, but quite good. The prices are not so high, but I'll never be back again. BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!"}
{"text":"First off, why 4 stars - I have been spoiled by my mother :) Small, by Russian standards, place in the off strip mall, that back in 2008 was probably completely abandoned, so you get that little destitute feeling when you pull up, but.... if you are looking for decent Russian fair, definitely a place to try.  We, the wife and me, tried this place twice for lunch, but I doubt it's any worth for dinner. Food was dialed in just right, portions not overwhelmingly huge, like most Russian places trying to compete by size. Menu is pretty good variety and available on line, service with a smile, especially if you speak Rusian, JK - looks like they have this part figured pretty good too. So you can try at least couple of dishes and share with a second half if you wish. And yes, I did check out the bathroom, squeaky clean, just like it's suppose to be.  Btw, don't know what someone was saying about not easy to spot the place, my crippled phone GPS found it on the first try and that's unusual performance."}
{"text":"Cafe Mayakovsky clearly didn't get the memo that the quality of a Las Vegas establishment is evaluated purely by the number of lightbulbs attached to the facade.  But beneath its unassuming exterior lives one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. We started off our meal with pickled herring, perozki, mushroom blinchiki, and, of course, vodka. The house perozki are piping hot buns full of meat or dill potatoes. Although both types were very good, Mayakovsky's potato-filled buns were seasoned more flavorfully than their beef cousins. The blinchiki, too, was excellent -- but the pickled herring, on the other hand, might be classified as more of an acquired taste. (Apparently it's a traditional chaser for vodka?)  For our entrees, we ordered Chicken Tabaka, a whole roasted cornish hen served with raw vegetables. Mayavovsky's version of the dish was rubbed with garlic and crisped to perfection. And although service was leisurely, the Russian-speaking waitstaff was attentive and kept our bread and water full.  Forget the tourist t(c)raps -- This is Russian comfort food that's worth the trip from the strip."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Dont let the outside fool you. Great food, nice service. Friendly staff. Highly recommend you check it out. Looks great for parties or large groups. Ask about the live entertainment. Nazdarovia!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here randomly for lunch because we had a Groupon...glad we did.  Ulga waited on us and she was perfect.  Beautiful...charming and efficient.  We went with the borscht...schnizel...and stroganoff...all was great!  Thank you chef and Ulga...you guys are awesome!  Couple of vodka shots didnt hurt things either.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Russian food.  To me, it's soul food.  I was raised in an Eastern-European family, and my mother cooked Russian and Polish food.  Everything we had was hot, fresh, and as good as anything I have had in Russia or any of the old Soviet republics.  I was in Turkmenistan eight years ago, and the shashlik was as good as anything in Ashgabat.  They also make their own infused vodkas.  Saturday night is live Russian entertainment.  We will be going back at least once every couple of weeks.  I'll see you there.    !"}
{"text":"My third time here and I'll keep coming back. Here with my Russian girlfriend and she approves, so, I know it's good Russian food. I get the sour soup...and their coffee is amazing"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and exquisite, and they have vegan options!  The homemade mushroom crepes are absolutely delicious, they are garnished with sour cream but you can ask and they will serve them without it. We also tried their potato-onion Russian dumplings, very good as well.  They have a mushroom sandwich and some great salads that we will be trying next time. It is hard to find places with authentic, fresh and homemade food,  but this place has them all and the prices are great!  The Russian beers were also very good, we tried the number 3 and number 9 loger, the first one was my favorite. The place is new, nice and clean. The owner is an interesting cool guy and we enjoyed talking to him very much! We want to come back soon and bring friends to experience an exotic and authentic night out!  They have live Russian music on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"CAFE MAYAKOVSKI 1775 E TROPICANA, SUITE 30 LAS VEGAS, NV  We heard there was a Russian food restaurant in Vegas and since we have never had Russian food before, we wanted to try it.  We found a $25 off restaurant.com coupon and tried it out Friday night, July 17, 2015.  The restaurant has a Tropicana address but it's actually off the street a little bit at the end of a small outdoor mall of stores near the old Liberace Museum.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it was richly decorated and exceptionally clean (including the bathrooms).  There were five of us in attendance, four adults and one child.  We were promptly served ice water and menus.  We ordered sodas, and one of each of the Russian non-alcoholic drinks Mors ($2.95) a berry drink and Kvas ($2.95) which tasted like non-alcoholic beer.  And ordered two beers, Baltika 7 ($6) and Baltika 9 ($6.50).  Then two soups, Borsch ($5.95) a beet/beef and Solyanka ($8.95) a tomato/meats/sour cream.  Both were delicious but most of the table favored the Solyanka. Next was three appetizers:  Blinchiki Mushrooms ($6.95) crepes stuffed with mushrooms, Vareniki Potatoes ($5.95) dumplings stuffed with potatoes, and Julien ($6.95) mushrooms baked in a cream sauce with cheese.   All three were delicious and tasted very fresh made.  For the entre we ordered Beef Stroganoff and Schnitzel.  The Stroganoff is not made the American way with noodles.  It's pure beef, mushrooms and onions in a dark sauce.  Excellent!  But the Schnitzel was the favorite for everyone.  It's a pork cutlet lightly breaded, soooo tender and served with deliciously spiced skillet vegetables.  For dessert we tried Praga cake ($6.95) and Napoleon cake ($6.95) which tastes like cheese cake layered with puff pastry.  My son loved the Napoleon cake and almost ate the whole thing.  I don't know what authentic Russian food is suppose to taste like, but everyone liked what we received.  Our total bill was $112 with $25 coupon, so we paid $88 plus a $22 tip.  Service from our waitress Ludmila was excellent - 5 star Food was very good - 5 star Atmosphere very nice - 4 star (only because it was a bit dark) Value - worth every penny we paid - 5 star"}
{"text":"I went with my friend around mid-June. It was around noon, and we were the only ones there save a Russian couple and the waitress. The waitress appeared to be very occupied on a tablet - it took about 10 minutes for her to look up and finally seat us. The door was open - I remember tiny flies biting on my legs. It would've been better at night, but we both had plans.  Anyways, the food... Stuffed cabbage was quite good - I loooove cabbage. It came with an exceptional tomato-based sauce. In a world of many tomato-based sauces, this one stood out. I ordered lamb skewers. My friend ordered the schnitzel. The lamb came out a bit too dry, overcooked, whatever. The marinade was lacking as well. I regret ordering that. At first, the mashed potatoes looked questionable, but man, they were perfect - goosebumps good. The schnitzel was done as you'd expect.   The waitress more than made up for her prior inattentiveness. She was very friendly and personable, always checking on our drinks, very quick on her feet - both I and my friend thought she might have done gymnastics. Witty and pleasant, with both our table and the Russian couple's.  Atmosphere: 2.7 (+0.4 to make up for time of day) Food: 3.7 Service: 3.8 Overall: 3.5 - I rounded up to 4, because it was a memorable experience."}
{"text":"For fans of true Russian food, you can't beat this place.  We were the only non-Russians among the twelve people there the night we Ubered out.  While not near the casinos, it's definitely worth the ride. We started with a traditional berry juice, tasty and sweet with mixed berry flavor not sugar. Stuffed cabbage rolls with a meat filling could have been dinner for a small child- 4 to a plate covered with a delicious sauce and sour cream. Our other appetizer was a bowl of small raviolis in a buttery herb sauce. Again, they tasted homemade.  The small Russian salad of chopped up tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, radishes and another veggie or two with a light vinaigrette dressing cleared our palate for the borsht (beet and other veggies) soup. Light with enough beet to taste its special flavor but not so much as to overpower the other flavors.  We opted for traditional stroganoff and goulash as our entrees. The beef stroganoff captured the earthy flavor of the mushroom and onion base and kicked it up a notch with the tender strips of beef. Usually the sauce is made too rich with sour cream added in; this was light and flavorful.The goulash was a stew with carrots, potatoes, and chucks of meat. All melt in your mouth.  While we declined to try the honey cake, our chocolate cake was a true European version. Rich and dark but not sugary, the filling was a custard and the frosting more like a thin layer of fudge, just enough contrast to enjoy the tastes and texture mixes. A memorable experience and one I would return for again."}
{"text":"I've never eaten Russian food before. As it turns out, I am not a fan of it. However, Café Mayakovsky is a great place. It has a nice \"Russian\" décor and a good staff. The dish that my group liked best was the beef stroganoff. The chicken kiev was fine, but didn't come with much seasoning (which I what I would expect from the reputation of Russian food). The beers and vodka from Russia are numbered, and I loved the #4, which also came in a really cool bottle. So, minus one star (only because my personal taste is food with kick). I would go again for the experience and the drinks!"}
{"text":"We took our guests, native Belarusians to dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the service of our waitress Ludmila,  the quality and authenticity of the food. Portion sizes were large and the entertainment was a pleasant surprise. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a first for me!  I was able to meet up with some wonderful people here to try Russian food.  We were lucky enough to have someone with Russian decent to inform us on the various options and what to expect.  The dining area is very clean and open. There was a tv playing 'adult' viewing so I would not recommend bringing a family into this establishment.   Service here started off good but then trailed off. We had ordered appetizers and at that time were still deciding on entrees.  Our waiter really wanted us to order right away and take the menus.  After our appetizers were finished,  we had to wave him down to place the entree order and also later to pay the bill.  I wasn't impressed.    Now regarding the food~  The Hot appetizers were wonderful.  I loved the Julien which was mushrooms and a cream sauce.  It wasn't overly heavy but still had a fantastic flavor.  The Golubtshy was also a very flavorful cabbage roll stuffed with beef. The cold appetizer of herring was ok.  It was very very salty but the potatoes which accompanied it were simple and delicious.  The  Stolichniy was also a good cold appetizer.  Its a version of potato salad with a distinct dill flavor. My entree, the Shashlik Lamb, was ok.  Simple but overcooked and very tough to eat.  The mashed potatoes which accompanied it were good but I was hoping more from the Lamb.    I had heard better things from Cafe Mayakovsky so I'm hoping to give it another shot and get better results."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, the server kind and knowledgeable,  great atmosphere. The borscht soup, vareniki was fantastic, the beef stroganoff was buttery creamy seasoned goodness. A must try if your in town!"}
{"text":"I saw a yelp deal and stepped in. This is a family owned Russian restaurant. I asked unique Russian food, the beef skewer and the veggie mushroom. Both are very delicious. For the food I gonna give 4 stars but the service is very good so boost up to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I came in at about 3 and it wasn't at all busy. The ambiance is cozy and inviting. Regular soothing jazz plays throughout the establishment. There's also a happy medium between too bright and too dim; it's just the right amount of light. I had the Chicken Kiev with vegetables. The vegetables were sliced in such an aesthetically-pleasing that I almost didn't want to eat them. They tasted just as great as they looked. And the Chicken Kiev was excellent. I couldn't figure out all of the spices that made it so special but I can tell you, without a doubt, it was. I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is unique. They make you feel like you're at home. And the food is amazing! The beef stroganoff is the best! Will definately be coming back again!"}
{"text":"For someone that is really not familiar with Russian traditional restaurant this place may seem ok , but for me , someone who came from Russia a while ago , this place is not even close to be called Restaurant!!!  No food presentation, no customer service , out of menu items , unfriendly atmosphere! need to add that Menegment need to learn also how to properly handle unhappy costumers reviews  ! Really sad that my American friends will think this is what Russian restaurant is about !"}
{"text":"My 1st time eating Russian food. I got to say everything we try was amazing.   I can add this to my done list"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Russian food- taste is spot on, dishes offered are diverse, and prices are comfortable. Location is close to the Strip, convenient to locals and foreign tourists alike. I'm really hoping they succeed, as most of their food can't be found elsewhere!  Menu offers several hot and cold appetizers, get several for the table to try. HERRING: cold app served with potatoes, hardboiled egg, dill, and onion. So fresh, so tasty, must-order. $9 MAMALIGUTA: a peasant dish made of corn polenta, Russian feta, and sour cream. Odd but complementary combination of flavors and textures. $7 JULIEN: baked mushrooms in cream sauce, topped with cheese. This mixture is available in other dishes/apps and is a large part of Russian cuisine. $8 SOLYANKA: the other famous Russian soup, packed with sausage. Borscht is also available of course but I generally prefer this one.  Entree options include traditional stroganoff and chicken kiev, as well as representative dishes from other nearby cultures: Hungarian goulash, Viennese schnitzel.  SHASHLIK: grilled pork, beef, or lamb served with a tasty tomato-based house sauce. Cooked to your preferred doneness, ample sharing portion. $16  Dessert: there are a few dessert options, but this place is known for their \"honey cake\" (AKA Napoleon cake), a creamy puff-pastry concoction that I don't usually like- though I have not had the version served here. Opted instead for the ZAPAKANKA: Similar to a baked cheesecake and served with whipped cream and cherries, this is a traditional dish that American sugar enthusiasts may find on the bland side. The delicate cake is not sweet and dense but light and airy instead.  I have not yet tried the entire menu, but I'm impressed enough to give five stars and be tentatively planning a UYE here- they also have a bar and a karaoke stage, and will eventually be open tip 4AM for crazy European dance parties!  EDIT: Dropping my star rating. Had the aforementioned UYE here, after making email reservations directly with the owner. Despite bringing in a group and making a personal connection with the owner, service was slow and disinterested and food was a drop in quality. I was embarrassed and disappointed to have raved about this spot prior to bringing other Yelp Elites. Also, they were playing softcore porn during our meal, WTF?! Still many tasty options, and a good place to try Russian cuisine, but they lack consistency."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and I keep coming back whenever I'm in Las Vegas.  Service is good and food is very good.  Vodka is \"prepared to your taste preference\"  If this is what you grew up eating, you'll be pleased (as I was)  If you want to try something new...go for it!"}
{"text":"Authentic Russian food in a beautiful environment. From the ceilings to the floors you feel like you are in a truly upscale, classy, European-esque place, evidently recently rebuilt or freshly renovated. Add the Russian art, a stage, and a bar, and this could easily be a restaurant somewhere in Russia or Eastern Europe. The food is truly authentic, very good, and reasonably priced. We particularly liked the Pelmeni and Russian salad, but I don't think you can go wrong. This is a real gem, highly recommend you stop by when in Las Vegas if you're looking to experience authentic Russian food, I know we will on our next trip."}
{"text":"I like to come in for the Borscht.  Mashed potatoes are good as well as the imported beers.  I have tried about half the menu and have not had a bad meal yet.  I highly recommend you come in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 4 stars, because i think my food was just okay but not delicious. I really liked marinated mushrooms, but vareniki with cottage cheese was just okay. Berries mors tasted kinda weird. But I really liked our waitress Svetlana , she was really nice and attentive. So I would recommend you to visit this place because I think that's cool that there is simple little cafe like this in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh my!!  My taste buds were delighted.    Beverage: MORS/MOPC (Wild Berries Drink)  Salad: Russian Salad (Sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, radish green onion tossed in house dressing and chopped dill - no lettuce)  Entree: Lamb Shashlik (Skewered and marinated then cooked on the grill)  Dessert: Honey Cake   Everything I experienced was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG best russian restaurant ever!  Great prices Amazing authentic home made tasty food Wonderful setting and music"}
{"text":"Every single thing we ordered, which was a lot, was delicious. Service was outstanding as well. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!!! I was feeling under the weather and craving borsch soup. They nailed it!! I also got the snitzle and it was delicious. I carried out and everything was perfect when I got home. I can't wait to go in and dine!!"}
{"text":"This place has the slowest service EVER!!!! Food took over an hour to come out. If you are looking for good service, this isn't the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, and wonderful atmosphere.   Food is very authentic, very exquisite, and real.  2nd time here and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"The best food ever!!! If you are looking for a quality food - that's tha place to go. Everything was hevenly delicious - definitely reccomend!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Eastern European cuisine. Was good, not great, but it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"The restaurant was large, dark and mostly deserted. As I sat alone at my table I felt very small. Then my waiter showed up. He was so warm and friendly that I no longer felt out if place. I asked him to just bring me his favorite entree and appetizer, and he was happy to oblige.   My meal started with a potato dumpling, which was delicate and flavorful. The main course was the fish with a pasta side. It seemed like a lot of starch, but that's what my waiter liked, and it was very good.  I must have been early because it wasn't long before the restaurant started filling up. By the time the meal was finished I was especially glad I went."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to your opening, the first time, you had one employee, he was the waiter and the chef, ? I guess you didn't anticipate any business, I can see why. There were 4 of us the second time we revisited, well it has not improve aside from hiring the second employee, she was the hostess and the waitress, moving up into the world of dining. You can keep your place of business, no one likes rude manager on top of lack of food to sell."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night with a party of three. It was pretty quiet, but the place, while unassuming from outside, was very nice inside. Modern and clean. The waiter looked a lot like Vladimir Putin.   We ordered borsch soup to start (beet and beef soup). It was very tasty. For dinner we had beef stroganoff and goulash. Both dishes were very good. I had the goulash, and while the meat was too fatty for my liking, I was able to trim it down and enjoyed the meal very much. The meat was very tender and the flavores were excellent. I ordered it with Russian style pan fried potatoes, which I would recommend. Yum!  My aunt and uncle had the beef stroganoff. The meat was finely chopped into the sauce, which at first was confusing because we are used to cubed beef in a stroganoff. However, once you start eating, your taste buds reward you for trusting the chef. Delicious, and the better of the two meals.   A couple of Russian beers, and we were all happy. My aunt and uncle are Czech and speak Russian, but no English. They were able to talk to the waiter and order in Russian, which made it a nice experience."}
{"text":"Traditional Russian place with great authentic food and wonderful customer service, the owner is always friendly. We love the place and enjoy going there."}
{"text":"Located off Spencer and Tropicana, it's located in a strip mall with a nondescript sign.. it's pretty roomy inside but a little on the dark side. The waitress was very helpful. I ordered Borscht, tongue, and herring salad. The borscht kind reminded me of minestrone but I haven't had it in so long that it tasted good. The pickled herring with potatoes and eggs were good. It has to be my favorite at this time. The beef tongue was tender but needed a little salt.  Prices are also affordable... It has been a while since I've had this that it's hard to make comparisons... I would recommend it for a new taste experience for those who have not had Russian dishes. I will be back...."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! My wife is from Russian and we love this place. Great service, fun atmosphere of you love Russian food or want to try some, then eat here. When we come to town we always stop by for dinner and lunch!! You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Place looks nice but food is cold and very low quality. Nice waitress but waiter was clueless about what the restaurant offered took so long to order because he had to keep running to the back to answer question. Turkish coffee was disgusting and served I. A regular coffee cup. I don't think they know what Turkish coffee is."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Don't let the strip mall appearance fool you.  The restaurant is genuine, the food is fantastic and the service was friendly and fast.  Everyone in my party felt the same.  The food is savory, different and generous.  Want something out of the usual?  Try this place, I'm sure you will come out smiling."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday celebration on a Thursday night.  We ordered Russian Vodka by the bottle and the Russian beer was good!  The food was ok.  We had a great time.  Thursday nights are comic night, we didn't know, but enjoyed it (not for kids).  After they were done it turned into a fun dancing night with a DJ.  Very fun and unique night, however the Russian Vodka sure did amp up the night!"}
{"text":"My husband found an ad on Groupon for this restaurant and we were curious. I had never had Russian food (only Americanized Russian) and my husband had a bit more knowledge of it, due to him spending some time near there. So we went there last night on a whim.  And boy am I glad we did.  Great food, Awesome service.   Was a little hard to find and it is pretty unassuming on the outside.  It was very quiet inside and not very full. It's very comfortable, and there is a small stage, where we assume there is live entertainment.   The service was great.  Our server had it perfectly timed to where as soon as we were done with one course, the next came out.  We got a Russian Salad, that was so incredibly fresh and delicious.  I could take bowls of this home and never have enough.  We next got the Vareniki with the mashed potatoes and onions.  Again, delicious.  For our main course, my husband got the Chicken Kiev and i got the Beef Stroganoff, Both great, and we ate so much, we almost had to roll out of there."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service in this place!  We had pelmeni (meat dumplings), stuffed cabbage, borscht and herring with potatoes. Everything was fresh and homemade. Stuffed cabbage was so delicate and delicious, the best I ever had in a restaurant. Since I grew up eating Russian food, this should tell you how good their food is. Our waitress was very friendly, explained details about the menu and was quick to bring our orders. Their location is in a large strip mall, plenty of parking. Sounds like there is live music on Saturday nights.  Will definitely be back to sample more of their awesome dishes."}
{"text":"Place was bomb, a bit on the higher price for the area but well worth it. You get what you pay for and they are in no way a let down. 10/yes"}
{"text":"New love in Vegas. The pilmeni taste really close to my Grandmother's... All the food was delicious!!?"}
{"text":"I'm from New York where there is some great Russian food and I have to say this is \"better than a memory\".  The Borscht was the best I've ever had, the VARENIKI and PEROZKI were delicious, and the traditional Russian drinks were great.  We were there during the super bowl so it was kind of empty but you can tell the food is extremely fresh and the server (Ludmila) was very accommodating and took great care of us.  We will be back at least once a month."}
{"text":"The food was superb Will return for more Server was superb All 4dinners earned a 5 rating"}
{"text":"I had the mushroom crepes with great mushroom flavor. I let my husband have a bite. It's actually a hot appetizer but I wanted something light and amazingly good. My husband had the beef tongue which he said was flavored with a marinade of cucumber and horseradish. He followed it with the beef stroganoff which he said was almost perfect, just needed a touch more sour cream. We ended the night with coffee and honey cake. Honey cake is delicious with fresh coffee by the way. Our waitress was a blonde haired young lady who have impeccable service and I wish I'd gotten her name. Live music. Wonderful singer and a dance floor. The only downside was the volume was way too loud for the size of the venue. Almost loud enough to knock them down to a 4."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years now, and I always love it. The food is great - definitely try some solyanka soup, russian salad, and pelmeni! We always try new dishes and I always enjoy them. They also have two traditional, non-alcoholic Russian drinks - kvas and mors, which are super good too.   The ambiance varies from ok to awesome, depending on who is there. Sometimes on weekend evenings they have a live singer. Yesterday we had a young singer performing Russian pop songs and it was so much fun! She was the best performer we have seen for sure.   Prices are really reasonable, as are portion sizes. Service is good, especially if the restaurant is not too full."}
{"text":"Music was slightly repetitive, but literally every other aspect was spot on. The food was awesome, service was quick, i got to practice Russian, and the staff was fun and talkative."}
{"text":"Came here around 3pm yesterday, there was no one in there. The restaurant is in a sketchy neighborhood, but the food turned out to be surprisingly good. We ordered meat ravioli(forgot the name of the dish), borscht soup, and beef stroganoff. Both ravioli and beef stroganoff were 5star dishes, but borscht soup was a bit on the watery side. The restaurant was kinda hot, they need to turn up the AC more. I'll definitely come back here when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"We chose on a whim to reunite with an old favorite of ours.  Russian.  We wanted Russian grub.  With warm tastebuded memories of an old dear restaurant we used to dine 12 years ago on the Westside, Mayakovsky capitalized on this wanton desire.    Located at the southern corner of what used to be the Liberace Museum.  The location is kind of a counter culture shock for some.  It is a unique place to get your taste of commie cuisine.  I try.  In any case the place is pretty cool inside.  Dark and somewhat cold, the atmosphere really takes me to places I thought it would feel like in the urban sickle & hammer streets.  Our host was a very welcoming sweet gal.  Our server for the evening was a friendly gentleman who was engaging and had a pinch of Putin to him.  I have to say if this is your first time trying Russian food he would be perfect to guide you through it.  They are willing to divulge any information regarding the menu with out interrogation.  We are no rookies though.  The entrees consist of a well prepared protein surrounded by potatoes mashed, pan fried or fries and a vegetable.  As we were used to they would have been steamed or raw vegetables, yet at Mayakovsky it is a cole-slaw-esque salad instead.  We were informed real Russians eat their potatoes mashed!  So, when in Moscow..   We started with the red caviar.  A traditional plate of plain crepes with butter and salmon roe.  Think of it as a salty Russian jam of sorts.  Definitely not in Kansas anymore Toto.  As always I would suggest ordering one shot of the premium vodka that I couldn't pronounce properly and take it just before you dive into the appetizer.  Soft and sea flavoured I know this is not for everyone, but there's a reason you didn't choose to go Dennys right?  Her entree was the Chicken Kiev.  A rolled and breaded tube of poultry goodness.  I suggest slicing it in inches and slanting it for a nice presentation.  It's like a non pansy le cordon bleu.  She wanted the pan fried potatoes but she was served fries.  She did like the fries though.  I suppose it's what our soviet cousins think us 'Mericans would've chosen, lol.  I had the encrusted trout.  Which was almost a whole trout minus the head.  This was my very first trout!  Being of Micronesian decent I usually order more exotic saltwater variety.  I loved it.  Crispy skinned and tender fillets.  I ate the whole fish with my manly mashed potatoes.    For dessert we asked for the Napoleon cake.  Which came out exactly 1.5 minutes after asking for it.  Powdered sugar and 2 forks to share.  If I may suggest, do ask for a knife.  Its a like a puff pastry and a cheesecake sharing equal provided plate space.  So good!  At the end I dropped the missile on our waiter about the Yelp $20 for $10 deal that I had purchased as soon as I checked in and was seated.  A great 3 course meal for under 50 bucks before leaving a 20% tip (I'm a 20% tipper) I was more than satisfied.  A good meal with great authentic ruskie service.  I had as much fun dining at Mayakovsky as I did writing this review."}
{"text":"Yum. Awesome food. Great prices! Clean and cozy. Staff was quick and nice. My hubby is russian and hard to please food wise... he loved it. 5 stars. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night around 9:45 for a late dinner. We were leery at first, because of the empty parking lot, but we ended up really glad that we went!   I knew what I wanted as soon as I saw that there was a Russian restaurant nearby - varenyky and borscht. Both were delicious. I got the potato varenyky, which were seasoned with dill, and served with sour cream and caramelized onion. Though I tend to like exponentially more of both, the plate was  artfully arranged, and I enjoyed the varenyky very much. The borscht was also tasty - hearty, with not too much meat, which is a good thing in my book. The bread our server brought was excellent dipped in the borscht. I ate until I couldn't fit another bite, and was sad I couldn't finish it all!  Initially, my boyfriend was not terribly enthusiastic about my choice in cuisine, but he ended up really enjoying his pork shashlik. It came with a flavorful sauce reminiscent of salsa, which nicely complemented the seasoning of the pork.   We also ordered one of each of the piroshki - beef, cabbage, and potato. We enjoyed all three. The beef looked unassuming, but had a nice flavor and consistency. The potato filling was full of dill, like the varenyky. The cabbage was my favorite, though I wasn't able to put my finger on what it was seasoned with.   For drinks, we both got iced tea, which I cannot recommend highly enough! It was so good!   Overall, I was really pleased, and we are both looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First time for Russian food, and really enjoyed it! Good experience. Cafe Mayakovsky is pretty good. Would love to try the rest of menu. Try it!"}
{"text":"Service was great, water was refilled even before it got halfway empty, BUT we were the only ones having lunch here. It definitely is VERY dark, so your eyes do take a while to adjust to the darkness.  My friend who is Russian came here with her family and she ordered a bunch of dishes for us to share. There were 3 people in the party and we got full pretty fast. We were given bread rolls with butter when we sat down. We ordered the cabbage rolls, the cottage cheese crepes, marinated mushrooms, beef stroganoff, and lamb kabobs. Our appetizers came out first. There were 3 small cabbage rolls, 2 crepes and a good amount of mushrooms. The cottage cheese crepes were surprisingly good! They were a little sweet, and the crepe was soft. The cabbage rolls had a good amount of meat but were kind of small and they definitely need to give a spoon with that dish so the sauce could be scooped out. The marinated mushrooms were fresh, and marinated with vinegar but the vinegar wasn't overwhelming. The lamb kabobs are THE BEST LAMB KABOBS I HAVE EVER HAD. It was a little tough, but seasoned well, cooked perfectly and didn't have a weird aftertaste. The only bad dish was the beef stroganoff, which we had to send back because it was wayyyy too salty. It took them a while to remake the dish but it was much better.   Our bill was around $54. Make sure you check groupon! They have a $20 voucher for only $10!! After the groupon was applied, it was only $34."}
{"text":"Not much to look at on the outside but the inside is nice and clean. Food was good too. Reasonable priced. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Great place! Seledka pod shuboy and the Napoleon cake were amazing!"}
{"text":"Had tons of food using the Groupon. EVERYTHING was delicious, including the salad and borsch! Tasted very authentic to me, and was better than any food I had in Russia. The service was friendly and fast. Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Food meh, at best. And a bit worse than meh, given the prices. Here's the breakdown. -I love perozki and have been jonesing since leaving California--have loved pierogis in New York even more. However-----what arrived was *literally* 2 large brown dinner rolls made of bread---wtf?---no delicious dumplings with a drizzle of sour cream anywhere in sight!  One of these thick dinner rolls contained somewhat flavorful potato and the other what tasted to be boiled minced meat.  Both were SO dry I couldn't eat more than half of the potato and 1 bite of the meat. These were NOT perozki----and did not even look anything like photos on review sites like this one. - Praga Cake was NOT a proper Praga Cake. More like chocolate *bread* with 3 layers.  It was bizarre. There's a very specific butter cream associated with Praga Cake and it was nowhere to be found. Instead a sickly sweet artificial chocolate tasting gummy mousse between layers. Tasted like a supermarket \"bakery\" product, although it was clearly made there. Just not done well, or right. Ate about 1/2 of it and felt ill---way too syrupy, and too much almond extract (which isn't even part of the recipe). - Beef Stroganoff: NOT a proper stroganoff. The mushrooms were good, but sadly, the sauce was C+ and no better--bland and salty. The beef was not the delicious sliced beef you expect from a stroganoff--but that same dry boiled minced beef that was in the faux-perozki. The mashed potatoes, however, were delicious! - Ordered online. Was treating myself since the delivery charge was really expensive ($9!!!!!)."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy quality food, and a wide variety of Russian shots!!!! Their food is crafted with perfection, while preserving the Russian style and taste of a traditional Russian restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the spot n location quiet in corner good service very nice Russian trad. food n affordable. There's only few Russian restaurants in city so I like it they got music too."}
{"text":"This is the best Russian food in Las Vegas and it's close to the strip. I had a great dinner the service was excellent and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant on Groupon and today was lunch there for the first time. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive. Never really got to the main courses because the appetizers were THAT GOOD!!!! Blinchiki received high marks but vareniki was TO DIE FOR!!!! I enjoyed them so much the server had the manager come out and he entertained my interest in preparing a large order which I could have frozen for my personal stash!!!!  If you don't know where to look you might very well miss it but worth the effort to find it at the back of the old Liberace plaza....next time dinner and the MAIN COURSES (and vareniki of course)!  FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving Russian food while on vacation on the strip and found this place on Yelp. It's a bit of a drive from the strip and rather hard to find, but I thought it was worth the ride, especially since I was in the mood for some Russian pelmeni!   The service was outstanding, really - from the waitress, who was understanding, accommodating and pleasant to the fullest extent, to the owner who stopped by and greeted us. Everyone was amazingly nice and added to our experience here.  The food was mediocre, not the best Russian food I have had, which was a bit disappointing. We got the Julien, which was nice and probably one of the better dishes we had. I thought it could use a bit more cheese and would have been nicer if it was a little hotter, with the cheese fully melted.   We also had the Pelmeni - it was great, could use a little bit more salt and flavor, and I wish they had it as an entreé on its own instead of just as an appetizer. I generally like my pelmeni in a soup, in a large bowl as the main dish of my meal.   The borsch was so so, it was a bit lukewarm, lacked salt and seemed to be a bit overcooked since the cabbage slices melted in my mouth - it's usually better when they're a bit crunchier and feel freshly made. The cubed meat inside the borsch took me by surprise, I would rather have a bone cut as is done traditionally.  The pirozki were ok; I thought the bread was too much for the amount of meat and potatoes. The dough and the stuffing could have been a bit saltier as well.   The napoleon could have been much better. The trick that I have seen other chefs use is to make it to order, that is, put the custard and the layers together right before serving the napoleon. This adds just enough crunch to the cake and keeps the custard light. The one I had was clearly made some time ago and the custard was dehydrated and dry.   That said, I will probably be back on my next visit, I would like to try some of their entrees, namely the beef stroganoff and the shashlik."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend and we were happy with our experience.  First, the place is located on Tropicana Ave, not too far away from the strip so no problem getting there. Service was decently good and fast and they have a good selection of alcohols including European ones.  We ordered a few different items such as the chicken Kiev, a few pirozkis, etc... and everything was very good. My only problem with this place is that it is rather expensive for the portions you get, and I ended up leaving hungry which I am not a fan of in restaurants in general. That said the food really was pretty good.  In conclusion, you should give this place a try if you want to discover Russian/Eastern European Cuisine. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  Food and service were spot on.  The waiter was really nice and even gave us a mini history lesson about Russia. You can tell the chef really takes pride in the quality and presentation of the dishes.  Nothing looked thrown together,  but dishes were carefully displayed. I will come back again. ..no doubt about that."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night around 6:30pm. Some tables were filled but most were not. The food was good but the inside needed better lighting or something.   PROS: Pork schnitzel            Julien - mushrooms, cream and cheese             CONS: Chicken Kiev - dry  I liked the food but not enough to return again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was excellent! I miss authentic Russian food and this place took me back. Loved the Russian champagne as well. Got me a little bit tipsy. ;-) The first night we were there, one of the workers had her daughter with her. I'm not sure if she is one of the owners or what, but I don't think it's a good practice to bring your kid to a restaurant and allow her to run around.   I would come back here next time we are in Vegas. Great atmosphere and really good food. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing russian food. I had the Lamb Sashlik and Napoleon Cake. Both well surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  Mayakovsky is located in eastside Vegas in an unassuming shopping complex.  I came at about 8pm on a Saturday and it was literally empty except for a couple sitting in a booth.  They had a stage for supposed musical acts and about 60 seats in the restaurant, but clearly Saturday night was not their busy time.  I came because I found a Groupon for $10 off and found the reviews to be quite good.  We tried the skewered chicken, goulash, and pierogis.  The goulash and chicken were served in the same format of the meat accompanied with mashed potatoes, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  Both dishes were very average in my opinion.  I have never been to Russia so have no idea about the authenticity, but I always envision goulash the Eastern European way - in soup form.  But these dishes were exactly the same just different meat/sauce, similar to how Thai and Chinese restaurants have very similar accompaniments and then just plant a different meat on the top.  But I do have rave reviews for the pierogis which were exceptional, filled with mashed potatoes and onion and lightly covered in sour cream.    The prices were very fair with the 3 dishes coming to about $23 and were filling for a meal.  They have a full bar and I expect their vodka selection to be top notch but we didn't drink while there.  I do enjoy this type of cuisine every once in a while, but I thought the meals were too neat and repetitive rather than imaginary.  They do have good deals, however, so I could be back to try their chicken kiev specialty and give Mayakovski a second try."}
{"text":"Have only positive things to say about this place: My hubs and I shared pelmeni, borsch and salad stolichnyj and everything was delicious, lots of flavor. Our server was friendly and attentive. They also had live music, mainly Russian and the singer was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and service was fast. We got pelmeni and seledka pod shuboi which were excellent. Other dishes were also good. The only thing that was lacking was ambience. There was no music, and you could hear other people eat."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food and surprisingly fast delivery.  We ordered 5 dishes and each one was perfect.  You can't go wrong with this authentic Russian restaurant."}
{"text":"I had Cafe Mayakovsky bookmarked for quite some time, so I was glad that I was finally able to try it! I happened to be flying out to California for the weekend, and Cafe Mayakovsky is close to McCarran Airport, so I came on Friday night before my flight.  The plaza is a bit dilapidated, but there is plenty of parking and the restaurant itself is fine. Not super fancy inside, but it's the food that matters. I came with my Russian co-intern, who enjoyed conversing with our waiter in Russian. My friend also ordered all of our food since he was familiar with all the dishes.  My friend said that all of the food was very overpriced (our bill came out to $60 for two), but I guess there isn't much Russian food in Las Vegas. The food was tasty and authentic in my opinion though. Service was also decent.  I would recommend coming to try something different!"}
{"text":"Great Russian place in Las Vegas. This place is located in the old Carluccio's in the old Liberace Museum Plaza. Great food and they have this awesome mors berry drink. Prices not bad for Russian food."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The service isn't bad but it isn't super fast, which is normal in other countries. I will be coming back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! It's one of the places that you wouldn't have found, unless it was by word of mouth or Yelp!  The beef stroganoff and chicken Kiev was outstanding.   Classic, but modern interior for perfect ambience.  Excellent service and very kind wait staff.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Never had Russian food before. Great selection great service great food. Will go back again."}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place before when it's so affordable, close to school, and Russian, out of all things?   Mayakovsky is located in a rather abandoned-looking plaza, but looks very trendy on the inside. There is a small stage, several booths, tables, and a big bar in here that all contribute to a rather welcoming atmosphere.   Our waitress was extremely welcoming and attentive and immediately brought us water and menus when we sat down. The only Russian food I'd eaten so far had been in Germany, so I was excited to see if this restaurant would have any American influences in its food. Sure enough, New York Steak, and Ribeye were options on the menu. Not that that's a bad thing! For something more authentically Russian, I ordered the Blinchiki as an appetizer and the Chicken Kiev as my main entrée. My friend got the Beef Stroganoff, which was juicy and all around delightful.   The service was impeccable throughout our meal. Whenever our server wasn't at our table, she was polishing glasses at the bar while keeping an eye on us. She was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes served and could describe in detail how they are prepared.  We finished the meal with honey cake. It was a little bit too sweet for my taste, but I could see the effort that had gone into each of its many layers.   Our server also told us that they do take-out and groupon deals. Definitely something to watch out for. I can't wait to tell my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends. It is my 2nd time, the 1st time was at their previous location. This is located in Tropicana and this is their webcite http://www.cafemayakovsky.com/menu They served a lot of Russian food on their menu, some Hungarian.  I ordered Russian salad which was very good and filing. It consists of Sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, radish green onion tossed in house dressing and chopped dill. I also had Red Cavier- it was ok and was a little fishy. It came with pita bread. The Napoleon cake was delicious.  The price of appetizer and salad were reasonable and the entrees were little bit on the higher side. The place was tastefully decorated and clean. The service was good. The waitress took her time to describe the dishes and answer any questions. If you go on the weekend there is a live band. I liked the Russian background music. Overall, everyone had a good experience."}
{"text":"You will be addicted once you go to this place once. The food is authentic, homemade Russian food. Absolutely delicious. They have incredible borscht. The caviar is great. The dumplings are to die for and the service is excellent. They are the only game in town when it comes to Russian restaurants. The prices are incredibly reasonable for the level of food and the service that you receive. I've been here on a Thursday and a Saturday. On both nights, they had great live entertainment! On Thursday night, they had a hilarious comedy show and then on Saturday, they have a wonderful and beautiful Russian singer with a terrific voice. I recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas. Little known fact. This restaurant was also Liberace's old restaurant."}
{"text":"You get to Moscow by going to this cafe, but without the trouble or the chill. (Or the conspiracy). Happy to report that in this instance, the Russians did do it! Served a DELICIOUS meal with minimal fuss or pomp. The outside does not represent the elegance and class (and intrigue/mystique) of the inside. You will just have to trust us on that, and go inside. It transports you to 1950s Moscow to a restaurant on the corner near your apartment. Settle down for homemade borscht, chicken kiev, beef stroganoff, and all your other favorites, that you didn't even know were your favorites or were Russian. The cafe also presents nonalcoholic beverages from Russia that will delight you."}
{"text":"My other half and I had a Groupon for this place, and I was dying to try the beef stroganoff.  We went there Friday night, and we savored a very tasty Russian repast. The golubsty appetizer practically melts in your mouth, and the garlicky sauce that goes with it makes a perfect dip for the complimentary fresh bread provided.  My other half ordered the stolichniy salad, and she praised the quality and freshness. She told me she grew up with friends who made Russian food, so she's qualified to judge. She also loved the beef pirozki, saying it was not at all as greasy as the homemade versions she's had before.  I found the stroganoff to be outstanding and I definitely will be back for more. We both liked the quiet ambiance for a Friday night, as we both hate shouting over loud music (or loud patrons) during our meal.  This place is kinda hidden in the same spot where the Liberace museum used to be, so I would classify it as a \"hidden gem.\" Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Service: although friendnly the promptnest is severely lacking  Food: very tasty but my one of scoop of mash potatoes was cold while the other was somewhat warm  Wine: for 8 dollar at a local bar, I expect a regular pour. The pour was a smidge over a wine tasting  Beer: good tasting and strong Russian beer  Atmosphere: nothing to write home about but the booths were comfortable.  The only thing I enjoyed was the authentic Russian food."}
{"text":"A must if you love Russian cuisine.  The beef stroganoff was the best I ever had!  The food took longer than expected, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, and pleasant staff.  The food tasted great.  I strongly recommend this place if you are interested in authentic Russian cuisine."}
{"text":"Excellent, very attentive service combined with delicious, well-priced food make this place a great choice. From the borscht to the Russian salad to the schnitzel to the Napoleon cake to the Russian beer to our waitress, everything was of the highest quality. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This was my first Russian cuisine experience! The food was amazing and the service was prompt. We got the chicken Kev and beef stroganoff - both amazing! Also all the appetizers are made from scratch - I loved that!  I highly recommend coming here :)"}
{"text":"What a nice little gem of a find.  Russian cuisine is not overly popular in the US, so when my coworker Who is Russian mentioned to me about this restaurant I just had to try it. We came here on a weekday for lunch and ordered a couple different dishes to share. The food was definitely very unique, and delicious. There was several of the fish dishes that we enjoyed very much but can't even pronounce her name's. And Russian cuisine also features a lot of potatoes in their dishes and even though I'm not a huge fan of potatoes, the way they make it and season it makes the dishes taste so much better.  The service was very attentive and nice. Our waiter had a very heavy Russian accent and I appreciate that it is very authentic. The restaurant is very clean and so are the bathrooms. Parking is very easy in the lot."}
{"text":"Very nice and welcoming host explain the differences between Russian cuisines and different origins of the food and how they differ from Western cuisine. Have the caviar with crepes borscht soup and the lamb and the complimentary shot of vodka using the Yelp check-in! Highly recommended and we learned a lot and tasted a lot of different foods will be back again in the future when we are back in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My husband over the years has helped me expand my horizons and enjoy foods from other countries. I have tried several Russian restaurants in town, and none of them are as good as this one! They have discounts like from Groupon  you can take advantage of, but in general they are not expensive at all! I have loved every dish that had come out of their kitchen. A jewel of a restaurant in this town, if you ask me!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a wonderful experience.  The food and service were amazing.  Thanks Lisa! The atmosphere was great for our small group gathering. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Russian restaurant before, so I'm glad my first time was here. The food was delicious and the vodka was strong. I had the beef stroganoff and it was the best choice I could've made. I would definitely come back again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Went there with a groupon on a saturday night and there were only two tables with people besides us.  The food was really ordinary, bland and slightly warm.  My husband is Russian so he knows this kind of food and even he said it was not very good.  I think the worst part was when some lady with bleached blonde hair turned on some music so loud we could not even talk to each other and then she started to sing and it was so bad.  So loud, it made no sense why she would put the music on so loud.  We could not get out of there fast enough.  The food is really not very good at all."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Everything served so pretty too. Very friendly stuff. Everything fresh and you can tell the owner of the place really care about his restaurant."}
{"text":"Best place to try Russian food in Vegas! Beautiful design and great accommodation. Big variety of good Russian food and deserts! Full bar and great drinks specials. The goulash and lamb shashlik very top-shelf. Will definitely be back for more.."}
{"text":"I was going to try this restaurant when it was the Tverskaya on West Flamingo.  Then that place closed and I lost them for a while.  This has been a bookmark for quite sometime.  After a play at UNLV, I went here for an early dinner to try their Russian fare.  There were two customers when I arrived and when they left, I was the sole diner.  I had looked over the menu at home so I had some idea of what I'd order.  I got a small bowl of borsch to start and the katleti with chicken for the main course.  I finished the meal with a piece of Napoleon cake.  The server, Ludmila, brought my iced tea as I looked at the menu.  When she brought the borsch, she asked if I wanted bread and I answered just one piece.  She brought me a single roll which was just perfect.  The borsch is made with beet root and there were cubes of potato and small carrots in the soup.  It was quite hot and it tasted very good.  Katleti comes either in beef or chicken.  I got chicken.  It's ground chicken formed into a cutlet shape and fried.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and the meat was very juicy.  With the dish, there were two small scoops of lukewarm mashed potatoes and some sliced cucumber and tomato.  I was disappointed when I ordered dessert because some reviews say the honey cake is a must get.  They didn't have that.  I don't know if it's gone although it's still on the menu.  I'd like to go back and try something different.  It was a nice change from my regular fare."}
{"text":"Wow! What a pleasant surprise. We went to this restaurant because my mom had a coupon. It was awesome. The pickled appetizer was sweet and delicious. The cabbage rolls were better than my grandmother's. We almost got a second order. Our entries, stroganoff and goulash were so meaty and hearty, we were able to share between 3 people. Then of course, dessert. Napoleon cake. Decadent. We loved everything. The atmosphere isn't anything special, but the wait staff was exceptional. We will be going here again....with or without a coupon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out since I moved to Las Vegas about a year ago. I finally talked my partner into checking it out. The food was divine from the appetizers down to the dessert! Definitely check it out. My partner is Polish and he kept raving about how authentic and delicious the food tasted. Try their house infused vodka while you're there, too."}
{"text":"Tasty food, polite and solicitous service. The ambience is a little subdued, but works well with the theme of the place."}
{"text":"Called the restaurant twice to confirm that order will be delivered to MY DOOR at a hotel. Russian speaking gentleman confirmed it and I was waiting for the order for 60 minutes. Then a driver calls and tells me he cannot come. Then the driver's boss calls me and tells me they cannot come upstairs, since there is no parking. Really? Why do I order delivery? So it's DELIVERED, not PICKED UP. What a waste of time..."}
{"text":"Really tasty, no matter what you choose! Mellow atmosphere which makes you feel far removed from regular life outside and dip in Russo-nostalgia (we especially enjoyed the photo-wall and I'm not even Russian), in the best sense of the word.  Others have commented about the most traditional entrees, but here's for the less sung stars on the menu. Blintchiki that melt in your mouth; boyarskoe blyudo of rich deli meats; great home-style potatoes that make an equally good side dish to trout (flaky and buttery), gulyash or shashlik... Excellent honey cake too!   All in all if I lived here, I'd be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"The borscht was fantastic.  The caviar was to die for.  I told the waitress that I once had caviar on sushi and she kindly educated me that that doesn't count.  She was right!  I have only had Russian cuisine a few times and this will inspire me to keep at it."}
{"text":"We started with the vareniki which are worth the trip standing alone. The Borsht was not something I enjoyed but I do note others loved it. The Ceasare's salad was great but could have used more dressing. The lamb was terrible. The salmon was excellent. I would try the"}
{"text":"A positive introduction to Russian food for me.  Stefany V. invited folks to try this relatively unknown dining establishment in a very nondescript plaza on Tropicana and Spencer, and a few of us managed to find time to join her on a Friday night. Luckily for us newbies, she knows a guy with a nice sense of humor and a knowledge of Russian foods. He talked about how Russian cuisine strongly favors the use of mushrooms, potatoes, and dill. I would later learn that he was correct.  I was happy with all of the appetizers that we shared. The herring ($5.95) was delicate and balanced, and it was served cold with onion, dill, a sliced hard-boiled egg, and boiled-yet-not-bland potatoes. The cold beef tongue ($5.95) was tender but a bit boring, even with the horseradish. Our Russian was definitely impressed though. The \"Stolichniy\" ($6.95) salad was apparently misnamed, not that I would have known or even know still what the correct name is. Regardless, it was a tasty chicken potato salad, topped of course with dill. The Julien ($7.95) contained deliciously soft mushrooms baked in a not-too-rich sour cream and cheese sauce. The Golubtsy ($6.95) was probably my favorite, with delicious and moist ground beef and pork stuffed into soft cabbage rolls, which were topped with sour cream.  My entree of choice was lamb shashlik ($14.95), a variation on kabob. As with seemingly all of the other entrees, it was served with a slaw and with two scoops of mashed potatoes topped with, you guessed it, dill. Unlike the others, it also was accompanied by a sauce that very much resembled a tomato salsa. I did enjoy the meat's flavor, and the salsa grew on me as the meal progressed. The potato was solid as well and the slaw a welcome textural complement. My one issue was that it seemed a bit dry as a result of how they cooked it, which is partially my fault for not asking about meat temperature, but also a service issue in that they didn't ask if I wanted it cooked to the default medium-well.  While I wasn't impressed with my entree (and neither were those who ordered Chicken Kiev and Beef Stroganoff, which hopefully they'll elaborate on), I'll strongly consider returning because of the strength of the smaller plates and because I haven't tried their soups. Who knows, maybe better bites might be found in something traditionally associated with other cultures, such as goulash, schnitzel, or even pizza."}
{"text":"This past Friday night was Yelp night at Cafe Mayakovsky as five of us Yelpers came together for Stefany V's first UYE.  The evening was due to begin at 7:00 and so I arrived early as is my normal course of action.  I was one of two who arrived too early and we were seated right away in a rather quiet restaurant.  There were maybe only two other parties there at the time.  Soon we were joined by Stefany and the rest.  With her was Boris who is from where these treats originate so he was a big help in explaning the menu.  Based on his descriptions we decided on several appetizers to order and share.    We got beef tongue with horse radish, cold herring with potatoes and boiled egg topped with onion and dill, cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and topped with a sour cream sauce, a sort of potato and chicken salad and a mushroom and cheese dish.  Everything was brought out one at a time which lended plenty of time to tasting each individually without feeling too rushed.  I started with the herring.  I can say quite honestly this was my least favorite app but only for the simple fact that I don't care for fish.  But I did try it and found it to be salty and fishy.  It was about what I expected.  The potato and egg on the side were fine.  On to the tongue, I've had tongue once or twice before but only in small bites.  This was a whole slice and I did not know fully what to expect.  It turned out to be delicious.  It tastes very much like pot roast just minus the gravy.  If I was a fan of horse radish I would have used some of that on the tongue. I stuck with plain.  Next I tried the salad.  It was alright but nothing special.  Just potato salad with some chicken.  What I was most excited about might have been my favorite dish of the evening.  The cabbage rolls.  I had never tried Russian style and the sour cream sauce was a welcome difference to the usual tomato based sauce I am used to.  I love sour cream.  The cabbage itself was ultra tender and the meat moist and tender.  Sometimes the meat inside a cabbage roll can get dry and firm.  Not the case here.  Finally I tried the mushroom dish.  We got two little stainless steel measuring cup looking bowls filled with this sour cream and cheese sauce with mushroom bits.  I spooned a little onto my plate and enjoyed the creamy mushroomy goodness.  A close second to the cabbage rolls in my book.  Did I mention I love sour cream.  After we finished our shared appetizers we were on to ordering our entrees.  I ordered chicken Kiev.  Two at our table ordered lamb shashlik.  Stefany and Boris ordered stroganoff.  I saw some sort of ravioli dumpling dish too.  That looked good whatever it was.  I didn't hear them order.  When our food arrived, it all looked great.  The reality told a different story.  I think we were all less than impressed.  My Kiev was dry and over cooked.  The chicken was difficult to cut even with a knife.  And there was no gush of melted butter like I know Kiev to have.  Infact, I could hardly tell there was ever any butter in there at all.  If there had been then maybe the chicken would have been more moist.  The mashed potatoes on the side were flavorful but dense.  The cole slaw on the side was bland.  I was told the lamb shashlik had good flavor but was over cooked.  And that the stroganoff was lacking seasoning.  The first that that was said is that it needed salt.  A swing and a miss on entrees tonight.  With my meal I wanted to try a Russian beer.  I ordered a Baltica 9 which is classified as a dark lager.  It was hardly dark.  Slightly darker than a Budweiser I would estimate.  The alcohol content was consideralbly higher though.  I think 8% in this 25 oz. bottle.  The higher alcohol content gave the beer a slightly sweet taste.  Overall not a bad beer.  I would have liked it better colder.  Ales are OK on the warmer side but I like my lagers chilled.  I'm glad I got to try Cafe Mayakovsky this one time.  Even if I wasn't highly impressed.  Company was awesome.  Appetizers were good.  And now I have a story to tell.  But the story ends here I'm afraid.  I have no immediate plans to return to Cafe Mayakovsky."}
{"text":"Nice place ,delicious food ,very authentic taste to each dish.Wonderful I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try real Russian food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very cute & homey. Me & my bf came here for lunch and I was very excited to try authentic Russian cuisine.    We ordered an array of appetizers including the Vareniki, Golubtshy and Pirozki - all very tasty and flavorful.  I highly recommend the herring dish which was a delicious surprise; the combination of flavors and textures is just outstanding. The herring is super soft and just melts in your mouth.   I had the beef stroganoff as my entree, the gravy sauce is very savory and the side Russian salad is 100% fresh! All the breads and dumplings are made in-house and you can really taste the freshness. We finished things off with a Napoleon cake & honey cake which were amazing. Would definitely come back here for dinner & to check out their nighttime parties & shows.   Thank you to Tigrin and Batila (I know I'm spelling your names wrong & I'm so sorry!!!) Everything was delicious and you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I get a hankering for Russian cuisine. Las Vegas doesn't have a wide selection, so I was pretty stoked to try this place. My friend and I walked in on a Sunday night and had the entire restaurant to ourselves. I ordered the solianka soup and enjoyed every last slurp. 10/10 would eat again. Maybe I'll even try the beef tongue."}
{"text":"Best birthday I've had since 2012. The food was fantabulous and I will be a returning customer on non birthday days, We had Stroganoff, Borsh, another soup which was really hearty/beefy.   My dinner roll birthday cake was amazing. The waitress, Elizaveta was outstanding and really made sure everything was perfect.   I can't really express how thankful I am of this experience. Birthdays have a history of me to be terrible and this was the best one I've had in 6 years. Thank you Elizaveta and Team Cafe Mayakovsky!"}
{"text":"Muy buen lugar la atencion es excelente y el menu es diferente a lo que estamos acostumbrados aqui en las vegas platos tipicos europeos lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Bad Service, waitress freaked out when I asked to split the check. PS. She wouldn't take my Groupon because I checked in with Yelp and got a free drink."}
{"text":"I've been here only once, but I'll definitely be back.  The chicken Kiev is to die for, and the appetizers we had were amazing.  The kitchen clearly knows what they're doing, and having live music was certainly unexpected.  Phenomenal dinner experience, especially for the price."}
{"text":"(Note: I am Eastern European, born and raised there.)  My mom was visiting me for Christmas and we decided to find a Russian joint to indulge in some motherland food.  (Pause) If you don't know how real si??e kaok? or siljodka v shube tastes as well as pelmeni and borsh, you might like it, but it's absolutely DISGUSTING. Just to elaborate more: borsh was over cooked ( it's supposed to have red beet color, not orange ) siljodka v shube all together was a disaster ( over soaked, no specific taste and poorly layered ) pelmeni were the most eatable thing there. ( I can however get 100x better ones at the Eastern Market on Windmill, for 1/4 of the price ) 60$ tab and I wouldn't even pay 6$ for that.  My mom ended up cooking the same stuff at home.. THE REAL STUFF, properly executed and prepared.  BUT, like I said if you don't know better you probably would find \"exotic Russian dishes\" some-what bearable.  Thank you, no thank you, I'll pass."}
{"text":"I love Russian food like my life depends on it. I'm not from the area, but frequent Las Vegas. Don't let the strip mall deter you - this place is worth it. There were two of us and we went in around 1130am. It was definitely a Russian atmosphere decked out for the holidays with European music playing. The lights were down. They had a full bar and a lot of seating. We were told we could pick where to sit so we got a booth.  I forget our waitresses name, but she was wonderful. I got coffee and ordered pelemeni for an appetizer. So freaking good! We shared a little bowl of it. I got beef katleti and my boyfriend got chicken Kiev. The katleti were not dry at all and they were seasoned nicely. They came with mashed potatoes (equally delicious) and a side of veggies. I almost ate my plate..that's how delicious it was!  For dessert we split a piece of Napoleon cake. Flaky and sweet. Just perfect...I recommend this dessert. The food and service were both great!"}
{"text":"This place has high quality Russian food. The food was delicious and a new \"must visit\" restaurant when in Vegas. I had borscht, pelmeni, a rack of lamb with a flavorful Russian Lager. I highly recommend visiting this restaurant if you want delicious Russian food. The ambiance is nice and traditional; very clean. This is a great restaurant to have a nice conversation with a date or friends."}
{"text":"Came here because of a very special Groupon offer.  The menu is nice and offers a variety for all tastes.  The portions are generous and the prices excellent.  Recommend the soups: the borsch and solyanka were tasty and well-seasoned.  The goulash was tender and the shashlik (lamb) well done also.  Great chance to try a Georgian wine, the semi-sweet red worked really well with the main dish. Need to see more on the menu!  The decor is nice, deep colors and photographic mural are very original. Enjoyed the ambiance music, sounded Russian or at least Slavic. Would like to see more people there however. Very likely to return.  Ample parking in the plaza in the evening, just ignore banquet hall restrictions..."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to this restaurant and after reading all these great reviews about this place we decided on it from Groupon. The waiter was great! The food was excellent, and we will be coming back again! The Russian food was authentic and we loved every bit of it! I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to try something new!"}
{"text":"Excellent - Very friendly for a first time Russian eater. It's not all Caviar, vodka, cabbage and meat.  Had the Blinchiki, Pelmeni, Vareniki, Borsch, Shnitzel, honey cake and of course infused vodka.  All cooked and presented very well, would love to go back and try more!  The only downside was the vodka selection, which was minimal, although they did have some nice infused vodkas.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love love looove this place!!! The owner and all employees are so nice and curteous. They have a full bar now, atmosphere is great and cozy. And don't even get me started about food!!!! I am eastern european and grew up eating only russian food. Everytime I eat at this restaurant, I feel like my mother with my both grandmothers are in the kitchen - cooking!! Amazing! Am so happy there is such a place in Las Vegas that warms my heart and makes my tummy happy!!! :-))"}
{"text":"I am no stranger to Russian food, having lived a stone's throw from Little Odessa, the area of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn that's home to world class Russian restaurants and nightclubs.  I've been to these places many times, attended parties thrown by Russian friends, and even an over-the-top birthday party for a one-year-old, complete with kid in tuxedo and 9-piece orchestra.  Those Russians all dress to the nines, and know how to do it up right.  I've also had a fabulous couple of meals at a small, non-descript Russian restaurant in L.A., Robert's, where no one got dressed up and there was no entertainment other than the fabulous food.  Cafe Mayakovsky, which has been on my bookmark list forever, finally became a reality when we were on that side of town after dropping off the kids at the airport.  It's located in an eerily dilapidated strip mall and it's not a large place, but 90% was occupied by one of those huge Russian parties.    It's a fun place to observe.  The music was a combination of a talented singer and canned music when she was on break.  I loved the music.  Unfortunately, it was ear-shattering.  I swear, the world has gone deaf because of the constant noise exposure and no one can hear anything anymore.  The ladies were all dressed up and the dancing was endless.    But the food should be the star, and in my book the dining experience wasn't so stellar.  First, I ordered a glass of sparkling wine from the wine list, where it was listed by the glass.  Our waiter, who was inexplicably a Russian-speaking Korean, said they only had it by the bottle.  The only other white by the glass was chardonnay, which I don't like.  To their credit, they let me have the glass of wine.  We started with Perozhok, with cabbage.  There was only one bun and it was okay, but nothing special.  I was surprised that there was only one of them; I guess for the price I shouldn't have expected more, but the menu should have said it was \"per piece.\"  We shared an order of Vareniki with potatoes and onion.  It looked better than it tasted, not bad, but just ordinary.  And it was the same with our main courses:  katleti with chicken, my husband's choice, was bland, and my beef stroganoff was not only bland and gloppy, but was served with rice, instead of the noodles I'd expected.  I started this review by giving it 3 stars, but after re-reading what I wrote, I realized that it would have been worth three if that meant \"Okay,\" instead of \"A-Okay.\" That \"A\" made a big difference.  I definitely have experienced better."}
{"text":"I will make this my stop on every Vegas vacation. Wish they had all you can eat Borscht! Phenomenal food."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my daughter, craving Russian food for dinner. The place was mostly empty (telltale sign?) so we were seated almost immediately. We had herring fur coat, blinchiki with red caviar, borscht, pelmeni, and Napoleon for dessert. Both of us have been violently sick since 3 am this morning with food poisoning. I don't know exactly which dish should be blamed (my daughter thinks it was the borscht that tasted funny and she didn't finish it...), regardless I discourage anyone from trying this place. I would consider reporting this incident to the food health department."}
{"text":"We were bored and out of food so I found this place here on yelp. I love polish and Hungarian food so I figured why not try Russian? The place was almost empty, but in it's defense - it was fairly early on a Monday night. They play cool Russian music that we enjoyed anyway. The man in charge assured us that it is much more fun on Saturdays when they have live bands and dancing. He was very helpful and friendly explaining the menu and making suggestions for us. He reminded me to check in for my free shot of vodka and even gave my caveman boyfriend without a yelp account a free one too! The food was fantastic. Started out with a rich bowl of borsch. Caveman hates beets and even thought it was good. The vareniki were what I came for and they did not disappoint. They were delicious and just like homemade polish pierogis. They were out of chicken kiev so I got the Cornish game hen instead. It was perfectly seasoned and had the crispiest skin ever. Caveman got a grilled lamb kebab and it was also very good. Wish I had saved room for dessert, but there's always next time...."}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish. The salad was so fresh and the aroma lingering. The borscht was just perfect...felt like home to me although Iam Russian.   Only in Vegas for 2 more days. I know I'll be returning before going home to Delaware."}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually not that easy to spot. Unless you are looking for it, I dont think I would have come. The decor is just ok. I can tell they tried to put a fresh and much modern look to it, but there are some items that still look outdated. For our appetizer we ordered the Goluptsy. If you have never had this dish, think about a pork enchilada. The difference is that the outside is even softer. The rolls are made of cabbage but you can't even taste or see. It's a small plate but tasty. We ordered the pork schnitzel which was just ok. I felt it really needed the sauce that it usually comes with. We also ordered the Beef Stroganoff, the meat and the sauce were good, but again nothing crazy. I think I'm still curious to try some of their appetizers."}
{"text":"\"What is Russian food?\"    That is how our conversation began when we were trying to decide where to eat tonight.  I wasn't really sure.  I took two semesters of Russian in college, but beyond some pretty vague ideas of what was Borscht or Kasha I didn't even really know what to say.  We decided to at least drop by and check out the place.  The first thing I will say is to not be put off by the exterior.  The neighborhood seems a bit run down but once you walk through the front door you are transported to a world 50 years ago.  Wooden floors, half booths, and several tables for two in the dining area surrounded a small stage where they have live performances on the weekends.  The bar area is classy as well but none of it is pretentious.  We were greeted by our host.  I forgot to get his name and I am kicking myself for it.  He provided the best restaurant experience I've ever had (Previously Old School Pizza also here in Las Vegas).  I even hesitate to call him a host or a waiter.  Almost a professional dining assistant.  The advice we got on appetizers, drinks, and the meal was what one would expect at the type of restaurant people like me don't get in to.  So finally to the food.  We ordered a round of Baltika 3 and 7 for drinks and we each had the borscht, even the guy at our table that is a self-proclaimed beet hater decided to try it.  If it had been socially acceptable we would have licked our bowls clean.  I attempted to make borscht once from an internet recipe and it tasted like potatoes, beets, cabbage, beef and dill all in a bowl together.  What this gentlemen brought out was something that took on it's own nature.  I could find the buttery sweetness of the beets if I really concentrated on it and the beef flavor was there too but really the flavors all balanced together so that none of them stuck out over the other.  I haven't tasted anything like it before.  After the soup we had the red caviar and vareniki with potatoes and onions.  I've never had caviar before so I can't compare it to anything but I certainly enjoyed it.  Briny fishy flavor pods that burst in your mouth on top of crepes and butter.  I may have developed a new expensive habit.  The vareniki was also wonderful.  Almost like pirogi.  He recommended the lamb shashlik for me.  I love lamb and this reinforced my love of the meat.  Nicely marinaded with a good strong lamb flavor that wasn't overdone.  I'm not even sure what the sauce was that was served on the side but it complemented the meal wonderfully.  The other guys at the table ordered the stroganoff and the chicken tabaka.  The both said that their meals were wonderful as well.  We finished the dinner off with a turkish coffee and encouragement to return on the weekend for the live music.  If I get a vote I'll be going back to get some of that stroganoff!  So what is Russian food?  Russian food is the southern home cooking of a hearty people.  It's the food that gets you through a strong winter and can stand up to a bottle of Vodka.  It's food that takes the absolute basic ingredients and combines them to create flavors you have probably never tasted before.  If you are in Vegas and you don't try this restaurant at least once you are doing yourself a disservice.  You'll spend more at a chain restaurant than you will here and it will not be the memorable experience that this definitely will be.  I can not recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"This was an amazing and a very authentic Russian experience. Compliments to the Chef. Service was superb! Live music ads a very nice touch to the ambiance! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It is a little bit hard to find but definitely worth the trip. The interior is nice and relaxing. The space is large so you are not squeezed by another table and even when it`s crowd you still can hear your party.   Food - we always order soup - borsch and solyanka are very good. Solyanka is a little bit pricy but it worth it. Soup lapsha - chicken noodle was nothing spectacular, but still good.  Appetizers - we ordered pelmeni with sour cream. They were meaty and good. My husband got Golubtsy and they have a lot of meat too, both of them were very tasty.  As a main dish we had Kiev and shashik. I don`t like potato so I got Lamb shashlik with rice. It was very tender and yes, well cooked. I like my meat to be well done so I guess if you are a big fan of raw meat you have to ask them to make it according to your taste.  I have a sweet tooth so I always go for desert - Napoleon is one of my favorite. Honey cake and Praga cake I didn`t like, but Napoleon was the best for me. My daughter like their mors - it`s like lingberry juice. And we like Velvet beer- kind of amber - not too dark and not too strong.  Last but not least - the owner of the place is a very interesting person to talk to. I have to admit though that when he is not around waitresses become less caring (("}
{"text":"The salad is very very fire.  I think it is called a Jerusalem salad.  But so good.  The salmon is tasty to tickle your taste buds.  They had a DJ which played rock music.  No Russian music.  Salad is worth going back for"}
{"text":"It was a Friday and like that one song \"Everybody's working for the weekend\" I was ready to find somewhere to wind down. I had looked for a Russian restaurant before and remember reading about Cafe Mayakovsky. I decided to finally go check it out and I was so glad I did.   There was plenty of parking as another Yelper mentioned this strip mall was where the Liberace Museum used to be. The restaurant is now next to an adult day care and other mixed businesses. As I walked in, there was a young lady signing live on stage! She had a really good voice and it was like a Russian pop song. How Fun! My waiter was a young gentleman who was very knowledgeable in the menu and was very professional. He told me they started to hsve live music on Friday, Saturday and Sunday as it is usually busier on the weekends.  Though it seemed a little empty when I walked in, the place got busy and people were coming in for dinner and drinks really quick.   The waiter recommended the Chicken Kieve, so I went with that for my main entree. I also got a shot of Stolichnaya and a glass of champagne. I also got the pickled vegetable plate for my cold appetizer and the Vareniki stuffed with a potatoes filling for my hot appetizer. I really liked the pickled mushrooms and the pickled cabbage. It was almost like a slaw, but without the mayo. The brightness of the pickled vegtsbke cut through the savory Vareniki. I really liked both appetizers. For the entree, the Chicken Kiev came out piping hot and smelled delicious. It came with a side of mashed potatoes garnished with some fresh chopped parsley. The chicken had a good crunchy crust and the chicken was tasty. The potatoes were good too and I continued to enjoy my meal with the pickled veggies. The waiter continued to check on me and made sure I was enjoying my food. So nice! The singer when not signing would play other Russian -(I would say like Top 40 songs?) which would add to the atmosphere. For dessert, I opted for the Turkish coffee, which the waiter explained is like a stronger coffee and there is a boiling process so the grounds are at the bottom if the cup. Went with a slice of honey cake as well. Turkish coffee was strong, but not bitter. Honey Cake was good and went well with the coffee. All in all, I am so happy I came in and tried this place out. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was fun with the music, but not too loud so you can still enjoy your dinner and the food was good. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes and if you haven't had Rusian food before this a great spot to start. They are happy to answer any questions and are so nice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like trying different cuisines and it is refreshing to find something other than Asian or Mexican here in Las Vegas. We had dinner here on Christmas Eve and the service was outstanding. Three in our party had the beef stroganoff and I had the chicken kiev. All were delicious. As an appetizer we had the Julien and blinchiki. The blinchiki was very light which was a nice compliment to the Julien which was very rich. Prices were extremely reasonable and portions were European style. They seemed to focus on quality over quantity. Service is on the slow side so this is the type of place you come to experience and a meal and relax."}
{"text":"This place is in an old run down strip mall property and it's an end cap unit which is a plus for it. I ordered their beef stroganoff and Russian salad. The Russian salad was a small order lacking in ingredients for its price. The beef stroganoff was delicious, but the mashed potatoes was very dry and bland in taste. I gave this place 4 stars due to the exceptional service provided to my table."}
{"text":"The food was great! Had Borsch, cabbage rolls, stroganoff and chicken Kiev. The owner talked to us since my wife and I never had Russian food before. He was very nice and made recommendations. We came her because of a coupon and we will be coming back.  Also, we tried the honey cake for dessert. It was amazing. If you're looking for something new this is a nice place to try. The owner said they put out groupons so be on the look out."}
{"text":"We found this place because of a groupon and so glad we did. The food was excellent. We shared the mushroom blinchiki, the perozki with beef, and the lamb shashlik. All were great. We only wished we'd tried the blinchiki with beef and the perozki with potatoes instead. The texture and flavors seemed like they would have been a better combination that way.   There was a singer and dancing. Very lively and happy ambience. This is definitely not a tourist spot. Locals only and all were enjoying the authentic food and atmosphere.   We'll definitely be doing this again!"}
{"text":"I got there yesterday with my friend to have a dinner and everything was good. I love Russian food so much!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest not only is the food amazing but the service is the best I have had in Las Vegas. When you walk in you are a friend not a patron. I can't get enough of this place I have eaten in and carried out. My family and friends love this place and every time we are thinking about going out either for an early dinner or a girls date this is the spot. Each dish is prepared fresh if you are looking for a quick in and out Russian should not be your first choice . Dining here is as much about talking and drinking as it is eating. Even when I go alone the staff is so welcoming and inviting if you don't take a friend to talk to, you will make one before your visit is over."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to eat here with a group on a Saturday afternoon. Although the service was a little slow, (one employee taking care of everything including bartending) the place definitely deserves a great rating. Food was delicious, including the appetizers, main courses, and deserts. My favorite part was the house infused vodka! Absolutely delicious. Give the place a try so it thrives in this restaurant filled city."}
{"text":"My Russian friend introduced us to the world of Russian food with this restaurant. We were a group of  5 and started off in a true (well, almost) Russian way with rounds of infused vodka shots. We tried 3 flavors - cranberry, blackberry and buckhorn. I liked cranberry best. We also had a pitcher of Russian tradition drink called Mors - a must have. Appetizers: Russian salad was very fresh. Not too much dressing but tasted great. Stolichniy salad was good too. Must have apps are Blinchiki - these are melting in your mouth crepes. I loved ones with mushrooms. Ones with Cheese were great, were slightly sweeter. I was happy with my veg choices: Golubtsy, which was baked mushroom and cheese dish. Vareniki potatoes, dumplings filled with  potatoes and sauté onions on top. Side of sauté vegetables and potatoes made a good pairing.  My friends had meat entrees like stroganoff, chicken Kiev, katleti chicken and they were happy with their choices. Our server was pleasant and attentive. The owner also visited our table 2-3 times to make recommendations.  Ambiance was casual. There was a group on a side playing chess. There was a small stage on the side, suggesting the place would be much more lively with live music on the weekends. Overall, a great evening with great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday night around 9pm, the place was empty.  Never tried Russian food before, so everything we ordered was completely new to me. For appetizers we ordered the beef tongue and the ravioli. The beef tongue was THE bomb. It comes with a side of horseradish which surprisingly went really well with the tongue. Never would think to combine tongue with horseradish, but hey it works and we devoured that in secs. The tongue was served room temperature was very tender and thinly sliced, not cold at all, which is awesome. This was my favorite dish of the night.   Next was the ravioli with a dollop of sour cream on top. That's the first I've seen that, who puts sour cream on ravioli? Well it was delicious. Ravioli was plump, the meat filling is savory and juicy, and the sour cream just makes everything creamy and rich. It's definitely the best ravioli I've ever had. Who knew ravioli could taste this good?  For our entrees, we ordered the beef stroganoff and grilled meat kabobs. The beef stroganoff was a thick, savory gravy sauce packed with a ton of beef and mushrooms. It was served with a side of mashed potatoes. It was yummy too lol. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it which was a shame.   For dessert, we shared the napoleon cake. This was a big surprise, it was soft, moist, creamy and not super sweet at all. In fact,  it reminds me of something you can get from a French Asian bakery. I love the layers of cream, cake, and pastry.   We also wanted to try out the two Russian non alcholic drinks. I loved the wild berry one, it was so freaking good! It was like a juice that was sweet, fruity, and tart. It sort of reminded me of acai, but better! The other Russian drink, it was carbonated, and had a very distinct taste. Almost medicinal haha, didn't like it all that much.  Overall, I was super impressed. I would definitely come back here again. If you want to try something different, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Russian food!  Love to try new things and the food here is pretty good.   1.  The strip mall- located in the former Liberace Museum place, this mall is dilapidated and almost a deserted blighted area.  Of course it has plenty of parking, but it does nothing for the overall experience and ambiance.   2.  The restaurant-  I have only had Russian food in Moscow and when I first went in the late 80's, there was a certain lack of service and attention to detail. Of course things have changed dramatically, however Cafe Mayakovsky has a certain focus on getting things done vs creating a great experience.   3.  Service-  overall good and friendly.   4.  The party- they were having a huge party setting up while we were here so the whole dining area was a mess. Tables were piled with stuff and most tables were positioned for the party. Our reservation had a table off to the side, we felt completely disjointed based on how everyone was more focused on the party set up.   5.  The food-    We started to order a bottle of wine but then when we decided on the Herring appetizer, we all know vodka and herring mix well. So we got a bottle of Russian Standard Vodka!  Great stuff for sure and recommended by our waiter.   The appetizers of herring, pickled platter, blinchiki and Vareniki were great.  The blinchiki was a crepe filled with ground beef and we enjoyed this very much.  Toasted and fried on outside, juicy and tender on inside.   The Vareniki is a dumpling and ours was filled with potatoes. Loved it and would order this again.   For main courses our table had  Borsch soup!  Not bad, had better. We had a Chicken Kiev,  wow was it huge. Beef stroganoff, a full platter and a Rack of lamb which was a special- a great choice.  All of this was  just right and we finished everything. Thoroughly enjoyed it.   Dessert- we shared a Praga cake, chocolate and perfect. We also had the honey cake.  Both were wonderful and absolutely a great find.  Turkish coffee was outstanding. Not too bitter and not too muddy. I enjoyed it.   Very good food, friendly service. Why the three star,  a really odd ambiance, location and party set up that leaves you a feeling of either being rushed or not fitting in.  This greatly affected an otherwise excellent 4 star place.   Will try this again in future. To see if the ambiance is different."}
{"text":"Looking for something new? Check out this intimate spot. The food is high quality and high in flavor.  You must try the MORS (Wild Berries drink), pelmeni, vareniki, and schnitzel. That's enough to fill you up, but I would recommend going with a group and tasting everything.  I would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome - had the beef tongue appetizer and stroganoff. Both were perfect. Wife had mushroom crepes - and I have to admit they paired well with the stroganoff. They had live music (Saturday night) but it was lost in the food."}
{"text":"I had eaten at this place when they were in the old location over on West Flamingo. But they have changed names and relocated to the old Liberace Museum plaza, specifically the southeast corner. This was part of the property that was once the Carluccio's Italian restaurant.  The only issue I had with my visit was that I arrived at around 11:30AM and the door was locked and not looking too lively (they are supposed to be open at 11). Apparently they do not do a lot of business in the morning hours and did not find it necessary to be opened that early; I am not sure exactly why this was. But the bus boy/waiter showed up outside the door and told us that they would be opening; we were inside the restaurant minutes later. Had he not showed up so quickly I probably would have been gone before the official opening. But again, this was the ONLY problem I had with the visit.  The dining room is a little on the dark side, with the walls decorated with assorted Russian art and posters,, and a large landscape-style photo of Russian streets and the like. It is a very intimate looking locale, but never comes off as the kind of \"high class\" that will alienate average joes. There is a definite sense of ambience here, in the best of ways. A TV in the bar area can be seen from throughout the restaurant, and there is foreign (presumably Russian) music playing over the speakers. The place definitely has atmosphere.  Before long my mother and I were waited on; I ordered the Chicken Kiev and she ordered the Beef Stroganoff. We were given bread with butter while we waited, which was a nice touch.  When the food arrived, it absolutely did not disappoint. The Chicken Kiev had a solid outer layer of breading packed with flavor, and the garlic butter inside only added to the experience. I tried mom's Beef Stroganoff. And I tried it again. And again. And again. It had a very distinct flavor that is difficult to describe, but unique and delicious. The entrees were also served with mashed potatoes, which were very good as well. I only briefly perused the rest of the menu, but will absolutely return to try some of the other Russian cuisine offered.  Curiously no one else ever came in the restaurant the whole time we were there; they must make all of their money on dinner service. I do not see why it was empty; this food was to die for.  Cafe Mayakovsky is a great place to eat, and the location is easy to find. I look forward to my next visit. Even if you have never had Russian food before, I have no doubt you will be able to find something on the menu that will suit your tastes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best russian restaurant in Vegas. Extremely clean place and food was amazing!! If you are russian or love russian food there's no better place. Also the pricing is very reasonable. Not over priced like the strip."}
{"text":"Following the reviews I dragged some of my colleagues attending a Vegas conference to Cafe Mayakovsky for some Russian food figuring we all better learn to love it and soon :) The place was empty on a Saturday night and when we walked in a lonely singer belted our Russian Pop songs. The cheesiness of this place was actually really endearing and quaint. Soon we got to the appetizer round: boyarski platter, vareniki, pirozhki, herring - all very very good. Some of my less adventurous colleagues balked at the tongue but it was perfectly done and tasted wonderful with some fresh horseradish. The borscht was yummy - just like grandma used to make. The entrees were humbly done, meat and potatoes but all tasty and prepared with care. My only disappointment was the lack of flavored / infused vodkas that typically accompany Russian cuisine so we had to resort to just plain vodka.  Overall a neat departure from typical overpriced strip chains or semi-celebrity owned hack kitchens. Finding a family owned gem that cares about good food in friendly welcoming atmosphere is rare these days so I'm looking forward to coming back in the summer with family for some dumplings and stroganoff!!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! The best borsh ever!!!! Vareniki. Good food! Very friendly stuff) I recommended)  I like that in LA you can eat Europe food."}
{"text":"Three major complaints to make this place only a 3 star review.  1) There was MSG in the food. I think they used powdered soup base which is basically flavored MSG. It was in at least two of the dishes, the soup and the meat patties. They could have used the stuff in more dishes because soup base is versatile and will enhance the flavor of almost anything.  We started to suffer from thirst, swollen hands and feet, and drowsiness after about half an hour after leaving the restaurant. If you're sensitive to MSG, you'll want avoid this place or ask to make sure MSG or soup base wasn't used in any dish you're considering.  2) The prices on the menu didn't seem to be too high, but the portions were on the small side. You could easily spend a $100 for three and still not be totally full.  3) They played EDM and dance music the whole time we were there and some of the lyrics were totally inappropriate for a dining experience. We couldn't help being bothered by  the thumping and crude lyrics while we tried to enjoy our meal.  Any cook who uses MSG can't be taken seriously as a chef. It's a lazy way of cooking and we avoid any place that uses the toxic chemical. Anybody who said the food here is good, well, they're right. That's because it's loaded with MSG and they didn't realize it or have this junk a regular basis.   On a Friday night, there were only three tables including ours in this good sized restaurant. It's no wonder why."}
{"text":"I just ordered my first Russian meal and I was so impressed on how everything tasted. I will be back !!!!  Janice Fisher and Family"}
{"text":"So glad to see the other 5 star reviews, because this place deserves it. Unfortunately, it is stuck back in an outdated, dark strip mall and hard to find, but worth the adventure.  The food is excellent.  Service is very efficient and pleasant.  The place is spotless and pretty.  Everything is made from scratch and really delicious.  I wish more people knew about it, because it was very quiet when we were there.  It's also very reasonable and I can't wait to go back when next in Vegas."}
{"text":"More people need to venture to this place. The staff is so nice and we had an amazing time!!! The only reason we found this place was for resturant.com"}
{"text":"The decor is a little strange but the food is great. My boyfriend had the beef stroganoff and I had the schnitzel. I'd never had schnitzel before but wow, it was amazing! We will definitely be going back here. We also got some pierogies (or vareniki, not sure what the difference is) and they were delicious as well."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the restaurant listening to the music and the food was amazing!  I am definitely going back.   Thank you for the great food and experience.  If you haven't been there, you have to try it!"}
{"text":"My husband has wanted to have me check out some Russian food. He lived in Russia for several years and felt like enjoying a taste of his past. After checking out the menu he decided on sticking to appetizers since they were more authentic than most of the main dishes.  Tried tongue which was decent. Tender and good with horseraddish.  I loved the red caviar. The Pelmeni was also a hit. The meat inside had great flavor. The Golubtsy didn't have as much flavor. The Borsch was probably my favorite. So rich and good spices. Pirozki was also good but not made how my husband remembers. Honey cake was OK but I only had a few bites because we had a ton of food. The Russian beer was tasty and so was the Brandy with dessert.  Over all about 50% of the food was something I would get again. The atmosphere was pleasant. The server was excellent. Price was decent with the Groupon. Several Russians were eating there so that should count for something."}
{"text":"Saw a Groupon and wanted to try something different.  I am glad that we did.  Loved everything about it...atmosphere, service, and price.  We would come back even without a Groupon.  ;)"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. This place is great! Food was excellent and the restaurant is very modern and clean. If you're looking for something different, go Russian! The Beef Stroganoff is really good!"}
{"text":"I experienced my first taste of Russian food AND experienced my first Russian wedding here at Cafe Mayakovsky. My husband and I arrived with two friends for dinner and walked into a legit Russian wedding on a Saturday night. There was a dance floor, an emcee, and yup, you guessed it, all the Russian hits playing to celebrate the Russian newlyweds. Now depending on the person, this could be either awkward or extremely entertaining. I leaned towards the latter.  After perusing the menu, I noticed that there weren't any vegetarian entrees available. No matter, I went with two hot appetizers.  CABBAGE PEROZKI ($1.50) A soft warmed roll with bits of cabbage stuffed inside. I wouldn't get this again, but it was worth a shot. 3/5 VARENIKI ($5.95): A dumpling stuffed with potatoes and topped with sauteed onions and sour cream. Delicious and as good an entree as any! 5/5    Husband got the Chicken Kiev ($13.95) and loved it! Buttered chicken stuffed into some kind of roll and comes with all the fixings on the side (potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes).   Everyone loved being an audience member of the wedding and loved the food! Russian food is a yes for us.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #71"}
{"text":"Wine is much improved. Live DJ and volcalist are excellent in both Russian and English ."}
{"text":"I can't think of a way to give enough of a glowing review.  I've been twice.  The first time was heavenly.  The second was only lesser because I knew what to expect.  I will go here every time I'm in vegas.  Try the pelmeni and blackcurrant infused vodka.  Your mouth will thank you."}
{"text":"Cafe Mayakovsky.  What more can be said that other Yelp reviewers have not?  Well, let me try!  It was a warm, gentle evening as I reclined in my favorite sofa while sipping on a fine single malt scotch from a gold laden goblet while taking wisps from my ivory tusk pipe.  I felt a sudden longing, nay... a subtle desire creeping up from deep inside me of which at first I could not define.  It was not long before I was able to deduce that this yearning was indeed my need for sustenance.    I thought to myself (self)... what shall it be tonight?  The same old rustic TV dinner eviscerated of all it's nutrients by the nuke machine?  Bland delivery pizza or stale Chinese?  NO!!!  Tonight we try something new!  So there it was, I embarked on my journey through Yelp to find a 4 1/2-5 star gem that delivered, was unique and something that I had not yet tried.  Here I found the several previous reviews for Cafe Mayakovsky and decided to courageously give it a try.  My order consisted of the Chicken Kiev, mashed potatoes and the honey cake for dessert.   What can I possibly say about the nourishment I received this night that the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin had not already said better.  \"My whole life has been pledged to this meeting with you...\"  Truer words have never been spoken.  Although the food tasted of a bit extra salt due to the tears of joy and pleasure streaming down my face as I enjoyed every last delicious bite... the Chicken Kiev was cooked to perfection, while the mashed potatoes seemed to be made with only that special kind of love that you'd get from an Italian immigrant mother or a rescue pet.  The famous Honey Cake that I'd read so much about was only possible to be eaten while humming a tune from the well-known Russian opera Pan Voyevoda by Nikalai Rimsky-Korsakov.  Which was doubly odd since I had never heard of or even seen that opera.  So the final and most important question.  Would I recommend Cafe Mayakovsky?  I think the late great Vladimir Lenin said it best when he said \"Crime is a product of social excess\".  For those reading this humble review, it would truly be a crime to not eat at this amazing establishment."}
{"text":"Great find! This has been on my list to try for a while. Four of us went. The food is really quite wonderful. We had borscht (it is served hot--and excellent), golubtshy (cabbage stuffed with ground meats and spices--very pleasing), and vareniki--a sort of open dumpling with caramelized onion and meats. We also ordered blintzes which were off the chart delicious. For a zesty probiotic drink I recommend the kvas, a fermented beverage that is evidently a Russian staple for maintaining good health. Although the food is unfamiliar it has a feeling of comfort food. The service is friendly and attentive. Easy access and loads of parking on the southwest corner of Eastern at Tropicana. We will definitely be going back to work our way through the menu. Some good vodkas too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming to this place. Food is always amazing. Will definitely be going all the time for my favorite Russian Salad."}
{"text":"**Excellent for people who never tried Russian food before**  Have you ever tried a new type of cuisine and thought it was so disgusting that you never want to try it again? For those who never tried Russian food before, I strongly recommended this place. The food was decently priced, this place is authentic Russian restaurant in Vegas, and the owner is this awesome Russian guy! He was very accommodating and sat with us and talked for a while. We came on Russia's Independent Day, so we got free Vodka.   I absolutely loved the menu! Everything we tried was delicious.... Borsh - Sour....a very unique but pleasant flavor. I personally don't like beets, but how they utilize it in this soup, works for me. Beef Stroganoff - YUM! It reminds of gravy for some reason - thick, heavy, and savory. It is heavy comfort food all the way.  Shnitzel - YES! Fried pork, it is delicious and crispy. Many would look at it and assume it was fried fish. It is a must try. Shashlik Lamb - Typical lamb, it was on the dryer side. It tasted good, but if you already tried it elsewhere, then don't try it here. Honey Cake - I have always been a fan of the European Honey Cake since there's an amazing bakery in Hayward that sells these. This one is decent though. If you haven't tried it, try it!  Strongly recommended for authentic food!"}
{"text":"this place was dead when we went, but I can't see why! My parents and my boyfriend and I loved our dishes when we came! I grabbed the beet soup, which was unlike anything I expected, in a great way! We ordered blinchki appetizers, potatoe and mushroom kind, and I had to grab more^_^ so I did muahahaha:) check it out, it's different from your usual,but not at all disappointing"}
{"text":"Really good food. Try all the piroshki and desserts. I'm comings back again for more."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a russian restaurant before.  I had their potato dumplings we call them perogies, they were home made and so much better than anything I have attempted to make or purchased.  Next course was borscht again scratch made and delicious.  The marinated steak was yummy,  I could not identify the seasoning used and I liked that a new taste for the taste buds.  Last and my favorite was the honey cake, again made from scratch full of flavor and not super sweet.  You must get the Turkish coffee also!  This is right across the street from the pinball hall of fame, what more could a girl want video games and great food."}
{"text":"Our family enjoyed the great food  and excellent service. Authentic Russian Solyanka, great barbecued rack of lamb and other dishes. As a bonus there was a fabulous magic show."}
{"text":"My son's pick to take my parents for lunch. First time. You need to order the lamb Shashlik or the rack of lamb...amazing! Don't forget to try their non alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vareniki [Mashed Potatoes and Onion] it was kind of flavorless, next time ill try the cottage cheese stuffed. The Red Caviar was soooo good and only$10.95!!!! The stolichniy Salad was supposed to have chicken in it. Its just potatao salad with hard boiled eggs, not to good... The Napoleon Cake was REALLY good as well. The cream is amazing! Ill definality try this place again. Thanks grubhub!!"}
{"text":"I am the first time here because of a special event: The food is traditional Russian and looks and tastes like prepared by mamuschka at home. We tried Russian dumplings and Russian salad. The location is cosy, but rather simple."}
{"text":"Plan a party!  Cafe Mayakovsky is always a treat.  Vitali, the owner, is hospitable and a great host.  For a Russian party, there no better place in town.  All of the food that I have had was very tasty.  Restaurants in Russia are different than here.  Most of them have music and dancing and dinner is a leisurely affair where friends and family gather for good food, good drinks,  good music and dancing.  Cafe Mayakosky tries to recreate and capture this authenticity.  Make reservations, grab a bunch of your friends and go and enjoy an evening with Russian atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both enjoyed this place. The food was really good. We got the Red Caviar & Crepes, Potato Vareniki (dumplings), Stolichniy (chicken salad), and Beef Stroganoff. Their house infused vodka is really good too. The staff was really nice and spent a while explaining everything to us."}
{"text":"A nice quiet place.  Food is tasty.  Atmosphere seems dated in the '70's.  Menu is authentic Russian.  I thought the noodles were from a box, and not made from scratch, but they were \"OK\".  The sauces were the best part of the dishes, nice and flavorful."}
{"text":"Just realized I'm about to review yet another Russian restaurant, it's like I won't learn my lesson and keep going back for more spanking.    Every time I end up at a Russian restaurant it's because my giddy family gets a huge kick of hearing me speak Russian. Never fear, the wait staff is fluent in English, but I oblige all the same.    The food is...Russian. You've been to one Russian restaurant, you are an expert, choices vary not at all, frankly. We are not fancy. We whip up solid, hearty meals built around meat and potatoes and we come from a culture that valued salt as one would gold, so salt and pepper are it. We occasionally get saucy and throw in some dill or parsley, but we are plain and earnest in our cuisine. And heavy. Sour cream makes a fantastic base for every Russian sauce. Simple reason is we come from a place where it gets so cold in the winter, you are lucky to keep your face and toes from falling off. We need nutritious, calorie dense fare to keep us from freezing to death. We eat to keep alive, no joke. And we have to pickle everything because it all only grows two months a year.    And so Cafe Mayakovsky suffers from three things plaguing every Russian restaurant I've visited in Vegas- first, service can only be understood by Russians, meaning it is polite, but it's customary to give you time and space to socialize, so by a typical standard- slow, though really, they are just politely not rushing you. Second- food never varies much. Lastly- it's depressing beyond belief to be only party in a restaurant on a Saturday night.    Go and get a cross cultural experience, why not."}
{"text":"After all the amazing reviews I was expecting to be blown away.  The food was decent but it wasn't amazing.  The service was super slow and haphazard.  I think that three different people worked the table and it was more of afterthought than trying to provide service.   The appetizers were a bit small for the 8 dollar price tag.  The flavors were muted and it tasted like they were mass produced.  They just didn't appear to be fresh.   The chicken Kiev and the schnitzel were both very tasty.  The salmon was a bit over cooked and small for the $15 price.   The big disappointment was the sides.  The sides we ordered were the rice with vegetables and the homestyle potatoes.  They were $5 bucks each, way too small, and again the flavors were muted.    I was really hoping for a great dining experience but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"This Place is amazing! Vitali the Restaurant manager is super nice and very welcoming.We live in Los Angeles and every time we go to vegas with a bunch of friends we always come to this restaurant. The food and service top notch! They have a great young guy singing and a women too. we danced the night away! Thank you for your amazing customer service and friendliness. looking forward in coming here soon again!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was top notch. Glad that my brother took me here. Between the food, drinks, environment, and music, we had an amazing experience from start to finish. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Authentic Russian food, staff and clientele.  Lounge singer/DJ was great at involving the crowd. All the tables danced to Russian and Russian inspired favorites. Great food, full bar, it's like attending a Russian wedding and you're part of the family."}
{"text":"I like the food overall but I've had better chicken Kiev.  I loved my girl friend's lamb dish as well as the red caviar crepe.  I will return to try other entrees.  The borsch was delicious but a little oily.  Gr8 vodka selection and good nonalcoholic drinks.  Service was decent and ambiance was in progress."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Russian food. I started out with the Red Caviar Crepe is was delicious. My boyfriend had the Borsch soup and it was also delicious. My entree was the Shushlik  Lamb, it was tender and flavorful.  I would order that dish again. I drank an non-alcoholic drink called Kvas. I liked it, a taste similarity to Kombucha."}
{"text":"There should be more people in this place!  I've never had Russian cuisine before this night and honestly, it's just like American food.  I ate pork, potatoes, salad... Give it a shot (especially when you get a free shot with Yelp check-in).  Mayakovsky is located in a strip mall that I assumed was closed - there was no one else there.  Which is kinda sad because by the end of this experience, I found myself wanting to come back.  We stepped inside and were greeted & seated immediately with a bright, happy smile from a young Russian woman.  Looking around, we discovered we were the only guests for the entire visit (the final game of the Golden Knights Final may have had something to do with it).  It was a shame too because Thursday nights like this, they have entertainment from a magician, David.  While waiting for our food, he performed a free show for the two of us at our table, and seriously... he was fantastic - funny, skillful, and entertaining - he'll end up performing on the strip one day.  My friend and I shared meals.  The salad was the Stolichniy \"Olivie\" ($6.95) which is with chicken and veggies mixed with mayo - it reminded me of potato salad.  Next up we ate the Pelmeni ($7.95), which were meat dumplings, more like ravioli topped with sour cream - this was so delicious, by the time I remembered to take a photo, it was gone.  Then came the main course, Shashlik ($13.95 pork) which was served with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  There aren't a whole lot of Russian restaurants that I know of so it was nice to see one in the community and it deserves much more business.  So if you're ever in the area, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Ordered beef tongue...just how mom used to make. Excellent! Pork shashlik was delicious with baltica #7. Our server was funny knowledge and polite. Definitely going here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant because my daughter is taking an Anthropology class at UNLV and her teacher offered \"dining outside of your comfort zone\" as an assignment option.  Well, we had never dined out at a traditional Russian restaurant before so Café Mayakovsky was the perfect choice!  (Thank you, YELP!)  We arrived fairly early (5:45 pm) on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty (one other couple).  Our server (Ludmila) was extremely polite and provided excellent service.  When she found out about the assignment, she gave us a menu to take home for reference.  We tried many different traditional foods (Beef Stroganoff, Blintchiki, Vareniki, Borsch, Lamb Shashlik, Praga Cake) and drinks (Kvas and Mors) and we were not disappointed.  Unfortunately, they were out of their famous Napoleon cake.  The food was very tasty and the portion sizes were just right.  Probably the only two areas that could use a bit of improvement are the interior décor and the presentation of the food but neither of these would prevent me from returning."}
{"text":"Tucked away in where the old Liberace Museum once was is the best tasting Russian food in town. If you've never had Russian food you are missing out on some fabulous cuisine!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!! Since none of us had ever been to a Russian restaurant before we decided to order a bunch of different stuff and each try everything. Borsch, pelmini, golubtsky, shashlik, and finished it off with honey and Napoleon cakes. Amazing food. Even my 9 year old picky son loved it all."}
{"text":"I went there last week with my friends, and didn't have a good experience there.  First of all, and most important is kitchen, food wasn't fresh and didn't taste good. Atmosphere in the venue in general was very slow, and interior design is also reminding some old school Russian buffet. Adding 1 star for customer service, stuff was friendly and tried to be helpful."}
{"text":"So, the owner of this business sent me a nasty message which basically called me a liar. I will never eat at this establishment again.  I reviewed it honestly. I did not enjoy the food but, I really wanted to love the place. I stand by my original assessment of the quality of the food. The wait staff was sub-par as well, not helpful and almost rude. I did not appreciate the owner going out of his way to call me a liar. If the potatoes they served to my husband and me were not instant, they sure tasted like it. Instant potatoes have a particular texture and flavor, disgusting. The owner may want to change the preparation of their potatoes because, if  they make  fresh potatoes that taste, look, and have the texture of freeze dried, there is a problem. When instant potatoes sit on the plate, they often form little bubbles as they dry out. The potato dish we were served, did exactly that. The food was bland. The only flavor was in the dill they put in everything, and I mean everything. For a place to be this cute, to have this much potential, and serve bland, one note food is bad enough. When you partner that with the poor wait staff service and an owner who sends nasty messages to a patron, it's a sure fire way to ensure I will never be back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Spent a week exploring fancy restaurants on the Strip.  Then took my party to this place.  Well,  everyone agreed that it was the best dinner of the entire trip!  Well worth a drive.  Recommendation : come as a group and order a lot of different dishes.  Then everyone can taste everything."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant love the interior design remind me of Russia.delicious and fresh food.will be back again."}
{"text":"when in Vegas and looking for a Russian restaurant- this is the place. Nice staff and tasty food! Great vodka LOL - but i dont remember too much."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Best Russian food in town.Owner is always present and greets you and welcomes you. Beef stroganoff vareniki solyanka /borscht soup and beet and herring salad is all good. Once tried the meat platter including the tongue and wasn't a fan Good for locals and for good food .They have a bar Russian singers sometimes and a dance floor but in a dead area of town"}
{"text":"I regret that there isn't a Russian restaurant in Orlando where I live, so I always enjoy trying them in cities I'm visiting. This was one of the best I've dined at."}
{"text":"Was a slow night but we still gotto enjoy a magic show and the food was amazing. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service! Elena has waited on us each time and she is a joy! Great music! Great prices! We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of days ago with a friend. Great food, very friendly and accommodating stuff and amazing prices! I will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"It's SO Good! Is there a way to give 6 stars?   The owner and employees are amazing. Nice, courteous, quick and friendly.   The menu is a full Russian/Ukrainian menu. The type of food you would have at a fancy russian party and let me tell you, it is SO good. The way they make their Borscht is awesome. It's very authentic and very fresh. Also the Vareniki are delicious.   The atmosphere is very modern. The story of the picture of Moscow on the wall is pretty neat, come in and ask about it."}
{"text":"During my business trip to Vegas, my wife and I decided to have Russian food. The reception was very warm and the owner explained the whole menu to us. Pellemini were great and I ordered another plate. Everything what was served to is was well cooked. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I ordered their milk cake as well as their crepes. I'm french so I love a good crepe with real jam, not the bright red stuff that comes out of a can. These were amazing! I also got the milk cake, which I had never had, and loved it. Excellent delivery also; most drivers can never seem to find the correct apartment when deliveries are concerned! Will definitely order from again"}
