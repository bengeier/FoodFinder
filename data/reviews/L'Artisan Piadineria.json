{"text":"Stumbled upon this tiny place. Happy I did. Friendly people, tasty sandwiches. Great find."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place.  I found the menu a bit confusing.  There are a few meat options, each with a few options of cheese and add-ons.  You are looking at around $9.00 for a sandwich, which isn't cheap.  When you order, the guy rolls out a piece of dough and puts it on a griddle kind of like a crepe.  He then slices the meat or cheese and throws it on.  He then folds it and cuts it.  I got mortadella and arugula and a can of soda for $10.00. No tomato no condiments nothing.    It was very tasty!  I enjoyed it and appreciate the freshness.  I noticed they coffees are very well priced so for an espresso drink the value here looks great.  I don't know if I will go back soon because I found it a bit expensive for the ingredients.  But I will probably go back eventually."}
{"text":"Mon patron est allé manger la une fois avec une cliente alors j'ai pris la peine de l'essayer, comme tous les nouveaux restos dans le coin.   C'est une toute petite boutique de sandwich tout près du métro sherbrooke, au coin de st-denis. Dehors, une ardoise avec le spécial du jour. A l'intérieur, 2 comptoirs avec 3 bancs et la cuisine. Disons que le prendre pour emporter serait plus pratique, ce que j'ai fait. L'artisan Piadineria porte bien son nom puisque tout est fait maison, même le pain de style ' pita ' qu'Il fait sur demande. Tu choisis ensuite la viande de ton choix ( mortadelle, prosciutto, jambon, etc. ), du fromage (mozarella, bocconccini, etc.) et les légumes. Le prix est vraiment pas donné : 10,00$ environ pour un simple sandwich. J'ai pris prosciutto et pesto, sans fromage.  C'est super bon, mais ce n'est pas pour les petits porte-feuilles."}
{"text":"Je vais devoir y revenir! Petit café sympa avec une petite terrasse, j'y ai pris un cappuccino excellent... cependant les vedettes ici sont les \"piadina\" sandwich italien typique du nord de l'Italie (autour de Bologne)... ça avait l'air tout à fait appétissant mais il était trop tôt encore pour un sandwich!  :-(  Le service est rapide et courtois."}
{"text":"Get here early or else they tend to run out of ingredients. The most wonderful sandwiches, for lack of a better term. A choice for all tastes. Owner brought back this specialty from Naples and now has a second location. I usually take the 'Napoli'"}
{"text":"L'Artisan Piandineria is a well kept secret of Montreal. Walking by, you might never guess that inside is a small italian sandwich shop, started by a gentleman from Italy (Napoli region). The types of sandwiches are a unique style that I have never even heard about. In fact, I'm not even sure if there's an english translation for the word, Piandineria. But, if there is, I'm sure it's something along the lines of \"the most delicious sandwich-style meal possible\". The Prosciutto is sliced right on the spot and you can see all the fresh ingredients added in right in front of your eyes. The kind (and patient) owner/chef is always willing to help explain the concept of various items and speaks French, Italian, some German, and just a little bit of basic English. L'Artisan Piandineria will always have my vote as the top place to grab a unique, delicious lunch that will fill you up and feeling satisfied, without feeling over-stuffed."}
{"text":"Light healthy bread like a pita but 10X tastier heated on a plaque where the stracchino cheese melts and than you can add whatever cold cut Italian Style + salad and arucola... Try the porchetta for tastier or the prosciutto or turkey fast healthy and less than a Dixie ... Plus you get a history lesson from ENZO the laziest owner but can he cook up stories 5stars Not M5S"}
{"text":"I'm not sure we were in desperate need of a piadineria in this town (we can hardly get pizza right), but such is life in Montreal.  You can't always get what you want, but, if you try sometimes, you just might find you get a piadina--an artisanal one, at that.  What is a piadina?  Well, as you you might have gathered from some of the other reviews, it's a flatbread native to Naples and environs.  It's cooked up fresh on a griddle and is then used to envelop some savoury fillings (meat, cheese, greens, etc.)--kind of like an Italian wrap.    L'Artisan Piadineria has too many toppings, too many options, for my liking.  Scale back the menu and go with straight-up hits, would be my advice to the management.  My advice to you is to go with one of the daily specials.  Also, think juicy.  The flatbread itself is pretty dry.  It benefits from a choice of fillings that is going to be both a tasty and a juicy combination.  Unfortunately, many of the options on the menu aren't going to deliver on that promise, but, then again, many others will.  Our best bet was a super juicy sausage number that was called the Napoli, or the Neapolitan, or something like that.  We figured it had to be good, given the provenance of the piadina, and it was."}
{"text":"I love piadine... So I was really excited to try it. However, while I was waiting (third in line) I saw the only employee going from cash to handling the food without gloves. I actually saw her give someone their change than put lettuce in the piadina with her hands and than cut it. It's unacceptable. If that is how they are in front of customers, imagine when no one is looking. So unfortunately I didn't get to try them because I left."}
