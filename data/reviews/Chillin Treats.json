{"text":"These guys know what's good. Their service allows many customizable options for all their desserts, on top of plenty of tasty combos you can add on. For a late night snack delivery, they have a lot to offer ranging from brownies to grilled cheeses. I haven't been disappointed by Chillin Treats yet, and I don't expect to. I order from here about once a week, and am always satisfied with my delivery!"}
{"text":"This place is NOT a physical restaurant you can eat at. I made the mistake of trying to walk there to eat. Now I realize they run out of a coffee shop but do NOT allow walk ins. You have to order through a computer, they don't allow phone orders, it's more for questions. The number through Yelp said the number was invalid... But the number on GrubHub is accurate. You can order from the website or GrubHub but there's extra fees.

The options are basically grilled cheese, milkshakes, ice cream, brownies and cookies. And they're open until 3? Ok, I understand your target demographic... I can dig it. The food isn't like crazy special or anything and since they get busy delivery allows for the sandwich to be less cooked and ice cream a wee bit melted. Glad I tried it out, would order again."}
{"text":"They don't answer their phone and all online ordering sites (grub hub, seamless, etc.) say they do not accept online orders. If you Goto their website it prompts you to wait until they open at 10AM. I'm going with they don't exist?"}
{"text":"Like the other reviewer commented, this is a place you just order from and food gets delivered to you. I order from Grubhub. Not a place to visit. 

Decent food for late night cravings. Not amazing, 5 star quality stuff. Def something to order when hungry - pretty dense food and given in large quantities."}
