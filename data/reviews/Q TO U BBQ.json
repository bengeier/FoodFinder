{"text":"DELICIOUS!!  My husband and I tried B to U and loved it.  We got takeout. Ribs, brisket, pulled pork and the mac and cheese balls. We tried it all.  The ribs were fab.  We also loved dipping the mac and cheese balls into their BBQ sauce. The sauce is delicious - vinegary sweet. We recommend trying this new to Cave Creek restaurant."}
{"text":"Spectacular BBQ. Some of the best brisket I have ever had.  The pulled pork is flavorful with just the right amount of smoke. Homemade potato salad is just about perfect.  Q 2 U is a MUST!!!  If you don't like the food here, there is something wrong with your mouth"}
{"text":"My wife and really like this place. Great BBQ!! We lived in Texas for 20 years so sort of know a thing or two about good BBQ.... It is a bit expensive but it's worth it. The cheese macaroni balls are awesome.  Fries are great too. Just an easy and relaxing place to grab some great food."}
{"text":"have to say it's pretty mediocre bbq. the sauce is too sweet to me but I tend to like more vinegar based sauces. the fries were also sweet like they add sugar to seasoned salt.  I went and picked up food on a Thursday and the place was empty. it's expensive and not that great"}
{"text":"Pulled pork consistently good. Not a fan of their brisket. And quarter chicken was very dry. Potato salad not quite as my southern mom would do it. Cook the potatoes longer. Fried Mac & cheese balls are a must try!"}
{"text":"Called in a togo order for a combo platter which was excellent. Ribs, pulled pork, and brisket are outstanding.  The fried mac & cheese was off the charts...those should be on the dessert menu. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Was driving down Carefree Hwy and had no idea this place was here so we took a chance to try it. The place was empty during lunch hours this is never a good sign but we were committed to try it. We ordered the brisket by the pound with potato salad and the brisket sandwich with fries. Service was good place was clean and the brisket was perfect not dry and I could almost cut it with a fork. Sides were good too. I would eat there twice a week if it wasn't so pricy that was my only complaint it cost a little over $30 for lunch for two. Hopefully this place will stick around and lower their prices."}
{"text":"A solid 5!  Great BBQ in a clean and friendly environment. The ribs are some of the best I have ever tasted. If you like BBQ do yourself a favor and try this place. For me it is by far the best BBQ place in the valley."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I'm originally from Kansas City and grew up with the best of best BBQ. I have to say Q To BBQ is my favorite Arizona BBQ. The beef brisket sandwich is my favorite. A MUST have is the jalapeño cream corn, u won't be disappointed and it will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Why is it that it seems that every BBQ joint I visit claims to have been \"voted\" best?  By the owner's parents?  Children?  Pastor?  Pulled Pork, Beans, Potato Salad; all average,including the sauce."}
{"text":"The wife and I stumbled upon this place driving along Carefree Highway and stopped in.  An unassuming place, but some of the best Q I've had in the Phoenix area.  I work pretty close to Little Miss BBQ, so my bar is pretty high!

I thought the quality of the brisket was good, the pork ribs were tender and flavorful.  I really enjoyed the BBQ sauce too.  The sides, especially the jalapeno creamed corn and the wings I found quite good.

I hope they're working on a liquor license, only thing missing was a nice cold beer to go with the Q.  We'll be back!

I'm out!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ in Cave Creek.  Favorite meats are the ribs, followed closely by the pulled pork and then Brisket.  The jalapeno creamed corn was amazing too.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Great place with very friendly staff!! Great BBQ and even a decent burger! Our kids love the chicken tenders. The fries are great and the coleslaw is delicious! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. I'm from TX and my husband is a chef. This is the best bbq next to his I have had in the area. The ribs fell off the bone. Great smoke flavor in the chicken, brisket and pork. The jalapeno creamed corn was delicious! Loved the bbq sauce, too."}
{"text":"Good bbq, my wife loved the pickles and the bbq sauce was a nice mix of sweet and a little spicy."}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ junkie...without any reservations. I've traveled quite a bit and have had the privilege of trying some of America's greatest BBQ haunts. BUT....without any doubt, this is the best I've had. Wings, rubbed then smoked for hours then flash fried before serving...are you kidding me! Amazing. Pulled pork has incredible flavor with a great texture (no fatty bites), and the ribs are quite simply ridiculous. I've tried every side (amazing) but don't miss the creamed corn with jalapeños. Good luck defund desert...just get both, it's easier!

Go see Dave and Karyn. Two of the most welcoming people who truly love what they do. Did I mention they are Pit Masters...yep."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident. It's in a strip mall.  I had the BBQ pork sandwich. Tender and the sauce was good. Coleslaw and corn dish. My dinner companion had the combo. He had the brisket and ribs. He said one of the best rubs he has had."}
{"text":"Terrible experience with the ribs.  Picked up order to go and found the ribs very tough and under cooked. Called to complain and was told to throw in oven for awhile.  Are you kidding me?   Piss poor food and customer service. We will never be back!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great! I had pulled pork and beef brisket, both were awesome! The guy at the register - I think he was the owner - was really friendly and checked checked on us several times. Excited to have a delicious new spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices!  I had the Papa Jack, 1/2 pork, 1/2 brisket; wife had brisket, son had pulled pork sandwich. 

Their sauce & many sides are tasty & gluten free - good news for celiac sufferers like my wife. 

Meat was tender & juicy, sandwich was well presented - a full meal, just messy enough to be good BBQ but not a mess.  The Rosols EARNED the trophies & medals they have on display.  Our new family favorite BBQ place in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ at their Anthem location, and now they have added this location on Carefree Highway. Excellent BBQ, and a good selection of sides.

Looking forward to having you available closer to the Norterra area!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a good BBQ place. This place has the feel of a local pizza joint but several BBQ instead. The pulled pork is great and the fries even better. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for lunch (shop local!) and the place was pretty empty. It was expensive also, $28 for two sandwiches, two (disappointing) sides, and two drinks. It was very quiet and only the TV turned down low, dirty tables, everything on the table was sticky (sauces and ketchup). The meat was very good (brisket and pulled pork) and the sauce was very good. The buns were cold, the potato salad was obviously old, and the fries were covered in Lawry's seasoning salt. They have way too much competition to stay in business long with bad side dishes and sloppy tables. The menu was very hard to read, and the whole place just lacks any  personality. I hope they get better, at this time I have no intention of going back."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the poor service.  At least the kids behind the counter are friendly.  The owner or manager was downright rude.  My wife and I dined on a Friday night that wasn't too crowded.  Ordered ribs and BBQ potato skins with brisket.  It took 30 minutes for our food to come out.  Usually wouldn't say anything but three orders came out for diners who ordered after we did.  The manager at first denied it, but when my wife pointed out who they were, he blamed it on the potato skins taking longer.  That's probably information they need to tell you when you order.  He was very rude about it, too.

When our food finally did arrive, the ribs were cold and the potato skins had pulled pork instead of brisket like we ordered.  We sent them back and they complied, but another 8 minutes.

The ribs are just ok, nothing special.  The loaded potato skins were actually fantastic, but not sure worth the wait.  They also have pretty good bbq sauce.

Bottom line is we probably won't eat here again.  We'll drive the extra 10 minutes to Bryans in Cave Creek where the BBQ is far superior and service is consistent."}
{"text":"This BBQ melts in your mouth and the service was excellent. Shahil was so wonderful and patient as It you as our first time there today. We have found our BBQ spot now! You will love It!"}
{"text":"Best bbq pork nachos! Their bbq sauce is a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. 
Only complaint is they close at 6 on Sunday (dinner time) and closed on Monday. But good for the employees -which are always friendly.
Every time I say I will try something else on the menu, 
 I end up wanting the nachos. Try them!"}
{"text":"Excellent bbq and sides.  BBQ ribs, creamed corn both yummy.  Great coleslaw.  The sides are made for two to share.  No alcohol and you order at the counter and they bring to your table.  Pleasant, young man took our order.  Clean and welcoming.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight. We had the 2 meat platter with ribs and brisket. The meat was great. We got slaw and baked beans on the side. I liked both, but my wife thought the beans were way too sweet. We mixed a bit of jalapeños in and they were perfect. We also tried the pulled pork loaded potato skins. They were good too. Next time I would order everything with the sauce on the side instead of drizzled on top."}
{"text":"I'm really too disgusted even post anything against or for this business terrible very bad service at the front counter at the walk out. The guy practically chased me out she made a mistake with my order. You should use a Q-tip to clean his damn ears out"}
{"text":"We went to Q to U BBQ for the first time tonight. Wow, was it good! We had a full slab, that we split. Plenty for the two of us. Side of potato salad was okay. We'll try a different one next time. What a gem in the Cave Creek area!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the pros: I had a very different experience than a previous Yelper - great service. Very nice people who bring your food to you quickly and check on you. Also the pulled pork was super tender! And the taste was very good but not that smokey. My table was clean. 

The cons: everything is sweet- the BBQ sauce, the rub, the pickles, the potato salad, etc. if this is your thing, enjoy! It was too much for me. The woman who makes the potato salad (maybe an owner?) stopped by to let me know the pickles were house made. I mentioned how sweet they were and noted that I needed something tart to cut the richness of all the other sweet items on the plate. Her response was that that was their style and suggested I get the potato salad next time as it has less sugar. I asked why there was sugar in the potato salad, she said to balance out the acid. I asked what acid was in there and she said \"onions\"! (Onions are high alkaline not high acid.) She was insistent that you had to add sugar to potato salad to balance it out. Oh and it has relish in it too - so you know it has to also be super sweet. 

Either these people have not heard that we eat way too much sugar in our diets or they don't care. Maybe the mac-n-cheese doesn't have sugar, but it seems everything else they make does. 

This isn't my style of BBQ. Bryan's on Cave Creek Rd is better - not fantastic, but better."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! We've been fans since they were in their old location in Anthem. I crave the BBQ sauce and fries!  The pulled pork is actually 'clean' and not fatty like some places. I normally have to order extra because I pick out so much fat. NOT this place, it's great. Great family place! Love the owner, she is always so friendly and remembers who we are. She always makes a point to come out and say hello and welcome back. We happily drive the 30 mins here to have great BBQ."}
{"text":"2nd day open and we tried this cute little BBQ joint out.  We are picky with our BBQ which is why we didn't rate as 5 but it was a solid 4.5.  We eat at Little Miss BBQ so everyone has a high bar to match and they come really close.

App- Fried Mac N Cheese was great.  Nice crispy outside and good Mac inside.  Worth trying. 

Main- Loosen Your Belt Plate so you can try all the meats.  By order of preference/deliciousness was:
#1-#2 almost a tie was the Chicken and Ribs. Both were fantastic in flavor and tenderness. 
#3 behind only in a very small margin was the Pulled Pork. Flavor and tenderness on spot. 
#4 was the brisket.  It was good but not great. 

Our sides were baked beans and fries.  Beans had great flavor and fried had a BBQ dry rub sprinkled on them which made for a yummy taste.  Perfectly fried with crispy outside and soft inside.

Over all very happy and look forward to returning again and again.  Won't be disappointed when you come."}
{"text":"I ordered a pulled pork sandwich for takeout today. when I got home I was impressed by the immensity of the sandwich, but that paled in comparison to the taste - OMG!! My new favorate barbeque place to go! Deelish."}
{"text":"Ribs and Brisket are great! Fried Mac n Cheese was a real treat. I wish I lived closer but will be back when in the area"}
{"text":"Great place, great to have a new bbq place in the neighborhood. Food and service are both excellent. I would recommend for any other the lesser reviews to try it again sometomes it takes a little time for a new place to get the bugs worked out."}
{"text":"Pricing is ridiculous.  I ordered the brisket sandwich at the counter and paid... just like any other fast food restaurant.  I figured that for $11 I ought to be blown away.  And I was!!!  At the cost.

Bun was far bigger then the portion and it came with fries which were good.  And some sort of sweet pickle.  

The only things that would differentiate this place from a fast food restaurant are:

1.  They slide the iPad around when you are paying at the register so that you have the ability to now tip the person standing there taking your order.  It's then that you realize \"Shoot.  I'd better tip.  Because I suppose that I want the guy who is going to bring it out from the kitchen to know that I'm a stand up customer and not some cheapo.\"

2.  They do bring your order out to you.  Not that it's necessary or even a benefit in any way.  But they do this.

3.  The pricing is twice what any fast food place should charge for a brisket sandwich.

So it wound up being about $30 for my sandwich and my girlfriends brisket salad.  We were done in about 5 minutes just as anybody would at any other fast food restaurant and got on with our day.

We certainly weren't raving about our incredible meal and we surely won't be running back.

Those numbers are way out of line guys.  It's decent BBQ and I know you've won a few awards.  But that kind of markup us preposterous."}
{"text":"Ribs were tough,  brisket was full of fat , portions are small

Prices are outrageous for what you get,"}
{"text":"Excellent bbq, I smoke my own when I have time but this place blew me away. It's in a strip mall but the bbq is better  than any other bbq joint in cave creek and it's a better value than the other places. Pork ribs and smoked wings are beyond expections."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ and the Smoked wings appetizer was actually pretty good. 
The portion size would not make a hearty eater happy (even got the jumbo sand which) and its not like its cheaper than other BBQ places. 

Just a little thing.....  They had someone clearing tables which was nice, but when asked for a plate for us to make splitting easier, he forgot and continued to clear tables and converse with a family that he seemed to know while we waited until I just got up and went to get it myself. Again, just a little thing, but did not add to the experience."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place, especially with them being competitive smokers.  Went for lunch, and place was about half full and doing a nice take out business.  Decided to try the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches.  For sides had coleslaw and sweet potato fries (which costs an extra buck --a pet peeve of mine but not uncommon.).  Order at the counter, get the drinks and wait not too long for the food to be served.

Pros:  quality, tender meat with not too much fat or sauce and nice bun

Cons:  no flavor!  Really could not detect any smoke, seasoning, any flavor to the meat at all.  I am usually not one to add any sauce to BBQ, but I tried the sauce on the table, hot sauce, salt, anything to bring the meat to life to no avail.  The slaw was just so so, and the sweet potato fries were good, but when I asked about the ranch sauce that was advertised with the appetizer portion, was told that as a side it would be an extra 55 cents on top of the extra buck I paid for the fries.  Really?

Overall impression --a solid Meh.  There are much better BBQ places in the Creek (like Bryans) or North Phoenix (like the Thumb) to satisfy your BBQ cravings."}
{"text":"I tried them at taste of cave creek beat pulled pork slider ever ! And coleslaw was great too!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue ! I love the spicy cream corn as a side.  The pulled pork sandwiches are my go to. A great take out change on the dinner routine"}
