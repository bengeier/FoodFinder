{"text":"Something about microwaving each dish really bugs me.  Alex S. said it in 2008 and most of what he said rings true with me 2 years (and several visits) later.  The flavours can be pretty tasty if it's not one of the plates dripping in grease, and if you're really stuck for a vegetarian lunch in the area, you can take a chance on their daily lunch special.  Otherwise, for what it is, I do find it pretty overpriced.  Maybe eating-in is the key - the dining room is lovely for a decent place to catch-up with old friends over a weekday lunch.  But overall, I much prefer either of the two other restaurants serving asian mock meat on St-Denis (one at Sherbrooke and one right above Maryanne)."}
{"text":"I have to say that I had an excellent meal here last summer (2007), but since then Chuch has failed to impress... last meal was dry, tasted like ketchup, and tiny portions considering the price tag - at about $15 a meal I definitely want some substance.   This place seemed to fall under its weight - they have a fantastic concept but they fail to deliver on some crucial restauranting basics - the service totally stinks here, they are slow as anything, and the food in theory should be delicious, but when you actually get it, it's not what you had hoped for. They skimp on ingredients and everything looks pre-made and thrown onto a plate. If I wanted take-out I would have taken-out!!!!  Example - their Pad Thai - I've had better for $8 at Thai Express. And that's saying something.   This place just isn't worth the price - unless they open up their terrace and you get to chill out while throwing a few teas back (and they don't ignore you when you grab a seat), and go there for more than the food."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, nor do I particularly enjoy trying different meats.  I decided on one of the duck entrée, since I probably wouldn't try real duck any time soon.  I also ordered a fish cake appetizer and brown rice.  I enjoyed the fish cakes, which tasted like salmon cakes and were served with a cucumber salad.  The duck was spicy and tasted how I would expect duck to taste (or maybe as I remember as a child).  Service was excellent, even though I only spoke English in a French speaking city."}
{"text":"Chuch is one of the things I miss most about Montreal.   The mock meat is the best I've had in Canada. I highly recommend trying the peanut mock chicken and the red curry mock duck. They're absolutely to die for and the service tends to be reasonably quick and courteous.   I know it seems expensive (it is, a little) but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"A disappointment. While there are extensive vegan options that look, sound, and smell truly amazing, Chuch simply does not deliver the goods. The \"large\" (CAN 10$) was anything but--it is filling, but only because of the high quantity of oil. And that's just kind of disgusting.   Despite the fact that the food was decently flavored, I was incredibly underwhelmed with my experience here, especially after being told it was one of the best vegan spots in the city. That couldn't be further from the truth. I'd say it is, without a doubt, hugely overrated. Here's the deal: the food is all reheated in a microwave; it's expensive for the portion (and for being, well, microwaved); and while the flavors vary from average to quite good, the dishes are all dripping with grease. It tasted good initially, but it left me feeling kind of gross.   The more veggie places I tried in this wonderful city, the less I liked my meal at Chuch. The food is fine, at best, and  with all of the other phenomenal restaurants within walking distance--the vastly superior Le Faim du Monde is right next door--I can't think of a reason to eat here."}
{"text":"Chuchai et Chuch is the express version of their restaurant Chuchai.  The food here is mediocre to say the least. Pony up the money and just go to their regular restaurant instead (located right next door),  You food is a lot better there and cooked to order rather than heated up in a microwave.   Been here a couple of times, and although it's nice if you're on the go, it's just not worth it in terms of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Chuch has totally changed. This place got better; it went from not so much to pretty okay to even good. The decor is entirely different from about a year and a half or so ago; the chairs are comfortable and the ambiance is funky, original and ostensibly pretty Thai. The music is still wanting. Where once there seemed to be a value for dollar problem ... there is now a balanced and rectified pricing scheme in place that appropriately reflects the food that they serve. The food is the most important part in any case and that has drastically improved. After returning from Thailand about six months ago I went on a mad hunt for two things ... exotic fruit (some such as the rambutan or Nephelium lappaceum, the durian or Durio zibethinus, and my favourite, the Queen of Fruits, the sumptuous mangosteen or Garcinia mangostana) and also a beautiful vegetarian green curry. Chuch has a pretty good one of these that they serve with either sticky coconut rice or a healthful bowlful of wild rice. I also had a ginger, lemongrass and coconut soup that was warming to the core. It's pretty good and it'll have to do in this part of town. For the best of the best vis-à-vis a strictly vegetarian Thai green curry (as in no shrimp paste) go to Galanga Bistro Thaï in Outremont. Enjoy."}
