{"text":"Outstanding barbecue - brisket and pulled chicken were delicious. Anxious to try the ribs. Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming - definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We live in the area and had our sights on this place for a while - it's exciting to have a bbq joint in the neighbourhood. We had the opportunity to go here back in the late summer soon after they opened up. It was the wife's birthday and this place was a total downer. The sandwiches were cold, the meat felt like it was reheated.  The menu items were limited (where's the green options? The coleslaw was good, yes, but wasn't supposed to be the feature item). Overall the place was very average. We had high hopes for a bbq/smokehouse-like joint but this was very disappointing. I hate myself for giving a startup 2 stars but there's really nothing special here. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Finally came here today for lunch after wanting to come for awhile.  I live in the area and was intrigued when I first saw a new BBQ place, after Paul and Sandy's left the area about a year ago there's been a real lack of BBQ in Etobicoke.  

It's a very cute little restaurant, extremely clean and I love the rustic flair.  We both ordered pulled pork sandwiches and a side of fries.  My boyfriend got the mild sauce on his and I got the special \"Golden\" sauce, which is a unique mustard based sauce with a bit of a kick.  The sandwiches were a fluffy brioche bun piled high with meat...and OMG deliciousness.  The pulled pork had been cooked to perfection and was NOT dry.  You can always tell when places overcook their meat until it's dried out, and then drown it in sauce in an attempt to re-hydrate it and mask the dryness.  The pulled pork was tender and moist and not overpowered by the sauce.  The sandwiches came with a small side of coleslaw which was very tasty, very light and fresh tasting and not drowned in mayo or vinegar.  The side of fries was generous portion and served in a large metal bowl, and they were perfectly crispy.  We also ordered a side of baked beans which were super good.  We couldn't finish the baked beans and the fries so we had to take them to go.

Before we left we chatted with the owner for a bit (didn't get his name) and he's a really great guy.  You can tell he really cares about his business and cares if the customers enjoy his food.  He told us how he gets his meats from the Mennonites (which anyone who knows meat, knows they are the best to get meat from!). Whenever I encounter a great owner it really elevates the business to me and makes me appreciate it more.  I can't wait to come back soon and try the ribs.  Really suggest this place to anyone craving good, quality BBQ in Etobicoke and wants to support a great local business."}
{"text":"When we got there around 6.15 pm, beef brisket was almost sold out.  There was just enough to make a juicy tender brisket sandwich with sweet peppery horseradish & mustard sauce...delicious!  My husband got a portion of the ribs with their spicy sauce, it was not fall of the bone but enough to sink your teeth and still get tender meat with some texture.  Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, although it was a tad messy but fun!

Friendly atmosphere with great food.  Love the decor.  For sure we'll be back for more"}
{"text":"This place caught my eye compared to the other restaurants in the neighborhood, and I am a big fan of pulled pork...which is exactly what I ordered!
The sandwich was incredibly tasty. The meat, sauce, and bun were all perfect. Got a coleslaw on the side which was what I needed to balance the smoky sweetness from the sandwich. Tried the beans and fries as well which were ok, nothing special. Looking forward to coming back soon and trying everything else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Fantastic brisket with their house sauce and the pulled pork with the Golden sauce really hits the spot. If you're in the neighborhood atop by and have some of the best BBQ in Toronto. Kudos to these guys!"}
{"text":"This is BBQ done right. 

A small simple menu, sandwiches and ribs, with all the standard sides available, I stopped by here for a dinner and was quite satisfied, will definitely visit again if I'm in the neighborhood.

Ordered a brisket sandwich with the Mac and Cheese, and walked away full and happy.

The brisket was thinly sliced, nicely smoked and stacked high on a fresh soft bun, topped with carmalized onions. As well I chose the spicy Appalachia BBQ sauce with it. Was not too hot, but I understand for public consumption, you need to tread lightly with 'hot' sauce. The sandwich alone was enough to satisfy me, additionaly there was a small side of creamy purple slaw. Just right, not too sweet, and not soaked. 

The Mac and Cheese was delicious as well, cheesy baked goodness. Not a sauce poured over noodles like how my prior experience was in a different bbq joint.

Limited seating available here, two two seat tables, and a row of stools, so it seems it's more a take out than dine in place, fortunately I could take a table. And there was a steady stream of customers coming through the door, which is always a good sign. 

I look forward to visiting again and trying something different off the menu."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. For some reason a lot of people gave this place three and four stars. I guess I went at a bad time. The pull pork was dry, had to load on the BBQ sauce to make it taste better. The bake beans where severely under cooked. I spent Sixty dollars on a dinner that taste  twenty dollars. The best thing on the menu are the ribs. With so many BBQ places opening up this place needs to step up there game."}
{"text":"Came in to check out the new bbq place in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, there isn't too many places like these in Etobicoke. Had the smoked brisket sandwich to go. The beef was moist, tender and had lots of flavour. The servers were friendly and helpful. I'll be back to try the ribs next time I'm in."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! When we went in, we were the only customers although it soon filled up. I was there with a friend and we both ordered the ribs, myself the half portion and he got the full one. It was to die for!!! Really tasty and delicious meat. The owner was there and he was delightful, telling us about the short history of the place and the origin of the name (hint: Appalachia is mentioned in a lot of bar-b-q shows). I could barely finish my portion of the food and my friend, who could put away a lot, took the remainder of his ribs home, for dinner.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ribs are always terrific, fries delicious and crisp and the pulled pork I moist and loose. Brownie points for a non mayo coleslaw. Can't wait to try the lakeshore location."}
{"text":"We're so excited to have Appalachia Smokehouse and BBQ on the Queensway. We were lucky enough to get a sneak peek.  The owners are amazing people -- super friendly -- and invited us in to sample before the official opening. We had the smoked pulled pork with their hot bbq sauce -- it was soooo good. The sauce was amazing, and the bun was super fresh. You can tell everything was made right there. Very fresh and satisfying.

Great food, great customer service! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is what happens when someone who loves food and cooking opens a neighborhood eatery!

Dropped by the Lakeshore shop last night and had the most amazing brisket I can every remember.  Melt in your mouth, beefy deliciousness!  I had it with no bun, just with the caramelized onions and sauce.  SO SO good!  Had side of fries which were excellent.  I took home some sides and some ribs.  The coleslaw is the best I have ever had....simple but mostly purple cabbage and some carrots, this is super NUTRITIOUS more nutritious than 'greens' - these veggies are packed with more minerals and vitamins than almost any other veggies.  It was probably lower in calories as the dressing was not cream/mayo based.  The baked beans also have a lot of nutrition to them and are not soggy, they have a bit of texture to them as they are not CANNED.  All are homemade with a lot of trial and error to come up with the best recipe version.  Like you would make at home.  The ribs were very meaty but not super tender - likely as I ate them a day later.  Clearly everything here is well though out, highest quality, and tested.  The owner is very friendly.  I love people like this and their food!"}
{"text":"For several months I watched as the window sign saying Appalachia Smokehouse stood mocking me. Telling me smoked meaty goodness was coming to a neighbourhood near me, but for months nothing happened - nothing! I can only equate the many feelings I experienced to that of a dog eagerly waiting his masters return each day, only to be disappointed each time a car drives by and it's not the right one.

One day not too long ago, I noticed the door was open, AND lights were on, AND they were OPEN. Well let me tell you I literally made an excitement puddle right there on the floor (of my car... hey I'd had a lot of coffee that day ok!)

Then the worst thing happened, I went on a vacation! It would be 3 weeks plus before I could sample what I had been dreaming of for months... nay a year!

Then last week the stars aligned, the odds were in my favour, the dice came up, I hit black jack and following a lunch meeting canceling I popped in for a lunch bite! Joy.. rapture!!!

Looking over the menu by day it's basically the healthiest, cleanest pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket sandwiches you can get anywhere close by, and by night (after 5pm) you can specially order some of their smoked ribs to eat in or take away. PRO-TIP: They pre-sell these ribs and they run out fast, they'll have people come in for a sandwich at lunch and order their pick up for dinner at the end of the day... so call ahead to get you name down.

This day I went for the brisket as a combo. Note that I was a little miffed when all a combo came with was fries... no drink. I thought the essence of a combo was to include drink, side and main for a reasonable price. So be prepared to spend a little extra if you need some liquids!

Now back to the brisket! The sandwich comes standard on a toasted ciabatta bun piled high with thick cut grisly brisket topped with caramelized onions and a special sauce. Amazing As is! The brisket while not as flavourful as others I've had was perfectly cooked through and the perfect balance of meat to fat!

Definitely a damn fine sammy and one I'll be back for again soon!

Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of smoked meat and BBQ and all the accoutrements and Appalachia has it. There are three meats available here, brisket which is the breast, or lower chest of beef is marbled with fat so is tender and juicy, pulled pork, or pulled chicken. I tried the brisket on a bun with caramelized onions and it was very good. Their BBQ sauce had a nice smokey undertone and the meat was tender and fell apart easily. Love the aftertaste too! For sides I had the slow cooked baked beans which were great. Love the heartiness of them and they are a super healthful alternative to deep fried potatoes, which is another choice along with sweet potato fries. The sandwich is around $9 for the chicken and pork, and $12 for the brisket, and comes with a tiny container of red cole slaw which is delicious but just a sampler size. I recommend asking for the larger side for only $2 more is in more of a normal size container and could be shared by two people. They also offer sliders which could be a good way of sampling the pork and chicken to see which one to order next time. The brisket came with its own BBQ sauce, and there are two others which you can ask for as well.
The elephant in the room at Appalachia is the smoked ribs which are only available after 5pm so keep that in mind as it promises to be incredibly good and is $13 for a half rack and $25 for a full rack.
This restaurant is a welcome addition to the Asian and Italian influences around this neighbourhood near my work, so I now have another choice along the Queensway strip."}
{"text":"I am SO happy I finally ended up here, and that this place is so conveniently located on the Queensway, which means I can easily go back.

My first impression was high as I had requested a reservation as we were bringing in out of town guests, and the owner accommodated this request by politely offering to shift the time by half an hour. Not a problem, since we would be taking up one of the two 4 person tables so it was reasonable.

I was even more impressed when I was greeted by name by the owner himself & he cheerfully welcomed us into his restaurant.

We began with his last order of hush puppies, which were accompanied by a tangy sauce. They were delicious and well seasoned. I think the order came with 4 puppies and was priced at $4. We followed up with a new item which was fries with brisket and freshly grated cheese. The fries were well made, and the gravy accompanying the fries was delicious, akin to a nice, thick poutine gravy. I believe this was priced at $9, and it was a pretty hefty portion. We easily split it amongst four of us.

Next, the owner brought over a 'taster' of four ribs as we were deciding on what to get. Those four ribs sold us. They were so incredibly tender, that you could barely grip them to eat them. The owner advised that he keeps them in the smoker until they are served, and you could see the beautiful red smoke ring from that work. The house made sauce on them was also deliciously tangy yet sweet (but not overly sugary like basic bbq sauce).

I chose the pulled pork sandwich, which was served on a toasted brioche bun and came with  nice side of coleslaw and mac and cheese (around $12 for the combo). The mac and cheese was nice because you could tell the sauce was made in house, and it was a good sized side portion considering how much meat you get in the sandwich.

My dining friends had brisket, which they liked too. One of the best surprises with the brisket was in the housemade horseradish sauce, which the owner explained is cooked in house (as are all the sauces - none of them are served raw). It was surprisingly good, and a good accompaniment to the brisket. Honestly, I think he could sell this stuff and people would buy it all up because it was that interesting in terms of flavour.

We even went ahead and ordered a full rack of ribs ($25) which were devoured quickly, simply because they were that good. The last thing we needed was more meat, but we went for it! 

Honestly, the best part of our meal was our interaction with the owner. He kept asking for feedback and was so proud in describing his passion for smoking and the restaurants. He's been open at this location for about 3 years, and the Lake Shore Blvd location has been open for 1 year. It was just him and one staff member that night, but every time we ordered something, they hustled and it showed.

Frankly, I think it's easy to judge small businesses like this against larger shops. I find those places tend to lose their authenticity quickly and it comes down to being simply about a dollar. This owner is clearly running this shop and has a high level of investment in how the food is served. The pride at which he spoke of his craft is evident, so excuse the guy if he takes a break once or twice a week to be closed. This is hard work.

We are so lucky to have a place like this in Etobicoke. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had the brisket sandwich and it had a very nice horseradish sauce. The fries were great too."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!  This is one of those great little Toronto gems worth exploring! I wad in the mood for a non chain local restaurant and this was it. 
The beef brisket was just how it should be and the pulled chicken was even better! If you're in the area you have to stop in!"}
{"text":"Nice place tucked into a street front building in the wasteland along the Islington/Queensway area that used to or still houses massage joints, discount optical, and the Best Portuguese Chicken a couple of doors down.

Ordered half rack dry and half rack wet with coleslaw.  Tender fall off the bone ribs.  Dry rub could use just a wee bit more salt but you can taste the smokiness.  Mild wet are a nice slightly sweet tangy sauce.  The nice friendly guy came out from the kitchen and asked how we were doing and offered us some sauce for dipping so we tried the spicy sauce.  It was nice, a bit chunky, had a nice thickness to it and was tangy and a bit sweet and went well slathered into the dry ribs.  Coleslaw was a nice fresh crisp purple cabbage and carrot combo in a refreshing dressing.  Nice and light to go with the ribs.  When in the mood just go for it, seriously."}
{"text":"Went today around 145.
Ordered a brisket sandwich with their caramelized onions and special sauce( I believe mustard and horseradish ) bun fresh and soft, comes with a small side of coleslaw  (vinegar base).
Service  was prompt. The sandwich was a good portion glad I didn't order a side. Next time.
Small seating maybe 4 stools and 2 tables (2 top)
Interior was nice, they have been open since June and I have driven by many times and didn't notice saw review on Yelp. It on the north side of the Queensway about 4 storefronts east of Islington.
Bonus they say ribs aren't ava8able until 5pm but they were ready so took a 1/2 rack home for dinner. They have chicken and pork also so next time.
Fills my void when Paul and Sandy's closed. 
I'll go back for sure"}
{"text":"Cenando con mi familia.
Smoked pulled pork, Ribs.
Wow amazing. 
Definitivamente regresaremos. Muy recommendable.
Pequeño restaurante pero muy agradable.
Me encanto"}
{"text":"The brisket is AMAZING!

I've eaten at quite a few other bbq places that serve dry, thin layers of beef but this place is the complete opposite.

The brisket was plentiful; thick and tender slices. Normally the bread in any bbq sandwich is a simply a vehicle for the delicious meat but the buns served at this place complement the meat very well (and there slightly toasted which is always a plus!). Lastly, the portion size was also a great bargain for just $12.

I am more of a brisket fan but even the pulled pork and ribs (which I stole from other members of my party) were quite tasty.

Overall I would highly recommend this place; and that is without mentioning the great customer service!"}
{"text":"I miss Paul and Sandy's but this place will satisfy my brisket fix.  It's a very very small place that looks more geared for takeout business than sit down.  The brisket is incredibly tender and piled on a lightly toasted roll, covered in their Gold (mustard based) bbq sauce.  
      My son grabbed the pulled pork which he absolutely devoured.  He said that it wasn't as good as Paul and Sandy's but he did enjoy it.  The only criticism that he had was that he asked for their hotter bbq sauce on the sandwich, and it seemed to lack the kind of kick that he was looking for.
     The sandwiches both came with a side of purple, vinegar based coleslaw which happens to be my favourite.
    All in all, it's a place that does bbq right!  

Please note that the ribs are only available at certain times (early evening/mid afternoon)."}
{"text":"Ok food, definitely not the greatest. 

Came here around 7 on a Wednesday. It was a little busy from three rather large crowds (4-5 people each) so service was a bit slow and food took about 20 minutes to get. I don't blame the workers though, there was only 1 worker at first, and then someone came a bit later to help out. 

Ordered the beef brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, half rack of ribs and a side of coleslaw. Total was around $43 including taxes. The sandwiches are quite small - smaller than I expected when they're $9-12. A grown adult could easily eat 1.5 sandwiches. I also wasn't a big fan of them only offering the meat in sandwich form. I prefer beef brisket on its own. 

In terms of taste the food was alright, but I've had much better before. The pulled pork seemed pretty dry, maybe because there wasn't enough sauced. The beef brisket was actually probably the best. Coleslaw wasn't good and I could easily make a better one myself. Ribs were ok. 

I can't see myself coming back, but given the area, there aren't exactly that many better options. A place that's good enough if you want bbq food and don't feel like going far for it."}
{"text":"LAZY.
Left feeling this was NOT a good experience.
Arrived around 1, looking to try the ribs.  No ribs, we were told in about 4 hours.  You had SUN/MON off, still no ribs.  First impressions (dates/restaurants) mean a lot, this was a bad first impression, leading to no interest in return.
Owners jacket taking up one of only 4 seating chairs, the sign laying across the interior floor.  Horrible vibe.  If you've been to good/great bbq joints (usa/canada), they really put effort into the operation.  The overpriced brisket sandwich (12 bucks) was mediocre at best, chicken (smoked) sandwich the best part.  Mac n Cheese was a joke, 6 bucks for 40 cents of noodles and barely any cheese; shame.  It should be a toonie at best, no flavour.
How do you spell disappointing....."}
{"text":"Amazingly good, 'er NO, amazingly GREAT food!!! This is definitely a new hidden gem for those living at Loggia Condos, or other residents in the area. The best news is that the portions are generous, and the pulled pork or pulled chicken isn't drowning in sauce, in fact, you get to choose the amount that's right for you! And, make sure you get the Gold Sauce, it's unique and unbelievably great flavour. In the famous words of Arnold Schwarzenegger \"You will be back\" ...for sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Amazing prices, delicious BBQ and you will not leave hungry. 

The pulled pork sandwich was pilled high with steroid/hormone free meat and a sweet BBQ sauce on a soft brioche bun, accompanied with coleslaw on or off the sandwich. The french fries are perfectly crispy. But the low prices are the real selling factor here. 

The only poor thing about this restaurant is the location.. This place deserves a bigger and brighter spot. 

Can't wait to go back and try the ribs!!"}
{"text":"It really does boggle my mind when I eat a mediocre meal at a small restaurant. You would think if you're going to go to the trouble of opening a new joint in such a crowded marketplace, you'd make an effort to serve up top-notch, above-average food every single night.

The food we consumed during our trip felt lazy, uninspired, and completely phoned in. It was as if the chef figured, hey, it's a slow Wednesday night; why should I actually *try*?

We ordered two sandwiches to share: the Smoked Brisket (\"with caramelized onions and a horseradish brisket sauce\") and the Smoked Pulled Pork (\"coleslaw on sandwich or on the side\").

The Brisket was absolutely the worse of the two. It was dry, overcooked, and completely lacking in flavor, smoky or otherwise. It was the kind of meat you'd expect to get at a school cafeteria, quite frankly. The horseradish brisket sauce was pretty tasty, admittedly.

The Pulled Pork fared slightly better, only because it was a more enjoyable sandwich to consume. The pork itself had a slightly leftover taste to it, but that was at least drowned out by the very strong barbecue sauce it had been slathered in. Was there anything smoky about this sandwich, though? Absolutely not.

The accompanying coleslaw was overpowered by vinegar, so that went unfinished. I also ordered a side of the Slow Cooked Baked Beans, and as I remarked to my dining companion, these beans answer the question of what baked beans would taste like if they were served for dessert. The whole thing was just cloyingly sweet, to the point where they were almost inedible. These may just be the worst baked beans I've ever eaten.

I have to wonder if the food at Appalachia is always this bad, or if the chef was just having an off night. In any event, I'll never return."}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time- brisket sandwich, 1/2 rack ribs + baked beans.  Baked beans were ok- but then again, I'm not sure I'm a baked beans person. The flavour was good though.

OMG@ the brisket. Amazing. Melting, tender, not too fatty. so so good.

The ribs were good- my husband loved them. 

They owners were lovely- I'm happy to have them in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went from loving this place to not so much.  Went last night at 745 and got 2 brisket sandwiches, a regular side of beans, a regular side of fries, and an order of hush puppies. $40+ would not be so bad, except that changed their fresh hand cut fries to frozen fries...disappointing to say the least, but they also changed the once delicious beans with brisket in them to some kind of tomato bean sludge that is sweet and mostly flavorless.  To top it off they did not put the coleslaw that comes with each sandwich in the bag!The brisket sandwiches were still good as were the hush puppies.  The register person was a middle aged woman who did not seem to care too much about anything...which is sad because we have met the owner and he seemed to have a passion for what he does.  VERY disappointed and probably will not go back.  SAD."}
{"text":"Some of the best smoked brisket I have ever had. The coleslaw is also out of this world. The decor is really nice. The baked beans were a bit of a miss (too much molasses) and I would like to see something green on the menu, but overall really delicious- definitely an up and coming place!"}
{"text":"We Will Be Back!!
Fantastic BBQ joint on the Queensway.
The menu is tight and efficient.  No unnecessary extras.
We ordered pulled chicken sandwich, half rack of ribs, fries and coleslaw.  Everything was amazing.  We ordered the ribs with the spicy (bold) sauce, and the pulled chicken with a great  spicy mustard based sauce (I think they referred to it as Gold Sauce).  They let us try the sauces before we made or picks.  Coleslaw was made fresh, and the fries were really tasty.  
The staff were friendly and accommodating.  Great place!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Love the pork sliders, the perfect size and the buns are soft and warm. The Gold BBQ sauce is so good, but all are really great and not super sweet, very tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just came here to the first time, and I can't say enough about the place. I met Jerry (I think the owner) who was very kind, and nice to talk to. Menu is simple, but for my first time (had the pulled pork sand which) it was great! Loved the bun, the sauces I got were mild and gold mixed, which gave it a great taste. Great portion of pulled pork, and got me really full.  I couldn't finish the fries I got, so buyer beware hahah. Jerry gave a sample of chilli since we got on the topic of it and it's got a great, Hearty flavour! They use brisket that wasn't sold, so basically a brisket chilli, outstanding simply put. I recommend this place highly. Great atmosphere, clean and friendly! I can't see this place going anywhere, ever.


So just an update (July 8/16) I took a break from here because of how often I was going (once a week)... I haven't even finished my sandwich, pulled pork with gold sauce... And I'm pretty disappointed... The fries are good as always but, I dunno if the buns were changed or what. It's just a massive piece of bread I got, with a pretty disappointing portion of pulled pork, to what I used to get. Maybe it's a one off, but I dunno... Not happy on this one"}
{"text":"Had the pulled chicken with Gold bbq sauce. Very good.
 Very clean inside and nice decor. Smells amazing! 
Price is a little high but it was a nice portion."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. Sandwiches are large and reasonably priced. $14 for pulled pork and fries."}
{"text":"Went back for those thick, juicy ribs. They're still thick and juicy. But this time the BBQ sauce was tastier than the first time we went. We were asked if we wanted the mild or spicy sauce - I don't remember having a spicy option before. We chose the spicy version and it was more like \"medium\" but certainly more flavourful than what we had last time.

And they've also added a couple more sides - mac n cheese and hush puppies. 

We also tried their southern fried chicken sandwich - basically a piece of fried chicken breast with gravy in a bun. It wasn't very good.

Next time I go back, I think I'll stick to their ribs."}
