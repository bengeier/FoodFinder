{"text":"After hearing about how great this restaurant  was from a few of my friends, my girlfriend and I were looking forward to a really nice meal.  Unfortunately, the experience left a lot to be desired.

The drinks (martini and a beer) came out and were great, service was a bit slow, but it was a nice night and we didn't mind the wait to much.  We had the muscles and crab cake appetizers, the muscles were amazing, a huge portion and cooked perfectly.  The crab cake was small and not very flavorful, defiantly didn't seem like fresh crab, probably canned or frozen, I wouldn't get it again.

The problem was really with the entree.  I ordered the filet and my girlfriend ordered the duck.  The other couple with us ordered a filet and the duck as well.  The duck was good, not a large portion, but about what was expected.  Both of the filet's were ordered medium rare, and came out very overcooked.  I would say they were medium well, quite dry and no pink in the center.  We both let the waitress know and she took them back to the kitchen and said we would have new one out shortly.  A few minutes later, the chef came out with the steaks we had sent back, he had cut them open a few places and told us that they were done properly, and he wouldn't re-cook them any differently.  He set them down and walked away. 

We realized that he had switched the plates (I had my friends steak, he had mine), unfortunately we only realized after we had another bite, so I we just decided we would keep them.  We were both a bit shocked, it's pretty rare for me to send something back, but when I'm paying $20+ for a very small filet, I really expect it to be cooked properly.  Instead, we were both stuck with dry, over-cooked, and pretty flavor-less steaks.  I have NEVER seen anything sent back to the kitchen, only to have the cook refuse to fix the food.  We were never asked again how our food was, and the owner was going around visiting all the tables, but made it very clear to avoid us.

While this isn't the most expensive place in town, when I'm spending $50 per person for a meal, I expect thing to be at least cooked properly, and treated like the restaurant values my business.  This was not the case.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Visited Tartine Bistro recently with my wife due to the recommendation of a co worker who lives in Rocky River and raves about the place.  I must admit that the atmosphere is wonderful.  Warm and cozy.  I understand the patio is great during the summer as well.  My wife and I had a couple of nice cabs that the server suggested.  We both started with the frisee salad which was huge and delicious, one of the best salad I have had in a while.  Unfortunately, our entrees were not a memorable.  I had the duck tartine and my wife had the beef.  Both were incredible dry.  Since they are obviously the house specialty we were both disappointed.  Will definitely try the place again when on the west side but will search out something else for an entrée."}
{"text":"Went here once with my wife and parents and thought it was nice. Good service for the most part. I really like the ambiance. Menu looks good on paper. However I dined at Tartine with my wife last night and i was a little disappointed. The stuffed dates were good, not great. The goat cheese needs to be thinned out with a mild cheese like mascarpone or heavy cream. Goat cheese tastes gritty otherwise. The cheese plate for $9 (3 cheeses) was a nice size portion. The only reason for the three stars instead of four is because of my disappointment in my entree. I had he frisée salad. Frisée, when in season, should be more yellow and white-ish colored then dark green. The frisée was not good quality. I hate wilted greens. It was supposed to come with a poached egg, and it was fried. It was supposed to come with hollandaise sauce and there was none. There couldn't have been more then a teaspoon of a simple oil
and lemon vinaigrette on the salad. Very disappointed with the false description."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Quaint space with excellent wine list(and pretty decent house wine at great price) chefs mix flavors very creatively...great pizzas, appetizers and tartines(open face sandwich). Suprisingly affordable..you will come back again and again. This is the place we take out all our friends and out of towners."}
{"text":"I really love going to this place.First off, it meets my top three criteria for a pleasurable dining experience: clean, good service and good food. The inside is small with a bar running down one side and tables down the other. They also have a nice patio area.  Right now Rocky River has the whole street torn up which detracts from the ambiance but i'd say their outside seating area is very pleasant regardless of the construction around it.

Their menu is limited but everything I've had has been good. The onion soup and stuffed dates are both very decadent. If you like duck and figs, the duck tartine is a very tasty. Also they have this one cocktail called the Lemon Ginger Sour that I dream about. This place has an upscale bistro vibe but is still very comfortable; the waitstaff is friendly and attentive but has never been pushy or tried to rush us.

I've never had to wait for a table but I'm not sure if I ever went on a weekend so you might want to make a reservation, especially if your party is larger than 2."}
{"text":"My fiance and I really enjoyed eating here for dinner on a special night out.  She especially loved the cheese plate and french onion soup.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here, especially the warm hospitality from the owner who was there at dinner and welcomed us."}
{"text":"We are regulars at tartine. The food is consistently great. Never over the top, always nicely balanced. The frisée salad and duck tartine are my favorite. Always want to compliment the cook on superbly prepared food. Oh. And don't forget the flourless chocolate torte. Oh. And half price wine Tuesdays!! Great outside patio. Impress your east side friends by taking them here :)"}
{"text":"Very eclectic with wonderful wine choices. Cozy and very comfortable. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Looking forward to returning soon for one of there theme dinners!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good restaurants in Cleveland and I've eaten in many of them.  My wife and I feel like Tartine Bistro is our favorite restaurant in town.  We've tried many of the items on the menu and to be honest, I haven't had a dish I didn't think was terrific.  If I have any complaint, it's that the chairs in the main dining room are too small and very uncomfortable.  It's a small annoyance and one I'm willing to ignore for such a good meal."}
{"text":"A cold, windy late summer evening.  A dimly lit and sultry wine bar.  Red tin ceiling tiles.  Huge photographs of Paris.  What more could one ask for?

To start, the 2007 Vina Honda monastrell from Jumilla.  Dark purple, with layers of blueberry and spices.  For the 4 of us, we got everything to share.  The Roasted Date, Goat Cheese, Bacon, and Port Wine Syrup was an interesting take on the bacon-wrapped dates.  Here, roasting the dates intensified its flavor.  The goat cheese crumbles and cubes of bacon scattered throughout provided a textural and taste contrast to the sweet dates.  Next, a Crab Cake with Citrus Slaw and Mango Remoulade.  Good crab cake, very meaty without filler.  Then, one of the signature tartines, the Duck Confit with Brie and Fig/Shallot Jam.  This is how any open-faced sandwich should be.  Tender juicy meat, gooey cheese, sweet intense spread.  Lastly, we had a Pizza of Wild Mushrooms, Leek, and Black Truffle Oil.  Perfect woodiness, brightened up with splashes of the truffle oil.

Why 3 stars?  Tartine is a great neighborhood place.  It has a dim, sultry ambience befitting a good wine bar.  The staff are super friendly.  The food is tasty.  Excellent all around."}
{"text":"I spent a year and a half in Lyon and this is the closest I have found to authentic French cuisine.   Their tartines are amazing.   The roasted dates MELT in your mouth.   The frisee salad is authentic and the fried egg just completes the salad.   If you get ANYTHING though - try the cauliflower gratin.   Out of this world."}
{"text":"Amazing. Excellent choice for lunch. Baked Brie and crab cake appetizer. Perfect. Lamb stew over phylo pastry had just the right amount of burgandy. Steak A Poivre was a small portion, amazing taste and cooked as ordered. Outstanding choice for family, friends or customers. Great service was a serendipity."}
{"text":"Still loving Tartine. They are still changing the menu regularly. The mussels are extraordinary. I think we have a keeper."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen: For years, my wife and I had enjoyed this tucked away little gem of a bistro, with its great service and consistently excellent fare. It somewhat reminds us- or reminded us- of the excellent, \"Le Select Bistro, \" in Toronto. Sadly, in recent months, with a change in management and what is obviously a degradation of kitchen talent, things have slowly slid into mediocrity. It became abundantly clear when we ordered a few of our regular items on a recent visit: The onion soup, formerly enhanced with flavorful morsels of beef and liberally capped with cheese and crouton, was a pale shadow of its former self. A tepid, under-seasoned vegetarian version topped with a couple of baguette slices and minimal cheese. The true down side though was that the toughness of the bread indicated a trip to the microwave had been likely. The duck tartine (formerly duck CONFIT) was soggy and under seasoned. The accompanying salad, which used to have a zesty lemon-vinaigrette dressing, again- bland and oily. The beef tartine was horribly under seasoned, prompting me to actually request salt and pepper- something I'd have NEVER considered in past years. My wife's chicken tartine could have used more time under the broiler. She sent it back. The chef brought another one- exactly the same. (Ironically, it was far better the next day after a short toaster oven visit. See? Told you so.) Ever since John, the affable host, departed, things have gotten worse. Now, more staff has departed. I'll never get why, when there's a successful formula- one that NO ONE else has- someone comes along who feels a need to change it. In this case, for the (far) worse. Just sad. So unless things improve, we can no longer recommend it."}
{"text":"Lovely little Italian Bistro in Rocky River. Sit outside on a beautiful evening. We often eat at the bar too. Food and service wonderful. Best Bar in Rocky River."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and I was really impressed! We sat out on the patio which is dog friendly, so I will be bringing mine next time! The crab cake was one of the best I've ever had! I got the three course filet special for $30. Choice of soup or salad, entree and desert. They also had $25 courses, but the filet was an up charge. Priced very reasonable! Whole carafe of wine for $19!! Flour-less chocolate cake is a must at the end and paired great with the cabernet!"}
{"text":"Ok place with live music on a Thursday night which was a plus. The food was average and the cheese plate was ok. I was expecting a nice baguette or bread to go with the plate, but did appreciate the lavender honey that came instead. I did think the wine selection was great and enjoyed the friendly laid back service.   My frisée salad included what looked like  chopped lettuce commonly found in burrito joints and mediocre bread hidden at the bottom-maybe it was an off night?"}
{"text":"Have always loved this place.  Food, drinks, atmosphere, etc. are first rate.  One problem: they need to get better ventilation.  It gets very smoky in the dining room -- nothing a basic fan wouldn't fix."}
{"text":"Was there on Saturday with a group of 10.  Server was very attentive to everyone.  My strip steak was cooked perfectly and delicious.  Have been there many times and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but the last time I was here not so much. The waitress was unattentive and rude. She never acknowledged thank you, had to wait unreal times for coffee refills. She never asked if we wanted refills we had to chase her down. The steak was just ok, but compounded with the rude, lack luster service. I am not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great patio. Showed up half hour before closing and still got awesome service. Food was delicious. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Great summer lunch!  This place is a little jewel tucked away on Old Detroit (Old River).  Wonderful food, staff and service!  Make sure you try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, stuffed dates were perfect- cassoulet was exactly what it's supposed to be and the service was laid back and attentive. The chef is a guy named Chris and he's doing a great job- I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I recently came here for the first time for Happy Hour. This is one of those places you drive by all the time, hear great things about and always think \"I really need to go there sometime\". I really wish I would stop doing that and just go! 

Happy Hour was great! The restaurant is as small as it looks from the outside but the food really packs a punch! During Happy Hour they offer a selection of $5 appetizers and drinks. I ordered the mussels and stuffed peppers and I have to say the mussels are on the top of my list now for flavor! I want to go back soon just for of the mussels! This is a dish in which you wanted to soak up as much broth as possible with the bread!

I had the pleasure of going to happy hour with a friend who had already visited and here is a note to mention because the bartendar did not tell us about it...
**During Happy Hour any drinks on their cocktail list that are $8 and not part of the happy hour list and are also $5! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Adorable dimly lit restaurant! The food is incredible. Highly recommend the Brie cheese appetizer baked in a pastry crust. The French onion soup was perfect and full of thick bread, onions, and cheese. Got the beef tartine which was loaded with meat cheese and horseradish on thin baguette. Super carb heavy meal but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for happy hour and immediately felt the French bistro atmosphere when I walked in. We sat at the bar and our bartender was so friendly and attentive. They have an amazing  happy hour menu so we took advantage and ordered some drinks along with the dip duo, mussels, stuffed peppers, and the roasted goat cheese dates. Everything was SO GOOD and each is only $5 for happy hour! It's unbeatable in my opinion. I will definitely be back and hope to try the full menu, as it looks amazing as well."}
{"text":"We love this cozy, neighborhood gem. If it was closer to our neighborhood, we'd be here all the time. 

We arrived around 7:15 on a Saturday night and were seated by 7:30...wow, amazing for a Saturday night.  We started with a really reasonably priced bottle of wine which turned out to be pretty good. So far, so good. We enjoyed three cheeses and the amazing stuffed dates  with our wine. Both were excellent choices. 

Thanks to our server (the bartender since we were at the bar), our entrees were perfectly timed to arrive after our apps. I had the chicken tartine which was perfectly crunchy, creamy and flavorful. My husband had the duck confit which he enjoyed, but said it needed more goat cheese. The only issue with the dinner was our Brussels sprouts which arrived after our meal.  The server apologized and of course didn't charge us. 

All in all, a lovely evening....and worth the 45 minute drive. If you go, be sure to visit the gelato place a few doors down. Wow is all I can say!"}
{"text":"My wife had been to Tartine many years ago and enjoyed it, so we finally got around to getting me there this time.  We were seated in the back room, a reconditioned space that we much quieter and subdued than the front bar room.  Fine by us, since this was a night out for just the two of us.

Our waiter was pleasant and attentive.  We ordered cocktails, and both of us really enjoyed my selection (it was called something like \"That State Between Dreaming and Awake\") which was bourbon based, kind of like their take on an old fashioned with bitters and absinthe.

We decided to start the meal off with their chef's choice cheese board (my wife is in love with cheese).  Unfortunately the board was served too cold, but was much better once we let it warm up and the cheese time to bloom. I loved the accompanying grain mustard on the hard cheddar cheese, and the one \"funky\" soft cheese was excellent.  I also enjoyed the smoky bleu that was served.

Next, we each ordered a crock of their French onion soup.  It had such an unusual state (to start), both my wife and I thought \"licorice!\" at the same exact time...must have been made with either fennel or star anise in it.  But it was still tasty, just not very burgundy / rich in flavor.

Already pretty full, we decided to get one of their namesake sandwiches, so we chose the beef short rib tartine.  They were nice enough to split the dish for us and it was served open face with cheese topping the tender meat, an au jus for dipping and a small simple salad.  The meat was rich, and cutting off hunks of the sandwich for a dip in the jus was the perfect bite.

I'm glad we finally made it out to this spot, which is perfect for a date night or intimate evening out with friends."}
{"text":"This wonderful little bistro/wine bar is a favorite of mine for a classy happy hour.  A selection of $5 wines, $6 cocktails and $3-$5 beers. Paired with their happy hour drink specials is a small but tasty selection of menu items. I highly recommend the stuffed dates, mussels and french onion soup.

This cozy little bistro is tucked away in Old River and a great place for a girls night or a night out with your significant other. It is definitely a restaurant I want to check out for something other than happy hour."}
{"text":"This is an excellent date spot. I am reserving the 5th star for a 2nd meal there. 

It reminds me of Paris!"}
{"text":"Really cool little bistro in Rocky River.  Do-It-Yourself Cheese Plate: Mine was Belletoile, Boucheron, Blue d'Avergine.  We were just there for a mid-afternoon snack.  Would DEFINITELY come back."}
{"text":"I rarely drink. Almost never. However, I recently went to La Tartine and sat at the bar during happy hour to try their appetizers, which are $5 from 4:30 to 6:30, Tuesday through Friday.

While I was at the bar, I noticed an Absinthe fountain on a shelf, next to a bottle with some liquor in it. When I asked the bartender, Greg, he told me it was Absinthe that he had made! Awesome! I made plans to return and try this wonderful discovery.

So, last night I grabbed some accomplices and went back to La Tartine and tried the Absinthe. It was excellent! Greg is one of the best bartenders I have known in a long time, and he definitely knew what he was doing with the Absinthe. Also, he seems like a really cool guy. The restaurant was busy and I still felt like he was giving me 5 star attention. There was also live music which was low-key and entertaining, not overwhelming. To eat I had the Herb Chicken Tartine, which is always really good.

I brought girls with me, and they had a wonderful time also. They had some Cosmos that were excellently prepared and made them happy. I really like this restaurant, and that's not just the Absinthe talking."}
{"text":"While the food is always great, I unfortunately can't say the same about the service. I had hoped that I came on an off night, but the past 3 times in the last month or so has always been the same. Very very slow. Just too many good restaurants around town to afford to have such slow service. I'd love to keep going but don't want to sit around for almost 2 hours for a simple dinner."}
{"text":"First time trying this place- it was a nice surprise that Tuesdays they have half off bottles of wine. Their house pinot noir was excellent and $15 for the bottle. Had the stuffed peppers ($9) as an appetizer- they had chicken chorizo. Tasty but very small portion-- definitely not enough to share. My friend & I shared the garlic sausage pizza ($16)- it was good, perfect portion for people to share. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate torte ($6) which was amazing and had a caramel drizzle. The service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place.  It tends to attract a slightly older crowd but that is okay by me!  The Brie was very good but the French onion soup was just okay.  Quite a bit if oil in it and it tasted under seasoned to me.  I should have gotten the beet salad like my friend did!  Excellent wine list."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 10 stars! This place is so quaint and has so much character! I had the privilege of meeting the brains and heart behind Tartine.
I've been in Cleveland for 3 years and what an under rated city it is. I had been wanting to try Tartine for a very long time now and with 2 weeks left in this amazing city I had to stop by... Well I stopped by on a Monday .. The day they are closed. But it just so happened that they had a private wine paired dinner that night, I politely asked to join and thanks to a no show I was able to join! I sat with Dean, Anna and Scott and met the whole family! The food was beyond delicious- so creative and something you may have at a Michelin star restaurant in France. The pairings were amazing.. One, more delicious than the next! 
I can't recommend this restaurant enough- it's not a business - it's a passionate undertaking to offer something truly unique to Clevelanders. Anytime there's love and passion you have the recipe for a perfect home away from home. So whether you are an east sider, a west sider or a downtowner- VISIT them! You will find yourself going back! I wish I could!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place during my Cleveland trip!  The Ahhh-mazing steamed mussels in pesto broth was creamy but not too heavy or overpowering, a perfect balance of flavors, had to finish off the broth with a spoon.  The beef tenderloin was a huge win at $24, buttery tender, perfectly cooked to order, 6 oz was just right.  Served with roasted Brussels sprouts loaded with smoky flavor from the rendered cubes of some local bacon.  I would have guessed this plate to be around $32-38.  Dessert was a chocolate thing, can't remember the name but a circular slice of kind of flour less dark chocolate with salted caramel flake -- wonderful.  I don't recall the beautiful glass of wine I had, some cote du Rhone, and a lovely Campari cocktail called Bicyclette, large and refreshing, a great summer drink.  Everyone seems to know the welcoming owner. Lots of conviviality in this little place.  How do they do it from the tiny postage stamp kitchen?  It must be magic!"}
{"text":"Very unmemorable food just like every other spot in Rocky River. I guess I should cut slack for the low bar-yea, 2 stars."}
{"text":"I once sat next to the owner for some late night tacos/margaritas...so began my love for Tartine. This is a hidden gem in Rocky River. 

Everything is straight to the point - do they have a million craft beers? No. They have a couple good beers. They have a wider selection of (all fantastic) wines. And the Fig on Rye cocktail will not disappoint! Also, the bar is literally sparkling clean. Like, scary clean. 

The tartines and cheese plates are my go to. Great patio in the summer and intimate indoor seating in the less cooperative Cleveland weather."}
{"text":"We were greeted cordially and given a prime outside table for 4 w/o a reservation.
Service was great from Angel.
We had a true Tartine experience 2 of us had duck confi tartines one chicken and my pork was slightly dry the others were awesome.
The House Red wine was great snd a great value."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We had the medjool dates with goat cheese, lardons, and port wine reduction; a \"tartine\" (french open-faced sandwich) made with roasted chicken w/ apples, swiss cheese, and cranberry aioli; wild mushroom, goat cheese, leeks, and black truffle pizza on whole-wheat crust; for dessert a tart with ricotta. Every thing that we had was delicious -- no complaints on anything food related!! As the other reviewer wrote, ditto on the cannot wait to come back to try basically everything on the menu. We really had a hard time deciding what to order. We also had some house cocktails -- blackberry whiskey sour and basil lemonade something or other. I don't even like whiskey or SOUR, but I could drink those blackberry whiskey sours all night; they're made with fresh blackberry puree and house made sour!  Our server was extremely helpful and attentive. The patio was very quaint and it *almost* feels like you are not in Rocky River (my only complaint)...maybe one more blackberry whiskey sour and I can ignore the crowd!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was great! Tables were a little too close together and could easily hear other people's converstations...so made the night interesting!!

good was real good, would def. go back! Service was ok nothing too crazy but not bad.  Just right for me to come back."}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff, but expensive food and small portions. If you like to drink wine that is a very good place to go with a big selection of French/Californian and South American wines. Cocktails are very good too and at a reasonable price during happy hours.
Since the restaurant is called Tartine I was expecting more choice of tartines. I found the concept interesting since in France we usually but butter and/or jelly on a piece of bread and call it tartine. So to have meat, crab, veggies... is a nice twist.
Overall I think it is a nice place to have a glass or two and snack on some food. It is truly a Bistro and not a restaurant."}
{"text":"When you write a review, the first thing you wanna do is be a jerk to establish your credentials.  So here!  Have two things absolutely WRONG about Tartine Bistro!

1)  The purple potatoes were slightly overdone. 
2)  The medjool dates were actually more of a dessert than an appetizer. 

There.  Have I established myself as A Man Who Knows Fine Cuisine for you?  Will you believe me now when I tell you my tale of good food?  

Call me Ishmael. 

Seriously, though, for a little wine bar/restaurant, the place has excellent food, great service, and an okay atmosphere.  I started with the medjool dates, which were stuffed with goat cheese and topped with bacon in a very light port wine sauce, and they were superb - sweet, just a little flake of crunchy, and finely textured so that you could taste the layers of food within them.

Then I had a wild mushroom and truffle flatbread pizza.  The crust was a tad too crisp, but fortunately the freshness of the cheese and the tastiness of the wild mushrooms (done just right) and the shallots and the cheese made up for it.  I ate the whole thing and then regretted it, for my tummy was full.

I am not a wine person.  I drink beer.  Good beer.  This means I suffer in Cleveland.  But my friends seemed to like the wine, and made yummy noises, even as they thought it was a bit tarter than advertised.  THERE!  ANOTHER THING WRONG WITH TARTINE BISTRO!  +1 TO MY CREDIBILITY SCORE!

In the end, we got the check, and for about $25 per person we'd had a fine meal with appetizer and wine.  That's pretty decent, honestly.  The only serious ding I'd give it is that it was crowded on a Wednesday, which made it a little harder to talk because there were so many people.  Still, considering how many restaurants go out of business, I can't find it in my heart to scorn them for, you know, \"having clientele.\" 

Recommended.  Go forth and medjool date."}
{"text":"went here with a friend for lunch...loved,loved,loved this place it reminded me of Paris and NY ROLLED INTO one fine little Cartier box! Would like to try everything on the menu since it was so hard to narrow down,I like everything called food BFF is more picky but we both found a salad and sandwich that we swapped and shared and vowed to come back for more.THE WINE LIST WAS also nice and reasonably$"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a Valentine's Day lunch (he is out of town during the week). It is a cozy place with a gorgeous bar and a red tile ceiling. I had the lunch combo: mixed greens salad, fromage tartine, and legume soup. Everything was so good and the portion size was perfect. The tartine had crisp fresh bread with cheese and fresh sliced tomato. We also split the creme brulee which was really good. This is one of the best lunches out I have had in a while. I am a vegetarian and the last couple restaurants we tried just didn't do their vegetarian options well. This one was spot on. Simple and really good."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a few friends for happy hour (4-7) on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was mostly empty with a few dinner patrons out on the front patio.  The bar service was great and so was the happy hour food ($6) and wine ($5).  I enjoyed a boeuf petite tartine with a nice glass of white.  Both were yummy and didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Went tonight for restaurant week. Normally you get a smaller portion of each course for dinner. Not here! Full serving of each course and EVERYTHING was delicious. I wasn't disappointment with any of my choices. This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I took out a French onion soup tonight. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Amazing. The broth was perfectly and heavily peppered--which made it even more divine. If there was a drop of water in this broth, I did not taste it. It was rich and full-bodied. The take-out version comes in two smallish sized containers, each bearing a slice of (French?) bread soaked in the heavenly broth. Add this soup to my list of favorites on the West side."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a good food and a good glass of wine. 
Tartine has a nice cheese selection, tasty appetizers, and great pizza. 
The cocktails are very good, the beer selection is so-so, and the wine list is very good."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch here yesterday.  
This is a charming Bistro with fantastic food.
Service was great and totally enchanted by the whole experience.

I will have to get my husband here soon.  
There wine list is great.  Lunch with white burgundy can't be beat.  Soup of the day was unbelievably good.  Beet salad was perfectly prepared and almost too pretty to eat.  That didn't stop me from finishing my plate.
I never do five stars but this Bistro deserves it."}
{"text":"Girls night here was spot on. The wine was fabulous, the food was fabulous- you can't go wrong with anything you get here. Best scallops ive ever had. Will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"A quaint and welcoming spot. Too bad, as others have written, the food is off the charts salty, and the wine list is pricey. 
 The staff is friendly, but how do you make up for a cook who sends crap food out ? You would go broke comping things, but you should at least buy a drink for sending out inedible food. 
This kind of bistro food is not challenging. Soooo disappointing that it is complicated by an uneven hand in the kitchen."}
{"text":"First time going here and i was impressed.  Very cozy with a great vibe. Staff is very polite (called me sir) and batender was very knowledgable about the wine.  I would go back anytime.  Had some apps but I'm sure the food would have been awesome."}
{"text":"We have dinner at Tartine's at least once a month. Love the atmosphere. Adequate wine selections with nice cheese plates. However, this past week may have been our last meal there. We know the quality of the food is inconsistent (so we try to order things that can't go too wrong). Even these 'foolproof' dishes have become wildly inconsistent. 

I have lots of complaints about my recent meal - but I'll stick to the biggest disappointment - the French Onion Soup.

If there is ANYTHING that a French bistro should be really, really good at is it's onion soup.

This soup was a bowl of tasteless (from a can or box) beef broth with some barely sauteed onions thrown in. The 'crouton' had not been toasted and there was hardly any cheese on top. This was the saddest thing I ever ate.

The onions need to be caramelized - cooked slowly to develop color and depth of flavor. You need herbs in the broth - French thyme! You need seasonings - salt and freshly ground pepper. You need a hit of cognac. You need quality baquette slices that have been toasted. Gruyere cheese please - on top - thick.

I am encouraging you guys to follow the recipe from Julia Child. It's foolproof!

PS. Lardons (on the salad) need to be cooked - rendered. You can't chew raw bacon."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is seriously mouth watering. So much flavor. The cheese plate portions are generous. The lavender honey that comes with the cheese plates is beyond good. Staff is friendly and efficient without being over bearing."}
{"text":"Attended dinner in the dark at Tartine Bistro. Food and service was exceptional. Atmosphere  was very cozy. We were very impressed with the experience. My wife and I look forward to going back soon to try out the ala-carte menu."}
{"text":"We started sitting outside sipping cocktails and moved on to dinner.  We had the makers mule and a cucumber gin cocktail, both strong but tasty!  
We started with dates and they were great, but the other reviewers are correct... Sweet! The bacon is salty and just almost balances this app out.  
The onion soup is mild and light.  The cheese is creamy.  It makes for a different experience that I highly recommend!  Sitting outside in the summer this was the right version of French Onion. 
Next we had the duck tartine and a special Korean BBQ short ribs. The short ribs were a soft beef jerky smokey treat of an entree!  The duck confit tartine was incredible for the price.  The cheese was so creamy.  We also had some brussels as a side which were good, but no better than what we make at home. We have a killer version.
So after great music, great atmosphere, great company (that part had nothing to do with them) and a great meal - we ordered the flour-less chocolate tart with sea salt Carmel to go! 
A wonderful night out in River! I was giving them a strong 4 and then Georgia by Ray Charles came on and pushed this southern girl right over the edge.  Well played my friend Tartine, well played!  Enjoy the 5!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I was so hard with my first review of Tartine. The food is really good and although you are right on top of your neighboring table, that doesn't make it a 3. Maybe I was being too selective that day..."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write reviews, but my wife and I had such an unpleasant experience here tonight that I felt compelled to write something. We've been to Tartine a few times and the experience has usually been enjoyable - decent food and service and a nice atmosphere. But tonight was pretty bad. The couple at the table next to us was seated after we were and had the same waitress however they received their appetizer before we even got to order ours. We ended up getting the cheese board which was great. But when it came to ordering drinks, my wife ordered the peach sangria, which the waitress said they didn't have. So then my wife ordered the Market Garden wheat beer, which again was on the menu but they did not actually have. After a conversation with the waitress that concluded with the fact that they did not have any other wheat beers or similar beers, my wife got a pilsner. Then I ordered the Saison DuPont from their draft list. Which was also unavailable. Then, instead of asking what else I might want, the waitress came to the table with a bottle of beer that she said was the last one she had and was in the basement, but I could have it if I wanted. It was, no joke, a wheat beer. On a normal night this would have been a laughable experience and no problem. But then our main dishes came. My wife ordered a panzanella salad that was not what you would expect. Instead of the soaked bread that would normally come in a panzanella, this was just a regular salad with plenty of croutons. I know, a total first world problem to complain about. But I ordered the bouillabaisse and for $21 got a small handful of seafood in no more than 3 ounces of broth. It was prepared decently, but was so small that I finished it in no more than 5 minutes. Also, even though it wasn't a traditional stew that you would expect, I still couldn't enjoy the broth because there was no spoon given to me with the meal. After waiting for 10 minutes, my wife was finally able to get the waitress's attention and I asked for a spoon or bread to soak up the broth. In the meantime, the couple next to us finished their meal (which was the same amount of courses as ours), got their check, and left.  Instead of just getting a spoon and bringing it over, I waited another 5 minutes and was brought 2 small pieces of toasted bread that couldn't even be used to soak up the small amount of broth - and still no spoon.  People make mistakes and I'm sure this isn't the typical experience here, but I wanted to post this review so everyone knows what can happen. Our bill was over $60 and our experience was not worth that at all."}
{"text":"The Tartine Bistro is a small but classy restaurant and wine bar located in Rocky River, Ohio.  This bistro-style restaurant is the perfect place to stop and enjoy a wonderful meal in-between shopping at some of the nearby stores or have a romantic evening with someone special.  Indoor and outdoor seating options are equally impressive, but I opted for one of the small outdoor tables since it was a cool but pleasant evening.  The beautifully-strung outdoor lighting added to the ambiance of this cafe-style seating option.  

After being seated, I was immediately greeted by my waiter, Lorenzo.  He was friendly and professional throughout my visit, and continuously monitored my dining needs to ensure my satisfaction.  I asked a few questions about their selections and his advice on their menu was informative.  
 
I started my meal with their house red wine, which originated from Rhone Valley, France.   For my entree, I selected the salmon, which included roasted root vegetables and a rapini lemon and fennel purée.   My entree was prepared and delivered with perfection.  Their red wine along with my meal was a wonderful experience for my tastebuds, and the cool evening breeze in their outdoor seating area was rather pleasant.  The high level of ambiance of their outdoor seating just added to the enjoyment of this experience. 
 
Bravo to the owner and staff at this restaurant for a wonderful experience.  They have earned the rare and coveted five stars!"}
{"text":"Tartine is fantastic! My husband and I have been here a few times and have always had a great experience and wonderful dishes. The ambiance is perfect for long conversations, and lots of wine:) The place is small, so smaller parties work the best. 

Starting with drinks - even though I typically order wine (they are a wine bar!), the last time I went, I ordered their French Margarita. One of the best margarita's I've had. It's a play on a French Martini with chambord. Their wine list is nice and allows you to order many by the glass. I love whatever French Pinot Noir they have on their menu, nice and light for the summer. 

As for their hors d'oeuvres - all that I've tried have been great - dates, stuffed peppers, tuna crudo. All the salads I've had are nice, and  of a nice size. My husband loves the frisee salad. And of course, their cheese display is delicious. I believe they offer 5 different cheeses, all nice sized portions. 

I'd recommend ordering an appetizer or salad to start and then an entree if you are really hungry. 

Entrees: 
I've never had a tartine (french, open-faced sandwich) but have tried the brisket version and it was definitely tasty! My favorite dish is their chicken - I know it sounds boring, but it was recommended to me over their filet. That's saying something! I believe they only have it during the fall and winter though. The last time I was there, I had the pork tenderloin with blood orange sauce over risotto. Cooked perfectly and really filling! Their scallops, whatever seasonal preparation, are always delicious. 

I typically go for wine for dessert, but I've heard good things about their dessert menu. 

Go on a Tuesday for their half price bottles of wine. But you won't regret going any day of the week!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. Just went back again Saturday. The wild mushroom pizza is amazing. Service is always great."}
{"text":"I love Tartine. I have only been there a few times but every experience has been ideal. 

The intimate, well lit (ambiance style) bar and restaurant is cozy and welcoming. I had a potential party of 10 coming in and while they don't accept reservations they were understanding and extremely accommodating when I called in ahead of time.  

The happy hour is spectacular. $5 glass of red and white, along with a $5 martini list, including the classic cosmo coupled with contemporary concoctions like they key lime pie martini and $3 dortmunders and some random beer are a great happy hour selection all its own. Pair that with an extensive appetizer list and this 4:30-6:30p M-F happy hour is a hit. The cheese plate featuring 3 varieties, crackers, honey and raisins is delicious. The stuffed pepper is as enticing as it is fulfilling. The dates can be an app or a dessert. Each gem is only $5 so a strategically timed happy hour can mean minimal damage on the pocketbook with your taste buds left begging for more.

Tartine is a hidden gem. The staff is friendly, the space beautiful and the cuisine and libations are delightful."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 2.5 stars option. This place was very inconsistent within a single meal and that makes me love/hate this place. 

To start out this restaurant is gorgeous. It reminds me of so many cafes in France. Sadly the exposed brick and hardwood floors do make for kind of loud reverberating sound when the restaurant is crowded but for a good french meal I'd be willing to speak up. 

The wine selection seemed well standard fare. Some good bottles others just label good. My mom and I shared a bottle of Pinot Noir. I don't think it was aptly described on the wine list but it was very good. They had a decent beer list. Their cocktail menu had an odd martini on it that was pink which my father enjoyed but it was mostly cold vodka. Anyways. I digress. Let's get to the matter at hand the food. 

We started with a cheese plate. 3 artisanal cheeses, honey, fig jam, crackers, candied nuts, and dried fruit. The cheeses were yummy but they really didn't do much there. The lavendar infused honey however I could have licked the plate clean of the honey. It was amazing and the lavendar was not overpowering. No soapy tasting honey here. 

Then the soup. OMG the soup. Onion soup gratinee. Heavenly just Heavenly. The best onion soup I have ever tasted. With aged cheddar broiled to bubbling on top with fresh baguette baked in. It was orgasmic. My mom ate beet salad which she enjoyed but I can't imagine it was nearly as good as the soup. 

This is where the good stops. Sadly my entree left a lot to be desired. My husband had the filet which I hate to put it this way unless you cook the crap out of it it is going to taste good and it was perfectly cooked. My mother had the lamb stew. It was ok. I thought the mashed potatoes tasted a little fake but I'm picky about spuds. 

My father and I both had tartines. My father had the brisket. He liked it. There was a lot of beef and really in his world it does not get much better than a plate full of beef on bread. I had the duck confit. It was salty, over-cooked, dry, and well only duck no confit. It had a few measly pieces of over cooked brie on top but really brie and duck do not good bed fellows make. The flavor of duck is too delicate for cheese. Sadly all I wanted was something to cover the taste of the dry unpalatable duck. I didn't eat much of my entree. I instead dreamed of more soup. 

The desert menu was nothing spectacular so we skipped the sweet. It was sadly a bad end to an otherwise good meal. 

I suppose I will try it again and hopefully I just caught this place on a bad day and normally the duck confit is as amazing as everything else so until then. . . 

Don't miss:
Onion soup gratinee

Hit or miss:
Speaking to your dinner companions

Avoid like the plague:
As much as it pains me to say stay away from the duck. . . . stay away from the duck."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little row of shops in Rocky River, Tartine is a cozy dimly lit eatery. The decor and ambiance is of a romantic cafe. With a large bar that is over sized in proportion to the overall space, leads to closely grouped tables and some leaving barely elbow room between dining patrons. The staff are friendly and are always around when needed. 

Tartine has a limited menu that offers a good variety of starters, salads, and a rotating set of entrees. The menu seem to cater to both meat and non-meat eaters. They also offer a good listing of wines by the bottles and glass. During my last visit I started with a crisp oaky Chardonnay and their beet salad. The salad had a combination of two types of perfectly roasted beet with winter greens, crumbled goat cheese and a slight drizzle of and balanced portion of honey vinaigrette dressing.  My entree was the lamb stew that came in a side dish sized bowl and prepared  with a medley of vegetables and a sweet aromatic sauce. I found the lamb overlooked in the stew to the point that it had lost its lamb taste. The meat could have very well have been pulled pork or steak. The dish was far too sweet as if it has been cooked far too long. In addition, the served portion to the price of the dish is very disproportionate. The other entree - Coq Au Vin was at best standard and again of small portion compared to the price point. Let me summarize that after spending $75+ for two glasses of wine, two salads, and two entrees; we both walked out feeling very hungry. Our Tartine experience was overcast by the poor quality of the entree and the disproportionate pricing of these items. 

The salad, drinks were good and I've heard their pizza are good but without trying them I can't really vouch for their quality. My suggestion is that you visit Tartine knowing that the pricing is high compared to the food served that are OK. The ambiance is good for some drinks or light food to have while enjoying good conversation over a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Patio is very nice and they have a great vibe on Sunday nights with live music playing. Looking forward to going again soon!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times, and every time is great.  The Duck Confit tartine is awesome.  The wine selection is great.  The cheese and meat tray is very good."}
{"text":"Very good food. The only problem I had was I found a piece of onion in my coffee. The first time I went there the bread that was brought out had mold on it...."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.   Friendly service.  Unique dishes that you won't find elsewhere.   I had the short ribs, but I'm coming back at lunchtime to try a tartine.  

Perfect place for a date.  Cozy and romantic.   

Great drinks and desserts too.  Give other a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We went last Friday at 6pm and I was so happy we got there early.  They don't take reservations and they fill up quickly!   We had the steak tatare and is prepared perfectly.  The French onion soup is topped with cheddar cheese- it was good, but not the best I've had.  We ordered a number of small plates including the crab claw man cheese it was super yummy and bubbly.  We did have a couple of pieces of shell in the dish and the server removed it from the bill.  I love that this French delight is so close to home!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great wine, my favorite atmosphere in the area. Bartender would not allow us to sit at one of the many open tables while we waited for an outdoor table on our last visit. A bit odd. Also was served a bad glass of wine which was graciously replaced. Staff acted surprised I was right once they tasted it. They explained it was a freshly opened bottle. Though they were nice they kind of seemed not to really believe me at first. Will still go back again and again."}
{"text":"Another great experience here. Delicious Brie and I also enjoyed the salad that I got. We have found our yearly Valentine's day spot!  I also love that they don't rush you. For a small restaurant, they don't mind if you linger and sip on your glass of wine for an additional hour."}
{"text":"We used to eat here on a fairly regular basis. I'm not sure why, but we had not been here in about a year. That will not happen again. We had an exceptional meal here last night. The wine choices offered by our server were excellent. The salads were as good as any that we've ever had. We shared a mushroom pizza that was out of this world. The banana bread pudding was so good we would have licked the plate if we weren't in public.  I can't say enough about this gem of a restaurant. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We got some lunch take-out from Tartine to fill our craving for some fancy French food. When I walked in everyone seemed to stare at me, but hey, I'm not dressing up just to pick up take-out! But it's a cute little place and the staff were friendly. Our bill came to $44, the portions aren't that big, but keep in mind this is a more \"up-scale\" kind of place. On to the food!

Stuffed Peppers - Only two small stuffed peppers, but they were good. 
Stuffed Dates - OMG so delicious, but I wish there was more of them!
Cauliflower Gratin - This was good, but it definitely is heavy. 
Duck Tartine with salad - Brie, fig preserves, duck, YUM! The side salad is very simple with just lettuce though.
Heirloom Tomato Pizza - Okay, but a little greasy and I didn't really like the cornmeal on the dough. 

All in all, I would definitely check this place out again as the dates and tartine were really good!"}
{"text":"I am not overwhelmed. Been here twice and found the food to be just ok. Had the strip steak (38$) on my most recent visit. Good flavor but the meat was tough. My daughter loves the ambiance so we will be back."}
{"text":"I went to Tartine Bistro on a weekend night. We had gotten there early, around 5:45, and were easily able to grab a table. We had started sitting outside (super cute patio) but it was muggy and began to rain so we moved inside. This restaurant is tucked into a little plaza on Detroit Road so it is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. The service was great here. The food was just alright. I ordered the crab tartine and my mom ordered the scallops. I thought the tartine was not as flavorful as I would've liked. It was just a cheesy piece of bread with some crab on it. The simple salad that came with it was also simple- just some lettuce and dressing. I had heard great things about this place so was expecting more. It was a cute, quaint spot for a date night or girls night out. I would give their brunch a try."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place, and had the best meal I've had in a long time!  So lets get to it...

The atmosphere is perfect.  It's beautifully decorated and dimly lit. I've never been to Paris, so this will have to do. Someone mentioned it being a bit snug, but I liked that. We walked in around 7:30 on a Thursday night with no wait.  Our server was great. We had wine as soon as we walked in, salads within 10 minutes of ordering, and dinner within 10 minutes of finishing our salads. We got the house red wine.  A carafe will run you about $20.  This is about $20 cheaper than any other bottle on the menu and it was not too dry, which is how I like it.

My magnificent journey through dinner began with the frisee salad - bacon lardons (French makes anything sound beautiful), fried egg, brioche, hollandaise vinaigrette.  Now THIS is my kind of salad!  It was rich and decadent.  Next up was the Beef Brisket Tartine.  This place knows what they're doing here.  The brisket was tender and juicy. The bread was perfectly toasted.  The cheddar added the perfect amount of creaminess and salt, and the thin line of horseradish aoili married it all together.  I needed to spread this joy with my man!  Never has a man regretted ordering a filet, until this night.  I must try every tartine on this menu!  No dessert to report on.  You may think the portions look small, but let your tummy do the talking!  Everything was quite filling.

A word of warning: make sure your wallet is full when you come here!  Especially if you refill your carafe!  Our bill for two salads, two entrees, and yes, two carafes of the house red wine, was about $90.  A little indulgent for us 20-somethings, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went out with friends to this restaurant that was recommended by a mutual acquaintance. (There were four of us) We wanted to check out the Old Detroit road area for a while now and this seemed like a good opportunity. This is a quaint little restaurant not much seating inside, but it was too cold yet to sit outside. The bar area is part of the restaurant proper with a large back room for parties. The wait staff were very polite and made sure to look out for customers needs. We made reservations about a month prior, we show up and the restaurant is full with no table waiting for us. We were told to sit at the bar and wait a little bit. We waited for an hour after I had to flag down the hostess and manger to ask why they didn't hold our reservation. We were making plans to go to any of the numerous other restaurants in the area when we were finally seated. The manager comped our drinks which was very nice, however two members of our table didn't have any alcoholic drinks. Overall the food was well prepared and deserts were fresh and tasty. I do recommend the fromage plate the pickled onions were very good. Overall I would recommend this place if you're in Rocky River and don't mind waiting. I'm sure they are able to accommodate more when the patio is open, but they shouldn't depend on that. I would have rated them higher if they didn't take reservations, we would have planned to be there earlier and dealt with the wait. When I have a reservation I plan on being seated within 15 minutes of arrival."}
{"text":"So we are east siders who were looking for a different experience.  We visited Paris for the first time a few months ago and were intrigued by this place's description.  What a pleasant surprise.  They have no reservations, so try to get there before 730.  We were greeted at the door by the owner and led to our table.  Very busy and cozy.  Brief menu with nice variety of selections.  Nice wine list.  Nice seasonal specials.  Our waitress could not have been more helpful or attentive.  We had the mussels and dates for appetizers.  Mussels were a generous portion, very flavorful and unique.  The dates were simply amazing, we could not stop eating them until they were gone.  The portions were so generous, I am glad we did not order salads.  Maybe next time, because they seemed very interesting.  We got the seafood special, and it was perfectly prepared.  They have an open kitchen and we saw the food passed to the window and directly to us.  Nice desserts and after dinner drinks.  The experience was actually better than anything we experienced in Paris, and one of the best experiences we had in the Cleveland area.  Yes there are regulars here, but we certainly felt welcome.  Definitely will return to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"Great Staff, Great Food!
I have made it my go to for comfort, elegance, relaxation AND fun!
The happy hour is unique and pocket friendly. The cocktails are creative along with affordable high quality wines. Dean the owner was very flexible about music ideas and easy to talk to AND cares about the customer. Nicole, Olivia, Ryan and BJ (sorry if i left out names) are incredibly courteous and make sure each customer gets special attention. Great place for a date or solo, so don't be scurrred lol..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the \"supersize me option with unlimited fries and quantity over quality...then this isn't the restaurant for you.  But if you value flavor, and quality over quantity then read on.

First,  I wish there was a ten star option!  This restaurant is absolutely deserving of more than just five stars.  Here's why...

My now husband and I have been coming here for over 5 years now and we refer to Tartine as \"our place\".  This restaurant is THE most consistent restaurant you could ever have the pleasure of enjoying.  No matter what time of day or night, you will receive the best service and he absolute best meal.  

Our favorites:   Hands down their filet mignon is THE BEST you will find. The cut is delicious and the chef knows how to cook steak to perfection! 

The chorizo stuffed peppers...funky and delightful.  These magnificent appetizers are great for sharing and won't fill you prior to your meal. 

I dare you to find a better French onion soup...double dog dare you!  

I always see the owner making an appearance every time we are there introducing himself to the patrons and making sure he runs a tight ship.  

The ambience is one to be enjoyed by all.  Casual yet completely appropriate for a fancy night out on the town.  While the surround sound echoes a tad, you can hear the faint musical notes of a French bistro.  

Delightful in every way.  I hope you enjoy this place as we do!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty close to being \"regulars\" here, especially in winter when this is the coziest place to be listening to live music on Thursdays.  We routinely take our friends/family here when they visit Cleveland.  We are completely hooked on getting the following courses to share amongst our group:  
- chorizo stuffed peppers w saffron aioli (aioli actually steals the show)
- goat cheese stuffed dates (my brother accurately described at the best food he's tasted in a long while)
- frisée salad (it's like breakfast for dinner!)
- 2-3 of the Tartines to share 

Oh and the beer menu here just keeps getting better.  Try pairing this 3 course meal with a Belgian beer.  Mmm!

I like to leave good reviews for my favorite restaurants.  This one is pretty much at the top of my list for the dishes above and the great staff.  

Note - You need to be a meat eater to enjoy the menu in my opinion, but this should be expected with French cuisine."}
{"text":"Yes, Tartine! Yes!
We live within walking distance of Tartine and have been enjoying it for years. 
Under the new ownership a great happy hour was added and the only downturn is that the bar fills up quickly!
The food is great and the wine and liquor selection shouldn't leave anybody too disappointed unless you are into some micro brewed beer or tequila or.... you get the point. This is a French-inspired Bistro. 
Perfect for lovers of small plates like my finance and me. 
The patio is lovely in the summer. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Tartine is one of those cozy, elegant places that reminds you of a hidden Parisian bistro.  The owner, a happy man with a comforting presence, walks from table to table to make sure everyone is doing fine.  My first trip here was for Valentine's Day, very cliche but I'm not one to care.  We had the delicious mussels in a smooth white bean and wine sauce.  The plump mussels were the star of the bowl, unlike most places that drown out the taste with garlic and butter.
The salads are the perfect appetizer side and always come with crisp, fresh ingredients.  The steak is fork tender with a peppercorns and roasted potatoes. 
Interesting enough, I've never had a tartine here.  The specials always look so good.  That's my next trip though
The desserts tend to change but are always good.
The prices are good, the food is amazing.  You can't help but feel you just took place in something special."}
{"text":"Tartine opened just a couple months ago and is already doing thriving business.  The atmosphere and decor are French bistro-style without getting kitschy - the space benefits from a bare brick wall and pressed tin ceiling.  The seating is comfortably spaced, with a nice patio area and large doors that open to give an indoor/outdoor feeling in pleasant weather.

But the food is what you want to come for.  The preparations are lively and the ingredients very fresh.  My husband started with the medjool dates stuffed with goat cheese, which were outstanding - so sweet that I would consider ordering them as dessert.  The salad frisee with bacon and a poached egg was perfectly dressed and delicious.  We each had a pizza: he, the wild mushroom and goat cheese, which was savory and delicious; I, the bacon and peaches - a seasonal offering - that had just the right balance of sweet and savory.  Our friends both had the Fillet Mignon, accompanied by a medley of purple and Yukon Gold potatoes, which they pronounced delicious.  The only nitpick of the evening was that the purple potatoes could have been cooked slightly longer.  The prices were very reasonable and the wait staff extremely attentive.  We will definitely be returning, and are looking forward to the seasonal changes in the menu."}
{"text":"Oven baked dates stuffed with goat cheese. Holy deliciousness! My French cuisine obsessed friend introduced me to this place, and suddenly I feel sad to leave Cleveland. Places like this truly makes it worthy of staying here. Hidden in the very heart of Rocky River downtown, surrounded by stores selling shoes and bridal dresses at the price of private jets, Tartine bistro has that enchanting intimate posh atmosphere of the Parisian café. Don't get me wrong. Prices are not low and portions are not huge, but if you want to try out some fresh exotic dishes, it's the place to be. We were not on any kind of romantic escapade, so just hit the jackpot by ravaging happy hour ( only $5 each) specials: we had mussels (delicious with broth), beet salad ( did you know there is such thing as yellow beets?), dates mentioned above and house wine ( decent) and also $5. Staff was very accommodating, letting us order items from happy hour even though there was only couple of minutes left till the end of it.
With less than $40, we had an entire France on our plate, literally. Now this place is not a hip joint, your waitress will be polite, won't \"honey\" you, with hair and no tattoos, there will be no bartender with muscles and attitude. The crowd is a little bit geriatric, no \"window-shopping\" here. Whoever comes here should be solely interested in their company and good French cuisine. You know the way it was when the good dining was only about having a good meal in a classy quiet place. Like a century ago."}
{"text":"Treated my parents yesterday evening for an early Father's day celebration.  My dad absolutely loved it!  We had great service, and extremely tasty food.  

For appetizers I had mussels, which were delicious.  My mother ordered dates and my dad tried the beet salad.  Both enjoyed their dishes.  For entrees, my mother had the duck confit.  My father ordered the sea scallops and I ordered the cod.  All of us thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.  Service was excellent - entrees were brought out AFTER we had enjoyed and completed our appetizers, which unfortunately seems to be a rare occurrence these days.  For dessert, we shared two of the flourless chocolate tortes.  Very good, and by the time we left we were stuffed!  But we enjoyed our evening.  

This was my second visit and both times I've not been disappointed.  Price point is a little higher and portions are not large, but both times the food was prepared well and service was also good.  I have only sat inside, but there is a patio and they keep the doors open.  

We have never been to France, but this restaurant reminds us of a bistro we went to on several occasions in Toronto, Canada. Now that I found Tartine Bistro, I'm missing Le Select a little less."}
{"text":"We were so excited to dine at Tartine as our friends recommend it, for \"good French food\" we were very disappointed with our experience.  We started with the Cheese platter and they only offered 3 French cheeses of the 5 and the other 2 were Wisconsin White cheddar and then I ordered the filet and pommes dauphinoise and I have never had such a salty meal presented to me. I took 2 bites and could not finish.  My husband ordered Bouillabaisse and he said the fish was good but was way too salty.  We both were very dissatisfied and will not be back.
The waitress was also not warm or friendly."}
{"text":"Stuffed peppers were awesome but it's one pepper. It's small but packs a punch."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tartine. Was very good. Loved the salad dressing. Yum yum! Lots of bread (and carbs) but this is a great little hole in the wall kind of place!"}
{"text":"Great food! A little pricey but definitely worth it! Service by Vanessa was great!"}
{"text":"Went here on my holiday visit to Cleveland with my bff from high school.

The space is adorable and the food was delicious.  Service was good.  The best part though?  The bill!  We got a tartine (duck confit with fig jam and brie), a pizza (peppers and sausage), dessert (flourless chocolate cake), half a carafe of wine, and a glass of dessert wine for less than $50.  

I can't wait to come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Very rude server. Extremely rude. 

The whole place smelt of burning food. It definitely took away from the atmosphere.

The place itself is cute. The layout is adorable, and would be fun for a girls night. If only they fired their entire staff and rehired kind servers. 

Seriously, the servers and the kitchen staff started screaming at each other in front of our table. It was incredibly immature and rude. 

In all, I won't go back. Probably ever. And unless you want horrible service and snotty waitresses, I suggest you don't go either.

Only looking out for you people."}
{"text":"I wish so badly I could leave a 3.5 here. For starters, know that Tartine is lovely. I came for brunch and really enjoyed sitting outside on this cute street in Rocky River. I had a delicious bloody mary and loved the cozy, comfortable vibe on the dog friendly patio. The service was friendly and attentive.

I ordered the french toast. It was presented nicely but didn't have a killer flavor the way I hoped. I was really feeling the atmosphere, so it felt a little anticlimactic to get such a basic dish. I would have also loved just the smallest amount of fruit or color on the plate (didn't see any options on their new brunch menu to order a side.) I can't even really think of anything else to say about the experience. It was just... fine.

Overall, it was a nice experience, but wasn't memorable for me. I wanted to fall in love with this charming place. I do want to come back, and will-- but for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and I have NEVER had a bad meal. This is one of my wife's and I favorite places to eat on the west side!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years and the food has never disappointed. 

I love the Old River area and this restaurant fits in perfectly with the area. The restaurant is dim and cozy inside with only about a dozen tables. During the summer seating is increased a bit by a small patio of outdoor seating. There is also a small bar with seating that spans the length of the restaurant. 

Everything I've had here has been excellent. The Tartines are always delicious with crunchy bread, plenty of meat, and covered in cheese. All of the salads I've had are really good and include many good ingredients. My favorite was the Frisee, but that wasn't on the menu on my most recent visit. Of course the French Onion Soup is a signature item since they are a French restaurant and for good reason.

On my most recent visit, a Sunday, Tartine was offering a Sunday Supper special. Three courses for $25 with a couple of options for an additional $5. This was a great deal so my friend and I both ordered from that menu. 

The Mixed Berry Salad was light and refreshing with mixed berries and a light vinaigrette topping. The Scallops were perfectly prepared and the rice risotto underneath was to die for. The seasoning on the risotto was fantastic and there were nicely prepared vegetables mixed in. The Lemon Tart was okay with a nice tart lemon filling, but the outer part was a light shell instead of a thick crust. My friend ordered the Half Chicken which looked fantastic with a nice cherry sauce and plenty of vegetables on the side. She really enjoyed her meal and plenty to take home as leftovers as well.

I've always come to Tartine for the food and just kind of forgiven the service. Service isn't awful, but it has never been overly friendly or great either. I've been there no less than a couple dozen times and have never been wow'd by service."}
{"text":"I had a great first experience here! 

The setting is intimate and cozy. Dim lights, a small setting, and live acoustic music. Not bad for a drizzly summer Thursday evening! 

As someone else stated, Tartine blends in with the Old River area nicely. A little wonderland of tiny classy establishments and string lights. 

The menu is small, one page with the front being food and the back being wines. The pizzas and tartines as well as a soup and salad combo will set you back $15/$16 give or take. The entrees hover around $25, and most wines range from $7-$9 a glass. 

I got the tomato pizza. I loved that it had yellow heirloom tomatoes on it, although I wish they were sliced better so each piece had a decent portion of them. They had crushed red pepper and the crust was crunchy so I was quite happy. My dinner date had the scallop entree which she liked (although she'd never admit otherwise). Our server was a little awkward and always running around but she was prompt and got the job done. This would be a great date night spot but the lack of reservations places some uncertainty on that. Then again, I think if they took them the only way to get in this place would be calling in weeks ahead!  I think the live music really made this place even more charming than it already is."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. My friend and I loved nearly everything about Tartine. [Hard to imagine what set Daniel B off.]  We were there Saturday for lunch and enjoyed a cheese platter, a lovely white Burgundy (reasonably priced), a frisee salad (delicious), and a (delectable) heirloom tomato pizza with pesto drizzled on top. We would highly recommend the pizza: very thin crust  and fresh slices of red and green tomatoes - great in its simplicity.  Finally, about the decor: there is a charming outdoor seating area - and the inside has a nice bistro feel. This is a restaurant that is comfortable with itself. [I go to Paris often (Daniel B take note) and appreciated the ambiance here for its unpretentiousness.]"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a long time, and the first thing I noticed was a much smaller menu. This made me happy. I like to see places doing a handful of things really well rather than trying to show me how much their walk-in can hold. Besides, the core stuff is still here, like the namesake tartines, fresh salads, handful of fish and meat entrees, and lovely appetizers. I had one of their razor-thin wheat crust pizzas and a perfect summer melon salad. The husband had a duck confit tartine with a mussel appetizer. We split a very affordable bottle of French white. A warm, languid evening on the patio. Exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"I ordered roasted chicken and they brought me stuffing on a piece of bread with cheese melted on it. The staff was nice and brought me beet salad instead which was good."}
{"text":"Beautiful little find in Rocky River!  The hot, humid weather took us past the patio dining and inside the restaurant.  As lovely as it was from the outside, it was charming on the inside.  Kind of like walking into a little place in Paris....which means they've achieved their goal!  The red-painted pressed tin-ceiling, beautiful old wood floors, antiques, and the big paintings of the Eiffel Tower create the mood.  Enough about the setting....on to the food!

Potato and chive soup was the special soup of the day.  I ordered that and the crab ceviche.  Wonderful combination!  This wasn't any thick, floury, pasty potato soup....it was light, delicate, redolent of sweet cream and delicately seasoned.  It was honestly the best potato soup I've ever had.  The crab ceviche was actually an appetizer - I wanted something light after soup.  This beautiful plate was composed of a fan of perfectly ripe avocado topped with a lightly dressed mound of sweet, fresh, crab claw meat, drizzled with a red pepper aioli that had a little bit of appreciated kick!  Another drizzle of mango puree was a nice counterpoint - a little citrusy, a little sweet - against all the other flavors.  Divine.  On to dessert!

My perennial chocolate craving was perfectly satisfied with this tiny, moist chocolate cake, drizzled with peanut butter caramel and surrounded by a lovely sea salt.  Again, just a perfect balance.  

Very nice wine list, too!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner before an event. Brie appetizer was delicious, the tartines are huge-beef brisket one was amazing. Mushroom pizza was really good with plenty to take home. French onion soup was a little salty but that was my only complaint. Kind of a romantic place but I'll Likely be back...the area of rocky river it's in is adorable."}
{"text":"What a gem. Came here for an upscale night out, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the results. The prices - for what you get - seriously aren't that bad. I had a great reisling, shared the cheese plate (awesome), and ordered the duck at the waitress's suggestion. I usually rather dislike duck, so when a restaurant can prepare it so that I love it, they've made a believer out of me. It's a gorgeous, very romantic and ambient place."}
{"text":"Ok...  not bad.  Decent wine selection, nice ambiance in a smaller space, but loud.

Cheese board was good, nice starter to the meal.

Service was fast, but I just felt like they could have put a little more effort into the entrees.  They were slapped on the plate and seemed pretty uninspired.  My wife said the special was good (grouper), but my coq au vin was bland.

Will give them another shot though - some of the menu items sounded good enough to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Ideal menu for the times. Not expensive, just tastes that way. Reasonable portions, so you are not paying for wasted food. Fresh ingredients will keep me coming back. Selections of wines by the glass is a strong feature. Sure, it can be a little crowded and noisy, so go a little early or a lot late."}
{"text":"Small venue but short wait time...and certainly with it. Great service and food to go along."}
{"text":"Fancy enough to go with your girls or love interest for a nice dinner. Laid back enough to go after shopping or even a day on the golf course. love the scallops there."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!

Started with crab cakes, I'll tell ya, they are in the top 5 of all the ones I have had. 
The onion soup IS the best in town! 

Entree, I got the filet with potatoes, steak, while it was done to perfection, I felt it was a bit overpriced with the size and the amount of potatoes given with it. The presentation, eh! But wouldn't take away a star for the review. 

ONLY issue, how can you plan a date night here if there is NO possibility of making a reservation? With a place that small, I feel you should be able. Reviews I've read say the place is \"uppity\", I can see where people would come away with that impression,  but only by a few of the staff! (Honesty is all I'm staying from my observation). 

Wish I was able to get to try a desert! But that will happen if we come back!"}
{"text":"FULL DISCLOSURE:  The chef is the son of one of my coworkers.

Despite its address on Detroit, this fantastic little place is actually on Old Detroit nestled in the Old River Shopping Area.  From the outside, it looks like what I would imagine a street side bistro in Paris looking like.  Inside, a somewhat modern take on an elegant intimate dinner-spot.  Unfortunately, with all of the hard surfaces (hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, and tin ceiling) the sound bounces around, and when full, it can be rather noisy.

The cocktail and wine menu was simple, but with choices for varied tastes.  The wife and MIL shared a bottle of Pinot Noir, while the FIL had a vodka martini, and I had a (delicious) Ommegang Rare Vos.

We started with a selection of three cheeses from the cheese board, served with crackers, fig spread, and honey.  The MIL had a roasted beet salad that she seemed rather pleased with, while the wife, the FIL, and myself reveled in the onion soup gratinée.  The soup was rich, and the cheese was delectable.

For mains, MIL had the Lamb Stew, which she kept commenting over and over on how good it was.  The FIL ordered the Beef Brisket tartine, and though he was well satisfied with the taste, ended up taking more than half of his entrée home.  The wife ordered the Duck Confit tartine, and though the presentation was beautiful, sadly the duck was over cooked (cooked, shredded, and cooked again on the sandwich) and sadly was WAY over salted.  My Filet, medium-rare, was delicious, and practically cut itself.

We were all too full, and sadly disappointed with the options, to try desert, and sat comfortably while we finished our drinks.

All-in-all, I did enjoy the experience.  Though pricey, the meal was very enjoyable.  The chef clearly has skill (his background is as an \"opener\" for high-end steak joints, and was evident in his preparation of my filet) though I feel that he is hamstrung by the \"French\"-ish cuisine on the menu.  A solid 4 stars, 4.5 if you order strategically playing to the chef's strength on the grill."}
{"text":"Great find. Lovely little place. We started with the cheese plate. All three selection were really good. They are served with crackers, fig jam, nuts and lavender honey. 
We tried the steamed mussels and white beans. Top notch is all I can say. The duck confit tartness were served open face and were moist and delicious. They were served with a little side salad. Really good. 
And the wine! Wide selection and the server even offered a half glass option."}
{"text":"Tartine Bistro has to be one of the most charming 'date night' spots in Northeast Ohio.  As you approach from the outside, the establishment has such a wonderful vibe of a cute, unique, and welcoming bistro that one may find on the streets of Arles, France.  My fiancèe and I absolutely loved the atmosphere inside as well.  We both had deliciously crafted cocktails that were perfect for each of us: strong and boldly flavorful for me, and sweet for her.  After a hard decision on whether to sit in the cozy and unique indoor area, we decided to enjoy the wonderful weather on the patio - which is a great choice here (though either would be).  Our meals were equally delicious (and well paired with French Vin),we both had different tartines which are open faced sandwiches - and trust me, their tartines are farrrr more than sandwiches.- they were absolutely delicious and incredibly flavorful as were the sides, seriously so good.  And everything was well priced too! We had an appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails, and 2 dinners - all for a little over a Benjamin.  Well worth the price.  If you're looking for a cute and cozy place to have a fun, chill, evening, Tartine is highly recommended."}
{"text":"We checked out Tartine for the first time during Cleveland Restaurant Week. $33 for a glass of wine, appetizer, entree and dessert isn't bad. 

The atmosphere was quaint and charming, and each table had little candles. The food was very good. I started with the basque shrimp to reminisce about my time studying in northern Spain. It was almost as good as the real thing  They are obviously known for their tartine, which is an open-faced sandwich. I had they chicken one, and it was really creamy and rich (delicious but definitely not as healthy as I'd like). We split three desserts for the table. Out of the pumpkin creme brûlée, flourless chocolate cake and apple tart, the chocolate fiend in me preferred the cake. It has this great salty caramel sauce. 

The waiter got the order wrong for one of my friends, and kindly offered to put in her correct order. A little mistake, but water under the bridge. I'd recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. I have to admit, it can feel a little \"yuppy\" but I love hanging out at the bar and sitting at the patio. I have had appetizers and drinks here a few times now and absolutely love it. Would be perfect for a date night or girls night out! 
 
The basque shrimp and baked Brie is amazing! Actually, everything I've ever tried has been great :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Been there twice and not disappointed. Great appetizers and wonderful entries. The portion sizes were good - not huge - but I left feeling completely satisfied - not stuffed. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"J'ai mange a Tartine avec mon cher chou, aujourd'hui.  No, I'll stop.  I don't want to review a good restaurant with bad french.

THE FOOD:  We started with the medjool dates and the foie gras.  I was horribly dissapointed.  The foie gras was seared on the top and otherwise STONE COLD.  They also didn't bother to remove any of the veins.  Just Awful. Quelle dommage!

The dates were delicious--  bacon, and dates stuffed with goat cheese.  Instead of the usual preparation-- the dates wrapped in bacon, the dish was served as a plate of stuffed dates topped with crispy bacon crumbles.  If you got a bite of date and a hearty bit of crumble, it was well balanced, otherwise the dish was too sweet.  Perhaps they should stick to the traditional way of preparing this.  

So after the dissapointing appetizers, I was not hopeful about our entress.  Luckily, I was surprised and overwhelmed by the excellent food.   I had the roast pork tartine with gruyere.  Mon Dieu!  The tender, juicy roast pork was intensely, but appropriately flavoerd with herbs.  It sat atop a very crisp slice of french bread smeared with dijon mustard and aoili.  The vivid flavors were well balanced.  Joyeux!!!

The grouper atop a lobster frisee salad was tres bien.  The grouper was nicely seared on the outside, but the standout was the salad.  The peppery, delicately dressed frisee accompanied by tiny bits of lobster were a facile blend of textures and tastes-- crisp, tender, peppery, creamy.  Magnifique!

Dessert was a croissant bread pudding with dried cherries.  Quelle cerieses parfaites!  The bread pudding was soft, eggy and creamy.  The sweet/tart  cherries provided a nice counterpoint.

THE SERVICE:  Well informed staff.  Attentive, but not intrusive.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Malheureusement, this place will never get 5 stars from me because of their no reservations policy.  This is a tiny, charming popular place.  It is decorated like a dark little bistro with a large bar dominating the space.  However, no matter how charming the space, I do not like having to wait for a table for what could be an hour and a half or for twenty minutes based on the whim of my fellow diners and the popularity that night.  The food is good, but this policy seems like a game to increase the hype. I'm too old to remain so giddy at the prospect of getting a table that I will wait, spaniel-like, at the bar for however long it takes.

Despite the fact that the place was packed to le top last night, all the parties ahead of us were large, and there was one small table available, so we were seated within 15 minutes.  

The crowd is a mix of well off older couples-- very thin women in animal print tops and prominent jewelry and men with shining groomed hair-- and well off twentysomethings.  Everyone was respectful of the fact that their fellow diners were seated very close by.

Tres, tres bien all in all, with a few flaws."}
{"text":"Tartine has become our go-to Wednesday date night spot. On Wednesdays, all cocktails are $5! So, especially in the summer on their super cute patio, it makes for a lovely evening of drinking and chatting!

The food has always been outstanding -- from cheese plates to entrees. The ratatouille and cauliflower gratin are my favorite dishes. And the service has always been friendly and attentive.  The cocktails are always great, as well!

It's really nice to share a bottle of wine on the patio in the summer or to sit at the bar for happy hour! It's a versatile place --but kind of small, so come early!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Lakewood so I always thought Rocky River was dumb. I love this section of Rocky River by the bridge and the pink condos where Bernie Kosar used to live. A friend of mine jumped off the Detroit bridge to his death about a decade back so sometimes the bridge bums me out but like Led Zeppelin says \"I look to the west\" and avoid the memory trigger. Tartine Bistro is one of the best places to bring a date in my estimation. The interior colors are warm reds. The draft selection is mostly Belgian beers for around $6.50. The food ranges in price from around $10-$25. On Wednesdays they have live music."}
{"text":"Small intimate atmosphere. Great food! Good service. will definitely be back! 

Only thing I honestly did not like about it was the fact that they keep their utility room door open which is behind the bar so if you're sitting at the bar all you see is a basement full of cleaning supplies. whereas if that door were shut it would keep the warm cozy feel that I think they are going for.

Like I said I will be back and I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Succulent food, delightful atmosphere at a respectable price.  The owner is gracious and adds a touch of personal flare.  (Don't miss the cauliflower, or the filet mignon, or the roasted beet salad!)"}
{"text":"We went last night and sat up at the bar and had a great time!!  We were in town visiting family and weren't that familiar with the area.  We'd heard of a few places and popped into each.  None of them were very interesting.  Then we walked into Tartine and immediately liked the vibe.  It was cozy, with some chill lighting and lots of wood.  There were cool old looking chandeliers, and the old original tile on the ceiling that they painted red.  Dig it.  Cool how they kept a lot of the original structural integrity. The owner greeting us at the door made it feel that much more intimate. 

They have a really good menu - from a good cheese board selection, to a french onion soup with beef in the beef broth (!!!  SOOOO YUMMY.  Never experienced that before and it really gave some weight to the soup. awesome!), mussels, beet salads with pistachio's and goat cheese.  We also had sauteed ricotta gnocchi drizzled with balsamic glaze and little bits of bacon lardon.  WIth this one you have to have the complete bite or it doesn't work.  But when you do, it's really good. The pizza's looked excellent.  They had a small but well built entree section - sea bass and filet of beef, etc.  Overall, it was just enough variety yet the menu felt very cohesive.  lovely!

The wine menu was varied and interesting, but very accessible.  We loved the Sancerre and Tempranillo on the menu.  yum!! The Firehouse red blend and the Viognier were good too.  They also have a full bar which a lot of times you don't find with a heavily emphasized wine menu. 

What makes all of the above even better were the prices - they were incredibly reasonable. Esp. given the happy hour menu.  Super killer.  And it spanned from 5:30-9pm. 

It was a busy night and the crew handled things well.  The bartender/server Amanda had a great POV when asked and her suggestions were very good. We would definitely come back often if we lived here.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place to come to, especially if you want to make an impression. I came here for lunch and the place had a french bistro-esque feel to it. Service was nice and not overbearing and the food selection was fun and not your usual fare. I had a duck confit with brie and fig tartine and it came with a side salad. While a solid lunch (but the duck was a little dry), the food didn't make enough impression on me to warrant 4 stars. The taste was on the bland side and the portion was not enough to be filling, especially for the price tag. A place for ladies who lunch."}
{"text":"Recently, my hubs and I came her for a date night. We had a gift certificate so  it gave us a chance to try some things we normally wouldn't order. 

First of all, the atmosphere and the service at this place is top notch. 

We started with the chicken chorizo stuffed peppers. I was thrilled because I don't eat pork and these were just chicken! And they were delicious! Although, for this dish, the portion was sort of small. 
Then we each ordered a different dish & shared. We got the mushroom flatbread. Wow the flavors were so earthy and awesome. We also had the chicken tartine. Again,very flavorful. We had to order a tartine since that is wha the place is named after! Both main dish portions were generous. Way more generous than the appetizer course. We even had leftovers. 

We also each sampled some drinks. I had the fig cocktail, which was good, but a lot of the fig jam just sat at the bottom. I also had a different cocktail which I can't seem to remember which, but I did think it was good. Clearly since I can't remember which it was, it did the job.

I am so glad my husband and I tried this place! I read online about the Sunday dinner three course menu and we cannot wait to come back and try it. It's so nice to have an option with upscale food so close to home on the West side!"}
{"text":"date night! one of my very favorite places for lunch/dinner and/or cocktails. LOVE LOVE LOVE Tartine! Food, atmosphere, wine list, everything."}
