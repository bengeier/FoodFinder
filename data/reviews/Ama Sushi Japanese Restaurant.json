{"text":"Good food, sushi and everything is just as perect, I highly recommend this place, been working here for almost 2 years as a waiter. There is Dine-in, Take Out, Delivery, Catering and lots more. The food that is served are made fresh always"}
{"text":"The few times I've been here the sushi has been fresh. There is no all you can eat, but there are big portions and a very large menu with all sorts of combos. Highly recommended for any sushi lover in this area as there isn't much to choose from."}
{"text":"My family have been going to this restaurant for over a year now and we are never disappointed when we go. The food is always great fresh prepared very quickly never really have to wait the staff are friendly and the prices are reasonable for the area. I highly recommend this place it's great for sushi in the quiet little nook of Scarbrough and your guaranteed to have friendly service every time"}
{"text":"Wow, there has only been one other place so far that I wish I could have given a 0 out of 5 or a negative number if I could.  Ama sushi is so sad I don't even know where to begin.  We ordered one of their sashimi platters and they actually served us imitation crab meat and had the audacity to charge for it.  Their miso soup was straight out of a packet and the bad cd that played over and over again on giant speakers that were not safely secured over our heads just added to the ludicrously terrible experience.  I find restaurant owners (or chefs) that don't care about what they're serving to their customers extremely offensive.  Ama sushi is definitely one of those places.  I can't wait to see a better sushi place open up somewhere nearby."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie I use to dislike this place but they stepped up there game to the point where I was eating here at least once a week (I use to have a sushi addiction).

The atmosphere is very typical for a sushi place. Nothing special. Wouldn't take a date here or anything but it's alright to go with friends or family. 

The service for the most part was really good over the last year. I was bummed that when I changed my diet to a gluten free one they couldn't tell me if a bunch of there stuff had gluten in it. Big reason I no longer order from here.

The food was very tasty, alright price. They have a big menu with lots to choose from."}
