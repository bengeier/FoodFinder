{"text":"This place makes great sandwiches, this my new favorite sandwich place!  The sandwiches are ver meaty and flavorful with special sauces they add, they allow you to alter the sandwich to your liking,"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and my sandwich was delicious! I got the club. It was huge! The staff was friendly and the chef heckled me pleasantly. My only complaint is that my wheat hoagie was a little too hard for me to chew bc I have some weak, TMJ afflicted, jaw muscles. I'll definitely be back but I'll choose a softer bread :) The potato salad is also tasty!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly!  Hubbie had the Italian Hero and I had the Brutus...mine was roast beef piled high on lightly toasted wheat, lettuce, tomato, and horseradish sauce (tasted home made)! Very tasty indeed!  Neither of us cared for the macaroni salad but who cares?  We wanted to find a good sandwich near our home and succeeded in spades!  Will absolutely go again..."}
{"text":"got an everything bagel with scallion and bacon cream cheese.  Bagel was delicious and so was the creme cheese.  Only complaint not a thick enough portion of cream cheese.  Very thinly spread and was a bit disappointed for the cost."}
{"text":"Driving down Albemarle Rd and what should I see but a giant sign advertising NY Bagels. Now this is interesting - definitely not the part of town where you find bagels, ever since Brueggers left years ago, and those were not what most would call NY-style.  So even though it was supposed to snow and sleet and who knows what later in the day, I pulled into the lot (the one at the Firestone, as parking is a bit odd here) and checked it out. If you can get past the parking, the actual location is nice - a step up to the patio - not usable on this day - but a fair expanse inside.  The staff seemed a bit perplexed by a huge stack of supplies that just came in, but they were friendly enough. They fixed up an everything bagel on the grill, tossed in some Zapp's (I love Zapp's) and a dessert for later, and I was set.  Not as fast as you'll get in a NY deli, but about as close as you'll get in these parts - you can head to Poppy's or Poppy Seed's, but they are a good drive away, so it'll do in a pinch."}
