{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place on a Saturday afternoon. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was incredibly sweet and so attentive. She always checked in on us, and was genuinely interested in what we thought about the food. 

The food itself was fantastic. We ordered the ramen, pressed salmon sushi, rock on crispy, and the soufflé pancakes. Everything was incredible. We especially loved the pressed salmon and rock on crispy. Both were so flavourful, and the torched salmon was perfect. And of course, the soufflé pancakes were amazing. We added matcha ice cream on top and oh my goodness.. it was HEAVEN. Those pancakes were perfect. 

Overall our visit was spectacular. The food was great and the service was great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the west. Went here on a Friday night with a group of 13 people. The owner is very nice and accomdate our needs. Even tho the restaurant got busy later at night, the owner did not rush to give us our bills which a lot of smaller restaurant would do. The interior design is really nice! The environment was amazing which is not like any other izakaya where u can't really talk without screaming. The food are amazing with a mix of Japanese Canadian fusion. High recommended this place and I will definitely come back with bigger group."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. All the dishes we ordered were really good especially the Strip loin Tonkatsu ramen."}
{"text":"Craving some fresh sushi and in the Queen West area? This place is off the HOOK! 

Not only does this place offer fresh, high-quality sushi (see photo for mouth-watering sensations), as an izakaya (Japanese-style pub), it also serves tasty Japanese-style tapas and ramen that will certainly blow you out of the WATER! 

With a large group, we were able to try a greater variety of tasty delicacies, among them, a massive platter of incredibly fresh and sweet nigiri (see photo) featuring salmon, tuna, hamachi and melt-in-your-mouth uni. The nigiri was presented beautifully and was prepared with delicacy and skill by the chef/owner who came out to greet us with a warm welcome! 

For starters, we had some incredibly succulent oysters which were fresh and juicy along with well-seasoned edamame, meaty gyoza, crunchy fried chicken lollipops and refreshing poke nachos. The nachos stayed super crunchy and because it was paired with poke instead of cheesy toppings, this app felt light and refreshing which was great for a starter and was easy to share!

We also tried the Beef Maki Roll which was delicious and different from other rolls considering it was beefy but also savoury without being too saucy or overwhelming. You can actually throw a few of these back without feeling heavy which is nice. It's also cooked for those who don't like to eat raw fish/meat! 

Because I love crunchy textures, I really enjoyed the shrimp tempura which was crunchier than average as well as the Rock on Crispy which was even CRUNCHIER. Rock on Crispy features a deep-fried rock shrimp that's sauced up and garnished with salmon/tuna/tobiko on a bed of crispy fried rice ball which all sounds kind of complicated but it's really quite simple - it's tasty. 

For dessert, we had the FLUFFIEST, JIGGLIEST Japanese soufflé pancakes ever that are guarantee to make your heart flutter and your mouth water. Highly recommend! 

Overall, the presentation of all the items served were beautifully and meticulously arranged and the service was welcoming and attentive even for a large party. Good vibes all around at Sho Izakaya!

PRO TIPS: 
- Grab some Hitachino Nest Beer to go with your meal
- Option to order Sho Izakaya items from Foodora to enjoy from home!"}
{"text":"Friday 5pm for dinner. Quiet time, amazing food and service. The lady was very attentive, refilled our green tea, took away empty plates. The Poke Nachos, Salmon Tacos and Dynamite were the best. The ramen's soup was a bit too thin for us and the noodles were quite hard rather than chewy. However, my child loved it! The beef skewers didn't taste Japanese at all (tasted Middle Eastern)."}
{"text":"I went to Sho Izakaya for my first ever food Instagram meet. I met a couple of cool Instagrammers and we bonded over some delicious Japanese food. Sho Izakaya is a fairly new restaurant on Queen West that's quite low-key and provides a limited, but very affordable izakaya items! Since they are a newer establishment, they are still in the testing stages of the menu.

The restaurant was kind enough to let us try a couple of things that were not yet on the menu, including the Black Pepper Steak and Spicy Avocado Roll. My favourite dish would have to be the Wasabi Tako. It was my first time ever trying it, so I was excited to consume a lot of wasabi. The Black Bean Noodles were surprisingly a lot bigger than any of us expected. It was basically a full size bowl, which one could consume as an entree instead. There's currently only one ramen dish, which is the Pork Belly Ramen. So if you are looking for a variety of ramens, then I recommend checking elsewhere. However if you do order this bowl, it would be great to eat regardless. 

I highly recommend Sho Izakaya if you love izakayas but you can't afford places like Kinka Izakaya without crying over your bill. Sho is not only wallet-friendly but provides delicious food and Japanese-quality service. Plus, if you go now you don't have to worry about the craziness of lineups before it actually gets the recognition it deserves."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came as part of another food adventure borne of late night instagram surfing. Sho Izakaya is a small Japanese fusion shop way out in Parkdale. Decor is clean and simple, with basket weave light fixtures, vibrant street-style murals. My impression is that they are pretty understaffed/still working out the kinks as a relatively fresh restaurant. Our eager-to-please and apologetic server doubled as kitchen support and was extremely friendly---I hope they find someone to be dedicated front of house. We were informed that there were two menus; one regular base menu and one rotating special menu. I started things off with a bottle of Hitachino Nest Beer pale ale.

Based on the grams as well as upon recommendation, we decided to get salmon pressed sushi, some skewers, rock on crispy, mini seafood pizza, and beef maki roll. 

The salmon pressed sushi was my favourite. In contrast to the mayo-jalapeno-torched-to-medium-rare variant ubiquitous across GTA izakayas, the version here is only superficially torched (just enough for a light ripple of char), with much of it still fresh and raw and dressed with a citrusy yuzu mustard, tobiko, and microgreens. I daresay I enjoyed it more than those of Kinka's or JaBistro's but maybe I was just craving a change.

Of the skewers, the beef and the lamb were good, but largely unremarkable. The lychee bacon on the other hand was amazing. Sweet, savoury, smoky, chewy, juicy---delicious. This is a must order.

Rock on crispy is a slate of six pieces of fried rice ball, salmon and tuna tartare with aromatics, saucy fried rock shrimp, tobiko. Visually appealing, complex on paper, overbuilt in execution. I found many of the flavours lost in between the two deep fried components---texturally, too much of the same. It's an interesting twist on arancini but ultimately, it could use some re-balancing.

The mini seafood pizza was quite interesting! I'm not sure how exactly it fits within the genre of the menu but it is most certainly fusion. They leverage the flakiness of the scallion pancake (???) in place of the crust and top off with tomato sauce, cheese, shrimp, and some freshly chopped peppers and scallions. Maybe a touch expensive for the portion size but quite yummy.

The beef maki roll was nowhere to be found on any menu and I literally ordered off showing the instagram image to the server, to which he replied, \"O.K. I get that for you\". Essentially a mushroom and avocado maki topped with torched thinly sliced beef and microgreens and sauce. We also greatly enjoyed this and it was a nice change from having fish. My girlfriend especially so, as I turned for maybe a minute to shoot the other plates and her \"share\" of the roll was no more.

Sho Izakaya shows great promise as another interpretation of Japanese fusion/izakaya. I hope to see more drink options (perhaps a cocktail menu) and more of the chef's interesting out-of-the-box creations. Recommended."}
{"text":"I came to this place on a Tuesday evening with my boyfriend right at opening time. We were the only ppl at the restaurant at the time, and even though our reservation was at 6pm, the owner/server happily sat us down and explained their menu for us. The decor is chic and modern, with a huge painting of an architecture on one side of the wall. Theres also another mural at the back of a bench that features wings; when you sit there theres an illusion that wings are sprouting out of your back - how cool is that?!  

Theres 2 menus, one is their regular menu and the other a special menu that changes from time to time. After reviewing all our choices, we ordered seafood pizza, lamb, beef, and bacon-lychee skewers, rock on crispy, salmon boxed sushi, and beef maki. 

I have to say, I never knew bacon could taste so good. Ive never been a fan of bacon, and I seldomly eat pork, but man oh man the bacon wrapped lychee skewer blew my mind. The slight salty and charred bacon paired perfectly with the sweet lychee. I actually had to pause and recollect myself cause I wasn't expecting it to be so tasty. Other highlights include the boxed salmon sushi and beef maki. I loved how thick cut the salmon was on their box sushi. Flavouring was perfect with the sauce and greens at the top. The beef maki roll wasnt on the menu, but when my boyfriend asked if they could make it (and showed them an instagram pic of the roll), the server/owner said \"yes I can do that. No problem, we might have to alter the center slightly - no fries, so we'll put mushroom in\". That willingness to accommodate us just earned my respect for the owner. 

Service definitely deserves a 5*, the only reason I rated this as a 4 is because it was slightly more expensive than I thought. As well, some of the dishes we ordered I didn't fully enjoy. The rock on crispy looked and sounded delicious, but turned out to be meh. I particularly didn't enjoy the fried rice patty at the bottom - it was crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside.

Overall I enjoyed my visit, would definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It seems as if, in the last decade or so, Japanese food has become ubiquitous in Toronto. Case in point: we can even pick up a pack of pre-made (so-called) sushi in a supermarket. Yet, truly a good Japanese eatery remains a rare find.

Sho is a small, family-run Japanese izakaya. The word \"unassuming\" comes to mind. The decor is charming and lively; not traditional or opulent or stylish like some upscale sushi bars. However, its food is sensational! I'd say it was one of the best izakaya food we've ever tasted in Toronto.

This restaurant deeply cares about the quality of food they serve. The chef and kitchen staff take time and pay great attention to details. Their service prompt, attentive and friendly. Their sake & Japanese beer menu is small but offers quality. The regular menu is supplemented with a daily special menu and dessert menu, which makes the food selection wider and more exciting than most izakayas in town.

Anyone who has been to Japan and enjoyed good-quality authentic Japanese cuisine would agree that good Japanese food doesn't have to be expensive (unless it's very \"special food\" like kaiseki), but being able to serve genuinely good Japanese food at reasonable price here in Toronto is not easy, probably due to the high costs of the fresh and quality ingredients it requires. Sho seems to accomplish this not-so-easy feat somehow. 

If you're a Japanese food fan and can't afford to pay hundreds of $ for each meal, you owe it to yourself to try this surprisingly delightful izakaya."}
{"text":"If I could give an extra star for service, I would :)
Every dish was elegantly made and the servers were very attentive in asking for our preferences and our take on our order.

Souffle pancake is a must to finish the meal!"}
{"text":"Sho is a new restaurant in the Queen street West area, we had the four course chef special dinner, it was delicious. One of my favorite dish was the pork bone soup wrapped in sea bream pocket.. it wrapped the pork bone soup concentrates in sea bream fillet, it is like the soup dumping in dim sum, but replacing the dumping skin with the sea bream fillet. This was so delicious. The main course was wagyu beef with black garlic sauce, it was made to perfection. You need to book 48 hours ahead of time for the chef special dinner. We enjoyed it very much, the waiting staff is friendly and knowledgeable on what they are serving."}
