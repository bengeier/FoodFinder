{"text":"We have lived near the Arboretum for a long time and finally decided to give them a try.  I had picked up a menu on a previous visit to the Arboretum and called to place an order for take out.  We ordered typical southern fare of chicken fried chicken, corn, mac 'n cheese, potatoes, salad and cornbread.  I have to say, I was more than disappointed.  When I opened our food when we got home, the chicken was just a plain, slightly floured breast with some plain brown gravy on it.  There were 2 small new potatoes and the other sides were in small cups that weren't any bigger than what you might put salad dressing in (and they forgot that for the salad they included that was only plain lettuce).  Really?  I called to discuss the meals and the manager told me the portions were bigger in the take out than in the dining room (again, really?) and that I didn't know what typical southern food should look and taste like (I'm a North Carolina native).  He told me he might get one complaint a year.  Unfortunately, this year it was mine.  Overall, I cannot recommend this establishment.  Not withstanding the smallish portions, the food was not seasoned very well, if at all.  The gravy was plain and very salty like it came from a ready mix package.  The food tasted like it looked, boring and bland.  A terrible value ($10 per person).  Sorry, Charlotte Cafe.  I really wanted to like you and was excited to give you a try, but I have to send you to sleep with the fishes and the menu to the recycle bin."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Went for breakfast at 10am. Was sat by one person and about 5 minutes later another waitress came over to wipe our table as it hadn't been done since the last people. Didn't ask us anything and when she was done wiping just turned around and walked away. Sat for 10 more minutes before yet another waitress came and asked what we would like to drink. We ordered 2 waters...nearly 10 minutes later, as she was running food to the table next to us came to our table and asked if we were ready to order. We asked could we please just have our water first? To which she disappeared into the kitchen and 5 minutes later we got up and left.  We went across the parking lot to La Peep where we were promptly sat, warmly greeted and enjoyed a lovely breakfast. And spent far less money as Charlotte Cafe's prices are ridiculously high. We won't return."}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review before, but last night's dinner at Charlotte Cafe was spectacularly bad, and deserves a bad review.  Service was truly horrible. The waitress was surly (PMS-ing?) and spent about 20 minutes kibitzing with a big table while our food congealed on the service line. That was when she hadn't disappeared altogether.  The food itself was bland and visually unappealing -- colorless, and as I said, the pale beige gravy had congealed and had a skin on it by the time it got to us. My blackeyed peas were a dry lump and under-done, my sister-in-law's cabbage was cold as a frog, my chopped steak was gristly. It took an hour and a half from the time we were seated until the time we left, and we were the next to last table to leave. They were practically sweeping under our feet as we walked out. Overall, blecchh!  Oh, and to add to the misery, the live music was loud and intrusive."}
{"text":"Had a good little breakfast for under $6.00. Simple decor friendly staff."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their diner-like appearance.  The menu provides way too many options, which may seem appealing, but there seem to be too many choices for the cooks to keep up with.  The food not only looks disgusting, but tastes the same as well.  And if you are looking for horrible service from the time you walk in the door to when waited on, this is the place for you.  The servers treat you terribly, they all act as if they'd rather hang out and chat than wait on their customers.  And don't dare ask them any questions, as you'll get attitude from every single one of them.  Do yourself a favor and visit one of the many other restaurants at the Arboretum.  I promise, you'll regret eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is very inconsistent .   Have gone three times , first time it was good the following it was worse and worse.   Seems overpriced .... Suspect it only survives as the overflow for la Pepe ."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place two stars due to the fact the food was at least warm and brought at a decent time after ordering. We have been to this location several times and it actually went on our \"no fly list\" temporarily but we came back today to see if things have changed and they haven't. It is now on the list permanently.   We have always had an issue with service. I can understand that the regulars that go every weekend are important. However, that doesn't mean you ignore your other tables as you chit chat about life with them. Today we had someone get seated after us and they were greeted and drink orders were received and completed before we ever had our server even come up to the table. Our server was just short of being downright rude when she finally did come by. And when something was said about how cold it was, she mentioned it was because we were by the door. When we pointed out that everyone in the entire restaurant was bundled in their jackets as well as we were in the middle of the restaurant, she just \"assured us the heat was on.\" Basically she informed us that she couldn't give a sh*t. We ended up looking around and found the thermostat. It was right at the kitchen. I don't think you can adequately heat the dining room when you are relying on the heat coming off the kitchen.   With all that happened today as well as bad service and food we have received in the past, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"So, I actually really like this place. However, I can not stand the tvs!  I do not like dinning and having to see the news where \"so and so got shot a million times\" while I'm trying to hear about my sons day. Sure it's important news that a cop may have committed a crime and is being investigated but, I'm out at an establishment trying to enjoy a moment with my son and having to contend with a TV. Not to mention I've always felt that Charlotte Cafe was a Family restaurant, there are children in hear like my 7 year old who is now asking me questions like \"what are they showing that mans body parts with bullet holes in him\".  Bad form Charlotte Cafe!  If you're going have to TVs you must be responsible for the content you show! And by the way, I liked it better when you did not have them."}
{"text":"The food here is always good and I have never had poor service. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because they make you feel rushed and uncomfortable if you come in within an hour of closing. They start putting chairs on the table, sweeping and moping, etc. I came in 45 minutes before closing and the waitress suggested we hurry with our order before they put the food away. I used to wait tables and we would never let the customer feel rushed or uncomfortable if they came in during the last hour."}
{"text":"Rough start for lunch. Waitress with an attitude."}
{"text":"What a cool place to experience unique Southern flair!  I came here for breakfast and found it to be an experience unlike any other.  The decor takes you back into a different time and place.  Not that this is an old fashioned type restaurant, but it does possess a unique aesthetic that I haven't seen previously.   The food is unique as well.  While it doesn't lack the basic breakfast staples and go to Southern meals, it does offer some unique creations.  I ordered the Sly Scottie, which was a flagship dish of the cafe.  It was okay...not outstanding.  It had more novelty value that impeccable taste.  I wasn't impressed with the price.  I only had a lunch entree and a coffee, yet still spent about $16 with tip...quite a bit more than a reason lunch in my book.  I probably wouldn't frequent the Charlotte Cafe, but it's worth going to once."}
{"text":"A step above waffle or huddle house, with more local favorites than what you would find in a corporate chain. All the meals seemed to exceed expectations and where worth every penny.   If you are a fan of diners, this is a great spot for Breakfast."}
{"text":"This place specializes in down home cooking.  They are famous for their fried chicken and I definitely recommend trying it.  They also have a variety of other foods to choose from if you're more health conscious that myself.  Definitely one to try for your next long lunch hour."}
{"text":"We were shopping in the Arboretum area and were looking for someplace different to have lunch.  We spotted the Charlotte Cafe in the back of the plaza and decided to give it a try.    Walking into the restaurant, one notices that the decor is pretty simple; there is no particular theme other than the colors of black and white intermixed.  The checkered floor and four or five counterstools are reminiscent of an old-fashioned 50s diner, but that's as far as that theming goes.    We were a bit surprised to find that -- even during the week -- there was no lunch menu or pricing.  Meals were around $10 each, including sandwiches.  I ordered the gyro.  It came with one of about 20 side item selections.  Wow.  I was boring, though, and went with the traditional french fries.  I made a good choice, though.  They were piping hot steak fries.  YUM.  And the gyro was very meaty and delicious, too, for it not being a Greek restaurant.    My partner ordered their turkey dinner special.  It was basically the components of a Thanksgiving dinner with each item piled on top of another in a small casserole dish (even cranberries!) and then covered in hollandaise sauce.  He said it was good, but he wouldn't order it again.  I tried a bite, and the turkey was good (and thick) but I probably wouldn't get it either.  (I loved my gyro, though!)  The service was excellent and I'd recommend the Charlotte Cafe, but not for a cheap lunch.  Be prepared to pay dinner prices."}
{"text":"This is a throw back diner. Very popular with old people, does a big carry out business. The sly Scottie and open faced roast beef sandwich are difficult to find anywhere else. If I'm not interested in a heavy meal the vegetable plate with corn bread is great. I prefer the park road shopping center location to this one- seems more consistent."}
{"text":"Suckiest, most expensive crap I've ever been seen/eating. Smells like a bathroom, the menu is so large they can't work on the quality of the food. The menus have grossness on them. Waited for what felt like a few weeks for the food to get out. The tears that my stomach shed during digestion have me ulcers."}
{"text":"This was my first visit there I wanted a kids meal since I'm not a big I ordered a perch kids meal the lady at the register said they have a kids meal like that ok now the other lady tell me they can't do that then she show me the menu I said go ask your manager can they do it like he told her how to ring it up  and then my food get here I can smell how bad that fish was I just can't believe they would serve me got me fork took a little piece a bit a tiny bit it was fishy and it smelled bad so I got the waitress and told her this fish smell bad so she took my plate and made another she said sorry that fish I had was bad and no good I'm thinking to myself why y'all wanted to sell it to me I didn't even finished the one they over for me I threw it away I won't come back no more"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of breakfast & brunch, so I am always on the lookout for new options.  One Sunday, I decided to check this place out instead of going to my usual brunch place.  Sad to say, this was a big mistake.  For me, they did not have a good breakfast/brunch menu.. the offerings were very limited in comparison to other area brunch spots. But, I found something that sounded ok, and placed my order.    Unfortunately, the service was very slow and I waited forever for my food to come out - and it was not even anything special - scrambled eggs, home-fries, and toast.  Even worse than the slow service, was the fact that my food was cold and flavorless.   The price point was not bad, but I will not be back because I was not at all happy with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Cute little diner-like restaurant in the arboretum with FREE WIFI if you ask for it :)   Doing some work while waiting for my engine oil to be changed at Firestone!"}
{"text":"My family loves going here.  Kids get 2 sides for free and then we usually split a kids meal between them. My husband and I love when they have the pot roast over egg noodles special! They have lots of other great plates, too. The servers are always friendly and the place is always clean. Very family friendly if you're looking for a simple home cooked experience."}
{"text":"I typically end up at this popular local diner for either breakfast or lunch about once a year at the invitation of a friend. It is located amongst a cluster of small, independently run restaurants in one of South Charlotte's most popular and crowded shopping centers. For what it matters, its clientele seems to be comprised mainly of faithful regulars who appear to be in their 60s or older.   Although I really want to like this place, I have yet to find any aspect of it to be anything but slightly above average, whether it be the food, the service, or the atmosphere. My breakfast consisted of two eggs cooked over easy, with bacon, hash browns and toast. With coffee it ran around $9. Again, everything was okay but it did take about 10 minutes for our food to arrive at a time in which the restaurant was not very busy. Service was friendly and coffee was regularly topped off so I have no real complaints, but again it was nothing to write home about.  There are just so many options in the area that I prefer, however this place is still worth a try based on the fact that so many people enjoy it. I'm sure that I will try it again too, within the next year."}
{"text":"We come to the Charlotte Cafe periodically primarily because they have a good variety of veggies on the menu.  The food is, like I said above, a-ok.  You won't write home about it,  but we find it to be just fine. It's like diner food to me.    Tonight, I had the pork chop, and I've had it before.  It was good, tender, and cooked properly.  I had the collard greens and they were just fine!  Not full of stems like some I've encountered.  This is an \"easy\" place to go.  Easy to go with kids; easy to take your elderly mom.  Just easy, and not pretentious at all.  I see that others have complained about the service, but that's not what we have encountered here at all.  Maybe we hit the \"good\" days, but the wait staff has always been friendly, accommodating, and our service has consistently been good.  So, if you're looking for a unique, perhaps romantic, fine-dining experience... go across the parking lot.  But if you want a good meal, at a fair price, with several options to choose from, and in a relaxed  atmosphere - try the Charlotte Cafe."}
{"text":"Pathetic, no other way to describe this brunch. I did have breakfast here once before and it wasn't this bad. Feel my pain:   .....I get there on Sunday at 1:30pm after the rush was over. Their house special \"Eggs Benny\" covers the whole front of the menu. I order that with a cup of black coffee. I get the coffee then my waitress disappears until 20 minutes later when she brings me my plate. I stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious. Sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled. \"Is that too cooked for you?\" YES.  I wait and I wait and I wait ( just a few customers in the house) and a whole 15 minutes later she quickly drops off the new plate and runs off, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. It's been 35 minutes since I first ordered.   One egg is borderline ok, the other is hard boiled again, the Hollandaise is dry and starting to curdle, the English muffins are not toasted properly and they're chewy as hell, the hash browns are absolutely tasteless. Not a micro-gram of salt, pepper, paprika, onions nothing to give it any flavor.   No waitress anywhere, not only mine but all the ladies wearing black tee-shirts are anywhere but in the dining room. After a few more minutes I lose patience, go to the counter find a waitress and ask her for my check.  The girl at the cash register asks me how was my meal and I tell her exactly how it went.... in detail. She is very very very sorry but doesn't offer to comp even the coffee. For maybe only the second or third time in my whole life I don't leave a tip.   The worst Eggs Benny I've ever had, coupled with ridiculously bad service: $15 and some change including a cup of coffee. That's right, over FIFTEEN DOLLARS for this.  edit: check out the review that was filtered, I don't see why it was.  It reports a very similar experience to the one I had with the kitchen unable to cook the food right and the customer still being charged for it."}
{"text":"Great egg salad sandwich, seafood, sandwiches, Italian, banana pudding, meat and potatoes. Excellent selection of homemade vegetables. Friendly service. Nice location."}
{"text":"It's a shame... Came for breakfast and the food was pretty good. However, the staff was more interested in their conversation than in the customers.  My son had the sausage and gravy and it was delicious.  The portions are generous and prices are very reasonable. However, you can't get around that service and cold food. So sad"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch and had 3 eggs, 2 over cooked sausage patties, about a ¼ cup of grits, a pancake and sweet tea. Total came to $15.10...even higher with tip factored in. This is absolutely ridiculous! I am not one to complain and I am not looking for compensation or a handout; just voicing my opinion.  I could've went to many other places for this price and had much better food at this price point. I WILL NOT be a return customer. Way overpriced."}
{"text":"Went to this place for breakfast for lunch with my sister. It was fast friendly service and they were quick to refill my sweet tea and awkward requests (I mix and match slides).   My sister ordered pancakes which she had no problem with and returning to the South, the bowl of grits were delightful."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with family visiting from out of town. We all ordered the breakfast combination 4 and all got food poisoning. Plus, past experiences have also been less than desirable. Slow service, cold food, poor attitudes from servers.   Last time I went to the Charlotte Cafe, I met my real estate agent and attorney to close on my house. We seated ourselves outside per the instructions on the sign. The host came out and said only paying customers can sit there. It was our intention to get coffees while signing the paperwork so we told her and placed the order. We were there for a hour and were never offered refills or a menu."}
{"text":"From my one and only visit today so far, I rate this restaurant poorly because it took the server a long time to come to my table after I was seated. I ordered something on the menu called Sly Scottie because next to it in italics it said 'We're famous for this one!' It sounded okay: Turkey, broccoli, and cranberry sauce on top of a muffin (they mean English muffin). But when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard. It also felt like I was eating a bowl of lard. I should have probably ordered from the diet menu. Haven't had this bad of an experience in a while."}
{"text":"The hostess was sullen, unhelpful and generally a real downer! We came in to the restaurant and she was sitting in the very back booth talking with another person and made no attempt to greet us! So I grabbed menus and started to head to the table we wanted, and she made it very clear she was unhappy that we tried to seat ourselves!  The hostess is the first impression of the service, and mood, and the mood was ugly!"}
{"text":"Very good. I had the salmon pattie entree. Food and service excellent.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice service was fast and the breakfast is so yummy. Best French toast and bacon ! I will be back"}
{"text":"Had heard this place was really good so I went on Sunday 3/19/17 for breakfast with a Groupon coupon. The place was packed, we waited for about 5 min to be seated which was quick but we got in just before the Big crowds arrived, soon the wait time went to 30 minutes which is typical for a restaurant on Sunday @11am in Charlotte. We waited for what seemed like forever at our table which is better than standing waiting to be seated but it seemed like maybe they were understaffed? No worries we had a table...eventually the waitress showed up, took our drink order then disappeared. When she returned we presented the coupon and she disappeared again explaining she didn't know how the procedure worked? After several minutes, she came back and said all is ok they will deal with it when you check out, we ordered our breakfast. About 20 minutes later she brought out the food and I was Hungry, I could eat a Horse! Everything looked fine until the first bite and I instantly knew we had a problem....the food was barely warm. Looking for steam off my Hash and eggs I saw none and the butter on my guests pancakes wasn't melting.....Not good. No big deal, these things happen, seen it before....Obviously the waitress got behind with having too many tables to cover. So I politely brought it to her attention, she apologised and took the plate away, my guest said hers was edible she didn't want to wait all over again. I kept myself busy with the iphone for about 12 minutes when my order came back. This time it was fresh and very Hot, was it perfect ?  Well not quite, the amount of food was downsized, the plate was a much smaller size looked like a child's order and the rye toast they brought out wasn't warm enough to melt the butter.....I ate the meal and left the toast. When I checked out at the cashier, of course they always ask, \"how was your meal\" I said that it was clearly not worth the $13 they were charging even with a coupon and that I wasn't sure I would be back.....she ignored me and gave me a receipt. I still have one more groupon coupon to use there before June 11 for Breakfast only.......I think I'll give it away......$26 for a basic breakfast for two is too expensive with or without a coupon...I think Johnathans @ $4.95 is a great deal and I will go there from now on."}
{"text":"Our family of 5 used to frequent this establishment often.  NOT ANYMORE.  The last few times we have been there the service has been slow and the food mediocre at best but tonight we had the pleasure of watching 3 separate tables be seated after us, receive and eat and their food, pay their bill and leave while we waited and waited and waited until finally, after 45 minutes, we left.  One of the tables appeared to be the owner, so it is apparent that he does not put the customers first or 2nd or 3rd since each person that joined his table was also served while we continued to wait."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Be sure and ask for their specials. Two eggs, protein, hash browns, toast and coffee about $6.50. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Meh? Miserable unhappy staff.  Food sat in the window to die right in front of our faces for over 20 minutes.  Service was fast.  Prices were way overpriced.  Stomach ache afterwards.  It was adequate I guess but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"One of the most popular things to do in Charlotte or anywhere is to go out for breakfast on Sundays! So we thought we'd try this place. We arrived at 1145 am only to see they stop serving breakfast at 1130.... The menu says breakfast served til 2pm mon- sat????? Sorry but why would you serve breakfast til 2 pm thru the week the on the most popular breakfast day of the week you stop at 1130!?!?!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are so low for this place because it deserves a higher score.  I have visited this place twice in different times and the quality of the food is always great.  Recently I order the flounder with Mac and cheese and mash potatoes (Mac and cheese is not in the menu but it's there) and the fish was big,  fresh,  well cooked and delicious.  Plus,  my two sides were equally great and it wasn't greasy at all.  Although a little steep in price, I have to say it was actually worth it.  Plus the staff is friendly and very helpful as well.  Highly recommendable place for some great food in the area and with a big menu of many choosings, don't let the score fool you it is a good place"}
{"text":"Southern as in Southern European, not Dixie.   Menu skews toward Greek and Italian dishes.  Simple furnishings, no pretense of being high end.  Food was all institutional quality - vaguely flavored gravy, corn poured from a #10 can, \"buttery vegetable spread\" instead of butter.  Roll was warm and good quality which made up for it.  Elderly woman after me was talking quietly to the hostess about the chicken.  Based on other reviews, it may be worth avoiding."}
{"text":"I don't often get down to the Arboretum area, but we were over that way one morning and decided to stop for a bite at the Charlotte Cafe as a change of pace.  It's an interesting little place - nothing too pretentious (like Le Peep can be), just a little cafe that has a diner feel to it.  You have a decent choice of menu options, and most of them are pretty good-sized for the price.  While not the cheapest place in town, you do get a good amount of food, and we found that the staff was very friendly, and the always kept the drinks filled - something that is tough to find these days (and something that I'm always picky about)!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. I'm all about supporting a local, small business, as I work for one in the same shopping center, but this establishment is ridiculous. I like to eat pretty healthy, so typically I order the 3 vegetable plate. For around $7, you get 3 sauce containers (not embellishing at all) of vegetables. While it's pretty hard to mess up cottage cheese, black eyed peas, cucumber salad, and a few nibbles of cornbread, this leaves a lot to be desired. Today, I got the \"tuna salad\", and for $9, I received 1 ice cream scoop of the mixture with 2 tomato slices and 4 pickles. Do yourself a favor and enjoy Portifinos or Le Peep."}
{"text":"Good place for casual family dining, especially if you have little ones. They have a large menu and daily specials (recommend the chicken and dumplings). I've tried all sorts of things on their menu and the only item I recommend skipping are the fries."}
{"text":"I tried Charlotte Cafe for the first time today. I had a hotdog and mac and cheese for $5.25. The hot dog was ok, but the baked mac and cheese was delicious. It reminded me of K and W's mac. Waitress was nice, and I like the decor.   I recommend it for anyone wanting a country meal. Most prices seem a little high to me."}
{"text":"Really great service from the friendly staff... However, the food is quite bland. I hate to say it, but, it reminds me of the food they would serve when I volunteered at a nursing home... Sorry! The kids I take seem to like the spaghetti."}
{"text":"Cute little diner in the Arboretum Plaza where I stopped for breakfast while my car was worked on. It was perfectly adequate. Nothing spectacular, just A-OK.  Cheese omelet was a good portion, hash browns were huge but a greasier than usual and the toast was only warm when it was on the plate.  Spendy for breakfast."}
{"text":"The staff is so unfriendly and literally throws the order on the table.  The last two times I have been there the server did not return to the table for drink refills.    A check was never brought to the table and no one was at cash register.    NO MORE FOR ME.    Too many other choices at the Arboretum.  Lyn"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed dinner here. Good Southern sides and quick service. Nothing exceptional but a solid meal.   BUT after trying their breakfast, I have to post a review. It was awful and way overpriced. My ham and cheese omelet practically oozed American cheese, way too much so that it overpowered the entire omelet. The home fries had a not delightful seasoning, weren't fully cooked and were cold. The toast was dry and service was poor. The entire staff seemed overwhelmed and the kitchen was slow. Don't waste your money here."}
