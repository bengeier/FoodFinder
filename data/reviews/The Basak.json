{"text":"I was very into this store, I even ordered 250 $ of fried chicken here for my birthday party. But today my friends go there and ordered sweet and sour chicken, the owner made spicy fried chicken, so they ask for a change. The owner just refuse they made a mistake and keep saying this is what they ordered. I understand that they don't want to waste money to make another dish, but the service attitude is really disappointing. Will not go there anymore. Plus, the portion is pretty small, and taste not that good. I suggest Mon Ami and Dawa, they might be a little far, but the portion is much bigger."}
{"text":"The spicy wings there's are amazing best I've had in a long time. Great service and there establishment is very clean and pleasing to enter."}
{"text":"The best. It's cute and modern and the staff is friendly and quick and their food is soooooo good"}
{"text":"I went there 3 times already. Last time was the best.  After a heavy badminton day, I was hungry for Fried chicken.  We order half chicken, large chicken wings and sapporo.  Chicken is juicy and crispy. I love their chicken wings. delicous. crispy.  They gave daikon cube as side dish which was great. What amaze me was the table calling button and great Kpop song on 2 huge screens.  Beer and fried chicken feels great.  On the other hand, their patbingsu is awful. It's horrible. It felt like some cheap shaved ass topped with red beans and candies. Nothing compare to other patbingsu I had before. They should many focus on chicken and alcohol. Being the only Korean Fried chicken place in downtown Montreal is a strong advantage.  The owner is super gentle. Good service. He enjoys his job. That's for sure. Overall good experience.  Kpop music, Korean Fried Chicken in Downtown. Good place."}
{"text":"The soy garlic chicken was very good. The original was a bit dry and needed some more seasoning. The food was also somewhat expensive. Overall, it was a very yummy meal."}
{"text":"I have always been an avid fried chicken lover, so I knew I had to check this place out!  Their interior is pretty simple but nice, with Kpop playing in the background. I went with 2 friends, and we ordered fried chicken (obviously) - and chose the half marinated, half soy garlic boneless option, and also ordered a side of mozzarella sticks. I really enjoyed the soy garlic chicken, and I love how the chicken wasn't overfried. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good as well, but I didn't think that 6 sticks were worth 5 dollars ):   They are a bit limited in other food options, but I think they serve the best Korean fried chicken in downtown montreal!"}
{"text":"Average food, way tooooo expensive, they gave a lil finger sized drumstick and 7-8 pieces chicken bites  for 14 dollars. And the chicken bites were dry as hell. Way too overpriced for mediocre food. Nothing fancy, i'll still choose kfc over this crazy expensive mediocre place. Don't waste your money. I'd have given it zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing that I actually was inclined to write a review on yelp.  I took my girfriend there for dinner after seeing some pictures from Instagram of Basak and to get to the point: we loved everything about it. We ordered the half and half with classic and spicy chicken. The spicy chicken was super flavourful and the classic was lightly salted. They were just fried so the skin was just the right amount of crispy and the chicken was super tender. We had some beer and rice to accompany the meal and it was an absolute delight. Definitely the best friend chicken I have ever tried so far in Montreal (sorry Poulet Bronze)."}
{"text":"Toujours contente de trouver un restaurant ouvert tard. Ça c'est top! L'ambiance \"corean pop\" est super cool. Ma petite sélection: choix de salade de mais et laitue, choix de boulettes de poulet pané aux sésames en sauce barcecue épicée + des rouleaux de pâtes et patate douce frits. C'est assez curieux mais j'aime assez !"}
{"text":"Résumé : 17$ pour 10 ailes de poulets à l'ail et soya pour emporter, soit 1,70$ par aile. Les ailes sont bonnes, avec un bon ratio poulet/friture. J'ai aimé le daikon mariné qui venait avec pour diluer le goût trop sucré et salé de la sauce. Trop cher pour ce que c'est.    Service: Considérant que des commentaires indiquaient que le service était lent, j'ai commandé d'avance pour emporter. La serveuse ne comprenait pas le français et m'a demandé de commander en anglais. Ce qui n'est pas étonnant pour le quartier, mais quand même décevant.   Nourriture: J'ai aimé les ailes de poulet. Un peu trop sucré, ce qui peut tomber sur le cur à la longue, mais le daikon (radis) mariné permet de changer le goût entre deux bouchées. Le poulet était bien croustillant et goûtait bon, mais ne vaut pas le prix demandé.   Prix:  À ce prix, on peut se permettre de bien meilleur repas dans le coin.   Ambiance: Il y a des places assises, mais c'est un petit restaurant. Ambiance pour jeunes universitaires ou famille plutôt que pour un souper romantique. Il y a une tv avec musique coréenne."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  My friends and I affectionately refer to it as \"le Ballsack\", but don't let that put you off, we're silly and this place really is excellent.  From the 60's retro styling to the psychedelic, epilepsy inducing k pop playing on TV, Basak effervesces Koreanness.  No detail is spared, you'll notice there's electronic bells on each table, a staple of restaurant dining in South Korea and Japan.  The fried chicken is solid. Tasty and not too salty. The spicy fried chicken is mixed with some kinda delicious mochi that's coated with delicious spicy sauce. It's excellent.  You must try the cheese corn. It's cheap and delicious, it also goes really well with fried chicken.  Verdict:  Second best Korean fried chicken in Montreal. Best I've had in the downtown core. Try it."}
{"text":"We ordered the marinated chicken (yang nyum chicken) with chicken and green onions (pa-dak) via phone. The lady I spoke to was very calm and was very sweet sounding. She told us it would take 30 minutes to arrive. Usually it takes about 50 minutes according to my brother so I was hopeful.  Nope.   I heard a knock about 15 minutes past an hour. Not impressed at all, I handed the guy the money from my wallet, and as I was reaching into my pocket to give him change for the complete 12% tip (btw, the lowest I tip is 10% for the slow/rude people), he looks at me and tells me \"uhh people usually tip 10%.\"   ...............  So I fished out the rest of the money, and even after I gave him a 12% tip, he left grudgingly. If you're an 45 minutes late from the expected time, and 30 minutes late from the usual time, and you didn't even bother calling us, you can't really expect a good tip... At least in my book.  With two cokes, minus the tip, the total was about $62, which is hella expensive. My brother and I finished it and were content, but we definitely could have made three times the amount with $30, marinade and all.  Overall, the place is good for cravings, but I certainly don't want to order from here often otherwise my wallet will be lighter and my conscience will be heavier."}
{"text":"this is a cool place! It's a nice Korean style fried chicken spot that serves some pretty damn near perfect fried chicken morsels that make you fall in love with chicken all over again. Their honey mustard is pretty awesome as well Something interesting is that there's a bell at the table that calls the server over to you, which felt weird doing. It's a good place to go to when you want a quick bite and do not want to spend tons of cash"}
{"text":"This place is not really far from where I live so I thought.. Let's give it a shot! Meh... I expected more from the reviews :-/ You get very small portions for the price ($28 for an Half n' Half, with nothing else than the fried chicken itself and a little side of white pickled radish...). The original fried chicken was too dry, but the spicy marinated fried chicken was excellent. Juicy and savoury, very spicy :)  The service was excellent though, even for a take out. The place is nice, simple and clean. But don't go for the quantity... Also, I liked that they ask if you want the bones or not. Hopefully you'll like it when u go!"}
{"text":"The service was really bad and disrespectful. Forcing the customers to order as per the need of their business was not an appreciable attitude."}
{"text":"It was great I had cheessy bread and large spicy chicken for 33$ The chicken was well seasonned but I expected more cheesy bread for 4.99 but the cheesy bread was crispy and tasted really good !"}
{"text":"Cool little spot for some Korean fried chicken and drinks. The Basak also has a cool little feature of a table side buzzer/button that allows you to buzz in a waiter to order more food or drinks.   Food was good, price is alright, boneless fried chicken was crispy, pickled daikon is always great, and the vegetable tempura that they served was something new to me. Potato, sweet potato, onions, green onions mixed into a patty and tempura fried was pretty good."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Second time because I didn't have a choice. Even though the Basak specializes in Korean fried chicken, it is the worse Korean fried chicken I've ever had. I'd rather spend the same amount of money for twice as much and better chicken at KFC, or get much better fried chicken at Chez Bong or Les Saisons de Corée two streets down. Their portions and the juiciness of the chicken was way below expectation. The flavour wasn't as bad, but doesn't compensate for the rest. The only reason why I'm giving a 3 stars is because of the atmosphere and the service. The place is very clean and a few screens are playing kpop videos. With so many other choices of Korean restaurants around, I would avoid it as much as I can."}
{"text":"Located downtown next to Concordia, The Basak is a small and cute Korean restaurant. It was interesting seeing that they had an electronic device that you could ring to call the waiter. However I do think that for a small size restaurant like this one, one should be able to communicate directly with the server with the wave of a hand or an eye contact.  Food does look good on picture, but it can get dull if you order only chicken. Don't get me wrong, the fried chicken is tasty and well cooked. We tried both the original and the garlic/soya sauce, both were very good, I recommend the combo plate with half of both. Price point is a little bit high for fried chicken, especially because it doesn't come with any sides. You can order either a half chicken or whole, with bones or without. I would suggest ordering a whole chicken and splitting it in 2-3, since the portions aren't that big. This is definitively a heavy meal, and I would've appreciated it if it came with a salad and rice (they probably have a plate like this for lunch, but they should make it available for diner as well). Rice has to be ordered separately, and there weren't much choice for healthy veggies on the menu. Funny thing that happened during my visit was that we were told that they sold out on rice! How does that even happen in an asian restaurant? I was quite surprised since it was around 7pm.  TLDR; somehow expensive, cute decor, dry meal, quick fix, slow service, share plates, eat your 8-9 portions of fruits/vegetables at home."}
{"text":"I want to be be impartial and totally unbiased, but if a place makes plain fried chicken wings and they are delicious enough to eat on their own, they are first rate in my book. However, if you love sticky, sweet, and salty chicken, then their soy garlic wings (and pieces) may just become addictive. All I need is some soy garlic wings, rice, and the included daikon cubes, and I'm a happy lady! I've had the kimari, which are nice, but are kind of one note. I have been meaning to try the cheese corn because those are two of my other favorite things, I can't imagine it would be bad.  A few things to note: it's not as fast as fast food (which is good because it's fresh) and it's at a higher price point (I think it's worth it but YMMV)."}
{"text":"The fried chicken itself is average at best.  There was a few issues I think is holding back the chicken from being really enjoyable. We got the half and half bone in hot sauce / soy garlic. The main issue is that for some reason they decided to cut up the breast and thigh pieces into bite sized pieces (this is something I wouldnt expect when asking for bone in). This is good for increasing breading to meat ratio and also potentially making it easier to eat, but ultimately the small pieces were dry and not very tasty. Other things like the exterior not being crispy, and the hot sauce being more sweet than spicy really lowered the experience.  The atmosphere is good and up to par with most western korean restaurants, but I just wish the chicken itself was better. I asked if they had non cut up chicken and they don't, which I think would help a lot."}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken, you'll like this place. Delicious, crispy Korean fried chicken that came out nice and hot and juicy, not dry at all. My family and I shared the special that includes a pitcher and 2 types of chicken - Original and Spicy. This feeds two people so we also ordered the medium size Soy Garlic boneless chicken. Would recommend ordering a large size or another medium order for a group of 4.   Glad we stumbled upon this restaurant during our Montreal visit!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre fried chicken but terrible service. I ordered the food for delivery and it took an hour and twenty minutes. Chicken was no longer crunchy and fresh by then. Owner had the audacity to call me and tell me to tip before I even received my food."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! If you love chicken, you'll love this place. Perfect Korean style chicken!! & Their fried kimmari was amazing too!! Woo!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get fried chicken in Montreal. They only really have a few flavours but they do them really well. The honey garlic is my favourite. On the pricier side but I think it's worth it because the chicken is good quality. It's usually pretty empty in here which is nice and peaceful, and I enjoy watching the Korean MVs in the background!"}
{"text":"Great chicken, terrible service. Waited more than an hour for delivery, had to call back many times to confirm if the deliveryman was on the way. When he arrived, very unprofessional. Did not know how much change to give, and was pulling it out of a wallet as if he was fumbling to give change to a homeless person. He even had the nerve to brashly ask me,  'So how much tip will you give me?' I gave him a tip so that I didn't have to deal with him anymore. Food was colder than the service."}
{"text":"I tried this place out after discovering it was so close to the hotel I was staying in. My group of three ordered take out - half fried and half spicy marinated chicken to share. First, for the price, I thought the portion size was on the small side. Given that the walk from the restaurant to the hotel was maybe five minutes, I expected the chicken to still be crisp. The fry batter was far from crispy - even for just the fried chicken. The spicy chicken was not spicy at all and the sauce overall tasted more like ketchup than anything else. I was looking forward to having some decent Korean fried chicken but was disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all, i have to say that their chicken taste good  ( with GARLIC and Soy Sauce)  But, me and my friend we both had a very bad stomach PAIN after eating their chicken ! My stomach pain started the moment i finished my dish , i wasnt sure if it was caused by the chicken, then my friend she told me she had stomach pain the whole night and that she threw out all the food.  i was 100% sure it was the chicken !!!    I hope the own can see my comment make inspection of their ingredient and kitchen sanitation! Like seriously !"}
{"text":"Bon restaurant  coréen ! Ambiance  fast-food. Plat assez épicés à mon goût  !  J'avais commandé comme une Kimari Tempura   qui était  savoureux . Mon plat principal  était  un poulet braisé épicé !"}
{"text":"I love korean fried chicken! This place has it down pretty well. My favorite is the bone in chicken with sweet and spicy sauce. Nice place to hang out with a few friends over chicken and beer. They also have TVs that are always plaging korean music videos"}
{"text":"If you are looking for KFC look no further, The Basak's Korean Fried Chicken is goooooooooooood. Less oily, less junky and less poisonous :D. It might be slightly pricier than KFC but at least my body doesn't reject it like it would a toxic KFC.  Do not order the boneless chicken...no one likes dry breast meat."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick fix of fried chicken, perfectly cooked, not greasy or overly salty."}
{"text":"The buldak chicken is AMAZING if you like spicy food. I also had the half and half boneless chicken (hot and garlic) and an order of sweet and sour chicken among some other odds and ends and everything was very good. the soju is definitely worth a try but its a bit strong to drink with dinner in my opinion. they have kpop videos playing on the TVs which is cool. the only thing I wish they had were some Korean beers and sodas. they do have a small handful of Korean drinks but nothing that is really refreshing enough to have with dinner. that is just my opinion though. the food seems very authentic to me although I have never been to korea, however all three times I have eaten here approximately half of the customers were Korean so I suppose that must mean something considering the amount of other Korean spots in the area that don't seem to have an abundance of Korean customers like this place does."}
{"text":"My God! What a trip! With Korean Pop videos playing on all flat screens, see-through plastic chairs and Korean Fried Chicken, what else do you need? I can see the pre-hockey game crowd coming here for beer and chicken wings but I think to just limit yourself and not trying out the different varieties of fried chicken (soy garlic, spicy), the tempura veggies then you might be missing out.  I think the craziest part is watching the Korean pop videos. That's a cultural experience in itself."}
{"text":"The owner is super nice and the fried chicken tastes really clean, simple and not too greasy, also the portions are good too but it is slightly pricey! Still, would go here again :) yum"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Its a nice little underground restaurant. Quiet, small and super clean. However, in the winter, it does get easily cold as soon as someone opens the door.  FOOD: The chicken is tasty. Honestly, I find that there are places that do it better though. Their sauce is too sticky for my liking, it was hard for me to talk to my friend because my mouth felt like it was glued. We got spicy and honey/garlic but they didn't taste THAT different from each other which was pretty disappointing. Also, a few of the wings were a little bit bloody on the bone which threw me off.  PRICE: Overpriced but it won't break your wallet. Dishes are small in sizes but are quite expensive for what it's worth. It's affordable, just not worth the price in my opinion.  SERVICE: The service was great. Even though there was a faulty wing, the chef took the time out to come explain to us the situation and offered us rice on the house. I also like that they have a button that you can press if ever you need service."}
{"text":"Thought this place was legit 4.5/5 until a friend (whose palate is sorta missing) told me it's great. So I became wary and decided to order less. Well, looking back, thank f*ck for that. I don't go about spending 20$+ at KFC, so why would I do so here?  Turns out, the speciality fried chicken is probably just a less oily version of pop corn chicken from Popeye's, or some sort of general tao chicken. But if you don't pay 14$ for half a plate of general tao chicken (24$ for a full plate), why do so here -- and, what's korean about it? We had the garlic and soya boneless fried chicken (tastes just like tao chicken), because the 2 other 'flavours' are 'classic' and 'spicy' -- very interesting choices hmm.  Anyway the other thing that reviewers raved about is the 'buldak', or in english, extra spicy chicken... Extra spicy turned out to be extra disappointing. Basically, it's a stir fry of chicken with onions, carrots, and daikons in a korean sauce (dry rub in water). Annnnd it wasn't barely spicy. Price-wise, it's 20$ for that average sized plate (refer to pictures below)... which is a good 150% the price of what it is worth.   Now some of you are saying 'well you haven't tried their chicken wings'. My answer: fk datttt. If the boneless chicken is already kinda dry, I don't want to think about how tough the wings are going to be when the heat finally cooks through the bones.   What I liked about this place though, is that bell you can ring for service, and they give 10% off for people with the MCSS card.  It was pretty spacious and K-pop videos are played on two TV screens.  The owners were pretty nice, but I figured that they'd better be extra nice, because what they're cashing in for their KFC rip off is quite a stunt (and definitely worth that 4.5/5). But as much as their food goes, it's a 2.5/5: no go."}
{"text":"I see a lot of mixed reviews about Basak I still ended up trying it was in the mode for fried chicken and not for KFC . It must of been one of the good days for me because I really enjoyed it . I had the popcorn chicken with there wings soy garlic they were cooked perfectly crispy and not to dry . They had this button at the table you press when you need the waitress for napkins more water or what ever it maybe . It did cost  a lot but still worth it to me baises off my experience I would come back ."}
