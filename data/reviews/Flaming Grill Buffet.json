{"text":"It's a buffet lol. That's all. It's not good, it's not bad.  The servers tho, very very very nice. Still doesn't make the food better lol. But hey, it's a buffet."}
{"text":"Food on Buffett was fresh. Will be back.  Service was good as well. Wide selection of food to choose from."}
{"text":"Formerly this restaurant was the Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet that closed unexpectedly in April 2017. So after misleading signs saying the restaurant was being renovated, what really seemed to happen was it was sold and bought by The Flaming Grill Buffet. The restaurant did get a minor makeover if you call it a makeover. I liked the old way better personally. They took down dividers so you are seated very close to nearby tables by complete strangers. Also they removed many booths so there are very few and mostly tables with chairs. They officially opened last Saturday.  Now to the food which was okay. The Hibachi Grill had a nice selection of raw veggies, beef, chicken, steak and shrimp. You pick out your selections then give it to the cook and he cooks it in front of you. The cook was very slow and had a big line waiting. He only cooked six people's food at a time wasting a huge amount of space on the grill. The former Hibachi Grill chef had it down to a science. He would cook 10 to 15 people's food at a time and kept the line moving. So finally he asked what sauce I wanted. I chose brown sauce not even knowing what the hell that was. Other choices were soy and teriyaki sauce. When I got back to the table I was excited to dig in. I forgot the shrimp sauce that I like to add on the top. I went back to get it, they have a white and a shrimp sauce. Both were in a big squirt pump and disgusting. Looked and tasted like mayonnaise. The food itself was good but bland I'm sure because of the sauce. The former Hibachi had this awesome garlic sauce that really made the food pop.   They also have a big sushi bar that after two attempts remained mostly empty because the guy couldn't keep up. What I did try was just okay. Again I like to dip my sushi into shrimp sauce and theirs left a lot to be desired.   They have a large Chinese buffet variety and some American food as well. This food that I tried was pretty good but nothing to write home about. The wontons we're rubbery so that was a let down. Chicken on a stick had a funny flavor that I didn't care for. I enjoyed most of the items I tried though.  Dessert was another let down other than the fried Chinese donuts. Ice cream was little cups and bars that were boring. They have the normal selection of those little nasty cakes on the bar as well. They had a chocolate fountain with a few things you could dip into it. The chocolate wasn't even warm.   Now for the prices which was ridiculous for the food quality. $10.25 for adults and $6.99 for kids. Way more expensive than the former and no way near as good. The drinks were around $2 each. Our bill was $48 for 3 adults and 1 child.   Pretty sure we will not be back unless they make a lot of changes and drop their prices. Simply not worth it to me. I had very high expectations and was sadly very disappointed. Hoping the old Hibachi reopens somewhere."}
{"text":"The food has gotten a lot better since the re opening. My husband and I just got home, I can barely  move so full!!! My drink was a Mt. Dew and was gross!! Bubble water! But no worries! Replaced with water and finished our meal! The sushi ! Omg! Have Ell now! Wasn't to bad! My husband loved it lol. Its where we went for our first date 3 years ago! Thanks! For a great dinner for this momma and daddy date night!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is getting low reviews. All of the food is fresh, and the hibachi is delicious! The guy who cooked my ribeye cooked it to order (medium rare,) andseasoned it with Montreal steak seasoning. It was sooooo good! All of the other food was good too, and the table service was excellent! Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"This will be an honest assessment of this restaurant. I have been here when it was the Hibachi grill and now under the name of Flaming Grill and Buffet. So besides those comparisons, I am a well traveled foodie. It is my deepest hope that the new owners listen to the advice given by their customers.  Lets start with the grill part. So the yellow noodles need to be placed in same column with white rice because these are \"bases\" for your dish and this prevents vegetables/meats from being dropped in them.   Now the brown sauce. This sauce is very bland. If they would mix the brown and soy sauces together then it might be alright. Also the shrimp sauce leaves a lot to be desired.  The steak on the grill side needs to be trimmed before hand. Also the beef on the grill side needs to be trimmed before being sliced to thin pieces. The way it is now there is more cubes of just fat than beef.  The chicken on a stick is also bland and ranges from cooked nicely to brick hard. Try adding flavor to them and cooking them more evenly. The Terriyaki chicken on a stick is better than what you have and has a great flavor.  The other food on the buffet were more often cold than not. Then last but not least the desserts need to be scrapped and start new. I have tasted desserts from a Wal-Mart deli case better than what is offered here.  The restaurant is fairly clean and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Why did I listen to Sandra... who said to give it a try? It was awful. The food was cold, everything was old and loaded with sugar. Why make everything so sickening sweet?  And the lettuce on the skimpy salad bar was mixed in ice; who does that? Not that I usually eat salads at buffets, but I was reaching for anything at that point.  Don't give it a try. Sorry Sandra, but you were wrong about this one."}
{"text":"Im not sure about this place the people  was great the food was a mixed bag the lo mein  was bad that would seem easy but no the noodles are too fat and not fresh even when it just came out the kitchen no real crab  no crab legs the sushi chef is great most of the food was hard the soups were good  deserts were good too im glad i came alone my date would have been beaching lol"}
{"text":"Yeah, I mean, if you really are going to go to one these, you can't beat the price and the food selection. It's crazy on all the food they have here...dang. Hibachi grill, sushi bar, and everything else you could want...top it off with a chocolate fountain!!!!!! If you like to eat food...this is your place."}
