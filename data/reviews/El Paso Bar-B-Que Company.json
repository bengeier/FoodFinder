{"text":"i've only eaten here a couple times. i got brisket and pulled pork. both times each dish was dry. the portions were small. i didn't like the food much. prices were alright. the atmoshpere is nice and western themed. i know they have a happy hour in the bar with half off appetizers. i would recommend this but not the food. however, other people i know have gone here, and they love the food."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to some great BBQ, but I definitely wasn't expecting to get dry pulled pork from El Paso.  And when I say dry, I mean dry - like the Salt River, fools.  I had heard such good things about this place.  And to be fair, the rest of the food was really good.  It smells of smoked mesquite when you walk in and really does up that wooden western look throughout.  A big lunch group of us were seated near the center of the room next to a rad antique industrial-sized grill.   I thought the jalapeno cornbread was the standout item here, which along with the honey butter was a great complement to the kick-your-ass spicy/sweet BBQ sauce.  The steak fries (not too crispy and not too soft) and cowboy baked beans were surprisingly terrific as well.   The service was OK, it seemed the server was in a cranky mood for some reason -- but it wasn't horrible.   The pork though, was just really bad - stringy and overcooked.  Perhaps it was an isolated incident - but inexcusable still.  Had I had more time than my already short lunch hour I would have sent it back.  But consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"CLOSED  This El Paso is now closed.  I heard others have as well.  Too bad.  The catfish could feed a family of four and was actually pretty good.  As was the bbq sauce.  A little bummed to see it go."}
{"text":"It always seems like when you had something for along time you take it for granted , then it is taken away and you miss it. So it is with El Paso , I haven't always liked El Paso as much as the last two times I was there. The last two times great food and service.Great conversation with the Manager, then bam the doors are closed.  Talked to a friend in the know who had done charity events with them and he says that the chain has been hurting and the two AZ locations were the only two left. They say there is a small chance they may reopen but it doesn't look good.    Fair thee well El Paso , I barely knew you."}
{"text":"Many a year ago - I'm talking like 1998 - this place had delicious food.  However, the few times I've been there in the past, oh, 3 years, the food has been *awful*.  One time I didn't even get to the food because we walked out after waiting about 40 minutes without even having drink orders taken.  They changed their menu and took the delicious chicken dish off and replaced it with a lot more \"fancy\" type things, that they just don't prepare well.  I'd recommend yelping BBQ and finding a better place to eat!"}
{"text":"Sadly my fears have come true no more BBQ. :( El Paso went under."}
{"text":"One day while visiting some friends in Glendale we decided to have dinner at El Paso. I'm not a huge fan of BBQ, or meat in general, but not knowing the area we decided it would work. The strip mall and area are a little sketchy, but the restaurant was very nice. Our server and the food ,although not my style, was also good.   The only negative part of my experience was the way I saw an employee get treated by a manager. We saw a manager yelling at this waitress more than once near our table for no reason. All of the employees seemed to have a general fear of this woman, and it was very awkward and noticeable. My friends and I have all worked for restaurants and we were appalled. I will not be coming back to El Paso. Mainly because I don't enjoy BBQ, but also because our eating experience was ruined by a manager. How Ironic."}
{"text":"You know, I like this place. My friend Dave Sheehy sings there. It's comfortable, it's good. The food is pretty consistant and reasonable for what you get, some great drink specials and, did I mention, my friend Dave Sheehy performs there? Just a really great place to hangout, listen to some good music and be.  Check out the food and drink specials. El Paso has been really working to provide a good dining experience by changing things up every once in a while."}
{"text":"Does anyone know where I can buy a case of the Branding Iron BBQ Sauce they used to sell at El Paso BBQ? It was a family favorite & I miss it!"}
{"text":"During my trip to Glendale, Arizona, my friend and I decided to have dinner at El Paso. The bbq pork ribs were absolutely delicious. The ribs were very juicy and the sauce was just amazing =P. The plate came with two sides and the cream corn was my favorite! I ordered a strawberry lemonade which came in a fancy big cup. It was a great meal for a decent price, I was impressed!  They also offer military discount. I would definitely revisit the next time I'm in Glendale."}
