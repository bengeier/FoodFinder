{"text":"As my post food poisoning meal this was a bit of a disappointment. Bland bland bland is my only word of warning. I've had some great veggie pizza, and this was not it. 

Very over-onioned and sauce that was Raguish both in flavor and consistency. The dough was flat and boring, not really much of anything. While I know that as a vegetarian my pizza proclivities are somewhat limited, but there are ways to make anything taste great. Say spice for instance. 

Honestly while watching Chris eat his grease soaked slice I hardly found it appetizing.  Not to mention the paper plate that he could have wrung out at the end of the meal. Less is more, when it comes to the over greased mess that's for sure. 

Bottom line...not really what I would call a \"mom 'n pop shop\", honestly bring on the Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"Please be aware that this location has permenantly closed down since December 2013. It was a former Panzerotto Pizza chain renamed Gino's Pizza after the company rebranded itself in 2012. This location has been removed from the store locator map on Gino's website."}
{"text":"This was my first Panzerotto Pizza experience, and I have to say it wasn't bad at all!

We ordered a few pizzas for lunch, and while I was a little thrown off at first that the chicken was breaded and literally looked like chopped up chicken fingers put on a pizza, but it actually tasted pretty good. 
The only flaw aside from that is some people thought the crust was too thin and floppy, but the ratio of crust to toppings seemed pretty fair.

I'm not sure how many people read Yelp reviews before ordering pizza, but this place is A-OK either way! I can definitely see myself partaking in the Panzerotto brand again."}
{"text":"This former Panzerotto & Pizza 2 For 1 and their deluxe pizza's were a pretty good value and decent food, served quickly.  Now, unfortunately it is a Gino's and the pizza is horrible. Because it is so close by, I've actually tried three times and had equally doughy pizza with skimpy toppings.  I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Good pizza, nothing out of the ordinary.  I tried their new apple pie thing which was quite tasty.  Nice and hot fresh out of the oven."}
