{"text":"Word in the 'hood on this joint is that they've got a few negative karma points they need to live down. Something about stealing another establishment's menu and opening up a carbon copy of the object of their ... admiration.  Nonetheless I have been going here for the past 2 years because they are close and reasonably affordable.   They've since moved up the street into Krak's old space. Yes that was a real thing. That restaurant kept patrons away in droves with their small claustrophobic windows, heavy handed furniture and a general ambiance that suggested that medieval torture instruments were hidden in the basement. (You think I'm exaggerating only because you haven't seen the place.)  Based on the decor you'd expect your tea to be served in a beer stein and for there to be pig snout in your California roll.   I digress. I ordered there repatedly because the kitchen and staff were familiar. Until they weren't.   It also seems that since the move their fortunes have taken a turn for the worse.  The look of the place is uninviting and that has cut in to the traffic they see. This is understandably disappointing. But that does not excuse the poor quality of food or service that they subject their patrons to.   In a nutshell the food is subpar. The fish is ... Fishy. The rice is dry. And the chef seems put out the minute customers walk in the door.   I'm all for getting crappy service if the food is exceptional. But without the latter, the former is just misguided."}
{"text":"This place makes good maki,  we had their maki combo c, which is dynamite roll and spider roll for $16.95. It came out nicely and perfect"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful meal!  The waitress noticed that all the food ordered was veggie and thought to change my soup to salad, after asking me. Very thoughtful! The food was hot, what was meant to be. The service was fast and as well priced as any other sushi place on Ronci. Love the decor of the place and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Kami Sushi is within walking distance from my office and I go there when I am craving sushi for lunch.  And one thing I always get, no matter what, is a spicy salmon hand roll.  I have been to dozens and dozens of sushi places over the years and the chef's spicy handroll is by far the best. So for that they get a 5 star plus rating!  Its plump and spicy and fully of ooey gooey sushi goodness.  I have never had a problem with service, but I am a fairly regular customer so that might be why I have a better experience then some of the other reviews.  The Chef always welcomes me and says goodbye when I leave.  They even remember that I have a sulfer allergy and instead of the typical lettuce salad that I can' t eat, they serve me slices of tomato and cucumber with dressing.  Now they do lose a few stars for prices compared to other sushi spots that serve lunch, but my bento boxes have always been delicious and the sushi fresh.  The decor unfortunately as previously mentioned does remind me of a bdsm dungeon and you almost expect to find some chains attached to the walls and a medieval whipping post."}
{"text":"Incredible sushi in the west end. Great service, modest interior and delicious salmon sushi pizza!"}
{"text":"Haven't dined in yet but ordered delivery. Sushi was very tasty, no complaints and arrived quickly enough."}
{"text":"The food was a little overpriced but I found it to be quite fresh and very nicely presented. Between courses they brought out a complimentary dish of edamame and chocolate drizzled strawberries after the meal. That was a nice surprise!   The restaurant itself has a nice cozy yet classy atmosphere, however their choice in playing Christmas music made me want to get out of there. It's bad enough hearing that every time we leave the front door this time of year, I don't want my dinner serenaded by carols as well!   The service was a little slow and disorganized despite there only being two other tables occupied. The waitress was incredibly friendly but kept disappearing into the back room and hiding, forcing the sushi chef to constantly call her out and even serve a table himself.   Also, I'm not sure if they are liquor licensed? There was no drink menu at all.   I don't know if I'd go back because the price was a little steep for me ($50 for two of us - no drinks) but it was a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent! The staff are super nice, the presentation is gorgeous and there are many nice touches including free chocolate dipped strawberries after your meal. The specialty rolls are amazing and the fish is incredibly fresh. My favourite sushi restaurant in town by far."}
{"text":"Overall, the experience at Kami Sushi was decent. Space could've been brighter but the servers were really nice. I would've given them three stars but the Spicy Sushi combo I got (Spicy Salmon and Spicy Tuna) was mostly fried panko. There was almost no tuna in the 12 rolls of sushi in the combo.   The prices would be reasonable if there was more substance in the rolls."}
{"text":"It seems this place has got a lot of bad reviews...and maybe it's because I am Asian (?) that I had such a fabulous experience but I am a fan of this place.  My visit was on a Wednesday (maybe this makes a difference?) evening , and we had to settle for this place because the original destination was closed; I was thrilled since in this part of town, oriental food(I dunno how to call Korean, Chinese and Japanese food as a group, but that's what I mean) - unless Thai - has slim pickings.  We were greeted and seated right away. The waitress was rather friendly as were the chefs. I enjoyed the simple decor - I HATE places that's littered with trinkets and pieces of what they THINK is from that culture -so tacky. I digress. I was pleasantly surprised to see some of the popular Korean food on the menu as well, but only ones which compliment the Japanese cuisine, instead of having all the popular ones (like Pork Bone soup would have been a weird choice, although wildly popular).  Pros. I love that they put SOME thought into the presentation; this is something that seems to be lost in a lot off Oriental restaurants which open here, which is strange because in its native home there is a strong emphasis on them. Food should first be aesthetically pleasing. The service was excellent; they didn't check on us often but were there whenever replenishing and clearing was required. The staff whispered to each other to not disturb customer conversations which is VERY much the Japanese way...although it made eavesdropping hard XD The food was delicious; sushi pizza and rolls and the fish was fresh and cut and prepared in perfect bite sizes. The sesame ice cream was just like the ones my grandma used to make. MOSTLY IMPORTANTLY, the ginger tasted like GINGER. In fact, it was VERY fresh ginger - as if it was just marinated and have yet lost all its...gingeriness?? lol  Of course the complimentary strawberries with drizzles of chocolate was just the right touch. We were full but not with itis, which is the way it should be.  Cons. I don't have much to say about this. Yes, it is a bit higher priced; but Japanese food always is higher in price. We are so used to cheap bulk Sushi here that if it's cheap we will eat it even if it's old food. BLAGH.  The point of sushi is freshness and I am personally willing to pay a bit extra for freshness and attention to presentation which seems to be a dying art. I mean, aren't we all willing to pay extra at a high end restaurant for a quarter worth of food that's well presented and is fresh? I mean WHEN do you ever go to a Keg, and pay less than $50 for 2 people? And really thinking about it, I think the price here is very comparable to the Kyota place near King & Dufferin, though the quality of food and atmosphere here is much better.  THE BEEF I have is, that the KOREAN food on the menu is also expensive; I don't think Bulgogi anything should be over $10. Hwe- dup-bop is like Chirachi -raw fish on bed or rice, which merits the price the $10.50 price. Even so, I assume they are well presented and considering that this is one of the FEW (three as far as I know) places with Korean menu, I am willing to swallow the price - but I am, crazy so.... :P Also WHERE IS that Sake?  I can't believe I ate sashimi without Sake, although that was a refreshing change. One point for those who are sensitive about sodium intake; they don't have a low-sodium Soya sauce available, just the regular one in a cute ceramic teapot pouring thingie.  Extra star for being a decent place in this part of the city ; yes I will be returning for some sesame ice cream and that Crazy boy roll and the sushi pizza and ....well everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Amazing food, the nicest service in the world and very talented sushi master. Especially I recommend sushi pizza with salmon, it's addictive :)"}
{"text":"I moved to Roncy with my gf on June and, both of us being sushi lovers, set forth upon Roncesvales to find our new spot. After being let down by the other two spots in terms of quality/price ratio, we stumbled in to Kami. We have been going ever since!  The spicy rolls are ALL exceptionally good. I eat sushi wherever I can, and travel a lot for work, so I have tried a lot of spicy salmon rolls. These are honestly my favorite. Crunchy, spicy, flavourful and filling, these are my go to. The miso and salad are fairly average but always served promptly and they do the job. The spider roll is DELICIOUS and even the California rolls are good here (one of my least favorite rolls). Sashimi was really fresh and the lunch and all day specials are great value.  To top off the delicious, well priced sushi, the service is top notch. Jason, the owner, is a really great guy and you can tell is very passionate about the quality of his sushi. The servers are all friendly and welcoming, and I really enjoy the atmosphere here whether I am alone or with friends.  Go here. Go here often. Go here always. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good traditional sushi. Great service. Normally would give them 4.5, but the current average of 2.5 is just unfair to the current owners who show great care and passion in serving excellent food."}
{"text":"Just finished a disappointing takeout dinner from Vincent Sushi.  Ordered a sushi/maki combo.  The fish did not taste especially fresh, and the rice was somewhat dried out in parts.  The miso soup was the blandest I've ever had, and barely lukewarm.  But the worst part was the salad: it literally looked like soup, it had so much dressing, and the lettuce was wilted as if it had been dressed days ago.   Straight to the garbage.  I am not one to make a fuss, and the salad is always an afterthought with takeout sushi, but this was just an insult.  Moreover, when you start a meal with something that terrible and careless, it really makes you uneasy about eating raw fish prepared by the same kitchen.   Prices here are a little higher than comparable sushi restos, and there is certainly no justification for that.  Will not be back to Vincent Sushi, which is too bad as it's the nearest sushi restaurant to my home."}
