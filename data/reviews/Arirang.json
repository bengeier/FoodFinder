{"text":"service is good, we had AYCE BBQ, Meat is pretty good, but comparing with other Korean BBQ, they dont offer any  Korean sauce or veggies to go with it."}
{"text":"Arirang has always been our favourite Korean restaurant in Mississauga. It is close to home, the staff is always polite, the environment is pretty clean, the food is always of good quality, and I love their variety of banchan (side dishes). The other Korean restaurants in Mississauga that I have visited do not do banchan like Arirang does!  The service here may be a bit slow sometimes (when they are busy). I never have to wait for a table since I usually have early lunches (11-12pm) and dinners (5-6pm) so I cannot comment on how bad wait times can be.  This restaurant has all-you-can-eat BBQ, but we haven't tried it in almost a year. I remember it being pretty good, especially the LA ribs (you will walk out of there smelling like Korean BBQ), but for $20+tax for dinner on the weekend, we never bother because we are not big meat-eaters.  We have tried quite a few items off the menu but more recently, we tried their pork bone soup, soft tofu kimchi jjigae and dolsot bibimbap. Pork bone soup is always a bit messy but my family loves it. The soft tofu kimchi jjigae is amazing on a cold winter night and you are feeling rice instead of pho. Both of these soup dishes are always full of flavour; never too salty, never too spicy. The dolsot bibimbap is one of my favourite Korean dishes and it is pretty good at this restaurant. There are several different ingredients and sometimes, I even throw in some of the side dishes and mix it up some more.  The portions are pretty good for the price you pay. The above three dishes fed four of us at lunch, and it was perfect. I can finish one whole dish myself, but I would feel way too full afterwards. By the way, if you are hungry for spicy noodles and you like seafood, do try their jjambbong. It is always loaded with a lot of perfectly cooked noodles, some veggies and seafood, and it is full of flavour (gives you a bit of a kick!).   The competing Korean restaurant nearby is Owl but I find that restaurant is way too crowded, uncomfortable and the quality of their food is subpar. For about the same price, I always choose to sit comfortably and eat better at Arirang."}
{"text":"Recently I started coming to this place frequently since owls was always full. But the reason I've been coming here is actually because their porkbone soup and jajamyun is delicious!  The BBQ here is good too! It is a tad more expensive but when they come with extra food and your grill looks blacker than normal, they tell you to wait before putting more food on to get you a new grill."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. This is by far our favourite Korean Restaurant in Mississauga. My wife and I come here often and the Pork Bone Soup is just out of this World! The food is simply delicious. Ambience is great. Never crowded. Very clean. But one of the main reasons we keep coming back is because of Mrs.  Veronica Lee. She always welcomes us with such a great, genuine smile. Mrs. Lee really understands the art of making people feel welcome.  Thank you Mrs. Lee and may Arirang continue to prosper for many years to come.  Sincerely,  Brian and Masae Chaytor"}
{"text":"Good place for AYCE Korean BBQ. I haven't had a chance to try the regular menu yet so this review is strictly about the BBQ.   Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it was quite empty. My boyfriend and I got AYCE and we were surprised that we didn't get a menu or a selection sheet showing us what meat we can order. Instead, our server automatically brought us out a variety of different meats and banchans. We weren't told which meat was what meat so pretty much we were unsure what we were eating at first.   The food was good. Can't really comment on anything but the seasoning of the meat since it is a do it yourself kind of place but the flavour was on point. I ordered lettuce so I could wrap my meat with which enhances the taste. I would recommend.   The service was adequate. The restaurant has buzzers on every table that customers press if they need a server. Our server came and helped us every time we pressed the button but didn't ask us if the food was okay or anything.   Overall, not a huge selection for KBBQ but good for lunch, although a little pricey."}
{"text":"If you're coming and expecting all you can eat KOREAN BBQ, don't come here. The marinated meat is good but you can only order pork, beef and chicken meat, bulgogi and LA kalbi; didn't include samgyupsal.  And you have to pay extra for lettuce, garlic and samjang (Korean dipping sauce). We were very dissapointed, not to mention one the waiters looked like he hated his job, so it kind of made us uncomfortable. It wasn't a horrible experience, but not the K-BBQ experience we were hoping for."}
{"text":"The all you can eat option is quite good. However, the woman in charge (manager perhaps) came and told us last rounds for orders just before an hour and twenty minutes into the meal. Also, she kept glaring at us the entire time, as though we were eating too much (6 guys); rather disrespectful."}
{"text":"Hello friends! I like this place when in the mood for some good BBQ. My friend and I had the all u can eat menu with seafood, and it was good. But then again we did bbqed it ourselves.. Lol. Service is decent and the price is ok. Will come back again when i have a craving.  Peace!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick Korean BBQ.  Nothing special here.  One thing I didn't like, was the fact they all decided to sit down and eat together while there were many patrons inside.  Most people seemed reluctant to bother them while they were eating.  I managed to only bother them once, in the hopes they would finish eating fast, and attend to their patrons.  This was not the case.  Not only did they take their sweet ass time eating, they left their customers hanging.  1 star for mediocre food,   1 star for being nice, with crappy service.  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time yesterday with 5 of my friends for dinner. I have never in my life had such bad a rude service especially from a Korean restaurant. I've been to countless ayce places and Korean restaurants but never one this badly run. We went in for AYCE paid holiday price which is fair but not for what we received. We placed our order for 2 of everything they had on the menu which is not a lot for a group of 6. They didnt bother to bring out vegetables even tho we ordered. Then when I asked for it the 2nd round of ordering the server was very rude and told me it only comes once. Oki I understand that but it did not come at all and he even questioned my table as if he didnt believe that we did not get vegetables. We didnt say anything when it didnt come out again but this time when we went to order more meat for the table, the server thinks its okay to change our order saying well I don't think you'll finish that so I'll give u one of each meat instead???? What type of restaurant is this?!?! Never have I had someone question my order and then decide to bring what they wanted instead. Not to mention they were reluctant to bring us rice that was included in the price we paid!!! I understand when smaller tables come in and servers are worried they are over ordering but there was 6 of us!!! Most of us were still hungry by the time we came out but we couldn't stand the service. If you choose to be an AYCE BBQ place don't be shocked when ur customers actually order a 2nd round of food! If u want to be stingy then pls do not go into the food industry.  Now, come check out we call over the server again, same guy and he asks us split or together. When we tell him split he looks so irritated and tells us well then you can go to the front to pay. I from the very get go was not planning on tipping nor was my table as we got horrible service and attitude. So when we go to the front to pay we learn that they put 15% service charge. My group was slightly irritated by this fact but I understand establishments do this for groups of 6 or more so fine. But when we started paying their servers did not know how to cash us out, 1 transaction took 15 minutes as they couldn't do the math with cash. We offered to use card to make it easier but the server just told us to wait. Very unprofessional. Another note, there debit machine kept disconnecting due transaction so they made my friend try 3 of her cards as they thought it was her problem. It was not. They even question one of my other friends transaction saying in Korean \"maybe they don't have enough money\" but no by the end it was rejecting half our groups cards and note we used it during boxing day shopping. No apology or anything from the staff and the manager watching this happen! Then when it was finally my turn to pay, my bill came to 33.84 and I gave the server 100 and I stood there for another 15 minuted waiting for him to give me my change. He went back and forth from the register and the calculator all the while I'm telling him my change is 66.15. I understand he has to probably bunch it in to open the til but I just don't understand why it took so long for him and the lady next to him to figure it out???? Overall, I would rate this place 0 stars if I could. I will never go back to this place because as a working server myself, I do not want to support a place that thinks treating their customers like this is OK. Also, it saddens me that people like this expect to be paid and tip the way they do, when other harder working individuals deserve it more."}
{"text":"This AYCE seems catered towards mid-upper range. I generally enjoy my meats/sauces a little sweet,  so I've been going here for years because I love the marinade/quality of the meats. Most other places are marinaded for the salty taste or with hints of curry. The grill is not on super high to cook your meats super fast to rush you out faster. The cuts of meat are a bit thicker and will take longer to cook so if you're looking to eat and enjoy instead of rushing, this place is a good location!   The service and staff are really friendly though the older staff have limited English-speaking capability so there may be a language barrier. In the recent days, they seem to have hired new younger staff who do speak English well though."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here last night with my family a group of 11 with 1 child.  We ordered the all you can eat.  It was my first time eating at a Korean restaurant.  Each table has a gas grill.  You place your food on the grill.  It was odd at first but after the first bite I new I was hooked.  After the second batch I realized I can prepare the beef the way I like it...BLOODY.     ***Important note at the end of the table there`s a button if you need service just hit the button and a server is there within 30 sec."}
{"text":"Better than Chako! The All you can eat korean bbq option is reasonable $19.99 for dinner. You get your usual banchan and an assortment of meats (bulogogi, pork, chicken and Kalbi) I just usually eat the bulgogi and Kalbi. Mussels and squid were mediocre. No all you cant eat sushi option in this place. The  service however is great. Water was always refilled without having to ask, the grill was frequently changed also without having to beg like Chako. All in all pretty good place considering the limited korean bbq choices in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The service is terrible! And the foods' size changed to very small. Disappointed! We don't wanna go there anymore."}
{"text":"Good speed of service, good selection.  Korean BBQ unlimited and well marinated. Enjoyable for sure.  This is a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Came here after a hungry swim, and I have to say it is one of the better KBBQ places I've been to.  I got the Sangyeopsal and Bulgogi combo, and I was pretty happy with it! I came with a few of my nieces and nephews, and they were all happy with their meals too.  We also ordered a Spicy Seafood Soup which was also pretty good!    Service here was excellent, there is a button on the side of the table so you can easily call a waiter when you need them.  Otherwise, the waiters came by occasionally to ask how our meal was, etc.  Very friendly and professional service.    The restaurant was pretty clean, but like many others have stated, the BBQ smell is very strong.  They had fans above every table to help air out the restaurant a bit.  One minor complaint was that I came with a party of 6, so we were seated at a square table with the grill in the middle.  Two adults, and 4 children; the adults sat in the middle in order to grill the meat, while the children sat on the outside.  This made it impossible for the adults to control the heat settings located at the end side of the table, which was a bit inconvenient.    Pricing was adequate, not totally cheap, but it was manageable! I'll definitely be back some time soon!"}
{"text":"Not sure why some of these people be talking all that ****.  Waitress/staff real nice and really attentive.   Food was decent. Let's be honest.. you cannot expect a fantastic meal at a AYCE Korean BBQ that only charges 17.95$ for dinner. That said.. it seems like all the meat was marinated in the same sauce (which was decent in my personal opinion). Meat cut's were standard.. nothing fancy. It's quite simple really... You get what you paid for.  Honestly, I would go back just to satisfy that protein binge all human beings crave once in a while."}
{"text":"Really did not enjoy my visit to Arirang.  We got the all you can eat barbeque, but it was disappointing at best.  The place smelled of stale oil, the meat selection was extremely limited and it tasted the same, whether it was beef, pork or chicken.  The side dishes like kimchi and bean sprouts were also were limited.  The grate used for cooking is stainless steel, and not cast iron as I have previously seen.  The food was taking a while to cook, did not sear very well, the temperature was inconsistent. Plus they charged $11 for a 3 year old child, who only ate a bit of my side of steamed rice and one slice of chicken.  Seemed excessive, as I could have gotten a bibimbap for that price, where she would have had more ingredients and a larger portion. I will definitely not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy Goat Soup  $14.40 with tax all in. Soup came out in 5 minutes. It looked good but that's not how  it tasted broth was a bit plan like it was a bit water down . Not spicy at all very little goat meat. Meat was not fresh.  I would never order that again  very over priced. The decor looks beat up broken chairs pop cases by the door way.  Serves was good even though I was the only one in that place at 2pm on a Wednesday.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Definitely in line with what others are saying - has some potential, but dodgy service practices and time constraints kill what should be an AAA business.  The fact that Arirang is buried in the back of a plaza, in what's otherwise a very barren area of the city, is a bit offputting, but you wouldn't know it by how many cars are vying for spots in and around this place. My friends and I visited here for a New Year's get-together, and were surprised by how packed the plaza was despite the holiday.  I have to agree with what a lot of reviews are saying: the service is the big killer for this place. When you're not trying to flag down a server, they do indeed give you weird looks and try to rush you out. We were in an empty restaurant and the staff were pushing us to finish up after an hour-and-a-half. I don't see anyone else coming in the place, and the restaurant wasn't closing for at least two hours, so you can cool your jets.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with the people they hire or a top-down policy, but their behavior is very aloof and detached. If you're not ordering the buffet, you might as well not even exist, and I'm not a fan of the way they try to push mandatory tips on you. You think your service was worth an extra $10 per person? GTFO.  Having said that, the food is quite good. The buffet offers up large portions of chicken, beef and lamb, along with oysters, vegetables and a odd assortment of other side dishes. As opposed to Chako (which gives up smaller plates of a la carte items with more selection of meats), Arirang opts for larger plates with a smaller selection pool. Everything was quite tasty, but I was missing some of the more out-there options like ox tongue.  Overall, the experience was decent but there were some shortcomings that needed to be addressed. If you can get past the dumpy atmosphere and weird service, there's some good food to be had here. Just keep your expectations in check - nearly $35 after tax (and without a tip) is a bit much for such a small handful of menu items."}
{"text":"Considering it's the only KBBQ spot I know of in Mississauga, it's the best KBBQ restaurant I've been to!  Customer service was great! The waiters/waitresses knew when to come to our table to serve us. When our grill became black, they switched it quickly and efficiently. My friends and I decided to try the AYCE which is $21.99 per person. We were given chicken, pork, beef, kalbi, squid, shrimp, and mussels; side dishes included kimchi, seaweed, bean sprouts, etc.   My only complaint is the overwhelming smell of grills everywhere! You eventually get used to it and they do have fans to blow away the smell; however, you leave the restaurant feeling ritzy."}
{"text":"I came with family wanting some Korean BBQ to cook on the grill but when we got there we decided to get a-la-carte instead of AYCE. We figured we would rather get the right portion of food with quality meats versus being overstuffed with regular quality meats. Their set BBQ combo for 5 people was also cheaper than AYCE. Even though there were 6 of us, we thought it would be enough since most Asian restaurants I go to tend to feed more than what's suggested! AYCE is about $27 and the combo is $125, much cheaper when dividing with 6 people.   Our server was very difficult to communicate with. I don't think she was able to understand so they changed our server halfway through our dinner.  The combo comes with quality cuts of beef (2 plates of sliced meat - not even full plates and a portion of it was mushrooms and onions) and an assortment of seafood (1 plate mixed with shrimp, mussels, squid, scallop and more onion). NOT WORTH $125!!!!! Very expensive for what you get.   And a bowl of white rice on the side is $2....maybe I'm just cheap but I think that's really expensive too.  Our server told us if we got 6 orders of rice, we would get free bean curd soup...um no thanks. He gave us the soup anyway because I think he felt bad.   We also got side dishes but that comes with every meal anyway.   Was it good? Yes Was it worth it? No Would I come back? Maybe but I definitely won't be ordering the same thing."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 star.  Food was delicious (BBQ and Jap Chae and eel). Service was friendly enough but unattentive--they seemed understaffed when we were there, and we had to ask for every single thing we wanted including reminding them to bring the beers we ordered.  They do have an all your can eat Korean BBQ deal that seems like a good value.  This place is worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good (all you can eat) but not worth it for a Friday lunch at $20.  The price for Monday to Thursday lunch is $15.95 which we thought we were paying. The difference is that you get shrimp that were not deveined but not a huge thing to dead with .   Our server was excellent, and replaced our grill top when it was needed.   Still enjoyed it but not for lunch on a Friday."}
{"text":"A whole weekend of Korean food it seems.   I was there Friday for the All-You-Can-Eat and there were no complaints.   I was there again the same weekend on a Sunday. The best thing to get there is actually the Jampong! It's delicious if you're a spice fanatic like me.  I go with my Korean girlfriend and they go there often so you know that it's pretty good authentic food.  Bring an extra shirt if you're going out after, the BBQ smell is potent."}
{"text":"Went for friday lunch. Only one server. But he came pretty quickly when the little call button was pressed. Fridays its $20 ayce all day. Found it way too pricey for what we got. The meat was basically like Chako which is wayyyy cheaper and has veggies and icecram which this place doesn't. Its supposed to be more authentic but I couldn't say it was other than the spicy pork which was different and the steel chopstickd. Ordered green tea icecram which was $4!  Food was good but too pricy to return for ayce. Will try a la carte items though."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and have that itch for Korean food, give this place a try.  Among other Korean restaurants in Mississauga, their food and prices are up there in value. Any main dish you order comes with at least 4 \"ban chan\", otherwise known as side dishes. They are happy to refill for you as long as you are able to finish it. They also serve a small bowl of garlic rice porridge which has good flavour and texture.  Unlike other foodie patrons who visit here for their AYCE bbq, my wife and I ordered the Mul Naeng Myun. In this heat, it is a great dish to order because it comes with large ice chunks to cool it down. The flavour is spot-on once you add your dose of mustard and vinegar. They garnish it with a boiled egg and julienne slices of red pepper and cucumber. You may find yourself slurping away at the noodles a lot more than talking to the people you came to eat with. Now if they would just fix their window and get rid of that large tarp, I can give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with my family for AYCE. It was around 26 per person for the whole day since today is a holiday, but I think weekdays are 20 for lunch and 23 for dinner. The restaurant itself is pretty big too so a large group can also be seated (maybe better to reserve first).   First I was pleased with the service, everything was pretty quick and our refills were quick as well. I love AYCE both sushi and bbq so I've been to lots of different places, but the quality here is definitely top-notch. We also ordered some samgyupsal, and that is also a good choice for anyone who loves to eat pork belly.   They have some good side dishes, and overall I think its awesome compared to the price. I've been to cheaper places with some of my friends, but there is definitely a difference in quality as much as the difference in price. I also really enjoy AYCE sushi as well but that goes up to 30 per person on just dinners, so for eating some good quality AYCE meat I think its great.   Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat good quality AYCE meat for a fair price. If you're looking for a really cheap place to fill your stomach, you should look somewhere else."}
{"text":"For Korean BBQ this place is okay.   With Honey Pig and Iron Age to compare to in MD it seemed eh.   Was kind of underwhelmed by the BBQ selection, and portions were much smaller than what I thought they would be.    But the food was good, and our waitress was nice and very friendly making small talk."}
{"text":"It's alright. I guess it's good for a quick Korean BBQ fix in the 905 area. I'm used to going to North York (Yonge & Finch) for Korean Soju Combos, so nothing in Mississauga can compete. LOL."}
{"text":"For years, I would only go to Markham for KBBQ because I couldn't not find a decent one near home. I am so glad we found Arrirangs because I really do enjoy eating here. I like that they've got seperate sections for those who want to eat from the regular menu, and that you can still order from the regular menu while eating kbbq. I didn't like the marinates at first, because everything tasted the same, but Ive grown to love it now. Service is great because every tables got a ringer!"}
{"text":"We went pretty late at night, i think about an hour before closing. They had no problem serving us and the quality of the food was very good, no signs of using leftovers etc. The only disappointing thing was that they don't have dessert, which i found was weird because every kbbq place i've been too at least has ice cream as dessert. Another bad thing about the place was that near the end of our meal a spider fell from the ceiling into our dish. Thankfully we were already done eating. But just thinking about the fact that we ate in a restaurant with spiders hanging on top of us gave us goosebumps. Overall it was a nice place and we had a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Seafood pancake and AYCE BBQ.  Note the BBQ must be ordered for minimum of 2 people.  It's one of those places where you have to ring for service.  Service is okay and about  what you expect in asian restaurants, sorry to stereotype.  Food is good although I've had a better seafood pancake elsewhere.  All the BBQ meats were fresh and tasty.  You get a couple of banchan but would have been nice to have a few more."}
{"text":"This was the first meal on our arrival to Mississauga, was holding high expectations but...  Price: it was $17.95 per person, so it was reasonable  Service: There were maybe 4 servers for the entire restaurant.  They were nowhere to be found when you need them the most.  Granted there is a bell on each table to ring for service, but it takes awhile.  Food:  For the four of us, they gave us just enough portions.  When we get the server's attention, we try to order as much as we can because we know it will be awhile.  Not a lot of variety on side dishes, just bean sprouts, daikon, kimchi and veggies.  Compared to my typical K-BBQ place which gives you about 11 different side dishes, only 2 star here.   HOWEVER...  Their Ox Bone soup is TO DIE FOR!!!  The broth was amazing, spicy and just flavorful... the only reason I tagged on another star to make them a 3-star."}
{"text":"I live in Toronto and have access to KBBQ at Yonge and Finch. I've also tried places like Korean Grill House and Chingu (now renamed to JangWon) on the east end of GTA. I still think Arirang is the best and recently came all the way to eat KBBQ here (and to meet some friends).   They have AYCE and also a regular menu. I always got AYCE. The notable difference vs other places is that seafood is included in their standard AYCE. When you consider that it's only $22 (or $23? I forgot) per person, it's a good deal. I love grilled shrimp. Kalbi is always good! We ordered lots of kalbi and the server looked shocked at how much we ate. Their sauce is slightly different from other places I've tried. It's more mild.   It was busy that night and service was just so-so. The other disappointment is that they don't have pork belly which is a Korean staple. But these 2 facts can be overlooked because I love their kalbi and shrimp very much. This place is high on my consideration list when I want to pig out and I happen to be in Sauga."}
{"text":"Went here in February - had a reservation since it was valentine weekend.  Have to say - service was extremely slow but the food was definitely worth the wait!!  I plan on going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good choices and great service.  Will definitely go back.  I had the Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Arirang for all you can eat Korean BBQ. First off, I was not impressed with the selection. You only have the choice of beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, mussel and squid for dinner. There was no vegetables & no extras. Just the typical free small Korean dishes (bean sprout, kimchi etc). The cost is 26.99 plus tax + tips. Although the flavor was good, all the meat was seasoned the same leading to me being bored of the flavor soon after. There was also no dessert .. You can get much more variety at other places.  The service was efficient however, food came quick."}
{"text":"Even though the majority come for kbbq. The pork bone soup has to be one of the best in the city.  Their jajang myun is damn good too.  I believe they make the noodles fresh.  The kbbq is really good but can be a bit pricey. The only thing i hate is smelling like food after because of the bbq nature but it cant really be helped."}
{"text":"Went for lunch recommended by a friend that is Korean. Shared spicy fish soup and eel dish. Everything was very good and not to expensive"}
{"text":"I don't know if I like Korean food or not, but I find it's great to have during the winter when you need to warm up.  So I decided to Arirang (and don't ask me to pronounce it) and try something different; Spicy Goat Soup.  I've had goat before, but never spicy and never in a soup.  What's my conclusion: Goat was nice and tender, and soup was spicy, but it was bearable and it also had taste.  I hate it when places just make it overly hot.  The soup itself was $12.95.  Also, as per Korean tradition, there was banchan which included bean curd, seaweed, shitake mushrooms, carrot and bean sprouts.  They also tasted pretty good, especially the mushrooms.    My only qualm: Banchan came at the same time (possibly after) I got my main course.  I would have preferred it come first so I would have something to snack on.    As for service, while there was only one server, he was very nice and even offered to re-fill the side dishes.  A+ for that.    Verdict: Give it a try."}
{"text":"Food tasted mediocre. We got the Korean BBQ. Service was slow and restaurant was very cold! Almost every single item was overly sweet. Side dishes were limited."}
{"text":"Quality  food! The beef is my favourite but upset that you can't order veggies on the all you can eat. The sauce they use to marinate the meat is everything! And the staff is always very nice and accommodating! Definitely a place I will visit again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times for AYCE bbq.  Food is quite tasty.   Funny thing is I never noticed that it came with veggies (onions, zucchini and potatoes) which was surprisingly good especially the potatoes but you can only get that 1 time.  Also came with unlimited rice, salad and side dishes. (Kimchi, beansprouts, seaweed and radish).  Overall, good experience as always and service is great."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pork bone soup! Its probably the best I've had in Mississauga. Their korean BBQ is also really good.  Its about $25/person for all you can eat.  Their jajang myun is also really good and decent size portion.  Just expect to smell like grilled meat when you leave lol."}
{"text":"Came here after passing by this restaurant a couple of times and it was pretty good for an all you can eat. The prices is reasonable and the meat portion was considerably a lot compared from the usual ones we get elsewhere.  The restaurant has a good amount of tables available and I believe there is a time limit posted on how long you can sit for the all you can eat. Am not sure if it only applies during busy hour though.  Anyway, everything was really good for a restaurant based in Mississauga. I would go again in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Korean food, decent prices, great service.  There are times they have the bus tours come in which can delay service but the food is always fresh and authentic :)    One Tues night, I forgot a bag there and when I returned ( 5 days later ) the next Sunday they recognized me immediately and returned the bag to me with all my valuables untouched!!!   Just wonderful honest people with great home-style Korean cooking !"}
{"text":"Came here for the Korean all you can eat. Bit different than what I was used to at a korean all you can eat.   All you can eat is a bit more pricey, no free refills, and the meat was really not as flavourful as many other places.  Might be a place to come to order off the regular menu, but there are also many other korean places around to try first."}
{"text":"the worst Korean BBQ experience that I ever had. Bad Food quality for the price, 24$ per person, and there is no sevice. Only 7 dishs for you to choose. I'll give this restaurant 0 Star if I can!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for kbbq that's actually owned by Koreans.   Their meat looks fresh.  Service is good.  About $22 per person for weekday dinner."}
{"text":"Great place! We had the all you can eat option and did not leave disappointed. Soooo much food! The plates that they bring you are filled! Need more food? Water? Whatever? You don't have to wait until someone shows up, you have your own call bell at your table. Ring it and someone is there within a few seconds. The waitress was good enough to suggest the all you can eat. Basically the things we were all ordering separately, came in the all you can eat. Very happy when wait staff watch out for your best interest and make suggestions.  I've only been here once, but I definitely want to go back. The menu is large so there are definitely reasons to go back."}
{"text":"Sauga AYCE K-BBQ, gets a fobby peace sign!  The goal this summer is to try not to go to my favorite hot spots, so here I am @ a Korean BBQ that's no where near Korea Town or Downtown, yes I know I am skeptical too. But since I live in Sauga I might as well figure out which Korean restaurant is the best in Sauga.  The last time I was here it was not called Arirang and it didn't look as nice as it is now. They've totally updated the place, before to me it looked like a cafeteria, now it looks so modern, the dark tones give it a very nice feel. The restrooms as well was very clean both male and female at least that's what she said.   There are a lot of items on the menu from your traditional BBQ, Bipbimbop, soup and AYCE! We decided to go for the AYCE the weekend special which included shrimp, mussels, pork, bulgogi, kalbi, and chicken which cost $19.99 which if you ask me is a lil pricey compared to the ones d/t. If you were to get the lunch AYCE it's just the meat no seafood which is $15.99 and dinner is $17.99 with just the meat as well. Lastly with the AYCE there is 1.5hr time limit.  First biggest thing I notice was the grill, it wasn't a grill it was this piece of metal, kinda like what tepanyaki chefs cook on, at first I thought it was a good idea b/c then your food wouldn't burn, but the moment you put the food on it it didn't grill the food it just seared it, you didn't get that experience of a BBQ. As well it seem to take twice as long to cook the food.  The service was crappy at first b/c our waiter was never around or in sight for that matter, but, then I eventually realize that there was a call button and then BOOM service was amazing. Our waiter probably hated us though b/c we kept pushing that button every 5 minutes to order more seafood. He should of just brought us a tonne of seafood like we asked but he just kept bringing out the same amount everytime. His fault not mine!   Normally I would talk about how the food was but it wasn't the greatest AYCE K-BBQ I've ever been too. I guess you're ust gonna have to wait till I go back to see if their a la carte is better lets hope.  Items to definitely get:  - to be continued"}
{"text":"Does anyone know if this place is accessible? my friend is in a wheelchair and wants to go... Thanks"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the regular menu items as I have not tried the KBBQ here. The entire store is enveloped in the KBBQ smell when you enter, which certainly makes you doubt opting for the regular menu. Anyhow, the Pork Bone Soup that I consistently order here can be a hit or a miss. Sometimes, it is amazing, other times, not so good (either too bland or too salty). A small bowl of congee is also served prior to your meal, which is actually pretty tasty and something I always look forward to.  The side dishes that arrive complementary to your meal has good variety, they are also refillable without additional charge (or attitude)! The service is fine, nothing remarkable or worth mentioning."}
{"text":"I have never been too fond of Korean cuisine. The only Korean food I usually indulge in is the Nong Shim instant noodles. But today I decided upon something new, seeking great flavours to satisfy my hunger.   After a long day of school, my friends and me drove towards Arirang. We quickly received our tables and sat comfortably in a table booth near the windows. We decided upon the AYCE Korean BBQ.  The dishes of raw meats starting piling up on our table. Vegetarians beware- this meal just got meatier (forgive my terrible attempt at humour). Beef, pork, chicken and much more, arrived ready to be grilled. The meats were marinated in a Korean BBQ sauce. The taste, in my opinion, seemed to be lacking. However the meats tasted fresh and tender.   Sides of kimchi, seaweed and others arrived at our table along with the meats. The kimchi is spicy yet is too salty. If you eat the kimchi along with a bowl of rice, the saltiness subsides.  Food taste better if you are not expecting much. Arirang changed my consensus on Korean BBQ. I will return again for more delicious food If hunger strikes you unexpectedly, race towards Arirang."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere to eat. We went for the all you can eat dinner. Portion was good size for the prize. The side dish like the seaweed and the other thing were tasteless.  Radish was great though. Beef, chicken were great. Pork not so much. The pork was too thick and too hard to eat.  Server was constantly forgetting our orders. But she was very nice and apologize about it. She was really humble. One time is ok to go there to try"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. The food was alright. The service was not that great. We had to wait so long to get someone to put down our orders and even for our tea! You'd think the bell would be helpful but it wasn't. The server saw our bell ring but ignored it."}
{"text":"I come here almost every week with my family because they are die hard fans of Samgyeopsal. Pork no longer sits well in my system because of a bad food poisoning incident I had a while back, but at Arirang, I can't help but treat myself to a few pieces. This place gives you thick cuts of meat that grill nicely and stay tender.  A part from the BBQ, they also serve up some good dishes from their regular menu. I'd recommend both the mool and bibim neng myun. My dad says go for the yook gal tang - he gets it everytime. Service is a little disorganized but definitely not the worst I've encountered.  Overall, some pretty solid Korean food."}
{"text":"To start, I thought the food was very bland. I ordered a bento box. The starters/ side dishes were okay and I liked the atmosphere (its pretty quiet and empty most of the time). Sushi 168 which is right beside the place has better sushi than this place does. I would rather walk to 168 then get sushi here. Korean food is pretty good but I really didn't enjoy any of the Japanese food they served."}
{"text":"Service was awesome, Korean waitress was very helpful. She noticed when I needed more water and offered more side dishes. 4.5 star food 5 star service"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening; if you're a lover of meat bursting with flavour, then you've come to the right place. Go for the All-you-can-eat Korean bbq option, every dish is marinated with delicious sauces. We were served by this little old lady, who was cute as a button and sweet as pie. Served right away. Atmosphere is comfortable and renovated. It's delicious. Returning again!  Re: edit--- I returned here, but this time, tried their regular menu, instead of the 'all you can eat'. I would suggest to not try their regular menu.  I ordered Bibimbap, which is a popular korean dish with meat, veggies, egg, rice etc, but there was only a teaspoon of meat. It was so disappointing!! So lesson learned, only come here for the all you can eat meat."}
{"text":"Arirang has pretty good AYCE K-BBQ. Its the standard cook-it-yourself grill table. Green iced tea was okay. Service was okay. Unfortunately, the waitress was hard to understand and seemed like she was in a rush all the time. Even though it wasn't even busy. It was hard to flag her down to top off my water...  I really enjoyed the grilled mussels and squid (white flesh with the purple skin cut off) those were my favorite of the whole meal (that's what set this review to four stars). The chicken and steak cuts were tasty. Pork belly was okay. The side of sweet sauce they had was pretty good with the squid and beef.  Side dishes were forgettable - I think there was only like four of them.  Since I lived in LA (where K-BBQ is everywhere), I've been to places where the variety of sides were plentiful. The kimchi was okay but I really enjoyed the sprouts. White rice was good and it came in individual metal pots to keep extremely warm.  Not bad..."}
{"text":"I decided to choose Arirang for some Korean BBQ after reading the positive reviews from other Yelpers. We did the AYCE and were given: chicken, kalbi, squid, shrimp, mussels, pork, and beef. Each person is about $21.99.  Service was great the entire time we were there. We never had to call for a server because they knew just when to come ask us for anything. When our grill got all black they would already have a new one to switch it with.  Food was good but I don't have much Korean BBQ experience to compare it to. My faves was the seafood. I thought the chicken should have been sliced differently because they were very small.  Arirang also has a few fans within the restaurant to air out the smell. However, the smell is quite overwhelming and strong when you enter. We got used to it after a bit.  Note: Shower after having Korean BBQ or bring a change of clothes if you are planning to go meet with friends after."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed, this is not a good korean bbq place at all. Chakos for the win!"}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5-3*s.  If you're not doing AYCE BBQ, the menu is very limited as there are only a coupla sections to order from, re:  soups, udon, & a few bibimbaps.  BBB is sorta $$$.  $12 for for a bowl of rice with a few things scattered atop?  Not the greatest value especially if you finish it all in one go!  I ordered the Beef Bone Soup ($8.95) which I thought was gonna be Yukgaejang, but it was more of white, brothy, dish water soup with some slices of what looked to be beef tongue and a few clear noodles.  It came with a bowl of rice which I never ate.  Soup was more something that I'd eat if I wasn't feelin' well as it was very \"ching\" (translation:  clear, bland).   The free congee that came before the meal was probably the tastiest thing out of my entire meal.  (It did contain ham though for all you non-porkie peeps!)  There were 6 side dishes in total, good variety, and they were alright.  All in all, I don't think this is the best place for Korean food in Mississauga, esp. if you're not doing the BBQ option.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"A shameful attempt at Korean food. Arirang bi bim bhap costs $12 but quality of ingredients would be closer to $5. I told the chef and waiting staff that their food was awful and if this is their attempt at quality food then they have missed the mark. If i could give a negative star then i would had done so. I will never return."}
{"text":"Good selection for bbq food. All you can eat lunch buffet is a very good deal. Get to try a lot of different items on the menu. It is reasonably priced and the service was good. Definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Compared to Chako? Flavour-wise, Arirang is better! But very limited items for such an expensive AYCE price. AND THEY DONT HAVE DESSERTS.... what  plus, the tables and floors are either sticky or dirty.  But, we always come back here for their BEEF KALBI, MUSSELS & BEEF BULGOGI.   They have \"bells\" for servers which is nice because no more hand-raising tryna get our server's attention.   Overall, they have nice flavours on bbq items. But just needed to do few touch ups & cleaning."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Arirang yesterday and wow, I was full until about 7pm!   We'd gone to Arirang shortly after they opened, many years ago and then for some reason hadn't been back (probably because Owl of Minerva became our go-to).  Anyway, yesterday we decided to give it another try and we weren't sorry.  I ordered the Soon Tofu with pork and my husband ordered the pork bone soup. Both were really delicious.  The soon tofu was just the perfect amount of spicy and had plenty of tofu and pork in it. The gamjatang had a delicious broth and lots of meaty bones. The side dishes were also very plentiful and all fresh and yummy.  The waitress was very friendly and extremely attentive, noticing that our tea needed topping up 4 or 5 times.  Two small complaints (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) were that the potato in the gamjatang was a little bit hard (needed maybe 5 more minutes of cooking) and that the floors were very slippery in the restaurant, as if they had a light coating of oil.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"1. Service: The service here was adequate & they do have the little bell on the side which calls a server over instead of you having to wave one down.  2. Food: Food was decent - the variety didn't astound me but I was satisfied when I left. I only come here during the weekend for dinner as I'm never able to find shrimp in other AYCE KBBQ.  3. Pricing: Pricing increased by a $2 since the last time I came and compares to other local Korean grill houses  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant were the grills they provided.  Usually a grill is shared between 2 people.  But in a table of 6 - there was one, 2-person grill..   Will be back :)"}
{"text":"I write this at 2:00 a.m. as I am woken up by an insatiable thirst for water. I wasn't going to bother to review this restaurant, but I want to be sure I have recorded our experience.  My husband and I ate at Arirang Korean Bbq Restaurant last night for the first and last time.   Walked in and first noticed it very smokey and sticky. I don't think the ventilation was working then or if ever. The place needs a good scrub down.   We ordered the All you can Eat Korean BBQ.  We were brought a small portion of assorted meats and sea foods. Service started out ok, but got slower as we would ask for more. Each time we did ask for another round, the server would take our order with an uncomfortable judgment.  We ordered 3 times.   The food was nothing but OK. Nothing great tasting. No \"wow\" factor. Price was OK - $25 each and does not include dessert.    All in all, I have to say that Chako was much better, cleaner, and not smokey. Service is also much kinder and efficient at Chako. The best part of the meal was once when we left our seats and the door opened to fresh, clean air.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a terrible restaurant!! I don't want to give even one star for this place.I went there for the first time and ordered all you can eat. I was surprised they charge for the side dish(which usually for free most of the Korean restaurant) and even small amount of dipping sauce and lettuce. What kind of all you can eat place do such a thing !?After about 1 hour, the server told us 'it's a last call' which nobody mentioned us about the time limit before. And ALSO, they charged us Weekend price even it's weekday and not even a holiday!! We noticed that after we got home. Seriously...this place is terrible and I don't recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Dinner AYCE was great at Arirang. It was $24.99 per person which included rice, plenty of side dishes, and an app salad.   The LA Beef Kalbi was on the slightly chewy side. My favourite was the Bulgogi Beef as it was tender and perfectly marinated. Other notable items included the Bulgogi Chicken. The squid was a disappointment though, it lacked flavour and did not have a good bounce to it.  I think I would visit again next time but opt for the Lunch AYCE since the Dinner option which included a couple more items wasn't really worth it."}
{"text":"I got the dolsot bibimbap which was pretty mediocre. There was a tiny amount of beef in it. and the sauce used wasn't very good. It was large but consisted mostly of rice. I'd put it on par with Owl of Minerva, and I don't really like that place either. There are much better Korean places in Mississauga. The complimentary side dishes were okay, but plentiful. Service and atmosphere were the usual."}
{"text":"Couple months ago me and my family went to Arirang Korean BBQ . We went on Friday ,on bills showing is almost $100 for 2 adult & 1 child after paying the bill the waitress asking where is my tips ? Really ?!"}
{"text":"Mmmm more like 2.5*~ Came by Sat night at around 630pm with 7 people and we had made reservations a day prior. (Literally only came here because we knew they had Green Grape flavoured Soju). However, I've never been here before so I wanted to give this place a try anyways. So, a group of 7 is pretty big for kbbq and it's better to have at LEAST 2 grills right?? When we came in, the first person brought us in and said we cant move the tables but if you guys want you guys can sit at 2 tables (6 seater each) but just split up in the middle. That was fine to us since there's more then one grill and I guess more table space. We got seated, getting ready to order.. then a different employee approached us and asked us to combine to sit in one table.. we were skeptical because 1 grill was not enough to cook for that many people. We ended up moving and one person sat at the end but it WAS NOT THAT BUSY the whole time we were there. We stayed from 630-845~.   We ordered all the dishes that AYCE came with: Seafood: squid + shrimp was not as popular Meats: beef + chicken + kalbi most popular; non popular was the pork kalbi Sides: bean sprouts + kimchi most popular; non popular was the seaweed, radishes, potato and zucchinis. Rice was ordered when needed.   My preference for the beef is that it should be sliced thinly and placed nicely so that its easy to grab to grill. At Arirang, it's kinda all clumped up so we ended up 'stir-frying' it - also trying to grill as much food as we can to fill up 7 peoples plate faster lol. We only had to change the grill once and had a fair share of meats to grill. Grape soju was really good; we ordered 3 bottles and that was easily split up on the bills per person.  I'm the person that usually tries to clean up the table a bit, clearing up the empty meat dishes and putting them aside to make more room. Depends on which server comes, they'll take the empties away. A few instances where they were left alone and stacks of places were just sitting on my left side (was sitting at a corner). The button at one of the ends is useful to call for needed service.  Price: $28.99 I think Soju Split pp: $2.57*3  Overall I think I would go elsewhere.  Oh ps. Also will add that while it was not busy, we were pushed on time by a server telling us it's last call for food."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is delicious! We come all the way from Brampton just for that.  AYCE bbq is alright. The restaurant becomes very hot as there's no AC or fan to ventilate the smoke.   Also, they don't clean the tables well. It's very sticky. I had to grab towels from the washroom to clean it myself. The service is upsetting. Waited 20 mins just to get our order in. Went up to the counter to ask the lady and she literally shooed me away, hand motions and everything. Will never eat here for AYCE bbq but will always come back for pork bone soup takeout."}
{"text":"showed up solo on Wednesday night around 6:30, the place was slow. Wanted to do the AYCE, but they said I would have to pay for two people. Decided to order BBQ a la carte, with a single order they would have cook in back, instead of grilling the meat (BBQ) it was steamed. The meat had no flavor, chewy, and over cooked. ... and the Banchan, they only brought out 3 types, of the 7 types they had (noticed them upon cashing out)"}
{"text":"One of the better KBBQ places in 905 - owned/run by Korean folks.  I had dinner here with family - table of 5. Service was quick and attentive. We did not have AYCE, but we ordered a la carte. The on-the-house starter of lobster congee was delish.   All the meat dishes were really good and authentic. Spice levels were great.  Would definitely return to try more!"}
