{"text":"The bubble tea my friend and I got were sub-par. It was tasted very artificial, and was incredibly sweet. Couldn't tell it was tea. It tasted more like Kool-Aid with tapioca.  The food my friend ordered was outstanding. Will most likely try again in the future."}
{"text":"This place is small and run by a lovely couple that always greet you with a smile. I first came here on a search for bubble tea in mississauga. After reading some positive reviews and already being nearby, I decided to try it. I was not disappointed. The tapioca is always cooked well, and the pricing as well as flavour selection is great. I can't speak about much of the food as I've only had the spring rolls, but they are absolutely delicious and at 3 for $2.75 it's a great deal. I've seen some people get the bahn mi and my god, it looks delicious and I'm determined to visit for food sometime soon. Would highly recommend this place, as the food drinks and service are just lovely :)"}
{"text":"Passed by this place and purchased their bubble tea a couple of times. Very stingy people (we tipped them well too - $5 the first time around on a $20 bill) and not very welcoming (especially the wife). The worst part is that they will charge you as they like; pricing has always been inconsistent. We usually order 3 bubble teas (same toppings/type of drink) and it can range anywhere between $12-$18 in total.  The bubble tea is very powdery and doesn't taste like fruit at all. I think the fact that this is run like a dishonest business turns me off.  Small place with only 2 seating spaces available - takeout recommended."}
{"text":"Bamboo Bubble Tea is more of a take-out kind of bubble tea shop, but I will come here every single time I'm in Mississauga. We come here for one thing: the young coconut smoothie. This smoothie is probably the single most refreshing, delicious and addictive drink I've ever had. I've never been much of a fan of coconut, but this drink is out of this world! Everyone who I know that have tried this can attest to the amazingness of this drink: real coconut (which he will cut fresh while you wait), smoothly blended with ice and milk. We often ask for it without sugar and it's still so delicious.  We also enjoy the cheap banh mis when we're looking for a snack and it's a perfect match with their fresh fruit smoothies.   I love the service, humble but friendly, and they know my face for sure - I'm there almost every week for our 'fix' of young coconut smoothie! They'll be seeing me tomorrow for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite secret bubble joint! Its very inconspicuous from the outside but dont be fooled this place has the best bubble teas in town. Its fresh and I can tell that the couple that works there love what they do. I had the young coconut and red bean bubble tea special. It was delicious!! A perfect marriage of coconut milk with fresh soft red beans mmmmmm. I will definitely return for the banh mi sandwiches. The price is so low but the reviews are great. Stay tuned...."}
{"text":"A total hidden gem. We used to go to Forever Tea House and were so sad to find out it closed when we moved back. This place helps to get over it though :-) We tried lychee as well as mango slush - both r made with real fruit and delish.  our son had a strawberry milk tea with boba.  Squishy, fresh boba and none of that yucky carnation taste (im looking at you, bubble republic). Prices for what u get are a steal hence all round experience 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best banh mi ever had, yes a little more ($0.50 - $1) than the regular viet places, but none of those places takes the time to make sure there is meat and veg in almost every bite end to end, the real young coconut drink is addicting!   Stop reading and go try it now, great small local business serving great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to grab some bubble tea after seeing it's high rating on Yelp.  It is near Chatime but I decided to give it a try.  Now looking back at other reviews, I probably should've tried the Banh Mi instead... The bubble tea was pretty average, but it is powdered based, so that might be a turn off for other people.  One plus is that they have a variety of unique tropical flavours you don't find much at other places.  I ordered a Jackfruit bubble tea for this reason.  I felt it could've used a bit more Jackfruit as it was a little bland, but it was pretty good.   The place is a bit run down, I had to call for someone as everyone was in the back.  This place is definitely a take-and-go kind of joint.  There are two tiny tables, with a few stools.  I'll probably return to try their banh mi, as I just noticed that all the reviews are primarily about their food."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sandwiches and bubble tea. The shredded chicken and BBQ pork sandwiches are the best. They also use real fruit in their bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Like most other reviews on here I'm giving it two thumbs up for the Bahn mi.  Lightly toasted bread and fresh veggies, sliced meats and random spreads make for a delicious snack indeed.   If you're a light weight one bahn mi should be fine.  A more robust appetite would need two.    We also ordered bubble teas.  One mango slush with bubbles and one regular milk tea.  Mango slush was so good.  Very refreshing and easy to drink.  My milk tea however went in the bin unfinished.  It was weak and didn't have the richness a milk tea should.    Next time we'll be ordering mango slushies and more bahn mi's!"}
{"text":"When I came here the first time, I ordered the vegetarian banh mi and absolutely detested it. The peanut sauce lacked flavour, and there were slabs of butter and deep fried batter from the tofu dispersed in my banh mi. That being said, the baguette was well done and impressive. My family loved their respective orders.   I came here a second time with my mother shortly afterward, and although I didn't order this time, I had to bite of her assorted cold cut option. Very flavourful and well worth its value!   Ever since then, I have ordered the assorted cold cut as well. Delicious, though unfortunately, not always hot. Their mango slush is also fantastic and rich in flavours - they use real fruit, and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"At last I ended up at Bamboo bubble Tea, and I am super glad that I did. I was greeted by a very happy and polite lady, I ordered the pork meatball Banh mi.   I asked the lady that if she could make it spicy, she smiled and asked how much can I take?. Right away I knew she meant business, and opted for medium spicy, and boy it was good choice, and it was perfect!  My Bahn mi came out on toasted bun, topped with Cucumber, shredded carrots, cilantro and green chili, and it was fantastic, it really was, I went back again couple of days ago.  This place is Legit when it comes to their Banh mi, the price I don't think anyone can beat them in Mississauga, it is 3.95 with tax I think  Please folks do yourself a favor and treat yourself with the meatball Bahn mi and would be you super glad that you did.  Keep on Yelpin*****  PS. it is a small place, limited seating and no frills ."}
{"text":"So far it's the best Bahn Mi in Mississauga. They also sell pho and other vietnamese food. Their bubble tea is also good. Debit or cash only"}
{"text":"I ordered the banh mi and regular milk tea with tapioca. Banh mi is $2.75 and well worth the price. 5 stars for banh mi. The milk tea bbt however was eh. Did not enjoy it as much as it lacked milk or the creamy taste ? and it was not so sweet. Also the tapiocas were tooo soft. I like the chewy tapiocas like the one from BR or cha time. I would come again for the food, and maybe try a different flavor bbt next time."}
{"text":"So for some weird reason yesterday, I was in the mood for sandwiches and not sushi or Asian food.  I was on a sandwich binge yesterday.  To that end, I also had a craving for something cold and refreshing and just remembered that Stephanie S had posted a review for Bamboo Bubble Tea.    I had always been hesitant to visit this place since it always seemed quiet, but it's been around for at least 6 years so it's got to be okay.  Anyways, since it is relatively close to my house, I decided to visit.  It's a small takeout joint with only two tall tables (though there is room to add a 3rd and 4th). I ordered the BBQ Pork meatball banh mi ($3.25) and the Iced Blended Mango Bubble Tea with tapioca ($5.25+0.50).    How were they?  The bubble tea was very good since it was made with real fruit (I don't like bubble tea unless it's made with real fruit).  When I took my first sip, it actually tasted like mango and not artificial mango powder.  Crazy right?!!!  The only thing that I didn't love about this was that the tapioca wasn't as chewy as I wanted it to be, but the overall flavour was delicious.  4/5.    As for the BBQ Pork meatball banh mi for $3.25, I wasn't expecting much especially considering the lackluster interior.  Colour me red, because I am embarrassed to be so wrong.  This was one of the most delicious banh mi's I've ever had. The meat was savoury and the ingredients were very fresh. Also the ingredients were more than just carrots (*cough* Banh Mi Boys) as it had some lettuce, parsley and turnip/radish.  The bun was warm and toasty and made for a great sandwich.  What is interesting about this banh mi is that it keeps old tradition but also caters more to today's health standards.  Back in the early 90's and late 80's, banh mi's were always cheap, around $0.99 to $1.50 but they were greasy messes.  So yes, $3.25 is 3X that, but there's inflation, however what I like about this banh mi is that it doesn't try to do too much (only 4 or 5 banh mi choices) con-Fusion modern cuisine, but rather it just makes sure that the banh mi's aren't too greasy, uses fresh ingredients which sort of keeps up with today's pace.    Verdict: If you are in the area, skip Subway, and come here instead.  You can get a fresh delicious toasty banh mi sandwich and a large real fruit bubble tea for just over $10 tax in, which is basically the same price (probably less) you will pay for a footlong sandwich with pre-packaged deli and veggies and a lazy fountain drink."}
{"text":"Good place for some Banh Mi to go. Love the Vietnamese meat balls sandwich. There only two locations I go for Banh Mi in Mississauga and here is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"Bubble tea was pretty good, the service was great. The Bahn Mi was surprisingly tasty never expected it to be as good. Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"I was in the area banking today and have been itching for an excuse to come here for lunch. I convinced my mom to come here instead of her regular sit down pho mi.   After reading so many great reviews I decided to order the assorted bahn mi and fresh fruit (mango) bubble tea.   4* for the bubble tea! Fresh, not overly sweet and of course no powders. But it is very expensive compared to Markham for a fresh mango drink.    5*** for the young coconut and red bean special drink. Delicious! My mom asked for no additional sugar and it was still pleasantly sweet. At 5.75 before tax it's expensive but worth every penny. My mom yelled at me for stealing her drink while leaving my half drunken mango behind.   Now for the bahn mi, I'd give it 3 stars at most. The bread was fresh and so was the pickled vegetables no doubt. My problem was too much butter and the meat to bread ratio. We had 1 slice of each deli meat and when eaten with the vegetables and bread you can barely taste the meat. Mississauga China town on Dundas is a little bit more ($.50) but stuffed with meaty goodness.  I also asked for spicy and only 1 bite in the middle of the sandwich had any spice.   We also tried the beef stew with French baguette which was also a let down.  Not salty, not sweet, just tasted like over cooked meat.   I'd definitely go back there for their drinks because I don't like the powder drinks at Starbucks,  bubble tea shops or most smoothie places. Also the owner and workers there are ridiculously friendly and welcoming :) maybe next time I'll try their rice dishes or spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I noticed this place for the first time on the way to dinner tonight and decided to give it a try. It's a tiny store with only 2 tables and 6 chairs. Take-out is recommended for sure.   The first thing I noticed was the price. Bamboo serves Banh Mi ranging from $2.25-3, and Thai/Viet dishes as cheap as $6. The tea prices were impressive as well.   The next thing that caught my eye was most impressive. While I'm not too picky about my bubble tea, there is one feature that always stands out to me - REAL FRUIT! Bamboo offers it for $5.25 in six flavours. I had the lychee.   The open kitchen layout allows you to see the server make your drink while you wait, always a plus. My drink was refreshingly different from other powder-based bubble teas. The lychee flavour was prominent.   Walking in with no expectations at all, I ended up finding what might be my new go-to cheap eats and bubble tea shop."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi in the neighbourhood and way better then the Subway restaurant beside it. Seriously $2.50 for a sandwich. You can't beat it. Grab a bubble tea to wash it down, never go back to Subway ever again! The owners are friendly and service is personal. What more could you ask for..."}
{"text":"Purchased a banh mi sandwich ($2.50 - YES) and a strawberry milk tea. Both taste very fresh and you can smell how fresh the ingredients are! Very good and definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I like the Banh Me (Vietnamese baguette), for me is as good as the one in Vietnam itself. Price is good."}
{"text":"Their bubble teas are not the best, but their banh mi sandwich ($3.25 includes tax) is sooo awesome. I've been going there for the banh mis for 6 years now, still love it"}
{"text":"Bamboo has become my new go to bubble tea place as of last year lol. I've worked at bubble tease as my first job, gone to all the Markham spots (Destiny, Go for Tea etc), all the Mississauga spots (Bubble republic, Chatime etc) and this has become my fave. ALTHOUGH, I do still like Chatime's taro milk tea, but that's a whole different review. This review is for their fresh fruit mango bubble tea and food.  Honestly, once you get a sip of the mango fresh fruit bbt, you are in mango heaven. Anyone that I know that has ever tried this agrees. Even their lychee fresh fruit is so friggin good.  And their spring rolls are sooo good and sooo cheap! I always feel the need to get them when I'm here even if I'm full. Their banh mis are ok. Maybe it was the type I got, but I wasn't TOO crazy about it. Nonetheless, the bbt and spring rolls are still top notch."}
{"text":"AMMMAAAAZING young coconut with red bean bubble tea! The only downside is the price. It's 5.75 + 0.50 for the bubble tea with tapioca, and with tax it come to 7.06. But the drink is SO GOOD. We were wondering if it was worth it, and we all eventually agreed that it really was. Definitely only a once in a while treat, but you have to try it!   All the food options are also relatively cheap in a sense, but they can also be considered expensive for what it is. That might be confusing so let me explain.... For example, most of the reviewers have mentioned that the banh mi is 2.50 so its a steal, but while that may seem like it, you can easily get banh mi in China town for 1.50 so it really isn't that great of a deal. However, you can't find banh mi in the immediate area, so for a quick bite close to home, it's definitely a cheap option.  Anyways, really cute spot in Mississauga! Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"The hours on the door indicated that this place opens at 11:00 AM on Saturdays - we arrived at 11:15 AM, and it was still closed. Not sure if this was an anomaly and the owners were just running late, but take note in case you plan on visiting right when it opens.  We came back later in the afternoon for our bubble tea fix (we didn't order food on this visit), and ordered a Large Mango bubble tea. Overall, the mango flavour was quite fresh, with the flavours really standing out, and I loved that this was made with fresh fruit (allegedly, anyway. We didn't physically see them make our bubble tea in front of us, as they prepared ours in the back).  My only minor complaints would be the price and the texture of the tapioca. Some portions of the tapioca were still frozen and difficult to chew. Also, we were charged a total of $6.50 for one Large Mango bubble tea with tapioca, which we thought was really pricey (compared to Cha Time or other competitors in the area). Otherwise, decent bubble tea."}
{"text":"Bamboo BBT is more of a hidden gem in my honest opinion. Sure it doesn't have much seating or doesn't get too busy like bubble republic...   However when I came here I got great service along with good BBT. I got a large taro milk with tapioca and lychee jelly. Tapioca is now free btw. My BBT came to about $4.50. They also sell Vietnamese/Thai food...more like snacks to be honest. So you can grab a bite to eat with your drinking and chewing on your tapioca. It's a beautiful thing, this BBT phenomenon. Until next time bamboo!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend weren't planning to go here but since Bubble Republic was closed today this was the closest place to get some bubble tea.  The drinks are cheaper here and for some of them they are made with real fruit. The bubble tea drinks here are cheaper than Bubble Republic but it doesn't mean it tastes better. A small costs $2.99 while a large is $3.99. If you want tapioca in yours then it'll be an additional 50 cents. I ordered the taro milk tea and I guess it was alright...not the best. My friend ordered another drink (forgot the flavour) and he said Bubble Republic is better.  If I were to get some bubble tea it won't be at Bamboo Bubble Tea...I'm more of a Bubble Republic person."}
{"text":"The service was great and friendly and my pineapple real fruit smoothy was pretty good. Not the best but above avg. But the plain black milk tea was the worst, most watery milk bubble tea I have ever seen in my entire life. Not sure how they could have even served this to us without shame."}
{"text":"Preface:  This review is based on atmosphere and banh mi alone.    When it comes to bubble tea, I'm a bit particular.  I 1) don't order it often (have you seen the powders that it's made out of??) and 2) when I do, it's usually Ten Ren's, Chatime, or somewhere I know uses brewed tea, fresh fruits as opposed to mixes and other artificial ingredients.  So needless to say, I skipped the bbt and headed straight towards the banh mi portion of the menu!  I've been looking for a place that sells decent Viet sandwiches in the city for a while now.  The regular assorted meat banh mi was $2.50 - NO JOKE!  This is a steal...errr, I mean DEAL.  Baguette was fresh, so were the ingredients.  It was literally my dinner before I had to boot it to the office.  The only thing that I didn't quite like was that unlike many banh mi places, the ingredients weren't displayed in the front, behind the glass counter.  Instead, the sandwich was prepared somewhere in the back.  And I would've preferred to see all the ingredient in front of me.  Other than that, I'll be stopping by more often for my cheap eats!  Primarily take-out as per the 2 small tables."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea ! The strawberry young coconut is awesome. Very good service as well."}
{"text":"2 times I've tried to visit this place during lunch period only to find it being closed once I got there.  Did they run out of bread or something or do they just make up their own hours?  I peered my head through the window only to see the worker waving their hand and shaking their head doing the universal sign to say \"we are closed!\"  During lunch period???? Time wasted and frustrated. I'll keep this at a 2 star for now. If you do decide to visit this olace, I would suggest to call before you leave your door!"}
{"text":"Just okay.  We love our bubble tea but this one is just okay.  The place itself doesn't look very clean or appealing in any way. But we decided to try anyway since they were open late and we were already there.  I ordered the real fruit strawberry with strawberry jelly.  No real fruit was used which was highly disappointing and misleading. Tasted like the powder strawberry. It wasn't bad, but still not at all what was advertised or expected.  The jelly was standard jelly. Not too much in the cup however.  Probably won't be back to be honest. Not really worth it compared to other places in the area."}
{"text":"been here a lot, but the recent trip is my last trip. i have collected the stamps for a free small bubble tea, and when i went to claim it, they said that it is only going to take 3 dollars off, and charged for the tapioca (which was always free). i asked why they charged for the tapioca suddenly, and they replied \"nothing is free\". they changed the rules on the whim, not even notifying the customers. never coming back"}
