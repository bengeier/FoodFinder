{"text":"I was here in 2012 and I swear that I will not ever come back again.  My friend lives near by said they make a quantum leap on food quality so I decided to give it another try.  It was a 1 star restaurant but now it's a 2 star.  100% improvement!!!!    Back to the food, quality is decent but can't compare to any good pho places.  The large would be at most a medium at other places.  Nothing special about the pho, it is really average at most.  The texture of the noodle is not as chewy, soup base is plain and the meat quality is average.  It's $8 + $2 for a large so no value at all.  I might say spoon and fork next door might be a slightly better experience.  In other words this is not the daily pho joint but a quick pho fix if necessary.  If you need a decent decor restaurant with English speaking waitress that might be decent looking, this is the place for you.  There is not much more to this place, I probably won't come back for another couple years."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to explain how TERRIBLE this restaurant is...The food is okay but the service is beyond rude and unorganized. On two occasion, after waiting for more than an hour, I call the restaurant:  \"OOPS, we forgot to fill out your order.\"   Even though, they acknowledge receiving the order...One time was acceptable...So we ordered again...but now that this error has happened more than once, this review must be written. They do not deserve your business."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a picky eater when it comes to vietnamese food, but I'm going to come right out and say that this wasn't my favourite pho spot.   The noodles were slightly under cooked, and the soup base was overly salty.  However, I will commend the restaurant on its clean decor, and appetizers. The spicy basil calamari and grilled skewers (specifically the beef and chicken) were delicious, and the complimentary taro chips that you get after ordering are a perfect snack to munch on while waiting for your food to arrive.   WonderPho is a bit short of being wonderful in my books, but it'll do for a quick fix in the area."}
{"text":"This is actually a review from my boyfriend who has only a few asks when it comes to pho:  1. Decent qualify beef and; 2. Broth that is broth, not just salty water.  He went out to eat here with a friend and was immediately unimpressed with the interior decor. While it's a beautiful restaurant, he has the theory that the more the chef can't cook a decent pho, the more the restaurant compensates with the interior design.  Totally true. The bowl of pho he had had meat that was riddled with fat, so much so that he felt the need to stick his fingers into his bowl, fish out the meat, and discard half of it.  The noodles were obviously cooked and left int he bowl way before any broth was added, and had congealed into a solid, carby lump. He even swears the garnishings were stingy.  This is coming from a guy who's not a picky eater.  He did complain to the staff about his meal, and then when asked to pay for the full price of his pho with more than half of it hardly even touched, he asked to see the manager. He suggested ways to FIX the soup, because if this is what they're serving to others, they're obviously going to run out of business. I agree when I would expect even a slight discount, or a re-make of the dish if it was so obviously bad, but the manager refused to even listen to the complaints. My boyfriend now refuses to come to this place, as do all his friends who live in the area."}
{"text":"Wintertime-falltime is the best time for hot liquids with floating meat bits. I bring you WonderPho! Hot soup with a side of bad pun. The best kind.  We were hungry. The DVP was a mass of tail lights. Comforting food required. We declined sushi (the healthy choice) and went for comfort. Mmm mmm meaty noodley comfort.  ATMOSPHERE  Clean and modern, with bright yet inoffensive lighting and a professional approach to your dining experience ie not a craphole where they wiped the table two days ago with a dirty cloth and the staff are juggling 15 tables and just want you to snorkle in your bowl, leave exact change and GTFU. Anyway, modern decor  with lots of squares and flat colour and soothing bamboo.   Good for: Our group of four lovely ladies, possibly 6 Low-key date Eating, natch  FOOD  I love me my noodles, especially intestines. I ordered my favourite seafood dish (no glass noodles arg) and was pleasantly surprised at the presence of tasty mussels, whitefish and plump shrimp as opposed to fake crab and a few rubbery nuggets of Ursula. It was pleasantly spicy as well, which was nice but saltier than I prefer (sneaky hot sauce!). Since the soup didn't come with tripe, I ordered some thrown in as well, which they did for no extra charge. The seafood was a reasonable price too, which was great, at just over $11.  Another pleasant surprise was my pal's vegetarian bitter melon broth soup. Because what is pho without meaty bits? Crap that's what, all the flavour comes from the meat. Sorry vegetarians. But the broth was very good, and not too salty either. She said it didn't fill her up much, and it had two lonely pieces of tofu, which is a poor show, but still, they deserve some kudos on the broth alone.  SERVICE   Unlike Go For Tea, where people hang out under ridiculously crazy yet dim lamps and the server deigns to give you your hot sauce after a half hour, you are actually encouraged to have a meal here. The food was quick and the server was nice. Nothing else to say, it was good.  LOCATION  When I don't drive, I can't find anything on my own. It was in York Mills somewhere, so not that far, Markhamites. The plaza was rather pleasant. The Fox and the Fiddle looked good too, if you felt the need to chase your tripe with a shot of banana liqueur or a pint of M. Yeah ew.  OVERALL  Good pho, nice enough to bring your mother for a chill family date, good service. If you're in the area and noodling for some noodles, make a stop!"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious food! I loved the portions. I had a regular pho the first time I came and a curry pho the secone time. Both are very delicious! The interior is great too! It's quite nice"}
{"text":"I was lucky to find this place across the Westin Prince which I have stayed for a business trip. I loved the play on the name. How cute! It was a bit pricy comparing to the phos that I was used to either in SF Bay Area or NYC. But the soup was good. Unless you are super ambitious, getting a normal bowl should suffice."}
{"text":"Wonderpho is truly wonderful! I live literally 5 mins from the restaurant and am really excited to have this pop up in our community.   I came here on a Thursday night. We ordered a pho and a curry beef dish - both were amazing! The food was fresh and the taste was spot-on.   The decor was pleasant and the service was attentive - nothing too fancy but way better than your typical pho house. The place is also quite reasonably priced. I remember the regular pho being around $6-$7. I'll definitely be back again very soon..."}
{"text":"We went for their 3-5pm special and ordered 2 pho.  We had 1 child pho too.  What do they do?  take off the child pho $6 from the bill.  I said to them that the child's pho is $6 all the time, so if it is 2 for 1 pho, is it not the regular pho???  Nooooo way they said.  To add insult to injury, they have the nerve to add a service charge for their nonsense!!!  No wonder they are closing down as of tomorrow.  Good riddance.  Goodbye."}
{"text":"My meal was good, but the staff mixed up an order at our table, and the response was \"I know.\" And that was after requesting it be corrected. My dish was right, but the service standards I saw were poor at best. Can't comment on the pho, I had the com.  Also fix your website, it says it's open until 10:30pm an Saturday. Closed at 10."}
{"text":"I think this place is improving. The service was just fine.  The prices were a bit high but we usually hit up less \"fancy\" pho places and spots with more competition.  I thought the broth was very flavorful. Large bowls very large. Food came fast.   Veggie spring rolls lacking something. Can't put my finger on it.  Biggest disappointment: they charge about $2/person for tea. Seems like a cash grab to me.   Hop-Pho-ly the will continue to improve."}
{"text":"This place is your average Pho restaurant, with your typical soup bowl and meat dishes served. The food quality is okay, as your typical dishes like Pho with beef brisket and beef balls have bland and decent flavouring. It's not bad or unappetizing, but its nothing out of the norm in terms of typical Viet cuisine. With the food being just average, you would expect the prices to be affordable, but in comparison with over Pho restaurants in Toronto, this place is quite pricey for what your paying for, which is soup noodles with grocery frozen beef brisket and balls.  The restaurant itself is clean and spacious and decorated well, however the food quality is just average and nothing to be thrilled over. I would only recommend this place if you want to eat Pho, and your close by."}
{"text":"Best pho I have ever had!  The basil, sprouts and chilis they give you are very fresh, and the broth and noodles are delicious! (I find many pho places have a strange after taste in the pho broth, but at this place, it was perfect!).  Service was good, and I would say it could be improved if the menu selection was a little broader."}
{"text":"Definitely PittyPho   I've been have crazy cravings for Pho for lunch for a few weeks at work and there are none to be found close by.  All of a sudden all these restaurants popped up. After try this place. It should have been the last of the new places we tried.. haha  Nothing really exciting about the food here & I can't believe you have to ask for tripe to be added to your Pho for an extra $2.00 for 3 small strips of tripe. DAMN, at Dimsum for $2.00 I get a steamed dish of 8-10 pieces LoL.  ...and trust me on this one, Fresh fruit shakes cannot be \"their famous fan favorites\" haha  The crappy Pho restaurants in RIchmond Hill taste better than this joint boys and girls.  I did not give this place a 1 star because it did satisfy my pho craving, but next time I'll just wait till after work and head up to Richmond Hill to get my fix"}
{"text":"The pho here is edible but not the greatest tasting.  It is also relatively expensive for pho (probably because of location).  The upside is the servers were nice and its relatively close to where I live."}
{"text":"I should've read my fellow yelper's reviews before coming here. I was quite disappointed with their pho. I don't want to pile on the hate for their pho but unless they make changes and improve on it, they won't find me coming back. The atmosphere is nice, decor makes you feel comfortable and the wait staff was excellent. Just their staple dish needs some major work."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant every once in a while since it opened. We've always experienced pretty bad service, but the soup was good. It seems that every time we went (maybe once every 6 weeks or so), the decor was different, and the menu was different. For a while they served Taro chips as a free app, and they had lime in their water. That disappeared quickly. The curry soup base was always aromatic, but today, the curry was basically salty water with chicken stock. My mushrooms were really acidic and off putting. There were 3 servers there and only about 4 tables were filled. Nobody came to check on us. My husband didn't get a lime slice, and he didn't have many bean sprouts or basil for his soup. My soup was luke warm. We hardly ate anything. When the server finally came over, I asked when they changed their curry soup base. He didn't know what I was talking about. I complained about the mushrooms and the service. He spoke with someone and they offered us points on some card they wanted us to sign up for, in order to get a free soup next time. Next time? No thank you. He also said he was on his break, so he couldn't come to check on us. Seriously? There were 2 other servers there doing nothing! They didn't offer anything to compensate our dissatisfaction, and no manager came over to deal with the problem. After reading the \"not-recommended\" reviews on Yelp, I'm confident that our decision not to return is the right one."}
{"text":"1 star for the cleanliness and decor 1 star for service  1 star deduction for being expensive (for pho) 1 star deduction for disappointing starters (mango avocado and calamari) 1 star deduction for being TOO SALTY...   I had to drink 2 bottles of water after the meal and still couldn't recover."}
{"text":"Went: 5:30 pm Fri May 15 2015 Ordered: pho Cost: incl. tax and tip $20 I liked that you can customize your choice of Pho here, being able to select your type of noodles, meat and soup base.  We selected glass noodle, with Sa Te soup base, plus beef as protein.  However, the pho here was nothing out of the ordinary. The portion size was decent. It's a quiet place and the service was very attentive.  I've been to a lot of pho places. Even the best pho doesn't really inspire me to me give 4.0 out of 5.0 stars. Good pho is 3.5 and that is what this place was. Bottom line: I can get pho in a lot of places so I would not come back for this pho. This is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Been here twice seeing as my office is next door. Most recent experience was awful, first was not memorable either. This time the restaurant smelled strongly of sewage, so much that if i was not with co-workers I would've walked out. Disgusting.   I ordered the vegetarian pho which was served with 2- yes only 2- pieces of tofu. Broth was flavourless and lukewarm. Will not be returning. For a better vietnamese experience try Pho Saigon."}
{"text":"The Pho quantity and quality was good, no issues, but the broth was heavily onion-accented.  I'm all okay for a bit of onion flavouring, but i was tasting french onion soup, not Pho in the broth.  I prefer my onions as a garnishment.  For the overpowering broth, you get only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed by the overall service and quality of the food. We (group of 2) went there around 8:30pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant wasn't very busy. There was no one to greet us at the door and no employee even looked at us so we just found a table and sat down. Waited there for over 10 minutes and nobody bothered to bring us menus despite walking by our table many times. I ordered a beef pho which wasn't very tasty. Everything was pretty average and the broth was mostly salty without any real beef flavour. In a city full of great restaurants, this place won't stay open for long."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not disgusting, though I've had plenty better.  In just writing this review because we fought through traffic to make it for their before 6pm half price specials - we had a couple minutes to spare and asked to order soon as we got in the door and they said we couldn't get it.   And so they lost our business.    I was really rooting for them because they're relatively local to me and the area could use the renewal, but o won't be back for a while"}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favour and don't go here. Food was actually ok, but service is extremely bad. Servers are not assigned tables and servers do not communicate with each other, so nobody knows what's going on. They are trying to run this restaurant with western service and western pricing, but you are waaay better off going to your typical dive Chinese-run pho joint. You'll get faster service and better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would have to say that WonderPho is pretty WonderPho... haha get it? *lame*  So this place is located in a very unexpected location... Don Mills and York Mills. Away from all the competition. The plaza where it is located consist of Menchies, Fox in the Fiddle, Galleria and Dragon Pearl Buffet. So coming on the wrong day can render you into a traffic jam in the parking lot.  When I first walk in to WonderPho I found the atmosphere very modern and cool. It's definitely not your typical viet/pho restaurant in the west end of Toronto. They definitely target the more middle to upper class group, especially since there are a lot of office buildings around its location.   The placemat is the menu and the selections are simple and concise, unlike the pages of items other places have. Upon being seated you get served water, a basket of taro chips and a cute waitress to go along with it. The staff are very nice, young and hip making the experience more related to my type of feel.   The food is very good here. Not traditional but they definitely carry their own style. The pho portions are big. The broth is just right (in my opinion) and they provide lots of toppings to go with it. They definitely don't chince you out on the amount of beef in your pho. They provide options to add extra items for a few bucks more. Price-wise, it is very pricey. A bowl of pho regular size is around $9. Add $2 and you have yourself a large size, in otherwords a meal for 2. The ice vietnamese coffee (Ca Phe Sua Da), is $3 and they doing it the traditional way with the dripping filter. I hate places that serve it through an espresso machine.  Would I recommend this place? If you have a few extra dollars to spare and don't feel like going out of the North York area then i would definitely come back.  I dare someone to do the Pho Challenge at WonderPho. I asked about it and they told me 15 attempts and only 1 completed it. Here are more details about it - http://www.wonderpho.ca/pho-challenge.html"}
{"text":"my favourite pho spot. if you love watching basketball they have a giant tv in the middle with basketball happening no matter what time of the day you come by. the water it served in this cool bottle and if you order pho after 2pm you can get the other *half off or *free (not sure which one) the grilled baby squid it pretty good as well the sauce they serve you go with it is just incredible.  my favourite of the phos they serve is the pho tai sa te and i order it with all the free addons such as baby sprouts, basil, and many more stuff. The noodles comes standard with rice noodles but you also have the options of getting other types of noodles as well. The broth isnt too salty its just right but i do find myself adding the extra slice of lime and a dash of the chilli paste thats on the table.  the service is all very good, the food comes in very quickly but sometimes I've had the case where my grilled squid appetizer came in after the main dish but it guess it all depends on what you order. All the people that work are all young people looks like there all in uni or something."}
{"text":"I rated this 5 so that this comment be posted. Yesterday, my boyfriend  and I tried this place for lunch. I ordered  avocado smoothie and the waitress brought mango smoothie....I ordered pork spring rolls and they brought vegetable spring rolls. The soup was right but there were no small bowls for us to use from the big bowl of soup. when I asked for extra bowl and fork the waitress was irritated and sarcastically asked if theres anything else...Not a good experience....Never come back....Ive had way better experience in other locations..."}
{"text":"Wonderpho...ahh haa, I get it...  If this restaurant fails, it's the complete fault of the owner. Why the hell would anyone open a Vietnamese noodle eatery here? The business solely depends on the few urban sprawl offices and one business building at the corner. Did I just answer my own question?  Cleanest Pho restaurant in Toronto (front of house anyway), it better be because the place looked like a section of Sunnybrook Hospital. It's got hospital colours, and even tin pottery. They totally sell those at Sunnybrook.  So we got bamboo, vases. This feel more like a gift shop than a restaurant. It does have a patio, but who eats pho on a patio?  You know that zesty flavour in the soup? Well, the pho here has too much of that. Tastes unnatural, tastes like packaged spices rather than fresh ones. Either that or too much MSG. I can definitely taste the taste of cutting corners. The lemongrass chicken breast wasn't outstanding either, not tender enough. I think it was called the Chicken Com. Frozen meat that's been in the freezer for too long, not enough flavour, that's what it tasted like. I would like to see the chef and inspect the kitchen. But really I don't.  The waitresses here are quite nice, one of them has a blonde streak at the ponytail. Not that's it's important, or any way relevant, but it's what I've noticed so I thought I write this down. I'm so bored, and there's nothing to do here. The place was nearly empty, and the food here isn't fresh. The plate of sprouts was old, and they only gave me one plate, despite that there were two of us and we both ordered pho. You kidding me? It's bean sprouts! Should we share napkins too? I did notice that they had a bunch of selection in the pho area, different kinds of soup base with different noodles. Perhaps this was their selling point. I'm still bored.  I'm being hard on this place because the borderline theme-park of a restaurant is just around the corner (Dragon Pearl). This place needs to offer some kind of niche.  I just can't imagine why I would want to come back here. Spend some time in getting fresh ingredients, not so much time in coming up with the clever name.  Oh, and I ordered the apple juice.  It was from concentrate...."}
{"text":"Food: 2* Price: 2* Service: 2*  Glad they're closed, but since their blog (https://www.wonderpho.ca/index.html) mentions that \"?In coming [sic] to this space will be something fun, exciting and delicious\", I thought I'd post a review anyway, in case the new establishment that they open is just as ho-hum.  The pho here was bland and pricey for the serving, but I guess that's what you get for North York, with no other Vietnamese places in close proximity for competition. The vermicelli dishes were just mediocre and again, not that generous in size.  Other than the pho price, the smoothie price irked us because it was one amount on the menu, but when my price-conscious dinner companion confirmed that that was the price, the server increased it, saying, \"Oh, that's just the price for the kids' size.\" So how would anyone have known this, if they didn't confirm first with their server specifically, which I would assume would be the case most of the time.  The servers were not Vietnamese (both women kept calling the soup \"po\") and they couldn't answer simple questions. When we asked several times--and slowly--if they had \"banh xeo\", they kept pointing to the menu and saying, \"'Basil'? Yeah, it's in that dish\" or \"Basil? It's a herb.\" We explained that it's a type of Vietnamese pancake or crêpe, and they said, \"Oh, we don't serve breakfast here.\" Ha.  Did it give me food poisoning? No. But was it a good experience? No. Overall, I'm glad that WonderPho isn't around anymore to claim that it's wonderful."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are so harsh. I came here the first week it opened, and yes they had some issues getting the flow of the restaurant under control. But they just opened, so cut them some slack and just focus on reviewing the food.  The second time I went the service was so much better.  I got: 1) The beef brisket curry - this is amazing! A little too spicy for my taste but the flavours are all there and they give you a give bowl of curry for the rice.  2) Beef Pho - tastes very home-style. It's not as salty as other pho restaurants and the sprouts/chillis/lime are really fresh.  3) Shrimp Spring Rolls  - yummy! The texture is great, I like the clear crispy wrap compared to the yellow ones you get at other pho restaurants. Doesn't feel like you are eating fried frozen pre-made ones these taste fresh.  I'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Noodles were stuck in a knot that could not be untangled by chop sticks. Rare beef was well done and also balled up it's own sticky knot. Basil was skimpy.  No other greens served.   Broth was bland. Room was very echo filled . Pork spring rolls were okay but a bit bland.   Service was very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It doesn't stand out for me as particularly special amongst vietnamese places, but it's solid, good Pho, reasonable prices, service is decent, there are no long line-ups at lunch. Basically, it's fine."}
{"text":"Summary: Overpriced pho with decent noodles and ok broth. But the Seafood Pho was terrible. Definitely do not get that. I'd stick with the Beef broth based Pho, or a curry base.  The review: Any Pho place with nice decor is automatically suspect in my books. The better pho I've had has usually been at dives and places where you make sure you wipe down your utensils before using them. So walking into WonderPho alarms immediately went off.  I came here without reading any Yelp reviews, and after reading them now, my experience was similar.   More expensive than other places, and cruddy service (we were the ONLY table there, yet the waiter didn't come by once during our meal to check up on us. I had to call him over i.e. yell, to get more water).    I ordered the Seafood Pho. DO NOT GET IT.  It's one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get two mussels, two pieces of fake crab, two tiny shrimps, and two tiny pieces of overcooked squid.  Definitely get one the beef base Pho or Curry dishes.  The positives are that the noodles themselves were actually decent, and from what I could tell of my friend's beef broth and curry broths, those were ok as well. The base isn't quite as oily as other Pho places, which is good or bad, depending how you look at it.   Based on the seafood Pho alone, there's much better Pho to be had. And with plenty of options in that area (Dragon Pearl, a thai and japanese buffet next door, kelseys, coras, pizza, wings, freshi, etc.) unless you're craving Pho, I'd go somewhere else.  If I do end up coming again, I'll be sure to try a Rare Beef Pho (i.e. a 101 at most places) to compare the staple and report back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since you left me I didn't mean to, make you cry I didn't mean to, disappoint you I didn't mean to, tell you lies And after all that, we have been through Won't you let me, tell you why One more try I didn't know how much, I loved you One more try Let me put my, arms around you Living all these lonely nights without you Oh baby can we give it, one more try  Since Wonderpho has decided to \"relaunch\" today and offer free Pho, I thought I'd give it one more try.  We ordered some pork summer rolls and a mango salad.  We counted several slivers on the mango salad (see picture yourself) but the pork roll was pretty good.  The Pho on the other hand, lots of msg and is not the traditional Pho you would get at a Viet Pho place.  They gave us a plate full of old bean sprouts and a small sprig of mint for 3 to share.  Overall way below what I get at Pho dives.   At least the service was 10X better than last, but that's not saying very much (see previous review)  I really really want to like you WonderPho, but maybe it's just me not you.. Aww heck.. it's you baby not me.  No more tries."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go to spots to get pho in Toronto. The BOGO deal is a great deal and the pho tastes good but nothing spectacular.  That's when I no longer have anything good to say about this establishment.  During my most recent and last visit, I had an awful experience here. Me and my friends ordered two large and medium phos here during the 3-5 BOGO time. We informed the waitress that we were pairing the large phos together for the deal as for the mediums as well.   When we completed the meal, we proceeded to ask for the bill. As it arrived, we were surprised to see that they charged us for two large phos while giving us the medium phos for free.   We told the boss that this was a mistake and that we informed the waitress about how we wanted the meal split and she ensured us all would be fine. The boss didn't seem to care about what we had to say and told us that they don't split orders like that as it states on their policy.  Although he says this, me and my friends have had no problems the dozens of times we've ordered here in previous visits.   As the argument evolved, I asked to see a physical copy of this policy but the supervisor said they simply did not have one.   We refused to pay this bill and this resulted to him calling the security to come solve the situation. When the security guard arrived, he simply stood there and did nothing.   Clearly he had no clue as to what to do in the situation because he knew the restaurant owner was in the wrong. We ended up having to wait several minutes for the restaurant owner to call 911 in an attempt to make us pay for the faulty bill. We explained the predicament to the police on the phone and they simply told us it was up to us to deal with it.  After several more minutes of trying to explain the error to the stubborn owner, he finally decided to change the bill to how it was supposed to be.   We wasted over 30 minutes on this and because of that, I will never come here again.  The saddest part of this situation is that the restaurant ended up receiving less money on our order because of this dispute as we did not leave a tip after this horrendous experience."}
{"text":"I am new to Pho, but now I'm sadly aware of what I had been missing. Delicious food, for resonible prices. Can't go wrong. Shrimp paste on sugar cane sounds strange at first, but wait until you try it."}
{"text":"I had pho with brisket, beef, and meat balls. The soup and the quality of the meat was very good. I found the portion size very reasonable too.  Service was alright - they mixed up an order but didn't make a fuss about switching it for the correct one. The only thing I didn't like was that they do not serve any hot tea unless you buy it - basically forcing you to buy a drink."}
{"text":"If you want good pho, don't come here.  Go to an authentic vietnamese restaurant (the staff is not vietnamese).  The restaurant at least looks nice, but the pho broth is rather strange, and on the pricey side."}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible. I kind of liked it. It's a good cheap option if you're in the area, not necessarily the best restaurant pick in this area, and I wouldn't make a trip here, but the rest of the restos in these two plazas are equally mediocre as well.   It was 2pm on a weekday afternoon, and it wasn't busy at all. The atmosphere in here is kind of nice, and good for a catch up lunch, or a party of one with a book. It's not gross at all, and I felt comfy just me and my noodles and a book.   I got the Curry Pho because it was something different. I do have to say that the broth is heavily MSG'd and I can taste it in my mouth still about 3 hours later. I never knew how to tell if it was msg or just flavour, but after having some excellent ramen yesterday i can def. say that , that place had very little or no MSG compared to here.   It was spicy. But I liked it. Not your typical Pho, and portion size was okay. It seems bigger than it looks with a high soup to noodle ratio - but content wise, was filling. ($8.99)  There's other viet dishes on the menu which looks really tasty.  I'd come back in the area. Actually I'd prefer to sit in here, than in Artisano next soor for some reason.   The service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Got their shrimp spring rolls. $6 for 3 pieces. The 3 pieces were the two bite brownie equivalent of spring rolls. Not cool. They tasted fine, but for that price, I'm expecting a whole lot more shrimp and a much larger portion.  One star for their regular pho that is more sized like a large pho. Didn't taste it. Can't comment on that.  Close by, so I might come if I'm desperate for pho, but never again for spring rolls."}
{"text":"The soup probably came out of a can. Meat portions were small. Won't be back. Too pricey for a pho restaurant"}
{"text":"I'll say right out I'm not a fan of overly salty, MSG laden Asian food - and I AM ASIAN.  If that is your benchmark for what constitutes a tasty Asian meal then WonderPho is not the place for you.  OTOH if you lean more towards the subtle the food here will satisfy you.  One of the few places you can eat where MSG is not added by the ladle full during preparation.  Service is friendly, atmosphere comfortable, establishment clean."}
{"text":"First pho ive ever had that doesnt use chinese 5 spice to flavor their broth. Tasted like Campbell chicken soup. When I asked the waiter if they used the spices in my batch he didnt know what chinese 5 spice was. If you are looking for very overpriced Campbells chicken soup then this is your spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because I support my fellow Viets....but it was meh.  The menu looked very promising but when we got everything it all lacked taste.  I so want to like you but there was one thing I did find that I liked...  a picture that said \"Keep Calm and PHO get about it\"  classic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Although Toronto doesn't boast a place with a name like \"Pho Sizzle,\" it does have one called WonderPho. (These puns only work if you're not a stickler for proper Viet pronunciations--not something you want to get into.)  With a spacious and clean, contemporary decor, this is pretty much the only place for Vietnamese cuisine in this uneventful part of town that has a growing but limited selection of restaurants clustered together, catering mainly to the hoards of office workers that work in the area. When it first opened, service was downright pathetic and a mess. But it has since improved to a level more or less acceptable at best--except if you sit outside in the front patio, where service drops to non-existent. They can be bloody slow to issue the bill. Worse is that some tables are not provided with chopsticks--I should not have to ask for chopsticks at an Asian restaurant, for fuck's sakes!  If you're just craving a quick bowl of pho, it is pricier than what you can get downtown for a damn big bowl ($8-11 vs. $4-7?!). What makes WonderPho stand out is that besides offering the stuff in the usual beef (pho bo) and chicken (pho ga) broths, they also make it in unconventional soups, like curry or tom yum. You can even choose your type of noodles. Sounds almost like a ramen noodle house.  The noodle meals are often heavy on the broth. The curry pho though, it's an interesting spin at first glance--imagine eating pho with the characteristic spicy aroma of curry mixed in. But it will have you sweating buckets and sometimes reeking of an MSG aftertaste. It's probably the only thing worth here trying for adventure's sakes, for many of their other staple offerings, like their spring rolls, aren't great.  Overall, for a place that calls itself \"wonderpho,\" it sadly does not quite live up to its name.  {TTC: any 95 bus to Lesmill or Upjohn Road. There are plenty of parking in the plaza premises, including beside the Galleria Korean supermarket on the other end of the building. Feel free to get some kimchi there and then chuck some in your meal here.}"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here a while back.  Nice, friendly, eye candy typed waitress greeted us at the door. Let's hope the food is as good as she looks.  30 minutes later, nope - one out of two.  Pho was a bit on the pricier side for what it was.  Broth was too salty, and heavy on the MSG side. The slices of beef soaked up the broth so it too was salty. I remember not feeling well several hours after.  Did I mention the broth was overly oily and greasy too? At least they used the correct pho noodles, not the thick kind you sometimes find at other places.  Friend ordered deep fried spring rolls as an app which was very soggy with oil when it came to our table.  Over a span of 10 minutes, a small pool of oil had collected at the bottom of the basket the spring rolls were served on. Very gross and disheartening. We didn't eat all of it and left the entire roll as is.  The decor was nice, wooden panelled accent were used on the booths, clean tiled floors.  It had a lounge, modern deco feel. I really wanted to like this place, but too bad the food didn't stand up well.  Ah well, at least they had nice looking waitresses?"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, tasty. The pho is hot and the broth is tasty. They do have new specials for each day. I always get a large Pho Bo #6. Never tried anything else. Don't really need to. I will sometimes add on a non-fried shredded pork spring roll. They also have some good hot tea as well. What I like about here is that when you ask for ice water, the water comes out of a pitcher that has lemons inside so you get some lemon flavor as well. This place is close to where I live so I come by quite a bit."}
{"text":"Had a craving for pho and was starving.  This was the closest one to my home.  Not bad, not fantastic. Our server was very nice. The only disappointment I had was the price. I found it to be overly expensive for just pho. But I'm originallly from downtown so I guess you can only get great pho with cheap prices in Chinatown or Markham?    Overall a good experience and the pho was not salty.  I think previous reviews state they don't use MSG, which I like.   We also had the pork spring rolls which were decent and I would order them again. I also liked that they have tendons in their pho. Yum!   They have BOGO during the week 3-5pm. Definitely will take advantage of it."}
{"text":"I love the variety of soup base!  1. Choose soup base 2. Choose meat 3. Choose noodles  It's nice not to have this extra thick complicated menu of variations when you can make your own combination.  I also tried the pork meatball Bah Mi sandwich. Tasty, but I think I've had better. What would make it better is to GRILL the pork meatballs. Deep fried pork ball texture doesn't go with the rest of the sandwich.  The thai iced tea was tasty, but most will likely want more syrup in it.  I'll be coming back for more Pho!  I also noticed a Buy-one-get-one free pho noodle special between 3 pm-5 pm. Linner anyone?  This place is not like traditional Pho places...so don't expect conventional Vietnamese restaurant staples."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cute and Romantic, they have little wired lightbulbs hung on the ceilings, creates an intimate ambience. Definitely, a great place for dates, group hang out.  Food: I ordered the assorted pho, whats different about their broth is that they also add fried shallots to it. i usually love love love fried shallots, but for some reason, it confuses the pho flavouring. Besides that, everything is fresh and delicious.   Overall: Definitely will be back, not the BEST of pho, but for a cute date."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I have on my Pho list of restaurants! I love this pho because they allow me to customize my Pho in all the ways I want, from the broth type, to noodle and content. They also have white chicken breast, good quality vegetable (including mushroom that taste like a piece of meat). Also, they have a kid's meal (only Pho restaurant that I have found so far with that option) that has the perfect soup size for my 8 year old son!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was top notch. Overall a good experience at wonderPho. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Update: I've stopped going to Wonder Pho back in March after a sudden change of politics in the kitchen. For that I also remove 2.5 stars. Since then I've been falling in love with another Vietnamese restaurant, for which I will write a review soon."}
{"text":"I went against Yelp people's advice and tried this place yesterday.  The food was great.  Their Pho was really good.  I was surprise from all the bad reviews.  Their Avocado smoothies were fresh.  Their soup base was actually good but just needed to be a little hotter-lost a star here.   Their spring rolls was really hot and tasted great.  The food was fast and the meat and tendon was soft.  Their price is a little higher than other pho places -lost another star, but I was surprise how good the food was here.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been this restaurant  since they opened.  I like thier clean modern interior which is different than other Vietnamese restaurant. I found it the food is fresh because my go to menu is Mango Salad and seafood noodle( Pho Ha San) so I can easily sense it's fresh or not.  The pho tastes dainty to me .  I just love that spicy sour seafood soup.  I sometimes bring my friends , they all liked it too.  They have kid's pho which is new so I can bring my son with no probs now.  I often had super thirsty feeling after I had pho, but this place wasn't give me that much dry thirst."}
{"text":"Food is very bland - not authentic at all.  meant to cater to the customers who have never eaten Vietnamese food before.  Definitely will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Luckily we stumbled in here just before 3pm. The server informed us of the BOGO free pho from 3-5 pm. Sweet deal!  Pho broth was flavorful and tasted just like homemade and the free pho was even better ;)!  Also tried their mango smoothie...it was absolutely delicious. Nothing but fresh mangoes puréed to a fine smooth consistency, served in a mason jar, which was a nice touch. It was so good that I came back the next day and ordered a to go smoothie. Yum!"}
{"text":"On the pricier side of pho places and they no longer take credit card but the Pho Sate is pure crack. I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"This has become our \"go-to\" place when we want something tasty and simple without spending too much. The pho is tasty, and the broth is always hot (which is not always the case elsewhere).  We are always happy with the service we get as well and this is big since it is rare to find good service at Vietnamese joints. I heartily recommend this if you're ever in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The pho was made simple and delicious. The grilled chicken was in generous portions and was mouth watering good. The interior is clean and aesthetically pleasing. Love that the menu composed of fewer items than other pho restaurants which made it easy to order. Great service as well, very attentive staff. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pho here. I always get the #6.  The broth is very flavourful and the staff very nice.  The ambience is crisp and clean.  I know I know, the best pho places look uh questionable but have the best pho.  This place is the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Phone and was in the area, went in and was seated immediately.  The decor is very nice, has a nice big screen at the back of the restaurant showing news and a good mix of music.  The menu is very simple to read from and ordered the Pho Bo, as much as I was starving, the Pho challenge was definitely not on the map (1.5 lbs of noodle, 1 lb of meat and lots of soup - 3+ liters).  I wimped out and settled with the large. I had trouble finishing that!  The rare beef was good, the brisket was thick cut and oh so yummy. The tendon was perfectly cooked and the beef balls were the highlight!  The soup was nice and hit the spot.  I would definitely come back as the food is great and service was top notch!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for lunch for a group of 5, but when we arrived, we were made to wait and another group that didn't have a reservation was seated beforehand.  Also, I had a receipt from a visit 6 days earlier and was told on my prior visit that I would receive a free appetizer if I brought my receipt within 7 days.  When I brought it and tried to redeem it this visit, they said try stopped the offer...not impressed since we were already made to wait.  Besides the service issue, a few of my friends found the pho overly salty. I enjoyed the yellow curry pho but agreed it was a bit salty as well."}
{"text":"I decide to give WonderPho a try.. can a Pho joint be that bad??   Post Lunch hour at 3 pm.. the place was quite empty.   They have now the Happy Hour Special that you can get 50% off coffee, smoothies and starters.. and if you are into beer drinking $12 for 4 beers. Since I am not INTO beer drinking today, I opt for the 50% off smoothies specials.  Papaya Smoothies ($2) - Smallish... but for $2 is A-OK.. I don't think I would have pay full price for it - Papaya taste was really light.. and tasted more like a slush more than a smoothies.. but maybe good calorie wise?  Pho Bo with Rare Beef and Beef Brisket ($6.89) - The bean sprouts and the basil leaf were kind of withering... a sad sign to see...  - The broth did has this strong taste of anise... some might like it... - Rare Beef was well done...  - Size wise is quite good for a small... no complaint here - Not fresh noodle but cooked well..   Services is A+. Polite, attentive and fast.... but since there were 3 staffs and 3 occupied tables, I do expect good services!  Deco is nice and chic... not your usual cheap Pho Joint. Dare I say is a good place for a date? But with Free WIFI.. they might be busy playing with their toys or the Yelp Apps trying to check in! I am guilty of that!"}
{"text":"First snow of the winter season and WonderPho came to the rescue. I ordered the Pho Bo with Shaved Ribeye, Veal Brisket, and Beef Ball noodle soup. The meat was tender and the broth flavourful. Friendly staff and attentive service. It was overall a great experience and I particularly enjoyed the garnished deep fried onions. Must try Yelpers!"}
{"text":"This place has stepped up it's Pho ability since I came here when it first opened. The broth is pretty nice and lots of meat/noodle ratio. The service was weird, we ordered some fresh and deep fried rolls to start and they didn't all come out at once and were were given one peanut sauce between 3 guys.   The side plate was weak, lacking basil and a few other staple veggies. Overall they definitely improved on their meal and I would come back since it is close to my work."}
{"text":"I go here often. Great Pho at a cheap price, especially with the 2 for 1 deal. Atmosphere is nice and service is always good."}
{"text":"So first things first. As a person who goes out to eat at vietnamese restaurants fairly often, Wonderpho's pho is decent and it's more westernized than most authentic pho eateries (take this statement how you like it). That being said, the service at this establishment is god awful.   I WAS a regular customer and I loved their BOGO deal (buy one get one free). The last time I went, the waitress took our order which was 2 large size pho with 2 regular sized ones and we SPECIFICALLY said please separate our bills so that the larges would be together and the regulars be the same; keep in mind my friends and I do this all the time. This was agreed upon and we got our food afterwards.  After we finished eating, we proceeded to pay for our food and the man at the cash register (guessing it was the manager/owner) put our bills saying we bought 2 larges so the regulars became free. We tried explaining that we've split the bills as a large and a regular (2 ways) multiple times and there was no problem with it. He insisted that it was the \"policy\" to have the bills that way and he asked us to show him evidence that we've previously got the bills as we asked for. Keep in mind, I never keep my receipts from restaurants and the request was just absurd. Both sides got heated and he called security because we wouldn't pay the bill the way it was.   The security came and did nothing about the situation because he found that it was too idiotic.  Like why would you call security over something this irrelevant? The owner obviously tried to use the scare tactic to make us pay the bill his way. When he saw we still weren't budging, he threatened to call the police and did so. After he explained the situation to the representative on the phone, he passed the phone to me and we explained our side of the story. The woman on the phone was just stunned at how stubborn he was over $1 and how stupid it was to potentially have 4 policemen patrol into a restaurant for something like that.   So when security and 911 didn't solve anything, he FINALLY suggested to make our bills the way we wanted (and the right way) so that we would pay. We agreed and let me tell you readers, I am NEVER going to Wonderpho ever again.  The owner ended up with less money than he would've (we obviously didn't tip) and even lost the respect from the security, the police as well as us.  Before I was wondering why this restaurant didn't attract much customers at all, well, now I know.  Screw Wonderpho."}
