{"text":"We went to Harlem on July 6th for Summerlicious Lunch.   This place has character, its comfortable, with a very cozy feel.  Great atmosphere, Great food. The service was great. The server was very engaging and genuinely nice and attentive. We had the Catfish sandwich and the vegetarian curry with coconut rice and for desert the Plaintain in brown sugar caramel sauce. (very delectable a definite must have). I would recommend this venue. It is a delightful experience"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent food, great music and good service. It would be better if the venue was bigger but I guess the layout makes it trendy and unique."}
{"text":"Summerlicious! Mmm... I had two course meals plus a dessert, and oh boy, they hit me like a mofo on a speedway. Salad, chicken and waffles, cheesecake... a little sugar and fat, and there's no smoke for the lungs! Man this is the ultimate splurge food!"}
{"text":"My recent trip to Canada concluded with dinner at Harlem Restaurant in downtown Toronto. I tell you, this was the best food I tasted during my trip. I dinned at the 67 Richmond St. E location of the restaurant. As soon as I walked through the door I feel in love with this eatery.  The service was friendly, the decor was captivating and dare I say it, I feel this establishment serves the best Chicken and Waffles I have ever tasted. I have tasted a few from Gladys Knight Chicken and Waffles to Roscoe's and this was the best presentation of the dish. I can't wait to go back for another visit. For more pictures of my delicious meal    http://shugatheroamingreporter.blogspot.com/2014/01/toronto-feature-review-harlem-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"I think I may have fallen victim to poor ordering here... Humus avocado dip to start, both dips were under-seasoned and the crackery chip things were wet with the oil they were fried in. My beef ribs were tough, seeming as if they could have used a few more hours of slow cooking. My Dad's stewed chicken on the other hand was delicious with big bold flavour, falling off the bone and very saucy. So many other things on the menu, I am sure that next time I will find my menu match."}
{"text":"A few friends and I made a reservation here to check out their Summerlicious menu. The experience was horrible from beginning to end. When we walked in we were greeted by a man. We told him we had a reservation and he very rudely asked us what name it was under and gestured his hand as if to say \"hurry up\". Ok. He seats us at one of the worst tables at any restaurant, right by the front door. We asked if any other tables were available, he said no. We ask what about upstairs? He says no.. Fine. Our waitress comes, takes our order. As we are sitting at the table we can see other guests going upstairs to be seated... so we asked the waitress if it's at all possible to sit upstairs. She asks one of the waiters from upstairs if there is any room up there he says \"yes ofcourse!\" So as we make our way upstairs the waitress tells us shes going to have to cancel our order because it's a \"different system\" up there. We didn't care as long as we didn't have to sit by the door. So we get upstairs and the place is near empty. We find a table and within a few minutes our food comes, even though we were expecting to have to re-order.. The appetizers  were probably the best part of the entire meal. Each of us ordered a different one and they were all good. For my entree I ordered the blackened catfish, VERY underwhelming. One of my friends ordered  the Jambalaya, the rice was wet and soggy, had no flavour, to be honest it was actually pretty gross. So she gave it back and ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were room temperature and the chicken could use more flavour. Within seconds of finishing our entree we are brought our dessert (which was good but nothing special) and are told we have about 10 minutes to leave because they \"need our table\". We were in the restaurant for under an hour at this point and were getting VERY frustrated. We had made a reservation and wanted to see the live performance but we're told we had to leave to make space for other customers.. we literally had to negotiate with one of the servers to stay for a few more minutes.. very sad. this was by far the WORST experience I have ever had at any business let alone restaurant in my life. I would never go back to this stuck up place and will be telling everyone I know the same! If the tip wasn't included they would not have gotten an extra penny from me ! The worst!"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious and my girlfriend and I ordered the chicken and waffle mains. Even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, service was exceptionally slow. We got put at the absolute worst seats (we sat by the window where construction was going on right out front) and weren't given a menu or water until 15 minutes into our wait. The staff were pretty nice but messed up our orders and forgot to give us water although they gave everybody in the restaurant water before us. Food was mediocre and definitely not worth the $60 we paid. They deserved a 10% tip AT MOST but 15% gratuity was already included. Such a disappointment. We definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I went here today for brunch.  I sat on the patio which was a nice space - its kind of a cut-out between the buildings with awnings to provide shade and murals on the walls.  My friend and I were both saying how we'd like to come back in the evening to see what it looked like.  I had the Harlem sandwich which was ham, jerk chicken and cheese with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich was really good.  My friend had the Harmel eggs benny and she wasn't crazy about the pancake bottom instead of the usual english muffin.    The service was really slow - the guy was really nice - it just took forever for him to come out to the patio to look after us.  All in all, it was fun and I'd go back - but I'd go for dinner to see the vibe at night."}
{"text":"Great vibes here, Fun experience, great service and great food. Everything has a little nice spice to it which I loved!!"}
{"text":"We've been there for brunch a few times and I have to confess, I've ordered the eggs benedict with the greens a few times.   Next on my list is to check out their cool side patio for cocktails. :)  ** If you are at St. Lawrence market & want a Southern Brunch or lunch, check it out, it's just up the street**"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Highly recommended. Oh. And get the chicken and waffles..."}
{"text":"With a relaxed atmosphere, delicious foot and cool vibes.  You can't go wrong.  This is a spot for the ones that know where cool lives."}
{"text":"What a terrible place to go for a lunch meal. I went there for summerlicious for lunch and it took 55 minutes to even get my appetizer. When I asked the server where my food was, he looked through his little note pad and said \"you didn't get it yet?\" when we could see it was crossed off and 15 pages back from the current page he was writing on. The server constantly blamed the restaurant for being too busy and always brought out the wrong food for other guests. The food was alright though but I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant due to their terrible customer service. What's worst is that they tacked on 15% tip for 2 people on the final. I definitely am not recommending this restaurant to anyone and if anyone asks about it, I will definitely tell them to stay away."}
{"text":"You're probably here for a food review. Well, it IS a restaurant, but I haven't tried the food. I went on a 3rd Sunday for the spoken word event held in their event room above the main dining area... and it was AWESOME. The space was narrow, with a long and well-stocked wooden bar running along one side. I saw food served upstairs but most people seemed to order a basket of fries or other finger foods to share. The space was cozy and welcoming. The artists were passionate, lyrical, unexpectedly intense in their delivery and the room crackled with their nervous electricity. I will definitely go back... and maybe try the food this time :)"}
{"text":"CONS -was upstairs with 2 other large groups. We sat at plastic folding tables that were all too close together and felt like they could collapse at any moment  -there seemed to be only one bartender and one server, so the service was painfully slow. Had to ask to have our orders taken, water wasn't brought when asked, etc.  -asked that the air conditioning be turned down (it was 5 degrees outside so not sure why it was on) as we were frozen despite wearing our coats inside. It took 40 min for someone to shut it off despite the server acknowledging that there were multiple complaints -the bus boys with the food kept delivering plates to the wrong people (if our server made an appearance that shouldn't have happened) -food took forever and it was cold when it came (I had the fried chicken which should have been piping hot inside. Also it was so dim I couldn't check if my chicken was fully cooked)  PROS -the intimate setting  -great singer"}
{"text":"We came for the fried chicken and waffles. The portions for the main dishes were huge but the apps were pretty small - especially the cornbread serving.   The service we had could have been better - she was either having a bad day or was pretty new to the serving world. She could have been more attentive but we didn't mind since we were all there to socialize with each other.   The seafood \"fondue\" wasn't really a fondue.. more like a soup with bread - but still pretty good! The fried pickles were 'aight. All the dipping sauces came out of a bottle ie. \"thai sweet chili\" and \"spicy mayo\".   The texture of the fried chicken was excellent - but lacking in flavour. I wish it had more of a kick to it!   I'd probably stop in for lunch if I was in the neighborhood but won't venture out looking for it."}
{"text":"I've always been interested in coming here as I live in the area. I came in last night to meet a friend, who had already been there for 10 minutes. From the time I sat down it took our server another 10 minutes to come to the table. At this point she realized that my friend had ordered us water (about 20 minutes earlier- before I came) and left to get it for us. When she returned she put it down on the table and quickly went to a couple who had just walked in despite the fact that we said we were ready to order. She took their drink order and then walked past us, not taking our order. When she finally came to take our order 5 minutes later- I ordered two apps and I very clearly and nicely explained that I wanted them as my mains. My friend ordered an app and a main. The food all came at once. AND it was really not worth it. Bland and nothing tasted fresh. It took forever for her to clear our plates- after which she proceeded to sit and eat her dinner --so we had to bug her to get our bill while she was eating- which is always uncomfortable.  I would never eat here again.  Bland, reheated food  and hilariously bad service.  The ambience was kinda cool- I liked some of the lighting fixtures and furnishings, but that's about all it has got going for it."}
{"text":"I went here again recently, and while the food was still good (yum Southern Fried Chicken), there was no AC and it was sweltering hot outside.  We sat on the patio and AC condensation from the next door building dripped on us.  Service was also spotty and a tad slow with little attention to detail.  For those reasons, I am downgrading my rating to a 3-star."}
{"text":"I don't know where the other yelpers have been dining, but it's not here.   Nice main room, good (small) outdoor patio. Excellent music venue upstairs. More about that later.   In answer to some of the more meanspirited reviews posted here: seated immediately. Service attentive yet not intrusive. Service also very caring; when I confessed I was here the night before my daughter's wedding, the server bought me a drink. That's never happened to me before, and I suspect it never will again.   I hope this addresses the reviewers who found the service wanting.  (Note to the fellow who rated 1 star after leaving before eating: read Dante; he knew where you'd end up).   Food? Food was amazing. Mussels generous and superb, mushroom stew extraordinary, catfish the freshest and best I've ever had. We went upstairs and listened to live reggae. Same service, same smiling faces.   Look, I'm just in town for the night, but I clearly recognize when a few disgruntled miscreants take it upon themselves to solve a petty complaint with the hammer they happen to wield.   If this is you, if you're reading this: shame on you. May you one day find yourself running a creditable business and battling with faceless cowards.   My face is attached to this review because I don't hide."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about Harlem from friends, I had to try it. My boyfriend and I went for dinner and were not disappointed!   We ordered the Salmon with Coconut rice n peas, and the Guiness Marinated Chicken with Mac & cheese. Both meals were delicious! Real southern comfort food. Everything was cooked to perfection. The flavours were incredible. We really enjoyed the collard greens that were served with the meal as well.   The server was excellent! Attentive, super friendly, and treated us like family.   We will definitely be coming back and will recommend to others looking for Cajun creole amazingness!"}
{"text":"Margaret our server was top notch!  Very friendly and funny!   Chicken and waffles were delicious.  Crispy and moist.  Jerk chicken was a disappointment tasted like BBQ chicken.  Mac and cheese & meat loaf were also delicious!  The greens that we're served alongside some plates were bland.  Washroom wasn't that clean at the end of the night."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is good, the mac and cheese is just okay, and rice and peas is disappointing. Many of the dishes we saw coming out looked good. Unfortunately, our first experience at Harlem was ruined by a hot headed female server who decided it was okay to belittle and bully us (loudly) when we questioned the 15% gratuity that was automatically added to our bill. We have no problem tipping well for great service and food, however we felt 15% was not deserved. It's presumptuous and rather insulting of the restaurant to add this automatically. I understand this is often done at restaurants for large groups but we were a group of 2. The two other staff members we encountered were friendly and apologetic when our order was a little mixed up. We will never return to Harlem due to the attitude of this particular server; we will go elsewhere for fried chicken and great service."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place!! Best food we've had in a while!   Food: I had the jerk chicken with the rice and greens. One of the most moist chickens I've ever had. My wife had the chicken quesadilla which she thoroughly enjoyed.   Bartender/service: The bartender was a cool dude. We got the Sunday special and it was great (felt like he topped it up with a few extra shots - rum punch)   Vibe:  Vibe was nice - good music.   Overall, would recommend this place to anyone. Definitely a gem! Can't wait for my next meal here."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience.  Ordered the Mac and cheese with Fried chicken.  Mac and cheese tasted like KD and the chicken lacked seasoning and while the outside was perfectly crisp, the inside was undercooked.  Also tried a salad with avocado and feta cheese. It was super delicious and fresh.  Overall, 3/5 for the ambience and OK food.  Food would be awesome if it was more seasoned."}
{"text":"After a long afternoon on the beach I was pretty hungry and southern food served on a patio seemed like just the thing. I ordered the fried chicken.  I got a big plate with three pieces of fried chicken (it seemed to be a breast and two thighs), a dish of mac and cheese, and a helping of collard greens. The chicken was pretty good -- moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside, although in places the coating was inexplicably sweet, not really what I was expecting. The mac and cheese was creamy and mild and the collard greens were crunchy and, well, green-tasting. The patio was dark pleasant despite the giant bright tv taking up one wall.   I was only able to finish about half of my food, and the server boxed up the rest for me. I spent the next morning day-dreaming about my left over chicken, mac and cheese, and collard greens. But, when I cracked open the styrofoam container, the greens where nowhere to be found! What's the deal Harlem? I want my collard greens back ..."}
{"text":"It's a great place that serves authentic soul food. I recommend the chicken and waffles. The rum punch is amazing as well. Great atmosphere and service, it's small but inviting. I met the owner last time I was there for a private function he was very courteous  and generous. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Seems many of the 1 star summerlicious related reviews about Harlem Restaurant are accurate.   Went to the restaurant expecting great food and decent service. Left the restaurant hungry and received terrible service.   Made a reservation, arrived on time with my girlfriend,  and still waited to be seated. We wanted to be seated in the dining room but it became obvious that seating a couple in the dining area was not a priority as many of the tables could seat 4. We were asked if we wouldn't mind the patio which looked dark and derelict or going upstairs for live music. These two were not an option for us so we declined.  After being seated, our table was rocking like a small boat on stormy seas. A small fix which took about 10 minutes. After waiting another 10 minutes (total 20 minutes) we decided that since we haven't received any other service since the table fix, would spend our money elsewhere.   The most shocking part of this experience was when informing a staff member that we were not happy with the lack of service after our 20 minute wait and that we would be leaving, his expression was that of someone who really did not care and it seems that this was not the first time this had occurred this evening.   I will never be eating at this restaurant again and I would never recommend it to anyone especially during summerlicious."}
{"text":"When I heard they had chicken and waffles on the menu I knew I had to try it out. I think it's only available on their brunch menu, so come early if that's what you're looking for. The other brunch menu items were pretty standard and kind of forgettable, so we didn't try anything else other than the chicken 'n waffles.  It comes with 2 drumsticks, one thigh, a whole Belgian style waffle, and spinach?!? Definitely could've done without the spinach cuz it just didn't work, but it did give some colour to the dish I guess.  The star of the dish was the chicken of course, but they were all overcooked. How can you overcook fried chicken you ask? Well the top layer of chicken meat was really dried out and the batter was burnt (dark brown). But the center of the chicken was still juicy enough and the batter was tasty. It was sinful eating the skin, but it was so crispy that it didn't seem like I was eating skin!  It was good, but I think the next time I get a craving for chicken 'n waffles, I'll go to the Stockyards, which is still king of Toronto's FC joints in my opinion."}
{"text":"We were here for Winterlicious 2015, and had the dinner prix fixe. The place evokes the Prohibition, bootlegging era, so it had a packed, tables-too-close-together, shabby vintage chic kind of feel, and it can be a bit of a squeeze inside. We were upstairs where there was live jazz entertainment and the main bar, and because it got busy (it was a Saturday night), the servers were always having to squeeze through and weave through the crowd.   I had nowhere to hang my coat, so I had to drape it over my stool and sit on it - some of the bar stools have backs, and some have none. I eventually found the coat hooks, situated under the bar itself, but it didn't seem like a very good idea to have my coat hanging there for random strangers to brush past, and as I've already mentioned, the upstairs is a bit of a squeeze.  I started with the kale, walnut and pear salad, which was fine; the dressing was a little sweet to my taste, but I personally prefer tart dressing so that's on me. The little pear spears went nicely with the greens, and the occasional crunch of nutty walnut was a nice note. Serving-wise, it was adequate, and I had no complaints. For the mains, I had the catfish jambalaya which was pretty good - props to the serving sizes, there was quite a lot of jambalaya! It had seared catfish on top, and it tasted pretty good - nice bits of shrimp, Italian sausage and chicken to complement.  It's a spicy dish and I found the rice a little too mushy, but it was my first time to have jambalaya so I do not know if the rice in it is supposed to be very mushy or have the consistency of steamed rice (jambalaya research/taste test, here I come!). It tasted good to me anyway, and I'd recommend it but be sure to have lots of water on hand, because they're not kidding when they say the Italian sausage is spicy. It is!  In my opinion the jambalaya was the star of the night, because it went downhill from there. I tried the candied plantains, and was not impressed. It was dry and either it hadn't been boiled/cooked long enough or it hadn't ripened enough, because it was tough to chew and too starchy.   While the wait service was speedy and they got our meals to us in good time, it was when we tried to pay that they slipped, because it took a good ten minutes before the waiter noticed we were done and trying to catch his attention. Another ten minutes went by before they brought the debit machine over. Granted it was a busy night, but you'd think they'd ensure table turnover was swift and painless so they could have more customers.   I would probably go back to Harlem East, but on a week night next time, to avoid the crush and hopefully get to pay faster at the end!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday lunch with a group of people. Food was decent Chicken and waffles is a must. But the restaurant charged our bill with a \"cake fee\" for bringing in cupcakes. It was ridiculous. It wasn't even busy and it was just cupcakes. It was a ridiculous $ 20! Don't bother coming here for a birthday and you intend on bringing cakes or treats for you party."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and live music some nights.  Nice comfortable atmosphere.  Get the family-style menu to be able to try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"Took my friends to Harlem yesterday and we were all extremely disappointed. I felt terrible because I'd recommended it highly, having loved loved loved  Harlem Underground and assumed that the food would be the same. I don't know - maybe they were having an off day but here was my meal: (a) the corn bread tasted half baked. It was thick and heavy instead of light and fluffy (b)  the mac and cheese was blah - sortof watery (c)  the fried chicken was heavily fried and nothing to write home about  On the plus side my friends said the drinks were strong and the people who had the guiness marinated chicken realy liked it.  We did not stay for dessert because we were quie disappointed.  Despite it being closer to my home than Harlem Underground we shal stick to that location."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious lunch menu. And had THE worst experience in all my years of summer/winterlicious. For starters my friend ordered the KALE salad.. Which was not kale when it came out.. And actually consisted of rotten and unwashed lettuce. She couldn't even eat it.  I ordered corn bread. It came out in 3 paper thin slices that were hard as a rock they broke apart like melba toast, one of which I couldn't even break with a fork. I had to soak it in butter... I think they save the previous days unsold portions and just serve at lunch.  My friend had the jerk chicken sandwhich, there was practically no meat on the bun... Like literally just a couple small strips.  I ordered chicken and waffles. Chicken was ok, but their  'special sauce' that the waiter mentioned is just sweet chili sauce anyone can purchase.  Desert was brownies which were stale and hard like the cornbread.  Terrible, terrible experience! I never send back food because we all know what happens. We couldn't wait to just pay the bill and leave..  ended up at another restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere.  Great art on the walls, super cool artsy furniture, comfortable booths, nice lighting, except for reading the menu, couldn't see a darn thing.  I have been a few times to this place, the food is really good, everyone I bring here is always really satisfied with their meal.  The only time I was slightly less than satisfied was when I ordered the beef ribs.  don't get me wrong, they tasted great, but they are advertised to have a spicy scotch bonnet kick.  It was all sweet though, not at all spicy.  Gimmie some kick,  man! The chicken dishes are good, the veg dishes are good, the fish, especially the catfish are good.  I don't eat pork but others eating those dishes seemed very happy and they do make a veg option of the jambalaya dish, which my daughter loved.  Spent a couple of nights upstairs for the live entertainment.  Nice place.  Actually, I've done it all, comedy, a band and a dj.  It was all good.  Well decorated, clean, good atmosphere, not too loud.  always a good time."}
{"text":"Went here with 3 friends for Summerlicious earlier this year. Portion size was good but the food itself was nothing really special. For my meal I chose the deep fried Cajun spiced okra, Jerk chicken sandwich (made with coco bread) and sweet plantain for dessert. The okra was crispy and seasoned well. The Jerk chicken sandwich was underwhelming though. The components of the dish were too simple and there was nothing to elevate the plate or the sandwich itself to make it special. Yet, the candied plantains were an adequate sweet treat that tied the theme of the meal together.   My friends had the chicken and waffles with scotch bonnet sauce on the side which honestly I might have preferred more over my sandwich.  The biggest downsides to my experience were that I was given a glass that had very visible lipstick stains on the rim, not to mention that my friend found a piece of the dish washing scrubber in her food. She alerted the staff and they gave her a discount, but overall our experience was tainted by sanitation faux pas that were likely a result of the staff being overwhelmed by the Summerlicious crowds."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, made a reservation and no one was available to seat us. Took 20 minutes to be approached for a drink order. Was there for 90 minutes and not once did the server check in to refill beverages or see how we were doing. Was served white wine in a cognac glass and the bottle was open before arriving at the table. Never returning."}
{"text":"The fried and jerked chicken was amazing but the ribs were by far the best I've ever had.  I'll be returning within the week for a second round. Thanks Harlem!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been a few times, with it being so close to where I live. The atmosphere is always bustling, there's usually live music upstairs and it's a bit quieter downstairs. Sometimes we've waited up to maybe 40 minutes for our food, sometimes it comes pretty quickly. The service has always been friendly, and I like that we've never felt pushed out the door, even when the place is packed. But onto the food. It's real comfort food, I ordered the beef short ribs my first time there, and I always go back for more (I dislike chili, the dish is not spicy). I haven't gotten around to trying the fried chicken yet but my friends have ordered it and enjoyed it a lot. I love the side of Mac and Cheese available with most dishes."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with some friends! The fried chicken and waffle was VERY good! But the best part was the service! We had the winterlicious lunch deal which included a 15% gratuity and tax. Our friend mistakenly added an additional tip while paying the bill. When our waiter was informed, he actually returned the amount! I thought that was extra nice of him and totally made my lunch experience that extra bit special!"}
{"text":"Harlem is a great very casual lace to grab a bite without having to resort to a diner.  In my opinion, Harlem has the best catfish in the city.  The bread pudding is also a standout menu item."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and waffles here. The music and atmosphere are fantastic and the food comes promptly.  Fantastic experience all around. Whenever I have an excuse to come here I don't hesitate. Slightly pricey but since I don't know anywhere else to get a meal like this they've got me haha."}
{"text":"My experience at Harlem was absolutely dreadful.  Went for summerlicious. The desserts were actually a joke... A single cookie?? Or a tart made with a store-bought pastry shell that wasn't even cooked?? Blackened catfish that wasn't even black? Overall worst value dinner of my life thus far.   If the food wasn't bad enough, the service was unreal. Neglect. Staff must have been in another world. Running up and down the stairs. Out of breath. Completely unprepared. We waited what seemed like an eternity for drinks (which eventually came much later after pulling a different server aside). Got our food before we got cutlery (which took awhile as forks came from the main floor while knives came from the second?).   And mandatory gratuity? It was actually insulting. No wonder the service was so deplorable, the front of house staff doesn't have to try at their job and it sure shows."}
{"text":"This is my first review and after years lurking a trip to Harlem has pushed me into start writing reviews.  5 stars would be awarded just for the ambiance but unfortunately I could only give 2. With encouragement from my SO I've bumped it to a 3 which he feels is deserved because they kept the reservation he made. I went there to catch a game since the place is near by and most of the reviews are good. When I got there I noticed they had a summerlisious menu so me and my SO went for it.  We both had the corn bread; it was tasty but ridiculously small. Since all the reviews mentioned good portions I though this was a joke. Then came the chicken and waffles. The chicken was great and the waffles were delicious, unfortunately the salad was drowning in sweet chili sauce from the chicken. dessert was a small mango tart and a chocolate almond cookie. These were both good but small and not worth going for the summerlisious menu.  Service was good but disorganized and I notice the couple next to us was very disappointed this affected my experience.  I can't help but feel the restaurant has taken advantage of the idea of summerlisious and offered items that would cost less when ordered separately off the regular menu. I would not go back for more than a few drinks if only for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It a cute little joint with lots of character. The artwork on entrance wall is really quite beautiful if you bother to take it in. The service was great, ask for Pedro he's awesome! Now for the big deal, the food! If you're not on a diet and love savory you have to try the fried chicken and waffles! Ah, even if you are on a diet you should still try it! It's the only way to go!  Whether your on a date or out with some friends Harlem is a great little place to fill your appetite."}
{"text":"When it's good it's amazing, but unfortunately the food is not consistent.  Their weekend brunch can be quite tasty and their candied yams are incredible.  I unfortunately don't go as often because when they are having an off night the food just isn't good.  I am guessing they have 2 different chefs."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and enjoyed the food.  It was a bit of a shame that Cora's has a line-up out the door while we were the only ones in this place.  Though the food does seem a bit over priced (similar to Cora's in that regard).    Our server was very polite, though the cooks took a little longer than expected.  Other than that, the experience was good (we had the Harlem Benny and the Harlem Mash-up).  The Mash-up was a bit more conventional than I was expecting, but sweet potato patty and cornbread were both good (there was some shell in my eggs and they were a little over done).  The Benny was really good, and is strongly recommended.   Definitely worth a brunch visit."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were EXCELLENT! Chicken was super crunchy outside, incredibly tender inside. Paired with the sweet flavour of maple syrup and waffles makes it a cant-miss taste combo."}
{"text":"By the look and smell of the place, Harlem would've been a great place for my birthday dinner - if they hadn't ERASED (given away) my reservations that I made a week prior.   Not only did I make the reservation with ample time for the restaurant to plan, but I also confirmed my reservations 2 days prior. Unfortunately, when I arrived, they told me I did not even have a reservation. After talking to several people, I came across someone (who appeared to be the manager) who remembered talking to me on the phone. One of the staff at Harlem admitted they made a mistake with my reservatons, and told me they were working on it. About 15 minutes later, I was told that there was nothing they could do except perhaps give me reservations on an alternate day. (Yes, because my party of 10, all with busy schedules and meeting to celebrate my birthday, could come back next week just like that).   I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of customer service. I understand that a mistake was made, but I do not understand why they could not at least offer a token of their apologies such as a dinner voucher. Harlem left my friends and I stranded on a Saturday evening for what should've been a strees-free celebration.   Perhaps my case was a one-off mistake, but I would recommend for any future Yelp-ers with group reservations to double/triple confirm your reservations especially on the day of your event."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The first time was during summerlicious and had a great time with a few friends. The staff was great and super friendly. We were seated upstairs, and it might have been better to have been downstairs outside but the great conversations with the staff made up for everything. The food was good, I had the Catfish Lafayette and the Chicken and Waffles. The Catfish Lafayette was especially good and I had it again the second time I went, followed by the pasta infused with jerk. I thought the food was good again but the main really didn't seem to have the jerk taste I was looking for. Overall the people are amazing and create a great atmosphere. Had a great time and would go back here any time."}
{"text":"Great little place. The decor is cool and the music was amazing. Was shazaming all night. The jerk chicken quesadilla (9.95) was sweet and tangy. The southern fried chicken (17.95) was tasty and the mac- n-cheese I ordered with it was fantastic. Portion sizes are very filling. We had to wait a bit for our food but this place has a welcoming vibe."}
{"text":"Harlem is close by and my girl and I enjoy the ambiance! Harlem has some very unique art work and a alleyway style patio. We always enjoy the warm plantain and a glass of wine or beer. They have live music upstairs as well."}
{"text":"Okay - not worth coming back. We sampled the Winterlicious menu so it was nice trying an assortment of dishes. The curried veggie stew was comforting on a cold day like today, but no better than something I could make myself at home. Dessert was not how it was described on the menu. My boyfriend enjoyed the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Solid service, nice location, but I found both the chicken and waffles and the mac and cheese to be a little bland. The jambalaya and candied plantain were excellent though."}
{"text":"I recently reserved the second floor for a family brunch party.  The restaurant called and emailed me several times to confirm the reservation, number of people, and what we expected vis a vis food and such.  I even visited once and talked about the set up with staff.  We had 25 guests.  And they had one server! And one cook.  Not just for us, but for the whole restaurant!  This meant that members of my family and I had to serve and bus the tables.  We had fun with it, but it was really crazy.  I emailed the owner and still haven't had a response.  Very strange."}
{"text":"Now in two delicious locations!  Since it's the eve of the grand opening of their second location, I thought it fit to pay tribute to my third stop on my epic birthday journey - Harlem's first location on Richmond St E.  On taking care of the customer:  I don't usually make plans to celebrate my birthday; it's just not my style.  But on pressing from a friend I caved and agreed that there would be a small dinner get-together for a few close friends.  Accounting for significant others, I made a reservation for ten.  Harlem's upstairs dining area happens to have a room that fits ten comfortably and makes for an intimate dining experience.  When we arrived, the room was set up for us.  Unfortunately, we now numbered 14.  When I raised this (apologetically) to our server, he said \"that's fine,\" and proceeded to clear out half of the rest of the dining room and fill it with extra tables they keep in the back.  Notwithstanding the presence of another dinner party, our server somehow found a way to accommodate all of us without advance notice of the change.  I was impressed and grateful.  My only concern with the upstairs is that the entire floor was uncomfortably warm.  On feeding 14:  I have some fussy friends.  Some are vegetarian, some don't like unusual food, and some just have strange tastes.  I myself am a bit of a tough critic, at least in this price range.  With only one hiccup, our entire group left absolutely delighted with their dinners.  The menu offers tremendous variety and everything we had was delicious.  I had a Chicken Lafayette appetizer, a Blackened Catfish main that came topped with a fantastic seafood etouffee and a side order of Mac and Cheese.  The chicken was a fairly straightforward but very tasty dish, essentially chunks of chicken tossed in what I took to be a Louisiana sauce.  I had been craving catfish for a very long time, so the main was a hit - little bits of seafood soaked in a buttery sauce, sprawled over catfish.  The Mac and Cheese was good, but not mind-blowing as others have claimed.  Not sure I'd bother next time, although half of it made an excellent midnight snack that night.  The cocktails we had were also delicious even the \"most girly thing you can think to make\" that my friend A.D. was kind enough to sport me as a celebratory libation.  But I really enjoy a beer with dinner, especially if it's Cajun food.  I wasn't impressed with the offerings, bottles all of them.  --------------------------------------------- Afterword: It wouldn't be fair to omit the one issue we had with the food.  Before ordering the Chicken Lafayette, I ordered mussels, but they were served undercooked (as in barely open).  There's no excuse for this - they were visibly unfit for serving.  Still, if I could put this remark in fine print, I would."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time on a Saturday night, with reservations. Res was for 7pm - the 3 piece jazz/r&b band started playing at 7:30 (and they were great, by the way). I believe the musicians change from week to week. I had requested to be seated in the upper floor, where the band plays, so I did not get much of a look at the bottom floor. The atmosphere is nice, with exposed brick walls, colourful paintings and chandeliers. I will say that the space is very small, we were fortunate that for the first half of our dinner the tables on either side of us were empty - I can see this place feeling a bit cramped when it is at full capacity.  The menu here is not huge, but offers plenty of tasty-sounding options that you can't get at every other restaurant in the city. I had the corn bread to start (deeelish) and a my main, the jerk smoked chicken with mac n' cheese and collard greens on the side. The jerk smoked chicken had an amaaaazing flavour, very saucy (probably too much for some people, but I enjoy sauciness!). The Mac N Cheese was ohhhhh so creamy, and a very generous helping - the waitress, bless her, suggested I add some crumbled bacon to it, and how could I say no to bacon??  The collard greens were really tasty! First time i have tried them - definitely not for the veggie hater; if you like spinach or swiss chard I think you will be ok with these. For dessert, split the feature that day which was a mango cheesecake, very light and full of flavour.. If you're having a drink - give the squeeze tease a try - rum and gingerale with a little lemon - goes down very nicely :)  The server was very friendly, helpful when asked for menu recommendations. I did not find the service slow as others have mentioned but again - the place really didn't start filling up until I was nearing leaving (9:30ish).  Overall, great place, nice change from the usual, I will definitely be back in the future to enjoy some good tunes and try out some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Harlem Cuisine: Southern/Soul Location: Downtown Address: 67 Richmond St E Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 3  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information: *Open for lunch *2 locations in Toronto Downtown *Live Jazz Music upstairs during Dinner  One of the first few restaurants that I found on Yelp which I've been wanting to try forever is Harlem. If you didn't know, I am in love/obsessed with Southern food. I love Southern fried chicken, ribs, mac&cheese, collard greens, potato salad....just thinking about it makes me drool!!  I've been to the famous Sylvia's in Harlem, NY where I had THE best fried chicken and potato salad (which you can check out here at FoodigatorJ EATS on my blog). Plus many small hole-in-the-wall locations in Bronx where they would sell 3 pieces of fried chicken in a paper bag. It always made me sad how they didn't have any restaurants in Vancouver serving Southern/Soul food. So when I found Harlem that was so close to my house, I was SO excited to try it out!  I visited Harlem for dinner on a Tuesday night around 6o'clock. My friend and I were the first ones there and a friendly waitress greeted us and told us we could sit whereever we want. Inside of the restaurant is dark with deep red walls and has a very laid back feel to it. I believe it does get busier later during the night.  CORN BREAD 3/5 *This was complimentary (for dinner) *Small loaf cut into thin slices *Served hot with butter *This is pre-made and then microwaved before it's served to you *Cornbread was light and airy *These were decent but it wasn't done how it's suppose to be *Usually they should served in squares and have rougher texture (grainy with cornmeal) *They were ok considering it was complimentary, but I wouldn't order them  Ordered: SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN 4.5/5 *3 pieces of fried chicken served with collard greens and mac&cheese for $16.95 *Chicken pieces are huge covered with crispy batter and sweet chili sauce on top *Portions are huge here, served with 2 sides this could enough for 2 girls *This was different from regular buttermilk battered chicken because the seasoning comes from the chili sauce, not the batter *Chicken was crispy and the chili sauce complimented the dish without over-powering *The batter was just right and the meat was juicy, tender and cooked just right *If you never had collard greens, it will take some time to get used to *It was cooked just right and worked as a nice palate cleanser between pieces of fried chicken *Mac & Cheese comes piping hot in the huge bowl *Huge size for a side (could be a meal on it's own) *Very cheesy and buttery but not overly rich *I couldn't even finish the sidedishes and I almost cried leaving some behind cause it was so good  Ordered:JERK SMOKED BBQ CHICKEN  3.5/5 *3 pieces of Chicken served with collard greens and coconut bean rice for $17.95 *Chicken pieces are huge, again, very big portion *She got the beans and rice instead of Mac & Cheese *It had very strong BBQ sauce flavor, couldn't really taste the Jerk flavor *Beans and rice was kind of on the dry side and it was just mediocre *Chicken was juicy with lots of meat *I wish it could have had more of that jerk chicken flavor because it tasted just like BBQ chicken to me  I went back for lunch one more time after the first visit, so I will include that in here as well  Ordered: ROASTED JERK CHICKEN SANDWICH 5/5 *Roasted jerk chicken with sweet fried plantain, Monterrey Jack, scotch bonet mayo served on toasted coco bread for $10.00 *I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this *Their lunch portions are huge *Because I ordered Mac&Cheese as a side, I went with a salad *Salad was simple and light with vinegrette dressing which went perfectly with somewhat heavy sandwich *Jerk chicken pieces with fried plantain, cheese, mayo was a strange yet excellent combination *This was my first time trying coco bread, it's basically like hamburger bun but with potato bread texture (crispy on the outside) *plaintain pieces added soft texture and sweetness to the sandwich, while jerk chicken gave it that kick *mayo and cheese just combined everything together and made this an excellent sandwich  Note: 2nd time I went back, I ordered their Mac&Cheese again and it wasn't very good. The cheese sauce was really runny and the macaroni was over-cooked. So keep in mind that this restaurant CAN be inconsistent.  Summary: Overall, I really enjoyed dining at Harlem. It brought me memories back from when I was lucky enough to visit real Southern restaurants down in the States. Personally I feel like their dishes are little tamed down (flavor wise) compared to real soul food, but overall the food is tasty and the service is excellent. I would like to visit during their busy night with live music!"}
{"text":"A bit of a late review but we went during Winterlicious. We got the chicken and waffles, jambalaya, cornbread, fried fish, brownies and red velvet cake. Basically, we ordered for 2 with the prix fixe menus and made sure we tried as many different things as possible. Overall it was a good experience.   I liked how unique the place was. The food was also very good. I'm a fan of the chicken and waffles, the fried fish and the cornbread. The jambalaya fell a bit short, it just didn't have that wow factor with the flavour. The brownie and red velvet were also just your typical desserts, so nothing special there. I'm not a fan of plantain, in case anyone's wondering why we didn't try that (never liked it ever since I was a child). But the cornbread... my gosh, I could eat that all day!  Also, the service was okay. We were one of the first ones but the service was a bit slow. I was really hungry by the time the food came. I just felt like we didn't get as much attention as the other customers. The food was good though, so we just focused on that.  Quick tip: make a reservation. It's a small place that gets busy quickly."}
{"text":"Went years ago when I still ate meat and loved the chicken and waffles.  Since going veggie, I was impressed when I went back with a friend for summerlicious and had the veggie stew.  I liked it. I do think this restaurant is slightly lost on non-meat eaters since it's known for it's fried chicken, but I could still enjoy myself with my non-veggie friends."}
{"text":"Dirty south mind blown Dirty south bread Cat fish fired up, dirty south fed.  Yes, this is quote from a Ludacris song and no, the remainder of the lyrics aren't appropriate for a Yelp review.   Recently, I've been obsessed with fried chicken, so a friend and I decided to check out Harlem after shopping at the nearby Eaton Center.  It's like a taste of the south, but a bit pricier than places you've seen on the Food Network's \"Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  We started with the Jerk chicken quesadillas accompanied with a some greens and slaw.  Very sweet and a good portion.  I ordered the fried chicken as my main and it was tasty.  Three pieces battered chicken, crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  I sorta wished for two chicken breasts since the legs served up seemed small.  I found the batter sweet and tasty, but I prefer batter with a kick.  The macaroni and cheese was not quite cheesy enough. The cheese sauce was a bit thin.    The collared greens were collared greens.  My friend had the braised short ribs, they  were tender fall apart soft with a sweet tangy sauce.  The basmati rice she got as a side was less than exciting.  I really liked the drink selection!  I can't remember what I ordered... all I remember was it was strong and easy going down.  I liked that they had live music. Great atmosphere. Slow service...but have a drink or two, you won't even notice. Good food.  I'll be back to try the catfish. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious with a group of friends and we had a decent enough time. The fried catfish and the okra make for great appetizers (the okra is deep fried and so not slimy at all). The mains were just ok, I had the jambalaya which was a small portion for a pasta dish and tried some a friend's chicken and waffles. The jambalaya was ok and I won't comment on the chicken and waffles as it's not a dish I normally order or like so I'm no expert.  The vibe inside was pretty cool though, felt like being in a laid back bar in the south. The service was good, attentive and friendly. Overall I might go back for the experience but not necessarily the food."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to get 4-5 stars, i really did.   I'm a big big lover of cajun food I was really hoping for a warm hearty meal on a cool fall evening.   The place definitely looked like it was warm and friendly and the service was decent.   I ordered the jambalaya and sadly it was not very good.   The food was bland and lacked the texture of a classic jambalaya, for some reason it was dry rice with other stuff in it.    I even ordered some appetizers but they never came so that was also disappointing.    That said, will I come back... Probably not."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend wanting to try something different for date night and while there was nothing bad nothing stood out either. We had the sumerlicious dinner and started with cornbread and the catfish lafiyette. Both were really good tho I thought the cornbread portion was on the smaller side. For mains I had the chicken and waffles and he had the jumbalya. The chicken and waffles came in a huge portion.. enough for two people to share, I liked the chicken but the waffles were too plain for me. The sauces were good but the same as what you could buy in the grocery store. My boyfriend seemed to like his meal, said the fish was great but the portion seemed small compared to my meal. For dessert I had the brownie and he got the plantains, I liked his a lot more then mine.   Overall it wasn't a bad experience, we both agreed to try out the place after sumerlicious and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious soul food. Had southern fried chicken and waffles, while my wife had bbq chicken with mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles heaven! Extremely crispy and flavorful chicken, with the best sauces to accompany it. Only complaint would be that the waffles are a little too soft for my liking; but it is definitely a great spot if you're craving some comfort food!"}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant has its pros and cons.  we were here for winterlicious lunch.   The appetizers were really small and sad.  A few fried sliced pickles or a small mini loaf of cornbread.  Pickles were good but I really don't consider either an app....more like a sample.    Mains were definitely the highlight of the meal.   Catfish fish and chips were moist and batter was light the fish itself had no fishy flavor and was very very fresh honestly one of the best fish and chips I've had.  No complaints with the fried chicken and waffles the portion is large.  After I ate though I did have a slight greasy flavor in my mouth.  Dessert was really disappointing.   Unrippened hard plantains weren't really appetizing.  The other choice was some sort of brownie as described by staff but it came looking like a granola bar not sure where the chocolate went.   Also questionable of it was store bought.   All in all the entrees we're very good but the plating and quality of apps and dessert need a ton of work."}
{"text":"Just got back from my first trip to Harlem, and I'm incredibly impressed. I'd heard whispers and read reviews about the authentic southern cuisine and funky atmosphere, and I can say everything I heard was right on the money!  I had the Southern Fried Chicken with a side of mac'n cheese. The mac'n cheese was ok. I would have given it a bit more spice, as it kind of tasted like macaroni and cheese whiz at times... But that was the one low point. The chicken was spectacular! The best I'd had to date was at Veritas, but this is a close rival. I can't decide which one tops the list, as their both quite different, but this one is worth the trip on its own! The crisp batter is so full of flavour, I found myself trying to pick little pieces off the bone just to try and find what the secret ingredients might be.  Amy, my wife, made a special request and ordered off the lunch menu. I think because she's pregnant, they gave in! It was a catfish, shrimp and avacado sandwhich. And what a sandwhich!!   We finished it of with the Red Velvet Cake, which was a perfect end to a Southern Soul Food extravaganza!  Ok... one more little complaint...  I ordered a pre-dinner martini, straight up, a little dirty with olives. It came with a full slice of lemon on the edge of the glass. Whaaa?? I think it was a rookie mistake, from a terrific waiter who was on his own in a full house, so I'm not going to hold it against them. We actually thought it was quite funny!  All in all, I highly recommend Harlem. Lunch or dinner, the food is to die for!"}
{"text":"I love this place for many reasons. The atmosphere is hip and casual and the service is above average. The menu selection is diverse (fried chicken with waffles, mac 'n cheese, jambalaya, hummus with pita chips, etc ... you get the idea). The menu is a slick mix of Cajun & creole comfort food.   The food arrived piping hot and fresh enough to be right off the farm. Everything, every fork full burst with flavor. If I am ever back in Toronto I will be back to this place.  The live music and local art on the walls also adds to the very hip feel of this place. It is hard to hear people at times (because the live music can get loud) but I'm perfectly fine with that."}
{"text":"I guess I love my life...maybe I hate it... I'm not sure yet (@Jen K, Canchi M, Wayne C)  Ahem, alright so admittedly last night I ventured into the city for some Southern style fare... I'm not sure how best to write this review so I'm going to let this restaurants song namesake performed by Bill Withers tell the tale (with my own spin) - it makes NO sense at all but i thought it was fun....  HARLEM - BY BILL WITHERS (PERFORMED BY KRIS U)  Fall evening in Harlem, man it's a really cookin Well it's too early to sleep, and I'm too hungry...i need to EAT I don't what I'll eat as long as its Southern Fried Chicken  The other night in Harlem Lights were red and dim Well the staff was friendly, and super awesome Recco'd the Miles Davis Cocktail - So strong it was a Sin  Wesnesday night in Harlem, everything's \"alright\" Live Jazz upstairs means you can really swing and shake you're pretty Everything's \"alright\"  Thursday morning not in Harlem, the Mac and Cheese resides While my hip bones aint showing..my belly is sticking out Mac and Cheese and collard greens were the sides Probably could used a little more salt Overall a good experience but not a 4 star Hey, hey lawd, honey give your money to that southern fried chicken man.  Translation: Fried Chicken was pretty good...nice crisp, not as greasy as some said. However just adding Thai sweet chili sauce was kind unoriginal. The mac and cheese was bland but the collard greens were ok  Miles Davis Cocktail - OVERPROOF RUM and mixed juices. Strong and ....strong  Good ambiance though. Overall - I'd go back and try some other menu items.  25/30"}
{"text":"My friends threw me a birthday party here. This review might be a little biased as a result. I had an amazing time. I walked in and they were playing and old school dancehall set, ON A TUESDAY? Awesome. I had the jambalaya and the corn bread and they were super yummy. One of my friends had the fried chicken and waffles, I wish I had tried that. It looked even better. Very sexy ambiance, and fun at the same time."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great music, great atmosphere. This is a great place to eat on a date or with a group of friends. All the dishes I tried were delicious. I highly recommend the chicken and waffle, and braised short rib. The Mac and cheese with bacon was ok. I recommend having the meals with a red strip :)"}
{"text":"Came here last night before the raptors game for the first time.   The place is a cute little spot - there was only another table when we got there so the service was very fast. Food that was ordered:   1. Hummus, avacado,  and fried wonton chips to start (why I do not know.. this is what happens when you let your bf pick the app)    - this is exactly what you would expect. the hummus was garlicky but unless you're going to byblos or another Mediterranean restaurant, hummus is hummus   2. fried chicken with rice and peas and collard greens  - fried chicken is crispy but slightly greasy. was semi bland but the housemade hot sauce cured that (and it is legit hot). You got three pieces of fried chicken. collard greens were ho-hum. The rice and peas were good, not enough peas to rice ratio and was jazzed up with the gravy they gave on the side.   3. chicken and waffles.   - same deal with the chicken as above - 3 pieces. the waffle is sweet and soft.   The service was great and our server was really friendly. Overall - there is definitely better fried chicken in the city, but maybe I would come back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"I was here this past Winterlicious 2015 for Saturday lunch. I was in a reservation of 14.   Overall: - service was exceptionally slow - food was pretty good - ambiance hit the mark  - longest 2.5hr restaurant lunch I've ever had - had to extend parking twice  Apps: - deep fried pickles are always a hit - deep fried okra was limp and a bit stale, coming from an okra enthusiast - the corn bread was recommended by the waitress but they were nothing special and the portion sizes were inconsistent.   Mains: - Jerk loaf was said to be pretty good but this meal arrived 15mins before anyone elses' - Jerk sandwich portion was sizeable and also pretty good - chicken and waffles was the most popular order of the group. Was reported to be good but not as good as fast food.  - curried veg stew was a hearty and tasty portion that I had no complaints about  Dessert: - candied plantains were undercooked and underwhelming - chocolate ganache was wayyyy too sweet   Service: - two thumbs down - brought us enough water to sip sparingly - brought us wrong orders - certainly not timely - other tables were waiting as well - when we complained we were told to just not tip"}
{"text":"Good place to try fried chicken and wafflesbut the food is not consistent. Been here four times since close proximity to home but liked the food only half the time."}
{"text":"What a gem! I had an excellent meal here. The sauce they used for the chicken was out of this world. I wish I could bottle it. Small cute restaurant - perfect for a date. Quiet but still lively. Corn bread was great too! Menus are on old records which is neat. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious Lunch special on Tuesday the 9th.  Order the Jerk Chicken Sandwich, other parties at my table all order the Chicken and waffles.   I can say they all enjoyed their meal and the portion was amazing.   The Jerk Chicken Sandwich on the other hand can only be described as a joke, it was a bun with some sauce in it, could only distinguish I small piece of plantain, couple tiny scraps of chicken mixed in. and on the side a pile of lettuce as a garnish with no dressing.   Weird side when the meal came with a salad to start.  The flavour could hardly be called Jerk, it was extremely disappointing. Mayo on a bun,  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Fellow yelper Terry \"P-town\" recommended this place for our brunch and unlike his selection in furniture stores, it was great.   I had the western 'Omelette du Jour' that was accompanied with a green salad and biscuit. My omelette was fluffy and they didn't skimp on the filling. Brunch is an excuse for alcohol in the afternoon so we both had a martini, which was mixed well (aka lots of booze).    I'd definitely come here again. It has a nice local, trendy feel. P-town complained about the humidity in the restaurant and I agree. They had multiple fans but none were turned on. Aside from that, great place for a Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"It was a good experience. The ambiance was good, I like eating in the alley way and surprisingly it was very clean. Food took a while but very unique flavour. When I was there there was a great soul performer upstairs, not sure if they have live music every week."}
{"text":"All I gotta say... Soul Food in Toronto! Can't go wrong here people!   A very very comforting venue. Great service! I feel once you want in, they treat you like family. Chefs will come out and talk to the guests. They explain the ingredients, how it's prepared, spices, etc etc.   ** I recommend going on a Friday or Saturday. No hit against the \"other\" chef, but they have differences in preparation and presentation. Friday and Saturday, is the main chef. AND go for the Dinner menu. The lunch menu doesn't offer the same items as the Dinner menu.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND... - Avocado Hummus & Spiced Walnut Pate ($7) - Jerk Chicken Quesadillas ($10) - Mac N' Cheese ($5.50) - Harlem Jambalaya ($20) - Jerk Beef Meatloaf ($17) - Southern Fried Chicken ($17)"}
{"text":"Made Winterlicious reservations with my co-worker who has never tried Southern style food before.  I've been here for Summerlicious/Winterlicious and on a regular days in the past.  The restaurant is fairly small as the main floor sits about 34 people.  We were seated on the main floor which was almost at capacity as this place is quite busy during Summerlicious/Winterlicious from previous experiences.  There is a bar and a stage upstairs for live performances that usually happen on weekends.    There were only 2 waiters so we had to flag one down to place our order as we had about an hour for lunch.  I ordered the Cornbread, Southern Chicken & Waffles, and Brownie Cookies.  My co-worker had the Arugula & Beet Salad, Southern Chicken & Waffles (because she never tried it before and I convinced her she had to) and Mini Red Velvet Cake.  $18 + Tax & Gratuity.  Gratuity was included in the bill and was calculated \"before\" tax rather than after tax that some places do.  (Thumbs Up!)  Cornbread - fresh in house made Cornbread mini loaf *vegetarian*.  The cornbread was warm, soft slightly sweet, and moist.  It comes with butter on the side, but it's already delicious without it (I put some on anyways).  Southern Chicken & Waffles - Paired with scotch-bonnet-coriander lime syrup & homemade gravy.  This was the best part of the meal.  It comes with a chicken leg split in half (thigh and drum), lightly breaded and fried.  Chicken was moist and the outer layer was crisp and seasoned well.  The waffles were golden brown, slightly crispy outside and fluffy inside.  Comes with a side of arugula salad which is the same as the appetizer my co-worker ordered.  Although the description says the syrup contains scotch-bonnet, it is not spicy at all.  No homemade gravy, but comes with sweet thai chilli sauce on the side.  For those that like to play with fire in their mouth see *FIRE* below.  Brownie Cookies - Soft, melt in your mouth chocolate cookies, served with vanilla ice cream perfect for dipping & dunking *vegetarian*.  Came with 2 pieces of cake which was slightly warm, not too sweet and moist.  The ice cream wasn't good quality as it was more icy than creamy texture.    Arugula & Beet Salad - Arugula, beets, goat cheese & walnuts tossed in a white wine & Dijon mustard vinaigrette *vegetarian*.  This was a great tasting and healthy salad as the ingredients worked well together.  The vinaigrette has some sweetness and not overly sour at all.    Red Velvet Cake - Southern style red velvet cake with cream cheese icing *vegetarian*.  The cake was kind of dry compared to my brownie so it definitely needed to be dipped into the unimpressive ice cream. Service was fairly quick as our food came out in almost no time considering the restaurant was near full.    *FIRE* If you really want some heat, ask them for their hot sauce.  It's a scotch bonnet and mango pure sauce.  You won't taste the heat initially after you take the first bite, it'll take about a minute to kick in.  This is where people try more and more until they go past their limit and start sweating and chugging water (happened to my friends in the past).     Other things I recommend:  Fish-N-Chips- Two pieces of seasoned catfish in a beer batter swimming alongside sweet potato fries and spicy Tartar sauce.  I enjoyed this the last few times I ordered it. Comes with sweet potato fries which I really like.  Usually Fish-N-Chips comes with just regular fries and you would have to pay a few bucks to upgrade it.    Bacon Mac-N-Cheese - this place has great mac-n-cheese.  You won't be able to eat Kraft Dinner mac-n-cheese after eating this.  Also, the bacon makes it even more awesome.    Took 1 star off because: -the red velvet cake was dry -some better quality ice cream could have been used in the two desserts that we ordered All in all, a pretty good deal for Winterlicious considering the $18 price point in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was here for my birthday dinner a few years ago, with work people more recently, with friends over the summer and also once with a former flame, a somewhat experienced cornbread eater/critic, who declared that this was the best cornbread he had ever eaten. Each time I've been to Harlem has been a pleasure. I like the laid-back vibe, the great music they play and of course, the scrumptious FOOD! I haven't been dissatisfied with anything I've eaten here. The Catfish Lafayette - oh lord, YUM. Tangy deliciousness to the max. This is comfort food with flare. I have yet to try their brunch but am tempted."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious 2015... Food was OK, I've had better in Miami.  Portions were really big to say the least.  If I were to come back for the Summerlicious menu, I would skip the Jambalaya, and instead get another order of Chicken and Waffles.  We ordered half an order of Sangria, and couldn't even finish it.  Overall, value is great, but the food is nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"...nice atmosphere, wonderful waitress, has even got a tv in their patio seating area that they bring back in every night.   my review is unfortunately slightly biased as my first fried chicken and waffle experience in Toronto was The Harlem Underground on queen street west. while they both are really great and made the exact same way, the chicken here is not as well battered. There were parts of the chicken missing batter therefore causing the chicken to overcook in the oil and become dry and hard. also, the scotch bonnet sauce was served on the chicken rather an on the side. i don't mind it, I would rather the choice though.   I'd give a 3.5star if yelp allowed it."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times to this easy-to-walk-by joint, came recently with friends for dinner.  First of all, the service is excellent.  The girl was working by herself but managed well and was super friendly.  We enjoyed the daily deal on the rum punch.  Food was mostly a hit with a couple of misses.  Fried Chicken looked great and plentiful with a couple of sides.  We got the chicken and waffles, almost the same as the other meal but with no sides so we ordered a couple and a salad.  Chicken was excellent but the misses (and I think they're important) were the mac n cheese (watery and just not good!) and the cornbread (4 small pieces for $5?).  Salad wasn't amazing but it's not their specialty so I can't complain.  Overall, a really nice intimate place for dinner.  They do live music on the weekends in the beautiful room upstairs."}
{"text":"I was glad that my old friend from way back had our time to reconnect here. The place had a very laid back bar setting with outdoor seating at the far back and a giant window patio seating at the front.  We went at 4 PM on a Thursday right as they opened and pretty much had the place to ourselves. The service was average nothing to complain or praise about but the staff was nice and friendly.  We both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle meal served with a scotch-bonet-corriander-lime syrup and gravy that also came with a small serving of garden salad. We also ordered the Mac-N-Cheese as a side.  The Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle meal was excellent. The two pieces of chicken was juicy and tender and perfectly crispy. It could have maybe been a little more flavourful in my opinion but was still really good! The waffles on the other hand was all-round perfect. Soft, light and spongy with a bit of chew to it so it's not like you're just eating air.  The two sauces that came with the meal was excellent, I actually used them both, they complement the flavour of the meal altogether. The salad was just your basic garden salad.  The Mac-N-Cheese side was tasty! The cheese to macaroni ratio was 2:1 meaning that it was perfectly cheesy and creamy having a nice baked crust of cheese on the top. Definitely would have ordered an extra. I regret not doing it.   Overall the experience was really good. Had lots of laughs with good company and food. Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Harlem. I had heard from a friend and read in some yelp reviews that the food is great and the vibe matches. I visited this past Saturday during my time in Toronto and must say that it was very pleasant. I made a reservation before the trip (which I probably didn't need to do because there were tables available) but I didn't mind. I'm pretty sure the space fills very quickly in the evenings when there are performances.  The food was good. I had a jerk chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. My girl had a fish sandwich and ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. We were stuffed! They had some tasty sauce in addition to the ketchup that added a different type of flavor.  Unfortunately I do not remember our waitresses name but she was very kind and helpful. She also gave us the tip to park near the restaurant and walk to the subway so that we could avoid paying exorbitant fees for parking when visiting the air Canada centre. That was great because we were able to experience the subway and not have to worry about traffic leaving the arena."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend. Walked in and immediately felt a jazzy vibe. The decor was very nice but it looked a little dusty. We were seated almost immediately, but unfortunately for us, there was only one waiter for eight tables. We waited twenty minutes for him to take our drink orders. During that wait, we also decided what we wanted to order. The food seemed very over priced, considering this place was a sort of hole in the wall, and not anywhere that could get away with charging $22 for Jambalaya. We ordered the Jerk Chicken Quesadilla, some Corn bread, and the bacon mac 'n' cheese. The food came out surprisingly fast. The Jerk chicken was delicious. Just the right amount of spice to not make it too overpowering of a sauce. The bacon mac was good, but nothing to write home about. Could have been a little more generous with amount of bacon we received. The cornbread should have been $3 instead of $5, as the portion was very tiny and nothing too special.   On a side note, we overheard our waiter telling other customers that the chef gets annoyed when someone wants to change a part of their order (no collard greens, etc) and would not let them change anything on the menu... Not very good customer service. Who do they think they are?"}
{"text":"Perfect for comfort food. Harlem features soul food-some of the best fried chicken in Toronto ( love the crust and the spicing), awesome candied yams, mac n cheese to other stick to your ribs fare. The food is nicely done here though it can be somewhat of a wait at times with a one man kitchen and service is sometimes off, especially with big groups present or the nightclub upstairs open. That being said, this is the place I go to for my Soul food in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this \"lower east side\" establishment. This visit was triggered by a craving for fried chicken which I neglected to try the first time around. Overall, a disappointment, the chicken was just ok, something you could easily replicate at home. Mac and cheese was not bad, but again, nothing to write home about. Won't be making a return trip any time soon."}
{"text":"Apps we had: seafood fondue, catfish lafayette, short ribs - all were delicious and generous portions  Entrees: short ribs, jambalaya, coconut fettuccini, chicken n waffles - also all delicious and generous portions! I usually finish all my food but couldn't finish my fettuccini. The mac n cheese side that my friend had was also very cheesy & tasty. My friend who has the chicken/waffles got 4 pieces of waffles and he was very happy with his dish.  Cons: customer service was slow BUT very friendly, I LOVED our waitress, she was hilarious! I also had their red velvet cake but very disappointed, but I wasn't there for their dessert.  4 ppl w/alcohol: our bill came out to $176 (after tax, before tip)"}
{"text":"I had always heard great reviews about Harlem. I already loved going to Irie's Food Joint, Harlem's sister restaurant on Queen. My friends decided to take me to a surprise dinner at Harlem's so I was not only thrilled by the surprise but ready to try some good soul food.  The decor is reminiscent of Irie's with the hair portraits on the wall. They really are amazing art but the pictures slightly freak me out (I mean, where on the human body is the hair from? *slight shudder*).  I ordered the BBQ chicken and a side of mac and cheese. We also got drinks first. I wasn't really a fan of what my friends had ordered for me (which I could remember!) but the food made up for it. The BBQ chicken was heavenly. The meat fell off the bone and the BBQ sauce was finger-lickin' good. I was so stuffed that I almost didn't try the mac and cheese. I told myself I would only have a bit because it looked very watery and the cheese looked more white than yellow. But one bite had me hooked and I soon cleaned that bowl. I wasn't a fan of the cornbread but I think that's because American cornbread & West Indian cornbread are made very differently so my palette was a bit judgmental for that.  We were there on a Sunday and the owner and chef came out to talk to us and ask us if everything was okay. He invited us upstairs for a free birthday drink and, never to pass on something FREE, we all finished our meals and headed upstairs. There was a live R&B/Jazz band, which was a real treat. We couldn't stay long but we enjoyed our drink with the owner and listened to a bit of music. It was a great atmosphere with the musicians interacting with the audience--they even called out to us when we all got up to leave!  All and all, I had a great birthday dinner and would definitely go back to Harlem again."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Jamaican restaurants I've ever been to. Beautiful location! I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious, affordable, authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"I was about to dine at Harlem (Saturday September 13th, 2014) when a mouse crawled across the dining area floor.  When the server was informed about the mouse and observed it herself, she replied \"I don't know what to do\".   I tried contacting DineSafe, but since it is not regular business hours I am unable to contact them. Alternate contact numbers they provide for outside business hours informed me that they don't deal with this type of situation."}
{"text":"I had written a review recently and have decided to update it since having dinner there twice. Harlem is quickly becoming a firm favourite...southern fried chicken is fantastic as is the jerk chicken, corn bread is stil sweet and delicious. I ate so much tonight that I thought I might end up in a food coma! Had the southern fried chicken and waffles...collard greens on the side, love collard greens so I am a happy gal!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm just picky being from Atlanta. But my experience here was awful!  First the service was minimal! Sure I understand it's 'licious time but seriously? You can't prepare for that? The staff acted like this foodie event hit them out of nowhere. We waited 45 minutes for our table and were given the wrong menus. Arriving at a restaurant at 7:00 would show people I'm here for dinner yes? Nope! We were presented with the lunch menu.   After getting the proper menu we ordered. I started off with the cornbread and it was alright. 3 little pieces with few dabs of butter. Not bad! For my entree I had the fried chicken and waffles. Before I start let me just say- in no way was I expecting fried chicken and waffles like Meema (grandmother) cooks at home.. But, some pride in it! What I got? Grossness. There's no spice in the glaze or batter. The batter was not crisp at all. How can you call that fried chicken? Your waffles are one step above Eggos. In one word: bottom! Bottom of the chain for chicken and waffles. I was offended as a southerner to even be presented that.  Summary: Won't be catching me here again! That's for sure and good luck to anyone who goes. Everyone's taste buds are different but, take it from a true southerner... Say no to the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Stood at the front door ignored by all the staff and wouldn't have even been spoken too if I didn't take the initiative to ask them if we were to seat our selves. After that point we stood there and watched the staff shine glasses for another 5 minutes instead of even checking for seating. I've been to this location before and the food is good but the service is horrible and the manager should be fired."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: love it. Cozy with lots of character. Service: incredible.  Food: tasty, tasty. I got the Harlem benny for brunch and was very pleased, indeed.   If I lived in Toronto, I'd be back all the time! Loved it here!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, the food was average, had the chicken and waffles but after being in Harlem for real and having real chicken and waffles, this place just can't compare. The service was great though, very helpful and very nice."}
{"text":"Tried brunch at the ither location once and thought I would give this location a shot. The vibe is great...really friendly service, casual welcoming vibe with awesome music. The food was delicious and generous portions. I would give it 5 stars but it is a tad expensive. Although in all fairness I assume their rent is quite high giving their locations. Brunch and lunch is much more affordable and I will definitely come back for those."}
{"text":"Great Carribean/Southern fusion restaurant! Came here during a girls trip for brunch and was blown away by the food, awesome service, and ambience."}
{"text":"First time trying the chicken and waffles, I was a bit sceptical at first but it turned out to be amazing. Crispy fried chicken and light fluffy waffles. Make sure to try the mango hotsauce, oh how it burns. Definitely cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, good music and still have to give it 1 star because the service was absolutely atrocious. Didn't bring anything on time, we waited forever for food, waiter was rude and not accommodating and stopped serving my friend on her birthday after she had two drinks and two shots! Let me be clear they didn't cut her off they just forgot to bring the drinks we ordered for her."}
{"text":"came for dinner with another couple and sat on the side patio... sits inbetween two buildings so while it was a little chilly out the patio was sheltered... had the plantains, pork ribs, spring rolls and catfish apps to start... plantains were more like a desert than an app... spring rolls were blah but the catfish and ribs were great.... had the braised ribs (best dish of the night) jambalaya (excellent version) chicken and waffles (i still have no clue about the allure of this dish... but the chicken was good!) and jerk meatloaf... (was okay...)... was a great meal with the exception of a side of mac and cheese which were pretty awful... skip that and youre in for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first Summerlicious of 2014. I had the opportunity to eat at this place when my friend suggested to eat here for a birthday dinner.  My first impression was that the decor was fantastic, a warm ambiance of orange wallpaper with artworks that ties the whole Cajun-type culture together. They had a live band playing upstairs which was something I really liked.  We sat in the booth inside the restaurant and started off with a Sangria pitcher. The Sangria was more fruity than the one's I've tried from other restaurants, so if you prefer a more fruity flavour than taste of alcohol, this Sangria would suffice.  The waiters and waitress were very friendly and fairly prompt with our orders, however, what bothered me was that because it's summer, I guess they wanted to make the whole restaurant into a somewhat patio-style. There were so many fruit flies that were flying near our drinks and there was no air conditioning.  Appetizers: Mandarin Spinach Salad and Catfish Lafayette. The salad had really sweet mandarins which I like however, the spinach did not look as fresh as I would've like it to be as the spinach had darker spots.  The Catfish was fried and had sweet chili sauce that you can dip it into. It was drench in oil and it tasted like your standard, chicken bits that you receive as pub food.  Main: Southern Fried Chicken Waffles, Jambalaya, Blackened Catfish, and Jerk Beef Meatloaf. The Southern Fried Chicken was cooked very well with a sweet plum-like coating around the fried part. As for the waffles, it was more or less bland, and not sweet, however it is fluffy and thick. The Jambalaya had a tangy and spicy flavour (my least favourite) because the richness in the spicy and tang was not very complimenting and left an aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Portion was very reasonable. Jerk Beef Meatloaf was savoury enough however, it was paired with rice and apply chutney, the apply chutney was too sweet for me with the fact that the meat loaf was cooked really well with their sauce.  Dessert: Mango Cream Tarts They served a mango cream tart no bigger than 10cm in diameter. It tasted like mango mousse with a splash of tang. Tasted pretty good, but not amazing in my opinion.  Loved: - the Staff - dessert - ambiance of the restaurant - live band - sangria  Disappointed: - Jambalaya - Appetizers - fruit flies (due to open windows)  Not interested in coming back unless I'm around wanting to listen to the live bands."}
{"text":"Food was okay all in all. Deep fried pickles were cool, but the spring rolls were terrible and just tasted like deep fryer oil. Fried chicken was really good, although accompanying mac+cheese was a bit on the dry side, didn't seem freshly made just freshly warmed. Salmon was apparently disappointing and tasted \"cheap and fishy\".  We sat on the patio which was pretty cool, although for some reason despite being the first to arrive, and with a reservation, the hostess/waitress still separated our tables from the table of 4 rather than just letting us sit with the extra space to work with.  Not impressed on the whole, but I'd imagine coming when there is live jazz music would definitely make this a more memorable outing."}
{"text":"If this restaurant was rated on food alone, their score would be much higher. Unfortunately, the slow service, long wait for a table (despite our reservation!) long wait for a server to take our order, long wait to get our drinks, long wait for our food, rude servers, and their listless, blase, and unconcerned attitude brings them to a 1 out of 5. There are millions of restaurants in Toronto with better food and better service. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I came here with friends, and wanted to try their chicken and waffles for brunch.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it, and wished I had chosen another place to try.  Although the chicken was crispy, it lacked flavour. The waffle itself was also very plain and only had some maple syrup on it."}
{"text":"Tried Harlem Restaurant for the first time.   Starting with the atmosphere of the restaurant, there are two floors. Both floors have a very cozy and nice atmosphere. Tonight there was an event on the second floor and the second floor is more bar-ish than a restaurant with high tables and bar stools. Bar stools were very uncomfortable, with the bar stools on the inside having no back at all. Music was live but extremely loud so we went downstairs instead because we had to yell to hear one another.   The first floor had proper reggae music playing but it was over powered by the loud live music which made it a bit pointless. The servers were very quick with receiving our orders but unfortunately, they got our order wrong.   I ordered the chicken and waffles and my fiancée ordered a spinach and goat cheese salad with salmon on top with the sauce on the side.   My food came about 5 minutes before my fiancée's food which isn't too bad. My portion was embarrassingly small. Two small pieces of chicken and a Belgian waffle cut into four pieces. The chicken was alright, nothing special but the waffle was awful. It was extremely mushy and tasted awful. My fiancée's food came out and they got the order wrong. It was a salad with mandarins and some other things and the sauce was mixed into it as opposed to the side like she requested. We brought it up to the server and she wasn't too happy...not sure why because it was her mistake. She goes \"did you want me to just have the mandarins removed?\" and we told her no, we want it re-made because of the sauce. She goes to the back and comes back with the same salad with the mandarin's removed and the sauce still mixed. At this point we became frustrated and asked for the bill so that we could leave.   Luckily, the server said we did not have to pay for the food and that is the only reason why I'm giving this place two stars, not one."}
{"text":"Not much open in this area on a Sunday so we decided to dropped by Harlem for lunch.   They've upped their game from my last visit. I had the Catfish Niciose salad. Fish was perfect, not over done, with good seasoning. Salad was generous in portion, fresh, and lightly 'dressed'. Lunch was reasonably priced.   Service friendly and accommodating.  3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"I was really hungry and passed by this place and decided to give it a try. They had a nice patio and the service was good and friendly. The girl was helpful in assisting me in picking a meal from their record shaped menus."}
{"text":"I had fried chicken and a side of Mac n cheese. The fried chicken tasted good, big portions. The Mac n cheese however was KD style and did not taste authentic. The atmosphere is nice,The band was playing upstairs. I wish we would have sat upstairs. The menus were out dated and had black marker crossing out old prices/items, kind of ghetto. The server was friendly but something definitely feels off about this place. Not the best dining experience. It seems like it needs one of those restaurant make overs/ investors to help take this place to new heights."}
{"text":"My first time trying chicken and waffles! BUT I know how good waffles and good southern chickens are supposed to taste like.   There was also an upstairs where they have live performances and a bar.  When we got there, Saturday dinner, the downstairs was already packed so the waitress directed us to up stair where nobody was present. We got seated and ordered which was a smooth process. However, as we were eating, more people came upstairs for the performance. I did not mind live performance, but we were sitting right under two speakers which were blasting the music. We had to yell at each other although the table was very narrow because it was stools and bar kind of thing.   The food was good. The first bite of the chicken was the highlight of the dish. It was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The batter was seasoned perfectly! My green salad which was already included in the dish, was not fresh though. And I did not like how the chili sauce and the syrup were served in plastic containers....   I am still giving four stars because chicken and waffles were good. But if I am ever going back, I need to make sure I sit downstairs."}
{"text":"I came here after searching for my first experience of Soul Food and sadly I left disappointed.   Overall: The service was extremely slow, I mean 2 hour dinner was way too long but the servers were funny and very courteous. The ambiance was great, they had a live band playing during dinner while was quite nice.  The food wasn't anything special. Their \"famous\" mac and cheese was grease and cold and didn't have a lot going on with it. The I had the jerk chicken which had some good favour but left me wanting more. There was nothing I had on the menu that left me wanting more or trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Health code violations out the wazoo. This food was so bad, i ordered the jerk chicken pasta & it was old and mouldy. It was so disgusting, it smelled bad the pasta was definitely cooked 2 weeks ago and kept in the freezer, the sauce and chicken was spoiled and they still served it. It was DISRESPECTFUL, in the words of my date who tasted it."}
{"text":"The restaurant gets 2 stars solely based on the decor and love band. The customer service and food was subpar."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable meal at Harlem with a couple friends a week back. Harlem serves up Southern comfort food: candied yams, fried chicken, ribs, etc. The food was all very tasty. I'd recommend the fried chicken: it was crispy and delicious. They have a reasonably large cocktail menu, but no beers on tap. Still, it's probably a nice place to sit and have a few drinks, even if you aren't interested in eating. The place isn't loud, making it a nice place to talk. Upstairs there is a larger seating area, and also a stage where performers can play. When we were there a lady singing jazz, accompanied by a guitarist. Harlem is well worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago with a girlfriend.  I had the fried chicken with mac and cheese again.  The chicken was super tasty as per usual - you get 3 pieces - so you won't be hungry!    We shared an order of the cornbread which had a bit of kick.  It was really good.  I could eat a whole basket full.    The main reason for this update though is because the mac and cheese has changed.  It used to be my fave in the city, but it's not as good.  It's still tasty, but they've done something different.  Maybe they used milk instead of cream, or a processed cheese - it just didn't live up to the other times I had come.  Bring the old mac and cheese back!!!"}
{"text":"I chose to eat at Harlem because there was a considerable amount of hype towards harlem from my social circle.  Loved the ambiance of Harlem and the service was nothing short of incredible. Sadly, the food fell short of the high expectations I had. I may still go back for a second chance."}
{"text":"4 of us went to Harlem last night for Summerliscious and sat on the patio. I had the jambalaya which was quite nice. Weird thing was my bud ordered the same thing and his came in a bowl which sat on a plate. Mine came on the plate that the bowl was supposed to be on. The service was pretty slow all night. It took 10 mins to get our first round of drinks and I had to waive our server down to get more. Overall the food was pretty tasty although the candied plantains had zero presentation so it looked like a pile of rotten plantains. Not sure I'd have a desire to go back with the service we received."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this past weekend. Food is great lots of flavour... And have the Mac and cheese with bacon"}
{"text":"Two things you can do at Harlem for relatively little money? Warm your soul and fill your stomach. With plantains a plenty, fish and chips, mac and cheese and corn fritters on the menu, there's little way to deny the comfort-food focus--a welcome diversion from fancy foods during a chilly winter afternoon.  Easy going vibes and service that's friendly but bordering on slow, Harlem provided a cozy escape from the cold during a busy lunch hour. The food is very good, from the sweet plantains appetizer and the \"Nice Lady\" sandwich (pressed into a crisp wrap), to the  fish & chips (served with vinegary coleslaw and thick sweet potato chips). That last dish was clearly the winner of the three, and isn't always available, so get it while you can!  The hair art is interesting and no doubt creative, but it's hardly what I want to have in my face while eating. Thoughts of pieces making their way into my food never really left my mind while trying to enjoy my lunch."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious - they ditched their full menu and only offered the prix fixe menu - but it had plenty of options including their outstanding chicken and waffles. I don't really get how soul food, Jamaican food, and Cajun food really go together - but they do. We mixed it up well - chicken and waffles with an awesome pepper sauce, fried catfish Lafayette, and fried pickles. All good stuff.  I want to pull a star for their not having draft beer, but that seems petty. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to eat here based on the Yelp reviews. Thank goodness I followed my instincts and came here anyway. This place functions as a restaurant on the main level, with live music and food on the 2nd level. I had the beef short ribs, collard greens, and bacon mac-n-cheese. Everything was delicious. My friend ordered the fried chicken dinner with a side of candied plantains. The plantains were perfect. The fried chicken was good, but I like a little more kick to my fried chicken.   The only con was that the service was incredibly slow. I think the same server was working both floors. He was literally the only person serving all of the tables on the main level, and carrying food upstairs."}
{"text":"Harlem is a family run business and may seem like a hole in the wall when you pull up but it has lots of charm inside! You can tell their love put into it.  The owner is very accommodating and friendly! We were in a big group and wanted to try a few dishes, so she brought food to our table family style!   The Candied Plantains are really good! I found them a little bit \"mushy\" but they are candied so they were still delicious!  Cajun Smoked Ribs! They are really good!! They are not the fall off the bone type but still tender and full of flavour!  Chicken and Waffles The chicken is crispy and delicious! The waffles are just okay I found.  Not that flavourful but has a good texture.  It's not too soft like fancy breakfast spots, but comes out more crispy which is good for eating fried chicken with syrup on them!  Mac and Cheese We really wanted to Mac and Cheese so we got a round of it! It's surprisingly great! Something about the mixture of fried chicken, mac and cheese, and coconut rice is comforting! If they ask if you want bacon with that, the answer is always YES!  Corn Bread Must try! Very flavourful and fluffy!  I took one star off because sometimes there are consistency issues. At worst it is a good spot, but typically it is excellent! The service can sometimes be slow but they are nice people, so just be patient and nice with them and they will be nice and accommodating to you! :)"}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5, but let's round up, shall we? I really wish it were a full 4, but there were a few unfortunate setbacks.  First let's start with the good. I love the concept and it's nice to do something different. 'Soul food' fits the bill. The jerk chicken quasadillas (an app) were very good, as were the mixed drinks. I had the Tequila Sunrise and it was perfectly sweet and salty. For a main, I had the fried chicken and waffles (a novel combination) and liked the chicken, but it could have been spicier. My partner had the Guinness chicken and seemed to really enjoy it, confirming it had more kick.  Now, the bad. My fried chicken was supposed to be accompanied with two sauces I did not receive. Not sure what happened there, but I was looking forward to the gravy and special plum sauce. I didn't realize they were missing until well into the meal; otherwise, I would have asked for them. I also was not impressed by my partner's mac & cheese. It was pretty bland and below expectation at a place like this. The corn bread was a little odd, and I wouldn't order that again either.  All in all, I would definitely return to try other items, and as I said, it's a nice change from traditional American/Indian/Thai/etc. fare."}
{"text":"I went here for Summerlicious and had the three-course meal where I chose the deep fried okra as the appetizer, fish n chips for main course, and fried plantains for dessert.   The deep fried okra was nice. The okra was soft and the deep fried coating was perfectly crunchy with a nice spicy mayo that accompanied it.  The fish n chips were the worst part of the meal for me. Fish n chips was very undercooked to the point where I questioned if it was fully cooked through. The breading on the outside was very soft and the opposite of the very crunchy deep fried okra.   The servers were very nice and when they forgot to give our desserts allowed us to have any drink on the menu free for the inconvenience. The meal was $18 for lunch, and the lackluster food is what really pulled down the meal.  Weak 2/5"}
{"text":"CHICKEN AND WAFFLES  So delicious. It was the best fried chicken I've ever had and the syrup for the waffles was awesome and flavored- not your average syrup. Mac and cheese was excellent, cheesey and not mushy.  Cocktails and great and portions are generous"}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Called in here while in town for a conference after reading some good reviews and ordered the chicken 'n' waffles with an extra piece of chicken. The guy on the phone was very friendly. Got there, food was ready and he indicated he had put the extra piece of chicken in for me but didn't charge anything additional. Nice guy! He even double-checked with the kitchen before I left that the extra piece was in there. Told me there was extra syrup too but there was not - alas ya can't win 'em all.   Food - Chicken was flavourful and well-cooked. Waffles were soggy but I suspect that's my own fault as I think it would be pretty unlikely to get a take-out waffle home after a stroll in a box and have it crisp. Overall I enjoyed the food - syrup was tasty and the gravy was good stuff. Service made the trip worthwhile.  Not quite up there with Stockyards IMO for the chick'n'waffs but delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Was here a while back for summerlicious. There was a blues band upstairs and the ambience was great, but the food wasn't.  The meatloaf was a bit bland, but enjoyable. However, the friend chicken and waffles was dry and borderline flavourless (both the chicken and waffles).   If you want fried chicken that fall off the bone and melts in your mouth, get up to the Stockyards - that's the real deal."}
{"text":"We came here for Summerlicious dinner and for $40 it was not worth it at all!  The appetizer - catfish was fine. The sauce was store bought, nothing special. The batter was a little soggy, but we weren't disappointed.  The main was a huge disappointment: the Harlem jambalaya. I really tried to like it, but the rice was soggy, the spices weren't there. The catfish sat sadly a top. There were basically no other ingredients in the rice. It was only rice and occasionally a piece of chicken. It was such a disappointment. It tasted like the packs of minute rice with spices...  The chicken and waffle was fine, though as mentioned by other Yelpers- the syrup was 100% Aunt Jemima. There was definitely no bourbon infused maple syrup. The chicken was deep-fried to crispiness, and the seasoning was delicious. The waffle was fluffy and very very light- if you're into that. I prefer a little density in mine.  The dessert was gross. I got the bread pudding and it was ROCK hard and the raisin bits I hated. My friend's brownie was fine- a little thin, but much better than the bread pudding.  100% will not return, and 100% will not recommend it to anybody. The service was fine, so we tipped over the mandatory 15%."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be there during a quiet moment and enjoyed every bit of it!  The staff were super friendly and very helpful, great customer service.  The food was amazing!  I had the chicken quesadilla and the chicken & waffles - both were fantastic!  I was told that if I ate nothing else, I needed to try the mac-n-cheese, so I did.  I've never been a huge fan of mac-n-cheese, so I can't give a fair judgement as to whether it was fantastic or not, but I definitely enjoyed how cheesy it was.  Overall, a great experience, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Harlem - a hole in the wall on the outside, but special in the inside. A family run business, Harlem is known for it's southern fried chicken with waffles, art and live music.   My girlfriend and I came here for summerlicious. For $15 we tried the deep fried okra and corn bread as apps. The corn bread was amazing - moist, flavorful and served warm! The okra was not my flavor, but definitely worth a try for those vegetarians out there or those trying something new. For entrees we got the fried chicken and waffles. If you like your fried chicken plain, make sure to request the spicy sauce they add on top on the side. The chicken was crispy and juicy, but could have used an extra dash of seasoning. But because the presentation was so beautiful and the food came out quick, we couldn't complain. And last but not least, we got the candied plantain and the chocolate cookie. The desserts were great to try as part of the summerlicious menu, but would we order it again...most likely not.   Overall, good experience was had here and would probably come here again for a second shot of the fried chicken."}
{"text":"If I could rate it lower, I would. It was a complete and utter waste of our time. We went for Winterliscious 2015.....for some reason you could only order the winterliscious menu....their regular menu was suspended during this event. For $25, we figured it wouldn't be bad.  The Good * catfish appetizer was very good and there was plenty of them. It was, perhaps, the hi-lite of a pretty dismal meal. * our waiter was attentive and humorous. Staff who cleared tables always ensured you were done eating before removing plates. * food was paced well between courses * jambalaya was good (or so said the person who ordered it) * bottle of Pinot was reasonably priced  The Bad * made a reservation for 5 ppl......all they did was add a chair to a 4 person table, so the 5th person was seated in the aisle. Not cool, as he was hit by people going to the washroom, servers bringing out food, etc...plus the table was crowded once plates were placed on it. * my appetizer of 4 small slices of cornbread was a joke. It was microscopic, dried out and bland. How could they call this an appetizer...it should come on the plate with the meal. When it was put down in front of me, two people at the table actually laughed at how small it was (and no man wants a table of people pointing, laughing and calling something small .....lol)  * the fried chicken was flavourless, with a capital F. Utterly disappointing...this is NOT southern cooking.  * the syrup for the waffle, was not as described on the menu. It tasted like the syrup you get at McDonalds when you order hot cakes.  The waffle itself was ok...I've had better and I've had worse. * we all wanted the coconut tart for dessert, but they were out (at 6:30pm.). Instead, we ordered the chocolate tart. It was; a) not a tart; b) I've purchased this exact dessert at Costco (it's sold there with lemon bars, brownies and what they served us (maple and coconut bar); c) the chocolate ganache was chocolate sauce drizzled on top of the maple bar; and d) the dessert was described as a chocolate tart with chocolate ganache...yet the bar that came was maple/coconut flavoured...not what was listed and not what was ordered. WTF? * the salad (kale, walnut and pear) came without dressing * the jerk meatloaf was dense and flavourless. Even the gravey was dreadful. Further, for a dish such as this, perhaps rice and peas would be a better option than plain, white, basmati rice * the meal sounded wonderful on the menu....did not resemble what we got. all 5 of us felt completely ripped off....even at a $25 price point for 3 courses. * several items were left on our plates...no one asked if everything was ok with the meal....they could really care less.  The 5 of us utilize winterliscious to find hidden gems and bookmark them for a return visit. We will not return to this place."}
{"text":"It was my first visit here and was really excited to come and try the food coz I've heard so much about it. We reached here at 1:21pm and so it's summerlicious didn't have reservations but they still took us in great, they seated us within 3-4 minutes on the patio and the person who seated us was funny and witty to break the ice with us.. Took them 6-8 minutes to give us a menu and 20 minutes to give us water and take our order.. We noticed that there was 2 others guys were seated after us and were served before us menus, water and even orders taken and apps served..  So orders were taken and the server came back and tells us she punched in the order and the order erases so she had to take a order again but offers us a free drink for the inconvenience. We get our app it's been 38 minutes since we got here. I got the fried okra, it was warmish, the sauce need a touch more of spice and the batter for the fried okra could've used a little salt.. We get our complimentary drinks with our mains 10 mins after our apps. I ordered chicken and waffles as a side of collard greens.. Chicken & waffles were worth the wait, it was moist and delicious, the outside batter was crunchy and had a nice flavour, waffles were ok, a tad on the dry side for me. Collard greens were delicious, hot and nice fresh flavour with a touch of butter and fresh garlic. Took a bite of my sisters Mac as cheese it was it was a tad on the bland for side for me. I tried to order a side of corn bread but they told me to wait a bit so I was fine. We finished our mains at 2:40pm.  We waited 30 more minutes for our plate to be cleared and offered dessert. The server realized she forgot our cornbread and offered us a complimentary loaf of the corn bread. I got the candied plantain with a cashew kiss.. Plantain was good wasn't a fan of the cashew kiss.   So overall we finally ended our meal at 3:30pm being there for 2 hours and 9 minutes. I think they needed more help for summerlicious event because I feel that that servers and food runners were very overwhelmed  by the amount of people coming and going for lunch."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try their menu for winterlicious. I went with a few friends and they really enjoyed the atmosphere.  There's two levels, with the top level having a live band. Unfortunately, we got seats on the lower level, which is ok if you want to have conversations without having to yell.   I ordered the Catfish Lafayette as my appetizer. It's pretty much fried fish pieces with a tasty spicy sweet chili sauce. I loved every bite. Deep fried goodness. I only wished I had more. It was a teaser.   My main dish was the blackened catfish with rice and collard greens. I know, fish again. But it was really good. It was topped with this cream based sauce that balanced the pepper on the fish. The only thing is there was too much rice and not enough collard greens.   I contemplated between the brownie and the candied plantains for desert. Both came with ice cream. But, I ordered the brownie, and I've had better. I couldn't finish it. The candied plantains was a better choice. I was able to grab a small bite from a friend's plate.  Overall, nice chill spot to hang with a group of cool peeps and listen to soul music."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Had the roasted jerk chicken sandwich-melts in your mouth. Also ordered the Harlem crisps-while the wonton chips are nothing special the avocado hummus dip was very interesting. The service was a bit slow since they only had one waitress but other that that recommend it."}
{"text":"Kevin F and I had a very enjoyable brunch at Harlem.  I love to try something different, so when I saw fried chicken and waffles on the brunch menu, I knew immediately what I would be having.  The chicken was obviously a little greasy, but very flavourful, and the waffle was a great (and filling) accompaniment.  We were given corn bread while we waited for our meal, which was a nice touch.  Service was casual but polite, and it was definitely a little hot in there.  They have a very small selection of cocktails, but that's all you need (one would hope) at brunch.  Overall, this was a nice relaxing experience, with good food.  I would be interested in giving dinner a try there at some point."}
{"text":"There is nothing Cajun or creole about tgis place. Perhaps my expectations were too high but the food was not up to participate with the high prices. The service was absolutely terrible. The lounge singer was absolutely horrific, and it was not what I would have expected to partake in. It was horrible."}
{"text":"Came here the day before NYE expecting it to be jam-packed so made a reservation - turned out we didn't have to because there were only a few other people being served :P  Resto's first floor was relatively small, I saw stairs leading up but not sure how the upper level decor looked like.  I loved the interior of the resto, it's meant to serve a food with a modern twist of Afro-Caribbean and Afro-American, and the resto definitely had a Caribbean feel to it with the artwork and decor.    FOOD 1) Apps - We got the Catfish Lafayette to start.  The breading was not too thick but very doughy/floury - which I actually liked.  The texture was great and went well with the sweet chili sauce.  I like fish of all sorts, so I couldn't pass this one up.  None of the other apps caught my eye except the smoked side ribs.    2) Ofc for the main I would order the Southern Fried Chicken & Waffles that's been raved about by frequenters of the restaurant.   ... I. Don't. Get. It.  I mean, I ate the chicken and waffles separately... and they tasted just as they are.  Fried chicken.. (albeit with declisious sweet chili sauce) and ..waffles.  Waffles with syrup, but just waffles nonetheless.  I mean, it's supposed to be a soul food served only in specialty restos in cities like Baltimore in the States.  Where's the special?    I just don't get the hype.  I enjoyed the chicken, fine, but beause it's fried and it's hard to go wrong with fried protein plus sweet chili sauce.  But other than that, you might as well save yourself $20 and make some waffles and bake a chicken at home.  3) The other main we ordered was the Irie Coconut Fettucine - DELICIOUS!  Jerk infused chicken and hot Italian sausage smothered in a tomato coconut creme sauce.  This description from the menu sums up the dish perfectly and the creaminess was not overwhelming and was right up my alley.  The sausage was also not spicy and flavoured perfectly.  Harlem was okay.  Maybe I just wasn't very hungry that day, and maybe it just didn't live up to its hype."}
{"text":"After trying the Chicken & Waffles at the affiliated restaurant Harlem Underground (on Queen St W), I came here to have them again because they were so good! I'm not sure how many places in Toronto serve Chicken & Waffles but I can't imagine any being better than here. I came here on a Saturday night for dinner, with plans to enjoy some live jazz which is performed on select days upstairs, and the chicken came with sweet chili sauce drizzled over top and some cooked greens on the side. When I had the dish at Harlem Underground, it came with syrup, gravy, and sweet chili sauce. I'm not sure if the difference in how the dish was served was due to the time of day or the difference between one location to another. Either way it was delicious both times! I don't think I've had better fried chicken in my life. I spent 8 days in Toronto and this was the best meal I had."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for summerlicious lunch. It's a cute place that has a fun patio area with a cool graffiti wall. We sat inside though since it was a brutally hot day. Our table was ready at 1pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was half full, which we didn't mind since we could actually hear each other talk.  For appetizers, we had the deep fried pickles and the corn bread, both of which were okay but we've had better elsewhere in terms of flavour. For entrees, we had the jerk chicken sammie and the chicken and waffles. The jerk chicken sammie had a few pieces of chicken in it but should have had more. The chicken and waffles entree was more than enough for one though - husband to the rescue! Flavour wise - again, both were okay but not amazing. The waffles were a bit bland - thank goodness for the syrup but the chicken did have more flavour. The desserts were the southern red velvet cake and candied plantains. The candied plantains dessert was better than the cake (a bit bland) and it also should have come with ice cream according to the summerlicious website description. When asked about it, we were politely told none of the desserts come with ice cream. Okay fair enough, moving on - it tasted good anyway without. Also can't complain much for an $18 summerlicious menu that was decent enough.  When the bill came, we were surprised to see that a 15% gratuity had already been added... for a party of two people. Now we obviously feel that servers of course should be tipped but it's a pet peeve of mine to see it added on automatically when service wasn't even that great and we weren't a big party. The staff seemed nice enough but the two staff we saw literally did their job - they said hello, gave us a table, took our order, gave us each round and then gave us the bill at the end. Nothing spectacular, nothing out of the ordinary. We assumed the automatic gratuity must be because of summerlicious and honestly, we just wanted to get out of there so we didn't question it. How annoying when restaurants do this though.  Anyways, the gist is that it was decent enough for the summerlicious menu price but not sure that we'll be back. There are many other places in TO with similar price points with better food. Wish I could say that I would highly recommend this place to others but our meal here just wasn't that memorable - just \"okay.\" Maybe come here just for drinks as my cousin says the sangria is really good here on a hot day."}
{"text":"I've written a review on the Harlem Restaurant on Queen St W so check that out if you want to compare the two restaurants because this one on Richmond St isn't as good.  I ordered Montreal jazz and the Cajun okra and my friend ordered fish and chips and deep fried pickles. We both got sweet potato fries with our entrees.  So the deep fried pickles was a slightly smaller portion than the one on Queen West. Taste-wise it was the same.  The Montreal jazz was such a disappointment. I tasted the bread more than the actual fillings. I think the bread is the same bread as the Harlem but for the Harlem you can actually taste the fillings!  This was the first time I've ever tried Cajun okra so I can't say if it was made well or not but taste-wise it was mediocre.  Maybe I just like consistency if I know two restaurants are related to each other. I have to say I really enjoyed Harlem on Queen West more ... even the atmosphere seems better."}
{"text":"Honestly SO disappointed in this place. Let me me start with the food: we all liked the fried catfish. It was the best thing any of us ate, though not good enough on its own to come back here for. However, the mussels were fishy and we didn't finish them (we all shared the appetizers) and they didn't give any bread to dip in the broth (which wasn't that flavourful to begin with, especially since it was supposed to be curry...) and then we got the walnut hummus thing which was pretty bland and we also didn't finish it. The mains were fine for all of us -- I had the catfish, but it was underseasoned and again very average. The white sangria was really good, though, for the record.  The biggest disappointment though, was the service. It started out great, with him upselling us on the sangria in a very pleasant way, but then it got bad pretty fast. When I ordered my catfish which came with collard greens, I asked if I could sub for mac and cheese, which was the same price on the menu. He flatout said no, no substitutions, and wasn't very apologetic about it. It was an obvious grab for money as he wanted me to order the $4 mac and cheese on top of my meal, which out of principle I refused to do.  Still, not the end of the world -- it's not the first place I've been that doesn't do substitutions although it is rare.  However, then it got worse. As mentioned, we ordered the appetizers to share, and they didn't bring us any plates to share with. When I asked someone (not our main waiter) he grabbed the plates and plopped all of them down in front of me in a stack without a word and with barely looking at us. I divvied them up between us and took note.  The food took quite a while to arrive, but when we did finish eating, it took us a solid 20 minutes to get someone to bring us our bills. The restaurant was not even that busy and no one was around and when they would be at the bar they would flatly refuse to make eye contact at all. *Finally* he came over and didn't even offer us dessert or anything (which was fine because we would *not* have had dessert here). While we ate, no one checked on us.  The food was average and the service was bad, so neither was enough to redeem the other and I would not return here or recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my trip to Harlem was officially \"meh.\"  I need to preface that I'm from The South, and Harlem's brand of soul food is a Creole/Caribbean mix that isn't the soul food that I'm familiar with. I'm not holding that against them though.  Even though I had called about reserving a table for two, they had no idea I was coming and wanted us to sit at a 4-seater right by the drafty door. My partner even asked if we could sit at a free table further inside the restaurant and that was shot down. \"Nothing I can do about the draft\" the server said. An hour later, that table they didn't want us to sit at was still unoccupied.   Even though there was a band playing upstairs, they left the radio on downstairs, creating a sonic dissonance. There was also a dissonance between the prices on the menu and the paper napkins on our table and the rack of old magazines right beside us.  Before I talk about the food, let's talk about the drinks menu. Their cocktail list is a blast from the past. Retro cocktails are cool. Only in this case the past is 1998. Everything is a  fruity concoction. The cocktail prices are certainly in line with 2014 though.  For a starter we had the candied plantains. It was a good-sized portion and they were our favourite part of the meal. It was fun starting our meal with a sweet dish, and in the future we're going to consider having dessert as an appetizer to shake things up.  For a main I had the jambalaya. It was a hearty portion. The chicken, catfish, and sausage were great. The shrimp, however, still had their tails attached - something I didn't notice until I had eaten a few. Sometimes a dish where everything is all mixed in like a jambalaya ends up losing it's distinctness. In this case, every bite had a slightly different flavour. Speaking of bite, there was not at all. I like my food with a kick, and this jambalaya had none. Usually, that's no problem. I'll just add some salt and pepper and hot sauce. But condiments were nowhere to be found.   We didn't have to wait very long for our food and drinks to arrive, and our server was very friendly when he wasn't discounting our desire to not sit beside the door. We did have to wait a while to order our mains. And wait much too long to pay. In the end, our server left the payment machine with me and wandered off. We'd been waiting so long to leave, I took what I figured was our receipt and left.  I'm still waiting for Toronto to get a good if not great soul food restaurant.  Harlem isn't it."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Summerlicious lunch and I thought the food was delicious. I ordered corn bread, The Nice Lady wrap, and their brownie cookie for dessert. It was my first time trying corn bread and I thought it was pretty good. The Nice Lady wrap was my favourite part of the meal- it was a perfect mix of savouriness from the melted cheese and sweetness from the caramelized plantain. It was an interesting combination of flavours and I really enjoyed it. Dessert was also a highlight- the brownie cookie was soft, sweet, and decadent... It was a sweet tooth's dream.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would probably come here again for The Nice Lady wrap and brownie cookie."}
{"text":"We came here for Summerlicious lunch and were so excited to try the food, but my friend and I was so disappointed.  Only good dish was the chicken and waffles, but even then it was just meh, I have tasted better elsewhere and cheaper.   We had the baby kale salad for appetizer and this was too peppery and gritty I'm not sure why but think it's probably because of the dry Parmesan cheese sprinkled all over the plate, and overall it just didn't taste good.  For dessert I had the bread pudding, I've had bread pudding before and love it, but here, it was way too hard and dense I couldn't put my fork into it, let alone even eat it.    The service was good, the servers there were nice and friendly, but I didn't like the fact that they charged us for mandatory tip! It was just the two of us and we had separate bills! I've been to several restaurants and it's understandable if they charged for groups or 6 or more, but for just 2 people I don't think that's right.  I would still tip, but just didn't like the fact that they sneaked that into the bill."}
{"text":"I've only had chicken waffle twice in my life. First time I went to the stockyard and second I went to Harlem. Needless to say both of the offer amazing chicken waffle dishes with their own unique attributes however I prefer the Harlem restaurant to the stockyards.  Not a far walk from the financial district, I decided to go to this restaurant after a night of binge drinking.. Obviously fried foods is the first to come in mind.  I ordered the chicken waffle which is pretty standard here and in comparison with the stockyards, Harlem does fired chicken better. There was a little more of the greasiness you would sort of expect from fried chicken yet the chicken was moist whereas the stockyards chicken is a little more dried which is moistens by the molasses sauce they use. What I prefer is that Harlem gives you maple syrup as the sause which is something I've grown to as a child and something I find more enjoyable with waffles. The pairing go very well and needless to say I was more than satisfied with my chicken waffle experience.  If you want to try chicken waffle done right, come here. They also had a live Jazz band playing upstairs which I checked out after dinner very neat place."}
{"text":"Of all the summerlicous restaurants, I was most excited to try the menu at this one.  For starters, we both got the cornbread. The cornbread arrived with prepackaged whipped butter. The butter in itself was disappointing because it had \"melted and then re-solidified\" according to the waiter, and was no longer \"whipped\" butter. The cornbread was even first. The first round of cornbread that we had was collectively sour. Even the cook in the kitchen agreed. So finally, the kitchen sent us a second round of cornbread for us.  For the mains, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles and the lady wrap. The lady wrap was boring and uninteresting. Overall, the fried chicken was very nicely done. It was moist with a crispy skin. The waffles themselves were cold and could have been fresher. What made everything worse was that there was a dirty leaf in the salad of the fried chicken. On closer inspection, it either looked like dirt or mold. We gave it to the waiter who brought it to the kitchen, and when the waiter returned, he said that the cook said that it was likely flour. Firstly, flour is generally not brown. Secondly, fresh foods like salads should not be contaminated with inedible foods, like flour. After this incident, the manager made our meals complimentary.  The desserts we ordered was the brownie and the candied plantains. Both were equally uninteresting.  We were both super disappointed in our experience here, particularly because I was very much looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night for the live music and the food.  I was a nice dimly lit place with very tight seating on the second floor.  I was a great environment for couples looking to set the romantic mood.  I had the blacken salmon topped with shrimp and crab etoufee sauce with a side of collards and basmati rice.  The salmon was nicely seasoned and cooked almost well done but just short of well done which could go either way with salmon, it wasn't dry which was my main concern.  The etoufee was far from any etoufee I've ever had not even sure it should be called etoufee perhaps just sauce because it wasn't anything to write home about.  They were out of collards which is one of the reasons I picked the dish and of course I find out when they bring me some other vegetable on my plate instead of letting me know up front.  It was decent, probably wouldn't order it again.  The plantains were AMAZING!!! There were fried in some sort of brown sugar and something sauce which made you want to thank the chief for such a interesting combination of flavor.  I almost order another plate of plantains they were so good.  The music was nice although the singer was sick and didn't sound up to her usual key.  Our server was really nice helping us make our choices from the menu and telling us what he thought about what we considering ordering.  We had a good time and would go back here again."}
{"text":"Beware- the waitress will autograt you on a $10 bill and not tell you - lots of double tipping"}
{"text":"Happened to park right beside Harlem and I walked by it without even noticing it but my girlfriend pointed it out and having heard good things about their chicken and waffles we decided to step in... Ps: it was a good decision.  The chicken and waffle at Harlem is more traditional than places such as Dirty Bird and Stockyard in the sense it is not as crazy flavoured as the other places. However, what separates Harlem is how soft and delicious the waffle was, complimented by the fried chicken!!   I also enjoyed the place itself, relatively small but with a very nice ambience and music. The menus were printed on old school record disc was a nice little feature and the staff was friendly.  On the other side the jerk chicken quesadilla was okay and the menu seems a little limited in what I would order but I would recommend this place for the chicken and waffles (without question)."}
{"text":"My experience here with the staff has been good, the team of servers is really nice and helpful.   I've been here twice but most likely won't be back again, the good is alright but lacks what I would consider staying power. I of course must reveal my bias having grown up in a west Indian household, so maybe my bar is to high but my response to the food is meh.   I will say though that they have a solid chicken and waffles, out of things I've tried there it's my favourite."}
{"text":"Get the southern chicken and waffles $16.95 SO GOOD. The gravy and the syrup was on point! More than enough to fill you up. I also got the Mac and cheese side $5 which was so good .... Oven baked and delicious.   Larissa was our waitress and she was awesome.   Tip: get the white sangria pitcher $30. So worth it.   Oh and make sure you have reservations as its always busy."}
{"text":"On a humid mid-summer night, there was no better place to hideaway than on Harlem's dark and atmospheric alley-like patio. The muraled walls, iron detailed windows, perception-altering red lights and trio of magnificent spinal column-inspired sculpted street-facing bar stools do well to distract from the sea of wonky plastic IKEA chairs and obnoxious game of baseball blaring from the wide screen TV.   Considering both the intense heat and my peckishness on this late evening, I opted for a couple of appetizers to pick at rather than a full entree. The avocado hummous & spiced walnut pate, which arrived as a small yin-yang of saucy blobs, should really have been called a paste. Maybe this is a typo and they have forgotten the crucial 's' because a pâté has a very different consistency by definition. Consistency aside, the flavours of interest just weren't there. I was sorely disappointed in this dish and would caution anyone else from wasting your $7 on it.   In contrast, the seafood fondue was much better. Again, maybe I'm being silly with the semantics, but the point of menus are to connote to the diner an accurate description of the product, no? In any case, this delightfully spicy creamy concoction should have really been called a 'warm seafood dip' rather than a 'fondue' and the following descriptors should be included on the menu: '(baby) shrimp, (imitation) crab meat, and white fish in a (decadently) rich (and spicy) mushroom cream sauce'. I enjoyed spooning this flavourful but soupy mess straight into my mouth, but had really been excited (and then let down) about a dippably thick creamy fondue. Both appetizers were served with Harlem crisps, which are essentially beautifully fried extra thick wonton wrappers.   Since I already know and love their jambalaya, I should have been better braced for the gamble that is trying new dishes. Although the tall ice cold glass of guava juice ended up being the highlight of my meal, the two Harlem first-timers who I had brought with me were very happy with their food (which I'll let them Yelp about themselves). Otherwise, the service from Ivan, our ultra chilled out Mexican server for the night, was great."}
{"text":"Time for another brutally honest review. I must thank Summerlicious for allowing Yelpers to experience the best the city has to offer, and the crappiest.  Here's the thing about Summerlicious: Participating restaurants treat it one of two ways: they either (1) use it as an opportunity to let new customers sample the best their menu has to offer and thus prepare every dish as well as they would in the regular season, while keeping service impeccable or (2) they see it as a way to get more people to buy something for a change instead of having to look at an empty restaurant for another lunch or dinner service. Perhaps it keeps the place afloat for a little while longer and gives them a reason to partially clean their bathrooms.  Unfortunately, my experience at Brooklyn was more to the latter of the above scenarios. I think the best way to describe my experience would be to use the metaphor of being stranded on an island. I walked in and asked for my reservation only to be told that I needed to wait as they set up my table on the alley patio. I did so patiently, but when I was shown to my table by the bus boy it was just a black tablecloth. No cutlery, no glasses, no nothing. Just a black tablecloth of profound, infinite nothingness. Just like being stranded on an island, the following was so: I was thirsty so i waved my hand to receive water from someone, ANYONE, but to no avail. There I sat for 15 minutes until the waitress finally say my distress call and asked if I wanted some water to which I replied \"YES! PLEASE!\" She soon returned with a small cup of water before vanishing again without thinking to, oh I don't know, drop off the menu, some cutlery and perhaps a second glass for my dining companion who arrived a few minutes later.  When she passed again I called for the menu, ordered and waited. Soon the food arrived and she darted off but I felt compelled to ask her to put the brakes on because, guess what, THERE WAS STILL NO CUTLERY or glassware on the table! I was once a server and it's pretty basic procedure to do ONE THING if you forget to do other things: Look at the table. Looking at the table will give you all sorts of useful information about the customer's needs without them saying anything. If there is no cutlery, get some! If glasses of water or other beverage are empty, fill them! Don't have time to be on water duty? Get them a pitcher (we stole one from the table who left next to us).  On a basic service note, Harlem fails quite completely. Yes it was Summerlicious, but it wasn't that packed. And even so, the basics are the basics. Our server was nice enough but clearly not prepared to deal with a restaurant with actual customers in it.  The food, well... sucked. Sorry. The fried okra and pickles were literally just breaded and fried, served in a little plate with generic chipotle mayonnaise. Lame. The chicken and waffles sounded good on the menu, touting a scotch bonnet maple syrup! Of course we ordered that. We got lots of chicken with a tiny bit of some kind of fruit sauce, generic waffles (the same kind you make yourself at a 2.5 star Best Western continental breakfast) and maple syrup. No scotch bonnet spice in the syrup. Just plain old maple syrup. If they ran out of their special syrup (which I suspect is the case) then they should have notified us and not try to sneak Aunt Jemima onto our plates.  Dessert: Mango tart and friend plantain. The mango tart wasn't very tart but was fine and the plantains was just 5 pieces of rougly sliced up plantain on a plate. And when I say roughly sliced, I mean the pieces looked like someone had put on a blindfold, screamed \"SWEEEEEEEEEEEDISH STYLE!!!\" and just hacked at the banana like a viking and threw them on the plate. Not arranged in any artful way, not presented well. Literally just some banana on a plate.... ummmmmmm ok? Points for minimalism or just not giving a F***? That's cool. Guess they've been watching Swedish Meal Time.   Can't complain too much for 15 bucks but with gratuity added automatically the service should be at least to a reasonable standard.  ....(Swedish Style)."}
{"text":"Fried chicken? Check.   Mac & Cheese? Check.   CHICKEN AND WAFFLES???? CHECK!  With these items on the menu, there was no denying that I was going to love eating at Harlem Restaurant.   The menu is to die for, I just LOVE Southern cooking!   To top it all off, they have an amazing brunch with so many heart-attack inducing foods that it's basically like a dream. They also have salads, but  you don't make friends with salad.   So why a three star review? The service at Harlem is questionable at best. They constantly bring out items that are missing part of what was included on the menu (\"oh, we're out of that\") with no substitutions offered, and the timing of meals coming out to the table can be REALLY varied with a big group. I generally find the service a bit too relaxed, they aren't really present enough.   HOWEVER, if you know going in that you won't experience the best service ever, then the food is worth experiencing. I have been back many times (and will continue to visit!) just don't go if you're in a rush!"}
{"text":"Went here for winteicious with a friend and it was amazing! I loved the ambience and smooth mellow vibe. They have two floors and decent service. Though we were on the main bottom floor. Had their cornbread,  fried chicken and waffle with a chocolate tart. The dessert was more like a granola bar than tart but it was nice. The food was great. I also got a pitcher of their rum punch since it was the special of the day. Definitely enjoyed that. Can't wait to go again. Hopefully for an event at night."}
{"text":"I got the fried chicken and waffles plate and it was surprisingly a good combination. Great music. Friendly staff. I would def go back !!"}
{"text":"It was my friends birthday a few weeks ago so we decided to go to harlem restaurant before the summerlicious special was over. Honestly I don't even know where to start so I will break it up in sub sections.   Atmosphere: cozy and intimate. I love the decor choices and the live jazz playing in the background. The dim lighting against the red walls with the funky pictures all tie together nicely. The place needs to be dusted though.   Customer service: was pretty horrible but it was hard to get upset because our waiters were so apologetic and friendly.I asked for a water twice, I asked for syrup 3 times, I had to ask for utensils, I asked for take out containers and I was given one I had to remind them for additional containers and lids, my food took over an hour to come and I had to remind them to clear my table. It was pretty brutal. At the end of the night the manager did apologize and explain they were heavily booked due to summerlicious but he acknowledged that the service being poor is not ok so I give him kudos for that. Hopefully next summer if they do summerlicious they have more staff on duty and are better prepared.  Food: overall everything we had was delicious I had the fried chicken and waffles with a side of collars greens and Mac and cheese. I liked everything except I thought u would get more than half a waffle and I like a thin crispy skin on my fried chicken it was too much like a Popeyes fried chicken. But that's just me! Most people like it thick and crunchy. My friend had the smoked jerk chicken with Mac and cheese. It was a generous portion so he was please. It tastes good too nice rendition of jerk chicken (not traditional). I had the coconut pineapple juice and my friend had the mango. I think they use the rubicon brand which is the one I buy at home so obviously it was delicious. I don't know why I assumed it was fresh juice. My mistake.   Overall my night wasn't bad. I would probably go back and book a table upstairs to be closer to the live band for a different experience."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner.  Appetizer -cornbread: 4 small pieces that were too dried and lacking in taste. -fried catfish?: it was crispy and tasted like calamari. Not too bad.  Entrée -chicken and waffles: gotta admit, these were the best I've ever had. My bf ordered this, and couldn't keep my hands off of it! Definitely recommended.  -Blackened Catfish: the curry sauce on fish was good, but got bored of the dish quickly. The side salad had no flavour.   Dessert -candied plantain: plantain was too dried and hard.. must've made it the day before or something.. Some pieces was stuck together and would not separate. Gross.  It was a disappointment and the only good part was chicken and Waffles. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to our visit to this restaurant - however the waiter was too busy catting on his cell and served us the entire time with an earphone dangling from one ear! It took 20 mins to get a glass of water and felt like forever to get menus on the table. Worst service and the server didn't seems familiar with the menu when asked items! Food was not that great either. Having been to Marcus Samuelsson's Red Rooster and experienced hospitality world-class cuisine and hospitality, there's no contest. Really crap experience at Harlem."}
{"text":"Harlem Restaurant is awesome.  The place itself is very friendly and cozy.  Even with a newborn and then a toddler, the staff is always very accommodating, and one time on a quiet afternoon the waitress even helped carry our baby for a bit to let us eat.    The food here is fantastic!  We are usually here for brunch and two words that mean heaven to me: Chicken Waffle!  Well, it is more than two words but that's all I can say when I'm savoring each bite.  The Southern Friend Chicken and Waffle is serious OMG om nom nom goodness.  The chicken is perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  We have tried other items on the menu, but it is difficult to remember the rest when I have such love for the Chicken Waffle.  In all honesty, there is another memorable item which is their curry chicken.  Not some bland and weak version of curry, this is a flavorful spiceful curry that has you licking your lips.  I highly recommend for something out of the ordinary in Toronto."}
{"text":"My family and I had a nice time at this restaurant a few weeks ago. Very nice ambiance, the music was great, and we enjoyed the food, which was a nice spin on the traditional soul food I'm used to in the US.  And the free chocolate shots (as it was my birthday) was a nice surprise.  There was some miscommunication regarding my reservation (even though I had called twice on the day of the reservation), so there could be an improvement in answering the phone, and overall RSVP handling.  However, I'd definitely return, when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Having ran the streets in Harlem in my younger days this place does not capture the real feel of harlem which cannot be duplicated.  The food was average.  Honestly, I can make better soul food myself.  Seriously, I was taught by the best.  The Southern fried chicken was not southern at all.  It may have been southern carribean (lol).  The mac-n-cheese was bland.  Suprising the collards were okay.  With all that said it is probably the closest you are going to get to any type of southern cuisine in Toronto.  The decor could pass for a nightspot in Harlem but in New York it's all about the people!  The music was good but the people were stand offish and did not show the artist any love.  I felt so sorry for her.  If it wasn't for me clapping it would have been dead silence."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance here. They have a very large and cozy seating space with an aesthetically pleasing art deco/urban decor.The live music was extraordinary and really added to the experience. However, the food, in my opinion, was not all that authentic. I was especially disappointed with the jerk chicken. Their fried chicken was also way too greasy for me. I wouldn't be so critical of the food if their prices were not so ridiculous. I mean, $17 for three pieces of chicken and a side order of mac n cheese? ....c'mon! If I'm ever in the area, I think I might be tempted to drop in for their delicious rum punch and the great live music. Heck, you might even catch me nibbling on some conebread."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. Got the chicken and waffles which I found delicious. Both the chicken and the waffles were super crispy! The chicken paired really well with the sweet sweet Thai sauce and I liked it better than the gravy. The syrup was great too, and I like how all the sauces are served on the side by default. The chicken and waffles are served with a small side salad as well. The overall portion was good..wish there was a little more chicken just because I loved the chicken. However I was very full after finishing the entire plate.  Service was great as our glasses of water was topped very frequently."}
{"text":"I went for dinner and there was a performance upstairs. The place was packed (it was Friday) but there were a few tables downstairs for dining. We ordered the fried chicken and mac & cheese, with mussels. Everything was delicious and my friend's mixed drinks were especially strong poured (always a good thing). I just had the wine which had limited selections.  It's a good neighbourhood spot but nothing impressive for a date (unless you like a rugged underground feel)"}
{"text":"After I enjoyed my experience at their Queen St W location, I decided to venture here because it's closer to where my inner circle travels. However, this location is a lot smaller and more cramped. It wasn't too busy when we came but there wasn't very much staff which was our food took a while to come out.  I brought my friends here for the chicken and waffles. The waffle is nice, light and fluffy. The fried chicken that sits atop is crunchy and delicious. Jerk chicken quesadillas were phenomenal here and definitely my top favourite.  We tried the Harlem's chef plate which came with a little bit of a lot of different type of food. It's great value especially if you're sharing amongst a group of friends. While I'm not a big fan of fish, I still loved the catfish lafayette. If you want something to snack on, try harlem crisps which come with the tasty sauces. The mac 'n cheese is also worth trying."}
{"text":"If you want soul food, especially fried chicken, definitely come!  There's also a cool vibe and the staff is amazingly attentive and sweet."}
{"text":"There's a new contender for best fish 'n chips in town, and it's Harlem's lunch menu. Not sure if it's a regular thing but yesterday's special of Fish 'n Chips + sweet potato medallions, coleslaw and tangy aioli was dynamite. Definitely the best fish 'n chips I've had in the city - the universal remote-sized filet was juicy, flaky and perfectly battered. I am pretty sure it may have been catfish 'n chips because that kind of drool only pools at the corners of my mouth when I'm eating my namesake."}
{"text":"I took my mom here last year for their Mother's Day buffet. Everything from the service to the food was perfect, so I decided to take her again this year. Wow. I can't believe how the quality changed. First, the buffet was set up in the middle of the restaurant so it was hard to get food when everyone else was. Second, there was HAIR in the jambalaya; everyone in the restaurant saw it. Third, the food was COLD, COLD, COLD. We wanted to ask to use the microwave. The fried chicken was drenched in the honey chili sauce, but it was good and so was the jambalaya. The mac & cheese was tasteless. They didn't have fruits at all this time. AND they automatically added a 15% gratuity (there was 4 of us); pretty presumptuous given the service and quality they provided.   Overall, quite a disappointment and I feel bad I took my mother to such a horrible place. I wish I could ask for my money back."}
{"text":"Such a great find. Not overly busy. Friendly staff and damn good fried chicken. Great weekend brunch spot"}
{"text":"Went to this lovely resto last night with a friend to check out their live band!! The resto was rather cozy (i.e. small), the food looked delish, the staff was friendly and the music was pretty amazing =) It was an enjoyable experience and would definitely come back for more....   For those of you looking for a business venue that can hold 40-50 people, this would be a good pick!! I, for one, am considering it for our next team social ;) Hey, I bet you can turn this into a karaoke with live music if you are up for it!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy this place, kinda expensive for what you get. I had the fried chicken with waffles and the plate was tiny, which does not match what you expected of comfort food. Also the fried chicken was very blend, I expected some crazy seasoning and felt It was mediocre."}
{"text":"Since having my tastebuds blown away by the White Brick kitchen's Chicken and Waffles last year, I have been searching for a comparable plate.  I was so excited to try the Harlem version.   Obviously I ordered the fried chicken and waffles...   Meh... It was okay.  I was not overly impressed.  I was disappointed with how filling the dish was.  It looked like a medium size portion, but when I was done, I could of literally had another plate.   Others in my group agreed that the portion sizes could use a little beefing up.    The bartender did make us some dill pickle martinis which were absolutely fantastic... but I came for chicken and waffles.   Staff was friendly... we were a large group, so tip was added onto the bills automatically.  I think they forgot to mention that (: P).   I will continue my search for the perfect chicken and waffles.  I would come back to this location, but likely sample something different."}
