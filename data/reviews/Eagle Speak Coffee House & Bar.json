{"text":"Oh my gosh I love this place!  Totally laid back.  Sarrah, The owner has never met an enemy and if you want to talk, she has the most interesting stories to tell!  Of course she is busy slinging coffee much of the time.  This is truly what a coffee shop should be!  Come to the \"Friends\" coffee shop in Charlotte.  You will be back that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Hooray! An funky little coffee and desert joint in my neighborhood with late hours. The staff is kind and the concept is upbeat. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte to have a cold beer and listen to local tunes! Awesome owner - friendly environment"}
{"text":"So I used Yelp to help me find a nice coffee spot so I didn't have to run to Starbucks on my lunch. I checked the hours and the location was to open at 2pm. I arrive there at 205p the signs were off and all the light. I waited until 215 then I had to go back to work. The sign stated m-f open at 2pm. Pretty disappointed that I wasted a entire lunch and had to go back empty handed."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop, the best coconut cake I've ever eaten! And of course it was Home made, no out of the box stuff here. Anita was Very nice! Great espresso drinks and live music on the weekends. Like Arnold said... I'll be back."}
{"text":"great new place, Scaleybark and S. Blvd, right across from light rail station.  Excellent chicken salad sandwich"}
{"text":"The bartender lost my charge card during a simple transaction, while I was standing there. The charge went through so I have confirmation that she had the card.   Immediately I told her she had not given it back to me.  She looked for it while I was there.    I had to cancel the card and she was glib about it, saying I should cancel the card.  The music was great but use cash only.  This was very frustrating and time consuming."}
{"text":"A little bit of Plaza Midwood and Noda rolled into a coffee house near Southend! If you need your caffeine fix in the Sedgefield/Scaleybark area you may want to check out this little gem. They feature popular lattes and cappuccinos and they have almond milk! Sandwiches, soups and salads are tasty especially the turkey with a kale & spinach spread. There is a party room in the back and a small stage in the front for performances and they also serve Tropicalsno shaved ice! Try the Georgia Peach you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very eclectic atmosphere. I wasn't a fan of the coffee but I would definitely come back for the good vibes. I liked all the retail/artwork for sale, too. I bought a pair of hair clips while I was there!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop with excellent service. The owner is receptive to the needs of her customers and goes out of her way to provide anything needed within reason. It's a clean space with a fair amount of seats for small groups. The coffee is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is in non-descript strip mall on South boulevard. But head inside and you'll find a place full of ambience and vibe. This place is an amazing eclectic coffee shop and bar. Live music most nights seems to be a mix of talented local artist. Sarrah the owner is friendly and makes you feel very welcome. But the very best part.... They have honest to goodness authentic shave ice!"}
