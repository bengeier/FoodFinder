{"text":"This place was really good, we had a Groupon and it got a lot of food! The service was great, my girlfriend had to send the mahi mahi back the first time and they fired up a new one quickly and it was awesome, I ordered the 10 oz steak and it was almost perfect, the garlic mashed were kind of weak but the veggies made up for it, it was kind of expensive but the whole adventure was really nice, it was a great place for a quiet private occasion, the music wasn't too loud and we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation"}
{"text":"Where to start- WOW service. I went here for a bachelorette dinner and from start to finish the service here was exceptional. Food was great- service was better. One guest in our party had steak that was not cooked to her taste, the staff was quick to insist on improving even when our guest did not say anything. To take things further, the staff brought in complimentary deserts- 3 different kinds AND champagne for all. It was very obvious that the satisfaction of their guests were the number one priority amongst each server. We will definitely be back.. Wow. Thank you for an unforgettable service experience."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for Wildfire going in... it looks stunning in and out, with amazing design and music to create a perfect fine-dining ambiance.  The staff were extremely friendly right up until the end.  Unfortunately, even the niceness of the staff was not enough to salvage what was an extremely disappointing 4th wedding anniversary dinner.  First off, they advertise free parking and an exclusive lot on the website.  I drove around the block twice before parking on a side street a block away.  Couldnt find the spots, but anyway...  The complimentary bread was great, and the homemade chutney was also good.  That's where the pleasantness ended.  The grilled fish my wife ordered was bland, to the point of us suspecting it hadnt received any salt.  I ordered the ribs with mashed potatoes instead of fries (I hate fries).  The waiter seemed to understand the simplicity of the order, and even confirmed the substitution once our drinks came out.  Of course, it was all fries when it arrived.  He said not to worry, my mashed would be out and i'd get both (again, i hate fries).  After 25 minutes and the completion of our meal, I was still waiting for a side I could eat.  So basically I paid almost $40 for a lonely rack of ribs on a plate.  The waiter never checked to see if they came out, and out take-out bin (promised to contain the missing spuds) looked like it had someone else's plate's potatoes wiped into it.  They were set and flat on one side, with chunks missing.  Gross, never touched it.  They served us some ice wine to try and make up, but my wife hates blush (also never asked...)  The only good food was the free food.  So, in my opinion go there for drinks only... (at least they offer Innis and Gunn).... but I woudlnt rely on them for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Date of patronage - 09.15.2010  Service was subpar. There was an abundance of waitstaff at the location but I dont think any of them actually worked there. There was a lot of running around but no actual work being completed. Our waitress wasn't very friendly, in fact at times she seemed condesending.  The bread took 45 minutes to arrive, the food nearly an hour.   My order: 12oz NY Steak w/mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables ($42), a side of Sweet Potatoe Fries ($6) and a Creme Brulee ($12) for dessert and 2 glasses of Coca-Cola ($6)  Overall, the food was \"ok\". Steak was tasty but the sides were not. Sweet potato fries were soggy and limp.   + tax and gratuite, this meal cost ~ $90 all said and done. The Keg is less expensive - and better.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Had a good time here with a bunch of my friends! The space is nice for a bigger group of people and service was pleasant. I order a medium-rare steak which turned out to be well-done when it came to my table, but they offer me another one immediately also took it off my bill! I really appreciated that, since I have been to restaurants that didn't even care nor apologize for their mistake. Btw, the steak was juicy and full of flavor. Over all, it's my top one steak house uptown!"}
{"text":"I went to Wildfire because of a Groupon, and it was a great find!  It was dinner for two, we both ordered the New York Strip Loin, rare, and they were both amazing. I ordered the Caesar salad which was a let down, but the hostess took it away and \"replaced\" it with a glass of bubbles to complement the crème brûlée I ordered for dessert. Delicious!   Service from our hostess, server, and general manager was great. Lots of personality, great energy for a small place. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I used a groupon I received for my birthday for dinner recently and left unimpressed.   We were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us down right away. The first odd thing we noticed was that there was an independent vendor by the entrance selling jewelry and makeup laid out on some tables. This thoroughly confused me because I have never seen something like this at a restaurant before, and it really cheapened the overall vibe of Wildfire.   They have a set menu for those using a groupon, and we ordered the following:  - Calamari Fritti: The coating on the calamari was delicious and the accompanying aiolis were tasty as well.  - Beef Carpaccio: Delicious! This was served with a generous helping of arugula.  - 10 oz New York Striploin: Asked for medium rare, received medium. The steak was very bland and dry, making it difficult to swallow.  - Wildfire Back Ribs: Nothing special about this dish - the flavour was okay but that's it.   - Polenta Fries: This was an extra side we ordered. The fries came in huge pieces, making it rather difficult to eat. - Chocolate Torte: I have had better chocolate flourless cake.. that's all.  - Creme Brulee: Good but nothing to rave about.   Our meal also came with chef's selection of hors d'oeuvres, which were really really bad. They gave us cocktail shrimp (could still taste the frozenness), some sort of a fishy tasting paste on a slice of cucumber (the paste tasted weird and did not compliment the cucumber), and a bite-sized pastry with some sort of an olive-based dip.   Portions were generous, I'll give them that. I was already 3/4 full on the starters alone. The meal started off fairly promising because the starters were delicious, but everything went downhill from there.   Food aside, service was attentive... maybe overly attentive. I sound picky by this point but the busboys constantly came to our table to check if they could clear anything. I counted 12 times throughout our dinner when they came to check up on us, only to turn around right away when they notice nothing needed to be cleared. This would have been less awkward if we didn't sit in a dead end corner... the constant visits/check-ins were really disruptive.   The overall experience was disappointing. Not sure if our experience reflects that of the chain or this location, but I would be wary of returning to any Wildfires in the future."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a job promotion and wouldn't ever return or recommend it.  My wife and I ordered the surf and turf, while we were waiting for it to arrive we noticed another table, in mid meal, was asked to move so they could get wine out of a cabinet, it ended up taking them almost two minutes as the couple stood there awkwardly while the server rummaged through the cabinet, who does that to someone? I'm sure they enjoyed their cold steaks after that.  When our food finally arrives I cut into my steak and it's well done, I had ordered medium rare, I show it to the server, an older lady, who then proceeds to tell me that I'm wrong, and it's not overdone at all! This wasn't the first time eating steak and I definitely know what well done versus medium rare is. I ask her to take it and show it to the kitchen, she she leaves with my well done little hockey puck.  I cut into the lobster and lone behold, it's raw! By this time our surly server has returned with the well done steak and the little manager with a french accent who is a real piece of work. I show her the lobster and the manager proceeds to tell me \"well we get them frozen and it must have thawed and been refrozen and not cooked enough\" upon hearing that comment I start mentally planning my drive to the nearest hospital! They take the lobster away and I then ask about the steak, he tells me this \"we cook them over wood so the chefs can't control the temperature\" I then ask why did you ask me how I wanted it done in that case? UNBELIEVABLE!  They only took the lobster off my bill as well, didn't even buy me a flippin glass of wine or a beer for terribly over and under cooked food.   I then emailed the owner who of course says all the right things, and then says he wants my business and wants to send me a gift card, I send him my address and it's been two years now and I'm still waiting for that gift card!  Not a place I would recommend to my enemies. If you want better steak and better service head to Harbour 50, Barberians, Josephs, The Keg  etc. the options are endless in Toronto, heck McDonalds is better than this place and the staff aren't complete A-holes when giving me a hashbrown!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I will start off with the goods.  We were a party of 10 on a Sunday evening for summerlicious. Service was courteous and helpful. No complaints about the staff and service. That's all I could think of.  For the bads, serving of food was slow, but a kitchen backup happens to all restaurants.  Now for $45, I expect fantastic and well cooked meals. My wife and I started off with the Caesar salad. Great taste, but for some reason my stomach started hurting after that plate was done. It's typical that my feeble stomach instantaneously  tells me to go to the loo if I have eaten something bad. Can't blame the salad right? Three hours later my wife rushes to the bathroom with the same symptoms.... Main dishes come out, I ordered a NY strip medium rare with mashed side.  The meat was flavoured well however was cooked at a medium. I enjoy cooking meat on occasion, and always do the firmness test, I knew this cut was medium just by the touch. OK, 10 dishes to make most likely my beef was cooking under the heat lamp while waiting for the other dishes.  One friend also received a medium steak, when he asked for medium rare. There is no excuse for not knowing how to prioritize!  For dessert I got the cheesecake, it was good but it appeared store bought.    This was my second time going. The first time was a few years ago and it wasn't good then. We had no choice for this dinner vowing to spend our next steak night at the keg.  IMHO, this meal shouldnt be priced as high as the likes of north 44 or canoe for example. The quality and care for food is lacking, stop using frozen lobsters and store bought desserts!  There is no interest or creativity in every dish to make me want to come back for more."}
{"text":"Horrible service  V. Mediocre menu Lack of spice & flair, absolutely nothing 'wild' Extremely overpriced  Altogether lousy option for uptown dining, steer clear"}
{"text":"Went here during winterlicious. Ordered the escargot, steak, and creme brulé as part of the 45 dinner. Added ribs and ordered wine from their winterlicious menu as well. Escargot was really tasty. My friend ordered the calamari and it was definitely very fresh. I ordered the steak medium rare and it was almost perfect. The pepper is bit charred so don't put too much. Steak and ribs weren't too special overall, not the highlight of my meal. The creme brulé was really smooth and tasty, highly recommended. Their cheesecake is good as well.  The service was great, friendly server who definitely deserved the 18% gratuity. Ended up spending 85 per head. Pricey but the stomach was satisfied til the next day. Definitely a place to try out! Their wine is cheap and tasty. Definitely worth getting a few bottles to try.  Order took longer to come than expected, so might want to come here when you're not tight on time!"}
{"text":"Great little place tucked inside an apartment hotel.  The menu was extensive for the size - the steaks were unbelievably seasoned and delicious.  The cheesy garlic bread was smothered in butter and we wanted more!  Highly recommend - we will eat here every time we come to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend last night to make use of a groupon.  Ambiance was casual to fine dining- nice decor and dim light setting. We each enjoyed a four course meal. Hors d'oeuvre, appetizer, entree, dessert and also came with wine.  Our mains were wildfire backribs and shrimp on a bamboo skewer(fries and vegetables on side) and a 10 oz New York striploin (mashed potato and vegetables on side). Why not try some meat at a steakhouse right? Both very great, seasoned well and filling (did not skimp out). Check out my pictures for a description of the other dishes. For the wine, I don't drink alcohol, so the server made me a custom drink and it fit the meal quite nicely.  Overall, it was a great experience. Great value with the groupon."}
{"text":"Top-notch service, well-seasoned and prepared food, good variety of drinks. A great option for a special night."}
{"text":"After much hype for this restaurant based on my bro's visit on a dinner service, we decided to come on the last day of Winterlicious for lunch... The host was friendly and open the door for us.   The place seems a bit dark, kind of made me feel blinded and sleepy...Our waiter comes and *whiff* BIG B.O. Alert!!! Our waiter was quite pushy on the wine, but I decided to order a soda. I did inquire what size were the shrimp martini, becuz I was deciding either that or the chilled lobster! Server response...I don't know and left it at that...  I ordered the shrimp martini, my bro ordered the chilled lobster, my gf ordered the lobster bisque...Shrimp size is 26/30 and was alright. Chilled lobster based on freshness is 6.5/10... Lobster bisque did not have any lobster meat in it, but it was alright... A bit salty!  Mains: Salmon, Chicken, Angus Beef Burger (Asked for Medium cooked) - Salmon was undercooked and tasted bland. - Chicken is standard...Nothing special about it. - Burger ended up well done, and tasted standard...My sweet potato fries were soggy...  Desserts: Cheesecake, Pecan Tart, Chocolate Dome cake. They were all alright...  Overall giving 2 stars is kind of nice...It may be one..Our server was not particularly good. They have a lobster promo coming soon, so I don't know if it would be a hit..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was here for winterlicious. Everything was great, warm and tasty. Service was excellent and I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"We visited Wildfire after a friend recommended it to us. It was terrific. Just off Yonge, it is a trendy spot that offers rustic fine dining. They have a simple menu but strive for perfection in everything. The best creme brulée in Toronto! Extensive wine list. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon deal and it was honestly one of the best meals I've had.  The server we had was very passionate about some of the menu items and made some excellent recommendations.  I had the hor d'oeuves which were really good.  The calamari was okay, as I tasted cilantro in the dressing (which I didn't really like).  The escargot that my girlfriend had was flavourful.  I definitely recommend getting the decadent chocolate torte and the creme brulee, both of which were \"house-made\" and very savoury.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I came here with a groupon it was $175 for 4 ppl and a four course dinner including a glass of wine each. I have to say I was shocked with the food and the service. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable and the food usually with a groupon I notice it's smaller portions this was anything but. We all had the 10oz steak which was delicious, no fat cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back here again without a groupon and I would say it's up there with quality as all the other steakhouses."}
{"text":"I came here for the summerlicious promotion, the food was excellent and they were not cheap on their portions. DEFINITLY reccomend this place."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Perfect food. Awesome service. Just cant say enough. Best rib eye I've had in years. Other than parking you'll enjoy every second of being there. Definitely will return there soon."}
{"text":"At last a quiet new restro-bar, convenient but off the beaten track in Downtown Toronto. Good Food & Service and a place where one can hear one's dining partners conversation."}
{"text":"Prices are pretty steep, but if you get a group on, it's a good deal.The service is OK  That being said,  the food is excellent, .Our family had 10 oz New York steaks and the chicken...for desert the chocolate cheesecake is outstanding..."}
{"text":"Went here for me and my gf anniversary.  Service was excellent.  Waitress pointed out dishes we should avoid which is a nice touch.  Steak and decor was excellent.  Complimentary champagne at the end of the supper capped off an excellent meal and desert.  Asked for a veggie substitute and was given complimentary and yummy mushrooms. Ask for the bbq sauce, you won't be disappointed.  Would be 5/5 if not for the undercooked vegetables and unseasoned mashed potatoes.  Other than that a great time and will come back again."}
{"text":"I dono guys, I really liked this place! Had great service and food both times I went, once for summerlicious, and once for a regular priced meal. Both times, the food was perfect and the staff was attentive. Not cheap, but we felt it was on par for what we paid for our meal. I'm sure everybody's expectations are different, and maybe I was lucky both times I came here, but come on - I think they deserve more than 1 star???"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night with a groupon for a 4 course meal.  Everything was delicious.  Started with the chefs h'ordevoirs which were deep fried polenta, bruschetta, shrimp, and beef skewers.  Then app of shrimp cocktail main course a 10 ounce steak with grilled veggies followed by creme brûlée for dessert.  We all really enjoyed our food and probably would come back."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious today at 7pm. Gave us a table but we didn't like it so we asked to switch.  The second table was still by the exit.  Anyway,  nobody came to greet us for at least 10 minutes until we asked for service.  I had the 45 summerlicious meal.  Started with the calamari - just mediocre.  Had the new York strip loin for the main - steak was bland and couldn't taste the garlic in the garlic mash potatoes.  For dessert it was the choicolate torte.  Just tasted like a warmed up chocolate bar.  Medicocre service for mediocre food.  Had to ask for the bill twice before getting it.  Go to the Keg for a better steak and Moxie's for better service."}
{"text":"Damned this place, 10oz steak overcooked it causes constipation for 8 days. Wish city health would drop by. I won't be back. (18/10/17)"}
{"text":"The pictures refer to Wildfire on Yonge street and not to this one."}
{"text":"(Note: previous review was inadvertently placed erroneously for the Wildfire Steakhouse/Wine Bar downtown.)  I have not been a regular visitor of Wildfire for some time. My latest visit was in late September 2015 for a casual sponsored dinner function in spite of timing of this post. This review therefore may be positively biased. Overall I'd give it 3.5/5.  Preamble: location is decent but parking was atrocious (you wouldn't want to be lured into a law firm's innocent but exclusive parking lot would you?)  Ambience is a casual yet upscale one, sophisticated yet mundane.  Service is also more than attentive and sincere.  Back on topic though: I had the Romaine Salad - hearts of romaine tossed in a red wine vinaigrette, with peppers, olives, and feta cheese. For main course I had the New York Striploin - with garlic mashed Yukon gold potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  I dissented from what others recommended on the group menu - the Churrasco Mixed Grille - back ribs and piri piri chicken, garlic mashed Yukon gold potatoes, seasonal vegetables (not pictured).  And for dessert I had decadent chocolate torte - house made flourless Belgian chocolate torte - desserts which I took home as usual.  Shared appetizer was satisfying. Based on other reviews understood this was a mass production one but I think  Wildfire pulled it off decently. I thought the cucumber with smoked salmon mousse was also well executed contrary to what others thought.  Salads are just salads and can't make too much of it. It's still decently fresh, not sure why it was so moist and soggy (?frozen ?washed too much) but it was still presented with sort of a bibimbap latitude that allows individual autonomy (olives concentrated bottom right, for example, and which I like btw).    But...here's my beef ahem - it was disappointing for a self-styled steakhouse. Though a notch higher than my latest travails with David Duncan House a few blocks nearby it just was just not ... inspiring. The steak certainly wasn't criminal - but certainly not memorable either, and I am glad I was not one footing the bill. (Maybe it was another mass production) It does not make much sense when a random piece of beef from a fast-food court stir fry could be just as good - if not even better - when I already preferred it to be medium rare or even medium in the first place!  Not being a dessert person, I did take the chocolate torte home and family loved it. That was a plus.  Overall competent. You won't be disappointed of, for lack of a better term, an \"upper middle class\" excursion. Unless you're gaming for the main course."}
{"text":"This is only about the service or more specific the manager as I had not dinner but just a drink at the bar. Also I have never bothered to sign up to yelp over the last 5 years to write a review but he did it for me.   Manager treats his employees inappropriately, and while he does not discriminate in general it is especially awkward toward his female colleagues.  He was mostly sitting at the bar having drinks with his buddy and asking the bartender to get his phone so he can go for a smoke. Also gave very generous drinks to people he knew so would fire him right away just for this.  This restaurant may have great food but if you hire such a manager you do not deserve to be in business."}
{"text":"Surprised my boyfriend with lunch at Wildfire after getting a couples' massage on the 4th floor of the hotel. I informed the waitress that it was my boyfriend's birthday. The food was a little expensive, but the proportions were fairly big. The caesar salad was literally a whole lettuce vegetable grilled and topped with cheese, bacon, and croutons. It was interesting and tasty, but difficult to cut and eat. We ordered a salmon soup, crusted basa, and black angus beef burger as well, and two drinks. The food was nice, but we couldn't finish it all. The drinks were even better. They also served bread with balsamic vinegar on the side. We tried to get the fixe prix deal (2 meals at 20 something dollars each, which would have came out to $40 for 2 people) but they ended up charging us each dish separately plus they charged us $3 for water. The total came out to $85 with tips. At the end of our lunch, they surprised us with champagne on the house, which was really nice. Wildfire was conveniently located and it fit with our itinerary for the day, that's why I chose the place, but I doubt I will return again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night upon getting out of the airport and getting back to central Toronto.  I was enticed by the idea of good ribs, so that's what we came here to get!  They didn't disappoint, either...very tasty, meaty, fell right off the bone, perfect amount of (very tasty) sauce.  The wine list was pretty extensive, but we only had by the glass.  Being a native Torontonian and a fan of wine tasting in Niagara, I was disappointed that the only Ontario red wine by the glass was Jackson-Triggs.  Boo.  In short, the food was tasty, the service was good, the prices seemed high.  I'd go again if I wasn't paying."}
{"text":"I visited during Summerlicious and they had a great pre-fix menu... I mean scargots, shrimp, lobster, Rib steak, etc.  When we got there they made us wait in the bar, we were there for 5 minutes and the bar tender never came to take our order, she gave us a menu and looked at us while drying some dishes... never took our order, I really wanted to try a Martini with Hyptonic... didn't have the chance and by the time I got to my table I changed my mind.  Service was great, our server made recommendations, the sommelier and the manager visited our table as well, I have to say they are fast and make suggestions. I definitely recommend the shrimp martini and the carrot cake (even when it tastes like clove) the cream cheese frosting works well with it. My lobster was a bit bland, something regular and totally expected. Nothing new or great to comment. Mashed potatoes with wasabi weren't my style but my husband liked them, they are not spicy, but a little bitter for my taste. He ordered rib steak with truffle butter and it was outstanding!!! great taste, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Amazing!  My dessert plate was dirty and even when I don't tolerate this things, they were very nice and speedy about it and brought a new one. However, I do think they have an area of opportunity with their dishes, you can see stains on them from the dishwasher or something...  Over all good, with a few things that deserve someone's attention."}
{"text":"The steakhouse in the lobby of our hotel, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews.  The staff were accommodating and delightful.  Our orders were prepared exactly as requested.  We ordered the bacon-wrapped filet and the porterhouse and they were probably two of the best steaks we've eaten in a while, and we frequent steakhouses regularly.  Perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of char adding to the exquisite buttery warm meat.  The French onion soup was also a highlight.  Nothing bad to say about our experience whatsoever, and we'll make it a stop in future visits to town."}
{"text":"Been here, food is great; service waiting was a little long but company kept time occupied, great place to just eat out. Price was decent a little over expected; portion sizes were below normal but the setting was great an looks nice."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ THIS IF IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT. I just made a yelp account only to write a review for Wildfire because people should be warned about this place. I wish i could have given them 0 stars. Their food is terrible and I had to share my experience.  I've been there a few times before throughout the years, and the experience has never been good. I swore I'd never go back.  Till someone gave me a gift certificate for this place. So we went there tonight just so the gift certificate wouldn't go to waste. I ordered the Caesar salad to start which had a weird Mexican type corn salad on the side, just bad. Then I ordered the surf and Turf with a fillet mignon and lobster tail. The lobster was so over cooked that it was like chewing rubber or sidewalk. Just awful. Every one knows how delicate lobster meat is and how rubbery and chewy it can get if you over cook it. this was so tough to chew I couldn't believe I was eating lobster. I ordered a medium rare cook on the fillet and it was undercooked, yet the meat was dry, it didn't have any juices when you cut into it, while being undercooked. I asked them to please put it back on the grill to a medium and what they brought me back was more than well done. The steak looked like a carcass, it was dry and way over cooked and very very charred black on the outside. Not seared, charred. Definitely not a medium. The mashed potatoes were bland. My friend ordered the lamb and said it was \"meh\" at best. All their meats lack serious seasoning. The only good part of the meal was the butter for the lobster and the wine.  I'm in shock that this place is still in business, since every time I've been there the food has sucked. Go to the Keg if you want a decent steak, their food is 10 times better, even though they are a chain. Or if you want something higher quality go to Harbour 60 (the most incredible lobster) or the Octagon (great steaks), they are both amazing. Please save your money and your frustration and do not go to Wildfire. Please. It's awful. Go to McDonalds instead, at least you won't feel bad for spending a lot on crap food there."}
{"text":"Wildfire's was the best service I have ever had hands down (and great food!).   My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary because we found a promotion online. The staff was extremely polite and sat us down right away. The summerlicious deal we got came with a small course before the apps.  It was 2 small beef skewers, shrimp, polenta and bruschetta. When the waitor found out I was gluten intolerant he told me he'd be back in a bit with something extra from the kitchen. I told him I was totally fine with what he brought out but he insisted. A few minutes later the GM came and introduced himself. He apologized for the gluten thing because I did indicate it when making the reservation. They came out with these meatball bacon bit mashed potato concoction which was quite tasty.  The grilled calamari app that I ordered was amazing and our entrees were great too! Before dessert our waiter said that he noticed it was our anniversary and brought us two glasses of prosecco on the house.  Our desert had happy anniversary written on it and was really cute. They went above and beyond for us and for that I can't recommend it enough! It's a pretty restaurant but more importantly they have great lychee martinis ;)"}
{"text":"We came using a Groupon (that I bought this evening as I didn't want to cook!) and I'm more than impressed by this place.    The ambiance was definitely 5/5, the service was definitely 5/5.  Staff were attentive, our food came out exactly when it should have so the meal had a very appropriate pace.  Basically, we would have a slight lull in conversation and our next course would arrive!    The food is the only place where I had any concerns (and these are VERY minimal).  The hors d'oeuvres were excellent, I actually think that might have been the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had.  The shrimp were the perfect level of plumpness and almost crispiness (spectacular!).  The appetizers were wonderful (we had the calamari and the escargots), the bread that accompanied was good (my partner would have preferred butter over hummus, but I like hummus, so I'm not complaining).  We both had the steak, and both asked for medium (we are both comfortable with a range from medium rare to medium well).  The steaks were closer to medium rare than medium, though it was arguable.  Regardless, we both FULLY enjoyed them and did not send them back, they were extremely tender and very flavourful (sending them back likely would have ruined that, I'm sure).  The desserts (creme brulee and caramel brownie cheesecake) were rich and decadent and perfectly sized servings (the cheesecake might have been the richest I've ever had!).    So overall, if I could give it 4.5 or even 4 and 3/4, I would.  As it stands 4/5 is our review and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time at Wildfire and it won't be my last. The beef skewers and the tapenade/bruschetta crostini are some of the best kept secrets (until now) that this place has to offer. They are only available off the \"special bar menu\" so be sure to ask for it when you get there. Another good one for sharing is the mushroom ragu with crostini.  Large selection of wines, my favourite is the Bodega Sottano Malbec -- a considerably more affordable (but no less delicious) wine than its cousin (the Judas).  The good thing about this place is that it's a little bit hidden from the street so you can take your pick of tables and service is quick. Washrooms are a long way away, up the stairs and down the hall in the hotel that is also housed in the same building. Atmosphere is upscale but certainly works for casual fine dining. This is a first date kind of place.  I was lucky enough that my colleague treated me to lunch today but I noticed last time a few mistakes on the bill so keep your eyes peeled just in case. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews but I was complied to do so in this case. I was quite disappointed.   In the beginning me and my partner was greeted and we were seated. It seem to have started great. We were given complimentary appetizer. Two pieces of shrimp, two bruschetta, and two cucumber slice with a salmon mousse on top. Quite tasty.  As we were eating, I didn't really think of much in the beginning. But I saw another couple(white) who had the same apps but had four pieces of shrimp. I was a little disturb. We were two asian couple and we were in our 30s. The inconsistency was disturbing.  Next our actually appetizer came in. I had the grilled calamari with a slight charred favour topped with greens, and my partner had PEI mussels in a white cream sauce. Both were fine. No issues  Then our mains came in. My partner had ribs and a skewer of shrimp. Both were fine but nothing special. The ribs was drenched in BBQ sauce but it was tender. The shrimp was grilled.  My main was a double leg. I didn't pick the steak because I had steak from another restaurant not too long ago so I wanted something different. That was when problems started happening. One leg was cooked fine but the other leg was oozing out blood. It was unacceptable. So I ask them to take it back. So they re-fired and cook it again. I received the same chicken back but it was still oozing out blood. At the moment, I didn't want to get it again. I was upset, and uncook chicken was something I didn't want to mess with. So at that moment I told them don't worry about it. I don't want anything else. I did not even get an apology from management or even took back my plate and did the meal again at the first chance they got. I was not looking for a free meal or anything. I just wanted something done right and shouldn't be worried from getting sick from eating chicken. Once again, I gave them a chance to do it right but they blew it.  Oddly my partner over heard another table had improper cooked steak. I was wondering what's going on??? Anyhow  Next dessert, we both got crème brûlée. That's the most redeeming part of the meal. Hard sugar top, smooth custard and not a bit grainy. If you want to have your meal here that probably the only thing I'll order.  Once we finished and received my bill. I think I given them a reasonable 15% tip considering the type of treatment we received, but management gave me the cold shoulder when I completed the transaction. I didn't want to make a scene or argue. We just left quietly and never we return again.  Final thoughts, if you must go, I recommend the crème brûlée (that was the one star). I would have given them nothing if I had the choice. Either then that there are much better places to go. The Keg or Ruth Chris, they offer much better for the money and better service. The service was mediocre at best. If you are in the service industry, service should be number 1 no excuses. Management was just awful."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Wildfire Grille in November 2011. The waiter was attentive and respectful. The warm bread and hummus were excellent, as was the appetizer of grilled calamari. the striploin and filet mignon were excellent, perfectly prepared. the only negative aspect was the loud atmosphere due to a lack of music: i could hear the entire conversations from the table behind me and the one beside me. by the end of dinner, I was anxious to leave the noisy room."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant the first time with a Groupon for 2 when a friend was visiting from New Brunswick, and it was delicious!! I had the steak, cooked perfectly, and my friend had the chicken which was great as well.   It was so good that when my parents and friends came for a visit from New Brunswick and said they wanted to go out for steak, this was the first place that came to mind. Since there will be 5 this time, we can't all use a Groupon but when I called and talked to the assistant manager he was very helpful with suggestions and was able to fit us in with a table and I can't wait to take everyone there. I am sure it will be delicious again.   I have actually planned on bringing another friend from NB here when she comes to visit in May as well.   The restaurant is in a good location from my condo, a little difficult to find the first time, but once you see it and get in the door it is a great atmosphere. Servers and all the staff were really nice and friendly.   I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone local or visiting."}
{"text":"I went to this place for summerilicous lunch and it was the best summerlicious I've ever been to! We didn't need to wait and even when one person in my group was  1/2 an hour late, the waitress did not hurry us.  The selection was wonderful - 5 choices for appetizers, 8 choices for entrees, 3 choices for dessert. What more can you ask for?   I had a table of 8 so we tried quite a number of dishes:  Escargots - very buttery and tasty Grilled Calamari - good portion and lightly seasoned  Grilled Soy-Ginger Glazed Salmon Filet - Salmon was cooked just right. Flaked with a touch of the fork, but still moist. Sweetness of the glaze was perfect for this dish. 7 oz Black Angus Beef burger - lots of toppings and quite a mess. Big juicy burger! Sweet potato fries was too salty though Wildfire Back Ribs - one of the juiciest fall-off the bone ribs I've ever had at a restaurant.  New York Striploin - I had mine medium rare. It was juicy, with just a bit of fat. Very flavourful. Mashed potatoes was okay. Seasonal vegetables were presented very nicely  Overall, the desserts were a tad too sweet for my taste. The best one was the Chocolate Torte. It felt like an extremely tense brownie with dark chocolate.  Will come again for the steak and ribs even when it's not summerlicious."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Portions are generally large. Good service. Takes the food a little bit of time to come out. The tables in the back provides a better lit area. Overall, I would recommend. Parking can be difficult in winter though."}
{"text":"We visited Wildfire for the first time with our boyfriends for summlicious at lunch. We were impressed at all three courses of the menu, their friendly staff and the beautiful interior. Inside the restaurant, the ambiance was very romantic and intimate with crystal chandeliers, low lighting, candles and dark wood furniture.  It looked very chic - perfect for a date night!   Escargots (snail) Provencal - herbed butter, roasted garlic, shallots and panko topping The snails were chewy and cooked well.  We loved the herbed butter with roasted garlic! Very good for a starter.  If you haven't tried snails before, this would be a great way to try.   Shrimp Martini - tiger shrimp with citrus infused cocktail sauce This was good as well but nothing spectacular.  The shrimp were a good size and very juicy.   Grilled Calamari - with red tomato salsa, capers, black olives and red onions The calamari was cooked perfectly.  Moist and soft without being rubbery.  It went really well with the tomato salsa and the rest of the ingredients! Highly recommended!   Grilled Salmon - with citrus potato galette, julienned carrots, snowpeas and cherry tomatos. We really enjoyed this.  Salmon was grilled perfectly to our liking and came in a generous portion! The fish sat atop the potato galette (pancake) and the julienned veggies.  1/2 Nova Scotia Lobster - garlic drawn butter, mashed potato & seasonal vegetables As a 1/2 size lobster, I didn't think it would be enough, but it did fill me up!  There was plenty of meat in the tail and claw and I couldn't complain since you rarely see lobster on a Summerlicious menu.  It was very tasty, light and satisfying.  It was the perfect portion.   Wildfire Creme Brûlée - made with madagascar vanilla beans Texture was good and I liked that it wasn't too sweet.  It was a delectable finish to the entire meal!   Fresh Berries - Ontario picked raspberries, blackberries and gooseberries This is definitely the lightest dessert on the menu.  We loved the presentation! Simple & Sweet!  Caramel Brownie Cheesecake - brownie base topped with creamy cheesecake drizzled with caramel. This was rich, creamy, sweet and just amazing.  This was my favourite part of the entire meal - I couldn't get enough.  If you like brownies and cheesecake, this is your dream come true!"}
{"text":"We went to Wildfire to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday. The service was outstanding and the food surpassed my expectations. It was a wonderful choice for a special occasion and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a delicious night out any time you want a great meal."}
{"text":"First time going for my dads birthday. Excellent service. They even provided him a hand written birthday card. Their steak is better than the keg."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went here for dinner using the groupon deal on a Saturday night.   The restaurant was pretty full and the ambiance was quite good.   We started with some wine, hor d'oeuvres and warm bread.  The appetizers of Escargot and PEI mussels were good.  For main , we loved the steak and the backribs with shrimp.  The portions were decently big and the food was overall very good!  Our server Rachel was also very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this delightful restaurant twice. On each occasion we were warmly greeted, the ambience was amazing and the meals absolutely delicious. I've had the steak and the chicken and the cook really knows how to cook! My date had fish and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this gem. Just off the beaten path of Yonge Street, it is worth seeking out"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, we sat upstairs in the party room! The food was cooked perfectly and everything was very tasty. The staff was well informed about all the details of the menu and restaurant."}
{"text":"To keep things short, this place does not provide the value for the amount you pay.   The steaks are very meh. I've tried the Striploin, and it was overcooked - definitely not medium rare. The service is also meh. Servers act like they're working at some three Michelin star restaurant, and can be very condescending (especially when you express no interest in their wine list).   At most, Wildfire is just like the Keg, Caseys or Milestones, with a pinch of snobby waiters.   Would not return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet, romantic evening - reminiscent of a mid-tier Chicago steakhouse - go to the Wildfire in the north end!!!  If you're looking for a sports bar to yell at your middle-aged, balding and overweight bros -  THIS is the place for you!!  I felt bad leaving the server a tiny tip - but when you've got to excuse yourself for yelling about the menu (just to be heard) - there's a problem you should be solving.  Letting the bar stack 3 deep so that someone's rear is hanging over the table... atmosphere. The food was decent, though if this wasn't a groupon I'd be upset at the prices when matched up against quality, service and table-ass-ness.  Oh, and I get that at a 'fine dining' restaurant you want to clear the silverware that isn't being used - ensuring the customer has the approriate utensil for the meal...  however, taking my one and only fork because I ordered ribs seems like a poor decision.  Roast veggies with my fingers? No thanks."}
{"text":"Replace the manager with one that knows how to deal with people (after overcharging them and being rude about it?) and you have a restaurant with 3.5 stars. I'm a big fan of the original Wildfire at Yonge uptown but this place was nothing like it. Small, lacking atmosphere, and absolutely mismanaged... The vacant tables are self explanatory...  Never again!"}
{"text":"Almost everyone here was for Winterlicious. The clientele looked like mostly 905ers that didn't want to make their way downtown.  The service was surprisingly good! The hostesses were very friendly and opened the door to greet us. The waitstaff was attentive, smiling, and friendly throughout our entire meal. I was very happy with the service here!  I ordered a non-Winterlicious cocktail to start.  Lunch was after 11am, cocktail time!  My Caesar came with a skewer of pearl onion, green olive, and a shrimp. Refreshing and spicy!  I liked the shrimp from my Caesar and I wanted more shrimp.  For my appetizer I had the shrimp martini. Five large, fresh shrimp served in a martini glass with seafood sauce.  My main was the Nova Scotia 1/2 Lobster.  Our whole table ordered the lobster. It was steamed but it wasn't over cooked. The butter sauce was really good and fun to dunk lobster into. I had another piece of bread and dipped it in my left over butter.  However, the pilaf was pretty inedible.  I should have smothered that in butter too. The grilled veggies were soggy and unappetizing, but I still ate them...yes, with the butter.  You can even ask them to bring you more butter and they will. :)  As for dessert,  I tried the The chocolate mouse and pecan tart.  Not bad but not particularly memorable either.  Overall, I had a nice Winterlicious meal here.  The venue was dimlit, spacious, and much more ambient than expected.  However, I don't think it's a restaurant I would return to for a regular meal."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious lunch and was very impressed! The escargot was fresh and served in fragrant garlic butter, beef dip was soft and flavourful and finally the carrot cake was moist and full of nuts.   Winterlicious will be over soon, but their regular menu was quite reasonably priced so will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holiday evening and room was half-filled.  Pleasant design with subtle lighting it was a soothing space.  Ordered a simple steakhouse dinner of Caesar, Baked Potato and Filet Mignon medium rare.  Steak was absolutely perfect.  Well-aged, perfectly grilled with deep flavor.  Sides were a mix as potato was fine and grilled veg excellent but broccoli a bit undercooked with no detail.  Wine list decent but by the glass or carafe limited and Niagara blend was \"blunt.\"  High point of the evening was, by far, the staff.  Attentive but not obtrusive, friendly not familiar.  Chef came out to check with tables and was genuinely interested.  Strong recommendation."}
{"text":"An amazing experience, and a wonderful way to end my trip in Canada. My husband and I enjoyed everything from the food to the service."}
{"text":"Bar review only: Came here around 10:30p on a Friday night, sat at the bar and wanted to get a dessert to share and a couple drinks. Hostess was less than thrilled to see us, even though there were still plenty of tables in the restaurant. We sat at the bar and no one asked for our drink order although many people walked by. Since the waitress was right near us cleaning glasses and silverware I asked her if we could place a drink order and she said \"I'm not the bartender\" Finally we get a drink and ask to see the dessert menu- the hostess then says \"the kitchen closes at 11pm so they probably aren't going to get you anything\".. were talking a premade dessert here people, not some extravagant wedding cake. and at this point it was maybe 10:45p! Went back and forth and it was clear they didn't care or want our business and at that point we got our check and decided it wasn't worth staying to finish our drinks. Hopefully everyone else has a better time than we did. Much nicer places in Toronto to check out!"}
{"text":"It was a ~Winterlicous kind of visit~!!! Booking: 4/5-The Greeter was very friendly & accommodating! Was easily booked by calling rather than completing it on-line (availability showed no bookings for the date & time we wanted & ended up booking for by phone).  We were actually late & they still accommodated us.   Location:  4/5-North side of downtown Toronto, about a 20 minute drive from my area (Jane & Sheppard). Convenient parking, directly in front of the location. $3.00 for an hour parking on the street. Also accessible by TTC.   Venue: 5/5-Very warm greeting as you enter with a Host who opens the door for you & welcomes you inside. Beautiful ambiance and beautiful decor, love the colours and the overall table set up (we got a booth for 4 people...my favourite type of seating). We were seated within 5 mins. Washrooms are located downstairs, so not sure this is accessible for a person with physical restrictions. Washroom stalls are frosted glass, very nice & different including the sink area & very clean with very soft toilet paper. The wall directly across from us had a very interesting pattern...appears blurry but it was interesting!   Service & Food: 4/5-We had a very Happy server, who was very accommodating & friendly!  The food choices for winterlicous & taste were excellent!!! The romaine leaf served with the chicken is grilled & very tasty. However; the chicken served with it was salty. The taste of the burger was phenomenon! The three course options were brought within great time of each other...enough time to digest each item between each course.   And the cost...About $140 (including Taxes & gratuity, no drinks only water) for 4 people eating a 3 course delicious meal...not bad!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, using Groupon. Sat at the bar first and enjoyed their amazing house made chips and a reasonably priced cocktail ($8). Not best drink (bourbon sour) and room for improvement here. When friends arrived, we were seated promptly and enjoyed fabulous service from our very attentive waiter. Very impressed with service as restaurant was packed. Escargots were fantastic, not overly garlic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the very generous portion of tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs. Creme brulee was outstanding-so creamy with lots of fresh vanilla. Other guests at table enjoyed well cooked steaks, and we were all pretty happy by end of meal. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We got a groupon for a four course dinner with wine. It was delicious! The calamari was just the way I like it. The striploin was cooked to my liking while my other half had the ribs which were also good but there were too many of them. The creme brûlée and cheesecake were both very good.  The staff were nice and courteous although a little slow."}
{"text":"Sadly the food quality has gone downhill! I've been here a couple of times recently and was disappointed. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either. For the experience the price definitely wasn't worth it. Even the Keg has been more consistent!  It's a beautiful restaurant, but sadly I don't think I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends here while I was in town on business.  I have to say it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  I  had the grilled pork tenderloin which was nothing less than perfect.  Moist and flavorful paired with rosemary roasted potatoes.  One of my friends had the 10oz filet he ordered it medium rare and with it being such a large piece of meat the center was just a little too rare but it would have been nearly impossible to have the piece cooked med rare without the outer part being done med well.  My other friend ordered off the Winterlicious menu which is a great deal.  For $45 it is 3 courses and the selection is great.  Atmosphere was lovely and the service was impeccable.  I will definitely try to return on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Recently went here for dinner during Winterlicious.  Noticed that they renovated the place since the first time I went there about 2 years ago. The new touches are nice, although they went a little overkill on the 'moodlighting'. You can barely see around you or what you're eating. Luckily where I sat was directly under a spot light. Other than the dark lighting, I enjoy the vibe. The waitress was also extremely nice, patient (as we had been a fairly decent sized table that changed their mind/had many requests).  Table ordered escargot, mushroom soup, and shrimp cocktail for apps. So yummy. I got the shrimp. I love their cocktail sauce infused w/ vodka. The escarot were okay. I've had better. They were smaller than I'd prefer and it seemed to have more breadcrumbs and cheese than snail. I didn't taste the soup.  For dinner 4 out of 5 ordered the whole lobster, one ordered mushroom risotto. The risotto was good. I'd prefer a different type as i got tired of the mushrooms easily. Risotto's a tricky dish to perfect though, so I was happy.  The menu said lobster...but I wasn't expecting an entire one. It was a pleasant surprise as our prix fixe was 45$. We got down and dirty with that bad boy. It was so good. Steamed, offered with butter. Side veggies were good too.  Dessert was good too. I was satisfied with the chocolate mousse. Friends didn't like their pecan pie though.  If basing it on the first time I went, I'd probably give it a 2. It was for lunch though and it was before the renovations. Food then was horrible.  Maybe its the new renos or a new chef that gave me the turn around on this resto. Would def pay full price for this place."}
{"text":"Came here with a client and we were a group of 8.  Asked for a private dining area to ensure we weren't talking over others during dinner.  When we got there we were seated promptly.   The server seemed like he was in a complete rush to get us in and out. I felt pressured to order quickly when I didn't have a chance to even look at the menu.  I had the risotto which I didn't enjoy- the pasta looked better.   Even when it came to ordering dessert- he dropped off the menu and returned right away.   Post dessert, we got the bill, and after that was paid, we never saw him again. I would have thought we would have at the minimum got some more tap water but nothing.   Not a place I'd recommend again."}
{"text":"This was good experience, my wife and I went there during winterliciouse last January.  The 8 Colborne street location was quaint and pleasant. My steak was good, the service five star and the over all night was great.   Minimal parking around here, so if you can, Uber. Reasonable in the pricing department, great wine selection.  If you prefer a quite night out, this is the place."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with good food and drink and superb service. Perhaps because it was a slow, late Thursday evening, but I felt treated like a king by the waitress, Angela, the \"general manager\", and even the chef, Josh.  First, Angela went out of her way to keep me informed of options and give her sage opinions, when asked. She even allowed me to do a blinded taste test between two cabernets, one of which I selected from the menu, the other she recommended.  I had a small Caesar salad with a 'blue' (seared on the outside and cool pink throughout) 7 oz. filet mignon, which was excellent. This apparently drew out Josh to see who would order this dish and introduce himself. Both he and Angela took pains to offer to throw the meat back on the grill if I wasn't satisfied.  Finally, Angela twisted my rubber arm and brought me their creme brulee, topped with strawberry, blueberries, and gooseberry, on the house!  The price would have seemed a bit steep if not for the service. I thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I went years ago when they first opened but was disappointed with the food. I'm surprised they are still in business. Figured maybe it has improved why not give it a chance. I ordered the spaghettini. The flavours aren't bad but the noodles are spaghetti noodles. The manager with a straight face explained to me how similar these noodles are. WOW!  He really thinks people can't tell the difference. Most of the food was bland. Finally, as a maritimer, the first rule of cooking lobster is to salt the water you boil it in. They must have missed that in culinary school because that was the most bland lobster you could ever imagine. Disappointing. I could gave gone to Miller's Tavern or the Keg instead. Oh well. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their summerlicious menu last night. fan freaking tastic. first of all their summerlicious menu had more options on it than any other summerlicious menu I have seen so far.  We made reservations for 8:30(made at 8) and were told that we might have a 10-15 min wait as they were super busy. We got there around 8:15 content to sit at the bar and wait. after 2 minutes our table was ready.  The restaurant itself has a very New York feel to it.  The service was slow but the food and atmosphere were amazing.   appies grilled calamari- 5/5 caprese salad-4/5 shrimp martini- 4/5  entrees 1 1/4 lobster- 5/5 baby back ribs- 5/5 angel hair pasta- 4/5  deserts chocolate mousse- 3/5 red velvet- 5/5  repeat/ definitely"}
{"text":"Service very good!  Meats are totally over seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning which is VERY salty.  Such a shame as the quality of meat is very good.  It is no Capital Grille or Abe and Louie's.  The salt is still lingering in my mouth:("}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, juicy fresh meet. The experience was in general pleasant. If you love meet, give them a try. They know how to cook their meet. I am a steak lover and this was one of the better steakhouses i have been to."}
{"text":"I went to Wildfire last night with my husband and two children. Let me start by saying we have been to Wildfire many, many times the past several years, more than 7 times. It has always been our family favourite. Our expectation when we go here is great food, steak cooked to perfection and amazing service. We went last night for my husband's birthday. We thought we would get a meal to remember, but we were sadly disappointed. I kept on apologizing to my husband for taking him there.   I am used to someone greeting us when we enter, and holding the door open. No one was at the front desk. We waited for her to come back and acknowledge us. We were seat, and our waitress was okay, in the past we had Keith who was phenomenal. I had purchased a Groupon for two with alcohol. In the past, we were able to get a cocktail (a martini), but we were not allowed this time. I noticed many of the waiters were fairly new, but didn't think anything of it. We gave our order and my husband and I had ordered steaks medium well as this is our meal EVERY TIME we go to Wildfire. They both came well done and to my impression smaller, not as good a quality as previous steaks. This is the first time in all the many times we have been to Wildfire that we had to return our food. The waitress came, and seemed to go on saying what it means to have steaks medium well, and how it should look. ( I got the impression she doubted we knew how we liked our steaks). Then she looked at our steak and agreed it was over cooked. She actually asked us if we wanted a new steak...?? Of course we wanted a new steak! Then she took our steak away while we ate the rest of our meal (veg and mash potatoes/fries). Even the mash potatoes which I usually love, seemed blah. When the steak came eventually 15 minutes later, we were done our sides, so ate the steak alone. Sure she apologized, but the experience was gone.   The waitress disappeared, only came once to fill our glasses with wine and water. Someone else came by eventually because our waitress was busy. They were nice enough to bring a cheesecake for my husband with a sparkler on it, but had brought a wrong dessert for my son. So in the confusion of having all the desserts brought at the same time...the birthday surprise was lost. The waitress never came back, another person took our bill. We had purchased a groupon, but ended up buying over $100 worth of other things on the menu. It wasn't like this meal was cheap because the groupon also cost $98! I asked the Server who gave us our bill (btw different person), \"Is the management different? Things have changed.\" He said \"No it hasn't changed\" I said it is very obviously different, and not in a good way. We left and usually they say \"bye, thank you for coming\" when we leave and open the door, but not at this time. My husband and I won't be going back anytime soon. Wildfire is definitely not to the calibre we were used to."}
{"text":"Most  disappointing . Was here last week for a business lunch. Lovely ambience but the food was plain awful. I ordered the bassa. Lovely menu description. I was salivating as I read it, but what I got was an under spiced piece of thin fish from frozen. Over cooked on the edges under cooked in the middle, undercooked veggies with way too much oil on them and a grey clump of tasteless mashed. The mixed berries for desert were wilted and mushie! All that for a prix fix of $30. Lunch for two taxes and tip was $90. I expect way more then that. My client left most of his ribs lunch untouched. The service was very amateurish. The waiter kept interrupting us not the reading the situation at all and did not know the first thing about the menu and the way the food was prepared. Pretty poor. Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I took advantage of Summerlicious pricing ($45 for 3 course dinner) and had dinner at Wildfire on Sun night. The place was packed (good thing we made a reservation) but the service was courteous and friendly. It was also quite fast considering how busy the place was. We ordered escargot and calamari for appetizers and New Your steak and artic char for the main course. My husband and I shared everything, so here are my ratings for these dishes: - escargot - 5* (perfectly done, soft and delicious) - calamari - 4* (ok, but not great, a bit overdone) - steak - 3* (we asked for medium-rear and received medium-well done) - fish - 5* (cooked to perfection)  We finished the dinner with deserts, I had creme brulee and my husband had cheesecake, both were very good. Wines there are quite expensive, they start at $45-50 and they were out of most red wines in this price range. We had a bottle of Argentinian Malbec, it was pretty average but the bottle cost $65. All in all, it was a good value thanks to Summerlicious pricing, if I had to pay a full price I'd probably rate Wildfire as 3-3.5 stars re price to food quality."}
{"text":"The staff was exceptional and the food outstanding.  The freshly baked  bread was amazing.  The three of us each had the Rib Eye, each expertly prepared.  The knowledgeable wait staff provided us expert advice and paired our food perfectly.  This is truly a hidden gem of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Don't think this is a \"big city\" steak house like Ruth Chris or something similar. It's in a hotel or condo complex, not sure what it is. Wait staff was super nice, but I had the 7oz filet that was dry and overcooked. Meat was tough and didn't seem to be the grade they listed in the menu. I just cooked some tenderloin filets at home last night, three of us for $18. They blew this away and I think I paid $38 for the filet."}
{"text":"We were in this restaurant being in Toronto for a fair and we find very kind waiter and good food. Only problem was about how they cooked our steaks ,mistaken any our order ! Probably they must change their communications system between the waiters and the kitchen :) Always the very clever waiter that served us gave a perfect advice on the vine for the dinner. At the end  ..good but not a place sure to return...."}
{"text":"A picture is worth a thousand words; so is one bite of a robust juicy steak.  When Wildfire Steakhouse & Wine Bar opened it's doors at it's new downtown location, it did so with a cosmopolitan makeover, but with the same classic menu as its North York location that has established itself as one of Toronto's great steak houses. Modern tweaks appeal to vegetarians. We're hard pressed to think of another steak restaurant that caters to vegetarians and also proudly lists gluten-free options.  While the cocktail crowd nibbles on crunchy polenta cubes and succulent chipotle and lime-marinaded beef kabobs, our eyes are on the racks of lamb, tangy ribs and piri piri chicken whisked to neighbouring tables. But we've come here for the steak. Aged in-house for forty days, this quality Canadian beef is as tender as it gets. Owner, Jody Ness, has his finger on the pulse with an urban-chic vibe, but knows that you can't fake a great steak. Melting in house-made butters like peppercorn, shallot truffle, and blue cheese, add a creamy essence to already mouthwatering morsels.  Serving an award winning selection of wines in an unpretentious ambience, right in the heart of Toronto's financial district, Ness delivers on his motto of hospitality, \"one guest at a time\"."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The service is top notch! Food was incredible ! You can also choose from a variety of sea salt flavors - neat!! Highly recommend - I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I thought the ribs where really good, but if I didn't have a coupon, the dinner would have been really expensive.  Well worth it if you are lucky enough to go with a groupon, or dealfind voucher, or even for winterlicious.  I found the service really good, and the waiter was very helpful.  We even got a warm goodbye as we left."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for our Anniversary and had a Groupon for our special dinner. Kind of tacky taking the menus off our hands when we mentioned Groupon. They gave us a piece of paper with the Groupon menu.  TACKY ! TASTELESS !!  Our meals were excellent and we had a great Anniversary dinner celebration.  Service was great too ."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Went with a Groupon with my husband to celebrate our Anniversary. Food and service were excellent! Can't say enough good things about this beautiful and clea restaurant."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing experience. There were three of us at dinner, all three filet mignon's were tough, and our 'loaded' baked potatoes were dry. Service was overall good, but ultimately the food is the most important thing."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes from any restaurant that likes to call themselves a Steakhouse!  I got the Porterhouse with truffle butter, which you can see from the pictures, isn't melted on top and didn't really melt. The idea to finish the steak in truffle butter would have been better, so that the steak in resting could absorb the flavors. The steak was cooked perfectly  to medium rare and was okay. Not a lot of marbling and more so, not the high quality I had expected but that's not on the restaurant, its more about managing my expectations.   The Beet salad was tasty but the presentation was off. I seemed like a salad, I would put together at home and I felt not enough Goat cheese on there for a  good balance!   At the end of the day, decent, run of the mill place, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in town from Chicago, celebrating our wedding anniversary. We decided to try Wildfire for our romantic anniversary dinner spot and we are so happy we did. Matteo, the GM, offered stellar service and was so gracious upon taking our reservation over the phone and (without knowing whether we were dining at the restaurant or going into the hotel) helping us find parking in front of the restaurant when we arrived. The four course meal was delicious and our server, Tara, was so welcoming and attentive. When I wasn't a fan on of the appetizer I selected, Tara quickly got Matteo and he happily handled it and brought me out another appetizer of my choice. The night ended with a \"Happy 4th Anniversary\" message spelled out in chocolate sauce along with yummy dessert and the GM snapping a few pics of hubby and I to remember this awesome night out. We highly recommend checking out this beautiful restaurant with amazing cuisine and service."}
{"text":"Food was as expected for the price charged. I like my steak medium rare, however, it came out more medium; not a big deal.  The reason for the two stars is the service; the services is as bad as it got on the Friday night we visited. We ordered two beers and they arrived not before our apps, not after our apps but midway through our main. When I asked for a second beer it came 40 minutes later during my desert with my coffee. What was the waitress thinking?  The whole dinning experience was almost 3 hours, about an hour of which was waiting for service including 30 minutes waiting for our bill.  How does this place stay in business."}
{"text":"Located just south of Yonge Boulevard on Yonge street, this restaurant features high end fine-dining. Not to mention that there is a wine bar at the side that features hundreds of wine from all over the world. If you have no problem finding parking, it is a good place to have good high end food.  I came here as a result of my company's lunch. Although it is a set menu, I can get an idea the kind of food that they usually serve. First, all are in huge portions. The steak, appetizer like grilled salad or just soup are huge. Be prepared to be hungry if you want to eat.  I don't like how they can't get the level of cooking on the steak right. If you say medium well, it comes in with medium rare.   Just be careful"}
{"text":"Called Wildfire at 7:15PM on Saturday; asked for an 8PM reservation... gentleman by the name Shaun said sure come in, there's no dress code.  Show up at 8:02PM; line-up out the door... They're seating people since 7:00PM... and they don't have my reservation, ask me to wait 30 minutes (at least).  They even knew the name of who took my reservation while shaking their heads talking to each other.  Didn't offer anything, no sympathy, nothing.  TERRIBLE customer service.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Wildfire Steakhouse & Wine Bar I went here on a date and I used a Groupon.  The Groupon was for a four-course meal and wine.  It was easy to book a reservation using opentable (website).  I found all the items to be really good.  The portions were also generous, which is find is rare.  I would definitely go back.   The only thing I didn't like was that I was seated close to the entrance.  Next time I will request to have a seat that is further into the restaurant to experience more of the ambiance."}
{"text":"2nd time here for simmerlicous ! I have tried so many Summerlicous menu for many years and this one offered the best value menu. 28 dollars lunch menu has escargot, half lobster and a dessert ! I have also tried calamari has appetizer, which was not bad. But I like escargot better. Lobster is definitely the choice to go with compared to all other main courses. Restaurants is modern and well-decorated. It was also quite so that you could have some conversation with Frds and family. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious with 6 of my fellow coworkers. I had escargots to start, followed by the New York strip loin with a blue cheese butter and a creme brûlée for dessert. Everything tastes great and was worth the $45 price I paid. If I were to go again, I'd order the calamari fritti which I managed to steal off my friends' plates."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day. Have to say I am pretty disappointed as a first time visitor. The appetizer, desert, service are all good to great, and the mashed potato is exquisite. But there is a reason why it's called a \"steak\"house - the steak has to be good! But unfortunately it is VERY underwhelming, even downright disappointing. The cooking is probably not bad, but the material - as in the piece of meat they used, is very poor, resulting in a very poor quality steak. Anyway, for a $250 dinner I will take my business somewhere else. Here's hoping Wildfire staff sees this and takes it heart to improving their source of meat."}
{"text":"Came here mid-week to celebrate a birthday and we all had a great time. The ambience is modern steakhouse chic, comfortable, quiet, perfect for conversation. The staff were friendly, pretty knowledgeable and relatively prompt, most of the time. The menus clearly indicate vegetarian and gluten free dishes, which makes dining much easier for any pursuing those options. We started off with the grilled calamari and the beef carpaccio. Both were very good. The calamari was well grilled but not overcooked, and the carpaccio was very traditional. The kids weren't too fussy on the polenta fries, but the adults liked them. So far so good. For dinner we went with steaks, of course. I had the 16oz rib steak, which was perfectly cooked medium rare. Better than that is the executive cut 24oz rib steak. The veal chop was also excellent - tender and tasty. We had the sweet potato fries, mushroom ragout and asparagus sides, and all were truly excellent. The wine list is surprisingly deep and covers every segment you might expect at a premium steakhouse. In fact, this wine list surpasses that of any steak house I have been to in the same price range - and I have been to many! The steaks themselves are good, well aged, but I found them a bit chewy, as if they had not started with the best quality beef in the first place. Still, the steaks were perfectly cooked and quite tasty, despite the gristle. Desserts were also excellent. We had the crème brulee, house made ice cream and the chocolate torte. All were decadent and as rich and fulfilling as one could want. All in all, this was a great night out. My judgement is that this is a step up from The Keg both in terms of overall dining experience, wine list and price."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!   I'm a sucker for good food and this place does a perfect job.   However, it's sort of hard to find if you're driving, you can easily miss it. The restaurant is in a corner. But the food is worth it   Ambience - 3.5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Food - 5/5"}
{"text":"My friend and I went on the four course groupon deal for my birthday, and it was AMAZING. Although we arrived at 9:30, and they close at 10:00... they were very happy to serve our four courses without rushing us. I will tell you the mussels in the garlic cream sauce were divine, and my friend had the tomato sauce and that was excellent as well. Onto the main, our steaks were perfectly done, tender and juicy. Wow. I had wanted to take a picture but I had just dived right in. And dessert. I can say one of the best creme brulees I have ever had. So creamy and rich, with a hint of vanilla, and because it was my birthday, they did something special with it. I can definitely say that it wasn't only the food but also the service that stood out  in my mind. Our waitress Carly was so attentive, patient and thoughtful... would definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Hit the Wildfire for a Winterlicious lunch.  Luckily because of \"Snowmagedon\", this place was dead and without a reservation we were able to go.  As with all Winterlicious reviews, it's different from their regular service, but in this case, because of how quiet it was, I think we probably got above average service and attention.  It's a wonderful space with lots of dark wood.  But I can imagine it getting quite loud and echo-y if the space fills up.  Decent selection off the Prix fix.  I had the escargot, ribs and the cheese cake.  The escargot was ok  but was a bit under seasoned.  As much as it was quite oily, it lacked the buttery taste I expect with that much butter involved.  The dry rub ribs were.. well a bit dry.  I did enjoy the cheesecake, but by that time I was quite done.  I pretty much had to throw in the towel.  Overall, this place really didn't light my fire for $25 + tax +tip + bevies lunch.  You know that it would be untrue  You know that I would be a liar  If I was to say to you  Girl, we couldn't get much higher   It set me looking for The Doors and I was a bit underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our dinner at this cute restaurant. This restaurant is located in downtown Toronto and you will miss the entrance if you don't look hard for the sign. This area and the whole downtown Toronto area reminded me of a cleaner New York. The restaurant does not have nearby parking, so you have to search the area for parking garages in the few blocks over. Wildfire is inside the Cosmopolitan hotel( not in connection with the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas) and please note the first receptionist you see (when you walk in the entrance) is not for the restaurant but the hotel. Behind the second set of doors is the entrance to the restaurant and where you can find your hostess.  My husband purchased a groupon for our meal and made a reservation. It is a good thing he did because the restaurant is not that big and we may have had a wait, if it wasn't for the reservation. We arrived promptly at our reservation time but the hostess said they needed a couple minutes to finish preparing the table. After a couple minutes we were called to be seated. A few minutes after we were seated our nice waitress came over and introduced herself. Our waitress was super sweet and so accommodating to our request all night. One thing that kind of threw me was the restaurant had house chips--like actual potato chips instead of bread or something else. Don't get me wrong the chips were good but the restaurant seemed upscale so the chips threw me off. After my husband came in from parking the car we got started with our 4 course meal. The restaurant had a set menu written up for our groupon deal, which made it easier to know what we could choose. Our first course was a set appetizer tray, with multiple finger foods for us to try. The waitress made sure we had no allergies before the chef prepared the tray. Everything on the appetizer tray tasted good.Next we could choose another appetizer. The hubby and I choose Calamari and my dad and daughter choose a salad. I made a mistake ordering the calamari. I assumed it was fried and it wasn't. Since I didn't like the calamari the waitress was very accommodating and took the calamari back and brought a house salad which was good. For my main course I got the apple seasoned pork chops. I enjoyed this as well and loved the apple toppings on the pork chops. My husband's steak was also prepared pretty good. Last but not least was my favorite--the dessert! I opted for the cheese cake which was ummmm ummm GOOD! I'm not sure how I made room in my stomach but I did!! The cheese cake and fresh toppings were soooo good! Some of the best cheese cake I have had in a while! My husband ordered the carrot cake which was also very moist and tasted amazing! For my drink I tried the 2013 Merlot and a Cabernet. The Cabernet wine appealed more to my liking. My husband also let them know it was my daughter's birthday and they prepared a special ice cream, said happy bday, and gave her a card.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, our server, food, and  the lighting. I wish the restaurant  was a little bigger and they had closer parking but I really enjoyed our family dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here because we had an online deal for it. I had the rib steak, and it was juicy, tender and flavourful! The side mashed potatoes and veggies were really good too. I ate every bite.  The ambiance was nice, we were sat upstairs but our table for two was separated by this heavy curtain and my right arm was constantly sweeping against it, but no big deal.   Service was excellent, very friendly wait staff.   Would love to try their brunch one day."}
{"text":"Nice little place, great atmosphere, few spots in the restaurant.  We came in with a Groupon deal and had some pretty amazing food.  My steak was cooked exactly as I asked, rare, which most places screw up.  The creme brulee was definitely the highlight though, very creamy, velvety, and used real vanilla beans.  Our server Maxwell was awesome, attentive, funny, and had great recommendations.  I would definitely go back food was great, and experience was awesome."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious lunch, $28. The atmosphere was quite dark but very nice decor. The food was good and filling as I had to pack some up. I wouldn't say anything was extremely special seeing as this restaurant seems to be towards the higher end of the scale but I had no regrets trying this place out and Summerlicious was the perfect time to do it. I was a little disappointed by the fish I ordered as it was very salty but the garlic mash was very good. I was also able to try some of the ribs and they were very good, I especially loved the sauce on them. Staff was very pleasant and always around to help and food was always hot. Warning though, they're plates were extremely hot to the touch and the server did not warn us about them and I nearly burned my fingers!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 4 for Winterlicious. I've never had high expectations for the quality of service or food during these events, but I was not impressed with our experience at Wildfire.  This review is mainly for the quality of service we received and the dishes I was able to try from our table.   Some hiccups happened with our dinner reservation and as a result we had to wait 10-15 minutes. The bartender was nice enough to provide us each with a glass of bubbly on the house.   Appetizers: Caesar  salad and calamari. The Caesar salad was soggy and subpar at best, and the calamari was undercooked and too gooey for my liking.   Main: Lobster came out cold, and when I told my server, they simply either microwaved it or put it back in the steamer. Either way, it over cooked my lobster and it came back to me rubbery.  The ribs were actually pretty good, they were moist and flavorful. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was also good. The fries and mashed potatoes as our sides tasted old, as if they've been sitting around all day.  Dessert: creme brûlée and caramel cheesecake were good.  The warm fresh bread and hummus and dessert were probably the best parts of my meal, which frankly is quite sad to say.  Service: our server Steve never once asked us how our meal was, never asked if we needed anything, never filled up our water until we specifically asked after my glass had reached empty, mumbled a half assed apology for my cold entree. Our server seriously did not give a single F that night. However, the food runners were sincerely apologetic and were happy to fill our waters for us.  Overall, thoroughly disappointing experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"For a specialty steakhouse I was very disappointed. I definitely like the cover of this book, and I judged incorrectly. Fortunately I was not too invested in this excursion as it was a \"Summerlicious\" experiment. The \"star\" rating for this establishment (my two and the average of 3) is appropriate.   My steak looked the way it should be; with the cross hatchet grill marks, but it lacked seasoning, lacked the grill or charcoal or something that would make the steak amazing. The way I see it; if I can whip up a better steak on my home BBQ, I would have to give a failing mark (anyone who knows me, knows I don't like to cook, and I am incapable of making any decent meals; however, my BBQ'ing abilities along with my wife's secret seasoning, wow's my friends and family).  Lastly, our server was was attentive, lively, and made our visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"Located underneath the Cosmopolitan hotel, this restaurant is quite cozy and intimate. The service was extremely attentive, and the food was excellent. I ordered a rare filet mignon and asked for a loaded baked potato (the whole shebang: sour cream etc) while my boyfriend had the medium rare filet mignon. Personally I like my steak rare. The texture just does it for me and my opinion is if a steak is well done...it loses its magic (too dry, chewy, hard to eat) if you know what I mean. But anyhow, that's a whole other debate. I digress.   Honestly I felt that Wildfire is a notch higher than The Keg's quality of steak. There definitely was a different taste between the two, probably the cut and quality of the beef. I do also find the price range reasonable. This is not a upscale/high end steakhouse but it's pretty up there, at least to me,  Definitely go and check it out if you don't want to fork out too much for steak!"}
{"text":"For a summerlicious menu and portions, I'd have to give them 3 stars. With excellent service bringing it to a 4.   I came with out law family for a meal, and the summerlicious menu and price of $38 was quite decent.  Most of us had the filet minion or the orange roughy.  The apps included ceaser salad. It was a head of romaine lettuce cut in half and the lightly charred. Ceaser salad dressing, bacon, parmesan cheese and tiny tiny croutons. The salad was most exciting. For those who don't like the slightly bitter charred flavour, this is definitely not for you. For those who like interesting flavours this is a must try.  They were pretty busy. We were seated at the \"chefs table\" which was literally right beside the kitchen. During several rushes you could see quite a few plates under the hot lamps. So when the filets came quite a few were slightly over done. For example a medium rare came out more medium. The rare and blue rare was fine as those came out last.  They serve the entire table at the same time. Hence some being under light for a little longer.  The second \"wow\" to my delight was the parmesan truffle oil polenta fries. It was added as a side. Oh my oh my totally worth the $6 I paid.  Of the 3 desserts, the New York cheesecake was the most tasty. It was moist and the crust was delicate, not overly sweet. The carrot cake was also very good. The chocolate cake was my least fav, as it was a little too sweet and the cake not as moist.  Overall the service and experience is worth a repeat."}
{"text":"Tonight is my second night having dinner at Wildfire. I'm visiting for work and staying at this lovely hotel and Wildlfire is nestled right in the heart of this darling experience.  Last night, after getting in from 12 hrs of flying i was in no mood to explore. Wildfire is on the ground floor of the hotel and I rallied to get some dinner. With only 30 minutes to close, the service could not have been more gracious and kind. I know you're not supposed to order that close to closing but i was so desperate! I started with the grilled octopus, which had a beautiful presentation and a delicious sauce.  I moved on to the Bavette - apparently a Canadian favorite - it was perfectly portioned and cooked to perfection. Tonight I'm treating myself to a rack of ribs and a shrimp cocktail, while sipping a beautiful Manhattan.  I'm thrilled this restaurant is so close and so may try the breakfast tomorrow! Service is impeccable.  Ps forgot to add - extensive gluten free menu options!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our wedding anniversary. The restaurant is situated within the cosmopolitan hotel. The restaurant had a nice vibe to it when you come in and the staff are extremely friendly. Our waitress was perfect and made the experience good.  We ordered an appetizer which I believe was a steak appetizer which was seasoned perfectly! It really made our taste buds excited for the main course. My husband ordered the filet with blue cheese crust and I ordered the New York strip. The main course was just O.K. It was a little disappointing when you call yourself a steakhouse and our temps were off. I asked for my strip to be medium and it was more on the verge of being medium well/well done. How can you do that to a strip? My husband enjoyed his filet though and it was a little under the medium rare aspect. However, the cute aspect of the restaurant was they gave us a dessert that they customized to say Happy Anniversary with a sparkler. That was very sweet.   3 stars out of five because if your a steakhouse I expect to get my steaks at the temp I ask for."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.   I came here last night for a family dinner and I have to say the experience was very underwhelming for what I thought was going to be a more upscale experience. The experience wasn't horrible but there were a lot of little things that bothered me, especially for what you pay.   - Bread must be requested. This was no problem, except that the bread came before our bread plates and the waiter didn't pick up on this until 5-10 minutes later.  - The waiter gave 3/4 of the individuals at the table steak knives, and forgot to take away two people's other butter knives. He walked away and then remembered to take away the unused butter knives, and finally remembered to give the last person a steak knife. Our dirty plates and bread bowl remained on the table until the servers realized they couldn't fit all the dinner plates on the table.  - When all four steaks came, the servers announced, \"I have a steak here,\" while waiting for us to point out which ones were ours or something. Um, we all ordered steaks? If there's only four people at the table it's not difficult to make a mental note of who ordered which cut and which sides. We played musical plates three times until we all finally had the right plates.  - The steak was mediocre. I had a great cut (centre sirloin) but it lacked flavour-- kind of felt like something I could have just whipped up at home. It had a hint of a cheesy flavour which was a little off-putting because there was no mention of this seasoning on this steak (otherwise I would have ordered a different cut).   I have to give the servers kudos for trying their hardest but I personally like sticking to other steakhouses like The Keg for consistent quality and service.   Overall, not a horrible experience but I feel like you pay more for the ambience than anything. Probably wouldn't come back just because there wasn't anything special about this restaurant."}
{"text":"When you hear teenagers arguing from the kitchen you can't expect anything great. We went years ago and haven't been back. The food was really bad. Steak was tough, overcooked and just plain low quality. There are so many great restaurants in this city...why go here?"}
{"text":"For this price, I'm positive that the service/food can be better. I went here for dinner one day, had a bottle of wine with steak. Spent more than a couple hundred for a family of three. To be honest, I had high hopes before going here so that might have been why I got disappointed."}
{"text":"There are a lot of interesting restaurants in this neighbourhood. And my first impression of this one had me turned off so I never whent back. But I do ask the locals and very few ever say they go to the Wildfire. Perhaps too pricey."}
{"text":"The food took little bit long but the service was good. Small restaurant but very cozy. It's nice to have a partner here."}
{"text":"Quiet, romantic, sophisticated atmosphere. Came here for my birthday dinner on a weekday. Not busy at all, no complaints in wait time. Had an excellent very friendly server, he was very kind and professional. The cheesy garlic bread was delicious. We both ordered filet mignons \"medium rare\" and received steaks that were definitely on the blue rare - rare side. After eating a few slices we couldn't do it anymore and decided to send it back. Our waiter had no problem with that but his co-worker or boss, not sure, (short black haired guy with glasses), proceeded to try and tell us that it looked perfectly medium rare to him and basically tried to convince us that it was medium rare, and we were wrong. I did not appreciate this, but they did take both meals back and made us a new one. The new steaks were thinner cuts, a little better that we didn't want to complain a second time, but still not impressive. Our server was very nice and we understand it was not his fault, just glad we didn't get his co-worker as our server as then we would likely not want to tip. Overall not too impressed and we do not want to go back. Definitely looks like they need to improve their meal consistency."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have still not written a review on this place yet, I have been here more times than my hand can count.  The staff here is extremely polite and even stays open late (past 11pm) for our xmas party.  The food is actually really good here except for the salads.  The steaks are cookers perfectly and as ordered. a perfect medium rare. very smooth and melts in my mouths. they even do good ribs and lam racks!  The creme brulee is a must have for dessert here, they are always consistent with this one.  the only problem is that it's hard to find parking here, and those floors on the first floor is kind of slippery especially in the winter when it gets wet."}
{"text":"This place looks very nice. Has good staff.  Food is so so. Nothing fancy.  Very over priced $100 a person for a full dinner, not worth so so food.  Got placed at the worst table at the restaurant that seems to be the staff dinner table. It was loud in the kitchen and I can hear everything since I was kind of in the kitchen.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that Wildfire was one of the options on the Summerlicious restaurant list because if it wasn't then I would've never discovered this place.   The set menu is $38 per person that comes with an appetizer, entree and dessert which I believe is worth it.  For appetizer, I got the escargot. I liked how they weren't small escargot and you knew what you were eating. They were drowned in butter and though that's sometimes good, I got a little sick of it and had to shake the butter off.  My partner got the tenderloin beef skewers and it tasted so good, it was cooked medium rare and the glaze they put on it is so sweet and delicious. I enjoyed the fact that the meat was so tender and I didn't spent so much time trying to chew it.   Entrees we got the Filet Mignon and Bone In Veal, both came with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, a piece of corn, and mashed potatoes. The Filet Mignon was okay, something I wouldn't recommend because my partner had to spit out two pieces because he said they were so chewy. But the Filet Mignon was perfect, though I asked for rare and it came out medium rare.   The dessert we got were Carrot Cake and Cheesecake and for both I have no complaints. They were both moist and delicious and not overly sweet!   The service was lovely as for any restaurant that's more on the classy side should be. Though when my partner asked for another serving of demi glaze to finish his Veal, it did take quite sometime for the waiter to get us it but not that big of a deal.   Overall, very glad I picked this place for Summerlicious!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Food wasn't the best though. My family and I ordered the double chicken breast, filet mignon, and 2 prime ribs. Chicken breast were delicious, very juicy! The prime ribs, however, were over cooked and way too charred! Ordered it in medium rare but received an almost well done.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner. This was our first time at this restaurant. We didn't even know of this place until we saw a Groupon deal for it. It was a 4 course Groupon with wine for 2 people deal. All the servers at this restaurant are very professional. Our server in particular was nice and friendly. We even strike up a conversation with her. She was very personable and provided good service. I really liked that she was able to provide good recommendations for wine choices.   I found the seating to be comfortable and intimate. Although there were people at the bar watching the Raptors game, it wasn't loud in the restaurant. I think this place is great for the special occasion date nights.   As it was a Groupon deal, the menu is condensed version of their menu. For the main, my boyfriend had the steak and I had the salmon. The salmon was good, although I would of preferred there to me more of the sauce. The portion size for their plates to be big - very generous portion sizes, this includes their deserts. For desert, I had the creme brulee and my boyfriend had the chocolate torte. Both deserts were very good! As it was my birthday, the server came out with a really nice birthday plate for with the desert and the restaurant gave us two glasses of desert sparkling wine. Also, the General Manager came by to say hello and happy birthday to me.   I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! Good food and great service."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was both our first time. The restaurant is a lot smaller than anticipated but is nicely decorated and has a relaxed and kind of romantic vibe to it with chandeliers and dim lighting.   The service was great! Our waiter (wish I got his name) was super attentive and friendly and even brought out a complimentary birthday dessert which was so appreciated.  To eat I got the crusted basa which came with mashed potatoes and a side of veggies. My boyfriend got the 40 oz New York steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. I enjoyed my meal but wish that the portion of veggies was bigger. The basa was crunchy on the outside yet tender on the inside...yum! My boyfriend is a picky eater but really enjoyed his steak (I'd hope so for the price of it). He got his steak prepared medium well and it was cooked-- tender, juicy, and flavourful.   I also had two glasses of the white sangria so needless to say I really enjoyed that. I probably would've gotten a third glass if I wasn't stuffed lol.  Dessert also tasted great! Upon recommendation I got the creme brûlée and it was so good! I like that it wasn't overly sweet like a bunch of the other creme brûlées I've tasted. My boyfriend got the Tahitian ice cream which he found very tasty.   Overall the food and service was great but due to the price this wouldn't be a regular place I'd choose to dine at."}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious last Sunday. The ambience and the food was outstanding!!! The steak was fantabulous... made it to perfection!! The appetizer and dessert was amazing too!! The service was impeccable... Make sure you get Simon - he provided a very kind and friendly service. Will definitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious for a three-course dinner. Service was good. Chose octopus as a starter, beef filet for the main and cheesecake for desert. Disappointed that the octopus didn't seem to be cooked properly at all and was therefore very tough and almost impossible to chew. I've had octopus elsewhere that was properly cooked and very tender and even made my own at home that turned out better than this. Could barely cut through it and my fork kept getting stuck in the rubber.  Strangely served with black eyed beans, corn and way too much of this lemony vinegary flavor which didn't go well with the octopus in my opinion. The filet mignon was also sort of tough and not well seasoned.  Tried the garlic butter shrimp starter and that was excellent. Nice artwork on the walls. Will probably not go there again."}
{"text":"Came here on groupon deal, but was going to come here during summerlicious.   Food was awesome! Ordered: escargot (a bit too oily for me), shrimp cocktail which was really good!   Mains: baby back ribs and fries steak and garlic mash Both were very good  Dessert: creme brulee caramel cheesecake Soooo goood!  I think the customer service of the staff there really made our experience so much better! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon and meal was good.  All dishes we tried were tasty although I think it is best to stick with meats. I had the fish dish which was a bit salty and the wasabi potatoes not edible (note to chef-keep it simple and stick to basic mashed potatoes ). Service good, ambience nice for a date. I  will probably be back again."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem by complete accident with a group of friends just looking for somewhere to simply allow us to bring in our own bottle of wine. They charged a standard $25 corkage few so we were more than happy to dine there for the evening. The restaurant alone is beautiful, elegant and displays a wonderful \"fine dining\" ambiance. The wine list was very extensive and I was slightly glad we had brought our own bottle because I would have taken an hour just to decide on a bottle.  The sommelier was great as well as the server. It was a little pricey for what I saw on the menu, but I guess that's what u get for this area on Younge Street. However they did have an awesome lobsterfest special on for $45. That was exactly what I got.   I had a Caesar salad to start, which was huge, and had a nice twist on the dressing (Not such a heavy cream but more of an oil and vinegar base), and it was delicious. For my main I had a half lobster with a fillet mignon, mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. Everything was flavourful and cooked perfectly!  Just when I thought it was over, I was reminded that the special came with dessert. I somehow fit a chocolate cheesecake into my stomach after that!   The only reason this is not 5 stars was because it took an hour and twenty minutes for our food to come to the table. It was a Thursday night at 9:00 and not even busy so there was no excuse for that. Our server was apologetic though and once we settled up he informed us it was his first night... Good for him! He was fantastic.    I can gladly say all 6 of us from the group had a bad evening turn amazing after we found Wildfire, and cannot wait for another night out there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice once for winterlicious and once for regular service. For winterlicious this place is definitely worth the $45 cause instead of giving you small portions they give you some amazing portions. I had steak and lamb rack for winterlicious and i remember it being perfect but the service was lacking as we had to wave down the waitress and that was quite challenging. The second time being back I ordered a calamari to share but when it came obviously it wasn't meant to be shared AT ALL and we found it slightly undercooked not that its a problem. For the main course I ordered the 16oz ribeye, it was super juicy but I felt like they either put too much salt or the sauce was too salty. We also got the surf and turf which he really enjoyed this time and the lobster tail was cooked almost to perfection. The waiter we had this time was a nice man who gave us perfect amount of attention.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND GOING DURING WINTERLICIOUS."}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon voucher and took my friend who came for a visit from France. It was late and we were hungry, we did not come with a high expectation but we walked out with a full of satisction. Great service, delicious food, good wine. Totally worth it and I am coming back."}
{"text":"We recently went with some relatives (4 of us). They are regulars, and by way of introduction they said they had been 'burned' the last 3 times they went there. This was to be a make or break for them.  The wait staff was gloriously disinterested in us. We could have martians and we would have gotten more attention. It took awhile to get drinks, and a fair bit of time to have our orders taken.  I expected much, based on the price point and location. I reasoned that if they had been in business a long time they would know how to carry this out. But, as my wife sometimes tells me, I was wrong. Not much went according to a smooth 'dining experience'.  Food was ordered and a fairly long wait ensued. I always order my steaks medium rare pittsburgh style. That, somehow, was screwed up, and rather than return a medium steak I ate to be convivial. One of the dinner ordered salmon. In these days of uniform, farm grown salmon, how can you screw that up? But this restaurant did.  The only thing that arrived as expected were drinks and a bit of wine. Our waiter was sweating profusely, and even asked me why I had mentioned the steak if I did not intend to return it? I explained that we all wanted to dine together, and that would not have allowed me to do so. He then said \"I see no problem with the steak\"....I was tempted to say \"You should have eaten it then....\"....but again, I kept the waters calm.  The relationship between quality and price is totally lacking here. The prices are high, and the quality and service are low. There are much better steak dining options in Toronto, particularly my recent favorite, the Keg which I reviewed.  In carrying out the review of a business in France in 1983, I asked the owner why he felt so little impetus to give good customer service. He simply answered that there were enough suckers in the greater metropolitan area of Paris to provide with a ready supply of new customer. These guys must belong to the same school of thought.  Not a place I will return to!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice and relaxing. Good ambience, very attentive staff and the food was excellent quality!"}
{"text":"Located in a very nice part of Toronto, so we expected the quality of the steaks to reflect the type of clientele that live in the area. The steak was sub par at best. We ordered it Medium, and they brought it out \"blue\" which is rare with a quick sear on all sides. We obviously sent it back. They cooked it to medium but it was very tough to eat. More like a sirloin than a $30 filet.   The spinach/cheese dip we ordered as an appetizer was delectable. In fact, so good, we added it to the filet and it really made a difference with the flavor. Highly recommend that! And the veggies were delicious. We got carmelized Brussels sprouts with grilled vegetables. Very tasty!   The service was prompt, and they even gave us a free dessert because of the error with the steak. And they decorated the dessert plate with \"happy birthday\" and a sparkler in the middle of the cheesecake.   Last, they ended the evening with a very thoughtful birthday card. We have never seen a restaurant do that before. This, along with the rest of the service from the staff, is really what saved our experience."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on my birthday and I must say, it's a hidden gem. Loved the food, service and ambiance"}
{"text":"The only good thing about our experience was our waitress who was polite and tried hard.  The manager/host was lacklustre, low energy, and when we did tell him later about our issue, dismissed us and didn't try to remedy the situation (see end).   First: They didn't have the tomahawk steak which featured prominently on the menu. So we ordered other steaks. They were bitterly charred on the outside and though both were ordered medium rare, they were cooked differently (slightly over, slightly under). I expect more from a steakhouse.   Then: The \"grilled romaine\" Caesar salad was flaccid. And since both of us wound up horribly sick all evening starting immediately after dinner, we cannot help but assume that something we ate gave us the runs. Badly. Missed half the show we were downtown to see.   We returned to the restaurant after the show to let the manager know we were sick, and he immediately denied that it could've been them, and basically dismissed us.   So we will not return, and I suggest you don't go either."}
{"text":"Came here for the Summerlicious event recently.  I found it puzzling when the waiters warned of how hot the food is when the dishes arrived, but only to find them all to be lukewarm.   Ordered:  APPS Shrimp martini - The tiger shrimps were fresh, big and succulent. Came in a zesty citrus-vodka infused cocktail sauce. It had a nice tang to it, but I didn't taste any hint of vodka.   Lobster bisque - Tasted no different than ones you can find at the supermarket. It was like treasure hunting for lobster meat. It was probably my imagination that I ate a couple of pieces. Maybe.  Grilled Calamari - Nice and tender. It had a smokey flavour from the grill. I prefer this over battered calamari.  ENTREE Nova Scotia Lobster  - It was steamed, but to the point where the lobster tasted dry. Disappointing result, even when dipped in warm butter.  NY Striploin - Cooked exactly as requested. Tender and juicy. One of the more popular orders around.   Wildfire Back Ribs - Definitely anticipating this to be good dish. It was good, but comparing to Baton Rouge ribs, I would have to pick the latter.   Though it was an overall average experience, I wouldn't come back to pay full price for the meal.  Note: Parking is a pain around this district. So you have to circle around a bit to find a space on Yonge street or in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent Filet Mignon, the vegetables were really good, the roasted potatoes were excellent. My waiter was a great guy. Helpful and made sure the meal was just how my picky-ness likes. The drinks were great too and the place was nice and clean. The layout was beautiful. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My visit started off with bad service from the hostess team. I made reservations and it was at an early time. We literally saw 4 empty booths right in front of us (me and the GF) but they told us we had to sit at a small table. They told us that these booths were all reserved... but when we asked the floor manager if we could take the booth she said yes.  The food was great. I can't deny that! Our server ended up making our night a lot better. If it wasn't for him I would be giving this place 2 stars.   The steak was done a perfect medium and the wine selection was great. The creme brûlée was amazing.  Overall:  Server: great Food: excellent  Hostess: needs improvement"}
{"text":"I was in a group of 20 people.  Servers could barely remember who ordered what. Had to be reminded on food items still missing such as desserts. I ordered a drink that never came. Lamb was a waste of money as the portion was tiny and all bones and barely any roasted  potato. The Creme Brule was good but the Decident Belgium Torte dessert was tasteless and dry. I would not eat here again"}
{"text":"Wildfire Steakhouse & Wine Bar is neatly tucked within a side-road just off the busy Toronto finance core streets. Walking in the first thing I noticed were the aesthetics being sleek and classy. I knew I was in for a treat after reading mostly positive reviews.  My food consisted of filet mignon wrapped in bacon with side mashed potatoes. I took their sangria as a drink and I wrapped it all up with their cheesecake.   Nearly everything was fantastic! The filet mignon was just so tender and flavorful it just made my day. Mashed potatoes were delicious. The sangria was very good as well, albeit a little light. The cheesecake was wonderful and I hope they can re-consider bigger slices in the future, it's just too small.  Service was friendly and attentive. Great work here."}
{"text":"Came here with a 89$ groupon for two. Atmosphere was dark and the tables were way too close together. We had 4 people and were seated awkwardly on a big round table pushed on the wall. Just 30 cm behind me was another table and the waiter had to squish through to get to them.  Food was decent, we ordered the escargot which was a bit bland. The steak was decently cooked and the short rib was tender but had too much sauce. The best part was the thick and rich cheesecake and the chocolate torte dessert was also great.  Would not come here for the full price of the meal. I would say that the groupon price was a fair price, anything more, I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service was exceptionally slow and this was a Tuesday night--the place was not bursting at the seams by a long shot. The waiter was too much of a salesman--we told him we don't drink and he suggested their wine list was so good we should try it anyway. My husband's entree seemed to have been switched out for lack of ingredients; it was supposed to be a chipotle pasta dish. It tasted like beef stroganoff. My escargot was somewhat tasteless. The pecan tart was mealy and my creme brulee barely room temperature. Overall, they seem to be relying on a name and a flashy interior rather than attention to detail."}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious and mmmmmmm! So good! It is definately not my usual scene. The food on the regular menu is very pricey. I don't drink wine, but this place made me wish I did. Their wine list is bigger than their menu. I completely agree with the other review their hummus is delicious! I would have been happy with just that for dinner. The dessert was also fabulous. The ambiance is good. Low lighting. Great for a romantic dinner. The main part of the resturant was surprisingly loud, which was nice because it makes it feel more comfortable. There are some smaller rooms off of the main room which were more quiet. Our waiter was also very personable and friendly. He joked with us and had no problems giving his honest opinion on what to order. I wouldn't go back on an everyday thing because I couldn't afford it, but for a special occasion this is perfect. Also we got a $25 gift certificate when we left which is probably the nicest thing I have ever seen at a fancy resturant."}
{"text":"We went to Wildfire last night for dinner and we had a great time.  The staff were on the ball, attentive and clever. The food was great and there was plenty of it. I had a impeccably cooked medium rare steak and he had ribs that were so perfectly cooked you could have cut them with cooked spaghetti. One of the best wine lists I have ever seen.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and tried their winterlicious menu. It was quite busy on the first floor considering it was a weekday. We were brought up to the second floor where I assumed was where they try to gather all the winterlicious peeps.  The general interior of the restaurant was nice with a slight upscale vibe. Their huge glass wine rack near the entrance was what first drew my attention.   Now on to the food...  I ordered the escargot as an appetizer, the pan seared trout with vegetables as the main and the carrot cake as the dessert.  I went with friends who ordered the signature salad and calamari as appetizers and the NY steak for the main. The portions are decent and I guarantee you'll feel quite satisfied by the need of the meal (tip: wear loose/comfortable pants).  I was pleased with the the appetizers. Escargot tasted great and exactly what you would imagine by looking at it. I thought signature salad was most unique and quite refreshing.  The trout was cooked just right so no complaints. My favourite part was actually the braised red cabbage that was one of the sides for all the main dishes we ordered. The purple risotto that accompanied the trout was nothing too spectacular. The steak was cooked the way it was asked, again no complaints.  By the time dessert came, we were all pretty stuffed but you know what they say...there's always a second stomach for dessert. Unfortunately, I found the dessert to be way too sweet. I tried the carrot cake and the brownie cheesecake which was the sweetest out of the two. I heard that the other cheesecake on their menu was just as sweet. I wanted to brush my teeth right afterwards. If you have an extreme sweet tooth then maybe you'll enjoy it. I was surprised that they didn't have other options like creme brûlée  For the price ($44) it was worth it. If you're looking for a steakhouse and happen to be in the area, you could come and check it out."}
{"text":"We came here for a date night using the groupon prefix dinner for two. The service is great and I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Staff are really friendly and knowledgeable. I believe we had Eleanor?? She was really fantastic! Food is great and so are the portions! The groupon includes wine or beer, but they were happy to substitute non alcoholic drinks for us.  For food, we had the calamari fritti and the beef carpaccio to start. The calamari was great! The beef carpaccio was amazing!! I cannot resist a good beef carpaccio :) it was light, thinly sliced, and they have the shaved parmesan over top and citrus-y arugala  salad to go with.   For mains we had the ribs and the pork tenderloin. My tenderloin was a bit dry but the flavors were amazing, especially with that Apple chutney. Even the sides are done well with each their own flavors, hence why I'm giving this place the five stars. Food isn't always perfect but when the effort to attention is there, it makes a difference.   Lastly for dessert, we ordered the cheesecake and creme brulé. Their desserts are amazing!!! Cheesecake is creamy without being too heavy. Creme brulé is house made and it's so light and delicious!! Desserts were not overly sweet and therefore a great way to end a wonderful meal!   This is definitely a place to go for a special date night :) keep your expectations down and just enjoy every meal placed in front!"}
{"text":"Great food and the best service I'v ever experienced in Toronto! I highly recommend this place, particularly for special occasions! The bar-restaurant is a bit small, but definitely cozy with good light and nice decoration! My husband took me there for my birthday. We had the Groupon deal for four-course dinner for two. Every single bite we had tasted great! I'm not exaggerating! The food was perfect! Our starters, soup of the day and calamari fritti were so delicious. For main, I had steak, medium well, which was both juicy and well-cooked and seasoned, and the mashed potato which came with it was just flawless! My husband and I both agreed it was one of the best mashed potatoes we've ever had! His meal, veal chop was so good too, in good portion and perfectly cooked and flavoured!  Our deserts came with a sparkler and a happy-birthday wish written on the plate! It was so sweet!! The carrot cake was absolutely moist and yummy, and brulee was creamy with well-balanced aroma and flavour of vanilla!  The very nice lady who served us was so helpful, friendly, and fast. She made very good recommendations on what we could choose and was very attentive about my husband's allergies. As I said in the beginning, this place doubtlessly offers one of the best services you can get in Toronto's restaurants! We will definitely return there!"}
{"text":"As we were driving around, we decided to try somewhere new for dinner and we randomly chosen this place. It was very quiet and only had some noisy drunks in the restaurant who were very loud, it made the restaurant lose the relaxing cozy feel it had when we first walked in..  I found the service for how quiet the place was to be very slow, there were lots of wait staff running around like chickens with their heads cut off but nobody seemed to be actually doing anything productive.  I expected much more from the look of the restaurant to what they had to offer and from the presentation of the restaurant, staff and prices that I should of  been better service.  I ordered the 8oz filet mignon, medium-well which came with mashed potatoes  and some veggies as sides.  I found that the steak was more on the rare side, not how I like it but it was already cooked to death it seemed that I didn't want them throwing it back on the grill to make it into a hockey puck. it wasn't bad, just wasn't as good as it could of been.  Supposedly they have the best ribs in the area as the menu listed but tonight that was proven wrong. He ordered the ribs and as soon as he saw them arrive, looked very disappointed. only after only a little taste, he says \"these are the worse ribs I have ever had in my entire life\"  he ended up sending them back and getting the steak just as me.  The restaurant was sort of a disappointment overall and we will probably never return."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, and had a wonderful time. Firstly the atmosphere was very romantic and calming, it was crazy busy either (Which I liked). We were seating in a nice spot nestled in a corner, it was a candle lit area, with beautiful wood furniture (chairs and table). The food was really good just as well. I got the Filet Mignon, and she had the Steak Rib eye. Both were cooked fabulously, were very tender and tasty! Can't forget about the appetizer, we tried the polenta fries, with parmesan on top, they were scrumptious to say the least, yum!  Finally, for dessert we shared this ice cream dish, cant remember the name exactly but it was delicious, no complaints there either...And throughout diner we enjoy a couple drinks, she had a spanish coffee, and myself some premium beer :D.  Great place to check out for a date night especially, keep in mind its a tad pricey, but well worth it!  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Oh where to begin. We went with a Groupon voucher. Promptly seated in the worst table in the restaurant. We were moved to a nice table and after about a 20 minute wait the waiter approached  us... we shared that we were on a gluten free diet. He took our order.. all 4 courses and left. Again about 20 minutes went by and he dropped a loaf of bread off at our table. Mentioned he had forgotten our wine and dashed off. When he returned i asked if the bread was gluten free. He apologized. The H'orderves arrived and they were good. He took away the board then were served on however left our used cutlery and side plates. After about 45 minutes our main courses arrived. We explained that we had not had our apps yet.. (see a pattern) The waiter did not come over to apologize. He just dropped the apps. This was the part that caused us to smile the most... I asked about cutlery and he started to take a fork off of our used side plate. In the end we paid with the waiter bringing the cc machine to our table. It jammed and he opened it spilling the paper everywhere.   For a high end steakhouse the food was just ok.. the service was horrid. Be warned. We have had some amazing experiences with Groupon.. and a few like this. This experience wants me to stay home and hibernate."}
{"text":"Really bad service . First we had a reservation and we still had to wait as they were having a \" turn over of clients\" whatever that means. Next they took 20 minutes just to take the order . The body language of all the staff was like we don't really want to work here. They could not find salt and pepper, strange as it's a restaurant . Having said that food was very good, steak and calamari was really good. Would I go here , for the food yes but for the service probably not."}
{"text":"This is a very nice dinner option if you're looking to dine north of Lawrence. However, the prices are definitely 'south of Lawrence' :)  Recommended dishes: -Escargot -Back ribs with BBQ sauce -Wild mushroom risotto -fish special (arctic char) was also excellent  Not recommended: -caesar salad"}
{"text":"I was here in Feb 5 for winterlicious for dinner. The food was great. The atmosphere here was good. It was a prefect dinner. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Well we try it again everything we ordered was good except the steak. Steak were little over cook for medium rare but the steak itself was rough. There ribs, salmon was much better meal. Any restaurant call them a steak house should have the steak to be number best on the list. Since it's a good service and nice place to be, we will come again"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last Saturday for Summerlicious at 5pm..Steak was excellent with great service..My waiter was very attentive and even asked us how we liked our food for each course. Had the scallops, Strip loin steak, escargot, ribs and creme brulee. Seafood was ok but not as fresh as I liked it. So I would definitely recommend coming here mainly for the steak.  Creme Brulee was good and cheesecake was really good. I would order cheesecake & steak again next time I come here :)"}
{"text":"Our server, Ryan, was fantastic! Food was not up to par considering the money you pay Ambiance was nice, not too dark as others haw said Would I go back? No, I rather go across the street to burger priest anytime :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Toronto vacation because I heard that they grill their steaks with maple-flavored charcoal.  The pureed wild mushroom soup was hot, fresh and quite delicious, and my wife spoke fondly of the Canadian Riesling and mozzarella tomato salad which she had to start with.  The highlight of the evening for sure was the special: 6 oz. NY strip steak with the aforementioned maple flavor along with half a Nova Scotia lobster, accompanied by warmed garlic butter and smooth and creamy mashed potatoes with roasted vegetables.  The dessert I wanted wasn't available (strawberry rhubarb,) so I had a small but tasty cappuccino, and the waiter was kind enough to bring some chocolate bonbons for free.  The service was friendly and helpful but not very fast, and it took awhile to get the lobster-cracking tools that I needed to open the claws on the lobster.  It was a Saturday night and there was a large party in the other room so I understand, but even so for the price I would expect somewhat more attention.  Anyhow, excellent steak and seafood which is what I   came in for, odd decor (old-fashioned wood paneling along with multicolored dim lights at the booths) but friendly staff, the best meal I had in Toronto, costly but worth it"}
{"text":"Fantastic polenta fries, great atmosphere, solid service, though surprisingly empty for a Thursday at 8pm."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! From appetizers to dessert (creme brûlée best ever) this was a stellar diinner. And could not be more complementary of the very friendly and professional service. Thanks, Angela! Next time we visit Toronto we will return."}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's Eve. Please post your NYE menu on your website or OpenMenu for next year. It wasnt listed anywhere. Its a bit shady not knowing what your going in for until you arrive at the resto. Just my humble opinion.   OK on to the food. The scallop cheese soup was 5 star material! Delicious. Lobster bisque was a let down. Tiny morsels of lobster and a boring broth equal PASS. The new york steaks were well cooked. Not well done like how I wanted it but still really good. 5 star steak here. The portion size was good but I wouldnt say generous. Especially in terms of the sides. It was pretty small.   Desserts were spot on. Good way to end any meal. Creme brulee stole the show. So eggy and creamy. Just how I like it. Overall, I gotta take .5 stars off for not announcing the NYE menu for everyone to know in advance. Honestly, I should take more stars off for that. .5 stars off for the lobster bisque. 4 stars  (OH SERVICE WAS GOOD! HAD AN AWESOME FEMALE SERVER :D)"}
{"text":"We went to Wildfire Steakhouse for Winterlicious (lunch).   THE \"GOOD\"  - the service was very good, from the hostess to the waiter. - the appetizer, the escargot was delicious; it came with warm bread, perfect for dipping into garlic butter. - the dessert, red velvet sponge cake with cream cheese icing and the chocolate flourless cake were both good.   THE \"BAD\"  - the main course was not a steak sandwich -- on baguette, one slice of the thinnest beef imaginable, it was a joke asking us how we wanted it cooked - really!!!??  This was without a doubt the WORST steak sandwich I have ever had; I have had roast beef that was thicker. Even sandwiches at a deli or steak sandwich at a pub that was far better.  I would hope that the burger ws better and even the lobster I saw someone else having looked better. - they stuck us in a back room right by a door where the staff go back and forth to the kitchen and where in the winter, the kitchen staff during on a fan, talk about drafty!! We spoke to them about it and they turned off the fan - but then they turned it on again midway through the meal.  To the restaurant -- this is your chance to get regular customers.  This was so bad, that we won't be back.  Really!  at a steakhouse?  Come on people.  So - where's the beef -- I mean literally!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is lovely. It's a classy joint and the food reflects the mood.  There isn't a whole lot of seating here so make a reservation for sure.   The food is amazing, you need to try the crab cakes if you come here!! Best I've ever had by far. I had the lobster tail for dinner and the creme brule for dessert, both were delicious and portioned perfectly.   If you come in for a special event make sure you let them know! I got free champagne and a birthday card from the staff which was so comforting.   Thanks Wildfire!"}
{"text":"I heard alot about this place...apparently it was rated top steakhouse by toronto.com users...not sure what they were thinking when they voted it...lets go through the list:  Ambiance: Excellent - great date place and very romantic setting  Service: Subpar - for such an expensive place you would think that the service would be better, unfortunately our waiter seemed more interested in doing nothing rather than serving us...we even asked him how the filet mignon was..his response - tender, and he walked away...I can read that it is tender from the menu, but thanks for coming out...  Food: Mediocre at best - Again, for the price I would have assumed that the steak would have been far better than it was...I ordered the New York Striploin and it was overcooked and filled with fat...looked great, but tasted like a disaster!  My date ordered Filet mignon - dry, overcooked and tough to eat...tender?  Not really...  The last straw was when I presented the waiter with a $25 gift certificate...it was supposed to be taken off of the bill BEFORE taxes, but our genius waiter took it off AFTER taxes, leaving himself with a nice hefty tip...  Overall: POOR  Would I recommend it? If you want to hang out in a nice restaurant? Sure...if you want to eat something? Definitely not"}
{"text":"I recently was organizing a large group dinner for a celebration (14 people). The criteria we had to meet were: Steakhouse (check), vegan and vegetarian friendly (check), and willing to work with me to swing a little last minute party (absolutely check!).  Rock, the manager, was an all star. He worked with me to make it an awesome evening. He was incredibly accommodating to our requests, gave me plenty of options, and just overall a really pleasant person to deal with (competence and personality!).   The menu was delicious, everyone was super happy with the menu offerings, and for the vegan they worked with her to make sure she had enough actual food to eat (compared to another Toronto steakhouse who said \"maybe we can steam some vegetables for her, or give her a plain potato\"). We also thoroughly enjoyed the wine list (how can you eat steak without a glass of red wine in hand?).  Finally, our waiter Matteo was unbelievably attentive and knowledgable. Thank you so much for making our evening fantastic!  Overall it was a great dining experience. I would strongly recommend Wildfire, especially for large groups."}
{"text":"So you call to make a reservation and the hostess pulls up your phone number and addresses you by your name. She knows you've been there before and accepts the reservation. Then she asks \"is it a special occasion?\", to which I answer \"yes, it's my girlfriend's birthday\". And she goes further to ask her name, which I provide, spelling it out twice (and it's only a few letters in the name). And you think, wow, they really care. This is great.   Then you arrive at a restaurant which you reviewed before, giving it high marks for food but wishing it wasn't during \"hurry up and eat so we can turn the table Winterlicious\". And after being seated at a four top of our request, you make nice conversation for 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes before you hail down a person who just listens to your plea for a drink and walks away. Another 5 mins and a waiter appears and apologizes and starts giving \"free water\" for the wait.   Wildfire, as I have said before, has a nice ambiance, good food and comfortable seating, but the personalized service is lacking and that's the reason for only 3 stars. Yes, all these things are important but service makes or breaks the experience and as you can also imagine, not one word was said or done about the \"birthday special occasion\", and I wasn't about to make that sly walk to the washroom to tell the waiter.   Great marks for the attempt at recognizing the special event but extremely poor marks for execution. What do they say? Once burned, twice shy? Three times? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Came here last night for valentine's day - had reservations but were told to wait another half hour for our table, even though there were many empty tables all around the restaurant. We waited at the bar, and already, the restaurant didn't have a good look to it. There were empty glasses all over the bar counter with like 5 staff members crammed in the corner scrambling, their lights were flickering too... Once we were finally sat, every empty table around us still had glasses and plates on them which was a huge turn-off. You'd expect from a high-end restaurant that they would at least bus their tables. There was a huge piece of gum under my table that kept sticking to my leg.. had to use one of their table napkins to clean it myself. Anyways, our server was ok, barely checked up on us, didn't even say happy valentines day, but that's whatever. Food was ok too. Calamari was bland and oily. Steaks were amazing, however I asked for a medium cook and got medium-rare. Sides were nothing special. Garlic mash didn't even have a garlic taste; wasn't even properly mashed... not smooth as there were chunks of potato. Most likely won't be returning, probably should of just gone to the keg."}
{"text":"Tried here after purchasing a deal from groupon. The atmosphere was decent. Wait staff seemed short in my section since I felt everything took a long time from drinks to getting the bill the only thing that was fast was how fast our server was talking. Otherwise, food was okay. Overall, wouldn't come again if I were to pay full price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner to celebrate an anniversary. We had a groupon deal, it was both our first times so neither of us knew what to expect.  We had a 4 course meal, plus free wine (you can choose beer if you like) and it was fantastic. The hors d'oeuvres were amazing. I got the Caesar salad which was delicious and he got the calamari. I wasn't a huge fan but he loved it. Our entrees were some of the best restaurant food I've ever had. I got the chicken and absolutley loved it! He got the steak and was tender and juicy. Desert was quite good as well, as the chef even took the time to write happy anniversary on our plate. Food was immaculate.  Service was even better. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, sweet, kind, and overall just very good at her job. The manager came by a few times and he was great too. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is a little hard to find, but definite worth the search.  10/10 for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered through UberEATS, I paid 30$ for a salad and grilled chicken and as I was eating my chicken I noticed there was a BUG in between the spices. I felt sick to my stomach and I automatically stopped eating! I will never order from this restaurant again and will not recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to this steakhouse a couple of times. The steaks there are pretty good (although it always seems like the people who I go with's steak's are better prepared than mine :( ) But the service is ass.  I went there most recently on mother's day and they didn't even bring us water or bread. we had to ask for both. and my steak was meh this time. And the crowd is all over-the-hill cougars and nasty dudes on the prowl for them - along with families.  honestly, compared to this place, just go to the keg. steaks are almost on par and cheaper at the keg. At least the service there will be good.  One other thing. I think this is the chain from the states. I first ate at their main location in Chicago and it was great. Much better than here. But that was a christmas party, and we were big spenders."}
{"text":"After booking a reso here via open table, I looked deeper into the reviews and saw a few write ups on their pre fixe menu (purchased via Groupon) I called to see as a first time guest if the host Maxwell would recommend (I find Groupons / pre fixe menus to be hit or miss.) Decided to take advantage of the 4 course Groupon with wine for 2 people just $93 (+ tax $12 and tipped $40) Portions were generous and available options to suit all palates.  To start beef tenderloin skewers, shrimp skewers and polenta fries. Apps we opted for the beef carpaccio and grilled calamari, both good. Mains we both ordered the 10oz striploin which was cooked to perfection- honestly one of the best steaks I've had, along with the garlic mash and roasted veggies that were also cooked to perfection. Desserts we tried the creme brûlée and cheesecake - both delicious and despite being full, there was still room to 'lick our plates clean' for those delicacies. As a special treat they surprised us with a glass of champagne each (not included in groupon)  Service was exceptional, friendly and welcomed us back. Also spoke about an upcoming promotion.  This place needs to be acknowledged as a top steakhouse in the city, groupon or not we will be coming back and HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with the family to enjoy a special meal. We were you mediately seated Hasbro reservations by the lovely hosts.  Our waiter took our wine and drink order. He was very accommodating and helpful with the wine selection.  Our dinner included several options off the menu including, steak, salmon, lamb, pasta and Caesar salad.  The Caesar was nicely done in a unique way with the Romaine cut half and slightly charred over the grill.  The steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The salmon was nicely done but lacked some of the presentation like the other dishes that were presented. The lamb looked amazing unfortunately the dish was not a winner.   Overall we had an excellent dinner and the service was very good considering how busy the place was buzzing. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very fancy restaurant for a night meal. I'd come for a family occasion or date. The service was good and the food even better. I came for summerlicious and it did not disappoint. I'd definitely come back again if I had the cash and a reason to celebrate something :)"}
{"text":"*The restaurant itself is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel and the entrance on Colborne street was super easy to be missed/  *Although it was still bright outside, the restaurant was dimly lighted which resulted into very bad quality pictures lol... *Upon arriving, we were given the Groupon menu and were told that we could select one of the 4 types of either wine or beer which were included on the Groupon menu. *the service here was amazing and the servers constantly refilled my water and always made sure we were okay with our food. *The normal price is already quite steep, with that said I thought the $90 groupon was still expensive considered the quality of food here. Don't get me wrong, it's a good deal but I believe you can pay a bit more and receive better food in restaurants around the area.  -Hors D'oeuvres: The Hors D'oeuvres were freshly made and changed daily based on what's in season. It came with:  --Polenta fries: though not as good as the ones I had at Richmond Station, it still had a nice crust, soft and creamy on the inside. --Pulled pork with salsa: dry and bland --Vegetarian spring rolls: really good! The sauce added a nice kick and it was crunchy. --Smoke salmon with shrimps: I could barely tasted the smoke salmon, the shrimps were cooked well and it was topped with mayonnaise (I think).  -Escargots Provencal (herbed butter, roasted garlic shallots, panko topping) For appetizer I got the escargots and while they were soft and tender, I thought the dish was too oily but had a really strong buttery taste (in a good way!). The panko topping added some crunches with every bite and the sauce wasn't too garlicky, overall a well-made appetizer.  -P.E.I Mussels (steamed in a spicy tomato sauce or garlic cream sauce) it would have been nice if some bread was served on the side to soak up all that delicious broth! These were decent sized mussels with no empty shells, so that means the mussels did not have any muscles to escape... get it?  Anyhow the cream sauce was incredibly flavorful and had just enough kick to it, and if it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the bowl clean.  -Wildfire back ribs with grilled shrimps (house cut fries, seasonal vegetables) While the ribs were nice and tender, it wasn't the fall-off-the-bone type and was a bit bland. I devoured the grilled shrimps since they were probably the best part of the dish as the fries were a bit limp...  -10oz New York strip loin (garlic mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables) The steak had a perfect medium-rare temperature but it was under-seasoned. The mashed potatoes was too salty and had no garlic taste to it. The steak came with some  well-cooked broccoli, roasted red pepper and zucchini.  -Decadent Chocolate torte (house made flourless Belgian chocolate torte) The texture of chocolate torte was similar to a brownie, it was rich but somehow still remained light. Though it was too sweet for my taste, I appreciated how they used dark chocolate instead and if there was more raspberry sauce to cut down the sweetness, it would have been perfect!  -Wildfire Creme Brule (vanilla custard made with Madagascar vanilla beans) The creme brule had a nice sugar coating on top and the custard had a nice texture, yet it suffered the same problem as the previous dessert - overly sweetened."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a PERFECT dining experience. I was worried about the seats, so I reserved one in advance. But when I got there, it seems I didn't need to do that.lol The steak is quite delicious, I love them in rare. The wine I randomly ordered was good as well. The only thing I am not a fan for was the soup. It was weirdly sweet and too gingery.  The server were all very friendly"}
{"text":"Reservation was easy to make through open table for same day. Arrived a few minutes early for the reservation to be greeted like a King as my date and I were the only diners. First thing that I love about this place is the woody smell. Atmosphere was romantic. Had a wonderful 4-course with wine. Food wasn't anything spectacular. Steak may have been a bit under seasoned, but cooked exactly to requests. Carrot cake dessert was great. What won me over with this restaurant was the service. Water was constantly filled and was asked in the middle of each course if food was enjoyable. Great service but food was just okay."}
{"text":"I was here last night on a Groupon with a friend of mine.  It was an awesome deal and we definitely go out a good value for what we paid. On a freezing night we started with their Green Lentil soup and had mains which were great off that Groupon Menu.  I found our mains a bit salty but great quality and cooked perfectly. Our server was knowledgeable and the rest of the staff were nice a friendly as well welcoming someone frozen stiff from how cold it has been recently in Toronto.  We paired our mains with a Cab that came with our deal. It wasn't my favorite but I see how it paired nicely with the meal.  The only two complaints I have was that service was slow and that the booth we were in was cramped and tiny. Granted I'm 6'4'' so most things are cramped for me, but this was noticeably small for myself.  Would I go here again? Of course. However, there are better steakhouses in Toronto. Given how close it is to my place in relation to better locations, Wildfire gets a better rating.  They've got Winterlicious Coming up so I'd slip in if they've got something good going on."}
{"text":"There is a review a few reviews back that says this place is better than the Keg, i disagree. I would say better than Milestones, but not the Keg or Canyon Creek.  I have been here a few times, always on a \"licious\" event. I booked through Open Table, and was seated in a great booth right away. Very comfortable setting.  Our server, although good and attentive, was very slow. The restaurant wasn't tooooo busy, but he seemed to struggle to keep up. About 10 minutes to get my iced tea.  For Summerlicious, the menu is fantastic, 5 choices for each course is outstanding. My date had the striploin, which she enjoyed, but had the same complaint about the potatoes as Tina H. (tasted old). I had the rib steak, which was tasty, but very undercooked. I asked for between medium/medium well, got rare. I don't mind rare, and if i get it, I'll eat it, just a bit disappointed. The veggies were OK, the peppers were a bit overcooked though.  I would definitely give this place a shot if in north Toronto, but you may be slightly disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance on a friday night, they have live jazz too. a nice standard steak house dinner -  had the 8 oz. new york strip cooked rare. standard mash potatoes and some veggies as sides. the extra spinach and mushroom side dishes we ordered were ok. the escargo app was ok, standard. the humus that came with the bread was FaBulous. so yummy that i ate more bread than i usually do. (definitely a highlight of the night) Amazing wine list - i asked our waiter to pair it with our dinner selections and he picked GOOD ones :) i had a fabulous souv blanc, and my friend had a yummy shiraz  it's a nice no fuss steakhouse place for a lil nicer than a casual night out. (1 app, 2 steaks, plus wine, no dessert) ~$150 w/ tip for 2 ppl."}
{"text":"Pretty decent but not the greatest. Tried it for Summerlicious. Nice fat curly black hair in my friend's caesar salad, which, before the hair, was ok. The steak was disappointing for a steakhouse. I asked for medium rare and it came out medium. If you have the word \"steak\" in your name, you should at least know how to cook a steak medium rare.   Ribs were delicious. Mashed potatoes tasted old. Service was pretty decent. So many people running around filling water, it was insane, but mains took a long time to come out, and the waiter forgot something.   Dessert was good. Decent choice for Summerlicious but I wouldn't pay full price for it. Worth a try for Summerlicious or Winterlicious."}
{"text":"From the photos on their website was surprised at how small it was, but luckily it was not too busy on a Tuesday night. The servers were very solicitous and friendly. The calamari app was the best I've ever had! Large rings cooked perfectly with a tasty crunchy coating. My son had the blue cheese topped filet, which was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. Meat was tender and had good flavor. My husband and I both ordered the strip cooked medium, which should be pink inside; unfortunately both were overcooked so we had to send them back. But they were cooked perfectly when they came back, and were delicious! The sides of spinach and asparagus were good, as was the French onion soup and the charred Caesar salad. And our waiter comp'd our shared creme brûlée dessert to make up for the steak issue--very nice! Definitely recommend for a nice steak dinner!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food and rude front of house staff. Felt extremely unwelcome and uncomfortable during a friend's reserved table on their birthday. Will not be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"I made last min reservations and was able.to get the time I wanted plus they asked me if it was a special occasion which it was! I said it was my bfs birthday and they said they will bring out something nice for him which I thought was so nice!  We got there an hour late for our reservation so I understand what I'm about to comment on might be my own fault but wildfire has a beautiful seating area at the back with candles and soft light. When we arrived they seated is opposite the bar..essentially a narrow hallway for ppl to basically use to walk to the back. I would have appreciated them asking us if we wanted to sit at the back cuz when I looked it was half empty and they were fully serving the people still sitting there..so that's the only negative thing that got me.  The food was awesomee. We got crab cakes (comes with 2 big ones) they were crispy and hot and so yummy. We both got the new York striploin. Mine medium and his Chicago style. Amazing.   The drinks were ok..Mine was a gin and tonic but I found it a bit weak. My bfs martini was a bit weak too.  So I'm getting ready to pay AND NEXT THING I KNOW THEY BRING OUT A SPARKLER IN A CREME BRULEE. I had totally forgotten about his bday surprise! They were nice and quiet about it too which I loved.  Will come back and am determined to sit in the candlelit area!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and I was very impressed by how professional our server was and how delicious the food tasted despite the restaurant being extremely busy and packed.   We booked for 8:45pm (super late I know...all other times were booked!!) and was told we could arrive at 8:30pm since our table should be ready by then. It was not ready, but after waiting for 10 minutes, a young server brought over spring rolls for my party of 12 and apologized for the long wait. Our table was ready at 8:50pm (so it wasn't too much later after our scheduled time).  We got our own private room and it was great because the room was very sound proof.   I ordered escargot for an appetizer, New York Striploin with a blue cheese butter for the main, and creme brûlée for dessert (as I'm sure MOST did). The food was GREAT! The escargot was deliciously buttery with a hint of Parmesan, my steak (though a little more cooked than I'd like) was very flavourful and seasoned excellently (the blue cheese butter added a nice flavour too) and the mashed potatoes accompanying it was well made. The creme brûlée was CRAZY smooth and just enough eggy creamy taste to it. It was such a great meal. Everything I ordered completely satisfied my cravings.  What made it extra awesome was the server. Although we were in a private room he always came by periodically to check up on our experience and to refill our drinks. As I mentioned, I'm sure everyone ordered the creme brûlée because some of my guests did not receive their's as the restaurant ran out. Instead of asking them to choose another from the winterlicious menu, they gave my guests the full dessert menu and to choose from any one. They got apple pie instead :P As another yelper mentioned, they also mixed up some of the orders for my group of 12. It wasn't too big of a deal for me.   It was a fantastic and satisfactory meal and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"2 guests for a 6:30 summerlicious reservation. Arrived at 6:11 and were seated a table (yay!). First impression: CANNOT SEE! It's so stupidly dark, I honestly couldn't see for a good while. Good customer service at the front and a nice young lady held the door open for us and didn't mind that I accidentally stepped on her poor foot (sorry). Our waiter was nice, suggested a wine for us and although there were two small errors he was good about correcting them without attitude.  Starters: Grilled Calamari - The flavours didn't really go with the rest of my meal and wasn't as exciting as I was expecting. The calamari didn't taste like anything and was really too chewy. Should have just gone for the Caeser salad or shrimp, which looked really juicy and plentiful as they passed my table.  Caprese Salad - Awkward. The reduction was too strong for the salad to be doused in it, the basil was mixed with some spring mix and instead of just one sort of tomato we got tomato wedges and cut cherry tomatoes. The boccocini was really good though.  Main: Surf and Turf -  It was okay. I think the dish wasn't as good because of the lighting in the restaurant. I know that sounds weird but I just couldn't see what I was eating. The colours looked dull and boring. A few crisp string beans, baby carrots and bokchoy. A little mashed potato. A steak done exactly the way I wanted it to be...but also a little salty. And the delicious lobster. I just couldn't enjoy it in the dark though. Good portions though!  Dessert: Cheesecake - one of the best I've tasted! My friend wouldn't let me eat any of hers, save one half forkful.  Pecan and Chocolate tart - it was a little disappointing that the pecan were chopped but it was delicious. Buttery, smooth, not too sweet and warm. A little more could have been done for the crust as it wasn't as flaky as I like.   Final verdict? I wouldn't come back here for their normal priced fare. Probably wouldn't come back here for either of the -licious' but it was a good learning experience, especially one that was pretty easy on the wallet (~$50 for a dinner that kept me full from 8-1am)."}
{"text":"I tried Wildfire steakhouse a couple weeks ago and was very impressed. I had bought a Groupon for two which included wine. The hotel itself is small and the entrance on Colborne street is super easy too miss, but I'm kinda glad that it's so hidden because it made for a quiet and relaxed environment.    First off the restaurant ambiance is beautiful, it's dim lighting and candle like is super romantic. The staff is extremely welcoming and just overall very pleasant. Since we had a Groupon, we were given the Groupon menu upon arrival and told that we could select one of the 4 types of either wine or beer which is included with our Groupon. So I chose red wine and my boyfriend picked a Portuguese beer that the hostess informed was imported straight to the restaurant and couldn't be found at the LCBO (wish I remembered the name). To start off our menus we were brought a plater of chef's appetizers (these are preselected). Basically it's a mixture of 4 small two-bite appetizers, which were all delicious. Next we had the Cesar salad and mussels in a spicy red tomato sauce. The mussels were absolutely amazing. The sauce was not I really spicy but had just enough kick in it, I was very pleased. For our entree both my boyfriend and I had steak and mashed potatoes. It was a phenomenal steak, cooked perfectly. We really had no complaints at all. For dessert we had cheese cake and creme brûlée. Since it was our anniversary the restaurant actually brought our dessert on a platter and two complimentary glasses on champagne!   Overall I really enjoyed both the food and the service at Wildfire Steakhouse and I can definitely see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were there for valentines day menu but it was nothing special. Options were mainstream although their steak was good. The wine selection is huge! Ask your sommelier to make a recommendation. Decor was nice enough, good spacing but the restrooms were downstairs I think. It's a nuisance when you have to go up or down stairs to get to them.  Would I return? Sure but maybe in a little while."}
{"text":"I was there a year ago and had a great dinner. However it seems to have fallen.    Bread was brought to the table with a small $ store type white container.  There was a chip on the container.  My GF pointed that out. The server took it away and returned a short time later with the same container stating that they were all chipped and were on order... This is a place that charges on average $140 for two.    It was about 33 C out so I. Chose the ceasar salad.  Upon delivery it was very wilted. They were laid out on a re rectangular plate with some dressing and croutons on top.  I tried it and the leaves tasted burned.  I may have missed it but it turns out they grill it.  Burnt lettuce on a hot day.    My gf had the ribs.  Last year they were excellent.  Now they were dried out and without much meat.  You had to scrape the tiny slivers of meat off the bone piece meal.   I had the steak.  This year it was quite salted,  and the quality of the cut would never make the grade at a standard Keg or even Costco.  It was prepared well enough in fairness.   On top of this, although the restaurant was near empty we were seated with our reservations directly beside the manager that was constantly ordering from suppliers,  taking party reservations,  etc at the bar a meter and a half from us.    The server was very nice.  She was very helpful. She wasn't trained for this type restaurant and their price point but no qualms about her service.   I would stay away until we start to hear better from them."}
{"text":"Came here for their winterlicious, mainly because that have a lot of different options for their appetizer as well as their main course.  I ordered the escargot for appetizer and the fillet mignon for main.  The escargot was kind of blend and definitely different from what I expected.  I ordered the fillet mignon for medium rare and for an actual steakhouse I expected to get my steak medium rare just like I ordered. However the steak came and it was more like medium if not well done. My friend who offered the same thing, was also the same.  The reason for the low score was because I found their customer service wasn't really on point. Our server never came and checked how we were doing, let alone asked if our steak were okay. It wasn't a busy night there when we went but we seem to have a hard time locating where our server was. When we finally found him and asked to get our meals packed (cause they were quite big in portion) he was quite reluctant to do so.  Quite disappointed at the service as well as the steak for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Here for winterlicious. The food was great (although my original order of a striploin sandwich was partially RAW when it was supposed to be a medium rare). Had an appeitizer an hour ago and now still waiting for the main course to come along. Also, not to forget to mention about taking the plates away 30 mins after we're done. The table next to us came after we've finished our appetizers; their main couses came at the same time as ours. Guessed they've ordered alcholic drinks and we didn't? Well, maybe their service and prices really DOES go hand-in-hand. (And we're STILL WAITING. No water btw.) Not going to recommend this place unless you are alright paying for a 3hr parking ticket outside when we've only expected 1.5 hr for lunch."}
{"text":"If you like a flavorful steak this is the place.  If you like your steak bland and unseasoned stick with the Keg."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here after purchasing the 4 course prixe-fixe menu for $90 from Groupon. The restaurant is cozy, in terms of limited seating space, but nicely decorated. The only thing giving it 3 stars is for the great service. I bought my partner here for his birthday and they hand written him a lovely card. They also gave a beautiful sparkler for the dessert dish. We very much appreciated that.   For appetizers, we ordered the caesar salad and grilled calamari. The caesar salad came as half a romaine lettuce. The presentation of the food here could be better I think. The portion size is also great big for an appetizer. The calamari was decent.   The main disappointment was the quality of the steak. We had much higher expectations since this is a steakhouse. However, the medium rare steak was dry and not flavourful (and too charred at one end). I ordered the ribs and it was better but still mediocore.   The dessert dish we ordered tasted like chocolate brownies? A little too sweet and over powering, it would be nice perhaps if they paired it with ice cream for balancing of flavours."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed in how bad the service and food has gotten here.   Came here tonight for Winterlicious without a reservation but called ahead and was told it would be about a 45 minute wait. We got there around 7pm, checked up on our position in line around 7:40 and was told we were second on the list - but kept hearing them tell other people that they were still seating the 7:00 reservations. Being patient about how busy it was, we waited and waited and waited because we Iove (or loved) this restaurant. At 8:30 we checked up on our spot and apparently our name disappeared from the list. They apologized and seated us immediately.  After a long 1.5 hour wait, we were greeted by a waiter who clearly hates his job and could care less about us - and managed to spill water on my shoes. Fine, whatever. At this point, I just wanted our orders in and our goddamn food because I swear we were ready to pass out from hunger. We got the caeser salad, calamari fritti, full rack of ribs, NY steak, carrot cake and creme brulee.   The caeser salad is now just a decorated romaine lettuce half. This is the laziest excuse of a salad ever - you might as well let me make my own. The calamari fritti had a weird burnt taste to it and so did the fries - I'm assuming it's from the oil used to fry these items. My ribs were as good as they always have been - fall off the bone and drenched in BBQ. The steak and mash, however, were served to us cold which is very surprising since it was so busy I didn't think food would be able to get cold. Then dessert came, the creme brulee and the chocolate cake - yupp, chocolate instead of carrot. We were so fed up with how the whole night was going that we didn't tell them about the mistake because it would just be another thing to wait on and probably get disappointed about.  Given that we're been here every year for at least once for the past 5 years, and we have loved it every time, this experience was enough to deter us from coming back."}
{"text":"Celebrating our 17th Anniversary we chose this restaurant and I'm really glad for it! Very good location, away from the busy downtown roads. Very cosy atmosphere, huge wine choices and delicious juicy steaks was only a few good qualities that I can name of. Our servant was super polite and helpful and to make our night the best, the management surprised us with delicious chocolate desert dish and a greeting card. Our whole experience was incredible!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good restaurant tucked away in a little side street. The food was pretty good and staff were friendly however, they were extremely slow. Took more than 10 mins for her to bring us the bill. Be prepared to spend quite a bit though!"}
{"text":"I made the reservations through Opentable and use a Fabfind coupon for this particular visit to Wildfire Steakhouse.   We have really attentive services even though we did not drink any wine or order a lot of food.   Grilled Calamari ($13)  - The calamari is nice and tender... not chewy at all. There is a little bit of smokey taste from the grill...  - The sauce is a little spicy and sour making it a great appetizer   Filet Mignon ($44)  - Cooked exactly as we requested. The server did make a good effort to make sure that she can tell the kitchen how we like our steak done..  - Beef is butterly tender, with nice grilled marks!   Grilled Sea Bass ($30)  - Really disappointed with the fish. The reason I like sea bass is really the great texture and the fresh taste. The sea bass I have here was sliced thinly then grilled. The texture is really mushy and has this bad fishy taste...  - I suggest to stick with the steak!   I think Wildfire Steakhouse is a little overpriced. I don't mind if I have a deal if I have to pay full price I don't think I will be eating here. Since I will be looking at paying around $100 per person with a full meal and drinks! There are a lot of other options at that price range!"}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious dinner. It was a delightful experience with them, from service to the restaurant renovation to the food quality.   I have to say they have one of the best winterlicious menus among all. Portions are generous as well, e.g. 8oz new york steak, 1 1/4ld lobster, etc. The desserts are well made:) I like to bake at home so I do require those served in restaurants to be better ones and Wildfire does make great cheesecake and creme brulee XD   In summary this is a good restaurant in mid town and I'm glad I tried its winterlicious menu. Definitely coming back in regular times! :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Is the first thing I have to say. This was my third stop on my Winterlicious tour and it's a must go to place in your in the mood for quality food and excellent service. I went here with a friend for a late night dinner. I found the atmosphere to be cozy, upscale and classy. I enjoyed the seating layout and didn't feel cramped into a small area.   I order the spinach salad to start, it came with goat cheese, cranberries, mandarin oranges and candied walnuts in their house made vinaigrette. Extremely tasty and satisfying. Now on to the main.. I could not believe my eyes when the plate I ordered came! I ordered the ribs with grilled bamboo shrimp served with handcut fries and seasoned vegetables. I portion was out of this world in size that I was in no shape to be able to finish it. It didn't go to waste that's for sure as I passed my leftovers onto my friend. The ribs were cooked to perfection, I know this because as soon as I put my fork into the ribs the meat just fell off the bone. The meat was tender, juicy and full of a great bbq flavour. The shrimp was seasoned lightly and cooked to perfection. The seasoned vegetables were roasted and also tender. For desert I ordered the caramel cheesecake brownie. I have never tasted anything like this before. I have been inspired to try a recreate this in my own kitchen some day.   Our server Brent was amazing, very friendly, and made us feel as if we have been regualr customers for years. Will return for sure and have been telling people to go ever since I went!"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular visitor to wildfire, and I don't think I will ever return, we waited almost 1 hour between appetizer and our main course.   We went there on a Saturday night with my parents, it was a disaster even the waiter told us they have problems every Saturday night.   I ordered my steak chard rare it came blue, my father order the steak medium rare it came rare, my mother's pasta was average at best.   Do yourself a favor and don't go there on a Saturday night. We got there at 7 PM and our meal didn't get to the table until 845."}
{"text":"This place is great. We have been here  a few times. This visit was by far the best. Service here is great. The staff is well trained and very polite. Many restaurants need to take some lessons on customer service and how to be pleasant from here. Carly was our server. She was patient and polite and smiley. The atmosphere is very romantic, quiet and low key. It was nice to talk to my partner without having to compete with other tables or loud music. We had the mussels and carrot ginger soup to start. Both were yummy. We also had the steak for our main. It was cooked to perfection. And of course the dessert was great - we had the cheesecake and the chocolate torte. The chef (Val) did a phenomenal job and Maxwell (the assistant manager) checked up on us  after our meal. Unfortunately Rock, one of the managers was not there but we enjoyed our dinner. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm using my 100th Yelp review as a PSA for everyone to avoid this place. Honestly the fact that the food was edible is what gave this place 2 stars but the service was horrendous. Perhaps this is why The Keg is more popular and successful than this place?  Came here for Winterlicious on a Sunday evening. I had made the reservations for a party of 3 at 7pm - my friend showed up 5 minutes earlier and the host was not welcoming at all and would not seat her until I arrived a few minutes later. This would make perfect sense for a busy restaurant.... except Wildfire was half empty when we arrived.  Perhaps the fact that we looked half the age as the rest of the diners was the reason why we were treated so terribly. The average age range of everyone dining in there was 60-80. Not to be rude, but also trying to be funny, but it felt like I was in an upscale retirement home.   Our waiter was not friendly - he did not ask if we wanted anything to drink, he collected items from out table without asking us, he coldly took our orders (without any eye contact), and we didn't see him until he collected our plates (without asking if we were done). He was quick to bring us our bills though. Honestly I felt like our wauter should go work elsewhere where he is not dealing with customers. The lack of service was disappointing.  Food wise - calamari ($16) was overcooked and chewy, steak was average and could have been seasoned better (the accompanying veggies were a bit on the burnt side!), and the triple C cheesecake? Average as well.  For an \"upscale\" steakhouse, this was a huge disappointment and not worth the price - please do not come here."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this steakhouse. We were seated promptly without reservations, however we did ask for a bigger table as we would've ordered more but was told they had no space, which was fine.  We ordered the escargot and found it a bit bland.  I ordered the short ribs which was to die for because it was melt off the bone and the mashed potatoes were also delicious and seasoned well. The lobster was a touch over done. Paired it with a white sangria which finished the meal.  Overall I was happy with the meal.   The service was a bit rough around the edges. seems like some people didn't know what they were doing but I'll chalk it up to the fact that maybe they were new and training."}
{"text":"We came here on a voucher. The food was slightly underseasoned but still quite tasty as the quality of the ingredients was very good.  The best part of our visit was the service! The hostess, the servers who brought our food and our waiter were all awesome. Our waiter started by asking if we were on our way to a show (which we were) and what time it was so that they could be completely sure to get us out on time. He was funny, attentive but not hovering, knew the menu very well, gave good beer and drink tips and even gave us a complimentary coffee and desserts!"}
{"text":"It was probably one of those evenings that was not supposed to go right - so disclosure at the start is my review may be biased!  This was a groupon deal for a four-course prix fixe dinner for two with wine and I had made a reservation beforehand. On walking into the restaurant, we were greeted by a Maitre'd/Captain who after the usual greetings and some awkward thrusting of hands,  made a faux pas of refusing to shake hands.   Ambience was quite good. Our waitress was apologizing for a long day while taking our orders and appetizers were whisked away before they were finished; we had to remind her to keep them back. It could be probably the separate groupon menu but our interactions with staff were limited and abrupt  as compared to other tables.   With regards to food- PIE mussels were not fresh but had a acceptable taste; fried calamari had some salad that was bitter tasting; so appetizers we had were average. For main course we had wildfire back ribs- huge portion but average taste again. Similarly, Chicken supreme was average. The desserts decadent chocolate torte and creme breule were both good.   Was it the groupon deal or is this establishment staff  not Asian customer friendly? Are they so pretentious? I am not sure who was more relieved once we finished our dinner and made haste to get out of the place- the staff or us! Definitely don't care to find out and will not ever revisit this establishment!   I had relied heavily on yelp reviews before taking the groupon deal for this place that is definitely on the expensive side. Now I am disappointed more  with yelp rather  than the restaurant!"}
