{"text":"Not bad, decent value, looks ghetto but don't let that get to you."}
{"text":"Good place to get Taiwanese Food. However the kitchen hygiene needs some improvement."}
{"text":"The side dishes and stinky tofu is really good. If I'm in the mood for those dishes I will return here. However, some side dishes like the cabbage tasted too old.  The tea egg was good.   The fried chicken seems popular here, a lot of folks were ordering it."}
{"text":"Cost: Good - 90% Quality: 85% Decor: Poor to none - 40% Value: 80%  The beef noodle soup was quite a disappointment. With everything else made right I don't understand why Wei used packaged udon noodle for the bns. I wonder if you have tasted your bns yourself Wei, the noodle is terrible! It single handedly ruined the whole bowl. Until this is changed to real noodle, I can't make myself return to this place even if the stinky tofu was of top-notch quality (Toronto standard).  The place is quite dirty, at least my chair was sticky and the whole place gives me the impression you don't wipe it down upon closing."}
{"text":"Very good and affordable. It's a good place to go if you want taiwanese takeout and you don't want to sit at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is ghetto!  Which is why I'm a fan.  It serves traditional Taiwanese food as its supposed to and doesn't pretend to be anything its not.  It is more of a take out joint so there's very few tables and chairs to dine in and they're not very well maintained.  Personally, I don't really mind doing a little work to wipe of the table as long as I get to enjoy their stinky tofu, red sausage, and popcorn chicken in peace.    I'd recommend this place for anyone that wants straight up traditional Taiwanese food w/out the fancy schmancy fusion.  Just don't expect top notch customer service, that is not what this place is about.    Thinking of going back for more stinky tofu as I'm writing this review.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Took my Taiwanese wife here,but it was closed. Fortunately, the owner let us in anyways. My wife had Taiwanese meatball (the sauce was great, just right size), pork intestine with noodle (good,even better with spicy sauce) and stinky tofu (good again). I had the Taiwanese sausage lunch box. I'm American, so this food has no special feel for me. We also got the fried crispy chicken, which is apparently a Taiwanese popcorn chicken.Tasted good, but nothing I would huger for. But my wife was so happy she looked like she was dancing when she got every dish. Really glad we found the place. The people were really nice and gave us directions to some other local places (we are tourists really). This is a great place if you are Taiwanese, no doubt."}
{"text":"The sign of this place was so hard to find and they need a new one. But the food was good for $6 w/ bottle of water.  If you want pop, it's an extra $0.50.    I ordered the Taiwanese chicken w/ 3 sides for $6 and water..which is great! Portion is big for $6. Nice staff and clean."}
{"text":"Not authentic Taiwanese cuisine...tried the noodles, bento and the rice sticky rice.   cold frozen inside rice sticky cake.    Dirty washroom and sitting area...not coming back"}
{"text":"Went during lunch today and ordered a Beef Noodle Soup, Spiced Chicken with Rice and Popcorn Chicken for take-out. The 3 sides that comes with the rice were cold and not fresh. And the WORST part was after eating 2/3 of the Beef Noodle Soup, we found a DEAD BUG (bee or fly) in the Soup. Extremely gross and the store doesn't feel sanitary. The food is cheap but quality and cleanliness is definitely not okay."}
{"text":"This place definitely reminds me of food stall and cheap eats in Taiwan -- down to the tables and stools! It's a mom and pop kind of place. I think usually there's only two or three people working there, but I may have just gone during down times. They serve a huge variety of dishes from Taiwan and the typical kind of lunch 'boxes'. I've tried their fried stinky tofu, oyster omelette, popcorn chicken, and stinky tofu stew. I think I may have tried some other stuff but I've been here a few times and I can't really recall! The flavours are pretty authentic. It's still my favourite place to get Taiwanese food in Toronto, but sometimes they don't have all the things on their menu, which can be a bit disappointing. There's also really limited seating, but it's usually pretty empty. I think a lot of people get things to go, and it's not really a sit and chat kind of place. The stinky tofu could be a bit stinkier but I won't complain, I feel lucky just to be able to get them here!"}
{"text":"As a take out venue, this place operates extremely slow. I was the only customer and my food took over half an hour to make..  The waiting experience was not pleasant either. With the outside temperature feeling like -25, the store did not turn on their heaters. The chairs were icy cold, and the side dishes that came with my pork rice was also cold as it was left outside.   Only thing I liked was the stinky tofu, however, the portion was not worth the price.. The rice was overcooked and soggy, with absolutely no texture.   Service was also disappointing - As I waited for over half an hour for three items and no one else in line, the server did his best to avoid eye contact and just chatted with those in the kitchen.  Nope, won't be back."}
{"text":"Good things about this place are: it's legit owned by Taiwanese, the portions are big and it's cheap. Other than these there's not much that's good about this place. The food you get here is very home tasting, I guess similar to a mother's cooking. This is a good place if you just want a bite without caring much about the food's quality.  P.s. their speciality is their stinky tofu (if you're into that stuff)"}
{"text":"For all those who line up for hours in night market, why? There is a storefront. It is just as cheap, and just as fresh. What else? They have more than just stinky tofu, but a wide variety of Taiwanese food favourites.  There is a small amount of seating area. Most people just grab take out and leave.   Does this place stink like the night market? No. I ordered the tofu and I can't even smell it until it's brought in front of my face.   Bring cash!"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Buffalo just to have stinky tofu at Wei's, and man, oh man, did they deliver.   They serve up excellent Taiwanese classics such as three cup chicken, Taiwanese sausage, eggplant and, of course, STINKY TOFU! as either small plates (a la night market) or as lunch boxes.   Portion sizes for their box lunches were excellent, each main comes with two side dishes, and the food tasted authentic and flavorful. I had gotten the three cup eggplant, which was mmmm-mmmmm good.  Now onto the stinky tofu: This is the only place that I know of that 1) has stinky tofu at all and 2) does it well, according to various reviews. Overall, I would have to agree as well. It's served up just like it is at Taiwnese night markets: on a plate with pickled cabbage. It wasn't as stinky as I'd like, but I have come to expect that of non-Taiwanese stinky tofu. In fact, certain cities have laws against fermenting the tofu for as long as it should ferment, so I hardly hold that against them. After all, I hear it's an acquired taste. All that being said, the flavor of the tofu was spot on, and their pickled cabbage was delish.  Why not 5 stars? Weellll... The stinky tofu was missing minced garlic. When I asked for it, they said there's garlic in a sauce that they make, and they then gave me the sauce. I have to go back and try the sauce again to make sure, but that day it had kind of a funny aftertaste that really took the experience down a notch. Not enough to deter me from making another drive back to Wei's, but just enough that I can't say this is as good as it gets. Granted, I'd be hard-pressed to give any non-Taiwan stinky tofu that perfect rating...  A couple things to be careful of:  1) it seems as though they make a big batch of food in the AM and open until they've sold out, so if you want to keep your menu options open, come earlier rather than later lest they run out of food. We had arrived at around 11, 11:30am, and I barely got the last of the eggplant. 2) it's a rather small space, not really meant for dining in, but they do have a couple tables. Last time, my party of 3 was able to make do just fine, but this place is definitely meant for takeout.  All in all, food was delicious and the owners were super, super nice! Best Taiwanese I've been able to get since moving to Buffalo. I consider it completely worth the drive."}
{"text":"A great place to get a cheap and decent Taiwanese Food. The lady who served us was really nice and accomodating. I tried the Taiwanese sausage lunch box and some stinky tofu. They are excellent for $7. Good portion, good taste."}
{"text":"*Mouth watering* Just thinking of it!  Okay, some may disagree but it's for adventurous eaters.  You either like or dislike STINKY TOFU!  I haven't tried it in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or places in Asia.  I heard it's tastier there.  If you can't smell it from blocks away, it's not good.  I don't have much to compare but been to Toronto Asian festivals.  I always hit these stands.  $3.99 for a plate consisting 5 block of tofu with cabbage drench in sauce...Mmmm  Ever since night market, I've fell in love with it.  Wei's is the best, line ups are extremely long!  I found this place through a coworker and I was excited cause it's a 5 minute drive.  Location is in a rundown plaza.  Don't expect much with decor cause it's a hole in the wall takeout with small chairs and 4 square tables (best fitted to Asians...LOL).  Hours are short, probably cause of smell or front for business (their mostly manufacturing frozen food packages).  You can smell their tofu from parking lot before stepping in.  Be warned...need to acquire a taste for stinky tofu but there are other items.  My girlfriend only allows me to eat at night market or when I'm out with coworkers (hence, she's not there).  She smells and tastes it off my breath even when I brush my teeth.  Mouthwash does the job ;)  Lots of breath mints before I head back to work.  We usually get their lunch boxes for $6.00 with pop (add $0.75 for special drinks like Arizona Green Tea/ 168 bottled drinks).  Lunch boxes come with 3 side items with main.  My favourite is Popcorn Chicken with 2 veggie side and marinated egg.  Really great DEAL!  TIP:  Their English is bear minimum and main language is mandarin.  Shouldn't have any problem cause I don't speak their language and get by with English."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some Taiwanese food so decided to try this place out.  Apparently this small restaurant has been there for a while I just never noticed it driving by as it's sort of tucked further inside the plaza. It's a very small restaurant with very limited seating The combos go for a decent price $6.50.  I ordered the crispy chicken combo and the stewed pork (lu rou) combo to go.  It took a while (25 minutes) for my order to be ready.  We came in around 7:30 and while I was waiting the lady that works there told the people that had ordered after me that they had run out of rice.  What kind of a Chinese restaurant runs out of rice more than 2 hours before closing??  They seemed to run out of a lot of the sides too so I had a very limited number of sides to choose from.  Anyway, by the time I got home I discovered that she had given me stewed chicken instead of pork!  Not impressed!!  For the price and the portions the place is OK, but I don't know if it's worth the hassle and the wait."}
{"text":"You can get a cheap Taiwanese lunch box here for around $7.  You choose a meat dish and select from a variety of veggie dishes. The quality??? Medicore.  But at this price point, I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Decent value Taiwanese \"Bento\" box!   A pretty much \"to go\" place with 3 or 4 small tables, Wei's offer something a little bit different than your typical Chinese fast food place.  The crispy chicken on rice was pretty good, and you get a choice of two side veg and a soup.  Only word of warning.. they serve Stinky tofu here.  While it may not reek like the back streets of Shanghai, you can still definitely smell it.  And if you're a fan of the smell of this stench, you might want to just take it to go.  I've never understood the appeal of the fermenting tofu!  http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=9396252"}
{"text":"Came to try the smelly tofu and it was excellent. Sauce is tasty and tofu fried to order.  Next time I'll come back to try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"I've been spoiled by great tasting popcorn chicken from PaPaChang, MetroSquare and from my travels abroad. But due to time constraints and working in the area, this \"hole in the wall\" will do to satisfy my fried chicken craving. For only $5.75 (was $5.25) you get a rice lunch box with 3 side dishes of your choice and a pop! Filling!  You'll find this place wedged between a Mexican and a Jamaican resturant. Limited seats (4 small tables), so prepare yourself for take-out. Oh yah... it's not in tip-top condition (could use some TLC)."}
{"text":"I was looking for Taiwanese crispy chicken around GTA and this place popped up. It is situated in the same plaza with Bong Lua, which is a good Vietnamese restaurant I have been to. Parking is a bit limited: too many stores in such a small plaza but is still doable.  Their lunch boxes have tasty crispy chicken and sausages with three choices of side dishes and bottled water/soup for $6.99. The portions are somewhat big and food is delicious. There are a few table if you want to dine in but it is definitely cramped. I would recommend takeout.   I'll second the comment that it is better to communicate with the cashier in Mandarin. She is such a sweetheart but I feel that it could be a bit of a challenge if you only speak English and want to make some inquires about the order.  Simple, tasty fast food!"}
{"text":"I'm dropping one whole star for Wei's because the Beef Noodle($5.25) was pretty disappointing especially when stepping into a Taiwanese restaurant.  I know they FOCUS mostly on Lunch Box and Frozen Food but I wasn't expecting this at all.  I'm hard to SURPRISE but Wei's did it.  When the friendly chef came out with our bowl it had the toppings that made it recognizable as Chinese Beef Noodle, such as the chopped Pickled Cabbage, Vegetable, Scallions.  What looked WRONG was the soup was clear/transparent which is never a good sign.  It tasted like they got the Beef Brisket from a HK-style restaurant which comes with soup and then just poured some of it on to the uninspiring Noodles.    The GOOD was that it was an A-OK portion which includes the Beef pieces that was falling apart just by chopsticking them.  If they advertised it as HK-style Noodle then I think it would have worked out."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and tried their combos for $5.99  I got the roasted chicken leg, and my fiance got the crispy chicken combo.  The popcorn chicken was tasty. The roasted chicken was fall off the bone and tasted great!  Service was fast, you get to pick 3 sides to come with your meal. Serving size is pretty fair, and the combo comes with a drink which is great. It's a good deal.  Over-all a pretty solid Taiwanese place. Personally, I prefer the roasted chicken leg over the popcorn chicken.  I will come back again to try more of their combos.   Review 72 of 100"}
{"text":"Definitely a cheap eat, in a good way!  They have more tables now than I remember them having, so that's a plus. We came as a group of about eight after church one day. We were going to go to Chris Jerk, but it's closed on Mondays. I didn't think Wei's would have enough tables to seat us all, but they did with a table or two to spare.  I had the popcorn chicken with rice combo ($5.99). It comes in what looks almost like a bento box. There was more rice than I could eat, a fairly generous portion of popcorn chicken for that price, and three sides. They have a hot table where you get to choose your sides, and they have a variety of them (at least 12, if I recall correctly). I had the eggplant, some kind of tofu, and some kind of seaweed. All of them were quite tasty. The popcorn chicken was flavorful and quite tender. If I recall correctly, the combo also came with soup or bottled water. I upgraded to a black rice punch drink in a can for $1. That was also quite interesting. If you want hot sauce, they have that too.   All in all, a good place to grab a cheap, hot meal. Quite satisfied. I've had their stinky tofu. They're the stall at Nightmarket, Night it Up, Taste of Asia, etc., that have the huge line up. I'm pretty sure it's cheaper to buy it here than it is to get it at those festivals, and the lineup is significantly shorter. If I recall correctly, they also have the Taiwanese big sausage, little sausage on their menu, but not described in that way on their menu. I'm planning on giving it a try next time I come."}
{"text":"This is a well kept secret in terms of Taiwanese food and just awesome food in general.   Unfortunately there's not much seating otherwise I'd rate it a 5, if they ever expand I'm sure they'll make a killing.   I've tried the rice/chicken combos, good portions, great prices and tastes fresh, I believe everything is made to order.  I love going for the spicy beef noodles and stinky tofu, there's no other place in TO that can make it like Wei's, reminds of Taiwan night market.   They also have frozen dinners, they can't compare to the fresh versions but they're better then ones you get from T&T."}
{"text":"Much brighter after recent renovation.  Better seating.  Prices went up but still a steal at $6.50.  Love the fried fish fillet bento with three sides.  We always choose soya egg, eggplant and seaweed.  Stinky tofu with no lineup - sign us up.  Tofu was fresh and cheaper than night market and food truck.  This is one of the best deals on Scarborough.  Which means I still have not tried hunter's pizza and the Mexican place in the same plaza.  Chris jerk and pho place are good too."}
{"text":"I had the most random craving for pig intestine today and decided to venture to Wei's to see if it would do the trick. Normally I get the popcorn chicken lunch that comes with a bottle of water for 6.49 and it is an amazing price for the amount of food you get.  Sadly, I wasn't too pleased with the bowl of noodles. The noodles were also 6.49 (doesn't co E with water) but the noodles only came with 2 thin slices of pork intestine! Fine-technically there were 3 but one of them is the end of the intestine and it was a baby slice. The soup tastes like hot and sour soup you would get at a dumpling house but without the spiciness. It has bamboo shoots, slices of mushroom, carrots, and cilantro just like most hot and sour soups. The meat in the noodles were meatballs that reminded me of spicier breakfast sausage.  I come here regularly and these noodles won't dissuade me from doing so. I will just stick with ordering the fried meats. On a side note, their stinky tofu here is really good. Sometimes you can even smell them frying it from outside the plaza."}
{"text":"Wei's Taiwanese food is a hidden gem in Scarborough. The food is always made fresh and you can choose from a variety of side dishes. For the price you will get a pretty large portion with the choice of water or soup; cheaper than night market food with bigger quantity and quality. According to my friend, this is an authentic Taiwanese restaurant.  I got the stinky tofu and the fried pork chop with rice which made for a good lunch. The pork was crispy and the tofu was not overly fermented. The pickled cabbage that came with it was also good. If you can stand the smell of stinky tofu, I recommend coming here.   The service was great, it is preferred you speak Mandarin here but the friendly cashier lady knows some English and will happily guide you through the selection process. They recently renovated in the last year so it has become much more spacious and bright."}
{"text":"Good enough for a homesick girl like me. Big portion of food and resonable ,affortable price, and the flavour was very very close to what i had when at home. The  only  thing i wanna complain was their staff dont speak Taiwanese,and Hey, thats the language to prove that you're real Taiwanese (restaurant)."}
{"text":"Super authentic and classic Taiwanese food. And did I mention stinky tofu?! The only downside is the place is not ideal for dining in. The place is very small with minimal tables and chairs. Very popular for take out though as they offer a wide selection of Taiwanese lunch boxes"}
{"text":"Food was meh, wasn't as great as expected. Super salty and wasn't as authentic as the ones we had back in Taiwan."}
{"text":"Expect to be there for the quality and quantity of the food and for nothing else. Great stinky tofu, well made, piping hot and comes with a side of crisp slaw. Cheap well made bento boxes of various fried meat with your choice of three sides. Portions are good and food is hearty.  Everything else is...not the best. There is no AC, so expect it to be stuffy. If you do sit under the small AC unit, water to drip on you and it might be black. The space is tiny and not renovated. So come for the stinky tofu and the food, and nothing else."}
{"text":"Braised pork belly always our favourite order. Usually we choose bento box for braised pork belly and comes with 3sides. Sometimes sides we choose wasn't good but 2 out of 3 times it was good. We will be back for noodle next time"}
{"text":"As a Taiwanese native living in Canada for over 20 years, I must say this place is on top of my list for the best Taiwanese joint in the country (yes, even better than those trendy Taiwanese restaurants in Vancouver). It may not be a fancy looking restaurant and it's hidden in a corner at a strip mall, but this is how it gets its \"hidden gem\" status. Food quantity has also been generous and the quality is also consistently good. My favourite is their beef stew rice. You can also purchase their food frozen (microwavable) from the store. Most of the people come here for lunch takeouts, however if you wish to eat in, there are 4 tables at the restaurant. The price is also very good. Whenever I miss home, I come here for lunch! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hmm...is it me??  Granted I don't have much experience with Taiwanese food, I wasn't thrilled with my food.    I ordered some stinky tofu and beef stew lunch box with bitter melon, chinese greens and green bean sides.  The stinky tofu was more pungent than I expected it to be and the vegetable sides all had a very similar spicing which made it difficult to enjoy.    I may try out Wei's again with my sister-in-law who is from Taiwan and see what her opinion is.  Until then, I remain....not a fan.  Boo...."}
{"text":"I had their Taiwanese popcorn chicken. It was juicy and freshly made. The price wasn't bad. However, I wished they didn't put the hot deep fried chicken into a styrophone container because the hot chicken that touched the container melted the styrophone which was very bad for health. I hoped they let the chicken cool down a bit or put some layers of paper so it won't directly contact with the box."}
{"text":"A good place located in the worst area. I was gonna give 4 stars but the area is so bad so i gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Super local taiwanese food. Affordable with decent taste, especially the deep fried chicken. I will come back."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food. It's what you'd crave at night market too. I go for the lunch/dinner boxes. Aren't too many of these restaurants in toronto, so this is a rare gem.   What's extra special is the homemade feel of the cooking. It's great value, delicious Taiwanese food.  Recommend the fried chicken lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Their portions are big and I love how you can choose your own side veggies - or egg. I almost always get their fried chicken (aka popcorn chicken) and its always great. I'm not a huge fan of stinky tofu but my bf says its in the top 3 in Toronto.   This little place is great for a fast lunch or take out. The owners are very nice and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone that likes Taiwan food."}
{"text":"We came here as Chris Jerk doesn't open on Sunday... I tried the popcorn chicken with rice. For $6.49 + tax you get a generous portion of popcorn chicken, rice, soup/water and a choice of three sides.  For the price, it was quite a good deal..my only complaint is that the sides are cold (they try their best to cover it with foil to keep it warm or clean but it still gets cold!).  They also serve a ton of other very traditional Taiwanese dishes such as stinky tofu, three cups chicken, Taiwanese sausage, noodles, etc.  There are about 4-5 small tables and plenty of utensils/napkins available which is appreciated."}
{"text":"Known about this Stinky Tofu place for a long time. Was stopping by Chris Jerk's and got pulled it by a friend.  Got a small order of Stinky Tofu take-out for about $5 and change.   Tofu had good texture, not completely deep-fried and was juicy.  I think the sauce needs some work, not spicy or smelly enough..  4 stars because it's still one of the best in the  neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We stopped by this small strip mall to go to one of the other restaurants, but when we got out if the car we smelled the stinky tofu and decided to try this place. My wife ordered the beef noodle and the stinky tofu. I ordered the fried fish fillet with rice (this came with a choice of 3 sides and soup or pop). We did not have to wait too long for our food. My wife said her beef noodle was delicious. She found the stinky tofu good but different than Hong Kong style (the sauce was a bit spicy for me). My fried fish fillet was well prepared and delicious. Both our portions were big and filled us up. The lady at the counter was friendly and the prices were reasonable. Will definitely return. The reason I gave 4 stars is because of the space. Very little space if you want to eat there. All 3 tables were taken so we went to eat at home."}
{"text":"Great food, but limited seating. Nice selection of side dishes too.   Definitely get the Taiwanese fried chicken and the sausage!"}
{"text":"Wei's Taiwanese Food is a hidden gem that's tucked away in a standard suburban plaza. The decor is fairly spartan and dated. Although it's meant as a takeout place, there's a few tables for those who wish to dine inside. They are primarily known for the popcorn chicken and stinky tofu, both items of which they do quite well. The popcorn chicken is soft and crispy, and the bento boxes are very filling with generous portions for a good price. All in all this is a great place for a quick bite, or for a box of popcorn chicken to take with you on a road trip!"}
{"text":"My first impression was that it was your average strip plaza wannabe restaurant. But in fact I was very wrong! My girlfriend and I came here on a lazy Friday evening after a tough day of work and snow-shovelling so we wanted to just relax and not think about much.  The one lady who was working both the cash register and the kitchen was churning out orders like a machine, very impressive!  We ordered the pork-chop rice bento, a beef noodle bowl, and obviously the stinky tofu! The bento came with 3 sides you could choose from (steamed veggies, stir fry brocoli, szechuan eggplant, etc.) and also a choice of pop or soup, while the beef noodle bowl had a very genuine soup broth and hearty soup ingredients (my only complaint about the noodles was that the noodles were slightly overcooked so they melted rather quickly in your mouth).  The stinky tofu was excellent, it was stinky enough while the pickled cabbage gave it a nice balance.  All three cost about 18 dollars, which is not totally unreasonable but odd given the size of the food (they were all pretty small). The place itself was a bit cramped because of its awkward location in the plaza, and it can be really cold if you choose to dine-in during the winter evenings.  Definitely worth another visit for the food and experience, but maybe next time I'll take my order to go!"}
{"text":"Eating the Stinky Tofu ($3.99)  at Wei's Taiwanese do remind me of the stinky tofu I ate in Taipei Shilin's night market.   Though this experience is so much cleaner and comfy then standing in the middle of the street in the heat and trying to make sure that you don't drip all the sauce down your top.  Though the Tofu is deep fried, it does not taste oily.. using fresh oil to deep fried at the temperature with the right timing makes the tofu just light golden brown and crispy outside and soft inside.  The Beef Noodle ($5.25) is just ok... The noodle a little soft.. the broth does not have the spiciness, the beef though tender is not the chunk beef  more like beef brisket serves in Cantonese noodle place.. but it is plentiful and good they do put veggie inside.  I will definitely be back for some more stinky tofu.. but definitely going to eat in.. as I don't want to stink up my car or freak out the people at work!  They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"im personally a fan of this place...  the price is good.. popcorn chicken was good but not salty enough and the rice could have more minced beef for flavor...  but other than that .. it tasted good.  worth the price in my opinion..  place was freezing though.. they stinge on the heat in winter.   Check out my picture of the popcorn chicken combo and look to the left of it for a surprise."}
{"text":"I saw a pic of their peanut sticky rice sausage and decided to give this little Taiwanese shop a try after a wedding.   At $4 for two pieces I expected a little bit more than what I got. It's basically a Taiwanese sausage with parsley and peanut sauce with a bit of kick put inside sticky rice and wrapped in a sausage film.   The taste of it was interesting but not enough for me to justify the price and effort to come here.   I also ordered their fried crispy chicken with rice and three sides at $6.   The side I got was eggplant that had a bitter aftertaste. Foody Marts eggplant dish equivalent was way better.   The egg was a bit meh after the first bite so I stopped.   The only side I actually ate relatively happily was the steamed broccoli.   The chicken was dry and severely lacked the umami compared to Papa Chang.   In addition their cutlery is near pointless. The cheap bento tray was bending with little food on it.   The spoons were not even strong enough to cut through the sausage skin.   The fork could barely pierce through the dry chicken.   Overall my experience was lousy. The only consolation is that even if the seat next to us ordered stinky tofu it wasn't too pungent."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm in a mood for some good old fashioned Taiwanese food. It's been 7 years this place doesn't change too much. They got your standard lunchboxes with a choice of main meat course on rice with pork &pickled veggies, and 3 sides of your choice from the steam table. Everything is made fresh to order and the sides are made and refilled as need and daily. Although the prices have gone up a little ,but in this economy everything goes up. The quality and flavour is still here. My favourite would be the stinky tofu and the side of preserved cabbage, that side dish compliments the tofu so well it csnt be without it (I've try other places, it's just not the same without it and not from here). Another favourite is the popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausage, you can get them in a meal and comes with either drink or soup for $6.50 now. But still pretty worth it."}
