{"text":"I'm so glad I drove by 3 filibertos to try this place out. It does look pretty suspect on the outside, but my food was fresh. I got the breakfast burrito (chorizo egg and potatoes with cheese) . Definitely going to be stopping by every time I want Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Tried a carne asada taco, wasn't anything special. The guy behind the counter was pretty nice but I think he was doing everything himself! Taking orders from both the counter and drive thru and I think he was doing the cooking too! I might give it another try just to give something else a try but honestly don't have my hopes up too high."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burritos that I had in Phoenix! Coming from the taco capital of the world Austin Texas it's not bad at all. This burrito is as big as my wife's arm! Add some avocado and you have a party"}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos around! I go here almost every Saturday morning to get it! Haven't tried much else on the menu but friends who have tried other item loved it too!"}
{"text":"Being from California...it's been hard to find a good Mexican spot. This place definitely did not disappoint me. The Tacos and the Carne Asada fries were amazing. Definitely give this place a try. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Picked up some breakfast burritos here this morning. They are huge, they are also very good. There is a drive through which is convenient. I haven't had lunch or supper here but definitely recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"I moved to Goodyear from Chicago about 8 months ago and just found this place.  Best food I've had since moving. Feels like the small shops back home, food just as good and priced incredibly well.  Love it.  Will frequent here."}
{"text":"Good place for carne Asad fries. Only beans and Pico de Gallo are not offered with the plate you have to get those separately if you wish. Great Aguas frescas ( jamaica and horchata)"}
{"text":"Stopped very late on a Wednesday night and was surprised to find a quality spot like this being open in a sleepy part of town.  Had a MASSIVE California burrito, delicious chicken taco and a rolled taco combo between our party. The chicken taco was excellent,  the burrito was real solid and the rolled tacos were fresh and paired with some of the most delicious rice I've had in a while.  Really happy that they opened up and will definitely be back, hopefully if they get more busy they can hire more people to speed things along."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Reasonably priced. The restaurant itself could use a good cleaning and organizing. It looks like they gave up in the middle of a remodel or repair. The girl at the counter was very sweet.   The beef in the tacos is succulent and flavorful. Nice crispy shells without being tough. The beans and rice were seasoned nicely and cooked properly.   They have a very complete menu with lots of choices."}
{"text":"Food was good. It was slow when I showed up on a Sunday afternoon which was good because I needed some time on deciding on what I want. I went with street tacos, quesadilla,and a chicken chimichanga. It took 2 days to finish lol. The chimichanga was so huge it was almost as big as my forearm! Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the whole thing and it has been reheated too many times and it went to waste. The service was great! The guys who served me was super friendly and pleasant. I would def come back here and suggest it to others."}
{"text":"Food was always good when it was Ubaldo's Taco Shop. It's even better now that it is Rosendo's Taco Shop. The food, the menu, the  ordering process, and wait time are all much better now."}
