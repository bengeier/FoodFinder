{"text":"This restaurant really surprised me.  I was visiting the area for the local spa and picked this restaurant based on a dinner deal through the hotel.  The menu was an abbreviated version but included three courses.  The pizza was one of the best I've ever had.  It seemed a combination of the crispy crust and the cheese which made it so unique.  All I can say is I returned the next day to find that the restaurant didn't open for lunch.  That was my only disappointment.  The soup, pizza and dessert was so delicious!  I recommend everyone tries it just once."}
{"text":"I lived in this neighborhood for quite a long time but never took the time to try this restaurant. So one day i decided to give it a shot. I took the seafood alfredo pasta while my sister took the rose. The price was kind of on the expensive side and my plate was extremely greasy. It didnt have enough veggies nor seafood and most of it was just alfredo sauce, oil and noodles. I wasn't satisfied with the food and I would recommened going elsewhere if you want to eat good pasta."}
{"text":"(English below) Petite trouvaille adorable que j,ai ajouté à ma liste de restos sur mon cell.   Leurs pizzas à croûte fine est sublime!  Ils ont un bar sportif et une section resto qui mêle le confort au semi-chic. Rien de prétentieux et tout réside dans leur simplicité.  Mon resto préféré pour parler avec une ami tranquille dan un coin.  Hmmm... en écrivant ceci, je me dis pourquoi pas ce soir?  Bonne découverte!  ---  Little adorable discovery that I have added to my list of restos on my cell.  Their thin pizzas are to live for!  They have this mini sport bar section and the rest is the restaurant part which mixes confort and semi-chic ambiance. Nothing pretentious and everything resides in its simplicity.  My favorite resto to go eat and talk with a girlfriend in a quiet corner.  Hmmm... writing this ams telling myself \"why not tonight?\".  Have an amazing discovery!"}
{"text":"We chose this place based on the proximity to our hotel. We were delighted with the atmosphere and suprised to find live music too. Somewhat standard italian cuisine, but the food and service were both above average."}
{"text":"As we were looking to have lunch in the area we came across Joya. We ordered a pizza and a steak sub and we split both. The stake sandwich was excellent. 5 stars in my book but the pizza was a 3 star. I found that the pizza like most places lacked in the sauce. Very few places get that right. Anyway over all good service and pretty good food."}
