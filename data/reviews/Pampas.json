{"text":"great food great service you need to try but be hungry when you come the service is unbelievable"}
{"text":"Endless delicious meats served straight to your table ? yes please !!!! 

Service was fast and servers were funny and professional! In particular our server Francisco !"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Highly recommend this restaurant.  Great service!  Make sure to wear your stretchy pants!"}
{"text":"Great meal. If your hungry you will not be disappointed. Non stop perfectly cooked meats and a well stocked salad bar."}
{"text":"Second time here in Pampas Planet Hollywood. Service was great from our server Lily to all the ones that served the meat. Lily was always checking if we are in need of anything. Food was amazing. Fruits were fresh, salads were good and the meat tender and tasty. Had a great dinner with the hubby."}
{"text":"If you dont come eat at this place while youre in Vegas.....you're seriously missing out. Loved it."}
{"text":"Got charged a \"water conservation fee\".  Waitress did not know menu or drink menu.  \"I don't know.  I'm not a beer girl\". Over priced.   Didn't even order water.  Some guy just came and poured water.  Does every restaurant in Vegas have to charge a water conservation fee?"}
{"text":"Food was great and so was Ambur! We had the chicken and sirloin and the chocolate mouse eruption! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not the best we have been to. Meat flavor was average and salad bar did not offer anything special. Very expensive for the quality and service. Also played Christmas music and its January!"}
{"text":"Great food come hungry.  food is good and drinks great too.  Good service.  make sure to have a lot of room."}
{"text":"Here with a $50 voucher and got the surf n turf... The meat was okay but both the salad/sides bar and the seafood were mediocre. My wife liked their fish stew soup and I liked the fried plantains. Service was friendly. We stayed awhile to watch college ball and NBA games and they accommodated our TV requests. Overall it wasn't great (wouldn't come again if we didn't have a voucher) but food and service weren't horrible like some other reviews say, and the lunch price is pretty reasonable ($21 for meats, $30 for meats seafood).

Oh and we really like Jeff the waiter :)"}
{"text":"Worst churusca restaurant I have ever tried. Stay away from this place if you want good service and servers who can understand simple English. If you ask for water, expect to wait 20 mins before you get it. That's how bad service is."}
{"text":"Yumm definitely recommend the Brazilian Lemonade! Used a coupon and got half off for lunch - totally worth it, so full!"}
{"text":"Definitely a spot to go only when you have a lot of time to kill and literally feel like eating an entire cow.  The food was good, service was alright, but I felt like the selection of meats was limited compared to other similar places I've been.  It was a good spot for our large group and prompted a lot of conversation.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Took 30 mins for anything to happen - meat had to be flagged down, seafood had to be requested at least 3 times, dessert wasn't served till we we're walking out the door (we had given up on it and didn't feel like reminding our server), and check took its own sweet time too.. 
I will say that once the meat servers realized that we wanted meat and were annoyed, they came more frequently... But it took us raising our hands many times to get anything. 
Unfortunately, the same thing happened to two other tables in the main dining area- one seated next to us who left after salad after getting annoyed. 
Understand it's a Vegas buffet but could be a lot more efficient!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price I have been to a lot of Brazilian stake houses and this was the worse one too crowded
Food was over cooked and the quality was low due to high number of customers 
The customer service was good
The bill came up to hundred and thirty for two which is not worthed"}
{"text":"I would never eat here again.

For $58 a person you get unlimited meat and you get some sides from a buffet type set up. The sides weren't all that and the meat was dry and flavorless.  Plus it is not humanly possible to eat enough food to make this place worth the price.  It is a good restaurant idea for them financially but for the customer, not so much.  

I would have been happy if the food had at least been good.  I will say they have good cocktails.  The customer service is not bad.  They charged us a \"water conservation fee\" ?  I only ended up at this restaurant because it came as a combo deal on one of the shows I was seeing.  When I purchased the combo deal I thought I was getting an actual deal by getting to eat the unlimited meats but the deal didn't even include that, I had to pay a price difference for the unlimited anyway but I figured I should get the full experience.  Coming here was a mistake.  I will never buy another show/meal combo and I won't ever eat at Pampas again."}
{"text":"Don't let all these reviews think this place is worth it. Expensive and there are additional fees your not aware of."}
{"text":"Amber was great! She was super attentive, prompt with everyone's drinks, and apologetic when our food came out late. Yassss"}
{"text":"Out of the 4 Brazilian steakhouses is Las Vegas I would put this one in 4th place.

The food is fine.  The service was very good but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. They charge for water automatically which was a surprise after we ordered. The food, however, was delicious. We received a voucher for dinner after seeing a show so we had a set menu from which to choose. I had the steak which came with mashed potatoes, green beans, and one trip to the salad bar."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and want a good meal with unlimited meat! Here is your spot! There are 5 of us and they put us in a private room!! Also we had a special Brazilian drink! Must recommend! They bring the meat to you and cut it at your table, around 20 different meat and seafood! Very delicious and the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here and will def be back! Great food, friendly service and def a fam environment. See you soon Pampas!"}
{"text":"I am giving one star but I must explain that I actually didn't even get to eat the food! They are supposed to bring meats to your table but I waited 25 minutes. The server did bring me a drink and was very nice. However, I didn't get one piece of meat and after 25 minutes of waiting, I got up and walked out. Obviously, they are not being managed properly and have no idea how to provide proper service."}
{"text":"The meats were moist and tender. Never waited for a server as the move through the room non-stop."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was better. We usually avoid the strip in Las Vegas but always make an exception for Pampas."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the experience, the best you'll find in LasVegas . Food tasted fresh and amazing and staff were very helpful . Thankyou Pampas for the great dinner experience, definatly recommending it to anyone that wants a good quality feed, that won't affect the budget to much."}
{"text":"Everything was really good. Sean was our amazing server. We enjoyed everything from the starters and to our meats. This is a great place to take a date, friends, or family. Awesome food, great drinks, and amazing service. Ask for Sean. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was okay when compared to Texas de Brazil. No comparison, Texas de Brazil kills Pampas! They tried to  give us the impression that our bill would have been $176 if we would have not been so lucky get the discount coupon they they gave us at the front door, which it looks like everyone gets some type of discount and no one pays full price. I kinda feel like they tried to scam us with suggesting we tip them off of the $176 which (according to the person that brought us the check) we were so luck to have not paid. Then there is a statement about new credit card regulations regarding tips needing to be changed with the bill. We are out last night so that new regulation must have came out this morning. It all just got wired when the bill was brought to us. I'll never go to Pampas again."}
{"text":"I love meat and I've been a huge fan of Brazilian steakhouses since I tried one years back. This place was HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING... I had eaten here a few years back and remembered it being descent. I was browsing Groupons and saw a deal for it and was pretty excited and bought it right away. Decided to have a date night and was really looking forward to having a great meal. So I thought....so first off the service was terrible. I've worked in the service industry so I know how hard it can be so I'm not usually to critical. We all have bad days. But jeez, when someone gives you dirty looks, speaks to you rudely, and literally acts like they don't want to give you the time of day it's just unacceptable. I actually spoke to the manager and he said he was sorry and sent over another server. 
On to the food now. It's nothing like I remembered it. The salad bar was so so. Things that should have been cold were warm and that makes me a bit nervous. I don't want to get sick off of creamy salad dressing that's been sitting out all day. So I skipped that once I had a bite or two. What really upset me was it was so hard to request anything to eat and when it finally came out it was cold and tasteless. It really ruined my date night because I was hungry and frustrated. We eventually just gave up trying to get anything to eat. Ended up leaving as soon as we could and just got a slice of pizza from another place. Complete waste of money and they really don't seem to care about customer service. It's gone down hill and I wish I could give it 0 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night for dinner. We were told by a family member how awesome this place was. We didn't have the same experience that he had. 

We got a coupon on vegasinsiders.com and got the steak rodizio and unlimited shrimp for buy one get one free. Good thing we did!!! I have been to two other restaurants like this before and this one was the worst. The dinning area is small. We kept having people bump our table when they walked by. The waiter came and I gave him the coupon and he said that we needed to buy drinks in order for the coupon to work. He pushed that they were alcoholic drinks and tried to upsell us on a drink packages. I said \"no we don't have to buy alcoholic drinks we both just want a coke and a water.\" We never got the water!
 
We went to the salad bar and it had a small selection. The potatoes and cheese bread were good. The only reason I gave two stars is because the meats were tasty. The pineapple however was nasty. Usually it's the best thing on the menu. But here all you could taste was the burnt charred surface. 

Then the bill came. We had a $2 charge for water that we never got. The waiter told us that we needed to fill out the receipt with tip before they ran a credit card. He said it was a new rule. Then conveniently he had the tips worked out for us at 15% and 20% if the bill was full price without the coupon we used. He said he figured them out for us. I laughed at him and said you want us to pay for water we never got. Also you want us to tip you on a price we didn't pay.

A couple with the same coupon sat next to us after we got there. The same waiter did the same sales tactic with them and tried to sell them on alcoholic beverages with the coupon. He succeeded and sold them on a pitcher of sangria. After the waiter left the guy said to his date he didn't know they had to buy alcohol. 

We will never come back here! To much great food in Vegas to waste time on below average food and service at expensive prices!"}
{"text":"I really give a low grade but when you charge a dollar per person for water and don't tell them that is wrong besides that the experience was unpleasant with the waiter the salad bar where kind of a mess and never have bread house it was empty the soup was cold and I've been here a few times before but the experience was disappointing. We order the salmon sandy was the smallest portion I've ever seen in my life a pendant been more than two ounces"}
{"text":"Great family place ! Delicious meats & sides! A must go if in Vegas. Our server George was outstanding"}
{"text":"We've been to a few different Brazilian restaurants and this one was very good w/o being pretentious. While not a huge variety the meats were good and flavorful. The salad bar was lacking but who's there for that!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing restaurant! Picked this spot last minute because we missed our reservation somewhere else & since we r from hawaii there are NO bazilian restaurants on the island so we stop here. Im so getting tired of buffets because somtimes the quality of the foods arent there so little hesitant of eating all you can eat style but Im glad we did. We had the All you can eat meat & salad bar. Alejando was a fast, helpful waiter. he checked on us constantly even w/all the tables he was serving. He told us what the specials were w/o us asking & wasnt 2 pushy about it. he was funny 2.  the only thing I didnt like was the picture girls at the end. She told us \"taking pictures are free, I promise\" so we take the pictures & then she comes back w/a postcard size picture & says \"this is free\" mind you the picture on the card is smaller size than a id photo. then she goes but if you want \"these they r 2/30.\" which were larger ones.  so all i have 2 say is they should be upfront about the pictures they take cause it wastes peoples time & while they enjoying their meal."}
{"text":"We come to Pampas everytime we come to Vegas which is every couple months. The meat is always delicious, salads and fruit fresh and waitstaff pleasant. On this occasion I ordered the surf n turf rodizio and after the first plate discovered I decided I would prefer the muscles not in the sauce it came in. I asked our waitress who asked her manager if it was possible to get the muscles out of the sauce and she came back from the kitchen she had ordered me a plate of muscles cooked in white wine instead of the tomato sauce. I was very impressed with her going above and beyond in doing that. Thank you Pampas always delicious!"}
{"text":"Been to many Brazilian steakhouses and this would probably be at the bottom of the list. It felt cramped and loud in the restaurant. The salad bar did not have a very good selection. Typically the bread rolls and plantains come to your table but here they were at the salad bar. The plantains were terrible and the bread was gone. The meat quality was ok. Not nearly flavorful as other places I've been. The sangria was awful. Did not finish. The best thing was the caipirinha."}
{"text":"It was amazing. There was no waiting on a Wednesday night and the waiters were very friendly and polite at the same time . I recommend definetly. Jorge was the best."}
