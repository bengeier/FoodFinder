{"text":"I went here with 4 other friends. We all got FOOD POISONING the next day. I highly do NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Out of all the AYCE places in Toronto I've been to, this definitely wins. They took us in a little past 10pm, after we were denied an AYCE menu at another sushi place down the street because \"it was too late.\" The food came promptly but didn't impact the quality of the rolls. Everything was AMAZING. The price is reasonable too, even for dinner (compared to other places that charge outrageous prices for dinner). 
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, which they do through just eat.  It was on time and pretty good.  I had the meat dumplings which came in a spicey soup, beef Maki, Spicey Salmon Crunch Maki and a few assorted tuni sushi pieces.  All-in-all I would order from them again, but I will try a few other places first before making them my go-to."}
{"text":"Like a previous poster said, their prices are pretty low, but they do reflect their (relatively bad) sushi. I opted for delivery today, so I can't comment on the dine-in experience. Although the delivery was quick (25 minutes for a party of three), my friends and I wondered about the care and attention they put into making the sushi. Some of the rolls we ordered were the Volcano rolls, Spider rolls, Football rolls, and Downtown rolls. We also ordered their tempura dish. 

Firstly, the filling to rice ratio was HUGE. By that, I mean there was barely any rice covering the outside of each piece. When the rice wasn't soggy and mushed up, it was hard and deteriorating. Neither my friends nor I could pick up any piece of sushi without chunks of the rice or the fillings falling out. 

The entire time, I didn't feel like I was eating sushi because (without realizing it), we'd  ordered all non-raw foods for the filling. This meant eel, crab, yam, and tempura shrimp. The yam was harder than usual which led me to believe they were undercooked. As for the smoked salmon? It was FULLY COOKED salmon! Not my cup of tea because I'm used to eating fresh cold sushi, not soggy warm sushi. 

The tempura also wasn't the greatest. I usually find myself gorging yam and shrimp tempura and pretty much any kind of tempura, but not this time. The yam tempura weren't the flat orange pieces I was accustomed to, but the thinly sliced french-fry style. Their eggplant were wide, but pushing paper thin. Each time I lifted any tempura piece into my mouth, all I could taste was the oily batter. Even this batter, which should be crispy and crunchy, was soggy and tasteless. 

With that said, the first star goes to speedy delivery and the second star goes to the extras that came with our order. We were pleasantly surprised to see two cokes, one small portion of salad, and one small container of miso soup.

They've lost me as a customer though. I've tasted better sushi for the same or a lower price, so why linger?"}
{"text":"We came to Sashimi Island after we found out our favourite sushi spot in T.O had closed down. Sad but defiant in our search to find a new special sushi spot. We yelped and this was the second place to come up in the area. I never came first in anything so I like the number two which is why we ended up here. 
On arrival we were seated and everything seemed clean and bright. The waitress gave us our menus and the paper checklist. I wanted a glass of plum wine and my partner wanted a coke. It turned into some kind of weird skit after a while as the waitress couldn't understand what we were asking for. 
So onto the food. We ordered from the $16.99 menu which excludes the sushi and sashimi. A selection of apps and rolls came to our table alongside the miso soup and the green salad. 
The salad was covered in orange dressing and not unpalatable but not very pleasant either. The rice in all the rolls was warm. The apps were probably the best part of the whole meal. The beef wrapped mushrooms were lovely and the shrimp tempura was also good. That's about where it ends. 
The waitress continually hovered over us whilst we were eating. I don't like to be hovered over when I am chowing down. It leaves me feeling ragey. The table won't self destruct if a plate stays on it. 
We certainly haven't found our new sushi place and we won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"I had always heard great things about this place, but after getting delivery from them, I likely will not be going back. To be fair the weather isn't great outside, and it is a Friday night, but it took almost 2 hours to get our food. I called after 1.5 hours of waiting to ask what was going on, they called the driver and then called me back and said they'd be here in 5 minutes. After 20 minutes they still were not here so I called again and they said they were just arriving now. I asked if we could get a discount and they said no, but said they would give us free pop - oo how thrilling! The delivery guy was super sweet and appologized for the delay and he gave us 2 free cokes. I guess it wasn't his fault, but they clearly need more delivery people on the road if one person can't handle it themselves. 
Once we got the food we sat down and started eating and everything was soggy and cold... definitely not as tasty as we would have liked. 
Overall the food wasn't great, nor was the service, but at least they were nice about it."}
{"text":"Any complaint I have is nullified by the takeout deal.  2 rolls for 5 dollars! The options are limited for this deal but you can still get a couple different salmon or dynamite rolls or veggie options .  Not only do I consider this the best deal on sushi in the city... it might be the best deal period. Now onto the quality of the sushi.  It's much better than grocery store sushi. Maybe it's it doesn't match up with the very  high end places in this city but I think it actually beats some of the really popular budget places on Bloor (Big Sushi and Sushi on Bloor I'm looking it you). The service is quite fast, I've never done sit down so I can't say what that would be like.  If I had a nitpick I would say they are a little stingy on the wasabi but I do like more wasabi then most.  So if you're ever broke and want some passable sushi this is the spot."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Sashimi Island since its inception (usually always AYCE, a few times a la carte):

The Good:
Food pretty fresh
Staff all amazing, very friendly and hard-working
Kitchen/Chefs are darn hardworking and efficient!!
AYCE Menu pretty extensive - lots of choices

The not-so-Good:
They don't open for Lunch anymore, not even weekends!!!
They put the price for AYCE up to $19.99 so value for money is only so-so now (I'm from Vancouver so conditioned on much better sushi value)
Rice sometimes unfortunately warm - they often run out of rice and need to make new batch quickly."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from them from order it.ca.  I waited 90 minutes for my order and it never arrived.  I had to call them and they had notified me that they had received my request through email which they do not accept.  I don't know why no one notified me as now I'm hungry and angry.  Maybe they are a good restaurant in person but I doubt I will ever know."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi place I have ever been to I L-O-V-E this place the menu is massive I have never had so many different kinds of sushi and all so delicious not bad for $20 not bad at all and it's not just limited to sushi they also have rolls, soups, salads cubed steak, sashimi and Ice cream for desert all included in the all you can eat menu. The decor is also really nice, the waiters are friendly and attentive. If I lived across the street I'd come eat here everyday."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE in town.
Hopefully you get Bin as your server, he is fantastic. The other waitstaff are OK.
Good price for good food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this place opened, but decided to try delivery for the first time tonight. Bottom line, it was disgusting. This place had been consistent for years, with its fresh selection and large portions but both have plummeted.

The sashimi and nigiri fish tasted.. off. Like they slapped it in the container before it had time to thaw. A slight odor to the fish as well. The maki rice tasted like it was coated with chemicals.. probably from using a dirty rag to wipe down the prep area. It was also cold and the rice was not fresh. The deep fried tofu also had a similar taste, probably from being sliced on the same surface or with similar negligence. Chefs - take note: you should not be using the rag you use to clean your surfaces to wipe off your knives. 

For $30, I expected far more from this place. Long gone are the days of leftovers.. I had to throw the entire meal right in the garbage. Will not be returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"The low prices make it totally worth it. 

Not the best sushi in the world, but definitely good, especially for all you can eat. I like the structure of their AYCE menu too; you get to choose between just rolls, everything but sushi and sashimi, and everything including sushi and sashimi. 

I also really like the variety of vegetarian rolls; not just cucumber and avocado here. 

The most noteworthy thing is probably their staff; so nice and friendly.

Lunch specials are a super good deal, but BE WARNED; their lunch hours are weird. Give them a call to make sure they're open."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come to Sashimi Island when we want to indulge in AYCE sushi. Service is always great and the sushi is excellent for the price point. As with most AYCE sushi places, the key to a most pleasant dining experience is ordering the right items. The sashimi is always fresh and the hand rolls are the absolute best things on the menu! The seaweed and avocado salad is a must order. The quality food and reliable service keeps us coming back again and again."}
{"text":"We've been here many times over the years and always thought the food was good and service was quick - especially considering it's an AYCE. However unfortunately our most recent experience was pretty bad! A few dishes came out, but then we had no food at all for quite some time.  It was probably a good 20 minutes during which we had an empty table (except for our dirty dishes which they didn't clear). We asked whether our food was coming, to which they replied yes. We waited a bit longer, but still nothing came. 

Perhaps they were overwhelmed by takeout orders. Ultimately they had totally neglected the few customers that were dining in-house. They didn't offer tea or even an apology during this awkward gap in food service.

We eventually decided to cut our losses and head to another restaurant. Perhaps the only saving grace is that, sensing our disappointment, they comped us the few things we had received. 

Sadly, Sashimi island will no longer be on our go-to list of restaurants!"}
{"text":"Nice AYCE Japanese restaurant,the food is tasty and very fresh sashimi with very good price and service."}
{"text":"They've since removed the Spider Roll, and the overall quality of the rolls has gone down. Downgrading to a 3."}
{"text":"I had been getting the take-out rolls special for months with no issue. I noticed the last few times the fish itself was a bit inconsistent - ends of larger bits, white edged rather than pink, poorly cut - but they always made it to order while I watched and waited and it tasted good and the fish was cold.

Today I ordered, and after a long wait the chef came in from the back, while texting, didn't put on gloves or wash his hands, and sliced up a premade roll that was sitting out on the counter covered in saran wrap (since before I came in). I tried one bite and it was clearly room temp and made ages ago. I asked for a fresh set from the manager and he refused, he would only offer a refund. I said I was happy to wait, but they would not remake it with the fresh, refrigerated salmon. I suspect they are using low quality scraps to make the takeout deal rolls in advance now, which is why they wouldn't make a new one for me with the good quality stuff on display. If this is the true then you are only getting rolls that have been sitting out for god knows how long, and I will not be going back. 

This is a real shame, up until today I really enjoyed coming here."}
{"text":"meh.

this place definitely has good service, but the food does not stack up strongly enough to be considered 4 stars like the current rating suggests. If this is rated 4 (and 5 by many) does that mean it is just one level below the absolute best AYCE sushi you have ever tried? come on, that's not true. 

what I ordered: AYCE

service: rated 4. super nice, they stole all the servers from sushi island, all great nice people. fast and friendly.

food: rated 3. yes there is very little rice on the rolls which is a good plus, some of the rolls are very unique (how about the sweet ones with coco flakes and with bananas?), but some of the rolls are equally disappointing because they fall apart and are tasteless... seaweed salad was good, miso was ok.. tempura and bbq was alright..

price: rated 3. good price, but still came to around 40-50$ total for 2 people.

overall: its an ok value, but I would not jump out of bed and get my underwear tied in a knot for this one..."}
{"text":"Great value and fast service. Quality is good for the price. Good all you can sushi place but don't expect top quality fancy authentic sushi. Nonetheless it is a great establishment and have visited it many many times; always happy."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi I've had in the city by far! The rice is always cooked perfect and they have a HUGE selection of rolls and other menu items to choose from.

Service is always amazing and the staff is super friendly.. and the food always comes out super quick.

Great location as well!"}
{"text":"We drove by and thought give it a try. We decided to go with the all you can eat. We ordered and the sushi rolls were big but they were big because the rolled it in lots of rice. I think they use this technic for all you can eat so you get full fast and don't order to much."}
{"text":"Ordered through Justeat.ca with 20% promo code. Ordered salmon sushi + sashimi set, tempura shrimp + egg + onion hotpot, and deep fried rock shrimp. 

Salmon sushi + sashimi set tastes bland and would have have been forgivable if the other 2 dishes I go were ok.

Tempura + egg + onion hotpot does not come with tempura shrimp?!? But instead with those frozen mini shrimp you find cooked frozen in the grocery store!?! :*( $10.99

Deep fried rock shrimp were the same frozen mini shrimp...not crispy but soggy in a water sauce?!? $11.99

So disappointed. It could have been a hit, ok or miss and this experience was definitely a miss. 

If it was any consolation, Justeat.ca offered me a $15 credit."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving low reviews but I'm having a hard time finding anything redeeming about this place. I paid $15.99 for a bento box full of disappointment - dry rice, chewy sashimi and enormous maki that was impossible to chew. The seaweed salad isn't even made of seaweed (more like collard greens?? I don't get it). Service was pretty bad as well, we didn't even have chopsticks on our table and had to ask repeatedly for them. 

Things that were OK:
- miso soup
- speed of service

Save your money"}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend for a good AYCE spot downtown Toronto. Our food came out super fast, and I was happy they served nice big pieces of sashimi (even if they were served a bit on the cold side)."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst place I have ever been to for AYCE sushi. A real horror story.

Now just to give you an idea - I have been eating sushi since I was 14 I am now 26. I LOVE sushi and always like to check out a new restaurant. My boyfriend is 6'4 and he eats A LOT so AYCE usually saves us some money. I don't expect it to be AMAZING but I do expect to get my moneys worth.

We were excited at the new prospect of AYCE sushi. I have eaten at about half the sushi restaurants in the downtown core and my tastes vary. Everything was horrible. Not one piece of sushi or maki roll did I enjoy. We forced it down so we would not have to pay for the wasted pieces.

When we ordered hot food it came out so fast my boyfriend actually stated that he thought it was microwaved. We got a grilled squid and a couple other items that seemed to take no cooking time at all.

Now my boyfriend he can eat anything normally. He worked around explosives a lot in the military and has a limited range or taste. I usually get him to eat foods that I don't like but even he could not stomach this sushi!

Needless to say that was the first time I ever walked away from AYCE sushi feeling hungry"}
{"text":"I was dying for sushi and this place was within walking distance of where I was and, more importantly, open at 4pm on a Sunday.

I had the sushi F combo. 2 pieces of tuna sushi, 2 pieces of salmon sushi and 8 pieces each of a dynamite and California roll, with miso soup and salad. I found the sushi a bit bland, I used a lot of soy sauce and wasabi. The only thing good about it was that the servings were pretty massive. I had to split into two meals.

Considering the amount of sushi restaurants in this city, I am not likely to return."}
{"text":"Previous experiences have been okay. Food like most AYCE restaurants is pretty mediocre. Service usually starts out great but after the first round of food comes they just disappear. Today when I went in they refused to do all you can eat at 10pm (they close at 11). I offered to make one order to take up as little as their time as possible but they refused.

Overall takeaway: staff are extremely lazy. Food is mediocre. Not worth going back."}
{"text":"Where do I start? 

First I'll note that we ordered off the menu, not the AYCE. 

The first thing we noticed when we sat at our table was how disgustingly sticky it was!  It looked clean but throughout our meal our plates were actually clinging to the table and took some force to lift them off. It was rather disconcerting. 

We tried to order drinks but they seemed to be out of almost everything and when our cans of beer did arrive one of our glasses had lipstick on the rim. When we sent the glass back we never did get another one to replace it. 

The wasabi wasn't fresh at all or very wasabi-like, and the soya sauce was incredibly watered down. It was rather gross. The food itself was mediocre and the fish was too chewy to be fresh but I have had worse sushi... barely... my friend had the sashimi and said it was fresh enough for her.

The service was okay and the servers were accommodating with the few requests we had, however the overall experience was rather sad. If you want good but affordable sushi I'd suggest going to Sushi X-tra at Queen and Spadina."}
{"text":"UGGH. Sashimi Island! I feel like we've been longterm on again/off again lovers. I've been ordering takeout/take away from you at least once a month for the past four years. I love you and I only keep my distance because I know I'd become absolutely obsessed with you.

But lately things have been a little strange between us. You've been aloof! A little impersonal. You seem off. You give me way less (soy) sauce. You taste different... and you're just not fresh. I'm not really as into you. What's happening between us?? 

Is this just a rough patch or do you have different priorities now?

Last time I ordered spicy tuna rolls, the tuna had a REALLY bad taste and I had to throw them out because I've had food poisoning from fish before and I knew not to go there. What's up with you? Baby don't hurt me."}
{"text":"Need to feed your face with decent sushi at a reasonable price? Then job done, here is the place for you! I can not see past the AYCE menu. $20 for everything, fantastic price for a great selection. 

The eats: Beef and garlic teppanyaki is really tasty. Great selection of rolls and the sashimi was good, generous sized and fresh. Loved the black dragon roll, the banana roll (proper name now escapes me) is interesting and pretty damn delicious.  Followed by choice ice cream, fried banana in syrup. If you ask they will give all broccoli tempura (which when you are dining with a few people who only want the broccoli pieces in the vegetable tempura is a good thing).  

The service: has always been friendly and fast! If I do recall correctly they will split the bill (for larger groups) without any real complaint, and even offer to do this!

The atmosphere/decor: Clean, simple, nothing too fussy. I suppose there is a sort of 'diner' sort of feel to the place....I say this because the last time I sat in one of the small booths.  Whenever I have been to this place it has not been overly busy, but for larger reservations I would book."}
{"text":"Sashimi Island sounds like a generic, mediocre sushi joint and that's exactly what it is. AYCE options for lunch and dinner - $16.99 or $19.99 depending if you want to choose from sushi and sashimi or nah. 

The quality of the food is O.K. at best. Chicken Kaarage is obviously re-purposed from their chicken teriyaki bits (more like popcorn chicken), Sashimi is on the verge of not-being-fresh, and everything else falls on the same path. Nothing great.

Service was good, kind and prompt. restaurant was surprisingly busy for the day and location IMO. But hit the sushi spot if that's all you wanted.

I wouldn't recommend Sashimi Island in my top 5, but it's affordable and filling."}
{"text":"I decided to give it 3 stars not because it's good but I figured out that for $5.65 I can get 16 pieces of avocado roll.  That's decent. I didn't like their other rolls but they have cucumber as well for that price. It's not the small rolls but a bigger roll with avocado so I figure out good for what it is."}
{"text":"The sushi has become inedible. The salmon tastes off and the spicy salmon is pre cut/pre mixed. You can see it sitting in the glass case with skin still on, different size cuts and brown coloured bits. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. 

The sushi was not appetising looking with lumpy over riced sushi rolls. We had to send the salmon roll back because it looked like they cut up any part of the fish with little regard for what it looked or tasted like.

Cheap all you can eat for a reason. I would only eat veggie rolls here but even that.

Also the sound of their radiator is louder than conversation.

Basically never coming back. Don't trust it or like it here at all.

I don't advise it."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places in little Italy for Japanese food. Not because the food is great but because the price is amazing.

They do sushi rolls for 5.99 to 7.99, and everything else on their menu is priced lower than the other Japanese places in Toronto. 

Today, i went with the all you can eat option for 19.99 which included sashimi. That alone makes it a great deal. They also have a whole bunch of other options too, so come hungry. The food is not the best, but if your not too picky with food like myself, there will be no complaints. It gets the job done and leaves you satisfied.

I definitely recommend this place. Best bang for buck."}
{"text":"Sashimi Island is a Canadian style Sushi restaurant on College.  They offer All You Can Eat AYCE) options and menu options.  The restaurant is somewhat physically accessible in the sense that one could get a wheelchair through the door, but getting to the gendered washrooms could be an issue.  This is because the hallway that leads to the bathrooms is VERY narrow, however, there are no stairs.

Sashimi Island is one of my favorite \"cheap\" sushi places.  They offer typical fare for an inexpensive sushi restaurant such as sushi, sashimi, terriyaki, bento boxes,and  tempura.  They have unbeatable specials in terms of lunch and AYCE.  They offer two different AYCE menus for dinner, one for around 20$ and one for 15$.  If you feel like having a full meal, as in soup, salad, appetizer and sushi rolls, then the 15$ meal is unbeatable.  

Last night, I went with my BFF.  I wasn't feeling 100% in terms of health, so I stuck to the a-la-carte menu.  I had a spicy salmon roll and avocado roll.  The rolls, in terms of style, are big, full of rice and pretty okay in terms of appearance.  I wouldn't bring someone here for a fancy meal, but rather to get their \"eat on\".  The food is good for the price."}
{"text":"Okay guys TLDR; AVOID coming here. Butchered sashimi, too much rice with the sushi, terribly seasoned food, and rude service. 

Sashimi island is disappointing. Avoid coming here for the all you can eat option. Not sure if getting their sushi a la carte is any better, only tried the AYCE. Don't get me wrong, for all you can eat for 19.99, I wasn't expecting too much; but for goodness sake it was beyond terrible. 

Where do I even begin? The salmon, white tuna, and red snapper sashimi were poor quality, completely butchered, and all had a funny after taste; we didn't even finish eating it. Never before have we seen fish so mistreated. I'm really hoping that the sushi chef was *not* professionally trained because his teacher would be rolling around in his grave...and if he were still alive, his face would be glued to his hands in a permanent face palm. The white tuna was extremely watery for some reason and tasted like it had been refrozen and thawed several times. Just gross. 

The sushi rolls and the individual pieces of sushi...let me put it this way. If I wanted to be inundated with rice, I would've bought myself a bag of cheap white rice and cooked it at home instead of paying to eat here. I might've been okay with the amount of rice if the had it at least tasted good...but it was completely dry and clearly unseasoned. 

We ordered fried udon and a seaweed avocado salad in addition to the sushi and surprise surprise, the udon was disgustingly sweet, the seaweed salad had a funny, acidic/almost alcoholic smell, and the avocado was overripe. 

Last but not least, the service. They had forgotten to bring out our eel rolls and hand rolls - after this experience I am so glad they did. And the worst part? The server and sushi chef were talking about us in mandarin thinking that we couldn't hear or understand them...surprise! We heard and understood every word they said. Here's a tip, if you want to talk sh*t about your customers while they're eating, at the very least make sure that they don't speak the same language. 

Bottom line - if a deal seems too good to be true, like all you can eat sashimi, It Definitely Is. 

Needless to say, I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"For value, service and freshness: Sashimi Island just can't be beat! My go-to for AYCE and take-out, hands down. Service is fantastic and each order comes out incredibly fast, yet care is always taken with the food. Crispy light tempura, inventive rolls, good-quality veggies (avocado is always creamy and perfect), and most important: always fresh-tasting fish. Especially love their volcano roll and black dragon roll, which we order every time. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I really like eating sushi and like the idea of an All You Can Eat place.  I have eaten at some very good All You Can Eat places and was definitely hoping for yummy deliciousness here. No such luck. I felt a bit misled by the three and a half yelp stars.

Here are the good and bad points, as well as a hopefully helpful fact or two....

1. The service is not bad. Food comes out fairly quickly. While the service is short of amazing, it is more attentive than many sushi places I have tried.
2. The sushi was not all that fresh. While I will grant that it is tough to maintain a super fresh menu when there are a gazillion choices on it, sushi that does not taste fresh does not taste good. Maybe limit the choices to what can be served fresh.
3. Other menu items such as lemon chicken and beef ribs were somewhere between average and slightly above average. The beef ribs were very fatty, but ok.
4. The BIG NEGATIVE is that this place is DIRTY. The restrooms were dirty. The walls by the booths had stains running down them. My feet stuck to the floor. There is thick dust on some ledges and vents. The place needs a thorough top to bottom scrub down.
5. Supper is $19.99, lunch is $13.99. You will get plenty, but nothing stands out."}
{"text":"Ugh. SO disappointing. A Wednesday afternoon for late lunch. One server who didn't acknowledge us when he came in and looked up. We walked further in, still no acknowledgement (he was dealing with a customer standing at the back, paying). He could have just said, \"Hi! I'll be right with you!\". Nothing. So we wandered in further. Finally he came over (there were only two occupied tables at that time) and we asked for a booth and he said we couldn't have it (there were still dirty dishes all over it). So we sat down and decided to get the AYCE (because it's a good price). So we ordered. Then we watched 6 plates of hot food sitting on the counter, as the only server there (same guy) walked past it FOUR TIMES carrying water or pop to customers who'd just arrived. My dining companion's miso soup and salad came after having to ask (after all of the other food had been delivered to the table). The salad looked like it had been leftover from another diner's meal. The rolls were falling apart (hunks of rice, not rolled properly, just fell onto the serving plate as they arrived). Disappointing. Don't come here if you want quality or good service."}
{"text":"More vegetarian options than many sushi places. Recently, their rolls seem less well-made than they used to be (i.e. now they fall apart easily), but it's still our go-to for sushi - especially delivery."}
{"text":"Was once a good all-you-can-eat sushi and sashimi restaurant but business/management has unfortunately changed hands. 
Everything we ordered tonight was stale and bland, including the wasabi. The orders were mixed up a few times (salad instead of miso soup, then tuna sashimi vs. salmon which was ordered). Even at the end of the night when we asked for one bill (as a friend wanted to pay for the group), separate bills came prolonging our awesome experience

I guess all good things must come to an end... What a shame :-\   Never again"}
{"text":"Wow. Inconceivably bad. AYCE is ghetto to begin with and we deliberately did a la carte in hopes that the quality would be acceptable. It was not. I fear for my insides after eating here and have shunned my friend who selected this place. 

If you actually enjoy sushi, and actually appreciate quality, freshness, portion sizes of sashimi, and the taste of food, avoid.

If ur looking to stuff ur guts and it's about quantity, or you're in an eating contest, then I guess do what you want."}
{"text":"I'm amazed at the quality of food for the price. The servers were friendly and professional. Food came out so quick we often have a full table of food while we were catching up.

I think the reason some people thought this place was dirty, which it is not really, is because of the decor. The decor is surely dated, colour tone throughout does give the feeling of being dirty. As for the table, it is treated wood table. The pain with the finish of these tables are that if there is any moisture between the table and the plate, they stick to each other like glue. When dry, it will also feel sticky. It is not because it is dirty.

Food wise, the grill stuffs are the sure winners. It is not that that the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are bad, just the hit stuffs are better.

The grill squid is perfect, the Urajiro, which is a Deep-Fried Mushroom stuffed with diced shrimp is so good went for second. Yes, the galbi is a little fat, but it's no worst than, probably better than, most Korean places.

The sashimi are not of the best cut, what do you expect, but they are fresh. With the turn over like they do, how can they not be?

I like the Snowing Dragon Roll, but my wife finds it just a little too gimmicky.

Oh, how can I forget the salad. The portions are huge!  The seaweed salad is not inundated with sauce, so the taste is just right. I love my Avocado Salad, because it is the seaweed salad topped with Avocado and sauce. Perfect.

For my wife and I, we will come back for sure, but likely to focus in the hot food menu...so many things we didn't try...."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT AYCE note: don't order MORE than you can eat or else you'll be charged regular price for the dishes that aren't finished. Most places I've been that do AYCE have small portions or weigh the leftovers but these guys do full-size dishes.

I didn't have a problem with quality of food or service."}
{"text":"I've only been here about 5 times but 2 of the 5 they gave me a meat dish when i ordered a vegetarian one, I've learned you have to check for yourself before you leave if you order takeout. Their prices don't make sense. Lunch and takeout is really well priced but it doesn't make sense to charge 16.99 for all you can eat dinner for one person, but 19.99 each if there's 2 people. Might as well sit at different tables and pretend you don't know each other to save 6 bucks. I think they do this because it confuses people to come inside and by the time they realize what happened it's too late. I'll probably come back because it's cheap for takeout."}
{"text":"We had gone to for a birthday dinner. Everything was going well until we got our meals. The server was very difficult to find and ask her a question. It wasn't busy there was probably two other tables. She wasn't very attentive, half way through our meal she was no where to be seen. We asked another server what had happened to a dish that we ordered, he said he'd go and check on it. Apparently our server had forgot about it and asked if we still wanted the dish. We decided to take it to go. We were fairly annoyed at this point because of the lack of service. When it came time to ask for the bill, it took a while to find someone who we could tell and then look for them again to tell them we needed the debit machine. It was very disappointing because I've been going to this restaurant since they first opened. It sucks to know that this experience has left a bad impression on my family since I had been raving about it."}
{"text":"I came in here with some friends a little while ago on a quiet weekday. It was empty for most of our time there with people occasionally coming in to pick up their take out orders.  The owner stopped and chatted with us a few times while we were seated to make sure everything was good. Nice guy.

There are 3 levels of all you can eat to choose from. The first is just maki and apps, the second includes dessert, and the third includes sashimi. I always feel like a fat bastard coming into these places, so I opted to go with the first option to lesson the feeling. It didn't work. We just randomly ordered things and ordered way too much. The food came out fast and furious, tasted pretty darn good, and packed my belly so much I thought it was going to burst. You know when you wake up with the hangover from hell, and there's a tiger in your bathroom, and you promise never to drink ever again?? That's what I told myself after eating here; I'm never doing AYCE ever again. You know, until the next time."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that their name sounds like the most fun level ever in Yoshi's Story, I had never heard of Sashimi Island before. In fact, i kind of just ordered on a whim via Just Eat and I have zero regrets. Usually delivery sushi is pretty terrible and I know what I'm getting into but this was not the case.

I went with the Maki Set D (15.99), the Sushi Set E (15.99), an Avocado roll (3.75) and the Tempura Appetizer Dinner (6.99). Yeah, its a lot of food I get it. Leftovers are fine. Stop judging me. It also came with 2 Miso soups and 2 Salads.

The Maki Set D was pretty good value. The Spicy rolls were the real winner by a hair compared to the green dragon roll. Both were big and fantastic. The unagi roll was also really good, but competing with two heavy hitters it didn't shine as bright.

The Tempura Appetizer Dinner was amazing. Usually ordering tempura delivered means me getting chewy deep fried awfulness, but the shrimps and veggies were very good. The squid rings weren't bad by any means but I wasn't that big on them to keep it 100 with you. Still ate them all in one sitting.

The Avocado rolls were good but its really hard to mess up an avocado roll. You just look at it and you ask yourself. Is there avocado? Check. Is it in a roll? Check. OK, then it is probably pretty good.

The real winner was the Sushi Set E, let me tell you about it. Huge pieces of sushi and INSANELY huge pieces of Sashimi. Granted, I like thinly cut sashimi as much as the next guy but sometimes you want to bite into a huge piece of salmon. Sashimi Island afforded me the opportunity to do so and I love them for it.

All in all, 9/10 and would definitely order from them again. Also, shoutouts to Sashimi Island for hooking up a huge container of soya sauce. I hate opening those little packages with my fat stubby fingers so you guys really did me a solid there. I feel you."}
{"text":"Cheap... pretty good service, but the food is below the average of sushi buffet you find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Okay quality with even better prices. Did the lunch takeout special: 2 rolls for $5! A friend and I both got dynamite rolls and they were pretty standard. I will be back to try their buffet."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp and experiencing Sashimi Island in person, I felt compelled to write a review.

I honestly don't know why several people have said it's dirty - we didn't see any indication of that at all. Instead, I actually noticed how thorough the servers were in cleaning and prepping tables as they turned over. We sat at the tables (booths were full) and had absolutely no issues with cleanliness at all.

The service really is some of the best I've seen in a sushi restaurant. We did AYCE on Friday, and weren't expecting the food to come out as quickly as it did considering it's a busy night, but we were wrong! Food starting hitting our table within 5 (!!!) minutes of giving the server our order. In fact, our handrolls and some sushi was on the table before our miso and salads. And they paid attention to the table, regardless of how busy they were.  I have to note that this was the first AYCE place that didn't skimp on the ginger and wasabi - and they even refilled them for us when they noticed the dish was empty. And they wished me a happy birthday when they overheard my fiancee and I talking. Now THAT is service!

As far as their options go, I was a little disappointed to see the limited choices for sashimi - salmon, white tuna, crab, mackarel, tilapia and tobiko were pretty much it. No Tuna, Tamago, Surf Clam or Unagi! But the portions were consistent, and of decent quality.  They really do shine on rolls, though. We really enjoyed the Firehouse roll, and the soft shell crab, and enjoyed the fact they were lighter on the rice than other AYCE joints on the strip.  We didn't end up getting any tempura, but both tables around us did - and they both mentioned how good it was. It's on my list for next time.

In all, this is a pretty solid sushi joint for both takeout and AYCE. It's got better rolls than Sushi Bon, and the service is miles better and more consistent than the laughable Sushi D.  The only thing they could do better would be to nick the Rock Shrimp recipe from Sushi D - the only reason to put up with D's mediocrity - then they'd be perfect."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in the city!  The sushi chefs are awesome and the food is fresh and done well.  Lots to choose from.  A bright, clean establishment with great service.  The reason this is my favourite is because of the many options on the AYCE menu, and the great food quality.  Sushi is great, grilled items are cooked nicely, fried items aren't greasy, and the homemade BBQ sauce is delicious.  They have soba noodle soup, grilled steak, and awesome dumplings.  I like to try new AYCE's wherever I am in the city, but I keep coming back to Sashimi Island because it's the best.  And their beer & wine prices are great!  They also have wifi.

We've also done regular menu and home delivery and had great experiences every time."}
{"text":"I think we found a new AYCE for peeps in DT.  Came just last night with some friends and we were told to try them out.  Now the person that was recommending it was a big time fast food connaisseur so we were ready to be tricked.  I mean, if McD's had an ayce nuggets offer, you bet your sorry butt (or my sorry butt for going) that I'm probably gonna be there once a month.  Buttt recommendations for sushi, ehhhh, we'll put it to the test.

So we got the usual, sashimi (salmon, white tuna, etc) and a ton of maki.  We also got a few shrimp tempura's and they were fresh, so a good start.  The salmon to me was pretty average, nothing special but they did serve them in good thick pieces.  So if you like salmon, you got exactly what you were looking for.  My friend enjoyed the white tuna which again I thought was pretty average, but once again some pretty decent size pieces.  To me the winners of the night, were definitely the MAKI.

The ones I would recommend are the Fire Scorpion Roll, which are two shrimp tempuras and yam with red snapper & spicy mayo on top.  I believe they torch the top as there's a little charring going on.  It's a warm smokey delicious maki roll.  The Fire House Roll was our second fav with a little banana incorporated into the roll.  And the third best, Snowing Dragon Roll.  I'll added the menu on the yelp page, so check out the other options.

Overall, yeah it's a little further but at $19.99 for ayce with pretty good quality, make the trip over.  Especially if you like maki like me, it's worth the trip.  MAKI !!!"}
{"text":"BEST AYCE!

If you are a maki/roll fan like me, you'll LOVE the AYCE option. They have three tiers, the cheapest being around $15 for just appys and maki, second tier including dessert(maybe?) and the third including everything mentioned PLUS sashimi. 

AYCE is best when it's big group, you can order more selection and get more bang for you buck. I usually opt for the cheapest tier because I'm usually just in a duo and want to feast on rolls. But the quality of service and food here is awesome. Timely services, quality sushi and they don't hound you to leave quickly like some snotty places (AJI SAI ON QUEEN W *COUGHCOUGH*) 

i always recommend this place for AYCE. So sooo soooo good!

{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews but this place was a big let down considering the reviews they have.  I came with a group of 4 on a Thursday night and were seated immediately.  Unfortunately for us the table we were given was so sticky that the cups literally had to be pried off the table!  No amount of cleaning by the waitress seemed to help so we were forced to consciously try keeping sleeves and elbows off the table for the whole meal.  The service was friendly enough but the food on the other hand was severely lacking.  Salmon was tasteless, the mackerel had to be forced down, and the sushi rice was too warm.  IMHO there are many other better options in the area."}
