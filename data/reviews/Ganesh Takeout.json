{"text":"I asked for chicken biriyani. They said they don't have it and then said they can make it for me. The server came in just after 2 mins and I wondered how he made biryani in just 2 mins. Then I saw him mixing a separately cooked chicken with yellow rice and called it biriyani. It tasted so terrible and we had to throw it away so much so that was so oily and too bad! It was a waste of money. They call anything with a chicken as biriyani!!! I wish I had given a ZERO STAR"}
{"text":"I have always past by this place everyday.  Yet, for some reason, I was never tempted to give it a try.  With Jennifer's review, I felt that Babu's up the road was certainly more worth my time.  On this particular day, however, I felt the urge to try something new. This place has been open for so long, despite Babu being up the road. They must be doing something right.  Arriving around 7, their chef was hard at work, refilling the tray and fulfilling take-out orders. The smell emanating was simply delicious.  It was not the most organized setup. One hot table, two display cases and the cashier counter. Various curries, roti, idly, puttu, dal filled buns, samosa, pattices, and other snacks filled the shelves. Prices for items were listed on the board above. At a glance, prices seemed comparable, and some lower, than Babu.  The lady behind the counter was very nice and inviting. She answered all my questions with patience and a kind tone, even when other guests seemed to be piling in behind me. Certainly a change from the curt responses I get at other places.  She even offered a couple of free samples of short eats that she could not describe fully; a welcome act.  All was tempting, but seeing as I still had dinner to attend, I got a few samosas, and a fried modakam. The modakam was delicious. The other crust was still crispy, but the dough was soft and tender, with a slight chew. The filling was of coconut and dal, mildy sweetened and very aromatic. I haven't had one this good in a long time.  The samosa were similarly good. While not big, the crust was crisp and flaky, and the filling well seasoned and spiced. The crust was not as thick as Samosa King's and not as thin as Babu's, but I like it better than either.  There was a good amount of spice in the filling, enough heat, and the potatoes were still distinct.  Very good.  I will definitely be back.  I am eyeing their rice thali, which is cheaper than Babu's. And if their samosas are any indication, I am sure the curries will be excellent as well.  Can't wait. For now, based on the samosas and modokam, and the kind attentive service, four stars."}
{"text":"We love this spot for Sri Lankan takeout and catering.  We ordered from Ganesha everything from snacks (mutton rolls, fish cutlets, meat/veggie patties/samosas), to dinner for two (dosa, string hoppers, pittu, plain and coconut rotis, rice and curry, and of course kuthu roti) to catering for 20+ guests at our place.  The owner has always told us, anything you need/want, must call at least 20 mins prior and he will make it for us.  On some items, the spice level can be varied.  Medium can be spicy for some :)  This place is small so I highly recommend you call first and place an order.  If you don't know what you want, just ask for suggestions.  My mouth is watering just thinking about their food.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If Sri Lanken and Indian food is what you're after - you've found the right place but....  You kinda need to figure out how this place works. If you've never been here before and if it's busy - you'll walk out after a minute after you walk in. There is no system, no way for anyone to know you were there first. No glimpse of a line up or any form of organization.   What there is though is delicious food.   My go to are the chicken biryani and the chicken curry and Roti.   So how to order:  The responsibility of knowing where you are place In order of arrival is squarely on your shoulders. If you don't know what place you are then I'm sorry - this place just isn't for you. You need to keep track of who arrived before you and who was there after.   The biryani is perfectly cooked and the chicken curry is perfectly spicy. The Roti is fresh and is delicious. Unfortunately my curry chicken was served a little cold but still tasted great.   All in all great food as long as you can figure out how to navigate the lines."}
{"text":"The Kothu Roti is one of the best in town! Always ask for it to be made with extra gravy for a good flavour punch! The mutton rolls are very crispy as well! Flavour is always consistent, which seems to be rare with many takeout places nowadays!"}
{"text":"Ganesh Takeout & Catering is facing really tough competition since it is just located less than 5 minute from Babu.   Just like other Indian/Sri Lankan takeout, there is no line. But I have no problem getting services because I stood out like a sore thumb.... the only one that didn't speak the language.   Curry Mutton, fried squid, eggplant, Curry mock vegetables and Sevai (thin rice noodle) was A-OK. Spicy and hot... my stomach felt burning warm the whole night.   The set up here is not as organized, the food selection is not as good as Babu... so if I have the urge for more Indian food, I would have just drive North to get my fix instead of here...   Sorry, Ganesh!"}
{"text":"Another take out place for Sri Lankan food. Samosas and mutton rolls are quite delish.  It's a small place. Can be quite chaotic when there is a line up (disorganised )"}
