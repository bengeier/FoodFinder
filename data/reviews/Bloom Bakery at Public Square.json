{"text":"Walked in today and felt very welcome. The service was terrific, I asked what all the sandwiches were made with and got explanations. The sandwiches were wonderful, the hospitality was wonderful and felt great. Definitely my new hangout spot to do homework and have lunch with friends. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wandering around downtown during the lunch hour I stumbled across the recently opened bloom bakery.  Tucked inside 200 public square in the old BP building (or the SOHIO building for those that really like vintage descriptors) it can be found on the ground level between Starbucks and US Bank.  I decided the next day that I would try it.

Bloom features both baked goods and sandwiches.  Sandwiches come on your choice of bread, along with a side (I opted for chips) and the ability to add a cookie for a dollar.  I went with the Catalan chicken on whole wheat, which was good. The cookie was excellent.  Not too soft, not too dry and fairly large.  Aside from this they also featured brownies, artisan donuts, and breads by the loaf. I may come back and give their chibatta a try.

I got my order to go so I could eat outside but there was plenty of seating inside.  The line was surprisingly small, considering the quality of the sandwich and the fact it was the lunch hour.  If you are looking to grab something quick, good and reasonably priced and want to avoid the lines at national establishments across the street give Bloom Bakery a try."}
{"text":"I am rating this place on the service alone, which was terrible so I did not get anything.  I stopped by during peak morning hours for breakfast.  There were only two other customers just in front of me ordering a variety box of pastries.  There were three employees behind the counter.  One was helping the customers and the other two were standing there.  I waited over five minutes because I was really looking forward to trying the food here, but finally I decided to leave because I didn't want to support a business that treated customers this way.  They won't be around much longer if they don't step it up.  I walked next door to Starbucks where I was helped immediately by a courteous person who took my order and told me to have a great day!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to Bloom in the morning or on my lunch break, I've been greeted by wonderful, considerate employees who seem genuine in their desire to make everyone feel important. Retha is the mom we all wish we had, and she does such a great job promoting the business. 

The seating area is clean and comfortable, the music is quiet and contemporary, and the bagels... oh my god the bagels. I go out of my way to make sure I get one in the morning and sing the praises to the baker. 

This is a great business with an even greater mission. TE has done so much for the city of Cleveland and it's wonderful to see how successful they have been so far. 

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Bagel was extremely tough to bite into, resulting in my eggs squishing out everywhere. I mat even have lock jaw now after having to chew each bite 20 times. It being early November, it would have been nice to have some heat rather than the air conditioning that was on making me freeze and want to leave in a rush. The coffee wasn't bad and I enjoyed the potato salad."}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast on a weekend and tried to order the yogurt and granola (sold out), then the orange juice (only had Orangia, not orange juice), then ordered the toast with butter and jam which was only one of 6 or so things on the breakfast menu.  I was give 4 thin slightly toasted pieces of bread in a bag with cold packets of butter and Smuckers apple jelly.  Every run of the mill deli, coffee shop, etc puts the butter on the toast.  And they charged me $2.95 pre tax.  And they had the nerve to tell me everything was made in house (granola, bread, whatever).  Smuckers couldn't be farther than homemade.  I did get a little attitude in addition to the toast and a latte which wasn't half bad.  Just don't charge people $3 for lukewarm toast and crap jelly.  Please."}
{"text":"Bloom Bakery. I see what you did there. ha. Gotta love bakers' humor. 

Pro tip: go early. 

I'm not sure why I thought I would find a complete selection less than 90 mins before close. It's my own fault. Since the cookies were gone, I went for the pair of danish in the display case. I appreciate the employee for letting me know one had raspberry and asking if it was ok because I didn't notice at all. The traditional cheese danish was underwhelming. It tastes like there is some sort of jam/puree/preserve in the pastry, which is great! The cheese filling was a little lackluster to me. The texture was weird. 

Oh, but the raspberry danish....Outstanding! The dough was perfect. Flaky and buttery with a slight crunch. The cheese filling was perfectly sweet and smooth without being too sweet and the raspberries were an excellent contrast. I was mad I ate that one first.

Service here is great. As it was nearing close, the employees were getting some cleaning done but they didn't make me feel rushed in any way.

Is Bloom worth a second trip? Absolutely, and I'll be sure to be early."}
{"text":"Bloom Bakery is amazing. I got really excited when I hard about this place because what could be better? A great cause, inspirational mission, and donuts. Yes, please! 

I finally stopped in for lunch with a friend and everything met my expectations. The staff was incredible, as was the smoked salmon sandwich and the beet salad. My friend I went with claims she doesn't like beets, but she liked that salad, so that's saying something. We stuffed ourselves and still went back for a dessert each. Her chocolate cake was decadent and delicious, but my key lime bar was better if you ask me. :) 

I can't wait to come back and relax with a donut in the morning or dig into another sandwich!"}
{"text":"Cute spot with amazing pastries and the only rude service I've ever experienced in Cleveland. I love the mission of Bloom, but some training and a better organization for the prep is needed. The wait was very long and the servers were disorganized at each point of service. 

My husband ordered toast and jam, and when the cashier asked for his choice of bread he was informed they did not have white bread (although it was listed first on the menu), so he asked for sourdough. Then he ordered us each mochas, but being out of chocolate syrup, the cashier offered us caramel instead.  It seemed obvious that the cashier was not interested in making anything for us because she was yawning and very short with us. With no mocha to dip into, my hubby cancelled the toast. He ended up choosing an almond croissant and a drink from the cooler. I opted for a house coffee and a pan au chocolate. Throughout the service the cashier's rudeness was undeniable. We felt like we were unwelcome at this cafe, so, despite the incredible deliciousness of the two pastries we had, we will not return to Bloom. 

Kudos to the people making the breads. Fantastic...the two stars are for you. I'm sad that one woman who can make or break this place isn't interested in its success."}
{"text":"I had heard such great things about this place and I was excited to try it, but I was quickly disappointed. First, the people working the counter took a while to acknowledge me and then seemed confused when I asked for a doughnut and also annoyed that I took a minute to look for what I wanted. Then, as I was eating the doughnut I found some blue dots on the bottom that I can only assume were mold.

So, if you want rude people feeding you expired food, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I popped in for breakfast this past Wednesday morning.  Their cash registers were having technical issues and could take cash only, which was not a problem, but I thought I should note the technical hiccup.  I ordered a vanilla latte, which was delicious, and toast and jam.  Though the staff were very friendly, it took a good 15 minutes to get my toast and jam, and then when it arrived, it didn't come with the raspberry jam I thought the board said was included.  Instead, I got two packets of Smucker's jam.....which I could have at any chain dining establishment.  However, I didn't say anything because I had already waited long enough.  The bread (wheat) was good though the edges were a bit burnt.  The bakery itself is gorgeous--impeccable decor and VERY comfortable/cozy.  I would eat here again just for the atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"Updating my review to say it is still five stars for me! Love stopping in and visiting the friendly staff every day."}
{"text":"Liked this spot. We stopped in during the RNC for a quick bite to eat and found the staff helpful and prompt. We loved the seed bread and almond croissant."}
{"text":"We stopped in to get a sweet while walking around Cleveland last Saturday. We got a chocolate croissant and jelly doughnuts. Both were delicious. However the best part of this bakery was the staff. The two young women working in there were so friendly and pleasant. They made us happy to be there! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this little bakery. I went three different times while in Cleveland for business and had a delicious breakfast of earl grey tea and fresh raspberry donut, an amazing choc ganache tart for dessert, and a yummy granola bar and coffee. The beet salad was definitely on point, especially after they added the feta that I asked for. I wish I had the chance to try the sandwiches, but that just means I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious croissants and cookies. The bread was fantastic. The design is beautiful. And I love the mission too."}
{"text":"I love it here, the food is good, the people who work here are so nice and helpful.The chocolate croissant is out of this universe, I've tried a few different things and it's still my favorite. If you go early in the morning they are stocked and packed but after 8am they seem to run low on certain menu items so to get the full idea of this place and all its scrumptious treats I suggest an early arrival. They have a nice atmosphere, a fireplace and couches, intimate tables."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Bloom. I was working in the building on one of the upper floors, and happened to notice the place when I came in. Always looking to try something new and not feeling Starbucks, I walked in. I was immediately greeted warmly by the two staff members working, and they were very kind in fielding my first-timer questions. In the end, I settled on a cinnamon raisin Danish and a cappuccino. When I went to pay, the cashier said, \"The pastry is on Bloom.\" Shocked, I said, \"Really!?\" She confirmed this, charged me for my cappuccino only, and sent me on my way. This incredible and unexpected display of generosity will not be forgotten by me! Not to mention the Danish and cappuccino were both DELICIOUS. The next time I am working in Cleveland, you can bet I will be back to visit the kind souls at Bloom."}
{"text":"Everyone at Bloom was so kind and friendly.  Their Mission is very important, helping find a way out of poverty for those in need.  Their Chocolate Croissant was so light and flaky with just enough bittersweet chocolate inside.  Their almond croissant is very tasty, too.  Their prices are so reasonable for the size of their portions.  The atmosphere is comfortable and it would be a great place to meet friends for an early morning coffee, or light lunch in the afternoon.  Next time I'm in downtown Cleveland, I plan on making a visit to Bloom.  Don't forget to grab some goodies to take home, too!"}
{"text":"Very cute bakery in downtown. Employee, Ritha, made me feel very comfortable my first time here as she went over the menu and drinks. Very welcoming place to go with many pastry options. Coffee is great too."}
{"text":"I loved the Vegan sandwich they have. The bread is absolutely delicious. Beet salad was good enough, I was looking for a more complex taste (I usually make it with hazelnuts and rosemary). Employees are friendly and helpful and the place is very inviting."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit to Bloom Bakery and I ordered the Coronation Chicken Salad sandwich, which was just ok.  The Coronation Chicken Salad is a curried version of regular chicken salad.  This version was a bit sweet, unlike my favorite version, at Stone Oven, and portion was small served on REALLY thin bread.  The sandwich comes with a side, I ordered chips.  I'm not sure that I would order sandwiches from Bloom Bakery, not enough bang for my buck at $8.95, I left still a bit hungry:-(   The baked goods are still spot on!"}
{"text":"Love the philosophy of this place and my salad was good, but it's a little pricey for lunch! I'll be back, but won't make it part of my rotation."}
{"text":"This review is for the Death By Chocolate Cake only -- the cake was very dry and too sweet. 

However, the service was so exceptionally warm and friendly! The cafe space is also clean and nice."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about the hour, so a friend and I went in on a Saturday around 1:45. We didn't know the restaurant closed at 2. We got out stuff to go and sat outside the restaurant in lobby of the Huntington building. The manager felt bad that we didn't sit inside the restaurant. She was super friendly and gave us two brownies which were really good. I got the BBQ chicken panini which I would gladly get again. Overall, now that I know the hours I will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome in every single way. Their baked goods are as good as it gets, on par with other Cleveland faves like Fluffy Duck and On The Rise. Of course, their mission (similar in some ways to that of Edwin's) \"to provide individuals with access to meaningful opportunities for work, achievement, & self-sufficiency through the art of exceptional handcrafted baking, thereby breaking barriers to employment & creating a pathway out of poverty\" makes this place even sweeter. 

While I don't get downtown often enough to be a regular, it's a go-to for a light lunch or a quick stop for coffee since it is so close to Tower City, located in 200 Public Square. As others have mentioned, the space is warm and cozy with lots of seating (outlets are available, but not omnipresent). 

Their croissants, breads, and sandwiches are great, and their soups are a hidden gem. As we speak, I'm downing a big cup of their meaty lobster bisque with a freshly baked baguette for only $4.95 and I'm in heaven. Lastly, the service here is always incredibly friendly and personable, and I always seem to have a good time and laugh, even while waiting in line.

tl;dr Heaven is a place full of croissants and lobster bisque called Bloom Bakery."}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop/bakery in the Gateway District. Two main reasons for me wanting to go here was I wanted a healthy option and I wanted a piece of carrot cake! 

The inside is \"cute\" with lots of seating and a little fire place which I thought was a nice touch. The staff was very friendly as well.

As for the food...

I had the chicken coronation on seeded bread. The sandwich was small but hearty, excellent flavor between the curry and raisins. It got messy because the bread fell apart with every bite. Unfortunately, for me there was no carrot cake :( so I asked the lady what she suggested and she said the cinnamon roll. I was rather disappointed as the roll was dry and hard which made eating it like eating paper. Once I got to the inside it got a little softer, had more potential if it was was heated up. 

Overall the experience was just ok. I think based on the other reviews that it's certainly worth another shot."}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods, sandwiches and fabulous service!! A must eat when in town. Charmin is a fantastic worker. She is so kind and helpful. My favorites were the Gouda, Salami, red pepper croissant, lemon madira pound cake and the curry chicken salad."}
{"text":"This place is really something special. Everything looks worthy of gracing the cover of a magazine and the staff is welcoming and cheerful. Social purpose/mission-driven, this establishment does a lot of good for the Cleveland community. 

I was warmly welcomed and opted for a strawberry danish and a breakfast sandwich. Both were superb--incredibly fresh with abundant flavor. It's obvious that there's a focus on high quality ingredients and thoughtful preparation. If I lived anywhere near Cleveland, Bloom would be a regular stop for me. What a treat!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to Bloom every since it opened. I love croissants and was excited to try their pastries.  I was disappointed with my recent visit. There seemed to be a lot of confusion that day, which led to a bit of a wait at the counter (no big deal at this point, it was the lunch hour).  Apparently someone ordered a salad but then they could not find the person. I saw staff taking this salad around the cafe a couple times before they concluded that this person had left.  Why is this relevant? You'll find out in a minute.

I wasn't in the mood for something heavy and decided to get the salad myself.  They began to offer me the \"mystery salad\" (ummm, I don't want leftovers), but then I reminded them that I wanted gouda, not feta cheese. The girl taking the order seemed to get it so I sat down at a table, feeling reassured that a fresh new salad would be made.

Our food was brought out and after a few bites, I see the hints of feta underneath....  Really?!?!  My first thought was, do you really think this tactic works?  Do you think you will actually pick out each and every piece of crumbly feta cheese from the salad?  And, is it really acceptable to be giving a customer a salad that I specifically stated I did not want?  I did address this with the employee in charge because the manager was not available (I'm sure they will be delighted to read this review).   I also pointed out to her that I may have asked for the switch due to a food allergy and that she could actually hurt someone.  She remedied the problem by refunding me my money and providing me with a coupon that I'm hesitant to use.

The croissant by the way was sub-par. Dry, not enough chocolate - I much prefer the frozen kind at Trader Joe's. 

The only thing saving this review from one star is that my husband's food was fine.

I hate to write about negative experiences, especially at an establishment that is trying to help people get back into the workforce.  I completely support that mission and am happy there are places like this.  However, I much prefer honesty over shortcuts and encourage management to review this with their staff."}
{"text":"I was here for an event, but liked what I sampled so much that I decided to buy some goods to take home! I went with the Chocolate Croissant and the Strawberry Danish. Both are huge and cost $2.95 each. Pretty sure the chocolate they use is the European variety so it has more cocoa and less sugar compared to the American kind; to me this makes it a little bitter tasting and so I was not a big fan of the croissant. (The bakery consultant they used was Maurice Chaplais, who is from England). The strawberry danish on the other hand I loved! It was made like a pinwheel and I would slowly pull off layers and dip them into the cream center. Mmm, but definitely a sweet and sticky treat though. 

The ambiance inside is very nice. There are chairs and couches you can sit on and relax by a small fireplace. I also love that Bloom Bakery is a non-profit that helps provide training and employment to low-income and disadvantage adults in greater Cleveland. That makes me want to support this place even more!

I will definitely be back to check out their other offerings like sandwiches and this filled donut I keep hearing about!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been here several times and the staff is always so friendly and enjoyable to talk to. I usually get the homemade granola bar, the catalan chicken sandwich (yum!), and the breakfast sandwich. Their food is so fresh and I love that they have vegan options to choose from. I hope this place sticks around downtown. So sick and tired of Chipotle and Starbucks, LOL."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I honestly think it may be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in the Gateway District, which is an odd thing to say about place that has the word \"Bakery\" in its name. Usually, I'd associate such a name with breakfast, and while they stay true to their name with plenty of pastries and yogurts, I still find myself drawn to the sandwiches and soup selection.

The menu is vegan friendly, which is a significant plus, but slightly limited. There is only one vegan sandwich, which is delicious, so maybe the limiting factor doesn't matter as much. However, the soups typically involve chicken in some capacity, and I feel like having a veggy minestrone of some kind would be beneficial here. With that said, the chicken & dumpling soup is also delicious. If you couldn't care less about vegan or vegetarian diets, I highly recommend it. The sides (you get to choose one with each sandwich, or can be selected a la carte) lend the meal a ot of variety. There is standard potato salad, all the way up to the more exotic fair, such as the quinoa salad (which is also amazing).

If you are on the go, takeout is available, but if you have time to spare I highly recommend dining in. The interior is pleasant to be around, and there is plenty of seating to go around. The staff is very friendly, and promptly brings your food to where you are sitting while you set up shop at your table of choice. They regularly patrol the area, removing empty dishes and mugs as you finish them off. Music selection is relaxed, and not so loud as to be overbearing. The volume level is perfect.

With an impressive variety of breads, pastries, drinks, and other treats, this place has a little bit of something for everyone. The prices are modest, and the food doesn't make you feel guilty after eating it. Did I mention that it is delicious? Because it is. Give this place a go, and I promise that you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is really great.  I had the almond croissant, which was crunchy, flakey awesomeness.   The latte was nice and hot and the milk was velvety.  The best thing is the friendly staff.   Just a gem."}
{"text":"I YELPED to find a close bakery to our hotel and Bloom Bakery came up with 4 & 1/2 stars.

HL and I walked over and waited in line to place our order.

I noticed only one almond croissant was left in the bakery case. HL ordered a breakfast sandwich with turkey bacon, egg & cheese on a scotch bun and I of course got the last almond croissant.  

While we were waiting to order we heard the guy behind the counter tell the person in front of us all the bagels were sesame - not true there were two kinds of bagels in the case.

I realized when placing my almond croissant order this employee had no idea which was an almond croissant until I pointed to what I wanted too.

The whole ordering, paying, receiving your food order process is flawed.

HL waited forever to get his breakfast sandwich. 

We noticed no one was getting the food they ordered because the manager or owner was using a cassette burner with a frying pan on top to make each individual order! Now I could tell her this doesn't work when people are lined up and those who are on their way to work don't have an extra 20-30 minutes to wait for their to go order.

The whole ordering process was back wards and HL and I felt simply didn't make sense.

For one thing, not training your employees to know which pastry is which and not to know bagels are not all the same kind, and the person at the register ringing us up was completely clueless as to what our food and drink order was absolutely nutso!

This place has no system in place and even if their food is good, I just don't see it making it!

This place was chaotic and not a relaxing morning experience for us while we were on vacation."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on my lunch hour for something quick and new. Many of the items on the menu sounded so good that I had a hard time choosing, so I asked the cashier what her favorite sandwich was, she suggested the Catalan chicken on scotch mist roll. I decide to take it to go and eat at the new public square park. The sandwich was fantastic, I took a menu and brought it back to my office so we can use Bloom to cater some of our events. I will definitely return to try more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since it has opened and have loved every visit. The staff is friendly, the cause is admirable, and the pastries are to die for. Have yet to find an almond croissant in the city that compares. Everything always tastes fresh and delicious, I don't know why you would bother with the microwaved breakfast sandwiches at the Starbucks next door when you can have something cooked in front of you. The only potential downside might be the price, but I'll gladly pay a bit more to support such a great mission."}
{"text":"Bloom Bakery gives me all the feels. Not only do they have an excellent artisan European bakery, but most awesomely...their goodies are prepared by those on the pathway out of poverty.

You can enter this surprisingly glamorous bakery right off Euclid Avenue or through the 200 Public Square building. This space is HUGE. With a small fireplace, bright colored walls and comfortable seating, you could easily spend hours cozied up in this bakery. I also love that all the tables have small sugar bowls and coffee accoutrements. It's a really nice touch.

Their standard of service alone deserves a million stars. I purchased a small glazed donut and key lime tart to go, and the staff was incredibly helpful. I came at an off time, yet they were still truly delighted to help me and strike a conversation, despite the bakery being a little picked over (good sign!). Their suggestions were spot-on, and the key lime tart was literal perfection. Can't wait to try this place again in the daytime, when the selection is a little more plentiful!"}
{"text":"I come to Cleveland on occasion for work and always stop by Bloom. I love the sweet people behind the country, the yummy bagels and pastries and the abundant seating. If it's nice out, sitting outside is great for people watching, but the indoor seating is cozy on a rainy day too.

I'm disappointed today that some group of about 10 has rented out the entire downstairs so there is no public seating. It's sunny so I don't mind being outside but there is no reason they couldn't have used only a part of the space, or why Bloom couldn't have brought some of the unused chairs upstairs to allow people to sit inside."}
{"text":"YESSSSS, BLOOM BAKERY. I was so excited to try this place, a great bakery with a great mission- & a great addition to downtown! Have I used the word \"great\" enough? OK, great. 

They have a limited amount of pastries to choose from - it's not some giant, sprawling place - but everything they do have looks like pure art. It all looks borderline fake, like it's a photograph in some rustic furniture magazine, or something, set atop a handmade burnished oak dining room table or something. Does that make sense? IT'S ALL GORGEOUS-LOOKING,

Luckily, it all seems to taste just as good. On my first trip, I bought a plain croissant, two molasses cookies, & a savory scone (can't remember what was in it, but definitely sun-dried tomatoes & some sort of cheese). I tried them all over the next 48 hours, & even not-quite-fresh-anymore, they were delicious. The molasses cookies are chewy & rich; the croissant was flaky & decadent; the scone was salty & soft, everything bursting with flavor. 

10/10 would eat every single pastry again. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place does not have a very extensive menu, but it hit the spot. I was able to get a late breakfast here of a very delicious yogurt parfait with excellent granola, plus very good banana bread. And the latte was very delicious. A great alternative to Starbucks next door, not to mention Pour down the street, if you want a delicious latte rather than a pour over."}
{"text":"Lovvvvvvvve!! What a great addition to downtown Cleveland. Amazing and roomy space. Extraordinary employees. Fantastic and very admirable mission. And the desserts. Ohhhhhh the desserts !!
Stopped in on a workday lunch hour and picked up a chocolate croissant, a couple triple chocolate brownies, and a white chocolate raspberry muffin. Everything exceeded my expectations. The brownies were so decadent (I chomped mine right down; I brought one back for a co-worker and he raved about how decadent his was and he saved half of it to savor the next day.) perfect texture, perfect taste, and pretty darn big.
The chocolate croissant was so flaky and delicious. For real, transported me back to My visit to Paris last summer. Pure perfection. I'm not a big fan of white chicory, but wow, the white chocolate raspberry muffin was so moist, flavorful and delicious.
I'm super looking forward to more lunchtime jaunts to Bloom."}
{"text":"An excellent addition to a lacking downtown café market, Bloom is both a community outreach initiative and a nice alternative to Starbucks for a light lunch and some much needed caffeine. The bread is the main attraction and it is pretty sublime in nearly every incarnation (the desserts especially, are decadent without being overly sweet), though I wasn't completely impressed with an overly soft ciabatta roll. Overall, the sandwiches themselves are relatively slight--don't go expecting a mammoth hoagie ala Dave's Cosmis Subs. This is an effete establishment, favoring class and culinary excellence over the pursuit of satiation. The space is pretty sterile tonally (rather harsh overhead lights), but beautiful. The staff are friendly and seem genuinely happy to provide you their fresh-baked treats. Worth a look for anyone looking to escape the regular downtown lunch hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Very friendly service and a nicely-designed, bright, & spacious place. 

FULL STORY: Would be more convenient if you work downtown... but I've stopped by in the afternoon have been met with friendly, welcoming service.  I usually have tea (they have a decent selection of Harney & Sons teabags - nothing fancy, no loose leaf), though apparently they focus on baked goods. 

Food-wise I've only tried the homemade granola bar, and it's pretty indulgent!  Super thick, soft, and chewy -- it's full of oats, seeds, and dried fruit, a little spicy, and very sweet.  Probably good to share!  No idea about other food or service issues mentioned in some other reviews.. sounds like they may get overwhelmed w/ high volume. 

I'm guessing it gets busy at times, but seems pretty calm and quiet late afternoon.  Lots of seating options (tables, couches, armchairs, benches)... and looks like they have a decent salad/sandwich menu too.  

Note: Easy to miss -- It's across the street from Chipotle.  One side opens out to street, other side opens to inside an office building thing."}
{"text":"Great bagels, doughnuts and pastries. The ladies who work there are also the sweetest."}
{"text":"Delicious oatmeal raisin cookie. Cute little spot and decor. Nice little place to sit and chat over coffee or lunch."}
{"text":"Great cause! Great space! Great service! Great food!  ... Such a great addition to the downtown lunch scene, and the comfy couches and seating is perfect for coffee and sweets. The best flippin' coleslaw I've ever had too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar salad and a small side of potato salad. The potato salad was amazing, probably the best potato salad I have ever had. The Caesar salad was equally as amazing, everything on the salad was extremely fresh and the made in house dressing was perfect. You can tell everything is made fresh daily. I will definitely be ordering from here again. FYI: Skipthedishes delivers from this place. Amazing."}
{"text":"Third trip to Bloom and I just love it. The first night we had an event there so I got to try a lot of things...tuna salad, coronation chicken, chocolate croissant, almond croissant, Cole slaw and more. It was all good. 

Visit number 2 I went with the tuna salad on wheat bread with coleslaw. It was really good. One of my friends ordered her sandwich on a baguette and it was huge.

Today, I tried a custard donut and got a chocolate croissant again.

The chocolate croissant is still my favorite. 

Love the food and mission!"}

Granola Bar and Brownie Sample
Almond Croissant
Cinnamon Roll
Carrot Cake
Peanut Butter and Jelly Beignet
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie

Located in Downtown Cleveland, the monument-centered traffic circle just outside its doors and to the right, Bloom Bakery on Public Square is not just an Artisan Café built to serve the city's business denizens, but also a social experiment - the non-profit \"Towards Employment\" and Chef Maurice Chaplais combing the idea of a restaurant with the ideals of teaching people job skills that can lead to career advancement.

Located in a large office building adjacent The Arcade, street entry from Euclid complimented by an indoor storefront accessed from East Roadway, patrons entering Bloom Bakery are quickly greeted by several cheery faces, a half-dozen or so daily breads offered in whole or as part of a sandwich while tempting baked goods line a pair of glass cases.

Offering samples of a Granola Bar in the morning, some small bites of a fudgy Brownie put out as the lunchtime crowd lined up later, it was with five items that a mid-morning snack was crafted, first bites of the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie seeing a pudding-soft center surrounded by crisp edges before taking a taste of the Cream Cheese Frosted Carrot Cake, the majority of a moist and aromatic wedge saved for further indulgence later that night.

Focusing now on items best consumed fresh, the Weekly Special Beignet unfortunately a bit doughy despite good Peanut Butter and Jelly filling, better bites were found in two laminated options, the Almond Croissant featuring yawning caverns around a core of pureed Nuts and no Frangipane while the Cinnamon Roll was a tightly wound coil of perfection, the exterior literally crackling to the tooth while the interior was soft and butter-soaked with a whole lot of Cinnamon."}
{"text":"A good bakery with an even greater cause.

The mission of this bakery is just incredible. It provides jobs to those who are disadvantaged or low-income (Towards Employment), and on-top of the incredible mission the breads are actually very good!

We've been wanting to try Bloom for a while (they have two locations- one in public square, and one in CSU campus), but just due to the times or business of life, we just haven't had a time to stop by there until this past weekend.

We decided to stop in for lunch. They have an assortment of breakfast pastries available and even breakfast sandwiches- but we stopped in during lunch time.

He got the smoked salmon sandwich with Scotch Mist bread and beet salad. It was delicious- and that BREAD! The Scotch mist had some of the softest bread ever that you could just sink your teeth in..... oh definitely go with the Scotch Mist bread when you're in there!

I got the catalan chicken and sourdough- the sourdough was very very good. The chicken was just okay, in my opinion, but it was very moist, which made for a nice chicken salad. I also got the beet salad- which was a nice fresh beet salad- plus the onions in it made for a nice touch.

A great cause, great carbs, and great location- just stop in and sink your teeth into the yummy goodies that are there!"}

Its a bit on the pricier side just barely undercutting their next door neighbor and competitor, Starbucks. Also the gentleman who I spoke to, who was the manager, was not very keen on giving me a pastry list for a bulk standing order. I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today, drawn in finally by the sidewalk sandwich board that I always walk past. Today the board advertised a turkey on baguette special of the day. 

The bread was delicious and in and of itself added a lot of value to the sandwich. It had a thin, but crispy crust covering a nice thick layer of bread. Between the baguette was turkey, smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and a nicely chosen ingredient - cream cheese.

The pastries in the case all looked overwhelmingly delicious. I've previously tried the pecan bar. It was gooey, delicious and the portion was generous.  

The interior is comfortable. There's a small seating area on the main level. On the lower level, with access to the Huntington Building, there's a fireplace, tables and a window high top table. It's very nice to have another downtown spot to use as a work space away from home - especially one that is not just open on weekdays."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. I travel to Cleveland a lot for work and have been very eager to try all local places (I'll skip Chipotle's consistency if it means I get to support a small business!), so when I found out that this place is only a half mile from my office, I was excited to go.

First, the bakery is really hard to find. I didn't see anywhere that stated the bakery is located inside a large corporate office. You have to go inside what looks to be a parking deck in order to find it. Once inside, though, it's lovely - clean, nice amount of seating, and it smells great. And, you're greeted as soon as you get to the counter; the people seem really nice and hardworking. 

I ordered the \"continental\" - literally salami and aged gouda on whole wheat bread. It's not toasted, has no toppings or condiments. I specifically asked how long it would be before confirming \"here or to go,\" as there was already a group waiting. The woman at the register said they were a bit behind, but still should only be about 8 minutes. I was fine with that.

22 minutes later, I'm just receiving my sandwich. In those 22 minutes, I saw 3 or 4 people bring their meals back to the register; I was out of earshot so I'm not sure if the order was wrong or perhaps not to their liking, but that was discouraging. I checked my sandwich before I left and it was made correctly... but eating it now, I'm not overly impressed. Sure, it's a simple sandwich - how fancy did I expect it to be? But the bread is sort of dry and the salami and cheese are warm. But, it didn't break the bank - only $10.25 for the sandwich, a bottle of water and a bag of chips. Coming from NYC, that's a steal. Good overall value.

I'd be happy to try them again given the great cause it supports (helping people get out of poverty by providing a job path), but I may go during off-peak hours as to not wait that long for another meal. I did overhear that they usually have more people behind the counter and so, maybe they were just short-staffed...but as someone who was rushing during the short lunch break, I was upset to wait that long for what I ordered."}
