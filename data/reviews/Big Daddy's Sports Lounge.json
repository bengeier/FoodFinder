{"text":"I really like this place! I have come here twice now. Once for lunch and once for the Sunday breakfast. I have never been disappointed or left hungry.   If you are coming for lunch I would suggest any of their freshly grilled burgers. They use a quality beef. But the magic is in the buns. I'm not sure if they are made in house but damn they are fresh. My bun was moist and soft. The fries are great too! They always come out fresh from the frier.  I really suggest trying the breakfast. It is not really that well known about and it is usually pretty quite around breakfast time. I got the chicken fried steak. This is probably the only place in Phoenix you can even get a chicken fried steak for under $10 and not be super disappointed after.   Great place and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"A bar experience I'd expect.  Good service, drinks, and Fantastic cheese curds.  The rest of the food was good enough.  We went here because of a yelp deal and will probably return again.  Probably won't order the pizza or wings but plenty big menu to try something different.  Also some how, I was gifted four pretty sweet beer glasses based on my bar order.  Thanks Big Daddy's!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  We are not typical sports bar types,  but this is no typical sports bar. We have adopted this place as our regular neighborhood favorite.  The staff is so warm and friendly.  And they dish out insanely good food.  Try the pizza, beer in the crust, I'm told.  My wife loves the hot dogs, while I'm partial to the Rueben.  The chips are cooked in house.  Also, pretty good daily breakfast special, which is awesome any time we don't feel like cooking!   Did I mention how reasonable the prices are?  Nice selection of brews and all the sports viewing your eyeballs can absorb.  OTB is there,  I've never tried it but it looks like fun."}
{"text":"Pretty nice dive bar actually! I liked that they had so many dart boards and enough TV's to satisfy your football craving. The food was good, simple and well priced. I would highly recommend they have an additional waitress/bartender for the football crowd.  While it was not busy when we arrived, it slowly picked up and we had to walk up to the bar to ask for another drink and our check, and I believe the owner was sitting down the entire time? We will be back again though!  On a side note-I would not recommend this place for a ladies night , definitely bring a man or 2 with you!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday wings. Sunday football. Good service. Always a pleasure to have dinner or lunch here."}
{"text":"The bartenders/servers are super fast and friendly, the prices are low.  Surprisingly they have really good food, I suggest a burger and cheese sicks."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Beer is cheap and so are the wings. Have been there 10 times or so and big daddy says hello everytime. Everyone is very welcoming. Their food is also amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Bartender was hilarious, she was extremely  busy but managed to always have my drink full. I came in after a bad day at work and am having a blast. Looks like they have a Texas hold em game going.  Will definitely be making this a regular spot. Wonderful deep fried mushrooms. I have to come back when I am hungry to try the rest! !"}
{"text":"I just wanna say .  The owner saved my ass!!!! Inlaws flew in from Mexico City to be with there daughter .. Came to fine out my father inlaw wanted to see the World Cup!! We have no tv service at hm, and as soon as we got hm. He was pissed of thinking of not watching the games. So, just drove around near are house .. Sure enough this place was open at 9am.. Lol  Father inlaw jumped out of the truck and rushed into this place.,  he said.. Yes!!!!! They have the games on!! So all of us went in,thinking it was going to be boring..not at all!! Crown royals,lg beers,chicken wings( chicken wings taste much better on the grill!!!) and hamburgers we were sitting on the far left side were the games were not being watched on.. Only on the right side, I asked the big guy if he can switch the games on the left side(but in Spanish) he said no problem.. 4mins later.. We had both games on are screens.. We went all week to watch the games. Awesome place...great fast service !!!  Thanks big guy!!"}
{"text":"There was what looked like a tiny baby roach on the part of the bar that catches the splashing booze. We just went for hanging out at a dive bar, not for the food (luckily!). Trivia was ok--they have the handheld things that interact with the TVs there. The bartender was nice."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars for the food and the wonderful bartender. We went wed morning and they had half off burgers. Make their own buns as well and they are wonderful! Have been twice for breakfast, good mimosas, good breakfast,but the burgers were phenomenal! Wonderful char on the fresh meat and many to choose from. We have been to the burger battle 4 times and their burgers would hold their own there. And half off burgers on wed and sat plus 10% off for checking in on yelp. Only caveat was a man yelling about the ordering of milk and other products LOUDLY! We assumed he was either the owner or the manager, either way,completely inappropriate in front of customers. Open for breakfast early with the whole menu available, we will definitely return. Just could do without the yelling at 8 am. UPDATE: We went back the next week and the owner bought our first round and apologized. Looks like this will become a regular stop for us in the morning. We also plan to check it out on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week.  I usually am there to watch a game on one of the many tvs.  Every time I have been the waitresses have been fantastic, the food great, and it is always a great atmosphere to watch a game in."}
{"text":"We frequent Big Daddy's. Sports bar food is supposed to be good. Here, it is great. Huge variety and mostly \"homemade\" and fresh. Their bread is made daily and is really good. You can't go wrong with the burgers (2nd quarter, 1/2 pounder with all the trimmings-my favorite for under $5! Wednesday and Saturdays) 3 kinds of fries, and the deep fried mushrooms are delish. How about a 28\" pizza and wings? Big Daddy's specials are the bomb! Lots of cold beer and yep, lots on draft. You can watch 25 TV's, games you can't get anywhere else (PAC-12), OTB and much more. Oh, they cater too."}
{"text":"For the 2nd time, I went in looking for a specific game.  They seriously went out of their way to find the channel and the game.  I was shocked!  I couldn't believe they made the serious effort.  CRAZY HAPPY to find a sports lounge that really wants you to be able to catch the game you want to see!!!  Food is good bar food.  I will need to try the pizza.  Service is awesome!  Beer is cold,"}
{"text":"The wife and I haven't been in since football season last year.  Came in tonight for Monday night football, the place was empty.  Didn't take long to figure out why.  No Monday night happy hour.  No happy hour any day of the week.  .60 cent wings is not gonna keep us coming back.  We will come back if they bring happy hour back.  Great place to go, but not worth the cost when there are so many other sports bars that want our business."}
{"text":"We were optimistic about trying this place out after seeing the great reviews. They had a yelp deal so we figured we'd try them out. We walked in and seated ourselves as the sign instructed. Waitress approached a few minutes later, we let her know that we found them through yelp. She seemed indifferent to the statement, not saying much. Just not very friendly at all.   They have some cool specials throughout the week. It is Tuesday $1 tacos today. The taco picture on their homemade menu made it look like an authentic stuffed with meat, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. So we ordered some along with onion rings. Onion rings were great, tacos literally had about a teaspoon worth of meat...no, I don't think it was that much. In any case, we showed the waitress, but it seemed as though she took personal offense. We asked kindly for her to take them away. No apology or customer service stars here. After we shared some onion rings, we asked to order some burgers. When she brought them, they looked great (and they were) but she came back a couple minutes later and said something along the lines of \"is that better, are THESE ok\"? Like we were just difficult customers for being underwhelmed with the poor tacos.   We're big on customer service, this place didn't have it in our book. Food was decent though. However, we can find decent food elsewhere with much better customer service. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Lurking within this dive bar is a FANTASTIC PIZZERIA.  House made sauce, pies as big as 26\" perfect for parties and wings that my family loves.  they have pizza and wing specials - good prices and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Cold beer, great food and fun environment!  Dart boards, pool table, and OTB too!  Always playing all the games."}
{"text":"First I wanted to give it 5 for service alone, because Jennifer the bartender is amazing and spot on, makes wonderful drinks. But I had so so food my first experience so hence the one star missing. I really had fun here last night, it was empty but Jennifer made it worth the visit. The in house bloody Mary's are BOMB, her Scooby snack and lemon drop ON POINT. I got to control the jukebox and pool table, they have darts and a nice secret patio with a tv and music. Overall for a little hole in the wall this place is a gem and ill def be back for a drink!"}
{"text":"Everything you've expected they are, they are. Pretty good bar food at great prices. I happened to stumble in on some sort of anniversary for the place, so there was loud music and people everywhere. Good vibes."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance of my new neighborhood and a weekly staple in my home! Delicious food, lots of specials, local beer, sports aplenty and friendly people."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast and they also have off track betting and pool tabs. Good prices and portions."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think of a bar as a great place to have breakfast, however this place is absolutely amazing. The menu is rich with options, and the food is absolutely delicious. Plate cleaned."}
{"text":"I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good."}
{"text":"This has become our once a week regular spot. Friendly bartenders, decent food and very good drinks. They even have an alcohol ice cream bar. Place includes dart boards,  pool and a decent music playrr. There is also OTB on site."}
{"text":"I've been here several times - some days it's packed and other days you'll only see a few regulars. The biker crowd seems to like this place and the sports fans of course. The owners are very nice and friendly and it seems they practically live at this place.  The drinks are priced good and they have some nice breakfast specials too. The pizza is really good as well. We ordered the super jumbo pizza for my husbands birthday and it barely fit in the trunk of my car - if you want the WOW factor at a party; order one of these. I posted a pic of my husband holding one of the monster pizza's so you have an idea of what to expect."}
{"text":"Unbelievable burgers, fresh hand formed burger patty on a freshly toasted bun. Mixed drinks in mini pitchers! I love it! Wish we had a place with this much going for it in Las Vegas! Way to go Big Daddy's!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I started coming here and cannot get enough of this place. Ice cold beer, and great food.   We recently found out they did catering and the food was phenomenal! We used their catering service and it was flawless."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar to just relax, unwind, and get a good meal at a good price. Open for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night fun. Food is consistently cooked, Big Daddy (Dave) is friendly, (often) present, and hosts great parties, game days, and local charity events to raise $ for individuals and the community in which he does business. The band he booked for the 2014 Christmas Party at the restaurant/bar was insanely talented, and the digital jukebox is good when I just have to play a song. I don't shoot whiskey,  shoot darts, play poker, bet the horses or dogs, curse, or drink alcohol, but if I ever want to do these things, I could at Big Daddy's.  I do love watching sports, great service (nice people), and convenience/value and I always get it here. I highly recommend stopping in, and with the money you save on half price burgers w the purchase of a drink on Wednesdays and Saturdays or with the Yelp promo, you will enjoy leaving the excellent waitresses and bartenders a larger tip (seriously, they are worth it!) -                    Yaniv Y (loyal and local customer and a big football and basketball fan)"}
{"text":"A while back, I had tried the meatball sandwich and remember really enjoying the sauce so when the opportunity presented to watch the Super Bowl, walking distance from home, and enjoy a pie, I was all about it! Let me just say: Remarkably good pizza for a divey sports bar! Our server was really nice and the prices are great!   They're a fun bunch, too! Super Bowl festivities included a pool, and food and drink specials based on the game (see uploaded photo). In addition to $6 mini-pitchers of beer, we indulged in ASU girl shots which are awesomely served in a pee cup! There's always the opportunity for off track betting here and, it appears from the tables stacked in the bathroom, an occasional poker game."}
{"text":"Always friendly!!  Always great food!!  Denise is always there and is a great ambassador  for Big Daddy's"}
{"text":"Big daddy runs a tight ship and the service is great. The food is good bar food and comes out fast. They also make great drinks from mixed drinks to a cold beer. The atmosphere is just an average bar with a lot of tvs on the walls all around. Big Daddy's is a huge asu bar and they have off track betting. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Big Daddy's.  But recently, the food quality (mostly the burgers)is not the best and the service is friendly, but very, very slow."}
{"text":"The owner is an East Coast and ASU guy and is a riot. Bartenders are nice, service is good, sometimes can get a bit slow when it's crowded but that wouldn't drive me away., They have bands playing there now on occasion and that seems to draw in a crowd. Oh, and did I mention they have $1 jello shots?"}
{"text":"This is an ok place to hang out.  They have great tv's, pretty good food and off track betting that I have tried a couple times.  This is a Browns bar and While a Lions fan I do root for the Browns.  It has a much more local feel to it.  The staff has very limited turn over and I went there about 5 times in November but when I went back about a month later the bartender asked if I wanted a Blue Moon which is my favorite.  That is pretty neat."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is always delicious.  My favorite is the Time Out turkey burger.  You can order it with just about any topping, as with all the burgers.  I get it with jalapenos and American cheese.  The buns are soft yet grilled so you bite in and it smushes down with your burger just right.  My boyfriend enjoys the ribs, sandwiches, chicken strips, fries and whatever special is on the board.  Another bonus is the new gaming tablets from Buzz Time.  We played some free poker with others across the bar while we ate at our table.  It was really fun to have a game at the table while eating.  We plan on doing the Trivia next.  The beers are always cold and there is a good selection on tap.  Employees are friendly, prices are low, and you might even spot Big Daddy himself there mingling with the customers who are also really easy going and welcoming."}
{"text":"Let me Start with the Good...wings & brats. Draft beer less than $4 . we were there on the Sunday of NFL semi final playoffs.  There was a group of about 30 that were having a meeting.. REALLY?? In the middle of football!! Shame on the owner, Dave, who was there, to allow this to happen. They could have came earlier than 1, before the game started...but right in the middle of the first half they hold their meeting..the TV's are turned down & we're all talking in  \" inside voices\"..in a sports bar!!! And the person holding the meeting had the. audacity to say \" give us 5 more mins ...it's only a football game!\"  Shame on you Big Daddy!"}
{"text":"Great wings and great service, was worth the time to check it out, and they had Stella on tap!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat a burger and watch the games. Also play the horses.  Good place for friends and fun !!!! Friendly people working there too. Love watching cardinals there !"}
{"text":"Bummed out for sure. I'm on the hunt for a good sports bar next to my man's place and tried here today. Utter disappointment from the get go.   We were the fourth table in the place on a Sunday at 2:40. Walked in sat ourselves and the wait began. First waitress comes by with menus. Then about 8 minutes later a second waitress to take drink orders.  Says I have to run food I'll be back. That turned into 15 minutes.   We happen to notice(because literally there's 12 people there not staff) that every time these three ladies do anything it requires a 4-8 minute conversation behind the bar with all three of them.   Food comes out and for some reason she thinks we've ordered two fried pickles along with the cheese curds wings and burger. Crazy lady. Oh well who cares. Food is hot and what I expected.   I did order a beer to go with my wings. A small draft. That took 9 minutes. No keg change I watched. I just don't get poor service.  Too bad that my search will continue to for a decent sports bar in the sunnyslope area. This isn't it."}
{"text":"Always good service and food and good days for football, wings are amazing and so are the breakfasts."}
{"text":"Three of us went into Big Daddy's at around 7:30 PM on Saturday, June 3. I noticed two booths hadn't been bussed yet, which should have tipped me off, but we sat down in the next one. There was no floor server. The bartender saw us, but when I tried to make eye contact she looked away. There were two other tables occupied, one was just finishing, so there was no reason to expect a long wait. But wait we did. The bartender came up to the table behind us and cleared some of it, but without even acknowledging us. Then she went back to the bar while we still waited for someone to at least take our drink order. The bartender took a drink to the back of the lounge and around the corner, then came back with the drink in her hand. All three of us tried to get her attention, but she ignored us and went back behind the bar. She played around with stuff at the bar, served someone sitting there, but still refused to even make eye contact with us. So we got up and walked out. As we were heading for the door, she was about five feet away. I looked at her, and she looked at me for a second with a contemptuous look on her face and then turned away.  A terrible experience. I've don't think I've ever said this before, but they should fire this woman. My friends with me said they were longtime patrons, but after this experience they'd never go back. I certainly won't. It's too bad: they said the food was good and I liked the atmosphere. But I'll never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"Awesome find! We have been looking for a neighborhood bar since we just moved and have found our new spot. The bartender (we can't remember her name) was so friendly and welcoming. We would come back just because of her. But the food was good too. They have a typical bar menu, but they have grilled wings which can be hard to find. They were delicious. We definitely plan on making this a regular spot"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Cheap HH.   However:   1. Only one men's room / too big a place for a one hole. Paper towels out.  2. TV situation at bar is horrible. Especially for a \"sports bar!\"  Just a few, poorly positioned TVs, often obscured by hanging glasses from the bar. One whole side of the bar basically has one TV.  Really could be so much better. Leaving $ on the table as there are few sports bars around there."}
{"text":"Recently made it to Big Daddy's and was super impressed. Everything you'd expect from a great, local eating and drinking establishment. Nothing too fancy, but super clean and very down to earth with great value! Friendly and prompt service from Denise. Numerous beer choices, both basic and craft on tap. I was there for Wednesday half price burger night (they have numerous daily specials) with my daughter and the burgers were done perfectly plus the fries were great. Dave (Big Daddy) visited with us for a while seems like a dedicated owner who knows how to take care of his guests. I saw that they have off track betting there, and folks were really into it.  All in all, I'd definitely recommend and will be back to try the pizzas next."}
{"text":"Had a @groupon, went to have breakfast.  The prices were not bad, but the specials were high enough that the groupon wasn't a great value.  The food was decent enough, and I would likely return."}
{"text":"Went in for living social deal. 16\" 2 topping pizza, 25 wings, and small pitcher of beer.   Thought the pizza was good, wings were over cooked, dry, and tough. Sauces we got were the suicide - which for my taste wasn't to terribly hot!!  The teriyaki - which was bottled sauce, nothing great. And garlic Parmesan, had absolutely no flavor.   Considering the distance from our house we would probably not be going back. Nothing memorable here!!"}
{"text":"Ok, firstoff, Sunday 1/2 price burgers is a deal! This place knows its burgers. I had a 1/2 pound bacon and my accomplice had the 1/4 bbq bacon with an oinion ring. These are hand formed juicy messy and very tasty patties on a really nice fresh bun. Throw in fresh cut fries and at 1/2 price it's 5 or 6 bucks! Had their house IPA to wash it down and it was as perfect of lunch as I've had in a very long time. The waitress/bartender was very nice, personable and entertaining. There was pool, off track betting, a ton of big screen TVs, pinball and who knows what else going on.NO I don't work for them, but I'd think about it if they would pay in burgers and beer."}
{"text":"The French dip sandwich was pretty darn good, surprisingly  satisfied. The pitcher of margaritas, dang. Thumbs up from me. Would not have guessed at first site.  Won't hesitate to come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Big Daddy's for lunch on a Thursday.   The restaurant is out dated and dingy on the inside.  There were only a handful of other patrons in the place when we arrived.  The waitress/bartender was not attentive or friendly to us at all even though she was not busy.  It almost felt as though we were bothering her.  The food took awhile to come out but was not too bad as far as bar food goes.  Would we return to Big Daddy's?   Probably not."}
{"text":"I come here all the time it's a good local bar. It's a Browns bar but they support the Cardinals and show all the games.  They also have good parties here."}
{"text":"Had deep dish pizza and salad. Nothing deep about it. All dough. Canned toppings. Nothing fresh.  Would never order pizza from here"}
{"text":"I checked this place out a couple of times in the same week.  The first day they happened to be having a live NBC sports show going on so that was fun.  They were giving away Christmas ornaments to the patrons of the bar during the commercials and you could talk to the guys doing the show during the commercials too.    The beer selection here is pretty good here too, even have Stout!   I find that many bars will have several different IPA's and not one Stout or Porter, no dark beer at all!  On area this place fails is the food.  Burgers are OK but the wings were a disappointment especially since the best wings intern are a one minute walk from this place.  They refused to grill the wings after putting on the sauce like their neighbor does, saying it would mess up their grill so they deep fry the wings then throw them on the grill to char one side black but there is no flavor from the grilling, just fried wings with no seasoning.    They also must have some games in the bar because there was a couple of guys playing something and one was yelling at the top of his lungs which was very annoying!  I can't believe they didn't tell this guy to lower his voice.  I'm sure I was not the only customer who was annoyed.   I had to drink my beer and get the heck out of there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Beer is cold food is decent! Big Daddy is one of the nicest guys you will meet at the bar. He always says hi to everyone and wants them to have a good time. Bartenders are always friendly. Great little neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for a new breakfast spot and was not disappointed!  The food was great and almost too big! We sit at the bar when we go to eat places and the bartender was lovely.  We were the only ones there but we did get there only a half hour after they opened.  We will definitely be back to try the burgers!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Awesome service! Perfect sports bar."}
{"text":"Small dive bar, friendly staff, food okay but not great although the half price Sat burger day seems like a good deal.   A good hangout  for locals I guess so 3 star for sure but 4 star I am not so sure, but these people who give 5 stars are loons."}
