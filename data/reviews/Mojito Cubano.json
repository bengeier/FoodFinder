{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and the service was very friendly. Its a cozy restaurant with a great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! I really enjoy the Cuban Sandwhich with fried Yucca on side."}
{"text":"Holy Moley! We've been meaning to go and check out Mojito Cubano for months and finally made it over. Grabbed a seat on the very quaint patio and settled in for an amazing meal!  The Yuca Frita was insanely good! The only issue I had was that one of my kids liked them so much she ate most of them. We'll order two next time I guess.   The Roja Veija was pretty much as good as you could imagine - just the right blend of spices and even better when coupled with the house-made medium sauce (I correctly guessed that it would have a nice spiciness to it and skipped the 'hot', which I'm sure is also amazing but probably at my upper limit of comfort).   The Pollo a la Barbacoa was great as well. The chicken was juicy and the sauce, again, was amazing.   The sangria and signature mojito were also must-tries. Very tasty indeed! Closed everything off with the Flan de Coco. Sweet and decadent!  It's not often that a meal nails it on every course for every person but this place pulled it off. Strong reco to give it a try!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a sandwich. We both had the Cuban sandwich. Mine was hot, my companions was medium. The price was $11. It was small and it came with a few fries and it was underwhelming. My companion had apiece of gristle the size of a small tumor in hers. The staff were friendly however I won't go back."}
{"text":"Mojito Cubana opened in my neighbourhood and we recently decided to check it out. Super friendly staff! The bartender chatted with us and we met the chef as well. Food was delish! Everything was really clean and fresh tasting. We ordered the black bean soup which was really tasty and something you'd love to have on a cold night. We also ordered the chicken quesadillas which were very good too. Not too cheesy which can sometimes make the dish really greasy. The garlic shrimp was yummy and soaking the fresh homemade bread in the oil was an added treat. We also ordered the fried plantains which which added a nice little bit of sweetness to our meal. They had just ran out of the chicken wings so we were a little disappointed about that but the chef brought out the sauce he uses so we could give it a try with a little bit of bread. It's a nice and bright tasting sauce with a little bit of a zip! Can't wait to go back and have it on the wings. The only little add, I would suggest to serve a little bit of sour cream or some sort of non-spicy dip to go along with the quesadillas for those that can't handle a tonnes of spice but overall a great new addition to the Parkdale hood!"}
{"text":"Mojito Cubano is located on the north side of Queen St W between Fuller and Macdonnell just west of Jameson Ave.  Parkdale - This is my old stomping grounds since I grew up in Parkdale in my early years around the Jameson and King neighborhood.  This area has a lot of fond memories for me and as such it's always a pleasure to come back for a visit.  The area of Queen Street where Roncesvalles, Queen, King and The Queensway all meet to the intersection of Queen and Dufferin is what I'd define as the Parkdale section of Queen West.  It's changed a lot throughout my life time and while at one time it could have been considered a little rough around the edges I think today it has come a long way and it's starting to see a very noticeable improvement.  A part of that improvement are the little places like this, Mojito Cubano.  If you take all the little shops and stores that have been born and reborn on this strip of Queen it cumulates into what makes this place the great up and coming area it is today.  On a Wednesday I made reservations for 630 for my wife, myself as well as my friend and his wife to meet and have dinner at Mojito.  This place has been in my bookmarks list for probably half a year as a place we've wanted to try for some time.  My wife and I are frequent Miami goers.  We've been going there for decades because I have family there but it's also a very nice place to visit and in all that time we've become spoiled and accustomed to the type of Cuban cuisine standard which is what we've always measured other Cuban restaurants against.  We simply cannot help it because we've had Cuban cuisine in Miami for so long and had so often that we've got to know it so well from places which are as authentic as it gets.  My wife loves Cuban sandwiches and I'd say that she is pretty hard to impress.  From Xoco in Chicago (Rick Bayless) to La Cubana here in Toronto to Julie's which doesn't even offer it, we have really never found a place that makes the Cuban sandwich properly outside of Miami.  We've been to countless places in Florida for Cuban cuisine, here all we are asking for is a place where we can get some of our favorite dishes served up just like or at least as good as what we can get in Miami.  That's not often easy to do for many cuisines but now I can say that Mojito here is truly as authentic as we've had down in Miami.  Why?  Their food is just like what we would get there.  Yes, finally a place that makes what we are used to having all the time we are down there - it's finally here.  To start off because we came a bit earlier than the other couple, I had ordered a mojito (I just had to try it) as well 2 small plates, the fried yuca and fried ripe plantains.  The plantains were good and pretty much exactly what I was expecting but wow the yuca (cassava) were so good.  They were cut in the shape of fries, long as opposed to circular.  The way they were cut mattered because the surface ratio and the fact they were fried made for a much more crispy texture.  It's the difference between a doughnut and a churro which is more crunch when they are long.  They had a bit of garlic to them but they were amazing and an absolute must order every time kind of starter.  The mojito was so good I ended up asking for another.  While we were 2 couples we actually ordered the same dishes as our mains.  Both my friend's wife and I ordered ropas vieja and my friend and wife both ordered the Cubano sandwiches which came with papas fritas (fries).   The ropas was served with plantain, rice with beans and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.  The sandwich, now we're talking.  I hate to mention other restaurants but seriously the one and only time I've been to La Cubana on Roncesvalles was sad.  That so called Cuban sandwich they served was on freaking sliced bread!  That's just not right.  That's like trying to substitute penne for linguine as they're simply not the same thing, not even close.  The hallmark of Mojito is yes, they do in fact make their own torta (Cuban bread) and they pressed it beautifully.  To me that is the defining factor if you can even call a Cuban sandwich a Cuban sandwich.   If they are done properly they are made with torta, just like how Philly cheesesteaks are made with fried steak, not roast beef.  Torta is like the motto for Porsche, there is no substitute.  Now the sandwich itself is amazing and the real deal Holyfield, period.  This is what would make me come back if it was the only thing I had to choose, a properly done right Cuban sandwich, no question.  Besides the authentic and amazing Cuban cuisine, Christina our server was kind, friendly and helpful and yes she does speak Spanish.  My friend ordered his food in Spanish and he happens to be from Miami so yes, we're all Cuban cuisine snobs.  Mojito met my expectations as far as having authentic Cuban cuisine instead of being disappointed in every other place we've gone to outside of Florida when it comes to Cuban cuisine."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner at Mojito Cubano and wow, that was delicious! Had a few Mojito's ($10) which were the best I've had in the city to start then split some food with my wife. We ordered the flank steak ($17) and the Cuban sandwich ($11) and shared both. The homemade hot sauce really took the Cuban sandwich to a new level. It was delicious and not greasy like the Cuban sandwich at La Cubana. The atmosphere was really nice with the Spanish music. I felt like I was actually in Cuba as the restaurant was nice and warm on a cold night (I hate how so many of these new places neglect keeping the place warm). The flank steak was delicious also. The plantains were a nice compliment and the Cuban rice was very tasty also. Definitely looking forward to returning for some mojitos and to try some other items on the menu. Their wine is crazy cheap also at $28 per bottle. Makes a very great affordable date night or dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"We scheduled the dinner and booked with enough time. We were a big group. After waiting 2 1/2 hours for dinner, the consent of the majority was that food was not great.  Yucca frita was really good. However the congris was not good. Fish was lacking flavour, roast chicken was not good either. Ropa vieja was good, I ordered and I liked it. In general, an advice is to either reject or well coordinate food preparation when a big group is accepted. The kitchen is small and there was only one cooker there. He did a good effort but we spend more than 3 hours on the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Parkdale addition. Good, fresh food at a great price point. Spanish omelette was perfect, and the cubano was like a tightly-wound condensation of flavour. Eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! From the service, to the ambiance, and of course- the food! We entered into a surprisingly empty restaurant. The place was small and cozy, with dim lighting and authentic Cuban decor and Spanish music. We were welcomed by the friendly owner, who happened to also be the chef, while his wife (I assume) was responsible for serving the food.  So apparently the chef makes all the food fresh there and then, which is why I was glad that the restaurant was empty since I was starving and knew the food would take some time to make. Since my last experience at La Cubana, I was afraid of the portion size being too small.  My brother got the vegetarian insalata and a side of fried cassava. My dad, who hasn't had a Cuban sandwich since our trip to Miami was extremely anxious for one, so he was ecstatic to get that. My mom got the Spanish omelette and I went for the Chicken in Cuban style bbq sauce, however I asked if I could swap the potatoes for the Cuban rice. The owner/chef was happy to do that for me. The food took around 20 to 25mins to arrive, but wow, they were all fantastic! The food was presented beautifully and the portion sizes were perfect! My chicken was to die for, honestly! It was tender and juicy and had some sautéed mushrooms and an unbelievable marinade.  Additionally, my brother was in awe with the fried cassava and my dad mentioned that the Cuban sandwich was comparable to the one from Miami. Finally we ended it with an authentic Cuban style coffee, which was the strongest coffee I have ever had!  Next time I would love to try the sandwich and a side of the bean soup...and the Cuban rice again.  This place is so good and definitely deserves to gain more hype!"}
