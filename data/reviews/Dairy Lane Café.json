{"text":"Had the salmon avocado eggs Benedict. It was a large portion, too much really. Presentation was appealing. Well cooked and tasty. The golden brown home fries were nicely salted and just the right amount of crunchy.   The Fratello coffee was a good diner coffee.   It's a better than average breakfast."}
{"text":"I would love them soooo mch more if they took reservations!  Seriously guys - open up some extra space (buy upstairs) and reach your potential!  So may people waiting soooo long :(  Minus the wait - great place!"}
{"text":"The breakfast fare is hearty and delicious, though not unique or stellar enough for five stars.  What is stellar is the house coffee.  A special Dairy Lane blend by Fratello, this is hands down the best medium/light roast coffee bean I have ever had.  I go out of my way to refill my supply be will be taking as much as customs will allow back with me to the States.   If you like dark, rich (bitter) coffee, this may not be the blend for you, but pour through drip or French press on this bean is outstanding.  I can't believe they got the chocolate and hazelnut tones on this roast without adding flavors."}
{"text":"We've been going here for 15 years and it never disappoints.  Breakfast Sammy and Eggs Benedict are our staples.   Go on a Saturday so you can browse for clothes at Tapestry while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"was pleasantly surprised by the many vegetarian options available at dairy lane!  i ended up getting the carribbean jerk vegan scramble and it was incredible.  the restaurant is tiny, so it fills up fast & you might end up waiting for a table, but the food is worth it!  service was friendly and the coffee is quite nice."}
{"text":"Coffee was excellent.  The food was great although mine came out a little cold.  It was super cute and very small.  We didn't have to wait but that was definitely perfect timing and a lot of luck.  By the time we left, there was a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the stuffed French toast. The bread was dry (couldn't tell if it had even been dipped in egg), the promised bacon sure looked like ham (if it was back bacon, it should have been advertised as such) and the pile of potatoes was dry and lukewarm. Certainly not worth $12.75."}
{"text":"You'd have to be insane not to dig on the tasty food being dished up at the Dairy Lane.  This little upscale diner in West Hillhurst may be limited in size (in real estate parlance, I believe it would be identified as \"charming\" or \"cozy\"), but what the place lacks in size it makes up for by delivering big portions and even bigger flavour.   That equation also brings big crowds, to be prepared to wait for a table.  Normally waiting is a drag, but it's actually kind of enjoyable at the Dairy Lane.  They have a small patio with seating and drink service available for the hungry masses anxiously awaiting their tables.  Your patience is sure to be rewarded when you get your grub.   I got a cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake.  The  1/2 lb burger is thick and juicy, and the toppings were nice and fresh.  A damned good burger, although I didn't really notice any cheese on it.  You'd figure eating a cheeseburger at an establishment that highlights dairy products in their name would result in a thicker slab of cheese.  However, the big chocolate shake was a real stand-out - thick and velvety, and the best shake I've had in Calgary bar none.  The home cut fries were a little on the cool side, but I'm sure they'd be great fresh.  They looked good, but didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've been to in Calgary.  Creatively done, locally sourced, tasty and filling breakfast and lunch options.  Get here early to get a seat though! I've waited up to 45 minutes for this place (and YES it was worth it). Sometimes they offer free coffee to those who are waiting too.  Try... anything! I have been three times and haven't had a bad meal yet! Their strawberry lemonade sangria is particularly refreshing and well blended though."}
{"text":"The food here was incredible. And bonus - local fare! The serving staff were friendly and the atmosphere was really relaxed. It was a busy little place even on a Monday morning (always a good sign!) if you haven't tried it yet -  it's a must!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been regulars here for many years and have always enjoyed the food and friendly service. Tonight, however, a mix up in entering our order caused it to get lost. After a very long wait, a staff member came over to our table and explained the unfortunate mishap. Our order was served to our satisfaction soon after.  I just wanted to point out that the staff was very professional in handling the matter. We've always thought of it as a classy place but tonight they knocked it out of the park! They showed that they truly care about their customers and for this we will keep coming back!  Thanks, DL!"}
{"text":"This was my second stop at this busy little cafe.  My friend and I enjoyed the daily omlette special and the breakfast burrito.    Our food arrived hot, fast and delicious.  The menu could use more gluten free options.  Service was great right up to the moment we ordered, it's easy to forgive not seeing our waitress again, when I reflect on how busy this little cafe was, and how tasty outed food was.  We arrived at 10 am on a Monday, and did not have to wait  for a table."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp on our last day in Calgary.  We arrived around 10:30 and the wait was only about 20 minutes... which I thought was great for a Saturday morning.  I ordered the smoked salmon & avocado benedict.  My boyfriend ordered the cheese burger.  My benedict was excellent and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal too.  The only gripe I had was that our food took awhile, when compared to the tables who ordered before/after us."}
{"text":"Dairy lane burger with yam fries - DELISH! A classic burger dinner you can truly enjoy. I usually get mine with sautéed mushroom added to it. I think it gives you that extra flavor that you'd fall in love with.   Prices are little bit more on the pricey side so I would eat at this place, here and there - whenever I crave it. Decent services, their drinks are also amazing. Not too sure about coffee. I've come here about 10 times so far over the past year or two and they have yet to disappoint me!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny, a hole in the wall in a residential neighbourhood strip mall. The service was lovely - we even got a cup of hot coffee to enjoy while we waited outside on the patio. Good, wholesome food with a fresh-feeling menu and a decent selection of gluten-free and veggie options. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is cute, small, popular and always has consistently great food. Im always a fan of a store that uses local product. I just wish I lived closer by!"}
{"text":"It's a local gem. The food and service are both phenomenal.  The place gets busy, this said whilst you are waiting they serve free coffee?  Who else does that?  This place rocks."}
{"text":"This place doesn't really need another review saying how great it is, but we stopped in there tonight and the burgers were great. Reasonable wait, okay prices for the quality we got (~$35 for two), and nice interior. The place is tiny, about 20 people capacity or something like that, but at night it isn't super busy. I've passed by on Sunday morning, if you get cranky when you are hungry then don't bother, you'll be waiting forever."}
{"text":"What's not to love? A perfect balance between delicious local foods, genuine down to earth staff and a cute cozy place to sit down and relax. I love their omelettes, jams, coffee and lemonade. Super yum! Try it! I promise you will love it :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly great food. I love breakfast and this place does it well. All the ingredients are local and you can taste the difference. Only issue you need to know is the place is very small and widow will wait for a table."}
{"text":"would recommend this be your first option for breakfast in Calgary.  flew up to calgary on business. was in need of clean, filling, hearty breakfast food. i'm a snob. i like things to look, feel and actually present to the table in a clean, stimulating, unique appeal.  dairy lane cafe met all requirements.  i had stuffed french toast and added one scrambled egg with avocado. had a glass of oj and water with the meal and took a brewed organic coffee with soy to go.   most restaurants' orders of french toast will produce 6 or 8 half-slices of toast and tons of butter and syrup to mask for bland taste.   dairy lane's french toast was simple. two pieces of thick crusted bread, battered and grilled perfectly. the filling was tart and tasted like real berries, not like a prepacked sugar serum."}
{"text":"I love this place for any meal of the day! Breakfast is amazing! I am a big fan of the stuff French toast! I am also a regular for Taco Tuesday and would have to say that every taco has been amazing to date! I love the quaint and cozy atmosphere and the super friendly staff"}
{"text":"We've been to dairy lane for brunch & lunch. We have had several different dishes and they've all been fresh & tasty! The staff is very friendly & attentive to you. Place is smaller but love the ambiance and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and her 2 yrs old, great food and wonderful service!! Not a very big place but very sweet and cozy. Definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, cute location and it's walking distance from my house so my boyfriend and I frequent it weekly. All the servers are so friendly and inviting, and the restaurant is small so it feels like you're being welcomed into a friends house. Also, their coffee blend is one of the best in the city in my opinion... I always have 3 cups while I'm there and I usually only make it through half a cup anywhere else (It's a fratello so it makes sense). Always get a stuffed savory french toast, the portion is huge, and I always finish it because it's that good. Cute patio too :)"}
{"text":"really loved their food and the place, but didn't have chance to try their breakfast. plus it's in very quite neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Delicious stuffed French toast! Cute diner. Small and cozy. Friendly staff. Tried a bite of my friend's grilled cheese. It was equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Vegan burger, love their yam and potato fries. The Black bean and corn chowder is yummy. Tofu scramble for breakie is nice. Only thing is if I go there often, it gets boring. Would be nice to see some new Vegan options or daily specials. Will keep coming back for the burgers. Love the support for organic and locally sourced products."}
{"text":"It's great to have this little gem in my neighborhood. There's always a wait for weekend breakfast/lunch so I tend to go for early dinners. The food is tasty and prepared with care but it can take a while if they're busy. The fried chicken and milkshakes have been especially delicious. Mysteriously, the soup is chronically underseasoned. Service is good and it seems like a well-run establishment. I'll be a regular for years to come."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is a tiny, fifty-year-old cafe and restaurant located just outside Kensington on cozy 19th Street NW.  We arrived at eleven thirty on a chilly October Sunday, to find ourselves facing a very reasonable ten-minute wait. As you wait you are welcome to sit down and chat over a coffee at one of their outdoor patio tables that are complete with snuggly blankets.  Upon being seated indoors (in a tiny room with seating for only twenty or so customers) we scoped out a menu of inspired breakfast and brunch fare, including a yummy-looking French toast dish and a vegan jerk tofu scramble.  I opted for a veggie omelette topped with their bruschetta mix and served with a side of hashbrowns, rye bread and locally-made jam.  In fact, the entire menu had a local focus, from the produce to the cheese to the sausages!  My omelette was great- it was big, stuffed full of veggies and the bruschetta mix on top was the perfect compliment.  My friend enjoyed her \"All In\" omelette as well.  Service was quick and friendly (and cute too!).  There is plentiful street parking for those arriving by car.  All in all, Dairy Lane is the type of restaurant I hate to review... because I wish I could keep it my little secret!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I love to seek out when I'm in Vancouver. A small diner full of character! Their menu is great...I had the Carribean Pork burger and enjoyed every bite! What I also liked is that many (if not all, I'm not sure) of the ingredients on the menu items are from nearby farms and are organic! This is exactly the type of place to go when you want to show around an out-of-towner just how good it can get in this city!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast there this morning. Although the place itself is pretty small, their turnover is very quick and the staff is great. Our server was quick and helpful and the eggs benedict, even though a bit on the pricier side, are AWESOME.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Would meet my friends here pre & post-baby. Difficult to bring in a stroller on the patio due to space. Stroller parking could be accommodated, maybe staff could show you a spot off the patio that is not too far away. Food is good. Staff could be nicer - telling a new mom that the stroller can't go on the patio is unhelpful. Offering a solution of where the stroller may be parked is helpful (Note: I avoid peak days & times)."}
{"text":"If you have not eaten here yet, you are missing out!  I would have to say that this is my favourite breakfast place in Calgary right now - and I am a breakfast LOVER!  I can't comment on too many dishes as I usually always get the same meal here - the eggs benedict.  I know that's bad and I need to venture out a little more, but the eggs bennie is SO good, it's the only thing I usually want (and they have 3 types)!  I have also enjoyed the triple breakfast when I am super hungry, as it is very filling.    Even though the prices are a little higher than some other breakfast places, I don't mind this because they get their produce/meat/cheese locally.  Always feels good to support local businesses and farmers.  Plus, the customer service is phenomenal every time!  You may have to wait a little longer to get seated, but they are always very helpful and you can sip on tea/coffee while you wait.  I cannot say enough about the great service I have received here every visit!  During my last visit on Tuesday, I found out they are offering gluten free bread now which makes me very happy.  A step in the right direction for those of us out there with dietary restrictions.    So I say, go there for the eggs bennie... or you know, another meal... as soon as you can! ;)"}
{"text":"Worst service I've received in months. Made the mistake of sitting down before the waitress cleaned the table. Waitress let us know she was vexed. We then waited 1.5 hrs for our order, watchig several patrons come and go. I called the waitress on this and was told our order had accidentally been forgotten and that this was a coincidence. After 2 hours,  they reduced our bill by 50% and removed drink costs, which is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"The tofu scramble was very tasty. A fairly small portion though (a larger option would be nice). Coffee was good. The wait was quite long."}
{"text":"I'll make this one quick and easy.  Ambiance is ok. Too small and tight. If there are more than 4 or 5 tables full, get ready to listen in all your neighbor's conversations.  Décor is nice. Lots of old pictures of Calgary and some interesting art. Music is eclectic but it can become a little too loud, especially if your under the speaker. The fresh flowers on the tables is nice.  As far as the food, we have only had the Dairy Lane Burgers so far and they are amazing. You can taste the difference that quality grass fed beef has. Juicy. Tender. D-Lish! They actually use organic red (not white) tomatoes which is great.  The fries however, not so great. They use Kennebec potatoes. These are supposed to be the best possible potatoes for french fries. If they are, then they don't fry them right. They are too soggy. We asked for crispier ones the next time and they were still the same, soggy.  I decided the following time not to order the fries with my burger but I was still charged for something I didn't like or want.  All in all, a good place to try if it's not too crowded."}
{"text":"The service here is always good, right attitude, respectful and patient. Good food too"}
{"text":"Eggs benny was ok but not the best I've ever had, as I was promised.  We waited for an hour to get in and then another hour for our food but everyone seemed happy once it came. This might be one of those places that was hyped so much that it ended up letting me down a bit.  I will go back and give it another try though if I'm in the neighborhood and the lineup doesn't look too long"}
{"text":"A family favourite for breakfast. The food  and service has always been excellent. It's a cozy place, and you may have to wait for a table, but it's so worth it!  I categorized Dairy Lane as good for kids, but I wanted to add that we have only dined there in the morning with our toddler, and I'm not sure what the ambiance is like in the evenings. It may not be good for kids, since the tables are quite close together."}
{"text":"I'd go here again but it wouldn't be my first choice. I thought it was quite expensive, and maybe I had just heard too many good things, but I was expecting more. I had the salmon and avocado eggs benny anda coffee. The service was very, very slow. It was a weekday morning and not crazy busy, but as far as I could tell the servers seemed to be chatting to each other rather then checking on tables or taking orders. I don't need to be asked if I'm enjoying my meal every 5 or 10 minutes, but a coffee refill would be great.   I'd probably suggest somewhere else next time, but I wouldn't be upset to eat here again."}
{"text":"Best chicken burgers here! Can be a little pricy but the food and service is always good."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Dairy Lane for a while now, and so when two friends came in from Saskatoon we couldn't pass up the opportunity for lunch. Let me say it was a wonderful experience!   First off, the Dairy Lane logo is nice: clean, compact, and engaging. The menu is organized well, and the local supplier list at the bottom gave me a feeling of sustainability. Nice. Hip. Cool.  Emeka, Becky, Sam (the Greater), and I ordered the following: Two Dairy Lane Burgers ('meka and Becky), Spicy Chorizo Burger (Sam the Greater), Turkey Burger (me), and some Grizzly Paw sodas. The Turkey Burger and Dairy Lane burgers with yam fries were excellent! The only slight \"blip\" in our meal was that the Spicy Chorizo burger was not that spicy. Also, it didn't seem that there was any special dip for the yam fries...but I'm just being picky now. I need to be so picky with minuscule details because the meal was just THAT good!  So worth the wait to get in. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant. In town on a business trip and found it on Yelp.   Had the smoked meat hash from the features menu. It was ok. The ingredients were fresh which was awesome but I thought the dish could have been a little more epic considering the reviews for the restaurant. The GF bun as a substitute for toast was terrible. Huge and doughy. GF bread would have been better. But their homemade jam was fantastic and the coffee was awesome.   Service was also good. Obviously a popular place as there was a short wait. Service is quick."}
{"text":"My wife and I are here three or four times a month at least because DL is our favorite breakfast place in Calgary.  We've tried everything on the menu, but the Hillhurst Sammy and the stuffed french toast are our favorites.  For lunch/dinner, I like the pork burger with the sesame mandarin salad as a side.  All of the food is excellent, just beware that this is a popular place so there is often a line-up to get in on weekends (there are only ten two-seater-tables in the restaurant, about four two seater tables outside - weather permitting).  Dairy Lane is now open evenings seven days a week so evenings might be easier to get in.  The burgers are always excellent and there are daily specials which are also delicious.  If you are near Bridgeland, you can try the sister restaurant \"Blue Star Diner\"."}
{"text":"What a great little place for breakfast. Wow! My boyfriend and I went to this quaint place because of it's great reviews and we were not disappointed.  I had the Yogurt and Granola and the boyfriend has the Eggs Benny with red pepper and avocado. Both were amazingly delicious. The fruit and yogurt was perfect. It was plain yogurt seasoned with home made granola piled with a variety of fruits including pineapples, oranges and grapes. I've never seen so much colour on a breakfast plate.  The Eggs and Benny has a side of hashbrowns, but we suggest you skip the hashbrowns and replace it with a side of fruit you might believe you're eating a healthy breakfast. There wasn't too much hollandaise on the Eggs Benedict. It was the perfect amount ((considering how fattening the hollandaise is in the first place)).   We'll be back to check out the dinner and definitely back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here, and I've had almost everything on the menu!  Everything is fresh, and local which really makes a difference in taste. On the weekends it's a good idea to get there before you're hungry because you will most likely have to wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This cafe is amazing! The service is friendly and efficient. It's very popular so you'll either have to wait or call ahead before you go. I had the chicken club and it was delicious; I loved the baguette it came on because it soft and fresh. The avocado also made the sandwhich. I'd highly recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I only got to take part in YYC Burger week for one meal this year, fortunately it was at Dairy Lane!  We met up with our burger loving friends for dinner, they didn't book reservations which made me go into a slight panic as I've heard that it gets busy here. I think we timed it perfectly because a table cleared out just as we arrived. Food whizzed past us as we glanced over the menu - the YYC burger they had (2 angus and brisket patties, cheddar, cured bacon, tomato marmalade, roasted garlic and shallot mustard, butterleaf lettuce, DL mayo and pickled onions) was definitely a big seller because everyone seemed to be ordering it and it was HUGE!  The staff was great - super friendly and made the effort to chat with us even though it was busy. I guess since it's a smaller venue, it allows for them to get to know their customers better.  The guys both got the YYC burger, I settled with the Dairy Lane burger and my girlfriend ordered the pork tacos. The food came out relatively quickly and it all looked really good.  My burger was really juicy and flavorful, and I had a few bites of the YYC burger - it was pretty amazing! I didn't get to try the pork tacos, but I was told they were tasty.  Dairy Lane uses food from local farmers and suppliers which is a plus, and I really liked my experience here so I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Nice. We stumbled across this place when our actual destination was blocked due to a festival one Sunday morning. I remembered hearing great things so we gave it a try.  Despite it being 9 or so on a Sunday morning there wasn't a wait. We were seated inside. We were impressed by how clean and well kept everything was. It was a bit noisy but we could still chat without too much trouble.  I had the back bacon and tomato eggs benny and the man had whatever the big breakfast is. Our food came fast and everything looked great. My date was missing a chicken sausage which they were quick to explain and promised it would be out shortly. It was! The food was tasty with decent portions. I like that they use local suppliers and have little cards on the table featuring info about some of them.  While it isn't the cheapest breakfast in town, I think the prices are fair as the food is done really well. Our server was easily confused which made things a bit awkward but she was polite and attentive.  This is a great little spot indeed!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite spot for brunch in Calgary,  with the only negative being that there is always /at least/ a 15 minute lineup. The food and service are both awesome- I have never had a bad dish there. %100 recommended."}
{"text":"I just moved to Calgary and wanted to checkout a breakfast place. I went at 11 am on Sunday morning and had about a 45 minute wait. I was greeted by a friendly waitress who presented me with a great cup of coffee. This place is tiny! 8 tables. One thing I did notice was the extremely young crowd. I am in my mid 30s and was probably the oldest person there. The wait outside probably deters more mature patrons.  I ordered French toast with hash browns. It was delicious. When I got my final bill, I was surprised that that cup of coffee was $3...that's not much but I am cheap. All in all this should be a dining experience for those who are in Calgary.  That $3 coffee has still left a bitter taste in my mouth...should have used more sugar...."}
{"text":"A great local restaurant. Very good quality of food."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian and gluten free burger ever. Hands down. And the fries? Ermagerd. They taste like fresh (not frozen!) Potatoes.   I'm a Vancouver food snob and I have to say, nothing in my beloved Vancity has come close. Just freaking check it out."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I had the best burger I've ever eaten here. True story. I came here for dinner when I was feeling a bit tired/hungover and it was the perfect cure. The waitress was super friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in, and I was able to get one of my favourite dark beers and my first ever root beer float straight away (although she seemed a little amused that both of those items were for me). The root beer float had heaps of ice cream and they give you the rest of the glass bottle to keep topping up the root beer (making it foam even more!). I got the Dairy Lane Burger, and added a bunch of extras like mushroom (because it's not really a burger without mushroom), bacon (ditto, which came extra crispy just as requested - as bacon should be), peppered gouda (because by now I was just on a roll) and happily changed the sauce for me to sweet pepper mayo when I spied it lurking on another burger. Even better, you can get a side of soup with the burger, and the soup of the day was potato and bacon. Even more bacon! I'm pretty sure this 'soup' is really just a grownup way of eating mashed potato with bacon, but I love it.  This place takes part in Mealshare, and have a separate menu where if you buy something off that menu, they donate a meal to Mealshare. I loved this idea but just couldn't pass up the burger on the regular menu. They also list all of their local suppliers on a board behind the counter area which my friend thought was a bit pretentious but I really liked - I'd always pick local produce and businesses."}
{"text":"Diary Lane is the perfect place for breakfast. Have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered here! Prepare for a long wait if your going on the weekends, this place is busy! When the food is this good though, it's so worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Lane.  The food is consistently great and the service is always good.  It is a wonderful local gem that serves organic and local food.  I am particularly fond of the breakfast tostada and burrito, but everything that I have had so far has been good.  It can be a bit crowded on weekends but it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Calgary has a great breakfast culture. Give us big eggs on our homemade toast, thick bacon with our fluffy pancakes and bottomless fresh coffee. Maybe it's the rancher in all of us that likes a good hearty breakfast on the weekend, maybe we just like good food, but whatever the case, Calgary likes its breakfast and it likes it good.   This produces a city full of demanding breakfast patrons; and when seasoned breakfast eaters meet locally sourced ingredients, the result is Diary Lane.  Dairy Lane's fresh, local, ingredients, fast service, hard-not-to-guzzle juices, cream-cheese stuffed french toast and eggs benedict creates a city-meets-country farm-fresh breakfast joint that can keep even the most seasoned breakfast eater satisfied.   Unfortunately, even though Diary Lane has the word 'diary' in the title, there are not many unique, diary-inspired menu items and because of it's popularity, Diary Lane often is very busy, so expect long waits on weekends.  But if you are willing to wait and don't care that there isn't a lot of cheese to choose from, a breakfast at Diary Lane can satisfy that farmer in all of us, adding another great breakfast option to Calgary.  T."}
{"text":"It's small and quite bustling on weekends. I like busy places when I'm brunching, I think that's kind of how brunch should be. All the chaos and clanking cutlery, the hung over folks mixed with the rise n shiners. This is that kind of place, with a mix of people all making the pilgrimage for the same reason: brunch.  I have been to Dairy Lane a few times, mostly for brunch. I have also tried their burgers on an evening stop over - which are excellent.  As everyone says, be prepared to wait a bit. It's a small resto and the owners know this and do their best to make it a comfy wait. While you are waiting, the staff will hook you up with a hot drink and there is a bit of space to wait in the back of the resto. If you are outside, there are blankets to keep you warm - such a thoughtful touch, I love it!  The food here is always bang on. I have never had a bad meal and this place never fails to please the company I bring.  The menu is littered with local ingredients (Spraggs, Silverstar) and Dairy Lanes offerings just sound so darn good. I pretty much always order the traditional breakfast: 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. I love it every time and always have a big smile after that breakfast. I always say I will try the breakfast sandwich, stuffed french toast or even a special - but it's always one of those \" I'll try that next time\" because I can't resist the traditional and I know I'll be back. I am seriously considering rocking it out hobbit style, with second breakfast just so I can try more of the menu.   Yummy eats, spot on service and lovely atmosphere - I say add this place to your list of brunch places to hit up."}
{"text":"Meh this place was just OK. Not worth the wait considering going how many amazing breakfast places there are in the city. It's sister resto bluestar cafe is way better."}
{"text":"This tasted absolutely amazing. I flew in from Texas Thursday night and this has by far been the most lovely heart felt food I've tasted here. I am so happy I came."}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh (I had a burger) but the entire experience seemed underwhelming and overrated .. maybe it was because I went for a late lunch but I don't think I would go back or recommend to a friend. Yes the food was good but I left thinking, \"what's the big deal?\""}
{"text":"It's been a year and a half and after so many failed attempts to grab brunch here we finally decided on dinner after reading it had one of the top 10 burgers in town.    Even at 7:55pm (last seating at 8pm) we got the last table in the place.  Whew.    I got the regular burger with side salad and husband got the bison burger special with fries.  The meals were simple but really tasty.  You can tell at first bite they are using quality meat which makes such a difference.    This was a tasty meal but the room is really small and you could hear everyone's conversation.  This bothers me less at breakfast/ brunch - not sure why...at dinner it is slightly annoying.  Patio for me next time where the light traffic and neighborhood noises will drown out the next table!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to enjoy a patio breakfast. The food was decent. Ordered the salmon eggs Benedict. Eggs were farm fresh and nicely orange in colour. I would come here more for the patio experience on a nice morning."}
{"text":"Tried it today and will now be a regular.  Upon entering I was made to feel at home and I was very comfortable.  The staff were professional and the service was first rate.  I ordered a pork and chorizo burger with a side of black bean and corn soup.  The flavours were vibrant and tasty without being overwhelming.    As information, the inside of the restaurant seats 25 or so people, and another 20 or so on the sidewalk patio.  That said, the tables seem to turn over fairly quickly and those waiting were given coffee by the staff.  Nice touch.    They serve wine and beer, and seemed to have a nice selection of desserts.    I can't wait to go back.  Give it a try.  ....and back I went for a late afternoon lunch.    Note: Kitchen closes at 4 PM for 30 minutes.    I had the Dairy Lane burger with bacon and fries.  It was terrific.    I noticed the list of Alberta suppliers on the wall.   The local sourcing of food combined with the care and attention it gets in prep make for great results."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane makes amazing food that is not going to hurt your pocket book. Their vegetarian options are so good that even a meat-lover such as myself will go there for a nice and filling black bean burger (not sure if that is still on the menu though). Together with its sister diner at Blue Star, these are must go restaurants of Calgary. It is great for a gathering of friends, though may not be as nice for a date (Blue Star is a much better setting for that)."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers at a not insane price, adding cheese or bacon however is over priced.  The burgers bun really needs to be toasted a bit or they become extremely soggy, mainly because if the excessive house sauce added.      The burger itself was tasty if too lightly seasoned.  The side pickle was tasty but I found the tomato to be bland, it certainly wasn't fresh.  The fries were tasty and when asked were delivered with mayo- at an insane (and undisclosed) price.  Not worth a trip but acceptable if close."}
{"text":"Being a New Englander who loves a good breakfast/brunch I was jonesing for some comfort food - I had read that Dairy Lane is one of the best breafasts in Calgary.  So I had to check it out.  I rented a car one weekend and a friend and I headed there for breaky.  It's very small - it might seat about 20 at most.  There were a few people waiting already - you have to walk into the back of the restaurant to wait in a small hallway.  But its nice that they'll give you your coffee and have fixings for it in the hallway.  My egg scramble was good - nice organic ingredients.  But it was nothing special.  If this is the best that Calgary has to offer for breakfast I'm bumming."}
{"text":"If I was to start a restaurant, in my dreams it looks an awful lot like Dairy Lane. There's a lot to be said for an adorable little spot doing great locally sourced food in a small kitchen and a dining room that seats 20. The service was excellent and it was by far my favorite spot I visited in Calgary.   I am typically able to make a choice on a menu quickly, but everything sounded so good it took me not one but two \"I need an extra minute\" stops from my waitress. I settled on the Dairy Lane Veggie Burger, and it was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. The multigrain bun was soft but not flimsy, keeping the contents in place to the last bite. The green chilies added a nice hint of spice, and the aged cheddar helped keep the delicious patty together while adding an unctuous cheese hit. Perfectly balanced and very delicious.  The burger was served alongside a healthy pile of perfectly fried and salted fries, and washing it all down with a crisp local blonde ale made for a lovely meal indeed. When I'm travelling I don't like to repeat stops, but I could eat here multiple meals a day and be perfectly happy. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I ate at Dairy Lane yesterday and the Yelp reviews were right. Everything about this place was excellent! I had the chicken club which comes with a load of fries and my friend had the veggie burger and salad which looked big enough to feed 3 people. There was also a cute cat that was hanging out on the patio and all the guests were fighting for her attention."}
{"text":"Pretty good small place , hipsters rave about it . But it's just average . Only like 8 tables inside so always seems busy . Not much around this area so it gets a lot of business that way I think ."}
{"text":"Aesthetically pleasing, small cafe in Kensington. Visited on a Saturday, around 1pm, and it was pretty busy. Service was very friendly, however very slow. I got a Savoury French Toast, my friend got a Breakfast Burrito, and it took around 40 minutes for the food to arrive.   The portion sizes are very big, somewhat justifying the expensive price for one meal. I believe the burrito and french toast were $17 each. I also felt as if the food lacked flavour. There was some salt & pepper here and there, but overall the meal was very one-dimensional. We had to add lots of hot sauce for it to taste decent. Despite this, the potatoes that come with each meal are AMAZING. (Tip: this may sound odd but the potatoes with syrup is a winning combination !!!)  Overall, nice place for breakfast/brunch, but the only reason I'd return is for the potatoes."}
{"text":"Delicious! I went here for a brunch date with my boyfriend, we definitely chose the right place to try!  What a cute little cafe. We went on a Sunday morning, and though seating inside had a 20 minute wait time, there was plenty of seating outside. Good thing it was a warm Chinook day.   My boyfriend got the Triple Double and I got the Eggs Benedict with back bacon and grilled tomato. I'm a sucker for eggs benedict and Dairy Lane didn't disappoint! Portion sizes were great and the hash was so good. We were both really happy with our meals.  We were so hungry and the food looked so good I totally forgot to take pictures!   The cafe had a great atmosphere, service was great, and parking was easy to find. Over all it was a great experience. I'll be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food!  What a gem you would drive by if you didn't look closely for it.."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is a great spot for breakfast and brunch. Actually, they do a really nice lunch as well! But I am going to focus on the breakfast part of their business.  My absolute favorite thing here is the Hillhurst Breakfast Sammy. It's two  fried eggs with aged cheddar on sourdough toast with tomato, butter leaf lettuce and red pepper mayo. Hash browns on the side. It sounds so simple. And it is. But that's why it's so good! It's just so tasty. It doesn't lie, set false pretenses, set high expectations and then disappoint... it's just straightforward and so delicious. If you like savory breakfast that doesn't involve eggs as the focus, this is for you.   Their orange juice is fresh and amazing, and their breakfast cocktails are good too! My sister often gets whatever they have as their breakfast special, which can be found written on the chalkboard on the wall. Normally, their specials have a special little something, like rosemary whipped cream. Sounds odd, tastes amazing.   The only drawback is that the place is so small that you inevitably have to wait for a table. But if it's nice out, you can loiter by the railing outside and pour yourself a cup of coffee while you wait. Cream and sugar provided."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, nice featured items. Only problem? They need more tables :-)."}
{"text":"I've been to Dairy Lane Cafe twice.. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. Breakfast was good, dinner was great!!  When I went for breakfast, it was packed - so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, I tried this dish with eggs and nachos and it was excellent! Very tasty. Service was alright, a bit on the slow side, but its a small restaurant with limited staff, so you have to know this when visiting this place.  A few weeks later I had a craving for a burger so we popped in there to check out their burgers. I had the first burger on the menu, which is their standard beef burger and my dining partner had a bison burger (special of the day). I remember mine absolutely delectable. I might have taken a bite of the bison burger too, but cannot remember much of that because my tastebuds were swimming in the pleasures of my beef burger. It was seriously good. I had a glass of wine to go with it too, but I found that to be a bit expensive.  Overall, I would most definitely go back here for burgers! Be prepared to wait though."}
{"text":"The menu is fantastic and the ingredients are high-quality. Definitely one of the better breakfast menu's in town. However, I get so claustrophobic when I come here to eat and the quality of the coffee always give me caffeine anxiety or jitters.. so I have a hard time enjoying my meal with the lack of space."}

{"text":"Dairy Lane, I'm a fan of your sister restaurant, Blue Star, so I knew I was going to get something delicious here. After avoiding your curry Tofu scramble at B* and opting instead for the Vegan Burger, I finally decided to try it. I avoided it, because I'm often hesitant when restaurants try to jazz up bland ingredients with exotic spices that nothing else on their menu has. Think, veggie \"oriental\" spring rolls on a menu that has no other Asian \"inspired\" options. It makes me jump to two conclusions:  1) This is coming out of a giant freezer bag and is either being reheated in the microwave or tossed in to a deep fryer or both.  2) The chef has never made anything vegan before, and did what my Dad used to do when he was tearing his hair out trying to make ~*something*~ for his angsty vegan teenage daughter: Unloaded the entire contents of the spice cabinet on to an unsuspecting block of tofu, and mashed it GOOD AND DEAD.  Now, since I had enjoyed their black bean Vegan Burger on several occasions already at B*, I was hopeful that this would not be the case and went ahead and ordered the Curry Tofu scramble. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and came with half an avocado, two grilled slices of beefsteak tomatoes, a dipping cup filled with blackberries and strawberries, and rye toast.   The Tofu scramble wasn't what I'm typically used to when I make it at home; it was chopped rather than crumbled and was smothered in onions, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. I won't knock off a star because of the sundried tomatoes, even though I loathe them unless they're blended (so I don't have to be subjected to their baked Trojan texture). This is entirely personal preference, and I was happy to push them off to one side of the plate. The Tofu scramble, as I suspected, though, was bland. All the flavor was on the outside, because it was chopped and didn't have a chance to cook long enough for the Tofu to absorb the spices, so every bite in to a piece was a dance of nothing, curry, nothing, curry. After salting down my plate and asking for hot sauce, though, the scramble was vastly improved. And, everything is better with avocados. It's like nature's bacon fat!  Coffee here is always good, orange juice was good, although - probably not the best idea combined with coffee and a slight hangover ;). Service was pleasant and quick, even though they were swamped with Saturday brunchers, and we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table. The café has a cozy feel to it, and I honestly really do appreciate that they even make the effort to have a Tofu scramble on their menu, AND a vegan burger (which is always predictably delicious). I also appreciate the fact that a majority of their sides are vegan as well.   So, hi-five, Dairy Lane :). Thanks for having non-dairy things! xoxo"}
{"text":"Had the chorizo stuffed French toast and it was to die for.  My sister had the eggs benny and they were great too.  Home fries probably the tastiest I've had.  Adorable little place."}
{"text":"The Bison Chili is DOPE! I loved it and you will too :) Someone in the kitchen knows what's up. Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food when we stopped by on Labour Day. It was very busy though, with our wait for a table being 30 minutes, and later they were telling people an hour wait. The food was excellent though."}
{"text":"#147  I was trying this out with much enthusiasm based on the reviews.  Twenty-five minute wait was muted by the delicious coffee.  Great service during the entire visit.  Gluten-free options for the gluten-sensitive!  I had the Seared Tuna tostadas which come with 3 of those and a huge portion of BC Kennebunk fries. Very very delicious.  So, by now, you are wondering why only three stars?  Automatic two (2) star reduction for low quality condiments (no exceptions).  The cost of the higher quality condiments even in Canada is negligible and yes I have checked on the retail side.  Condiments are the Gordon Food Service (GFS) brand which have High Fructose Corn Syrup (glucose-fructose in Canada). How do I know? A search on Google revealed zero (0) results saying otherwise. Nothing on the GFS website listed anything for ingredients or natural claims.  It is 2015 and with all the different brands of condiments such as Safeway, Annie's, and Heinz has a line of condiments without this garbage in it, there are zero (0) excuses for a place of this caliber to have such low quality condiments.  Don't agree, then gluten-free should not exist either. Take me out to breakfast, lunch, or dinner and let me have some of the low quality condiments and see how sick I get."}
{"text":"A great place with excellent service and the food is top notch The only draw back is the wait so go early"}
{"text":"First impression is a small café place with nice decorations. The pictures on the wall makes this restaurant full of stories. I ordered omelet with caramelized onion, and bacon.  The brunch is good here. Fair price and excellent quality."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 8 years. Friendly staff, and amazing eggs benny! There aren't many tables so either go during a slow part of the day, or be prepared to wait.... It's so worth it."}
{"text":"Homemade delicious, yummy local cafe!  A can't miss on any visit to Calgary. We loved it so much we ate there twice during our 1 week visit to Canada. We enjoyed both breakfast and lunch menu items. Even our picky 11 year old son was pleased with his hamburger and fries which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"This is probably closer to a 3.5 but there was some good and some bad. I was meeting the lovely Stephanie S. here for breaky. I got there first and went in, as I didn't think it would be that busy on a Thursday morning...well when there is only 6 tables in a place, it's always busy. I have more seating at my house.   Was told the wait was 25 minutes and figured, screw it were already here lets wait. They herd you like cattle into this awkward back part, the layout of this place is completely dumb. Waited in a hallway until we could sit.   Menu was quite different from Blue Star, where I love going for breaky. I decided on the granola and yogurt and fruit thing.   The food took forever to come, and mine was actually last. How does it take 20 minutes to throw fruit, yogurt and granola into a bowl? It was ok. I personally hate plain yogurt, I don't see the point, they give you maple syrup, but that's also something I don't eat. Huge portion though.   None the less, I prefer Blue Star way more, and would rather go there."}
{"text":"Really tasty, well-prepared and nutritious breakfasts are worth the drive from time to time.  Ambiance is really great with the option to eat outside when the weather is sunny. The staff are friendly and very competent. As well, one can feel an easy comfortable feeling that of course is like good family. The place could be larger and therefore seat more people, as waiting in a line-up on a cool breezy day isn't all that good. With some of the others in town, Dairy Lane is well worth a visit. A weekday breakfast or lunch likely better as the line-ups not as long."}
{"text":"Good food, efficient and friendly service, but the menu itself is pretty average.  There wasn't any special dishes that jumped out at me as a must try.  The smoked salmon benny I had was tasty but I wish a vegetable side was available as a substitute for the hash.  I may have to try their burger though!"}
{"text":"Visited Calgary for a couple days, heard a recommendation about this place on the Minimalist podcast and I'm so glad my family and I stopped in! Wednesday afternoon, short 15-20 min wait. Incredibly friendly staff, we loved the girl with the pineapple tattoo!  Menu is vegetarian friendly, they source their ingredients locally/organic whenever possible. Great portions, value, and overall experience!"}
{"text":"I rolled in here on a fresh sunday morning, a winter day where it gets pleasantly warmer after a long spell of sub zero days. I was a bit late for a *cough* but before I could send an apologetic text, she beats me to the punch with \"I'll be 10 mins late...sorry\", so I naturally played it off like I was there on time all along :P  Dairy Lane Cafe is one of those brunch joints you know you're going to have to wait and despite the recommendations I've received from people, they say the wait is always worth it. The waiting itself provided a great experience. You can stand around with a coffee cup in hand and a blanket (to maybe share with) in case its too cold.  The dining room is surprisingly small but all the more active and vibrant, encouraging conversation for people who harbour the \"low Sunday energy vibe\". Their staff was very friendly and offered not only great suggestions, but humour and conversation. We shared an elk burger w/ fries, and a pan scrambler with sausages. Everything was delicious but I wasn't as inspired by other brunch cafes. The prices were quite fair.  Oddly enough I heard from a friend that this place went wayyyy back to when it was really a diner dive joint and breakfast could be bought with the change in your pocket. Is this true?"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp of course :)   it is super cute inside and the staff are friendly with a chill attitude . Service was really quick which was good as I was super hangry.  I had the tomato basil omelette and coffee and it was so tasty! The potato hash was delicious    the prices are a bit high but the quality of food is totally worth it.   Also- gluten friendly!"}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is one of my favourite breakfast spots in Calgary. Located in West Hillhurst in a low key area so I still think it's a bit of a hidden gem! Delicious food, filling portions  and great service!"}
{"text":"Needless to say, this place lives up to all the hype in the reviews. I am hesitant to leave another glowing review for this place, as it's already hard enough to get a table here, but it is soooooooo good. I don't think I'd wait an hour though. I won't wait an hour for anything as there are plenty of good restaurants. But if you can hit this place and only have 30-45min wait, and good company to chat with while waiting, it's worth it!  Everything is sourced somewhat locally. You know exactly where the food you are eating comes from as it's on their chalkboard. I'm sure you can try anything on the menu and be happy. I will say though, go for a milkshake or lemonade. The milkshakes are old fashioned deliciousness, and the lemonade was perfect!! Not that sugary crap, just perfectly refreshing.  I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Dairy Lane blows my breakfast loving mind every time!  I have a problem with Dairy Lane. WAIT, no,  that's not what I mean... I mean I have a Dairy Lane problem!  When I'm without their Back Bacon Grilled Tomato Eggs Benedict for too long, I'm pretty sure I start experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Order anything form their menu you want. You won't be disappointed.  Personal stand-out items: The aforementioned Back Bacon Grilled Tomato Bennie. It's the perfectly classic concoction. The tomatoes add this wonderfully tangy juiciness to compliment and cut through every bite. I actually get emotional with the way the egg yolk spills over the back bacon and into the english muffin below.   Things to know: It's tiny. There WILL be a line. Try go at non-peak hours if you can, but there will still probably be a line. Luckily, they help soothe my eager anxiousness with a  coffee advance, and a waiting room (hallway) in the back. Personally, I prefer to check-in and then go for a stroll through the neighbourhood. Just maybe assure them that when you all of a sudden walk off with a coffee mug, that you are indeed coming back. On second thought, maybe just don't do that at all. I'm sorry for the surprise last time, Dairy Lane. You know I love you."}
{"text":"I was visiting for a week and just wanted to grab breakfast quickly and go. I walked in thinking it was going to be mediocre and was just aching for food. I had ordered the stuffed French toast and man, was I taken back. I was afraid the berry compote and the cream cheese were going to be sugar loaded, but it was just right. It also came with a side of potatoes. The service was spot on and very friendly."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast restaurant to go to and this popped up as one of the top spots in the area. I have to admit, I wasn't disappointed! This cute, little cafe is the perfect spot for your Morning breakfast with friends. So far I have only tried the Bene-which I modified to back bacon and avocado instead of tomato, which I would highly recommend. The service is quick and friendly, and the room, although smaller than your typical restaurant, fits the atmosphere of the place. The only small issue I have is with the line up which could have you waiting nearly half an hour to get a seat, depending on how many people you come with or the time of day, but it's well worth the wait! Will be going back here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Appetizing food in a cozy cafe with a super friendly waitstaff. Our server was so nice that she even went out of the way to take a picture of my friend and I to help us remember this great experience during our trip! I will definitely stop by again on my next visit to Calgary!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, organic, and delicious!   I have been looking for some place like this for a while! Everything on the menu is purchased from local farmers and businesses. The restaurant is small and intimate and that makes it well worth the wait - You can actually hear yourself and your companions without having to talk loudly.   I had the Eggs Benedict with roasted red pepper and avocado - It was to die for! I am not sure what it is with most places in Calgary but they do not know how to make eggs Benedict right; there is usually too much hollandaise sauce, about 1/3 more food on your plate than you really should eat, combined with lame fruit or package-cooked hash browns. Some places even go as far as using a margarine-made crescent: not cool people!  I can without a doubt say The Dairy Lane Cafe makes Calgary's best Eggs Benedict!   First off portions: You get two half English muffin slices each topped with a medium sized egg, and just the right splash of hollandaise. You get all the flavor and don't feel sick afterwards for consuming 1/4 cup of butter. The fruit it came with (you can also have the standard hash browns) was fresh with a hearty portion. When I finished the meal I was full and pleased. Next flavor: homemade delicate yet tasty hollandaise, multi-grain freshly baked English muffin, locally sourced free-range eggs, fresh vegetables. The toppings (in my case red pepper + avocado, but also you can choose back bacon + tomato or smoked Salmon) were perfectly cooked and placed appropriately.  Awe yes and the coffee is fresh and a good blend, bottomless with attentive service.  So come check out an amazing breakfast Calgary!"}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is great! Its very reminiscent of an ol timey diner but with a modern twist. the Pork Chorizo burger is my go to! Sometimes I like to go carb free and do the salad and sans burger bun! I used to be not a big salad eater but this place definitely made me a convert! Mandarin Sesame Salad C'mON!    The place isn't very big but the staff are friendly and during the summer they open up the outdoor eating area and it opens up the place to alot more diners. The specials are often adventurous and Dairy lane tends to be a less busy alternative to its sister restaurant the Blue Star Diner in Bridgeland."}
{"text":"This place was a cute little cafe. They had a wait on Saturday morning when we went but it wasn't too long. The food was really good and portions are big also. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious food made with locally sourced ingredients. What's not to like? It's a great, laid-back vibe that fits the restaurant so well. I just wish it was bigger, the lines can get long."}
{"text":"Been there several times first for breakfast and then burgers.... Love everything about there... I have never tasted such a delicious Burger patty.... Little on the expensive end... but i always tell restaurant owners... charge me as much as you want, but you better back it up with Taste, Quality & Service."}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of eating at the infamous Dairy Lane Cafe. The savoury stuffed french toast was simply the best! Everything there is local and fresh, organic wherever possible. Even added touches like homemade seasonal jams. It was worth the wait and definitely a spot I will be back to in the future!"}
{"text":"We came to Dairy Lane solely based on yelp reviews (God I LOVE Yelp!) And as always we were not disappointed! I Enjoyed the Eggs Benedict w back bacon and Tomato, and my companion the breakfast Sammy.. We both loved our meals and the hand cut potatoes are cooked perfectly! The coffee was delicious and the cups never got below 3/4 full when the servers asked if you needed a refill! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for brunch based on the reviews. It is a small and friendly place. There is a 15-20 min wait usually but I would say it is worth it. Our food was really exciting and we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Our family has been coming here for the past three years now and the food is delicious!  It's a bit small and cozy inside, but this little Cafe has got a lot of heart and a lot of history(it's been open since 1950).        Because they don't take reservations, it gets pretty crowded(especially on Saturdays).  The customers don't mind waiting, though--the friendly and attentive servers quickly take your orders for coffee, tea or milkshakes while you wait.          They certainly live up to their motto, \"Homegrown and Homemade\".   My son's favorite strawberry milkshake comes in a huge stainless steel tumbler with a spoon to scoop it up.   My favorite is the Triple Double($15.75): three Sylvan Star eggs(I like mine over easy, and mine was done perfectly!), Broek pork sausage, Spolumbo's chicken sausage, local bacon, hash browns and rye toast.  My son always has the Sylvan Star grilled cheese: aged Cheddar with Spragg Farm's smoked ham on sourdough.    Hubby usually has the Eggs Benedict(2 poached eggs, smoked salmon, pickled asparagus and hash browns).    I have, on more than one occasion, cast sidelong glances at the stuffed French toast at a neighboring table, but I've never tried it yet...  I'm a bit of a carnivore at heart.  ;)          We also have to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Lane! My to-go place for brunch.  There is no parking lot for the restaurant but lots of parking on the sides of the block and right in front of the restaurant. The place is pretty small, but there is a waiting area in the back if you don't want to stand outside. They also offer free coffee for people who are waiting, I guess to help cope with the wait time.  The eggs benedict here is one of the best I have ever had. The english buns are always toasted perfectly and the eggs are poached so well! Although, they never ask you if you want the egg soft, medium or hard - you can always request it though I would think.  I have tried many items on the menu including the cold cucumber soup, mandarin orange sesame salad, the burger (topped with everything - even an egg!), the breakfast poutine and french toast. Everything is always amazing, and I never have a single complaint about the food. The service is also really great, they are very attentive but never up in your face while you try to eat.  The pricing is fair, I think it is basically standard for most brunch places in Calgary with items ranging from $10~15. My bill for two usually ends up being around $30, including tip. I think it's extremely fair considering the fact that the food is mostly, if not all, local. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"All good things come to those that must wait. And the 40 plus minute wait for our table was worth it. We enjoyed steaming cups of coffee while visiting until a table was ready for our group. Once at the table a few more cups of coffee were enjoyed.  I ordered the stuffed french toast that was filled with gooey Gruyere and salty back bacon. Delish!  The atmosphere was intimate and home-y wih fresh flowers on each table. The black and white photographs on the wall added a hint of urban nostagia. The servers were friendly, polite and efficient.  I enjoyed my brunch here and the only negative I can think of is that I lived down the street for many years and didn't experience this earlier."}
{"text":"A couple years ago my friends and I came down to Calgary to see a musical. We stopped at the now closed Nectar for a late night dessert and started talking with our waiter. We asked him for a recommendation for a breakfast or brunch restaurant  and he said Dairy Lane Cafe was the best place to go to in Calgary. The next day we drove down for brunch, but the place was packed. We couldn't wait for the time they needed (we had to drive back to Edmonton by the early afternoon) so we went somewhere else.   Flash forward to the present (well about a week ago). I'm in Calgary with another friend and for lunch I suggest trying Dairyland, because I've wanted to go for two years. It's about 2:30pm, but still in the mid-afternoon there's a 15 minute wait. I've come to learn that often if there's a wait for a restaurant it's because the food is really good, or service is really slow. Luckily for Dairy Lane it was because the food was really good.   My friend and I sat outside. I ordered a lemonade and the veggie burger. I love how the cafe uses locally produced food, and they even list the farms and suppliers where they get their food from on the menu. The lemonade was very nice, not too tart and not too sweet. My veggie burger was delicious. It was served on a pumpernickel bun with feta, spinach and a sundried tomato jam. All the flavours complimented each other rather quite well. For my side I went for the French Fries and they were they only slightly disappointing thing I had. They were rather thin, which is fine, but were not crisp. My friend ordered yam fries with her burger. I stole a couple and the yam fries were delicious. I'd definitely order those the next time instead of the fries.   Don't know when I'll be back in Calgary, but I'll definitely come back to the Dairy Lane cafe."}
{"text":"We went on a 10 km walk in and around the Kensington area. Found the greatest place for a brunch. Cool, trendy, high quality food, happy fast service sum up the Dairy Lane Cafe. A little pricey, crowded and noisy but fun.   We will be back.  BACK BACON & GRILLED TOMATO BENEDICT. $16.50 My wife loved this meal. Not too much sauce she commented.   I had the Smoked salmon, caper, cream cheese, fresh dill omelette. $17.50 plus 1 dollar for a gluten free toasted bun. Omelette was perfect. Light and tasty with adequate filling. The homemade jam was very bad. They could do much better. The bun was boring. I really enjoyed my omelette though. The potatoes were outstanding. Butter filled delights. The quality of the food was very evident and worth the price.  Cosy, fun and trendy; sit out on the deck for a better quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Did you know you can be happily fed vegan at a \"burger place\" called Dairy Lane without even having to eat a veggie burger or boring salad?   It sounds counter intuitive but it's true and not only do they have delicious vegan options but I can take my meat loving friends and they are as equally satisfied.    It's strange to describe -- it's trendy but traditional - eco-hippie-health conscious but in a neighborhood mom and pop  and still urban and almost a touch gourmet.   I've taken probably 7 people here, none of them have heard of it, and all of them say it's a terrific find and would return on their own.  My only concern with spreading the word and writing a review is it's already hard to get into and it's quite small (which is my major issue here but worth it).    I like to be ecological minded when it's easy enough to do so and DL buys from the best of local producers and organic when possible.  It's like they shop at a farmer's market every day. All their beer is small market micro brewed for example.  The price only reflects this a bit,  it's not cheap but won't break the bank either.  I've never actually done breakfast here ... usually lunch and a couple dinners.  It's \"famous\" for breakfast so maybe I should actually give it a go one day.    I'm glad they are now open for some nights for dinner but they close kind of early... it's strange to show up at 7:15 and be told the kitchen is closing soon so order right away"}

{"text":"The Dairy Lane offers a country atmosphere in the bustling city. Located right outside Kensignton, it's truly a gem. If you want to go to the Dairy Lane, I suggest going early--the lineups only get longer as the day goes on. Unless you're okay waiting, then feel free to take your time! There isn't a lot of seating, but the service and food are extremely good.  I recommend the stuffed french toast with the berry compote. It's my favourite.   The Dairy Lane is also good for people with many allergies--they are sensitive and kind. I went with a friend who has a litany of allergies, and they didn't give her a hard time about them or act like they were her responsibility (she has had this attitude at different places before). All-in-all I would recommend the Dairy Lane to anyone living in or visiting Calgary. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"Decent food but expect service without a smile or even a zephyr of amiability. The waitresses could lot seem to pull efficiency and and friendliness.  I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Yep its tiny and yep its busy but it is so good!  If I want breakfast I make sure to be there 10 minutes before they open (and there will be a line up) so I get a table right away.   This is a well supported local business and lets face it Calgary is a big city.  You aren' t the only one who will have the great idea to go for dinner or breakfast at Dairy Lane and you may have to wait.  The food is fresh and tasty and perhaps a bit pricey but that could be because it is locally sourced and high quality.  This isn't a fast food burger so you will pay the appropriate prices."}
{"text":"Always great, love the burger and fries, and fresh orange juice, that's what I love here."}
{"text":"Super cute little breakfast joint, grab a spot on the patio, wrap yourself in one of their blankets and enjoy some delicious coffee. This is the perfect way to start the morning. Inside is really tiny but since I ate on the patio it's not an issue. The menu has all the classic breakfast type fare and they use quality ingredients so everything is very flavourful. I really liked the hash browns and french toast, a carb heavy breakfast for sure but a good balance of sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane used to be one of my favourite breakfast places. It was the kind of place I would tell all my friends about and stand in the cold for. My last visit completely changed my mind.   I got the same thing I always get, the stuffed french toast with a side of fruit. I ordered an extra piece of french toast to take home to my boyfriend without any sides.   The corners and edges of my bread were incredibly stale and two of my blueberries were moldy. To add insult to injury, not only was there no discount or attempt to fix the moldy fruit problem, the server charged me the cost of a second entire meal just to get an extra piece of french toast!  All in all it was entirely expensive and disappointing. I can probably dumpster dive and find the same quality for free.   It really is unfortunate, Dairy Lane used to beat every breakfast joint in Calgary hands down but after that miserable meal I don't think I'll even give it another shot."}
{"text":"Tried Dairy Lane for the first time with my family - and while we waited outside for a table, we were served yummy hot chocolate to take the edge off the late winter / early spring morning chill. Once inside (it's tiny!) we were spoiled rotten by brisk, attentive, oh-so-friendly service, and the food is to die for. I had eggs benny (medium poached) with smoked salmon + pickled asparagus + hash browns, my wife had an omelette all-in, and my son had the four-cheese grilled multigrain sandwich with tomato basil soup. Best breakfast I've had (and that's comparing with The Palliser, the Danish Canadian Club, and Diner Deluxe). I'm most definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this cute cafe for breakfast before leaving Calgary, and I'm really happy that I made it one of my stops while I was in town. It's a charming and intimate space with very friendly servers and a great menu. I honestly wanted everything on the menu but I settled for the Mexican omelette with chorizo. It was HUGE. I loved it, and sent some of it back to the kitchen because I could not eat it all. But the really wonderful and hospitable touch here was the complimentary coffee which was delicious. I was offered a coffee upon entering, and they generously kept providing me with coffee throughout my meal. Everyone was so nice, and they even gave me a coffee to go.   Love it. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little diner! I've been here quite a number of times for brunch and have quite enjoyed my experience. I try to come here during their non peak hours but it seems like they are always quite busy. So first tip is to be prepared you may have to wait. The ambience is clean and I'd describe as a modern diner/cafe... Seating is close to others. The servers I've had in my visits are always friendly and cheerful which is nice, because often times I'm dealing with stressed servers during brunch hour at other places. I always order the all in omelette which is delicious! They also serve up different jams for their toast every so often.. Which I quite enjoy. Overall it's a cozy brunch spot with good food and service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This cafe is so cute and it has such a cozy feel to it! It is a small restaurant with seats for about 20 people so go early for brunch so that you don't have to wait too long. I waited about 20 min for 2 people but we got to order drinks while we waited and there is space to wait inside which was nice on a cold snowy day.   The breakfast menu has lots of options including hashbrowns, omelettes, breakfast burritos, avocado toast and eggs benny of course. It was a hard choice between the avocado toast and the eggs benny for me but in the end I decided on the avocado toast with added beef brisket on top - so fancy haha ($20 with the added brisket)!   The avocado toast also had kale, onions and zucchini on top along with two peached eggs and hollandaise sauce! It came with hashbrowns as well so it was a great meal! I loved the brisket - would definitely recommend adding that to your breakfast. The hashbrowns were a bit salty so I would ask for less salt next time. Overall, would recommend this cafe for sure =)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite small but cozy!  Turns over quite quickly.  Full and had a 7-10 min wait as promised by server.  They offer all fresh grown food, they have menu items that if you order the particular item they contribute a meal to a local community.    Great selection on the menu, the food has great presentation, servers were very attentive and knowledgeable.    Cleanliness was great.  I tried the avocado toast, it came with diced potatoes, next time I would order extra crispy, but they were still very tasty!  The actual avocado toast came with fresh Kale and the egg was done perfectly.  The other item ordered was the pork burger which came with fries which also would recommend extra crispy next time, but this meal was also great and exactly as described!  We ordered a to-go meal also and it came out quite quickly.  Although the price was a bit more than what you would expect to pay, the quality of the local and fresh product is worth it!  I would definitely come back multiple times!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is certainly a place worth the wait, a wonderful little restaurant with high quality food. I love that everything is local and the food is not only hearty but it makes you feel good! 100 mile diet anyone? If I could get into this place more often, I would love to make the 15 minute drive down to it.  That being said, it is such a small place. The wait is rarely short and I've come by a few times before finally waiting the 40 minutes to have a seat! Oh and the price is pretty steep but hey, it's local and tastes fantastic! If you have a little patience and really like your brunch food, drop by!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about the big \"V\".  Dairy Lane; a darling little diner tucked into the upscale inner city neighbourhood of West Hillhurst, just north of trendy Kensington Rd.  The restaurant is small, cozy and tastefully decorated.  The staff are friendly, down to Earth and eager to please; like your best friend's new love interest looking to impress. the menu is not over-done.  Perfect choices for those who want a good hearty meal and for those who want something a little more special and creative.  Everything down to the lighting is just oozing with ambiance; surely you've found the perfect little spot to bring your next swipe right!  She will think you are so sophisticated yet so down to Earth!  All is well... until your eyes scroll slightly to the right on the menu and you see the prices... uh oh.. I hope she didn't see my eyes swell... don't want her to know I'm cheap until at least the 5th date!  Look, I have no quarrels paying $300 for a dinner that is more experience then meal.  I also look forward to my next trip to Opa or MacDonalds where I can pay $8 for a delicious meal with consistently good service.  It is all about VALUE. Dairy Lane has so much to offer just down the street. However, I'm sure I am not the first person to walk out of there thinking to themselves \"This must be one of those neighbourhoods where people have more money than they know what to do with.\"    Now it has to be said that the food is really good!  All around conscious efforts to source sustainable, great quality ingredients and plate with just enough flare to dazzle and impress but not make you feel like you should have worn a suit.  The burger; outstanding!  The eggs benny; spot on! Hey, I'm sure there is more then enough reasons why this place is packed every day.  Good for them. I have to imagine though that the prices are what they are simply because they can. The VALUE is not there. I'm sorry but $10 for bacon and eggs.. wait my mistake... it's $10 just for the eggs; it's an extra $5 for the bacon. My personal favourite was on the specials board.  Wednesday's are $20 for a burger and beer. Are there really people who consider this a great deal? In this town? For a great burger? Your choices are endless!  Kensington and 17th Ave are littered with great restaurants with the same weekday special for half of that cost.  At the end of the day Dairy Lane is a great restaurant and I'm sure they will continue to do well. Good on them for having a successful restaurant business in this economy because that is not easy.  However, there comes a point in your pricing where you are no longer good VALUE for what you are offering and I think they have crossed that line. Their weekday specials are more then what most good restaurants charge on Saturday night and, I'm sorry to say, the food just isn't 80% better for, on average, 80% more money.  Bacon and eggs with coffee for 2 people should not be a $40 meal. I simply cannot justify that. The VALUE isn't there."}
{"text":"When I was in High School, the Dairy Lane was a run down diner with the best milkshakes in Calgary (bar-none) and a five minute walk from the school. At any given point in the day it wasn't unusual to see sullen teenagers waiting in line for diner food and the always good milkshakes, and best of all, it was cheap!  Nearish to my last year, they closed down for renovations. It opened up again and it was beautiful on the inside (I didn't know it COULD be clean!!) but I can't forget what it used to be. How beautiful it used to be. I get seriously distracted by nostalgia everytime I go back. So I'm biased. I want to give it three stars. I want it to go BACK.   That said, I like breakfast (+1/2 star) and I feel sustainability is the wa of the future (+1/2 star). It looks nice inside. The milkshakes are ok. I'm bitter, can't you tell?"}
{"text":"I think I've finally figured out how to enjoy brunch. Over order. Simple but genius right? Well, it was a Sunday so being in Calgary, we obviously had to go for brunch. I still can't get over how much Calgarians adore brunch - it reminds me of Montreal so much. We decided to check out Dairy Lane Café, which apparently has been in the Hillhurst  area since 1950! Wow, 65 years and going strong.   The place is tiny and packed. DLC is one of those places where you're right in the grill of your table neighbours but the chatter is loud enough that you can carry on a conversation without feeling like others are eavesdropping on you. People were constantly putting their names down on the wait list. Crappy weather meant the patio was closed and inside can fit about 20 people or so.   Arriving around noon (way too late), we were told the wait would be about an hour. At least they give you coffee/tea on the house while you wait outside. Or more like death stare the people sitting by the window and will them to hurry up and finish their last piece of toast!   - Stuffed French toast ($13.50) - two options to choose from (sweet vs. savoury) - we went with sweet. Cinnamon cream cheese and field berry compote on French bread with a side of local potato hash. We were both a little skeptical about cream cheese in French toast but the dish was well executed. Just enough that you could taste the cream cheese without it being overpowering. The French toast is huge with two slices topped on one another. The hash was good - nicely seasoned. - Eggs benedict ($15.00) - three options to choose from (bacon/grilled tomato, smoked salmon/avocado or spinach/garlic mushrooms). We went with the smoked salmon! Two poached farm fresh eggs, english muffin, house hollandaise with a side of local potato hash. The eggs were perfectly poached. Smoked salmon and avocado is a great combo. Add that with the heavenly hollandaise sauce, you have a killer eggs benny. - Marinated prawn tacos ($15.00) - this was on their featured menu. Three prawn tacos filled with roasted poblano pepper and avocado creama, cabbage, black bean pico di gallo, queso fresco and cilantro. It also is served with a side of BC kennebec potato fries. In hindsight, we should have asked to sub one of the sides for something less carb heavy (so many potatoes!) but all good, we know for next time. The tacos were excellent. The shrimp had a great flavour and the addition of beans gave the tacos additional heartiness. We had to fight over the third one, I won.   Another good spot in town to grab brunch. Heck, they're even open for lunch and dinner. Get there early or else be prepared to wait. Tip - you can wait inside if you walk around the back near the washrooms. Hopefully, next time we'll be able to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"If the Community Manager recommends this, that's golden ;)  So what better way to start the morning than with their signature back bacon tomato eggs benedict, and this was worth the price of admission, a pricey one too so this isn't for the folks who are used to eating at Knight & Day or Denny's lol.  The hollidaise sauce also just right, not too heavy and rich, in fact, would even say it was a bit on the lighter side, so bonus on saving those calories.  Eggs as fluffy as can be, chose medium.  Hashbrowns--indifferent to me, in fact, way too much, almost like American-size portions.  Easy repeat.  Thanks Dale for reminding me to write their 100th review ;)"}
{"text":"We went today for brunch and the wait was 45mins, but luckily the sun came out and we were seated outside within 25mins for the three of us. I ordered coffe and i was happy they had soy milk. I ordered the triple double breakfast. Solid meal, nothing too fancy. I enjoyed the dill on te hash browns but didnt like that they were deep fried. They gave 4 slices of sour dough bread, which is too much for my liking, but i guess if you liked the carbs then awesome. My friend ordered the chicken burger and that was delicious! Made euth griund chicken instead of chicken breast so more flavor was niceky infused, grewt toppings with it too. Solid yam fries, they had then topped with cinnamon which was a nice touch. Our coffees were comp, i guess because of the wait or perhaps they always do that. I wojld definitely go back to try othe items. I wiuld say this breakfast house is a touch on the expensive side. My plate of breakfast was 14 bucks."}
{"text":"The food is alright. I like that they use organic and local suppliers!! YEAH!!  Their drinks are very good and healthy tasting. LOL!  Taste wise it is okay...could be better.  Busy busy little place for sure!! Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for a table!! I gave this place 4 stars because of the awesome service!! But can't be giving it a 5 because the food was only okay to me for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Meh. I feel this place is overrated. Now I love a local little shop making quality food from quality, locally sourced ingredients, but I was disappointed in my burger at Dairy Lane. Mostly because it was forgettable.  Admittedly it's been a little while since I ate here, and my memory isn't what it used to be, but I can seriously not remember anything other than disappointment. The milkshake was great tho!"}
{"text":"This is a very hip cafe with an awesome crew and good ambiance. The food was reasonably priced and very delicious! I highly recommend the Eggs Benny."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Delish food and coffee. Great service. Good atmosphere. Everybody is friendly and nothing takes too long. I love their stuffed french toast, it's definitely my go to breakfast when I'm at Dairylane!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch locations I have tried in Calgary, an old and very well know small business which deserves all the good ratings they can get. It's small, so there may be waits on the weekends, but at summer time they have a small patio as well which will not disappoint you!!"}
{"text":"Small, and cute space! Had to wait ~45 mins for a table but the Dairy Lane gang gave us coffee (Fratello coffee, which is so delicious I pounded 8 cups of it in the total of 3 hours that I was there) and a place to sit in their waiting-hallway in the back.   The wait was super interesting too 'cause they have pictures and bios of some of their suppliers there. They were getting a shipment of pork that morning and I had to do a double take because the dude lugging the pork in was the same farmer on one of their posters. To know that Dairy Lane Cafe has that kind of close relationship with their suppliers is amazing!  The food is amazing too, I ate the \"Triple Double\" which had a little bit of everything: bacon, sausage, ham, eggs, and potatoes. I was stuffed and the prices are super reasonable.   Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is my go too restaurant, small environment.. smiling faces.. the only reason im not there everyday is A) my they would have to drag me into the gym B) im a student atm so gotta be frugal with my money"}
{"text":"I hate waiting for food, and most of the time I opt to find somewhere else to eat when I've been told there is a wait. However, my sister and I were enjoying a leisurely Sunday and I'd been eager to try Dairy Lane, so we waited. In the cramped, awkward back hallway with 2 chairs. It was nice that they offered us tea and coffee while we waited, but the hostess was abrupt and again, it was awkward...no where to sit or set our drinks down, and we waited nearly an hour. After finally being seated we ordered mimosas and eggs benny. We were actually getting pressed for time, as we had another appointment to make, and I was really impressed with how quickly our food came out. I was surprised to find that Dairy Lane is a sister company with Blue Star, which I love, and the food did not disappoint. Everything was good but it was a touch expensive, clocking in at $65 for the two of us with tax + tip. Not sure if I will be back - again, I'm not really into waiting almost an hour for overpriced breakfast food I could make at home. The place is cute though."}
{"text":"Amazing food, comfy  atmosphere, wait did I mention amazing food? I love this place so much, all the food tastes genuine and all the ingredients are fresh. It fill up quickly as there are 10 two seater tables so expect a wait. 100% would recommend!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure. I'm not a brunch person. I usually sleep in on weekends. And I don't like lines. Whew, now that I've gotten that off my back, let's get this review started.  I came here on a Saturday morning around 9:45AM aka prime time for brunch with two other friends. I was expecting the typical 30 min - 1 hour wait before getting seated, but lo and behold, we were seated within 20 minutes. Hmm not bad so far.  When we arrived, the waitress gave us a biggest smile ever and kindly asked if we wanted coffee while we wait for our table. Why yes, of course. Anything to make the time go by faster.  Soon enough, we were seated inside. First impression. Cozy. Comfy. But very homey. I'm starting to like this place so far.  Dining friend #1 ordered the Stuffed French Toast. The French toast comes in either a savoury version or a sweet version. She ordered the savoury version and it was absolutely divine.   Dining friend #2 ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and avocado and the eggs were poached perfectly. Another plus!  I broke out of the brunch norm and ordered the Dairy Lane burger after having read so many raving reviews about this burger. At first bite, I could also taste the smoky and delicious char on the outside of the burger. A sign of a great grilling temperature. Next, the bun. It was toasted just right. Simply delicious.  \"More coffee?\"  \"Of course!\"  My coffee was continually topped up by our waitress and never went below the 50% mark. It was as if she received a notification on her phone every time my coffee was running low. Magical.  Oh and the service throughout the meal was spot on. What a win.  Dairy Lane. You get the coveted 5 stars."}
{"text":"Small and intimate, I wanted a bacon cheeseburger to go. Their take out depends on how busy they are, which I wish I'd known before potentially wasting my time.  Fortunately, they weren't too busy when I went and I was able to place my order. However, there was nowhere for take out order to wait except in the back, around a corner, almost in the alley. Wasn't impressed with that.  That being said, the food was delicious. The fresh & local ingredients and obvious attention to detail was appreciated, and the fries were delicious! I ate about 1/2 of them on my way home.   Next time I go (and there will be a next time) I'll be sure to grab a seat and chill out."}
{"text":"Wow what a fantastic little breakfast place in Kensington! After asking many Yelpers and co-workers for great breakfast spots this place came highly recommended to me so my expectations were high. We waited about 20 minutes for a table as this is a small venue but we were able to sit outside on the patio and soak up the sunshine! The breakfast we had (Eggs Benedict) was so tasty! The servers were really friendly and I loved that while you were waiting outside for a table they would come and serve you coffee while you wait! This place is perfection, I will be back!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I hopped over to this little Kensington hole-in-the-wall after driving to their sister restaurant (Blue Star Diner) and finding renovation signs in the window. I'm glad we came here, though - this was one of the best brunch meals I've had since moving to Calgary. Cheap, it is not - I browsed a few reviews already of patrons complaining about the menu prices and affluence of the neighbourhood - but the food quality was definitely there!   We sat on the patio at Dairy Lane and enjoyed prime people watching as we sipped on waters and made small talk before our server arrived to take our orders. As this was back in August, I can't quite remember what exactly I ordered, but it was delicious. The eggs were soft and light, but buttery - read: not oily - while the meat was a tad dry and unseasoned. My friend's Benny order was screwed up, but he decided to take the Omelette that they had made instead and really loved it!  The server was very friendly and accommodating, despite the order screw-up, but the service seemed a tad rushed for not even having a line out the door. Perhaps this place could benefit from having an extra server during brunch hours. The café is small and cozy, with a beautiful wood-themed patio, comfy seats and a relaxed, easygoing ambience. The clientele consisted of chatty urbanites and youthful couples. If you're in the neighbourhood, Dairy Lane is certainly worth stopping for!"}
{"text":"It's tiny, it's cute, and it's busy even on a Monday morning. Today was my first visit to Dairy Lane. I figured a Monday would be a safe day to avoid lineups and enjoy a quieter morning meal. Though it may have been quiet by Dairy Lane's weekend standards, there was still a solid queue of people waiting for tables the whole morning.  When I got there, there were only a couple of people  waiting ahead of me. We were both in the back waiting room (yes, there's a back waiting room!). They even gave me coffee while I waited. How nice is that?  Once we were seated, our server was prompt with more bevvies and menus. I've been hearing wonderful things about the eggs benny, so that's what I got! So did one of my breakfast mates. I'm not sorry I did. They were delish! I got them with avocado and roasted red pepper. The portion was filling, and ran about $12.75 for the dish. The coffee we were drinking required some cream and sugar though. But I'm finding that to be the norm with most diner/breakfast place coffee.   If you can, I'd save your visit for an off-day too. It's a great little spot (and by little I mean they have like 8 tables total... maybe 10), but it sounds like the lineups get a little ridiculous on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and impressed both breakfasts.  The service and the food is consistently outstanding.  Great sized portions and there's variety to enjoy.  When the menu offers fresh fruit. It is exactly what it states; fresh berries and sliced citrus fruits.   So good!  The coffee is fresh and of high quality.  If you're waiting in line to dine at this little gem, you'll be offered coffee while you wait for a table.  Just another way this place makes you feel welcome!  It's a lot easier to wait 20 minutes when you've got a fresh cup of coffee to sip on!    Always friendly, professional service, and always great food to enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time but not the last time. Hard to get into but worth the wait. This tiny neighborhood cafe's menu and service puts larger establishments to shame. Try the soup and dessert daily specials, you won't be disappointed. Tonight's fresh roasted tomato soup was perfect as was the white bean hummus. The only criticism is the lack of enough pita to finish the hummus."}
{"text":"Love their burger and fries! The burger is nicely charred and the fries are fantastic!!! Service is always so warm and friendly. Sadly, this place only seats 20 so it's very hard to get a table. Be prepared to wait outside."}
{"text":"I want to rate this a 1 or even a zero so that people reading this post won't go to Dairy Lane and cause it to be even more busy than it already is!  :)  The truth is, I can't rate it less than a 4 or 5 because it's a great place!  Admittedly I've only been in the morning for breakfast, but I definitely want to make it back for an evening!  The staff is very friendly, helpful, quick.  The food is great, and often they have local items.  It's a fantastic breakfast place.  So don't go. Please. LOL"}
{"text":"Ya, it's always the places with the best food that are super packed! Sometimes if I'm in the area, I'll get a breakfast burrito to-go.  I recently had their Mexicali Omelette substituting chicken sausage for the pork. The banana peppers had a refreshing burst of flavor, although I had to spice it up with some hot sauce (my indian urge for spice getting the best of me). I'm unsure of the jam they had served, but it was a nice compliment to my toast (tasted like some sort of a rhubarb mix?!).  Until next time Dairy Lane."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  The wife's eggs Benedict was interesting but the sausage was a bit bland.  Overall okay, wishing there was a Waffle House here in Calgary."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  This was one of my favourite restaurants in town for years.  Went there yesterday after a gap of a few years and found that they have changed a lot.  Food was terrible! Both my wife and I ordered things that we've had in t(e past and they were hardly edible.  The coffee was burnt and the tea was lukewarm.  We will be giving the dairy lane a pass in the future.  Such a shame."}
{"text":"The service is awful.  I ended up leaving after 60 minutes having never received my order. Everyone around me had their  food. Last time I was there, the screeching kid made my ears hurt we were sitting so close together.   again. The food is good, the rest needs a lot of work"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in total and the last time I had checked out their newer location bc my 2 year old daughter was with me and she's a challenge to take out to eat. She almost toppled over the table in their older location so this time I opted for a bigger location. Anyways service is amazing, food is amazing. I love their salmon egg Benedict. Getting seating could notorious but what do you expect. I'd go their again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  So tiny and adorable, but I believe that it's long line ups are a good indication of how delicious it's  breakfast is. I will occasionally hop over to Dairy Lane with my Dad, or my coffee loving friend who adores that they actually serve decent coffee here. I find that if you come in groups of two, you get in faster than other larger groups, which is slightly unfortunate, but I'll live with it for delicious eats. The wait generally doesn't last too long, and you're provided with coffee, and blankets if its particularily chilly I used to frequent for the vegan tofu scramble, but it would seem it's changed slightly and is now a little spicier than I can handle for breakfast.  However, I now like to go around lunch for the delicious black bean soup, and the super hospitable server informed me the garlic toast was also safe for me to eat. I love this little gem."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane Cafe uses reusable energy, recycled products & organic foods. The available seating space is quite limited so you might be forced to wait for a table with a hot cup of coffee outside. The food was incredible with a large portion size. Whether you're a visiting tourist or a local resident, I strongly suggest you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Wow, I just had an awesome breakfast here and wish I hadn't waited so long for my first visit.  The weather was amazing and I was lucky to be able to sit on the sidewalk patio.  I must say, the traffic is low enough that I was able to enjoy my visit and meal without distractions from vehicle noise and exhaust fumes.  I also liked that they provide blankets to sit on if you find the metal chairs too uncomfortable or cold.  I'm glad I wasn't sitting inside because it was very busy and noisy.  I had the Mexicali Omelet with multi-grain toast, which also came with hash browns.  Everything was very flavorful, so I took my time eating it so I could actually finish it all.  I didn't want to leave anything behind!  I thought it was reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of food."}
{"text":"It took no less than the estimated twenty minutes before we finally sat down, but with so many people to patiently wait along side with and the promise of a scrumptious meal to look forward to, queuing in front of Dairy Lane on this lazy Sunday afternoon wasn't so bad after all. In an attempt to lessen the wait time, we agreed at check-in to take a take inside or out, but almost regretted doing so as we realized how unexpectedly chilly it was. The patio diners seemed happy enough though. Not even everyone was using the cozy-looking blue blankets that were provided. Luckily, we got a table inside.  Two waters each (why I'm not sure, but we weren't going to make a fuss) as well as coffee (with a side of milk) and tea (with a side of soy) were brought pronto to warm (and wake) us up. The benedicts we opted for - mine with smoked salmon and pickled asparagus, my brunch date's with avocado and roasted red pepper, both with medium eggs - were just perfect. Simply sided with tiny little cubes of crispy home fries and a gooseberry garnish, the dishes were deliciously filling.   Besides the varied menu, fast and friendly service, and cozy decor, the fact that Dairy Lane sources almost all of its ingredients locally and organically leaves pretty much nothing else to be desired (except for the ability to wake up earlier to beat the crowds)."}
{"text":"We got lucky sitting down before it got crowded. Small place. Small kitchen. Not a place where you want to eat and go. More of a social type, take your time place. Get to know each other. Ok now for the food. I got the brisket egg Benedict, which was good. More of a traditional style Benedict. No special sauce that you can say wow to. Wife got the omelet and that was ok also. We were happy of the potatoes. The place is clean and preparation of the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here spur of the moment based on reviews. When I walked up i wasn't sure if it was open because it was so dark, but I could see someone through the window. Charming spot, only 10 small tables. The menu was small but varied. I was pleased to find a vegan option and there were several gluten free friendly items. Staff was friendly. The specials and feature menu had some really good look options.  And they even sell artisinal locally made jams. I had the vegan scramble and everything was flavoured and cooked well."}
{"text":"Excellent eggs and Benedict! The kitchen was happy to accommodate the alterations I made to my breakfast. The hash browns were good but a little too salty for my friends taste. There was a large drink selection and the menu was pretty extensive considering how small the diner is. Definitely not meant for a large group it was busy enough when we went in at 930 am on a Tuesday. Can't imagine the line is short on weekends."}
{"text":"I am glad Kat and I got married in August. I could imagine bringing her here for breakfast on our anniversary, and standing for 45 minutes in a blinding blizzard - not my idea of a fun time. The Sunday we came down here was a typical busy period, with a half hour wait. We were offered refreshments while we waited in the cloudless sunshine, and we played Sudoku while our tummies grumbled back and forth in a noisy competition to determine who was the hungriest.  Finally, when we made it into the restaurant and ushered to our quaint little table, we were surprised at its size; tiny. Maybe 500 sq. foot tiny. And the turn-around at tables was impressively quick, a system honed through the generations. The decor was loads of fun, and a blackboard above the kitchen listed the local locations where their fresh ingredients come from.  Needless to say, you could tell the difference local makes. My Tex-Mex omelet was fluffy and succulent, and Kat's eggs benedict were perfectly done, runny as she likes them. It was a great breakfast, and I would definitely come back to try their other offerings. Perhaps take up Dan's recommendation of the burgers?  5/30"}
{"text":"Delicious! Today I had the pleasure of having the chicken club and it was on point. The pesto mayo, avocado, bacon and chicken made for a great combination. The sandwiches usually come alongside either fries, soup or salad. Naturally, I went with the yam fries. I was absolutely in love with the aioli that accompanied it. Best part about it, is that breakfast is served till 3pm (which is rare for diners) and they are opened straight through the day into the evening. The restaurant itself is quite small and I can only imagine how busy it gets on weekends. I love that its in quiet neighborhood and has that home-like feel. Hopefully they have a patio in the summertime, which I can already imagine myself sitting at on a beautiful day. Look forward to my return."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is located in a cute Kensington area on a nice quiet street.  It was an enjoyable experience having breakfast solo but I truly enjoyed just reading my book.  As others state in their reviews, it's a rather small restaurant.  I visited on a weekday and scored a spot on the patio.  The weather was perfect to have breakfast with the sun shining.  Not too cool and not too warm. I love that they provide soft, fleecy blankets if you need to keep warm!  Nice touch!  The menu isn't large and I love that they use local products.  As much as I read about the stuffed french toast, I really wanted a savoury breakfast.  So I settled for the 2 eggs w/pork sausage meal.    Everything was cooked to perfection and quite enjoyable.  The food didn't take long and service was quick and efficient.  The coffee tasted great and was constantly being refilled - always a plus for breakfast!  Another plus are hashbrowns - they were warm and crispy which are key in my books.  I will return to try the stuffed french toasted because it looked and sounded awesome!"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: This small breakfast nook punches waaay above its weight in both food and service.  Try: Eggs Benedict w/ brisket & caramelized onion Eggs Benedict w/ avocado & grilled tomato  Pro: The service is a step beyond what anyone could reasonably expect. One of us had to take a call before the eggs benedict were served, and they (without request!) remade the eggs after the person came back so they'd be fresh.  The eggs benedict themselves were excellent, and on par (!) with the Primrose at the Rimrock in Banff. The brisket was tender and juicy, and grilled tomatoes were done just right.  Con: None! The prices are justified by the quantity and quality of the food."}
{"text":"The novices in north american cuisine we are tried for the first time the famous eggs benedict, and it was absolutely delicious! I prefered the ones with spinach and sautées mushrooms, I think that the smoked salmon hides the taste of the eggs and the hollandaise sauce. The hash browns were well cooked and soft inside, the grapefruit was tasty. The presentation was nice. On Saturday morning-lunch, it seems really busy (they put you on the list and you wait for 30-40 min) until 1 am."}
{"text":"I'm you're number one fan..... OK, maybe not the best Kathy Bates impression but I am certainly a fan of Dairy Lane Cafe!! It's a bit small so get there early for breakfast, early for lunch and early for dinner.  They use locally sourced, fresh ingredients and I like that.  My mom is in a wheelchair and they were very accommodating giving us ample room in their tiny dining area.  The staff are friendly and attentive; I never saw the bottom of my coffee mug.  I ordered a large bison chili.  It was a tad bit pricey ($13.50) but not outrageous.  The chili was great and was the perfect portion.  My mom wasn't as fortunate with their seasonal soup though.  I believe it was some sort of cream based potato soup.  Her soup lacked a little flavour.  All in all our experience was good and the food was a great value.  I'd definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"First time dining at Dairy Lane Cafe. I got the French toast while my partner had egg benny. I would definitely choose the egg benny next time as it was delicious with the salmon and avocado. The French toast - felt as if it was too much carbohydrates and sweets for a breakfast meal, would have liked more fresh fruits with that plate. Overall it was delicious! :) Had to wait around 20 minutes in the morning, you can enjoy coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"Dairy lane is a very cute diner, and is quite convenient and close to where I live. I live on the same street as the owners and they seem very kind. The milkshakes at dairy lane are amazing. I love the vanilla milkshakes. And all the food is amazing too I can't choose my favourite!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend around 10am, just before the rush hit, and there was a 20 minute wait. It was a beautiful day though and for those of you who can't operate without caffeine in the morning, they offer you coffee while you wait  It's a small space though so you have to wait outside.... I imagine it's not so fun in the mid winter!   The atmosphere is cozy and friendly. The service is good and my coffee never went empty.  My husband ordered the breakfast burritio which he really enjoyed. I ordered the DL hash with added mushrooms and brisket. It would have been a great hash without those things as well, with lots of ingredients like sauteed kale, grilled zucchini, cherry tomatoes,  bit of fresh grated cheese and poached eggs with hollandaise. The mushrooms and brisket just made it a bit richer and filling so I could make it last for 2 while meals! It was delicious and with a bit of hot sauce to cut through the richness I had created, it was a perfect breakfast for that day!  The bill didn't kill me considering we both had caesars...expensive with no specials but so good! They use quality ingredients for it (I find some places water down the clamato too much and use bad quality garnishes) which makes it delicious... but heavy enough that you only need one :P  I'll definitely be back to try some other items! Hopefully the coffee will keep me warm while I wait in the cold of winter lol"}
{"text":"The pork burger was only second to the atmosphere and service.  I simply love this place...so much so I would fly back from San Francisco just to eat here."}
{"text":"Get here early. It packs out quickly on the weekends, with a long line of people happy to wait it out. Great quality, great price. And a place where we could easily stick to our low carb diet kick. Very friendly. Have become a devoted regular."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane.  Kind of sounds like a business that delivers milk to your door, doesn't it?  Well, it's not.  It's actually one of the best little breakfast shops I've been to.  They have a HUGE breakfast menu, which is served all day long.  I just love all-day breakfast, it's my favourite.  And Dairy Lane certainly hits the top of the list for that one.  They've got all different sorts of dishes from healthy ones to super greasy ones.  You can get your basic fried eggs and ham, french toast, eggs Benny's, yogurt and granola, or even the classic breakfast sandwich.  Careful now, a lot of their food is a little messy, sloppy, or hard to eat, but well worth the mess.  One of my favourite things is that they actually advertise on the menu that you can substitute your usualy hashbrowns for half a grapefruit, fresh fruit bowl or fresh tomato.  I absolutely love that!  They also have a great lunch menu with a bunch of different burgers and sandwiches.  I've only ever tried the breakfast stuff (because I'm addicted to breakfast) but the burgers all look huge and quite appetizing.  I'll stick with my breakfast, thank you very much!  Seriously, Dairy Lane is one of the cutest places ever!  It can get a little crowded, though, since there's only seating for about 20, and usually a bit of a line.  It's well worth the wait to enjoy a meal at Dairy Lane, though.  Hello new favourite breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I heard that they had a great gluten free menu and I had to check them out. Dairy Lane did not disappoint! We sat on the patio and enjoyed the last few days of summer and the staff was accommodating, knowledgeable about what items were gluten free and very happy to suggest items. The burger I had was AMAZING as were the sides. You can tell the difference in quality between their food and regular restaurants and it makes me want to eat locally sourced more often. I'll be back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try out this restaurant and there's always been a long line-up or it's raining cats and dogs.  This morning, we had the opportunity to finally eat at this restaurant.  The wait for our table was not very long, about 20 mins.  Free coffee was provided while we waited.  Soon, our table was available and service was quick.  We ordered:  - Eggs Benedict with Avocado and Roasted Peppers - eggs cooked to perfection - poached soft was the style we ordered and that's what we got!  Love it!!  Came with these wonderfully roasted potatoes - nicely seasoned and not oily at all!    - All in omelette - I was told that it was fantastic and packed with lots of meat.  - 2 eggs plus side of avocado - cooked to specifications  - Coffee - good  When we left, there was a wait line of 10 people.    Note of interest:  the cafe has been opened since 1950!!"}
{"text":"What a great little find! Breakfast, Dinner... It's all good here. The service was fun and the intimate diner style atmosphere was perfect for getting out on an early Saturday evening.   The food came out hot and fast and was quite delicious. The value for the money was great too."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! But please don't tell anyone, it's too busy already - lol Seriously, in all four seasons, people line up for breakfast and lunch outside. So much so that they have blankets and coffee urns and heaters. It's just that good!!!  Local ingredients Organic Fresh Flavourful Quaint Cozy Fun Lively Topped with a serious helping of AWESOME staff  The tables turn over fairly quick so take a chance and wait - you will definitely be happy you did.  Nice small menu. Daily specials I think they even have gluten free pie every day now.  These guys just know what good food is all about. Keep it simple and flavourful - HOMERUN!!!  Ok, remember, I said don't tell anyone else!! Got it!!"}
{"text":"Oh man!  After hearing so much about Dairy Lane's Burgers, my expectations were pretty high. And I gotta say ... they lived up to the hype.  It is exactly what you want (or at least ... what I want!). Super fresh ingredients (mostly, if not all, local I might add) and perfectly seasoned, delicious meat. Well worth the price you pay.  The decor is adorable. Such a cute little restaurant. VERY clean. And the place is ALWAYS packed. For good reason.  The service is really good too. Friendly, well balanced. Classy.  I like Dairy Lane because you are getting really good quality food, very well prepared in a quaint, friendly environment. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dairy Lane is probably one of my most favorite breakfast joints in Calgary! A friend of mine recommended Dairy Lane and I'm so glad he did. The food is super delicious and made from the finest local ingredients. They even have a list of all the local vendors they get their ingredients from, and the list is intensive! I had ordered the smoked salmon benedict with avocado and I was blown away with the quality of the dish let alone the presentation. One bite into my dish, and I've fallen in love! Definitely in my top 5 breakfast joints, I love it here and will be coming back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for breakfast, lunch or dinner, Dairy Lane will give you one hell of a delicious meal!  Have brunched here and was very happy with my avocado and roasted red pepper benny, but the burgers! Let joy be unconfined. I had the Dairy Lane Burger today and since I had not eaten anything prior, decided to add everything on it.  That is right, I added: bacon, cheese, mushrooms and a fried egg. This burger was so very, very good. I think even if I had been stingy and just eaten it with no extras, it would have held up nicely on its own. The bun itself was delectable, I am trying to think how to describe it, like a cheese, savoury bun, OMG it also was able to take the pounding my burger toppings gave it.  I think Dairy Lane deserves a big plus for their menu's accommodation, you can get gluten free buns, and they actually have vegan dishes. So nice to see a brunch (and dinner!)  able to ensure all its guests have a great meal.  Another big plus is it's licensed, I will never say no to a nice bottle of beer to wash my burger down.  This place is very small though, so be sure to arrive early or at off times. We came for a 2:30 lunch on a Friday and we almost didn't get a table!"}
{"text":"What a lovely cafe/diner!!! Service was spot on...not annoying nor were we ignored. We went on a Saturday evening and it was not too busy. Nice selection of food and bevies.  They even know what Vegan means! Wonderful not having to explain that Vegan is not Vegetarian nor is it Gluten free!! Thanks for your  knowledge.  We both ordered a different Vegan burger....with fries!!!   The only comment I make is that the burger needs more juiciness with its fixings. Maybe pickles in the burger or more mayo...some zip....the patty was ok...held together nicely wasn't crumbly or dry...a very nice dark bun...and the fries were thin and tasty.  I am always looking for the perfect vegan Burger...this might be a 6/10.   Add some mushrooms??? A vegan Cheese slice? Bread and butter pickles? more tomato? Something to juice it up.....  On the up side I am happy that it was Vegan and I did not have to alter the order and ask a million questions to determine if it was ok for us to eat!!!!  THANK YOU DAIRY LANE!!"}
