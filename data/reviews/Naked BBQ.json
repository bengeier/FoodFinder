{"text":"A fast casual, yet high quality, great tasting BBQ restaurant is something you don't find too often, but this place is the real deal. Simple menu, yet had all of the classic BBQ staples you would expect. I did the two neat plate, ribs and brisket plus beans and Carolina cold slaw with some cornbread to top it off. All five items were delicious, and you can tell great care went into choosing the ingredients and cooking the food. Highly recommend, my only complaint is that they don't have one in the east valley where I live :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best pulled pork sandwich...ever!! Great family run business with delicious food. We liked it so much I bought brisket and pork to take home to my husband.  This is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Food is great and the owner is very nice and generous. He gave our family 2 different desserts to try and was doing the same with every table. The sauce is super good! The kids really liked the Mac n cheese and everyone loved the maple bacon donut."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT bbq!! I salivate just thinking about the awesome not overpowering smoky flavor & moistness of the brisket. The mac & cheese is also very good...homemade, no boxed crap here! I literally crave this food!!   I also love the decor. Very cool atmosphere. As a matter of fact, I'm on my way back over there now to buy a pound of brisket. :)"}
{"text":"THE most delicious bbq I've ever had! and the owner is the nicest person; he greets you every time like it's you're first time there, yet you're the best of friends. the brisket, hot links, and the ribs are the perfect meal. sides are great, but why bother?"}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ.  Just go early or the meat will be gone!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. First of all my kids giggled for about a good 20 minutes when I told them where we were going. We stopped by on our way home to LA.   The service was awesome. Oren, the owner, is the man. Everyone is super friendly and the line zips along briskly.   As for the main event, it did not disappoint. I'd recommend the brisket, which was perfectly smokey and fatty at just the right amount. We also got a sample of the turkey, which was out of this world juicy, which I did not expect for BBQ turkey. The ribs were also real thick and meaty. Can't go wrong with any of those. Overall though, it operates at the speed of a fast food place, with kid friendly atmosphere, but seriously legit BBQ that you'd expect from a much more expensive place. New favorite BBQ place."}
{"text":"Great new St. Louis style BBQ place in Scottsdale. I just came back from St. Louis business trip last week where I had what I thought was the best BBQ ever.  Naked BBQ was just as good..... but more reasonably priced. My husband and grown son went crazy over it!  Try the sliced brisket!!!!!"}
{"text":"First experience wasn't that good everything was cold except for the macaroni which was cold on top and hot on the bottom. The pork was tender but didn't have much flavor this place got high rating so I will given it another chance. I hope it stacks up to its ratings I'm all about the mom and pop shop places and not about chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"Wow! Hubby and I came here for lunch today. We split the 2 meat plate with brisket and pulled pork. For sides we had mac n cheese and bbq beans. The fatty brisket had so much flavor. It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. It's served fast and the quality is great. It's a hard pick what's my favorite bbq this place or hek yeah bbq. Either way this place is amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to there location at i17 and bell rd and I'm always happy with the quality of food and service. The Scottsdale location I was not disappointed and enjoyed my lunch."}
{"text":"Meat was great, although a tad greasy. Serving size was adequate. A nice, casual dining experience."}
{"text":"BBQ on the northwest side is not common. If you are coming out to this area though I would recommend going to BobbyQ instead for a better overall dining experience.   First let me say the meat here is decent. The sides my husband and I had were not that good. We arrived at about 1:30pm. I ordered the  1/2 rack of ribs and a banana pudding. My husband ordered the one meat plate. He got the pulled pork with slaw and mac & cheese. We sat at a small table. There is about seating for 30 total in the dining area.   The ribs I got the meat was lightly smoked. I would have liked a more smoked taste but the meat was nice. I tried the sweet, spicy, mustard, and vinegar sauces. The sweet is a traditional Memphis-style sweet sauce. The spicy sauce tasted just like the sweet so I think the wrong sauce was in the container. The vinegar sauce was good. The mustard sauce was not that great. It tasted too strongly of yellow mustard. I had better yellow mustard BBQ sauces when I lived in North Carolina.  My banana pudding was okay. There were no banana in the pudding. It tasted as though it was made from a store bought mix. It was also quite thin. The restaurant looks like they have no spins so it was hard to eat.   My husband got the one meat plate. He wanted a corn muffin. He was told they did not have any warn muffins. That they were quite child and he didn't seem interested in trying to heat any of them even though we indicated we were willing to wait. So he got the mac & cheese and creamy slaw.   My husband said the pulled pork had no flavor (no smoked or seasoning). He said it was just like eating shreded meat. The mac & cheese was over cooked and bland. The creamy slaw was not creamy. It used very little mayonnaise. Again, there was very little flavor. My husband also got the peach cobbler. It was a bit tart. It could have used more sugar.   As I was sitting and finishing my three star review we got to talk to the owner. He was quite nice. We offered some suggestions and he brought over some of the sides. They were MUCH better than we initially received. We will come back and give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Best bbq at great prices and awesome customer service. Everyone should give it a try."}
{"text":"Really tasty bbq. I had the pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese. The meat was tender and juicy and I topped it with the spicy bbq sauce which was great.   After reading other reviews I did not have high expectations of the sides. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese. They make it fresh when you order it, which I had not seen it done before. My friend had the beans which she did not enjoy at first but after she added some bbq sauce, it was top notch."}
{"text":"We had the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches with potato salad, beans and cole slaw. The kids had sauce on theirs but my brisket needed nothing. Awesome BBQ and a clean restaurant. Will go back next time in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried Naked BBQ for the first time today and everything was delicious! We tried the brisket and the pulled pork, both were items we would get again. The homemade pickles were sweet, the cornbread was fresh and the bbq sauces were both a good pick."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good BBQ in our area and found Naked BBQ only a few miles away. The location is slightly hard to find in the evening but so well worth it. We walked in and were greeted by the staff who gave us details on how long the cook the meat, the options and gave us samples to try before we decided on what we ordered.  My boyfriend ordered the brisket and ribs with a side of smoked potato and potato salad. I ordered the hot links and pulled pork with the sides of coleslaw (creamy) and potato salad. They were both ... How do say!?! .... AMAZING!!! The meats were so tender and moist, what a great idea to let the customer do their own sauces on the meat to their liking!   We both enjoyed our plates of goodness and the staff brought us other samples of meat to try. Most likely to bring us back and boy did that work! We are looking forward to going back and trying other meat & sides! We both enjoyed their Caroline coleslaw and it did pair well with the pulled pork (they recommend you try it before you order it)!   Do yourself a favor and get your naked BBQ on! You'll feel good inside & out!!"}
{"text":"This is really good stuff! I've been to a few pulled pork sandwich places but this is definitely one of the best. The meats not too fatty and the buns don't get all soggy.  Plus the homemade pickle slices are awesome. I don't write reviews but this place was pretty good"}
{"text":"It was a co-workers birthday and she wanted BBQ... I saw that this place had some really great reviews so we decided to place a catering order. Everyone really enjoyed the food. The meat was good, not too smoky, and the sides had great flavor.  A couple of things I want to say though...the chicken, although good was basically sitting in grease so when we had leftovers it was completely gelatinous, but regardless good. The mac and cheese had a great flavor, but it was more like cheese soup with noodles...it's all about the roux guys!! The one thing that a lot of us did was take that cheese sauce and mix it in with the beans, and that was really good! The beans were unlike any baked beans Ive had before, very good! As stated from a fellow reviewer, the buns are perfect. You can make a nice and heavy with meat sandwich and it won't fall apart. I put the coleslaw on the pork and it was perfect! We will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"had lunch at the bahn mi bistro down the block and thought I would stick my head in here and check out the brisket. i fully expected to be disappointed when I ordered just 1/4 pound of fatty brisket, sliced. the gentleman went back and grabbed the meat from a warming box, and hand sliced me a 1/4 pound, putting it in a cool little box. $5.91 and out the door. in the car, my wife opened the box, and with her dainty fingers pulled a piece from within, put it in her cute little mouth, and moaned with delight. I tore off a piece and chucked it down. talk about good, it was beefy, smoky, tender and juicy.  all the things good BBQ should be. we will be back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ at both locations. Good portions. The owner goes the extra mile. The burnt ends are spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix that I've tried. And yes I've had Bobby Q's as well. First time here we had a pulled pork sandwich and a brisket sandwich. Both were moist, delicious and just the right amount of smoke. Each sandwich comes with one side. We tried the creamy cold slaw and the Mac and cheese. Definitely pleasantly surprised. They do their own pickles which are great as well. We went back after we ate our sandwiches to try the ribs. So good! I had the maple bacon donut for dessert, AMAZING! I can't wait to come back and try the prime rib dinner. (It's only offered Fridays and Saturdays after 5pm)"}
{"text":"Great food. I tried almost everything and the only thing I didn't like was the slaw. Meat is not dry and has a great smoked flavor. Will be a regular lunch stop for sure!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food is the service. Nice to see an owner know how to treat his customers. I go out of my way to eat here. You should too."}
{"text":"Delicious. Amazing. Delicious. Incredible. Did I mention DELICIOUS?! Best damn BBQ in town, hands down. From the meats to the homemade pickles to the watermelon iced tea, (and everything in between) Orin, the owner, is running a ridiculously fantastic affair over here. Do yourself a favor and get over to the Naked BBQ NOW!"}
{"text":"Love the BBQ here! It's delicious the sauce is also excellent. They even offer a gluten free bun which is awesome for celiacs like me who just need a pulled pork sandwich every once in awhile. The staff is so sweet to make sure nothing is cross contaminated and this will be a favorite for years to come!"}
{"text":"Delicious brisket, Turkey, and ribs. Two items really stood out to me. The brisket was juicy and a delicacy. The turkey was excellent and smokey. Great flavor. The home made sauces are great as well. Loved the corn bread and that the size was not huge. It allowed for a really perfect bite with fabulous texture.  I think the beans could be better. Could just be I like more of a BBQ kick in beans. Macaroni noodles are cute but could use more cheese kick. I am nitpicking because this BBQ is great!  The real sting is that the location is hard to find and without the internet I don't think it would be an easy find. The other is that it is in North Phoenix. I hope they build one out in Chandler. Those lines wrapping around the block at Joe's BBQ and Little Miss BBQ might relocate."}
{"text":"Excellent! Everything we had was delicious! Had the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, potato salad, beans, muffins, and chocolate chip cookie. Everything was sooooo tasty! And the staff was wonderfully friendly. Nothing but good things to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great food and enviroment. Love the smell right as you walk in. Very friendly staff is very accomidating. Could eat it daily"}
{"text":"I love this place. A friend introduced me to this place a few months ago and I keep coming back. The food is fantastic! The price is fair, the meat is spiced perfectly, there is a nice selection, and the spicy & sweet  BBQ sauces are very tasty. And to top it all of the staff is polite and hard working! My favorite BBQ place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We lived in Kansas City for 15 years and know good barbecue.   This is good barbecue!"}
{"text":"Ordered for a work group of 10, the owner was SOO nice and extremely helpful with our order. The food is AMAZING. I am very picky when it comes to bbq and this place definitely makes the cut. The brisket is my recommendation, next time its all we are going to order, not because anything else was bad but just because it was so good!  Our order came perfectly put together and he knew exactly how much food to make us, we were all stuffed! I highly recommend Naked BBQ to anyone looking for some really good BBQ!"}
{"text":"First time here and wasn't disappointed! I got the chopped brisket, mac & cheese and potato salad! Everything was amazing but the mac & cheese was amazing and I could eat a plate full of it! Sweet tea is perfect! Staff is super friendly! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best bbq food in this corner of Scottsdale. I had the brisket and ribs, mac n cheese and slaw. Everything was delicious. Very reasonable price. Will return."}
{"text":"Ooooooh Nelly...    Was here Super Bowl weekend, was literally stalking the place...  The brisket, turkey, ribs, sauces, it was all legit...   I live in Ca and have been having withdrawals since...   Looking for excuse to get back to Phoenix and I think Naked BBQ may be it.."}
{"text":"OMG... Finally a great BBQ restaurant in the Valley! Tender smoked perfectly, sliced brisket, yummy cornbread!"}
{"text":"Cute modern BBQ joint, quick service. Staff is abundant, helpful, and friendly. I was asking several questions about the sides and they were informative and offered samples. Menu is layed out like chipotle, pick as you go to make a meal. I had the turkey platter with potato salad and coleslaw. Meat was fresh, moist and slightly firm bbq style, good portion size, and served dry with BBQ sauce self-serve on the side. I pretty much only eat turkey meat and this one was grade A! Sides were fresh and not overly creamy or salty. One doesn't often think this about a BBQ joint, but I left feeling great! Meal didn't feel \"heavy\" but I was definitely full. I would most definitely come to this place again. The restaurant was very clean also."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for a over a year and if you haven't been, you must go and get naked at NAKED BBQ! Everything on the menu is delish! The smoked brisket and pulled pork are legit! It was so tasty that I couldn't resist ordering to-go to share with the family! If you have room and want to satisfy your sweet tooth be sure to order the maple bacon doughnut. Amazing! Looking forward to my next visit..."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding even for a picky BBQ eater like myself. Excellent customer service, great quality food and just a good old fashioned great eat. After several times eating at Naked BBQ, I have never had any problems with their staff or quality of the food.   Their brisket is amazing, nice bark and smoke ring. Their pulled pork melts in your mouth and has a great smokey taste. Their turkey is just out of this world good. The sides and BBQ sauce are great too.   My only complaint is I wish they were open 24/7 when I get a craving for BBQ late at night. ;-)"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Naked BBQ this weekend was exceptional! We tried almost everything and loved it all! The ribs and brisket are awesome and I love the naked concept. The service was also really good - very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be going back!  I hope they open more locations!"}
{"text":"As the owner of Dankys Bar-B-Q,  I can honestly say that whenever im on the otherside of the valley Naked BBQ is my home away from home. Spot on brisket! Keep it up boys, Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food!  So good, plan ahead!!!!  When the meat is gone, the meat is gone!  They will close up shop and you will have to come back.   I recommend stopping by for lunch not dinner.  :) Service is great.  Nice choice of sauces if you choose.  Naked is my preferred choice. It will become one of your favorites too!"}
{"text":"Awesome brisket! Awesome staff! Great restaurant. Always busy, but still fast service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well i just visited Naked BBQ for early supper and found the place with no problem.  I ordered the 2 meat platter with Sliced Brisket and the chicken with Mac n Cheese and vegetable of the day ( Collard Greens)  Let me say that i was excited when i read some of the reviews prior to coming here but kept in mind everyone's taste buds are different.  So i try the brisket, it was pretty tasty expect for the large pieces of salt and pepper that was rubbed on the Brisket.  If you bit into either of the two it will destroy your palate. So next i tried the chicken, it had a little kick to it; it was OK, if i came back i'd probably not get that again.  So on to the sides.... the Mac N Cheese was average at best, needed to salt the water a little more or flavor the cheese sauce a little better.  Now to the greens... I asked the staff before ordering the Collard greens who made the greens they stated the owner.  I'm not sure who/whom showed the owner how to make greens but  he or she needs to keep trying.  They had a pretty good flavor but they weren't cooked long enough and had waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy too many stems in it.  Being from the Midwest and a mother and father from the south, i do know what greens supposed to taste like and that wasn't it; sorry.    I may be back or maybe not."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place!  It's quick and the meats are awesome!  It's kind of laid out like a chipotle, where you walk in and order then take your food to your table.  (I didn't know what to expect when we went in.)  I had a pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend had the brisket sandwich.  While both were good, the brisket wins!  The potato salad is really good, the Mac n cheese was good once we mixed up the cheese from the bottom, and the sweet tea was awesome!  Also try the house made pickles and their spicy BBQ sauce.  While the sauce wasn't spicy, it was very good.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but the food and service at Naked BBQ were so unexpectly amazing that I just had to share.  When I pulled into the strip center (who could resist the sign on Bell Road??) I was expecting a run of the mill sandwich.  Instead, I was greeted with an eager staff and the tastiest BBQ I've had in a long time.  My dear friend Trevor moved to Dallas a few years ago.  He had been smoking meats with his father and grandfather for decades and it had become his family's signature hobby.  Every couple months he would have a bunch of us over so he could share his family recipes and we would get our fill of brisket and pork and all the fixins.  When he moved, I thought I would have to go to Dallas to experience the same yummy BBQ.  Sorry, Trevor... you've been replaced!  Naked BBQ has the same \"spent all week getting it ready for you\" kind of experience.  I can't wait to go back.  And I'll definitely be taking Trevor the next time he visits!"}
{"text":"Portions are small, sides are flavorless, and the BBQ itself is very average."}
{"text":"BBQ is hard to find in AZ. Search no more!  Cows, pigs and chickens better find a place to hide because naked BBQ has you in their sites. Great food, friendly staff and great owner. We had the beef and pork and for dessert we had blueberry cobbler and Mabel bacon donuts!!!!   Try it out and you will be pleased as we were. Great job NBBQ"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch after a spring training game. It was delicious and quick. The brisket, hot links and chicken were all great! Not only good food but also good and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is my first review...and it is so worth the effort to write it! I went in to Naked BBQ to order takeout for my husband and me. I ordered 2- two meat combos for us to share. We had pulled pork, sliced brisket, ribs and spicy hot links. Sides I chose were beans, potato salad, cole slaw and Mac and cheese. As someone from Kansas City I have been yearning for some decent BBQ in this area. FINALLY.....I have somewhere to go to get a taste of the homeland. The meat was juicy and delicious...and since it isn't drowned in sauce you can enjoy the meat then add the sauce later. And the beans...that is what I judge BBQ places on...and these are amazing. We will be back for sure...."}
{"text":"My lady & myself just stopped in to grab some bbq. I won't rable on about our dining experience. I will simply say that the sliced brisket was overcooked and dry. The ribs were the same. The portions are small for the $$ price. Will not return..."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for lunch. It's located on Bell Road, a busy north Phoenix thoroughfare in a car dealer ghetto just off of I-17. I could smell the place before we got into the parking lot.  I knew those would be good.   I got a chopped brisket sandwich and a cup of potato salad. Friend ordered pulled pork and grilled broccoli which I coveted, even though there was nothing wrong with the obviously homemade potato salad, I'm going for the veggies next time. I had no regrets about the brisket which was smokey and tender. A variety of sauces stood at a continent track which I sampled sparingly to avoid covering the smokey goodness of the brisket.   We were having family over that evening and had planned for pizza. Making a command decision, I  bought a pound of pork and a half pound of brisket. At home I laid the meat out on a plate to warm in the microwave. The brisket had a nice red smoke ring, with tarty scorched ends. The pork was tender, pleasantly stringy, and succulent, even after being refrigerated and microwaved  Naked Barbecue is one of the best two barbecue jointed I've sampled in Phoenix. Of you're looking for authentic slow-smoked barbecue, I suggest you Go Naked."}
{"text":"2nd Best bbq I've ever had in my life lol it was good very hearty loved the homemade pickles brisket hot link turkey pulled pork and ribs VERY GOOD!!! Great customer service as well providing a at home feeling. Good stuff guys great way of showing true taste of meats and not just smothering them in sauce (star TYPO) lol"}
{"text":"Great Barbecue! Since I moved from Atlanta, I've been looking for a good BBQ place.  Prior to Naked, I'd only found a couple good places, and none of them in Scottsdale.  The pulled pork had really good flavor, even without sauce.  The brisket is also really good.  Stop by and check it out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ joint in town! I love the brisket and hot links, and my kids eat up the smoked turkey and Mac n cheese. No matter what you order it will be delicious. The chocolate chip cookie afterwards is the perfect treat. The staff are friendly and helpful too, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and friendly service! Well worth the money! There were 3 of us a each of us got a different sandwich. We had the pulled pork, chopped brisket and smoked turkey and they were all great. We really liked the sweet BBQ sauce and vinegar based sauces. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm from the South, so I have had a lot of BBQ. I have to say that the food here is solid! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simply come to this place. But get here early! Great food, great service. These guys do it right!"}
{"text":"I placed a catering order with Naked BBQ for my husband's birthday party and they were extremely professional, moderately priced and the food was nothing short of exceptional."}
{"text":"first let me say that the owner Oren is a stand up great guy, one of the friendliest I have encountered at any restaurant!  The BBQ here is better then any BBQ i have had in town, and as someone who does BBQ, i like to think i have a pretty good prspective!  Brisket is super juicy, great smoke, great smoke ring, really great crust, its money!!!!  Ribs are awesome, nice and meaty St. louis ribs, smoked pork & chicken were also on point!!  i like to mix their sweet & spicy sauces together and dip all the meats and lick my fingers to the bone!  Naked BBQ is a legitimate 5 star BBQ restaurant here in the valley, i cant say that about any of the other BBQ joint in Phoenix.  my hats off to you guys, great job!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious, so glad I stopped in! The pulled pork was very tender and really tasty. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!  Sauce is on the side so you can taste the extremely flavorful and tender meat - that's why it's Naked!  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The owner is obviously proud of his meats and will be glad to give you samples. Brisket is tender and flavorful. Same with turkey and pulled pork. Really like their bbq sauces and happy they have a mustard sauce to boot. They also have a vinegar sauce if you prefer. All in all great food and friendly service. Try it you will like it. Some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and wonderful customer service super friendly and the food speak for its self!"}
{"text":"Had the brisket...........way too salty.  May give it another try if I can stop drinking water from all the salt.  Ick."}
{"text":"Best barbeque brisket I have ever eaten. The owner, Orin, told me he smokes the brisket for 15 hours over special wood. And the result is so good, you don't even need barbeque sauce to enjoy it. But try the spicy sauce - not too sweet, not too spicy, just delicious. I am so glad I live near-by!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went there by looking at the reviews on yelp and I will definitely recommend it. Friendly worker and great food"}
{"text":"The meats are good. Was our first time and was able to get some samples before diving in. The spicy sauce was yummy. Sides were also good but the beans needed something so added the sauce and made all the difference. We Will be getting naked again in the future."}
{"text":"Customer service as A+. Had sliced brisket, Cole slaw, beans and corn bread. Corn bread had no flavor, coleslaw wasn't very good and could tell the beans were cheaper quality and had too much spice/cumin. Beef brisket was ok, small portion and very fatty. Guess I'm spoiled with my friends BBQ team. Best part was service and sweet BBQ sauce. Not sure if I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Great meat here.  Not as impressed by the sides.  The sliced brisket is my favorite, then the ribs, and pulled pork. Spicy sausage was great as well.  Need to try some other stuff next time but will probably get the brisket again.  Mac and Cheese was ok.  Beans are gravy based.  Potato salad was pretty average.  Slaws are good.  They have both a creamy and a vinegar based slaw. Wish they were closer but will stop in when I'm in the area.  I'd post a pic but we ate it all."}
{"text":"Good chopped brisket sandwich. The bun was cold but the meat was moist. Liked the mac and cheese. The watermelon tea hit the spot too."}
{"text":"First visit. I'm always looking for something new on this end of town and today I wasn't disappointed. I pulled in a little late for lunch, about 1:30, and was a little concerned because it seemed pretty quiet. I went in, was warmly welcomed, and placed my order. I tried the sliced brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, and beans. The platter also had a little corn muffin. The brisket was spot on. - moist, smokey, flavorful. The pulled pork had great flavor and texture. I doctored up the pork with a sample of the spicy and sweet sauces. Both nicely complemented the pork although I preferred the spicy sauce. The slaw was creamy mayo based savory, not sweet.   Probably my only misgiving about the meal were the beans. The beans were a bit flat. Need  some salt an/or vinegar. I dumped some of the spicy BBQ sauce on them and they  were perfect.  I thought about knocking the rating down to 4 stars because of the beans but that seems pretty weak-assed to know down a bbq place because of the sides. So 5 stars it is.  I was disappointed that they were out of cobbler. I believe cobbler is the perfect finish to bbq meals so I will be back to get the full experience."}
{"text":"So good. Might be best brisket I ever had! Amazing.  Sides were great too.  Glad it's here and close by."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant while visiting Banh Mi Bistro for the first time. Upon seeing the great reviews on Yelp, we decided we needed to check it out next time we went out for lunch. We arrived earlier than our friend we were meeting. While we waited, we were offered samples of each of the meats. This actually made our decision on what to order more difficult as we enjoyed each one! So, we decided to get two, two-meat platters so we can try as many as possible. My hubby went with the Pulled Pork and Sliced Turkey, while I ordered the Pulled Chicken and Chopped Brisket.   Each of the meats was smoky, tender, and tasty. The Pulled Pork was slightly sweet and not too salty. The Sliced Turkey was moist and surprisingly delicious. I never would've thought we'd order turkey at a BBQ restaurant, but it was our favorite of the meal. The Pulled Chicken was also very good, though it was a little dry towards the end of the meal. Using a little of the four available BBQ sauces helped to alleviate that, though (the spicy sauce was our favorite).  The Chopped Brisket was super flavorful and juicy, and needed no sauce whatsoever. It was perfect as it was.  For sides, we each ordered the Carolina Slaw and Mac & Cheese. Both were fine; not bad but not spectacular. The cornbread muffin was warm and soft; an enjoyable end to our meal. Portion sizes are ample and worth the price ($14 for two-meat platter). Finally, the service was great; everyone was very friendly and willing to answer any questions we had."}
{"text":"Simply the best!  Excellent food and service.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for something to eat.  My new go to place for BBQ."}
{"text":"It's great to have fantastic barbeque in the neighborhood. The brisket is superb and the ribs are wonderful. You can't go wrong with food like this and it is so convenient and with quick service too. I really enjoy their sweet sauce that you can apply yourself."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, Aaaamazing bbq. I had the brisket, it was perfect . The dry bbq seasoning was bomb, sweet and their spicy bbq sauce was so good.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a new bbq joint to avoid going to our same spot every time. We got here at 7:20, it wasn't very busy (most people that came in grabbed their food to go) but it's a nice little place with wonderful and positive attitude from all the employees.   The food was great though it could have been a little warmer. The brisket was incredible tender and the pulled chicken very juicy.   My dates chicken breast was a little dry and the Mac and cheese looked kind of like watered down cheese.  The cash register prompting me for a tip when I was paying felt awkward and I gave a 15% tip even though it was just a checkout register.   The cost is a little on the higher side, $15 for two meats and two smaller sides compared to Famous Daves, but we both enjoyed our food and will likely be back."}
{"text":"Born and raised in the Carolinas, I know good BBQ and southern fare. This is the best in Arizona. Eat here, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Landed and needed food.  Found this place on yelp and was very happy after the meal.  Clean and good service!"}
{"text":"I got the two meat plate, pulled pork and brisket. Both were fantastic. I was impressed with the friendly customer service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here!  We had the brisket - super moist and the full of yummy flavor goodness!  Sides: Mac and cheese and beans.  Then they offer house made pickles - Oh. My. God.  Beat pickles ever and the perfect contrast to the filling BBQ.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We set out purposely to try this place after seeing it online and it was worth the 30 minute drive from the far west valley. Loved the BBQ. The meats were all excellent and we will definitely be back to see Oren. He even gave the kiddos the last bit of bacon doughnuts he had as an added bonus. Just wish he would open a place up here in the boonies :o)"}
{"text":"Oren catered our wedding a few weekends ago. We must of had 1/2 of the guests tell us it was the best darn bbq and the best wedding food they have had in their life.   I'm happy Oren and his staff were AWESOME to our guests and shared our wedding day.....oh and the food....6 STARS!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! I've love bbq and Naked Bbq is definitely my new go to place. Excellent taste, excellent quality, excellent all around. Best of all excellent price."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite BBQ in Phoenix. It's easy to miss driving by but definitely worth stopping in. My favorite is the brisket but I haven't had any meat there that I didn't like. Mac and cheese is great as well."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Naked BBQ location on Bell so when I found out that they were opening a second location I was thrilled.  My usual order is the chopped brisket, mac & cheese, and a corn bread muffin. I'm normally a purist when it comes to BBQ sauces but at Naked I love their sweet sauce.  I went with co-workers on a Friday at lunch. Things do get a bit busy after 11:30 so get there early if you can."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was bomb!! The Mac and cheese is to die for"}
{"text":"I want to also add that the sliced Brisket is out of this world. I will be back many times because they do an amazing job!"}
{"text":"Jumped off the bike to avoid the rain. Wow, food was amazing. Fantastic brisket and friendly staff. Hope it keeps raining so I can stay for desert. Mac and cheese was equally good, pickles tasted homemade, warmed BBQ sauce is the new standard."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ joint.  Almost like being in the South.  Only complaint I would have is that they aren't open in the evenings during the week; they close at 4PM or whenever they run out of BBQ."}
{"text":"BBQ runs through my blood, even though I'm Asian, BBQ is a part of me.  Since moving to Phoenix, I've pretty much have been to every decent BBQ joint in the valley.  I would put Naked BBQ in my top 3.  I obviously have a loyalty to Little Miss BBQ, but this place is pretty damn solid.  So I've been to the original  Naked BBQ off Bell, so i was extremely pleasantly surprised to find one here.  So my lady and I were at Banner Health for the delivery of our baby.  Since I was there for three days, i wanted to get some Portillos and see what else was in the area.  So as I soon discovered N. BBQ, I had to give this location a try.  I ordered the two meat plate, chopped brisket and smoked links with beans and mac and cheese.  The brisket was smoky and had a great flavor and the links were on point.  Crisp, meaty, and had a nice little kick at the end.  The sides were great, beans were delicious and the mac and cheese was awesome. I remember bringing it back to the hospital room, every person in the room asked what was that smell of that food from.  Overall, solid BBQ. I would highly recommend this place.  Thomas"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their staff is quick and friendly. No matter what you order your tastebuds will always be delighted. Cannot wait to go back again! Thank you Naked BBQ for all the amazing experiences I've had"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and the environment is fun! I always have troubles deciding so I have to go with the combo plate with brisket and ribs to start. Be sure to try all the sauces! They have one for just about every taste!"}
{"text":"Just moved back from Texas where I really started appreciating barbecue. So glad to find Naked. The pulled pork and sliced brisket were extremely juicy and tasty. Nice sized portions!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. They serve during lunch time and until the meat runs out. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"amazing! worth every penny. the pulled pork is the best i've ever had. eat here."}
{"text":"Ok... been there 4 times now and finally getting around to writing a review.  This is now my new favorite BBQ place in town...and not too far from my office!  Chopped Brisket and Pulled Pork are my favorite, however, I tried the Hot Links today and they were very good as well!  One thing to try is their boneless rib sandwich (on special)...AMAZING!  Unfortunately, it's not an everyday item.  Maybe if enough of us request it, it will be one day ;)"}
{"text":"Best bbq I've ever had! The brisket was perfect and the Mac n cheese perfecter. I think I'm an addict now"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ with its own distinction and it's own flavor. Owner onsite makes for a great service and the overall staff is friendly and helpful. But honestly, you all know that what really counts is the actual food - and in my family's opinion - it's top notch! Don't skip the desert!!!! P.s. The BBQ sauce is incredible!"}
{"text":"BEST BBQ EVER. Staff is always super friendly and the service is fast. As long as I live in Phoenix I refuse to get my BBQ fix anywhere else. I have tried almost everything on the menu and it's never dried out and is always flavorful - I would recommend everything but my first choice is always the pulled pork sandwich. Yum!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This hidden gem is amazing. The staff is welcoming felt like I was walking into an old friends place. The food... mmm mmm mmm ok the food is great. I recommend this place a thousand tine over."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Sad I'm just finding this gem. Tried the brisket, hot link, & pulled pork. Brisket was amazing. I eat alot of brisket, like alot. My doctor gets mad about it, and my doctor is going to stay mad cause this place has some of the most tender brisket I've ever eaten. Melted like butter in my mouth. Hot links had great flavor and good bite, and the pulled pork tasted great with an after taste of a spice. The Mac and cheese and sauces were also top notch. Great food. Will eat again.   Additionally the staff was great. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hubby and I wanted bbq. Once u enter the place u understand the concept: simple, straightforward, and clean. This place is wonderful because the meat is legit with healthy options. I had salad with brisket on top. The romaine was crunchy, crisp and really dark green.  I got a mix with kale and I appreciate them lightly steaming/blanching the kale so it's flavorful than when it's raw (dry). I choose jicama, red peppers, rainbow cherry tomatoes, and cukes. $9. I wanted to try their ribs so I got 2 pieces for $4. Fabulous. Others wrote it fatty but I'm ok with it. It falls off the bones. Hubby got salad brisket as well with a side of their mac and cheese. Small side is $2. People might complain about their mac but I see it more on the healthy side: not too cheesy dense-it lightly covered the bases. The ice tea is freshly brewed with 3 varieties: unsweetened, sweetened and watermelon. I appreciate this because I hate the processed Nestea crap and other commercial flavored teas out there. There was thought put to everything."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work.  I love their brisket and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Most delicious bbq around! The chicken & pork are so juicy & full of flavor, didn't even need sauce. The corn bread, Mac n cheese & coleslaw are our favorite sides! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I don't like shopping plaza restaurants...but this place is super clean the staff friendly and most importantly, the barbeque is really good. I had a half rack with two side and the ribs are excellent...the sides could be kicked up a bit. Overall, this is a great find"}
{"text":"Went for lunch the place was fairly busy. All of us had the two  meat , half sliced brisket half chopped brisket.The meat was tender with a good smoke to it. the flavor was very good. Didn't care a whole lot for the coleslaw it needed more flavor a little bit plain. My friends had the bean side and they said it was pretty good. I would go back again with no problem. Slightly pricey though."}
{"text":"This place should be called \"Bland BBQ.\"  I ordered the 2 meat platter with ribs and turkey and sides of coleslaw and mac & cheese. Before  going I watched a video showing how they prepare the meat for smoking...it showed lots and lots of rub.  However, on my visit last night there was no rub whatsoever on the ribs.  Further, they did not remove the membrane from the ribs - rookie move.  The ribs were basically flavorless.  The turkey was a bit better...lots of smokiness but a bit on the dry side.  The sides were both totally tasteless.  It's a good thing they don't put BBQ sauce on the meat because it's more like BBQ syrup...overly sweet and runny. I had high hopes since this location is so convenient.  No reason to go back."}
{"text":"So ten months later and I've eaten here several more times.  I still love their brisket, but it's really not the star of their show.  The real star is the turkey.  I don't really even particularly like turkey, but their turkey is so amazing they pretty much ruined Thanksgiving forever.    Still not blown away by sides though - still don't really care that much."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Brisket was amazing. I love their sauce options, all were great and mixing here and there was great too. Great buns on their sandwiches and extra friendly service. Coleslaw was good but the mac 'n' cheese was a little dry and bland. I will definitely be back and will get more meat types and try more sides."}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ! Brisket was amazing and everything else was just mouth watering. Kids killed it."}
{"text":"Really good place. The BBQ is really testy and service is great. If you are in Phoenix, Arizona and want to try a good BBQ restaurant this is the place to go. Believe me it's great"}
{"text":"I grew up on a large hog farm in Iowa and have always loved BBQ.  Consequently, I seldom miss an opportunity to savor this special fare so when we noticed the new joint we had to stop in.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  The time was 7:50 pm and we were shocked to learn they were closing in 10 minutes.  What. BBQ restaurant that sells beer closes at 8.  We ordered the two meat plate just to sample and see if we wanted to return.  The brisket is average as is the mac and cheese.  Cornbread again average and no butter offered or served with it.  The turkey however was exceptional and they deserve some kind praise for a great smoking job.  Moist and delicious.  As we finished our meal we watched them turn customers away starting at 815 pm and that's a horrible business decision for any new business.  The owner needs to wake up and stay up for at least another hour.  Crazy.  Anyway we will give it another try and see what they have accomplished with their pork."}
{"text":"Brilliant BBQ, which though the situation is improving is still not easy to find in the valley.  The brisket was moist without being fatty and very flavorful.  The sauces were good, though the quality of the meat made them non-essential.  The mac and cheese (a must-have for any good BBQ, if you ask me) was quite rich and tasty.  Finally, the staff were all very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is excellent barbecue, take it from a Texan one thing I know is great barbecue. The brisket is tender with a good smoke flavor and smoke ring and don't bother with the sauce it doesn't need it. The hot links are delicious as well, absolutely do not miss the pickles and onions they are done in house and are delicious."}
{"text":"Just finished up lunch here.  Really good, honest BBQ.  OJ (owner) was quick to provide us with some samples.  They were all really good.  I'm especially a junkie for turkey since it's really tough to keep it moist.  Man it was good.  They even keep the cheese sauce separate from the macaroni to keep the mac and cheese creamy.  All the meats had a really good but not overpowering flavor.  A thinly sliced homemade refrigerator pickle was the only item i missed.  Way to go OJ."}
{"text":"This is the reason that I give 4 stars for a good restaurant experience. What do you give a restaurant like Naked BBQ if you've given all the others 5 star ratings?  This is what I have been waiting for! A great BBQ experience in Phoenix.. woo hoo!  Best of all, this is the nicest and most sincere kitchen crew in the valley. Thanks! FIVE STARS."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE!! It should be a sin to put any sauce on the brisket, it is a work of art on it's own!  BBQ done the right way, and I can get a beer with it? Even Better!"}
{"text":"Delish bbq. Our 1st time here. The pulled chicken sandwich is grest. The green beans are yummy. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  The staff is mostly good. The girl at the register with stretched ears was extremely nice, some kid who looked 19 was someone whom basically took up space and filled sides, and the tattooed gentleman, whom I believe was either manager or shift, is someone whom I took a very strong disliking to. To be fair, he was just trying to make sure I knew what I was ordering. I don't enjoy condescension, however. I asked for Carolina Slaw as one of the sides, and he asked if I knew what that meant. Most people from Arizona don't know different barbeque types or slaw types, but I did spend several years in North Carolina at a school regularly ranked higher than ivy leagues which also has a great basketball team, and I also have family in northeast Tennessee, so that question did honestly bother me a bit, as the sides weren't even on the menu. I asked for Carolina Slaw, so I know what it is. I don't need condescension with my meal. I know what I am ordering, and I don't need someone who probably has never lived in the south, can probably not make a good rub for smoked ribs off the top of his head, and can probably not tell me the various differentiations of barbeque within the US or outside its borders. He is, however, now my \"brother\",as I learned as I exited, which seems possibly fortuitous. Maybe he can visit my family and learn what some country cooking in the Appalachians is like.  Good food, unfortunate and condescending interaction from a tattooed brodiot (trademark pending). I would give a five star rating, if it was just the food. I'm sure the chicken is good, but when I don't order the smoked chicken, I don't want to deal with a cock. My name is Stirling Peters.  Edit: Oren, whom one may ask about catering is very polite and very quick at a response for prices and recommendations. I was impressed by him, at least.  Edit 2: Oren is a genuinely good customer service representative. I have changed my review to a 70%. By happenstance, the reviews are just out of five, though. I won't do 4/5, which is 80 percent. The five star system is not my problem. I don't care for poor customer relations in-store, and as kind as my email acquaintance named Oren may be, I stand by the rest of my review until I see less of the male chicken in-store.  Cheers, all.  Again, my name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"Delicious! It's one of those places that they have what they have until they run out. Try the turkey for a BBQ change. Crowded at lunch, not too many tables."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  I have been there 3-4 times and had a great experience every time.  I usually go with the sliced brisket (not on the sign, just ask for it) sandwich.  Brisket has been spot on every time.  The owner has personally came to my table to ask about the food every time which is a rare thing these days.  I need to try the hot links next time!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Period. One review said not worth the money... bs! Brisket, hot links, chicken, turkey, pulled pork -they make their own pickles! Everything here is delicious and the portions are BIG - you won't leave hungry or unhappy."}
{"text":"Solid, flavorful BBQ done right.  This sides are top notch.  The owner genuinely wants to make sure you are satisfied.  A must eat place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a placeholder review but wow food was great and Oren made us feel welcome!  Try the watermelon tea!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I picked this place solely based on the reviews here on yelp. I must say that I was not disappointed. The beef brisket was tender and delicious. I loved the barbecue sauce. Baked beans were well seasoned and the mac & cheese was creamy yet not salty.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"As a certified KCBS BBQ judge, I always rush to try a new BBQ restaurant when I hear good things.  Well, some top notch BBQ just hit the west valley.  The owner's name is Oren and he has a real passion for BBQ.  He is only open weekdays at 11:00 am until the meat is gone.  I had a little taste of everything and I can say without hesitation that all of meats are worth ordering.  I was fortunate to show up on a Tuesday and had a taste of the Tuesday special tri-tip which was probably my favorite of all of the offerings.  The turkey and chicken were both spot on.  Ribs and pulled pork were both among the best in the valley.  The brisket was fantastic and the sausage was very tasty.  It is hard to believe it's only been open 5 days.  Oren is still tinkering with some of the flavor profiles so I can only imagine what heights he might reach as he continues to perfect his craft."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. The pulled pork with authentic selection of sauces was as close to replicating NC BBQ as any I have found in AZ."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a couple of weekends ago when we had alone time from the kid.  It was dinner time and the place was empty at first, but filled up quickly and had a positive buzz and a number of other happy people like ourselves. Next time we will bring the kid.  I had the two-meat platter with sliced brisket and shredded pork.  My sides were the potato salad and green beans.  I had the sweet and smoky BBQ sauce and my wife had their shredded pork sandwich with a spicy BBQ sauce.  Both were great, tasty, solid BBQ.  You could see the smoke rings in the meat and it had just enough char to enhance the flavor without overpowering it.   We enjoyed out meal, the sides were good.  The potato salad was standard, decent, nothing to write home about but was good with the meal.  The special veggie was garlic green beans and were also good - could have been cooked a little more.  We had the huge chocolate chip cookie for dessert, which was just crispy enough on the edges and chewy in the center.   Also, to the reviewer who lamented that this place was the \"The gentrification of BBQ continues in N. Scottsdale with Naked BBQ\", check yourself.  How pretentious, and at the same time stupid, can a person be?  Are you sure you know what the word \"gentrification\" means?  Scottsdale is, in the scope of all things, a new town.  Up until a few years ago you had to go to downtown Phoenix for anything resembling BBQ outside of the McRib.    Naked BBQ is my new favorite place.  I wanted to like The Thumb, but they keep tripping up on customer service.  Their food is comparable, but the price is higher, and the counter help couldn't be less friendly.  The staff at Naked BBQ welcomed us, talked us through our selections.  I look forward to going again, soon."}
{"text":"Holy smokes(pun intended) this place is awesome! Come put the south in your mouth. No matter your preferred style barbecue they have you covered. All the meat just starts out plain, smoked and you add spice and sauce to your liking."}
{"text":"We showed up with a big order for an office meeting and they were SO nice and helpful! Everything was ready very quickly and the food was delish! Brisket was so juicy and I loved the Cole slaw! Some of my friends had the Mac and cheese and they said it was the bomb! Great place,  great service, and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on our way back to Scottsdale. Place is very clean, and staff was overly nice. The menu, covering the basics seemed a bit boring. Tried the pulled pork, beans and mac and cheese. The pork was good, the mac was very good, the beans were dull and flavorless. I can't imagine anyone ordering them for a second time ... the corn muffins were dry and bland. As nice as this place looks, it is just lacking in character. Boring menu and bland food.   Hopefully they can switch things up because the place and staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese very good. BBQ, just ok."}
{"text":"Very good.  The meats are flavorful.  We tried the sauce but prefered the taste of the.meat naked. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy.i like that they let Hou have a taste of rhw vinegar based coleslaw before you buy it.  It was not for me but my fiance enjoyed it.  Fast and friendly. We will return"}
{"text":"This has quickly become our favorite BBQ in North Phoenix. The brisket is the best day to day menu item and all of the sides are a must try. We recently ordered their Thanksgiving meal and was blown away with how good the smoked turkey was. What a great deal and the perfect way to have your turkey smoked, by professionals!  It was moist with this amazing smoked flavor. We'll be making this a staple for Thanksgiving's to come."}
{"text":"I tried this place from a recommendation from a friend. I ordered a few pounds of the turkey and the brisket. The turkey was very moist and full of flavor. The brisket was ok but not the best as suggested. Priced a little high for the quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Tasty and great service to boot. The pulled pork was moist, flavorful and the Mac and cheese is hearty. The staff is friendly and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!  The sweet BBQ sauce was amazing and I put it on everything.  Good size portions as I got the two meat platter ($14) with two sides: sliced brisket, pulled chicken, veggie of the day (broccoli), mac and cheese and a small corn bread muffin.  The only negative I have is that the cornbread muffin was a tad dry but nothing a little of the sweet BBQ sauce couldn't fix.  Past reviews have complained about the mac and cheese being watery at the end, so I let it sit and saved it for last, adding some of the sweet BBQ sauce to it.  Phenomenal.  Brisket was delicious, good smoke flavor on it, chicken was juicy, and as I said before I would use that sauce on anything."}
{"text":"BEST BBQ I've had! The owner Oren is super friendly, as is the rest of his staff, and knows how to smoke'em! My family and I have yet to get something we don't like. Get there early for lunch because when the meats gone so are they. When you're there, pay attention to the customers leaving and offering their thanks and when you're done thank them as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall! The ribs are great... moist, large, tender. The brisket was great... moist, tender. Only wish is was \"pinker\" but that my hangup. The choices of home made sauces are fun to try."}
{"text":"First, I love barbecue so. Second, I love any place that serves you a pile of meat on a tray. I am a simple creature.   Naked BBQ was fun, fast, and tasty. The staff was ridiculously nice and fun. As for the food, the sides are bit lackluster and need a bit more of a spicy punch or additional creamy, fatty goodness.  But, that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here. We tried four options, and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most. Pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well. Overall, it was a fun, casual lunch with the before mentioned meat on a tray. I would totally stop by here for lunch or a brisket pick-up adventure again."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Quick service and the owner is very accommodating.  If you haven't tried Naked BBQ you are truly missing a great meal!"}
{"text":"I got the 1-meat platter, which was a good portion of food. I chose sliced brisket, which turned out to be a tremendous choice. The brisket was well cooked and deliciously seasoned.   As you may guess by the name NakedQ, they serve their meat naked. They have sauces that have good flavor, but the brisket tasted best naked.   If you like pickles, their homemade pickles and onions are an absolute must.   My sides were beans and green beans (today's vegetable of the day).  The beans were mediocre, which is the only negative I have to say about this place. The green beans were good and worth ordering. Whenever I come back, I will probably get the veg of the day and try something different than the beans. The cornbread muffin was acceptable, but to be fair I have never found any cornbread to be amazing.   The prices are fair compared to other BBQ restaurants and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place (try the sliced brisket!)."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST BBQ I've ever had! Once you've eaten naked, you'll never be the same again!"}
{"text":"Very Very Yummy BBQ, Only thing I hate is that they Slop the Meat on a Piece of Paper on top of a Metal Tray, Very gross I think. They r not real Cheap so I would think they could come up with some \" Paper Products\", other then that I will be going back. P.S. Stop watering down your BBQ Sauce"}
{"text":"Perfect location to make everyone happy.  They accommodated our soccer group at the last minute and everyone left full and happy.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a different option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Chipotle style ordering with helpful friendly faces and giving plenty of suggestions and recommendations. We tried the turkey on a salad, the 2 meat platter with 2 sides, with brisket, chicken, Carolina slaw, and green beans. There was a ton of flavor in everything and I didn't feel like I was eating awfully. All the food was to die for. All the meat was smoked and and had a rub but NO BBQ! I love this concept. I got to try them with a few different warmed BBQ sauces that they keep on the counter so you don't have to trouble an employee for multiple flavors of another serving.   The owner was walking around asking how everything was and seemed like we really took our recommendations to heart.  I'll definitely be back. I'd cone at least once a week if the meat was organic or non-gmo."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and the food.  We recently had Naked BBQ cater a party for 80 people and they did a fantastic job.  We had pulled pork, pulled chicken, mac n cheese, baked beans, and green beans.  Everyone loved the food.  Oren, the owner, was a pleasure to deal with and went out of his way to accommodate us and our catering needs.  I highly recommend this place and the food."}
{"text":"I loved my pulled pork sandwich. It was very very good ! they have a spicy vinegar sauce, Carolina style which I really appreciate . However I always eat my pulled pork with coleslaw. I ordered Carolina style.... It was horrible! I had a half inch of vinegar floating at the bottom of my cup. Totally turned me off. However there are several other side  dishes. I  know what to not try again, but I certainly will come back here. The barbecue was phenomenal."}
{"text":"As many have commented and I agree, the food is outstanding but the prices are too high and the portions too small.  I will continue to patronize but not as much as I hoped due to poor value proposition."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The brisket and ribs are to die for. The staff very friendly and helpful. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing but this is the 3rd time I've came and they are closed always closed . I come around 3pm and I'm always confused when they are open . They need to sharpen up on the times . So people like me don't drive an 45 min only to go to Dickey's down the street which isn't that good."}
{"text":"I proudly wear the \"I love BBQ but it better be good badge\".  We picked this place based on Yelp reviews and close proximity to work.  Wow.  Everything about it is fantastic.  The meat is cooked perfectly, the beans have a little kick, the mac and cheese - while runny - has a fantastic flavor.  The buns they serve are nice and firm so when you pile high the meat and sauce, they hold up until the end.  If you like BBQ, go here.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, but had high hopes! After finally deciding to give Naked Q a try with the family, we were greeted warmly by kitchen staff from the jump. They offered suggestions and a cool history of the place, as well as a reminder of their other location.  We ordered some of everything - brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, beans, cornbread muffins, Mac and cheese, and potato salad.  The brisket was exceptionally dry with no moisture whatsoever. The pulled pork was equally dry. The coleslaw leaked a thin, watery liquid onto the metal tray. The beans tasted very old. The cornbread muffins had clearly been out for hours, hard and crumbly. The Mac and cheese had zero cheese; just simply dry cooked pasta. The potato salad was equally dated, having no flavor at all.  We even tried their \"peach cobbler,\" which was stale, over baked, and clearly used canned peaches and way too much cinnamon.  After spending $45 dollars for the dinner, we waved goodbye and resolved to take our business elsewhere.  Nice staff, but there were no other patrons in the restaurant on a Friday night. I think they reserve their best food for maybe Saturdays?"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Brisket is the best.  Ribs ok.  Melt in your mouth.  Beans rock.  Kids loved them.  Prime rib very good at the #2 spot."}
{"text":"The meat literally melts in your mouth. I came in during a time it wasn't busy and the staff that took care of me was extremely nice. This was my first time so the staff gave me the option to try the burnt ends, pulled pork, and sliced brisket. The brisket and burnt ends are absolutely phenomenal. The pulled pork is delicious and has a little vinegar component to it, but if you combine it with their spicy BBQ sauce it cuts the flavors perfect and it is absolutely delicious. The corn bread and the sides are obviously fresh and made in house and I would recommend this to others and will definitely definitely definitely be coming back because it is hard to find good BBQ in the Phoenix area. Amazing!! It's located in the strip mall that looks quiet but definitely a hidden gem! So good!"}
{"text":"If you want true Texas smoked brisket. Try this place hands done the best BBQ in AZ.  Absolutely everything in this place is amazing. Try the homemade pickles."}
{"text":"I love this place. It takes about five minutes to figure out that the entire staff is committed to what they're doing. Excellent service, food, and a clean place to eat. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in again tonight to pickup a bounce meat platter. I've been in a few times since my last review and just now decided to update my review. DAMN I LOVE THIS PLACE! There review updated. Really though every time I go in service is great and the food is consistent. I've have tried other places and none have matched up to the food or service here. Don't just take my word for it look at the other reviews. They are so good they had to get a sign saying when the meat is gone cause they sell out yes they will run out of meats cause they don't mass produce large quantities and though it in the fridge or freezer. This is probably why the meats always taste great and always consistent."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. I think watching them and how they interacted with the customers was one of the best aspects of our experience. They were kind and courteous and very attentive. The owner was talking and asking how our food was and he is a super friendly and honest person which sets a nice precedent for a healthy business.   In terms of the food I like the fact that they leave off the sauce to give us the full meat experience. I liked the ribs and pulled pork. Sauce wise, the sweet sauce was probably my favorite. The spicy takes a bit to get that burn feeling but pretty good as well. The brisket was tender which was nice as well. We did get a couple of hard to chew pieces. Personal opinion is that the brisket was overseasoned with salt on the outside. Sides wise, slaw was good, potato salad was ok. I like that they served broccoli with garlic. Their mac and cheese needs work. It was pretty much pasta in cheese soup. The corn bread was not overly sweet but a bit small to my liking. Overall I would return if I needed a close by BBQ fix"}
{"text":"Terrific food! some of the best barbecue ever -this is a must go to place. And no,you don't have to take your clothes off as you enter the door!"}
{"text":"Been to this new restaurant once. I had the brisket and thought it was great. Sides were tasty. Good value, I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is legit - staff, good, ambiance!  Very thought out concept.  Burnt end salad was delish!  Must try in Scottsdale!  Very quick and efficient! #getnaked"}
{"text":"Love their food.  The atmosphere is a little naughty since you are allowed to write a quick note on their wall about how much you love \"Naked\" but otherwise everyone is very nice, professional and go out of their way to make sure you are happy.   My favorite meat is the mouthwatering brisket on a sandwich with their yum mac and cheese. Very good prices as well for a family of four to eat."}
{"text":"Yeah, so this place is amazing!  First came here when they first opened and loved that it was empty... now its busy, the word got out! darn social media and the press!  Hopefully, no one hears about their secret menu item, then all hell would break loose. nope, I won't tell, never, its all mine!  The owner gave me a sample one day, and now I'm like crack addict for it.  How dare he give me the first bite for free knowing full well I'll start doing questionable things for another taste of that sweet ......  (ha! thought I would leak that info?! )"}
{"text":"Naked BBQ has been exposed for their low level BBQ skills and ability to make people sick.  Potato salad - this mix of uncooked potatoes, globs of mayo and not much else caused vomiting and nausea for one person dining last night.  Mac and Cheese - possibly the worst version of this dish west of the Mississippi. One customer put it best \"had better out of the box\" Watery, not cheesy, strange noodles. Carolina Cole Slaw - large pieces of poorly cut cabbage only saturated in terrible dressing Baked Beans - uncooked beans in an odd tasting sauce BBQ sauce. Inedible Cornbread - this needs a new recipe. Hard and flavorless little muffins  MEAT: The Ribs were a mess, but they looked good. They were neither baby back or st, louis and had big knuckles on them of fat making it difficult to eat. Not falling off bone and just cooked by an amateur. Chicken - nothing special, but probably the best meat. Brisket - fatty slices and not enough of them on the $15 2 meat platter.  Felt hungry and ripped off after this meal. The Valley has alot of BBQ places, but not alot of smart educated experienced BBQ people who eat the food and therefore they get better ratings than needed. Keep your clothes on and skip naked bbq."}
{"text":"I don't like BBQ all that much but the husband does so occasionally I indulge him.  Our trek to Naked BBQ turned out to be a delightful experience.  They smoked turkey for those of us not into BBQ is fantastic.  Mac n' cheese was delicious.  Perhaps the most important?  The folks there care about customer experience.  We were asked multiple times if we wanted to try things or if they could get us anything else.  These folks love what they do and it shows."}
{"text":"I stopped here for the 1st time over the weekend. I will definitely be back again (and again). I was very impressed with this place.   I will start with the food. I got a 2 meat platter with sliced brisket and ribs with baked beans and mac 'n' cheese for sides. The brisket was excellent! It was tender and perfectly done with a nice smoke ring and a great crispy bark on the outside. The ribs were well smoked and tender. At first glance the ribs looked a little smaller than I like but they gave me 4 (my wife got 3 bigger ones) and I ended up taking 2 home. The baked beans were very good and the recipe they use lets you actually taste the beans, not just the sauce. A great balance of flavors. The mac n cheese was not the best I've ever had but better than a lot of other places. The only thing I was not impressed with was the cornbread muffin. It was very small and kind of bland. I would give 5 stars with better cornbread.   Now on to the restaurant itself. The place was very clean and the staff is A+. I didn't feel rushed while looking at the menu board and deciding what to get and the staff chatted with us while we made our decisions. While we were eating someone (I assume he was the manager) stopped by our table (and several others) to make sure everything was good and see if we needed anything.    All in all this is good simple BBQ done right."}
{"text":"This small and somewhat hidden bbq joint is a gem of the north valley. I wandered in here with my wife after searching Yelp for a new spot to eat.   We walked into what I image heaven must smell like. The menu is simple and at the same time provides a lot of choices. Your meal is plated right in front of you while a crew works on prepping the newest batch coming out of the smokers. You have a choice of traditional creamy coleslaw and a Carolina version (vinegar based very tart and has a spicy tinge to it)....I recommend you at least try the Carolina. The staff was very friendly and the owner visits the tables to check on you after you have had a chance to taste everything. This tiny pocket of mouthwatering bbq goodness is a place that should be sought out if you are up this way. The portion size is fantastic. You actually get a fair amount of meat on the platters and sandwiches. We also snagged a half rack of ribs, which is the true test of any bbq place and we were not disappointed.  Enough spice and flavor you could eat them plain but you have to try one of the sauces they provide, which are kept warm for the patrons. Over all. If you leave here hungry....you did it wrong."}
{"text":"Badass BBQ! Thanks Destiny for the suggestion. Great service, small locally owned restaurant! Try both sauces! I had the brisket platter, it was awesome. The beans were bomb. Potato Salad was fanatic. Broccoli was a bit over cooked but still good."}
{"text":"I've had the Friday night prime rib and now the Saturday night beef rib.  Both Wonderful.  The turkey and brisket was juicy one time and normal the other.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Top BBQ in Phoenix. Hands down. Naked BBQ = No sauce on the meat.  Meat is well smoked and seasoned. Love taking people here because it is always consistent and good.  Would like to kick up their sides a notch with some seasoning or something, but other than that...awesome.  Try the brisket sliced or go on Tuesday for tri-tip.  (Remember they are only open until they run out of meat.)"}
{"text":"Great food, clean environment and friendly owner/staff! I'm somewhat of a food junkie and like to find places off the beaten path. I seek out non-chain restaurants and stumbled on Naked BBQ on Yelp. 28 reviews and 5 stars, I was intrigued.  The place lived up to the hype!  Upon entering the restaurant and studying the menu for the first time, we were greeted by who I presume was the owner as he made his way from behind the counter to greet us in line. He welcomed us to the establishment and explained how their food was prepared and how the menu worked. It made the seemingly unknown adventure more enjoyable, welcoming and comfortable.   The food is delicious and the BBQ sauces are a great compliment of flavor without being overwhelming. The owner made a point to make his rounds in the dining room, sharing gratitude for the patronage and playing with the kids that were dining.    It was a great lunch and refreshing to see the engaged ownership and passion for what he's doing.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was really good especially the chicken.  I picked up pork, brisket and chicken over memorial weekend and they were amazing but they ran out of the ribs.  Back we will ago.  Yum yum."}
{"text":"2nd best bbq I've had in town besides a certain Central Phoenix joint that will go unnamed here. While that may seem like damning with faint praise, Naked Bbq brings their A game. And the fact that I can actually go and get food without planning a special pilgrimage goes a long way - convenience helps! Beef and pork ribs are both great, and the brisket and pulled pork are excellent as well. Sides are just eh, but nobody goes to a BBQ joint for those anyhow, right?"}
{"text":"Excellent little BBQ spot in North Phoenix. Especially a fan of the brisket. Really creamy and delicious mac and cheese. Nothing fancy at all, but a very good choice for simple BBQ choices."}
{"text":"My friend ordered from Naked BBQ for her baby shower and the food was AMAZING! Friendly, and helpful staff as we weren't sure if we ordered enough because of how cheap it was! They even gave me a cal back to assure me that once we picked it up, if we needed more they would get whatever we needed asap. Will definitely be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Yum! I'm simple -  Good meats and sides - I'm in! Loved the brisket, Turkey, and coleslaw. The only thing I didn't love was the little cornbread muffin. It wasn't that great.  The meats were so good you could eat them without bbq sauce. I'm wondering if that's why it's called \"naked bbq\"? The owner was very nice and he gave my kids an extra side of Mac and cheese. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ!  I ordered pulled pork sandwich and side of Carolina coleslaw.  Was sort of surprised when the server offered me a sample--said it was an acquired flavor.  I happily ate the sample slaw but told them I knew what I was in for.  I really didn't though!  Their Carolina slaw is as delicious as the pulled pork.  Spicy, vinegar-y and as tasty as the pork.  Only problem with any of it was that I was too full for dessert.     Definitely welcome to our neighborhood.  I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"First thing asked was \"Where's the smoker\". Good question and it was a good answer. The beef brisket was delicious so as the pull pork. Looking forward for the next visit."}
{"text":"These guys get it .. There are maybe 3 really great BBQ joints in AZ and Naked is tied for 1st with \"lil miss\"  So for all of us in the north valley, it's the first choice. It's the BRISKET they know what it takes and take it from me (I lived in Texas most of my young life).. I don't know how, I lived in AZ without this place. Swing in you'll glad you did."}
{"text":"Blows the other BBQ joints in the area out of the water. Super consistent and always great. I wish I could make it in more!"}
{"text":"The meats were amazing, the sides are great.  All the meat is unsauced and you add you own. It's a must try for true bbq lovers"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich is very good. Wish the buns were warm. I would eat there more often since I work across the street but too hard to hold onto tray while trying to fill drink and dispense BBQ sauce. There is nowhere to set the tray down so impossible to maneuver if you have shopping bags with you. Tables are very close-there is much space outside for tables and there are none. I have walked out a few times because there was no place to sit.   I went the day before Memorial Day to take out food for 20 people and they were closed!!! Also closed on Memorial Day. Closed on 2 of their biggest selling days? Luckily the new BBQ place on Raintree WAS open both days."}
{"text":"Great bbq, just make sure you tell them to trim the fat (unless you like it).  Owner works on the food line.  Portions are a bit small but maybe that is a good thing."}
{"text":"The second best brisket in Phoenix! The best brisket is my secret because too many people already know about that place. (And it's not Bobby Q's. Yuck.) The sides are great too!!! Didn't put a drop of sauce on my brisket. It's just that good. All meats come without sauce. (Hence the name, Naked BBQ) This will be my go to place when I am near Bell Rd. And I-17!"}
{"text":"Very nice people serving great pulled pork and great brisket!  We'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are obsessed with this place. When we first discovered it, we went three days in a row. :)  I love the ribs but the brisket is also great. I always ask for the fatty pieces.   The sides are great. I recommend the Carolina coleslaw - it's tangy.   The bbq sauces are good. My girlfriend likes the spicy version. I wish they had a vinegar one!  The pickles and onions are delicious, don't skip those."}
{"text":"Mixed bag ... menu is almost too simple ... the rolls they use for the sandwich are a total mis-match with the meats served (I threw the bun away)  ... the side is good, but not great (had green beans).  On the plus side ... the pulled pork was the best I ever had ... incredible quality.  Somebody knows what they are doing with the meats ...  What do they need? ... Like Joe's BBQ in Gilbert, they need great beans (Joe's are the best in Arizona) ... and a Baked Potato option ...  You can spend $10 at Naked and leave hungry and that is not what you want from a BBQ place.  It's kind of like BBQ for Weight Watchers ...   I would go again ... but they need to improve, because the Scottsdale location they picked is brutal unless you are truly great and they are not (yet)."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place is!  I have experienced \"Austin Texas BBQ\" at Franklin BBQ and thought I had gone to brisket heaven.  Turns out that \"brisket heaven\" is a bit closer to Phoenix!  The brisket I just had at Naked BBQ was just as good as what I found in Austin!  The brisket was very tender and had a wonderful, but not over powering smokey flavor that frankly did not need any \"sauce\".  Thus their name \"naked\" BBQ . . . you don't need to drown their meat in sauce to make it taste great!  However, the two sauces they do offer (sweet or spicy) are nice in that they did not drown the fantastic underlying flavor of the brisket.  My wife had the chopped brisket sandwich and loved it. We both also had the creamy slaw and mac & cheese sides.  Both were really good as well. Staff was very friendly and responsive.  Kind of hard to find this place, but worth the effort!  Plus, it is a much shorter drive than having to head to Austin!"}
{"text":"When first visiting a restaurant we look at convenience, service and quality of food.  We generally don't patronize restaurants that require us to go through a line to order and receive food then serve our own drinks and get our utensils. Increasing the minimum wage increases self serve restaurants.  If we had been by ourselves we would have moved on but we were with another couple who wanted to try it.  The people \"on the line\" were friendly and helpful.  When paying, I was offered a tip option. No table service was offered but how do you walk away from a minimum tip. I probably would have if I had realized it would take ten minutes to get my beer served and when I received it that it would have a head taking up 1/4 of the $6 plastic cup.   The food varied in quality. The beef brisket was great and it is now available sliced. I enjoyed it.  My wife did not enjoy the dry chicken. I liked the sauce choices. The potato salad was ok according to my wife. The cole slaw was bland..,certainly unexceptional. The beans were uninteresting: spice or sweet sauce or something would have been nice. The muffins were definitely a waste of space.  Our friends had sandwiches which had minimal meat on maximum buns.  I am not an expert when it comes to barbecue but I know enough to wonder about the many 5 star reviews.  There can't be that many people in Scottsdale who have never had good barbecue."}
{"text":"A great find for this part of town.  The meats are perfectly prepared.  Try the Carolina slaw which is vinegar based.  Am looking forward to going back for more. Clean place with friendly team."}
{"text":"Mr Hartman,    The ribs were tasty and meaty.  The brisket was tender and delightful to consume.  Great service and experience!    Elvan J"}
{"text":"Simply among the best bbq in town!  The food makes up for the unassuming location.  Absolutely terrific brisket, stellar ribs, chicken, pork and sides.  Try the spicy bbq sauce if you want to add a kick-- I think they should bottle that and sell it separately.  Owner and staff are super nice.  Prices are reasonable too.  I don't write many reviews and have no affiliation with this place, just really felt compelled to post because you rarely find a place that has the right mix of great food, reasonable price, and good people."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had! I'm a BIG fan of the turkey! It's perfectly cooked- so juicy, tender, and perfectly smokey. The owner and workers are fantastic!!! They are so polite, attentive, and friendly, making the environment unlike any other- so fun and easy going! Try the turkey and mix the habanero sauce in with the BBQ sauce... And don't forget the pickled onions- #noregrets"}
{"text":"We are in town for spring break and love BBQ. After reading the reviews, we were very excited to try Naked Q. We've had some fantastic BBQ in Kentucky and while we weren't expecting that level, we were cautiously hopeful. Everyone is very friendly and the service was good. I ordered the 2 meats platter with pulled pork and brisket with two sides. I chose coleslaw and cornbread muffins. My wife picked the pulled pork sandwich and corn muffins as her side. We were charged $2 for the coleslaw which we understood to be included. All of the food was barley warm and that's being generous. The two choices of sauce were spicy or sweet and both were honestly average. The muffins were dry. The pulled pork was cold but decent. The brisket was dry. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese + some pulled pork from my sandwich= my head almost exploded. Mustard based bbq was good, the pickled cucumbers were sweet n crisp and the pulled pork basically melted like butter in my mouth."}
{"text":"Really liked the place. It's a little hidden away in the end of a strip mall, but it's a real gem of a place. Clean and open and very simple. The meat reigns in this kingdom. Beef, pork, chicken and turkey were all cooked well and tasted great. The sides are good enough, but that's not why you come here. Sweet and spicy traditional BBQ sauce, and a mustard sauce and a vinegar sauce are all tasty.    Here's a tip: mix the mustard and sweet sauce for a tasty mustard based BBQ - best on pork or chicken."}
{"text":"The lady who said the brisket is \"tough, flavorless, and dry\" is mistaken; she apparently meant to review the paper towels on the tables. The brisket is fantastic.  The pulled pork was a little too juicy for my taste. I prefer my pulled pork not to be steeped in grease, but some may disagree. Tasted OK, but not my favorite pulled pork by any stretch.  The sides were a little pedestrian.  Definitely planning on coming back and trying the other meats, and having more of the paper towels."}
{"text":"Yelp places around me while being here for work. I got the pulled pork with their side of potatoes. Service wasn't bad but nothing special either, as for the food goes I'm giving this place 3 starts just because it was an average pulled pork sandwich.   Small portions are not my cup of tea specially for a BBQ place."}
{"text":"I decided to try this because a few weeks ago I went at 4pm and they weren't open! The sign says they are open until the meat is gone! Today I had the pulled chicken and mac and cheese! Pretty tasty!! I had the unsweetened  watermelon  tea and it's really good!! Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Best brisket I have had in the valley bar none!!! Won't go anywhere else now for BBQ!!!  Addicting, and can't stop coming back!  Fast, friendly service, you can't beat!  Hats off to Oren and crew, great job guys, keep up the great BBQ!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas with a hankering for home style, we yelped our way here just in time to see them chalk off the brisket and turkey. We almost left, but the owner talked us into sticking around and it was well worth the stay. First,the workers and owner couldn't be more friendly than if they were Texans themselves. And the BBQ was pretty sweet as well. We did get to sample some burnt ends, which were great, and made us miss the brisket even more. The pulled pork was solid. The chicken (whole pieces) were excellent too. I personally would like a little spicier sausage, but it was tasty. We shared a 1/2 of ribs which were tasty but slightly less than dropping off the bone perfect.  For sides, the potato salad was great, beans looked good too (didn't try them), mac & cheese was nothing special but not bad, creamy cole  slaw was not my favorite, they offer Carolina style too.   It sounds like they do some weekly/daily specials which would be great to try out. We finished with a side of 'nanner puddin' which was surprisingly good considering how full we were.   NBBQ is in a corner spot in a suburban strip mall. Ample parking, easy access from 17, but not a lot of space inside. We enjoyed an outdoor bar table, but the weather was spring perfect. No beer here and I didn't ask if a six pack from the convenience store on the corner or if BYO would have been ok.   All in all a good meal. Our local friend who was with us will likely be back and if we're in town again, so will we."}
{"text":"A couple of Kansas City natives transplanted to Phoenix and have been looking for good bbq, well 45 mins ago we found my new favorite. Got the 2 meat platter myself with pulled pork and hot link, girlfriend got the pulled pork sammich.  The pulled pork is like eating a piece of holy swine, it is perfect in every way porky, smoky, moist, perfect. The link was no let down either it was amazing and perfectly smoked.   Now this is when I fell in love, after eating and sitting down Orin the owner comes by and let's us know the pork is best with the vinegar slaw and brings us a sample,  he was right it was. Then suggests the mustard sauce for the link, again right on the money.   We were there right at the end of the day, so of course after eating what we had ordered Orin brings both of us the days special of smoked wings...again amazing,  followed by one of the signature desserts a Lamar bar topped with maple icing and smoked bacon...so good can't even describe it properly.   Now the review should end here except Orin noticed I hadn't finished my bbq beans due to being so full, so he sends me home with a container of more for later!  Now the review ends, I love this place and I am considering living in the parking lot now."}
{"text":"My hubby liked the brisket. He felt ribs were too tough. Texas Roadhouse makes better ribs..."}
{"text":"The moment you walk into Naked (disclaimer: don't walk in naked, aka your birthday suit... the cops are not fond of this), your taste-buds start salivating... you're engulfed by the amazing smell of slow-roasted brisket, ribs, and all that heavenly home-style BBQ food.   Now for those that haven't been here yet (first off, you're missing out), it's kind of like Chipotle but for BBQ -- you choose whether you want a sandwich or a platter (pro tip: get the platter! You get more meat and two sides... more food? yes, please! Where could you possibly go wrong?!). I was super hungry so I was somewhat seeing tunnel vision and chose the brisket (and, because the 3/3 staff members that I asked recommended it, I ordered the sliced brisket rather than the pulled/shredded...  and they did not steer me wrong). For the sides, I chose the baked beans and mac 'n cheese. The baked beans are good, just a bit bland and seem to be missing something -- maybe some kind of seasoning... just can't put my finger on it -- maybe salt? Not sure. The mac 'n cheese tho... yum! It's so delish! As for the sauce, I chose spicy, 'cause I like to add a bit of spice to my life, and also my lunch.   The brisket... oh.em.gee! Literally melts in your mouth! I couldn't even hold it up on my fork; it kept falling off (that's how you know it's oh so good and cooked to perfection!) And the spicy BBQ sauce is so darn good -- perfect kick of heat, with the sweetness expected from BBQ sauce to compliment the brisket. It's like a match made in BBQ/brisket heaven. The mac 'n cheese was devoured within minutes, and the beans, eh... I may opt for coleslaw next time quite honestly.    I will absolutely be back to get Naked again (teehee) -- the food is amazing, and it's around the corner so it's extremely convenient! :) Welcome to the neighborhood, Naked BBQ... I'm sure we'll be seeing each other a lot more often."}
{"text":"My husband loves BBQ, I on the other hand, can take it or leave it.  He has gone to the original location of this place and kept telling me to come.  Finally, one day I had an appointment nearby, so finally I made it here.  I had the chicken, it was very good, tender and tasty.  I had the regular cole slaw, when mixed with the chicken it is really yummy.  My husband had the pork, it looked really good, maybe next time I will try that dish.  I also enjoyed the watermelon tea, a little different at first, but I liked it."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is the ribs! I enjoyed both locations, the staff is friendly along with the owner who ensured that you have had a good experience and enjoyable experience with the smoked meats. I recommend you ask for a side of the chunky habanero and mix it with the sauce if ya' DARE!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it to Naked BBQ after years of hearing about it. For some reason we would always remember on a Sunday and unfortunately they are closed on Sundays. We went around 6:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other couple there so we were able to step in and order right away. We got everything to-go. I have to say I was a little disappointed in all the sides. The Mac & Cheese was dry and lacking flavor, the coleslaw was very ordinary, we ordered potato salad but ended up with another order of coleslaw instead. The corn bread was very good though, soft on the inside and perfect golden brown on the outside. My favorite thing we got was the brisket! Mmmmm... I could have eaten a few pounds of that fall apart, juicy, fatty goodness. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good, I liked the toasted soft bun. There were tons of homemade sauces to chose from. Each one of them had great flavor and one had a great kick of heat, I think my favorite was the mustard, it had a nice tang. So I would like to give this place another try. We will for sure be back from some more brisket and cornbread, I'm thinking potato salad and ribs are a must next time as well."}
{"text":"We went here our last night prior to leaving Phoenix. This place is an excellent establishment. Very clean and the staff is awesome. Food was great and reasonable.  Highly recommended and we will be back every trip to the area."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE!!!! I am a huge fan of BBQ but I prefer to put my own sauce on and when I walked in I knew I was in heaven. The staff is so friendly. I always get the pulled pork,  it's so juicy and delicious. The sides are just your typical sides. I like the potato salad and the mac and cheese. The sweet sauce is perfection and the place is extremely clean. I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"On the way to Flagstaff & in an unfamiliar area to us, we relied on Yelp to help us find a good lunch place.    The Naked BBQ was fantastic!  For $8, you get a sandwich & a side.  $2 more gets you a drink.  There were also platters for a bigger appetite.  I opted for the pulled pork & mac and cheese. Tender, flavorful pork!  I added the sweet BBQ sauce & some onions.  Delicious!  The bun was sturdy enough & did not fall apart under the weight of the meat.    The BBQ sauce was very good, just the right amount of sweet.  I also got pickles which seemed to be homemade.    Nice touch!  The Mac & Cheese was creamy, hot and flavorful.  Definately not your standard hum drum side dish!  The service wad great.  5 guys behind the counter & even though it was prime lunch time & there was a steady stream of customers, we got our food quickly!  The place was spotless.  This place is right off the highway, too.  A nice plus if you are traveling!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch on Sunday and were very pleased to see they had salad options in addition to the standard sandwiches, platters and meat by the pound.   Even though some of the meats by the pound are much more expensive than others you can choose any of the proteins on top of the salad for the same $9 price for the whole salad. Given that opportunity I chose the chopped brisket ($20/lb straight). Had read other reviews that the brisket was sliced to order and made the assumption the same was true for the salad...unfortunately it was not. Some of the pieces of brisket on the salad were a little dry and others were very moist. They all had good flavor but if they could slice one 4 oz piece of brisket fresh to order, chop it and put it right on the salad, this thing would be absolutely amazing.   The other great part of the experience was that this was like Chipotle in that you walk through and they ask you what you like on your salad from the little buckets of pre-cut vegetables, egg whites etc. They had roasted corn which I got and I'm not sure if they intended to be quite as chewy and dry as it was or if it had just gotten a little bit old. It certainly added interesting texture but seemed a little too dry and not quite as fresh as it might have been.   One of the servers suggested I try the thin, white horseradish sauce for the salad. They put that in a separate cup as I had already ordered balsamic vinaigrette on the side. Being a barbecue place and because I had hot chopped beef brisket on my salad, I also served myself some of the warm spicy barbecue sauce that is available to everyone. I use a little bit of both and got a piece where the horseradish sauce had mixed with the spicy barbecue sauce. That was freaking amazing. That led me to mix the two sauces together. So if you ever go there and you like horseradish and you like barbecue sauce, try a 50/50 combo of the horseradish sauce with sweet or spicy barbecue sauce as a dressing for your salad. It would probably go well on top of a chopped brisket or pork sandwich or even just as a sauce for any of the meats as well.  We also tried a pulled pork sandwich, the baked beans and two bones of the St. Louis spareribs.  The pulled pork was very moist and flavorful and the bun it was served on was also fresh.   The St. Louis spareribs were well seasoned and very moist, but I wish they had baby back ribs because it always drives me crazy having to spit out all those little nuggets of cartilage that are on the one end of a St. Louis rib. Also since this is a fast casual place I think two dollars per St. Louis rib is a little bit too pricey. That would be $24 a rack and you pay that in a sit down restaurant. Doesn't seem appropriately priced here. $1.50 or $1.75 a rib max would be more fair.  The baked beans were not too sweet and had some chunks of meat in them.  All of the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Perhaps they were just overstaffed but it was nice to have people come out and clear your table even though the concept is fast casual and you're supposed to bus your own place.  Barbecue places generally leave us less than satisfied however Naked BBQ is very, very good and we would definitely return. The five stars here reflects the quality and flavor of the food at this location versus other barbecue spots that always seem to have four stars yet are very disappointing. Being better than all of those I had to give this one five stars."}
{"text":"I had the brisket, husband had the pulled pork. It was phenomenal. We were both so impressed and will be back as often as we are able. Only open for lunch, but you can buy the meat by the pound, so it would be easy to plan ahead.   This was a meal fit for royalty, everything was tender and fresh. Sauces were homemade, and it tasted just like bbq from the south. Priced for paupers. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like my bbq and I like it naked. Whatever dry rub these guys use is awesome. I stopped in to grab a quick bite before class and was not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Legit bbq - traditional sandwich selections, 1 meat 2 meat platters with sides and cornbread. So far I've only tried the pulled pork and sliced brisket - brisket sliced to order as it should be. All the sauces are on the side, hence Naked BBQ, but what they offer in sauces is on point. Carolina vinegar, mustard, a really nice sweet and a perfect spicy - the last two served warm.   They also sweat the small stuff - the little details, like house-made pickles and pickled white onion, really good sides and RUB to apply at the sauce station. Well-done! Portion sizes don't skimp either, solid value.   I guess this is their second location - and it's authentic and good. Definitely try it if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Visited from Cali with a basketball team and loved this place.  The place was clean and well decorated.  When we walked in the customer service was professional and friendly.  They greeted us right away and offered to put tables together for us. Awesome customer service. And we've received great customer service from Arizonians during our stay.     I order the 2 meat with brisket and ribs.   The sides were corn bread and mac and cheese.   I've tried the potato salad as well.   As we were enjoying, the gentleman handed out samples of turkey. My husband also had to chopped chicken and i stole a piece of hot link from one of the players plates when he went to get a drink.     Everything was so good!!!  The brisket was perfectly done. It was moist and flavorful.  I hate overcooked brisket.   The ribs were delicious.   They were not over seasoned or over sauced.   You can appreciate the meat.   The mac and cheese, well all the kids loved it. The pot salad was good too. Not too much dressing.   The chicken was also moist and full of flavor. My picky son loved it.  The turkey samples made me regret not ordering it. It was so good.   I should've ordered it.  My recommendation is the brisket.   I couldn't get enough of it. When my non meat eater daughter likes it, then it's good.   One thing would have liked to see is the corn bread having a crust on top.   That sweet crust would have really been nice and maybe serve with butter.   There are a lot of pics of the food already posted.   But pics don't do it justice.  Go there. Smell the aroma.  Eat the food. Leave happy.   I posted pics of the team enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Naked BBQ is probably one of the best, if not the best, BBQ place in Phoenix.   The Brisket is moist and tasty, with lots of flavor (photo). The Hot Links are spicy and have a nice kick to them. The sides that we ordered, Brisket Baked Beans, Cole Slaw and Potato Salad were all good and were made from scratch.   The owner, Oren H. buses tables and comes by to see how you enjoyed your meal. He's sincere and friendly, and cares a lot about your experience. Nice!  When he first opened Naked BBQ, the first hundred or so reviews were all Five Stars and he's pretty close to that average now. If you stop by, you'll understand why.   Expect to pay around $15 to $17 for a fantastic BBQ meal with all the fix'ens. You can order a one meat platter for $11, or a two meat platter for $15 which comes with two sides. They have sandwiches in the $8+ range, with Pop or Iced Tea available (see Menu photo).   Btw, you can also order all their meats by the Pound, for only $14 to $17 and yes, they cater. Wow   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had the smoked turkey salad today and the mac and cheese. Salad was great as I picked the ingredients. Their smoked turkey is quite good!  Hubby had the brisket sandwich also good!"}
{"text":"BBQ is always done just right. Brisket sliced is very nice, and pulled pork is always moist and tender.  Staff is super helpful. One of the north ends better BBQ spots. Sauces are tasty, and the Mac n cheese is also good."}
{"text":"There are quite a few different BBQ places in town, and I've only been to a couple, so I can't say much as to how this place compares with the others. With that said, however, I can say my brisket was melt-in-your-mouth good and their sweet BBQ sauce is probably one of the best I've had. Their sides were good as well, but I stuck with beans and corn, so there's only so much one can say about them.  To be honest, I didn't spend much time in the restaurant. I ordered to-go and they got my food prepared quick enough to the point where I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The workers we're really friendly, though, and the place looked pretty clean.   Overall, the food and service were great and the price reasonable for a quality BBQ experience. If you're in the area, try it out!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Had never been here before and they were really helpful. Threw in some pickles and onions that were great. Only wish their cornbread serving was bigger.  Has the brisket and pulled pork platter with two sides. Mac and Cheese very good. Didn't see need a knife to cut the brisket. Definitely will be going back  Our second visit. We were extremely disappointed. Meats were cold and dry. Last time could cut the brisket with just a fork. This time needed a chainsaw. Cornbread dried out and cold.  Evidently no quality control here.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Had the pork sandwich with homemade pickles.  Beans and mac and cheese were amazing as well. Staff was very helpful and nice.  Was in from Los Angeles for vacation and would love to come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"It's not bad. However, I like BBQ a lot, so I have gone to a few places. This is really the only place like it in it's area so for that is it ok. I was really looking forward to the mac and cheese after reading a review and was really disappointed. The sausage was not bad but I did expect a little more seasoning in it or a smoker taste. I am not a sauce person, because I like the Smokey hickory taste, not the sweet, and they have very sweet sauces and rubs. The Brisket was very fatty to the point even the person that had lunch with me didn't like it, even though they like a good marbling. I personally hate fatty meat, so I didn't even try it. The guy cutting did do a leaner/trimmed pieces of meat for a regular that was ahead of us but did not even speak to us when he was doing our cut. The pulled pork was dry and like the sausage could used more flavoring. I am not sure, but I think they use an electric smoker which could be why the meat didn't have that think smoked flavor I am use to with good BBQ.  Overall if you are crazing BBQ at lunch and want a place that doesn't really have a wait, try this place out. However, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I remember when I saw this place hit my email.  I had been wanting to check it out.  To be honest I had kept pushing it off and off.  Really wanting to come here.  Everyone got a different plate, I went for the single rib plate.  I do have one gripe, I was the only one with a cold plate.  Like c'mon, ribs are supposed to be hot.  But I tell you what, I'd eat these ribs cold out of the fridge.  Perfect.  The brisket and pulled pork, yum.  Also, if you want desert, get the mini pies, the peach was amazing."}
{"text":"Good BBQ is hard to find in Phoenix (from what I've seen) however I was pleasantly surprised that I found this place as the BBQ was good southern-style.  Friendly staff, just wish they had more options for sides and longer hours.  Good place!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Simple options that taste amazing. We even had a BBQ connoisseur in our group from Texas and she said it's some of the best she has had! Oh and we got a free bacon maple bar!"}
{"text":"Stopped by at about 7:30 on a Saturday night for a late dinner after reading other reviews on yelp. I must say I was not disappointed. I ordered the two meat platter. I got sliced brisket, I wanted the hot links but they were out so I got the pulled pork. I added two pork rib bones to the order and I wanted to try the maple bacon doughnut but the lady in front of me got the last one. I had my meal there and tried all the BBQ saues, I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce but I had to try them. The mustard sauce was my favorite with the hot in a close second and the vinegar sauce bringing up the rear. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1 meat with 2 sides. Got the brisket, which was nice. Plenty of it in the serving, although a bit dry. The barbeque sauce I selected they called \"spicey\" but it really wasn't. We like our food hot in Arizona, and this had no heat, in my opinion.  The beans I selected were good, but the potato salad was the WORST I've ever eaten. The potatoes were crunchy like they were raw and there was no flavor.  For the money, I don't think I'll eat here again. Not recommended if you're looking for good bbq. Sorry Naked bbq, but that's my opinion."}
{"text":"Pretty good pulled pork sandwich. One of the main ways I judge a BBQ joint is based on portion size. For $8, I feel like the meet should be falling off the bun - that's not the case here. Besides the portion size, the rest of the expirence was pretty good overall. Great potatoe salad!"}
{"text":"I'm not a BBQ fan, but the hubs is so we stopped in. Even I was impressed! I had a brisket sandwich and it was delicious. He had the pork which he also loved, but he favored my brisket. One of the things I appreciated the most was that it wasn't heavily smoked. (I don't care for that especially.) The sides were tasty as well, Mac n cheese and potato salad, and the homemade pickles also impressed! This is a little hole in the wall place with counter service and well worth a trip! The employees were friendly as well and someone even came to the table to make sure we were satisfied. Good value for the money!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've found in AZ.  Nice and moist with good flavor before you even add sauce. About the only downside if there was one, would be the spicy sauce isn't very spicy. Definitely will be back again"}
{"text":"It's all delicious. Best brisket I've had and the pulled pork is solid. They keep the BBQ warm and ready so you can pour it on at your convenience. And they have good sweet tea to wash it all down.   And try the peach cobbler. I was full, but had no problem scarfing it down it was so good. I can't wait to go back and try the ribs. My friend got them and loved them, and they looked amazing"}
{"text":"Barbecue without sauce is like doctors without borders, men without hats, and a day without sunshine - forehead-slapping concepts that so align with the human condition as to defy expectations on why they wouldn't exist. But it does exist in north Phoenix in where else but a strip mall. It's called naked for a reason since the sauce isn't smothering the meat like in most smokehouses. No, there's innate trust in the quality and flavor of the meat presented here, whether it's pulled chicken, sliced turkey, hot links, or the two that I selected, Pulled Pork and Chopped Brisket (photo: http://bit.ly/2eOADSp). For $14, you get a Platter, or more accurately, a tray of two meats, two sides and a cornbread muffin (photo: http://bit.ly/2eOxhix).  My choices for the sides were Mac & Cheese, the melty kind that isn't baked the old-fashioned way, and the Veg of the Day, which were Grilled Broccoli Florets (photo: http://bit.ly/2duVIM1). Both were delicious but not more than the plentiful portions of brisket and pork which benefited from splooges of barbecue sauce and mustard. But it was on my terms. My one disappointment was just the size of the cornbread muffin which was uncharacteristically mini-size, so I stocked up on the sliced pickles as compensation. By the time I get to Phoenix next time, she may not be rising, but I'll be eating some 'cue naked. Not me...the meat. That would be so wrong...like a day without sunshine.  FOOD - 4 stars...hefty portions of naked 'cue with tasty sides AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a clean, well-kept spot SERVICE - 3 stars...friendly enough though they kept moving us along TOTAL - 4 stars...solid go-to for those in this part of Phoenix"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, chopped or sliced. The sauces were very good. We visited from CA service and food were top notch. We ended up up going twice in the short time we stayed!"}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork and beef brisket! Staff is extremely nice and helpful. Will be back to try something else :)"}
{"text":"Good BBQ meats and sausages, great smoke flavor authentic BBQ sides.  This place tucked back on Bell road and I17 on east side if freeway by Lamar's Doughnuts.  Worth the stop great for lunch and a quick stop anytime of the day."}
{"text":"I am so happy I saw this place on Yelp! I'm visiting from California and we decided to go here since it was so close and I'm so glad we did. We were served with the most respect I've ever had at a restaurant! Very friendly staff and actually cared about my gluten allergy and went to the most trouble to accommodate me without me even asking! Amazing food and service. MUST GO."}
{"text":"Craving BBQ one morning my wife and I rolled into this place just a little after they opened.  Wow!  Place was packed and smelling good, usually  a good sign.  I ordered the two meat meal; sliced brisket, ribs and the vegetable of the day.  My wife had a pulled pork sandwich.        The meats were excellent.  Brisket was falling apart with a terrific, flavorful bark. I gotta say the dry rub definitely stood out for me, literally could eat the meal dry if I hadnt been wanting to taste the sauces.  The ribs were cooked perfectly, and the meat easily came off the bone with no resistance.  The vegetable was seasoned great and the corn muffin was a pleasent surprise.      As far as service, the place is quick and high energy.  I'd suggest you figure out what you want before going up to order as this place starts busy and stays busy till the meat runs out.  Drinks and BBQ sauce are self-serve and the BBQ sauce is kept nice and warm as well using a pretty nifty condement dispenser.        Compared to the BBQ I've had in AZ, this place is light years ahead of most of the competition in terms of quality and consistency.  You really do not find good BBQ often in Arizona, so if you're in the area, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"I noticed their gigantic billboard a month ago and decided with some friends to give it a try. I asked to sample some of their meats and was given the pulled chicken, pulled pork, chopped brisket and smoked turkey. The first 3 meats were pretty good, but I was blown away by their smoked turkey. Normally turkey is the last thing I would think to get at a BBQ place, but their turkey was really flavorful and EXTREMELY juicy.  After the sampling, I proceeded in ordering the 2 meat platter with sliced brisket and turkey. Each platter comes with a corn bread muffin and your choice of two sides. I ordered the mac & cheese and creamy coleslaw. The chopped brisket I got as a sample was actually juicer than the sliced brisket I got in my platter, but it was still yummy. Although their spicy BBQ sauce did taste GOOD,  the meat can stand up on its own.  Overall I'm excited that there is yet another restaurant in North Phoenix that is a keeper. Next time I want to try the ribs , hot links and if there's room the maple bacon doughnut."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is great. We received a warm,  friendly welcome upon entering. It was our first time and the menu was explained to us. We were offered samples of the food to try before purchasing. My husband said his brisket was the best he has eaten in his 10 years living here. My pulled pork was tender, juicy and flavorful. The ranch beans had three different beans, meat and a little jalapeno to give it a kick. We could choose vinegar or mayonnaise based slaw. I had the mayonnaise and it was delicious. Good sweet tea also. The owner came by our table to see if we were pleased. We were. Small, fun dining area. Guests wrote funny notes on the wall about their visit. Perfect, casual dining experience. We will return. It is in a small strip mall behind a donut shop so not visible from the road. A sign is near the road though. Put it in your GPS and go get Naked!!!! (6/19/2018)... We have returned many times and the food continues to WOW us. We have also purchase several bottles of the sweet BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST BBQ ever in my life!! All homemade food! Absolutely delicious!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"First time here with my lovely wife  for lunch. Was greeted by the staff with a smile and we both ordered the chopped brisket sandwiches with macaroni and cheese.  OMG the sandwiches were fantastic! Finished our meal and was asked by the owner how everything was. Super nice and found out he has a second location over on Shea and the 101 that I will visit as well. Thanks and definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing BBQ here in Phoenix. From the food to the hospitality, everything is top notch. Well traveled BBQ lover and everything on the menu is can't miss. Brisket and the smoked turkey is ridiculous. Oh and if you have room...Definitely get the donut."}
{"text":"As good as Little Miss, if not better. What potentially makes it better you ask. Not only do they make their own BBQ sauce that's truly amazing, but it's still a bit of a hidden gem without a crazy line. I work five minutes from Little Miss... In the time it takes my boss to get his food from there, I can drive to Naked, eat and be back!! Have to say, might be the best BBQ in AZ!"}
{"text":"So after 4 hours of hot dog Vending at a park event where else would I go to eat? Naked BBQ of course. I was cruising down the 101 thinking I was really hungry but I wasn't sure for what and then I remembered Naked BBQ it's off Shea. I cut three lanes over with my trailer and tow got off at Shea and got into the parking lot. Is in storage the back of the store I could just see, yes, they were open. My heart filled with such Glee and happiness I could barely contain myself. I walked in and 3 other folks walking out we're asking me why aren't you eating your own hot dogs? I replied I do have the best hot dogs in the state but this barbecue is so off the hook good I seek it out whenever I can. So folks, thank you so much for another fantastic dinner that made me oh so happy. I will come here whenever I am nearby and you are open."}
{"text":"Smokey, but not too smokey. Tender, moist, delicious. Had the Brisket, Spicy sausage a couple of ribs, Mac n Cheese and Cole Slaw. All were good. If you're looking for good BBQ, stop in this place is the real deal.  PS - Had the Scottsdale Blond beer on tap. Great company for the BBQ."}
{"text":"Tried this place because my friends said it was good.  Chopped brisket is very tasty. Met the owner, liked him. Will go back!  From KC and grew up on that BBQ, this place rates very high in same flavor. Love the fact I can sauce my own  meat. Smoked ribs are huge. Good portions, flavorful sides."}
{"text":"Today for lunch, my colleague and I decided to go to Naked Q. My colleague said they had excellent brisket so I decided to give it a try. We got there around 1:30pm. There were a few occupied tables. You order at the register and by the time you pay, your food is ready. We both ordered the 2 meat platter. I chose the pulled chicken and the sliced brisket as my two meats. I also decided to try the Mac & cheese (even though I don't eat cheese) & the coleslaw as the two sides. The meal also comes with a muffin (corn bread) and you can have free pickles. Can't remember but I believe I paid either $15 or $16 for this meal. My colleague ordered the pulled pork and sliced brisket and ordered the Mac & cheese and beans as her sides. There are quite a few sauces to choose from. I chose the hot BBQ for the brisket and the mustard sauce for the chicken. The price is pretty high however, the meal is big & even though it didn't look like much at the beginning, I was stuffed by the end of it.   The brisket was pretty good. It was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too spicy, it gave the meat a great flavor. The chicken, honestly, I didn't like it. I ate a bite of it before adding the mustard sauce and it wasn't very good. I added the sauce and it was better but still meh. I actually had maybe a couple of bites or so and then decided to just not eat it. The coleslaw was ok, Mac & cheese was good. The corn bread was dry but the flavor was there. My colleague didn't care for the beans but everything else she had was pretty good.   I may be back here again but just for the brisket."}
{"text":"It's ok, sides weren't good at all and the meat wasn't very warm. It was pretty salty for me but some people like that. I've had bbq all over and to me this place is a c+."}
{"text":"I could not miss the giant billboard on Bell Road, \"Eat Naked\" BBQ. Great experience from excellent food, nice atmosphere, friendly service, to a very passionate owner. You get the feeling you are experiencing a brand new concept and business that will someday make it big. What was it like walking into the first McDonald's in 1940?  Great concept to have the \"naked\" BBQ meat (the meat without sauce) and you select your own sauce from the five or so at the condiment bar. You can also create your own by mixing the sauces. I tried them all, I tried the different meats too. Everything was excellent. I would recommend the pork, beef, ribs, or links. The only hard part here is deciding what to order, but I don't think you can go wrong.   When I saw the sign out front \"open at 11am, close when the meat is gone.\" I thought it was just for fun. Not true. They ran out of some of the meat about 1:30pm on the second day I was there. They started to close. Get there early."}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq in town. Friendly service and good food is a tough combination to beat."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, price is reasonable, decor is utilitarian chic, service is wonderful. Wish it could be open more hours, but I completely understand: it's better to have quality than quantity.   Ordered the two meat platter with ribs and brisket, regular creamy coleslaw, green beans (vegie of the day) and a little corn muffin. Love that everything is nicely arranged on a tray.   Portion size was perfect. One tray satisfactorily fed two people who weren't that hungry, but needed lunch. If you are hungry, get your own platter. You won't regret it.   The meat was a masterpiece of the grill. The ribs were tender, thick, and infused with a smoky flavor. I topped it with the spicy BBQ sauce for an even greater flavor punch, but I honestly think you could eat it 'naked.' The brisket was marbled, tender and again very smoky.   The sides were okay. The mini corn muffin was delicious, but so tiny. The staff at the counter let me try the Carolina coleslaw when I was trying to decide which one to get. I didn't really like the vinegary tang, so I got the creamy coleslaw, which was ok.   I loved the decor- walls covered in distressed wood, paper towels conveniently on each table, the writing on the walls. It was a great setting for a casual lunch.   The owner came by and checked on us, which was great.   Deducted one star because I really wish it was open more hours and on Sunday. Call ahead if going late in the day to make sure they are still open."}
{"text":"Terrific BBQ. Surprisingly, our neighborhood was lacking good BBQ so really happy they've opened.  You can tell everything's made on site including the sides.  Our family had brisket, chicken and pork and everyone was very happy. Prices are really reasonable for the portions.  Owners were on site and really nice. You can tell they take great pride in serving freshly made authentic food.  PS try the beans as your side, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick early lunch.  Very clean store front location with minimal decor in a busy part of North Scottsdale.  Fast food type walk up system.  Ordered a brisket sandwich and mac & cheese.  Large measured portion of chopped brisket.  Would prefer a more distinct smoke flavor but still quite tasty.  Two BBQ sauces served on the side.  The mild sweet sauce was a nice compliment to the brisket.  Mac & Cheese serving was ample but just average taste. Come early as this is a popular spot for lunch as it filled up quickly."}
{"text":"Very delicious. The brisket here is unreal, they really nailed it. All of the food is outstanding, I want to eat the whole menu. The staff is very friendly and professional. The owner Orin is very easy to talk to, he came right out to our table to welcome us. I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"When you see 99 reviews with that kind of star rating you figure this place would be off the chain.  When k first walked in it smelled a little funny. I ordered a two item meat combo with brisket and spicy sausage. Brisket was very moist but full of a lot of fat pieces. Need to do some trimming. The sausage was ok not spicy at all and I didn't like that they cut it up into little pieces so when I went to eat they were kind of dried up. They had two kinds of BBQ sauce. One sweet one spicy. When I started to eat I could not tell the difference.  The sweet tea was good. The little piece of cornbread was not so good. I also got a Mac and cheese. When you go to a BBQ Mac and cheese needs to be stepped up. This tasted like store bought brand."}
{"text":"I glad that I decided to give Naked BBQ another try because they improved a lot since my last visit. I did want to try the brisket because that is how I usually judge BBQ but they were out of brisket so I tried the turkey. THE TURKEY WAS REALLY AWSOME! It's really hard to flavor a turkey breast just right and keep it moist. The turkey had many flavors going on with it and was smoked just right. It was delicious!  Just like last last time my husband really enjoyed the pulled pork he said it was very good.  I thought the pickles and corn muffin were really tasty. (didn't need the hot bbq sauce but it was also very tasty)  The coleslaw was very improved. It was fresh tasting, a little sweet and pretty drip free.  The fresh vegetable was mushy but it was nice that a healthy choice was offered.  The owner checked on everyone in the restaurant and made sure everyone was happy.  This is one of the best BBQs on this side of town!"}
{"text":"The good was amazing!!!... I was a pig and ordered two platters. The first one with brisket and spicy link, and the other I got it with pulled pork and ribs. Everything was delicious. The brisket had a nice bark with smokiness. The links were spicy enough... meaning you can still taste the flavor of the sausage. The pulled pork... OMFG!!!! juicy, tender awesome bark... and the ribs amazing as well... can't type anymore... food coma!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really into this Q!  I prefer BobbyQ's a whole lot better.  FYI - I spent over 1 year in KC on business expenses.  Needless to say I have eaten a lot of BBQ - good and bad!  I make my own dry rubs, and smoke meat myself.  I thought the sauces were nothing special, and the ribs weren't all the good.  I've been to several BBQ cook offs, even met and spoke with Caroline Wells at one of the events.  I probably own 20 + BBQ books, the latest from the Texas legend, Aaron Franklin.  So, I'm not new to Q!  I do really like Lamar's donuts and the Vietnamese restaurant Bahn Mi which are near this joint.  Also, there is Carambas which is decent fast food Mexican in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was excellent - juicy, slight marinade tang, some fat - five stars.  Sliced brisket was pretty dry and had over-salted bark exterior - three stars.  Sandwich-of-the-day (Tuesday) was smoked tri-tip - which was perfectly cooked medium rare but did not have any smokiness in the meat - 3 stars.  Veg-of-the-day was outstanding:  garlicky green beans, 5 stars.  Baked beans were middle of the road (3 stars).  Creamy cole slaw was bland and boring (2.5 stars).  Pickled onions and pickle slices tasted fresh and had great snap (4.5 stars).  Crowded at lunchtime.  $10 gets you the Sandwich-of-the-day plus a side and a bottomless drink.  A two-meat platter with two sides and a mini corn muffin will set you back $14.  Reasonable prices given the quality and quantity.  I think this place is a step up from Pork on a Fork.  Since this was our maiden visit - will hope the poor showing on the brisket was an anomaly...  They certainly have a solid lunch following.  Convenient to Turf Paradise, too!"}
{"text":"This isn't  BBQ.  Got a half rack of ribs and they fall off the bone. No real bbq would have that happen, you should see your \"bite marks\" and these are equivalent to basically boiling the ribs. Flavor is fair nothing special. If these were entered into a competition, prob end up towards last place. They say \"award winning BBQ\" on sign. Huh?? Award for \"participation\"?? Give me a break.  Carolina slaw also fair at best. Nice service is why they get 3 stars. But I wont come back, I'm a purist.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"Naked BBQ hosted me and my friends for a buddy's 40th birthday BBQ crawl and it was fantastic.  The favorite meats were the hotlinks and the pulled pork, and the cool thing is they have an extensive selection of sauces you can put on the meats, including hard to find mustard sauce and Carolina vinegar-based sauce.     The owners did a fantastic job of accommodating the specific needs of our group, which was to have a small sampling plate - just enough to taste a variety of things.  See pic for the idea - it was perfect.  Great service, great food.  Highly recommended for get-it-to go or dine-in, easy location to access."}
{"text":"Naked BBQ sticks out like a sore thumb on this side of town full of chain restaurants. The decor inside is clean and modern. The food has a touch of sophistication that you would find in a restaurant located in Downtown Phoenix. I ordered a hot link sandwich with macaroni and beans. The bread looks gourmet and holds up well with the meat and sauce. I feel like my bbq sandwiches always fall apart but that was not the case here. The homemade pickles rocked my world! We were also given some brisket to try out which was very good as well. My sister said it was the best she's ever had! We are in desperate need of more restaurants like this in North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This BBQ is seriously delicious! You can tell a lot of work goes into making sure you taste the quality of the meat. The BBQ dressing is left up to the customer on how much he/she wants and that's what I love most. I can't wait to go back when I visit AZ again or if it makes its way out to Cali"}
{"text":"The meat is so tender and the sides are amazing. I really don't like brisket but having a taste of my husbands meal was otherworldly. The mac and cheese is a must! Always busy and now we know why. Would have taken pictures but devoured the food too fast!!"}
{"text":"Get here early. The flavors in the good are way above average. The sauces are great. Nice molasses, honey, and brown sugar flavors. The meat is served with no sauce; hence the name. Most places have come slaw that is regular coleslaw with a little vinegar, but They have Carolina slaw as well as regular slaw, both are diffrennt and good. Give this a try, you won't regret it.."}
{"text":"Naked bbq is exactly what kind of restaurants Phoenix (especially North Phoenix) needs! The food was out of this world yummy. Their daily special, which is usually a sandwich I believe is something you'll want to try. Fresh, great smokey flavor and great combinations of meats. My favorite so far is the brisket! YUM!!! also be sure to try their sweet tea and watermelon tea  Get here early as possible, when the meat runs out they close up shop!   It's behind Lamar's donuts off the I-17 & Bell, North side of the street."}
{"text":"This is by far the best barbecue in Arizona! The customer service was amazing, they went above and beyond. Today I was sampling things for my halloween party and they were so accommodating. Each employee was helpful with my many questions and the food was delicious! My favorite things were the chopped brisket, pork and mac and cheese. I loved all of their sauces too! (I'm a sauce gal) The owner (Oren) has been so helpful with my catering questions via email and his response time has been fast. 10 out of 10 for sure!!!"}
{"text":"After typing in BBQ more places than I could count came up.  I worked my way down the list until I got to Naked BBQ.  Seeing that all the reviews were 4 and 5 stars I had to try it out with the family.  The food took center stage as I anxiously sought to discern if all the high reviews were warranted.  They were!!  Everything tasted fresh and homemade, because it is.  When the man in charge found out it was our first time he brought out samples of everything we didn't order, brisket and sausage being the most notable.  The kids had some ribs and two of them shared the prime rib, special for that night.  Not only did they eat every bite of their food but my daughter was gnawing on her ribs trying to get every drop of sauce.  I really liked how the meats are smoked \"naked\" and you can season them any way you choose, it really takes the guesswork out of the process.  If you like to eat at a place knowing that the first concern is always quality do yourself a favor and give it a try.  But keep in mind that while they're open for lunch everyday, dinner is only Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"They are correct, you don't need any sauces to enjoy the moist flavor that that they are able to coax out of their various meats.  If you need a little more they have a solid selection of sauces that can add a little sweetness or kick to your meal.  Little Miss BBQ will likely always wear the crown in Phoenix but this is an excellent next option."}
{"text":"Good barbecue. Clean restaurant. Wish they had a changing table in the restrooms for babies"}
{"text":"I normally don't right a review until I actually eat the food . But I have to start off by saying soon as I walk into this place they have the most wonderful staff working there . Now I did get a sample of there beef brisket and it was so delicious :) ..... So I ordered the pork and beans , sausage links and watermelon ice tea to go . All was pretty good . I will be returning soon for some of that beef brisket :)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ hands down   Today was my first visit to Naked BBQ but it won't be my last.  Naked BBQ has the best BBQ hands down.  The sandwich meat choices include pulled pork, beef brisket, pulled chicken, tri-tip, sliced turkey, and hot links.  In addtion, to thier delicious meat selection Naked BBQ has a variety of side dishes and desserts. Everything from coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni & cheese, baked beans,  roasted vegetables, cornbread,  peach cobbler, and bacon Maple donuts.     What I enjoyed most about Naked BBQ is they serve thier entrée's  NAKED (without sauce).  So you can dress your entree just the way you like it.  I went for the sweet sauce and it was absolutely delicious.   The staff at Naked BBQ is second to none.  Service is fast and friendly.  Food I'd delicious and reasonably priced.  It doesn't get any better.  If you enjoy good BBQ, stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Brisket is very good. Possibly best I've ever had. However, the sides such as the beans or corn bread aren't worth your time. Preferably, do not order a platter but just a sandwich."}
{"text":"We are from North Carolina and love vinegar sauce, and here in Arizona it is hard to find a place that has a good one, but this place hit it on the nose! It is one of our favorite restaurants to go to now! Plus, the owners are wonderful! Great place! Kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday for the first time. We loved the turkey, the brisket, the beans and the macaroni and cheese. So happy to have this new joint in our neighborhood! We will be back! And soon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it! The pulled pork in my sandwich was so tender  I'm sure my baby loved it too cause I could feel him doing flips in my belly lol. Their take on pickles is awesome! Plus the owner is super friendly.. I will definitely be making this one of my regular spots :)"}
{"text":"Love love love naked bbq! I've tried the brisket, chicken, pulled pork, hot links, and ribs. It's all so tender, no sauce needed but if you like, there's 2 choices as well as mustard and a dry rub.  It's very casual inside, no frills or fuss here. Oren the owner really cares about his customers, he makes sure to ask for feedback and loves his regulars. There's a chalkboard sign on the wall with the name of the first customer written each day.   Unsweetened watermelon iced tea really hits the spot too. Not my thing really, but one Saturday I went in late and Oren insisted on a maple bacon donut on the house. It was amazing! Not overly sweet and heavy, and the bacon was perfect.  It's definitely worth the drive to stop in for lunch!"}
{"text":"Unassuming in a corner of a strip mall, and awesome. Here's a rundown of my lunch. The brisket was wonderful, chopped with bits of black charred crust in each bite. The pork was lean and naked, perfect. The sides were baked beans and broccoli with garlic, both were really good and plentiful.  I had a late breakfast but being in the area I had to stop. I wonder what I would have thought of this food if I was really hungry. Best barbecue I've had in Arizona and all I heard from the staff was, thank you for coming."}
{"text":"I do not travel out west and not stop here. The meats are heaven.( brisket and spicy sausage my favorite) The Mac and cheese and cornbread are a must. Absolutely love this place.  Only down side to getting naked. Is they close at 4. Also don't forget your watermelon tea."}
{"text":"These guys smoke their brisket all night, it's fantastic. Simple sides like mac n cheese, green beans, beans, choices for sauce. Great folks, great  food, great service. Brisket goes fast so get there early"}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ - complete hidden gem ... so close to me and i had no idea... The guys working the counter were kind and helpful... The food was fantastic and what i have come to love from the southern states... Great Find :-) cannot wait to go back again"}
{"text":"I found it to be okay.  I had really high expectations...the meat was a bit salty to me, but overall not too bad.  The employees were very nice.  While dining in, I noticed there were a lot of large flies flying around.  That, I did find annoying.  Perhaps an insect light trap could help!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow I took my 8 year old here right before closing today I've been dying to try this place out the only reason I haven't is cuz they close at 4 o'clock I've been on a BBQ binge lately so I have been taking my 8 year old son around the valley and trying all the BBQ places around. This place seals the deal it's amazing not sure if it was the owner of the manager +1 worker made us feel so comfortable and the food is outstanding the smoke and the taste and the texture is to die for the only issue I have is the hours but phenominal!!! My sons favorite place we will be repeat customers"}
{"text":"My brother in law & I drove up at 4:10 pm only to see Orin the owner locking up! Seems they close early on Mondays. WHAT?  I told him we had driven 14 miles from Surprise cause Yelp had featured this place a few days ago as one of the best pork joints in Phoenix.   He reopened & let us in serving tender ribs & brisket TOTALLY naked! Now we understood the name cause the meat served without sauce so the real smoke flavor is scrumptious.   Thankfully I didn't have to watch my old, bald brother in law eating while sitting naked. LOL   We paid $40 for a full rack of ribs, pound of brisket, beans, cold slaw & soft drinks. Was plenty so now I'm home finishing off the leftovers. The BIL paid the bill so was a sweet day for me!  So, check the place out- just don't show up on a Monday after 4 pm. Maybe you won't find Orin in a charitable mood."}
{"text":"I grew up on Texas BBQ so I am always disappointed when I have BBQ anywhere else.  Well disappointment no more when I found this place, I love the ribs here.  Very good.  Had them 3 times now.  Each time was great!  The pulled pork and chopped beef brisket were okay.  Weren't my favorites here.  The sides were okay, nothing special.  The hot links were were my second favorite choice here.  The owner is always nice and very friendly.  Nice place for lunch.  Best BBQ ribs in Phoenix, depending on the day and time. :)  4-stars because it is not consistent."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ joints I have ever been to. I haven't tried anything on the menu that wasn't fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time and wow!! This place is great. Think we found our new go to for bbq"}
{"text":"This place was great! So fresh & tasty! We will definitely be back!! Loved the mac & cheese and the pulled chicken. I do wish for the sandwich they would grill the roll or have it warm instead of cold. Overall great place though!!"}
{"text":"I'm from FL visiting my dad, and came over to get \"Naked\" is was great.  The pulled pork was awesome.."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was superb.  Him: 2 meat platter-ribs, brisket, veg, potato salad  Me: 2 meat platter-brisket, hot links, mac n chz, creamy slaw  Loved everything, except the slaw was a little bland but the owner (?) quickly took notice and replaced it.   Definitely will be back. Around 2 next time cause lunch hour is PACKED!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what I wanted for lunch and came across this gem while trying to leave the parking lot close to TJ Max on 90th in Scottsdale.  First, the service was outstanding!  You walk up and order from the counter.  I ordered the pulled chicken and some sides but I really wanted the brisket.  They gave me a sample of the brisket.  It was sooooo good!  I will definitely get that next time!  The spicy sauce is so delicious.  I mixed the sweet and the spicy onto my chicken when I got home.  Yum!  If you are in the area, stop by! It's next to the Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 star because the staff was great, one of the best. Friendly service and the place looked the part. Unfortunately the food was average. I am from Texas and love my BBQ and expected more by reading the reviews. The brisket was good but my mac and cheese was dry and hard and for the beans, I have had better from Bush beans in the can. There are a few choices of BBQ in North Scottsdale so I was hoping to find a place I can go regularly but I don't see myself coming back unless I really craved BBQ close by. Thumbs UP to the staff a decor but thumbs DOWN on the food. Sorry guys, maybe I might try back another time to see if the food improves."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Smallish restaurant in a shopping complex, with a order your food at the counter set-up. Has about 14 tables. Decorated in some wood paneling with blues music playing adds to the BBQ motif. Patrons from all ages and backgrounds.  Food: Menu includes several sandwich and platter options (pulled pork, pulled chicken, brisket etc). I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. Very tender and full of genuine flavor. No need to add BBQ sauce although they have several sauces available. The sides are great as well. I went with the corn bread which was great. Also nice to see several sweet tea options.  Service/price: Pretty simple order at counter setup allows for a quick in and out experience. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Sandwiches are eight dollars which I thought was fair for the portion sizes.  Overall: Great BBQ option if you're in the mood for a quick in and out experience and don't need the traditional dine in experience."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious BBQ, all around a good  place for lunch.. The brisket was very tender and moist, turkey was probably best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Naked BBQ has renewed my faith in the Scottsdale food scene,  I have not had such delicious BBQ anywhere in the Southwest.  Fans of Toms Thumb BBQ, which is okay, need to try this for REAL BBQ!!!  The prices on all of the items are reasonable, but especially the deserts.  Two dollars for peach cobbler and banana pudding can you say hell yeah!   I had a two meat platter with smoked turkey and pulled pork.  If you haven't tried the smoked turkey yet with sweet sauce, you haven't truly lived.  My wife and I were fortunate enough to go early on Friday, which is $20 prime rib.  I am not a steak eater by any means, but the perfectly pink 20 oz prime rib nearly converted me.  I honestly thought the slab of prime rib was a double slice on accident.  The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was because they forgot my desert, but it was really busy and I called and they will make it right on my next order."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it. This place is great. Chopped brisket is my favorite but I haven't had anything I didn't like. Mac n cheese is good to go. Best BBQ around"}
{"text":"Really great food, quick and friendly service. I've never left hungry!"}
{"text":"This is some damn good BBQ. Southern style. Pulled pork sandwich was flavorful and had large chunks of pork that was juicy and tender. Spicy and sweet bbq sauce station to choose from to add flavor. Spicy was light and tangy with a bit of sweet. Not spicy enough for me. Carolina Cole slaw was vinegar based and had some spice to it as well. Not your traditional slaw but was delish.  My only negative is the should invest in a bun warmer. You get piping hot meat and warm bbq sauce but the damn bun is COLD. Guys if you're reading this......get a bun warmer. I mean your name is Naked BBQ after all.  If your naked your buns are gonna be cold...just saying.  I will come back and asked for my buns to warmed.   Now get naked and go have some BBQ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ places in the valley. Very low key hidden behind a donut shop. The owner takes pride in his food and facility. It's always a joy to eat here. Only open for lunch for now but he said dinner on the weekends is coming soon."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place! We ordered the Brisket and Hot Links. The meat was perfectly cooked. The sides had a great flavor as well. The corn bread had jalapeños ... great combination. I would definitely return and cater for events."}
{"text":"Debi and I have been a patron of the first Naked BBQ near I-17 and W. Bell Road, almost since it opened.  We ate lunch at Orin's second unit here in north Scottsdale, last Thursday.  They did NOT disappoint at their new location!!!  They have some of THE best BBQ around.  This area really needed this. This location even has beer & wine!!!   Debi & I wish Orin nothing but great success going forward.  Being in the restaurant business ourselves, we appreciate someone striving for a great product and great customer service.  They excel in both!!!  We will need to bring in our Fast Glass Corvette Club members to this unit now....   :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing ribs and sauces! Super friendly owners! We will be flying down from Napa, California just to eat here!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews but we ordered this for lunch on afternoon. The meat left a bad taste in my mouth and was very mushy and the cole slaw tasted very old and like it was left out all day. The only good part was the mac and cheese, I am very particular when it comes to my favorite food of all time and they did a great job on the mac and cheese. I really wanted to like this pace but wasn't impressed at all. Maybe in the future I will try it again and be able to up my rating."}
{"text":"This place satisfies any craving for BBQ in a clean rustic minimalist setting.  The ribs were good but the brisket was awesome!  There never seemed to be enough mac n cheese, my kids gobbled each little cup of mac n cheese up.  What impressed me about the place was the cleanliness--you usually don't think of BBQ places being very clean and tidy--with all the meat and sauces cooking--but this one was very clean!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the pulled pork!! It was moist and had lots of flavor. The sides we got...cornbread and slaw were also very good. And to top it off....watermelon iced tea and a chocolate chip cookie!!!!! Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is delicious, fast, and a great value!  Try the ribs they're amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wow. What happened here? Ordered the pulled pork and it was so dry with no real taste. The bun was cold too. What does it take to give a warm bun for a sandwich. Of course,there was no owner or manager around. Just teenage help that looked like they just got released from Tent City.  Come on Man, watch your business or you won't have one."}
{"text":"8 months ago I reviewed NBBQ. Oddly enough nothing has changed.  The pulled pork is still awesome,  the mac and cheese  (no longer mixed as you wait) was still awesome. The pickles,  sauces and owner,  Oren, are still  awesome.  The price was the same,  the place is still clean and the service got even better.   Good job Naked."}
{"text":"Our favorite Barbecue place to go to in Phoenix. Hands down. We have tried sooooo many places & we never seem to be satisfied. Naked, because his BBQ really doesn't need any sauce. But when you try the sauce, it's to die for. We love the spicy bbq. The mustard to me is my next true love. And with the hot links? Forget about it. Nothing else in the world matters. The brisket melts in your mouth. It's hard to pick what you want. We've tried it. We loved it all. This place will not let you down.  As far as customer service goes. We could tell you this much. Whether it's your first time or your 100th time there, Oren, his wife Marcy & his employees, they will all make you feel like you're family. We've seen great service like this only a number of times in my life.  Lastly, our dreams finally came true a few weeks ago when they are now open for dinner on Friday & Saturday nights. It was hard for us because of our work schedules and we don't have to panic when 3 o clock come around and we're wondering if the meat ran out (They're open until the meat is gone).  Get there when they first open and you'll get your name written on the board, picture taken & posted on their Facebook.  We got on the board a few weeks ago and we felt special and famous lol. And be sure to sign their wall before you leave too."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - KISS - Naked City)  All the Briskets are cooked with smoke, everyone is happy, they're all hungry I'd sacrifice my appetite tonight In Phoenix, Yelp Elites, and hungry people with hungry stares I'm looking for ribs and I'm lost in this slaw  At the Naked BBQ (at the BBQ) there are ten million served (Naked BBQ) I'm shooting for spicy (at the BBQ) at the Naked BBQ (Naked BBQ)   I came to Naked BBQ with my Chef that I worked with.  I've always driven by Naked BBQ and heard great things about this place so of course I had to try!  The place is located right of the I17 Freeway in a small strip mall with one of my favorite Banh Mi Shops.  The process of ordering is like a cafeteria; choose your choice of meats, sides, and amount as they place it on your platter.  I went for the Ribs, Briskets, Mac & Cheese, and the Carolina Slaw.  The meal also came along with some pickles and a mini-muffin corn bread.  For the BBQ sauce I shot for the Sweet and the Spicy BBQ sauces on the side.  Overall, briskets were well cooked and juicy; I would say my favorite of the bunch.  My ribs were dry, but it did fall off the bone; had to add extra bbq sauce to swallow it.  I didn't care for my sides since the Carolina slaw was tangy with a strong vinegar taste.  Guess I don't like vinegar as much as I thought, but if that's your cup of tea; this is your slaw.  My mac & cheese was not as cheesy as I'd expected it to be; I like mac & cheese extra cheesy and creamy.  That pickles were tangy and gave a minor sting to my nostrils while the corn bread; well again expected to be soft and warm, but it wasn't.  Both BBQ sauce were sweet at the end of the day; the spicy just had a after burn, but in my opinion pretty similar.  Though I used more of the spicy BBQ since I needed another element of taste on my palates besides sweet and tangy.    In the end, my visit to Naked BBQ was quick and brief.  I gather it's a Carolina style BBQ which I myself rather enjoy a thicker style BBQ.  However, if that's your thing; sweet and tangy, then Naked BBQ is your place to be! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I liked the brisket better than their pulled pork, which is a testament to how good their brisket is. The menu is nothing fancy but the food is delicious. The ordering system is a bit odd but it's easy to figure out. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Super delicious everything. Tender and juicy. Pulled pork is incredible. Excellent mac n' cheese and savory spicy Carolina slaw. Nice staff and very clean. Will definitely come back next time I find myself in lovey Phoenix!"}
{"text":"On first step in you can tell there's something different about Naked BBQ. People who care enough about what they're selling to make it themselves and make it well. Friendly staff and very easy to find out what we wanted. They smoke their meat daily in house - result - succulent, juicy melt in your mouth brisket with a wake-up-in-the-morning-thinking-about it flavor! Sides and sauces made in house too! Got the slaw and it was such a fresh welcome break from the usual unimaginative restaurants who think that repackaging something they bought at Restaurant Depot is ok. More restaurants like Naked BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic BBQ. The beans, potato salad, and brisket were perfect. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a genuine BBQ joint opening up near Shea/101. Naked BBQ did not disappoint. I've had their chopped brisket sandwich and pulled pork - both were awesome. Tender, juicy and NAKED - leaving the saucing up to you. Both the sweet and spicy sauces are delicious. Sides dishes: mac n cheese, creamy cole slaw, potato salad and baked beans - all delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service with very good BBQ. I enjoyed my quick lunch here the other day.  Staff was very friendly with nice smile. My first time here and was clueless. They took time to explain to me. Manager stopped by our table to check on us. It's not a table service here but appreciate they take time to walk around.  I had pulled pork and chopped brisket, two meat platters. I didn't see a regular brisket on the menu but available. I wish I would have known that. Next time I want to order regular brisket. My favorite sauce was mustered one. Their hot sauce was pretty good too. I enjoyed a few different sauce.  Portion size was huge! I had two types of meat. Corn bread was tasty, I wish it was larger. Side dishes was very good too. Creamy slaw was my favorite so far.  Very clean inside. I mean really clean. Tables, floor, bathroom... I was in my work dress when I visited but I didn't have to worry about where to put my purse or my dress gets messy.   Looking forward to coming back for more soon."}
{"text":"I won a gift certificate on a local radio station that I listen; therefore, with it in hand, I visited the Scottsdale location.   I had actually waited two months, after winning the gc, that I actually got it, but it was truly worth the wait.     I got a pound each of the hot links, pulled pork and the ribs.   And I got the \"hot\" BBQ sauce.   It doesn't really need the sauce.   The meat is succulent and tasty without it.   The hot links were delish, a bit on the \"hot\" side but not much.   The pork is perfect.   The ribs are a bit too fatty.   They are quite good, but with that much fat on it, I dunno.  I think I'd like to check out the slab before buying it next time.  I'd give it five stars but for the fattiness of the ribs.   If it wasn't for that. ...  I'll be returning.   There is a location more on the west side.   Either way, it's definitely worth the trip.   I hope they open a location more centrally located."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed. It's right next to LaMar's Donuts. This is definitely one of the best BBQ places around town! We arrived around 11:45 am on a Wednesday, and there was no line - lucky that we beat the lunch time rush and found seats right away. Shortly after we were seated, people started rolling in big groups.   I had the two meat platter with brisket & pulled pork and mac & cheese + vegetable of the day (green beans) as my sides. There are extra sweet/spicy sauce and the house dry rub (located on the counter) that you can dip/sprinkle to your own liking. The sauce would have been crazy good if it was slightly thicker though, but the taste is still there. Oh boy, that brisket was bomb - super flavorful & juicy along with a nice bark. I requested the brisket to be chopped, but you can also have it sliced. The pulled pork was on the fatty side, but worth the calories. I tried a little bit of my boyfriend's hot links, and they're delicious; I'm getting some hot links next time. I would highly recommend the brisket if you only have one choice of meat. The sides were decent, nothing mind blowing, yet satisfying and compliments the meat well. I love how they weigh the meat we ordered to make sure the right amount is given every time.   I\"ll definitely be returning for those mouth-watering proteins."}
{"text":"In town on business, I saw other good reviews on Yelp and thought I would give it a try.  I had the two meat platter with pork and hotlinks.  Sides were beans and the creamy slaw.  Oh man, mind blown!  The food is unbelievable.  I talked with a worker there and he explained about how they cook the brisket for twelve hours etc. and how they make the rubs.  They definitely know what is going when it comes to BBQ.  So if you are in town, and you have an appetite...I would check out Naked BBQ."}
{"text":"A very solid 4.5 stars.   Stopped by today with my father and knocked out the two meat plate that came with two sides and cornbread. For the meats, I picked the brisket and pulled pork. Both were damn good and flavorful. There were sauce options that I tried and were awesome but the meats easily stand on their own. For the sides, I ordered the Carolina slaw and broccoli. The broccoli was good but the slaw missed the mark for me. The little cornbread provided was also tasty. Overall, the meal was on point and is definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We've tried a LOT of BBQ all across the country and I think Naked BBQ might be up for taking the crown from our previous favorite in downtown Wichita. Cleverly named so as to inform that their meats are not covered up by a slathering of sauce from which the flavor is obtained, Naked's meats themselves are the star of the show. And they do shine indeed!  This may be the most flavorful array of proteins I've ever had. The pulled pork and brisket are a must. And the beef rib is certainly something to behold! Even the sides (we had potato salad, mac and cheese, garlic broccoli, beans, and cornbread) were mild and pure in their taste.  Not to outdo the food, the service and attentiveness of the staff stood out as well. These are people who are very obviously proud of what they serve and really REALLY want you to have an enjoyable and memorable meal. I can't recommend this place highly enough!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Best BBQ  I've had in AZ and I've tried them all. The only complaint is the only Diet Coke they have is caffeine free. Also butter for the cornbread muffins would be nice."}
{"text":"This place just needs a little push and it'll be just right.   First visit was about two weeks ago.  They were out of ribs by 7PM. I ordered the brisket. Too salty. Very tender and moist though.  The server noted my disappointment over the rib outage so I asked for the end cut and was assured of getting it.  Didn't get it.   Bummer. Beans and potato salad were okay.   Second visit was two evenings ago. Got my ribs and they looked beautiful. Alas, I couldn't taste any smoky flavor. And the banana pudding is, well, a joke. Not one slice of banana was present in the creamy pudding. And the 'Nilla Wafers are crumbled on top. And to add insult to culinary injury you'll be asked if you want the cookies included. That stunned me when I was asked the question. Of course I want them...it didn't occur to me that the cookies wouldn't be \"in\" the pudding. Sheesh!  Lastly, the choice of sauces is limited and not what you'll be expecting. There are two of them. Both are heavily vinegar-based. Yuck. Where's the traditional, spicy tomato based BBQ sauces like they have at Dave's??!!??  I'll be back, but it'll be for brisket and/or pulled pork sandwiches. Like a one-car parade they'll be hard to screw-up."}
{"text":"I really liked it. I think its family owned. They have smoked turkey which most places don't. I liked all the different sauces. Staff was efficient and friendly. Had their own dry rub that they had out that you could put on anything. I put it on my turkey sandwich, added a little vinegar sauce to it, slapped some slaw on that bad boy, and then was in heaven. Have more different sides than most and they have a veggie of the day that keeps it interesting. Today was garlic green beans. I found my BBQ place!!!"}
{"text":"What a great little place.  Have had a two meat dinner and added another meat for 4 dollars what a bargain.  My wife and I did not even finish it all have enough for lunch tomorrow. You can see the smoke on the ribs and sliced beef.  We both thought the pork was the best.  Don't forget the home made pickles. One of the best BBQ around give it a try Visited today and really the best BBQ in the valley.  Today the sliced beef was really great.  Guess it depends on the day.  Ribs are the best St. Louis style I have had."}
{"text":"This place is a great option for BBQ in Scottsdale.  Their style is to lightly smoke the meat to let the natural flavors come through without a heavy smoke or seasonings.  And guess what, it works!  I had the brisket, pork ribs, corn and potato salad.  All of the items were excellent.  The little cornbread muffin was a nice touch as well.  The restaurant is squeaky clean and the employees are very friendly.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Top notch food! Amazing service by a friendly staff! I'm keto so I didn't have any of the sides but my family loved the Mac n cheese and cornbread muffins. The homemade pickles were terrific!"}
{"text":"My son and I loved our dinners.  He had a chicken breast sandwich that he couldn't put down and I had the pulled chicken and brisket.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ snob and this was as good as I have had in Arizona. The brisket and pulled pork were unbelievable.  I did not order sides, why fill up on those.  I highly recommend Naked BBQ"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!! And very friendly staff. Drove in from Orange County CA and searched Yelp for a lunch spot. It was perfect. Fast and easy access off highway and delicious food. Fast counter service and price is right."}
{"text":"This little spot has become our go to when we are in the mood for BBQ. OUTSTANDING on all levels. Location is a little hidden from the road, but you will love it when you find it. It a smaller restaurant and can be very busy. Decor is well done. WE ENJOY READING THE COMMENTS  ON THE WALL. FOOD Might be the best BBQ in the valley.  I really like Haps, but this just became our fave. The owner was very nice and let us sample the different  meats our first visit. 5 stars   We are so glad that they are close by. See you soon."}
{"text":"We lived in Texas for 5/6 years and this BBQ is pretty good. Walking in at noon on a Saturday there wasn't a crazy line, nice quiet atmosphere and the people behind the food were super nice, sampled some pulled pork before it got on our platters. We ordered a 2 meat platter with pulled pork and chopped brisket with half a rack of ribs and potato salad and mac and cheese for sides. They also offer pickles at the end and since we were sharing  they threw in an extra cornbread which I thought was nice. Ok so ribs: are the intact not fall off the bone kind with no sauce (which is im guessing where they get the naked part from) they were pretty good had nice flavor not my favorite, brisket other reviews raved about it was nice but kind of dry but the pulled pork was like velvet in my mouth. So juicy and soft my favorite there. Mac and cheese and potato salad were solid as well. Sauces were kind of thin but flavor was good. Overall gave it 5 stars because I love small businesses, the food was solid and the service was great!"}
{"text":"You need to try Naked Barbecue.  Good to have good barbecue in the East Valley  My wife and I went in today. I had the meat platter with Ribs and Brisket. The ribs were as good as any that we had in Kansas City. I liked the brisket as well. Great Cole Slaw and Vegetable side dishes  My wife had the brisket sandwich which was also terrific  Very helpful staff that will let you sample before you chose.  Place was spotless and so think very affordable  We will be back you need to head in for some barbecue as well"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had, their sliced brisket was just perfect, ribs had a just that right smokey flavor, and their banana pudding was delicious"}
{"text":"Quality Q.  They deliberately don't smother their meat in sauce because the quality of the pork or beef stands on its own.  The hot links and the brisket were savory and tender.  Only reason I didn't go 5 stars was I felt the sides were bland.   But the meat is the reason you choose a bbq place and Naked Q does an exemplary job of serving up wood smoked meat."}
{"text":"Damn.... their sweet / spicy sauces are so delicious. Love this place, seriously my favorite bbq joint"}
{"text":"This would be my first visit and the reviews looked good enough for a lunchtime visit! The location is hard to find as it is tucked in a corner suite behind Lamar donuts and next to a tattoo shop. Either way the service was quick and the meal was fresh, light and delicious . This is not like any other BBQ place, in that once I was done with my meal which consists of a brisket sandwich, a side or potato salad and sweet sauce was light ! Not like other places that serve the same kind of food to where I feel like a pig, no pun intended. I will definitely be returning to try out the pulled pork and a variety of side dishes !"}
{"text":"Now open for dinner Friday's and Saturdays!! Unbelievable meats! Brisket #1 hands down. Turkey, amazing- ribs, perfection. Baked beans better than grandma makes!! Going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ!  It's a walk up to the food line and tell them what you want as they pull it together.    Brisket and Chicken were very good, but only luke warm. Order of corn muffins is actually 2 small corn muffins so be prepared, but very tasty. They have 2 types of slaw, we had the carolina slaw which we enjoyed, but definitely not for everyone - vinegary not creamy.  They're very careful to make sure to warn you about that. Mac and Cheese were ok, nothing super fantastic, but then again, I am a mac and cheese snob.  Need some work on their order taking process since it seemed a little slow since the food was pretty much ready to go.  Not quite as good as Smoking Pig BBQ in San Jose, but better than chain Famous Dave's or Dickey's for food quality.  Sorry, didn't go to any other BBQ places in Az, so I can't compare to any other places there."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time here this afternoon. It was lucky that we arrived right before the lunch rush! Oren was super friendly and handed out samples of the delicious hot links while we were waiting. I ordered a platter with the pulled pork and beef brisket. The pork was scrumptious, but the brisket was my favorite -- tender and juicy. Naked BBQ doesn't cover its meats, so the food didn't come slathered in sauce; I added some sweet sauce and vinegar as desired (they also have spicy and mustard varieties). The cornbread muffin and maple bacon donut were a perfect dessert to finish the meal. Ambience is laid back and decor is rustic without being corny. Great neighborhood eatery. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum. Homemade pickles, scrumptious potato salad and cole slaw and that's just the sides. We tried the turkey, pulled pork, brisket and ribs. My only complaints Laing is the temperature, which was warm, but not hot. But it wasn't enough to deduct a star. I might be obsessed with the mustard sauce, but the sweet BBQ and vinegar sauce were also good.   Then I had the maple bacon donut. Do that. Have the maple bacon donut."}
{"text":"Brisket was amazing but I did not like the corn muffins, they were too dry for my taste and also not very sweet. I will be back though for sure. I might give the corn muffins another shot, then."}
{"text":"We drove pretty out of our way to try this place out, since we were headed up to IKEA from Tucson, but it was well worth the trip. I wanted BBQ and specifically pulled pork, and I wanted a Carolina-style vinegar sauce, and that's exactly what I got. We ordered the two-meat plate: Juicy, smokey pulled pork and chopped brisket we dipped into both the vinegar and mustard based BBQ sauce. Their little cornbread muffins were yummy, the mac and cheese was tasty, and the green beans were made even more delicious by ALSO dunking them in the vinegar-based BBQ. We rounded it out with two local craft beers and left happy and full."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with the BBQ here. I've made better pulled pork at home and the ribs are too dry and rough. The sides are bland and the cornbread isn't that great. I'm surprised this place has high ratings, I've had way better BBQ than this place."}
{"text":"Great food! We got the ribs, smoked turkey and the brisket. All really good and really moist. The mac & cheese was delicious. Fresh broccoli wth garlic, really good. Only thing we didn't like, the Carolina slaw was like straight vinegar and the tiny cornbread was bland, no flavor, needed jalapeños and real corn in it, but they had plenty of other sides to pick from. Staff was super nice. We'll definitely  be going again!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and they know their stuff!! I went with a group of 4 and we each tried something different. Definitely recommend the pulled pork, spicy hot link and mac and cheese. They provided sauce as well but the BBQ is so good, you can definitely pass on it. Next time we'll try a dessert too!"}
{"text":"SOME OF THE BEST BBQ IN THE VALLEY. I am a huge foodie & a very tough critic because I've been spoiled by Little Miss BBQ, but the brisket here was awesome and almost as good, and I didn't have to wait in an hour long line! I requested the fatty brisket, hot links, Mac & Cheese & beans. As well as a maple bacon donut for dessert. Everything ROCKED!  Highly recommend this place. Well done Naked BBQ. Thank you for not serving me dry brisket like many other BBQ places in the valley.  In my top 2 best BBQ in AZ list!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite BBQ joint in Phoenix...and I didn't have to wait in line in the hot sun to enjoy it like you do at other BBQ places in PHX.  The pulled pork melts in your mouth.  My hubby ordered the brisket, that was perfectly marbled with fat and melted like butter when bit into.  I love the mac and cheese.  It's perfectly cheesy and not dry at all.  They have a sweet BBQ sauce and a spicy.  I am partial to the spicy.  It goes well on every meat.  They had Mother Road Tower Station on tap when we stopped in, so, yay for craft beer and BBQ!"}
{"text":"Amazing and tasty. Very friendly customer service and a very good experience overall."}
{"text":"Pros: BBQ is simple but flavorful Cons: Sides could use a little work. Not much seating. Overall: Go for the BBQ, you will not be disappointed.  First off, the BBQ is done very well.  They let the meat and the smoke do the talking.  The brisket is tender, rich, and has a light smoke to it.  The ribs are meaty with hint of smoke but a touch sweetness.  The hot links were ok, I expected more heat from it.  Second, the sides could be a bit better.  The macaroni and cheese could have more seasoning to it.  It wasn't overly cheesy or greasy but they could maybe add another type of cheese to round out the flavor.  The potato salad seemed a bit bland and some of the potatoes were a bit undercooked.  The cornbread muffin is small but it does have corn kernels which when bitten give a small sweetness to it.  They offer a side of homemade pickles which is great because it can help cut through the richness of some of the meat  Third, the staff is friendly and the place is small.  There's usually a line but the line goes quickly.  If you go during lunch, you may have to be lucky to find a seat or take your food to go."}
{"text":"I've been to many BBQ places across the country and have enjoyed some of the best, so finding this place in my hometown... thanks to a mutual friend of the owner...has made me happy! Great food, great service, cute little place hidden away in a little strip mall. Right off the 17/Bell. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We came here during lunch to check it out after seeing the rave reviews on yelp. The ordering system is fast and efficient which is a plus. The food however was just okay. The shredded brisket was drier than I'm used to and the cornbread which I usually love with  my bbq was also rather dry and tasteless. The workers and owners were super friendly though and the place was clean and well maintained!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on the place while looking for lunch today. It was a great find! The food is really delicious! I had the 1 meat choice and 2 sides--pulled chicken, baked beans and cole slaw and my guy had the 2 meat platter--brisket and sausage with Mac n cheese and corn. I was pleased that the sides are not heavily salted. However, I think they should offer a larger portion of pickled onions and pickles (bar?) and increase the side choices by offering some southern greens--collards or okra or (lightly creamed) spinach or kale. The brisket was too fatty or my liking. Cornbread is tiny but good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here, and everything was wonderful. I got a pulled pork sandwich with macaroni and cheese. My favorite things were the homemade pickles, the macaroni and cheese and of course the meat. The meat was smokey and tender. The owner was so friendly and even gave my daughter free macaroni and cheese. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pushing mediocre, but no more than that. I had a 2-meat plate with pulled pork and brisket. Meats were cooked well, but didn't pop with flavor. I don't know if it's standard for them, but I think they used the point of the brisket for my sliced brisket. I don't mind a little fat, but more than half of my brisket portion was fat. Overall the meats deserve a 3, but the sides were no good. Potato salad was incredibly bland. Mac n cheese was okay, but pretty dry. The small piece of cornbread was delicious. With all of the options for BBQ in this area, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Took family here tonight, really enjoyed it. Nothing fancy, but good food. We got brisket and pulled pork platters, with peach cobbler and cookies. All quite tasty. Friendly, efficient, staff. My only complaints were the sides. The beans seemed closer to being a chili than BBQ beans, and weren't my thing. Mac & Cheese needed more cheese and to be creamier. Otherwise everything was quite good, and hoping they can improve the sides. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time try from someone not a huge fan of bbq. Had it as take out; brisket, ribs, Mac n cheese, beans, potato salad and spicy sausage. Brisket was great! Sliced preferred. Ribs were really good with the sweet bbq sauce but I also really loved the spicy bbq sauce. Mac and cheese was bland but good if you added bbq sauce. Potato salad was bland it needs something for texture and flavor. I would suggest tackling both with diced pickle. Beans were good they had pieces of meats in it. All in all it was good! Again, coming from someone who doesn't do bbq often."}
{"text":"Great brisket. The owners a nice guy too, good little place"}
{"text":"Have military discount. Staff extra friendly we ordered 2 meats with mac n cheese and greens. Place was clean and I would give more stars but brisket was a little overcooked. The sausage and sides were good though. I definitely feel like they deserve another chance. I will go back the staff were so awesome I have to."}
{"text":"You just can't get any better than this. And that's regarding BBQ and just a restaurant in general.  Randomly found this place when trying to find a place to get dinner. I couldn't have had a better welcome, getting served by the owner Orin. I wanted to try multiple meats but didn't want all the sides, and he recommended getting it by the pound instead. Saved me money and got me what I actually wanted.  Food was delicious. So delicious I took my family back the next night to try more of it. It was all amazing.  Orin is an awesome dude, and so is his staff. I found myself chatting with him about BBQ, past careers, whatever. He is doing a great job and I can't wait until he stays open even later so I can hit this place up more often when I'm in town. Get your butt here!"}
{"text":"First time I didn't have to tell my husband to get naked. Lol no but really naked BBQ is truly a little hidden gem in the valley. I'm so glad we finally came to try to place tonight.the staff was so warm and very welcoming gave us the whole low Down of the meats! Only bummer no ribs today they were sold out. But here is the low down of what we ordered and I posted pictures. So my husband got the prime rib with a baked potato and Mac and cheese he said it was so flavoerful and very tasty. I got the pulled pork sandwich with creamy cold slaw. Omg yummy super tender loved the cold slaw. My mom got the brisket sandwich she put their mustard and BBQ sauce on it she said it was very flavorful. Our son got the pulled chicken and Mac and cheese he said his was the best pulled chicken he has ever had and the mac and cheese he loved! Our nephew got the pulled chicken sandwich he said it was good. The food here is yummy full of lots of flavor we will be only bc we need to try the ribs  Oh also we got one of those yummy donuts with a bacon on top. Must get if they have any yummy"}
{"text":"Very fast service, very friendly employees, had manager stop and ask how was the food , brisket was awesome, the ribs were delicious, the bbq sauce is very good on the taste buds , we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time ever coming and was impressed. Everything tasted so good. My boyfriend who is super picky about bbq loved it. And the owner was the most sweetest person I've have ever met."}
{"text":"My first time here and will definitely be back!  Brisket melts in your mouth!!  A must visit!"}
{"text":"We were visiting and my husband really wanted to try this place. It was delicious!!! We had our whole family with us, and the kids, and the owner was extremely attentive in making sure the kids were happy, and that we were happy with our food. We ordered a bit of everything and it was all so good! Zero complaints and great portion sizes -we all took to go containers! If you're in the area try this place out!!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook. Sliced beef brisket, mac cheese, and creamy coleslaw. Just awesome...and big portions!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for good brisket and they were 100% correct. Went with friends and loved everything we had. Brisket was delicious....juicy and fork tender. we tried the mac n cheese, green beans, baked beans, sausage, chicken and cornbread and it was all super yummy. I ate way too much.  The service was great and everyone was super friendly. We were told on the way out that you could bring your own beer and wine to enjoy with your meal which is nice since they only have soda and ice tea. We will absolutely be back again."}
{"text":"I must admit that the atmosphere is great. Exceedingly friendly and happy staff. The food was certainly good though in my  opinion somewhay dry. The manager has a wonderful passion for his work. My only negative comment is that I ordered during lunch outside of the sandwiches and I found it to be expensive. Nearly $20.00 for 3 main dishes and a drink. However, in complete admission I did not ask the price before ordering. I would suggest that you try ot just stick to a lunch dish."}
{"text":"Had brisket with burnt ends,   very dry they did have a good viniger sauce. Would look for another BBQ restaurant if in the mood for brisket."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Definitely the best brisket I have had. Their ribs & pulled pork are also very good. In terms of sides, the mac n cheese is great, as is the green beans.   However, I really didn't like their slaw. Tasted kind of water-y & bland. Minor point.   Their giant chocolate chip cookie is also pretty good. Definitely try this place out if you love BBQ."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant while visiting in Phoenix based on reviews on Yelp.  We were glad we did. Wow!  I'll say it again, wow!  Very nice staff who explained the menu and made recommendations since it was our first visit.  We were given a sample of the brisket (which I ordered) and I can honestly say I couldn't think of a better one I've had.  \"Naked\" hits the mark because they don't drown the meat in sauces (which are left up to you, if you choose).    The star of the show is the quality of their meat. Tasty, tasty, tasty.  We will return whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"First visit. Had pulled pork sandwich. Sandwiches border on sliders in size. Dense cold brioche bun distracts from the meager amount of lukewarm meat. Sauces uninspired. No other hot sauces available like Tabasco.  Will go back again to see if I missed something."}
{"text":"This place is just phenomenal. I started coming here every Saturday for the last 3 weeks. The staff is friendly and treats you like an actual customer when you walk in. They truly care about there customers. I absolutely love how fresh the meat tastes every time. Regardless of what time of the day you go in. I strongly recommend anyone in the area stop by and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, the owner is top notch and let us taste every meat and side dish before placing a catering order. The meat is tender and smoked to perfection and the Mac and cheese is delicious! They even have peach cobbler with whipped cream!  Yum!What a gem we found today! Needless to say we booked our catering order for a graduation party next week! Try this place, it's really good!"}
{"text":"The smokie flavor is deep here, customer service is on point, and their beef brisket is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening today.  I had the brisket and the pulled pork. It was absolutely moist and very tasty on its own. The home made BBQ sauce was excellent. The corn muffins and bacon maple donuts were delicious as well.   I would totally recommend this place over any of the other bbq joints around the area.   Although I live far from the restaurant I will be coming often."}
{"text":"Attended the grand opening of this new restaurant yesterday and the place didn't disappoint.  This placed is owned by the same person who owns Naked BBQ on Bell.   The food is the same BBQ goodness that you are accustomed at that restaurant.   The only difference is the branding and the setting is much more modern and convenient for people that live in Scottsdale.   I can't wait for them to come down to Chandler."}
{"text":"Brisket point just melted with crispness from the salt and pepper. Great sides including what looks like homemade pickles. Very friendly. Very clean. Not sure why I have to write more than that. Just go get some!"}
{"text":"Saw this place one day while getting donuts in the plaza parking lot, and it smelled great from a distance and was an instant bookmark.    I made it back here for lunch today and they were out of the one thing I wanted; smoked turkey. Extreme disappointment ensued while I sat and ate nothing, vowing to return and try the smoked thanksgiving bird at a later date.   The dining room was clean and fresh with an exposed view back into the kitchen with nothing to hide. Everyone working the counter was very friendly and helpful, even offering their condolences for the missed turkey opportunity.  Coworkers got chopped brisket sandwiches with slaw and mac and cheese. The guys chowed them down without hesitation, thoroughly enjoying their meals.   Can't wait to come back and try the smoked turkey, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"We discovered this gem right after it opened and continue to go back. If you are tired of fast food and looking for quality food delivered at a fast pace with great service, look no further! I have tried just about everything on the menu and their pulled pork with sweet and spicy bbq with a side of Mac n Cheese is my favorite! In my opinion everyone should get naked for lunch! Yum"}
{"text":"My sis and I loved the brisket, pulled pork and greens(were a special) so flavorful, tender, juicy and delicious, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Oren catered a party we had Saturday and the pulled pork and pulled chicken was a 20!!!!  The sides (Mac & Cheese and Beans) were also a 20!!!  People had seconds and thirds of everything it was so good.  It was hot and ready to go when we arrived to pick it up.  The staff at the Scottsdale location are so friendly and nice!  It is the best BBQ in town!"}
{"text":"Tasty meats! Enjoyed mac & cheese for my side. Bun was stale & dry but the meat didn't need bread anyway. No potato option...wish there were fries."}
{"text":"Naked BBQ first grabbed my attention when they initially had their giant \"We Don't Cover Our Meat\" billboard out on Bell Road. Hey, it worked in getting my attention, even though it's since been removed for obvious reasons. Based on the Yelp reviews, I've always wanted to try Naked, but since they would close after lunch, it made the arrangements quite difficult. Thankfully, they now open for dinner hours on the weekend, so my girlfriend and I were finally able to swing by on a Friday night to see if Naked's buzz is justified.  Naked BBQ is fairly small, brightly lit, and offers up a pretty straight forward menu that covers most of the essentials for meat-loving fans. My girlfriend and I both ordered our preferred pulled pork sandwiches with some cornbread muffins. I also requested a side of mac and cheese and some beans, although I wish they would have had the option for mashed potatoes.    First off, the BBQ meat here is absolutely superb! Nice and juicy, tons of flavor, and was good enough that I'd say that it's right up there with some of the bigger guns in the city. You have the option of sweet and spicy sauce. I enjoyed both.  Their cornbread muffins are small, although they gave me an extra one on request for free. They use corn kernels inside, which I've never been a fan of (see my Lo Lo's review), but that's more of a subjective opinion than a quality issue. Others seem to love it. It's southern-style cornbread, which means that it's not overly sweetened. Overall, I thought they were pretty good.  Sides are kind of small, but since the prices here are pretty fair, I can't really complain too much. The mac and cheese was okay. Although not the best I've ever had at a BBQ joint, it was still passable and better than what many other places serve out. The beans were also decent enough.  In summary, I give this place credit, because absolutely nothing we ate here was bad. For a small place that is still fairly new, I consider that to be a very commendable!    We'll definitely be back in the future, as I really want to try their hot links and perhaps one of their desserts. Plus, I need about a month to figure out something witty to write on their wall that isn't filled with the usual cliches.    Highly recommended BBQ that definitely delivers the goods. Well done!"}
{"text":"Naked BBQ over on I-17 and Bell Road has been dishing out some pretty decent meat for awhile now. So, I was not surprised when I heard that a second location in Scottsdale would be opening up. Although the Yelp lists the restaurant as \"Naked BBQ,\" it's actually called NakedQ.  If you're familiar with the original location on Bell, you'll find an identical menu and similar setup - sans the writing on the walls.   I ordered a meat platter of both chopped and sliced brisket, while my girlfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich. I opted for a side of mac and cheese and decided to forgo my second side option for extra cornbread muffins.   Now, as I've stated in my review of their other location, Naked, on a good day, can deliver BBQ that's right up there with some of the best that we've found in our search. Although unfortunately, not every day is a \"good\" day. The quality of the meats were decent, as they usually are, but everything was a bit too cold for some reason. The brisket was good, although not quite as smoky as I remember. The pulled pork was fine, but also not quite as warm as what's considered to be the norm. I'm not sure what all this was about, but it's always a risk when you decide to branch out.  As I rant about in almost every BBQ review I write, it's usually not the meat that's the problem, it's the quality of the sides. Naked's mac and cheese is just okay, while their cornbread muffins are the kind that incorporate actual corn itself and traces of jalapeno. It gives it more of that \"soufflé\" type of taste, that isn't really my thing.  Overall, despite my minor complaints, I still think this is one of the better BBQ joints that we've found in our search. It's nice to see that their success has enabled them to open a second location, although I think in the future, I'll stick to the original.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee there Ribs!! Fall of the bone perfectly smoked and the sauce is to dieee for. Employees are friendly and make you feel welcome. Love the decor as well... very clean especially since bbq can get kind of messy."}
{"text":"Great food I always come here when I'm at that side of town plus they're always busy but today I came in at 1:30 p.m. and it wasn't busy which I like and the food the food is awesome and delicious Chris, Guy and the owner very helpful and understanding plus they work with the customers a little bit on the pricey side but still worth it"}
{"text":"Took a chance and I loved it.  Pulled pork, Mac n cheese and beans.  Portions were great and service super fast.  All the reviews are right.  It's a great spot, hard to find but worth it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Naked BBQ through Yelp reviews as we we're driving into Phoenix. This unassuming place is spot on for BBQ. The pulled chicken sandwich was lightly smoked and had good texture. The mustard and sweet sauce were a great compliment to the meat. My husband had pulled pork which was good too. The side of beans were very well done. The team there is friendly and conversational. They're smoking in oak and pecan in house and making sauces on site as well. You can't miss when you seen about 10 police people leaving happy when you walk in!  I work in the food industry in sauce manufacturing and this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Salad was phenomenal, the people who work here were top notch. Wow, just discovered and found my new fave bbq spot. The manager/owner was so sweet and provided with a fresh made giant chocolate cookie! Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Great food and the best spicy bbq sauce! The staff was so friendly and helpful with suggestions. I would give 5 stars but it would be nice to have a small kids menu."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Strange that a place known for serving BBQ without sauce has the BEST BBQ SAUCE I ever tasted. They keep it warm in a heating pot in the back. Regular and spicy are available, both very sweet and tasty.  The meat is super tender and it's no mystery why it's crowded at peak times but service is so fast the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"Welcome to 85258 Naked BBQ!  This new restaurant serves up the finest BBQ in Scottsdale.  Same great food as the other location on Bell and I-17 but this one has plenty of extra room to dine in, open for dinner and...best of all...beer and wine!   I have been a regular at the other location for quite some time now.  ANY time I'm in the area I get take out meat by the lb. (***tip*** meat is the same price per lb. no matter if 1/4, 1/2 etc. so you can buy a little if you want!)  Their chopped brisket sandwich is my favorite and it's available sliced as well.  Sometimes burnt ends are available too (a true culinary delicacy)  ....those are amazing here!   Although the whole naked concept is true i.e. this Q needs no sauce, the BBQ sauce here just so happens to be the best I have ever had!  The irony is delicious!   All the BBQ sauces are great but the spicy one is my favorite. It has just the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  They're kept in electric warmed pumps in the corner near the drink fountains for dine in guests.  Pre-made containers of their liquid ambrosia are available to go at the register.  Woo Hoo! Naked BBQ!  For opening day today I got half a rack of ribs.  Came in starving and it kept me full all day!    Can't wait to return for prime rib Friday night and beef rib Saturday night!    Those pics to come ...watch this space!"}
{"text":"just moved back to arizona after being gone too long and bbq is my favorite and couldnt wait to try this place seeing that it had 4.5 stars.  Now either i came on the wrong day or time of the day or these people that give it good ratings have never had decent bbq.  I never put much bbq sauce on anything and sometimes none but i had to flood the brisket sandwich in the sauce just to try and eat it, it was so dry and didnt taste good at all. the mac n cheese had no flavor. the beans tasted out of a can. my wifes chicken was very dry also. i struggled to finish the sandwich and this has never happened with bbq.  one of the guys at the front counter was very friendly and great, the guy at the register was lazy, we sat at the closest table to the register and he puts in on the counter for us to get instead of him taking 2-3 steps and putting it on our table. also, ive never been served bbq food this fast, not even at dickeys,, that is most likely the problem here. food sitting around."}
{"text":"Service was good and friendly. I had the ribs platter with potato salad and beans. Ribs were great. I had the spicey side-sauce and it was good. I like baked beans and these were \"western\" mixed beans. But they were still good. :)  If you want bbq, it hits the spot! Thanks to everyone who wrote previous reviews because it helped me and my co-workers find this place."}
{"text":"Here's to another great place to have lunch!!! I had seen this place driving by but hadn't had the time to stop in. Today was the day. As I open the door a sweet smell of home cooking ticked my nose. I walked into smiling faces and a welcoming vibe. I told them this was my first time and recommended that I get the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese. As watched him pile the meat on my bun, I knew I was in the right joint! Once my sandwich was made and paid, I went over to the drink area. I was pleasantly surprised with the choices of sauces and iced tea. I had the watermelon and sweet tea mix. I picked a seat and dove in. With the soft sounds of country music and friendly owner checking on everyone, I felt at home. Everything was beyond my expectations. I'm coming back tomorrow and bringing my family!!!!!! I'll go naked anytime"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional. The brisket is so tender and full of flavor. And the service was great. Visiting from the PNW, I was looking for some good Southwest BBQ. Boy, did I stumble upon a gem when I went here. Delish!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and got a pulled pork sandwich, carolina slaw and Mac & cheese. Overall the food was good with the exception of the slaw being a little too strong on the spice & vinegar (and I really love vinegar).  The Mac and cheese was above average and the pulled pork was better than almost all other places I have eaten at in az with the exception of Little Miss BBQ.  The interior of the restaurant and presentation of the food was very nice and they had a great assortment of sauces and some pretty decent dry rub to add to the meat.  To sum it up I would for sure eat here again it if they are consistent with their meat it will be a great BBQ restaurant to have in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place  Great food, great service, I wish I could keep it a secret but that would not be right"}
{"text":"I love barbeque!  I have smoked hundreds of briskets over the decades and have had the pleasure to sampled pits throughout the country.  I came very close to opening a pit in Scottsdale in 1998.  I am partial to beef and most enjoy Texas rubs and oak smoke.    I looked through the reviews and have a few comments to add.  I thought the brisket  had a enjoyable flavor.  I asked for some bark and was rewarded.  Thank you.  I agree with other reviews that the cold, thick bun is a detractor.  That's an easy fix for a new store.  I found the potato salad bland.  I am partial to onion, mustard and celery as boosters.  I would like to see sliced brisket added to the menu.   I love chopped brisket for the flavor (the fat) but a good prime flat will provide the reputation and a return crowd in the Scottsdale health conscious . For sauces the sweet would be better on the pulled pork and the tangy was not very appealing  I often make the brisket I sample stand on its own adding very minimal, additional flavors.  I say be flexible and try some different things.  Mix it up for a week and see what your fans share back.  Good Luck."}
{"text":"Ordered a pound of pulled pork and a pound of brisket to bring to my Final Four tailgate. Even reheated the pulled pork was tender and flavorful and the brisket was out of this world.  Thanks for making the tailgate a hit!"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich, with the spicy BBQ sauce, beans and the vinegar pickles and onions.  The food was good and the staff was efficient and friendly. Since my last review I've had a chance to have the ribs and brisket. The brisket can not be described by any other word than amazing!"}
{"text":"Woooooo Doggies.....yall gotta try this place! I am from Texas and my wife is from North Carolina, so we are always searching out BBQ that meets our standards and this place did not disappoint. We ordered a pound of sliced brisket and a pound of pulled pork. The brisket was melt in your mouth tender and rivals any of my hometown favorites. They sliced it up with a nice mix of lean and fatty with a nice bark. The pork was equally impressive and the vinegar sauce is the authentic Carolina style my wife has been missing and craving. We did not try any sides this time (it's all about the meat with me and BBQ), but I definitely will when I return. Kudos to the pit master...i haven't found anyone in Phoenix that can smoke brisket like that!"}
{"text":"Came during lunch time with some co-workers. 2 meat platter was great (Sliced brisket and Pulled pork) and side of mac'n cheese  Great BBQ place overall. BBQ sauces are also delicious!"}
{"text":"We tried this for take out tonight and it was so good! The brisket was by far my favorite. The Mac and cheese was good, but could use more sauce. The potato salad was not as flavorful as the other items we tried, so I'd try a different side next time. Very good and I'd go back for the brisket for sure."}
{"text":"This place looks like a food chain along the lines of Chipotle.  I don't believe that is a bad thing as Chipotle (chain aside) is generally well liked.  You get the same vibe walking into this joint, but so far it is the only location they have.    The owner is a very passionate mad as he assaults you with information when you enter the door.  He comes off very knowledgeable and happy to explain why you are going to enjoy your meal.    I tried the pulled pork and the briquette both times.  The pulled pork isn't my favorite pulled pork but, it is still very good.  The briquette is very good.  Every side they have is very good.  The place is clean, well organized, and customer service is top-notch.    I believe you're going to see more locations in the valley and this will become a place that is right up there with the likes of Honey Bear's BBQ.  I think Honey Bears is very good as well but the customer focus at Naked BBQ is refreshing.  You really feel like they care and they want your experience to be as good as the food is."}
{"text":"This place was hands down delicious!!!  Staff and owner are very friendly and inviting!!"}
{"text":"We came here and got two sandwiches: Brisket and Pulled Pork. It was 8 bucks for each sandwich and a side - we both chose mac and cheese.  The sandwich was ok, I didn't find it to be super flavorful. The meat was decent but we didn't care for the bread at all. It was dense and dry and really made the whole experience - dry. I did end up putting some of the BBQ sauce they had on it and it made it a bit more tolerable. I found the mac and cheese to be the best part of the meal.  Overall it was decent. I wasn't blown away by the taste, price, serving size or side. It's not something I'd go out of my way to get again. Perhaps the plates/combos are the better choice but the sandwiches just didn't do anything for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for some good BBQ in the area, so naturally we turned to yelp to find something. Naked had great reviews, so we gave it a try. I had a brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans and my husband had the brisket plate with coleslaw and Mac n cheese. Ordering was easy and they plated everything out right there on the line. The decor was cute and simple. They have sauces that are kept warm that are a great (and needed) addition to the brisket for flavor and because it was kind of dry. The beans were okay, but not a lot of flavor to them. Same with the coleslaw. The Mac n cheese was good though. The brisket had good flavor to it. The biggest reason this review is not getting more stars is because my husband found a long hair in his brisket and another in the baked beans. If it weren't for that I'd give it 4. We're not sure if we'll be returning due to that."}
{"text":"I've seen this place many times but never stopped. That was a mistake. Went today as they opened the doors at 11:00am. Without question the best brisket I have ever eaten.  And the pulled pork was in my top 3. Small, simple menu but what more do you need than amazing meats and a few side selections at a very reasonable price. The owner and all employees were incredibly friendly, made us feel like we'd been long-time customers on our first visit.  I WILL be back, many times. Don't make my mistake, get in here NOW!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews, live down the street.  Staff was smiling, food was exceptional.  Love the decor from the wooden tables with the branding in the wood.  We will come back again and again.  Prices are great.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Below average food - nice staff.  These \"5 star\" reviews for Naked BBQ must be paid.  The 90th Street location serves cold buns fresh out of of the bag completely plain and unprepared. There is no heating or toasting of the bun.  The meat is kept lukewarm at best. So you are getting a cold bun out of a bag with lukewarm meat that is just average.   Big deal.  They don't even offer \"sliced brisket\" ... just the chopped brisket (which includes all the fat and gristle that would normally be thrown away)    The baked beans are neither sweet nor spicy. They are not even cowboy style beans.  Plain and bland would be the best description. Canned beans are definitely better.  The cole slaw is sub par to what you get across the parking lot at Frys deli.    The BBQ sauce is terrible. Gross would be an understatement  Any store purchased BBQ sauce, such as Guy Fieri Carolina BBQ, will be ten times better.    My gut feeling is that someone visited Dickeys BBQ on 32nd and Indian School and tried to copy it.  Anyone who thinks this is 5 star BBQ hasn't visited Dickeys on 32nd street.   On a positive note, that the staff was very nice.  5 stars for the staff.    Some advice to the owners: 1) Toast your buns 2) Provide better BBQ sauce options 3) Redo all of your sides  The Sweet tea was OK but not on par with most other sweet tea.  In this shopping center you'd be better stopping at Whataburger. Better food, better tea, less money."}
{"text":"Wow, the sweet BBQ sauce is addictive.  This is a very cool casual BBQ place at I-17 & Bell Road next to Carrambas Mexican.  Kind of hidden in that strip mall and the place is not very big but very clean and the service was great.  You can tell the guys believe in their product and it shows.  I love supporting places like this and I think the sauce is better than Pork on a Fork up the road.  I only tried the BBQ Turkey sandwich but I will be stopping by again soon for the good stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and needed a quick lunch. We stopped in here and got a pulled pork bbq sandwich and a chopped brisket sandwich. We had creamy coleslaw and beans as the sides.  The pork and brisket were good. We enjoyed the sauces as well. The sides lacked. Overall it's good and it's a cool little place. They do serve beer and wine. However it's a bit on the pricey side for what you get."}
{"text":"While the BBQ is good, the wait times, selections, and price make this mostly not worthwhile. The spicy bbq sauce should also be what it is; spicy. If it's too spicy for some they should be smart enough to go with the regular or mix the gall to bring it to their level. Right now spicy means regular with a dash of pepper."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is great and the customer service was amazing! I truly felt welcome here and all of the staff made sure our experience was a good one. I am so glad it is right down the street from my house because I will be here a lot!"}
{"text":"I came on my lunch break and ordered to go. I was in and out within 5 minutes. pulled pork Mac and cheese and potato salad is delicious. just wish they gave more corn muffins"}
{"text":"Delectable brisket, satisfying sausage and boffo beans made for a 5-star experience. And the servers were mighty pleasant, too."}
{"text":"This was the BEST chopped beef brisket I've ever eaten!  The potato salad was great.  Ask if the baked beans are spicy each time.  Today's batch was too spicy for me but I was warned in advance which was very nice of them.  Excellent sweet tea!  The staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I love me some good BBQ and until this place opened, the only place I would go to is Little Miss BBQ.  Now don't get me wrong, Little Miss is still beyond amazing, but Naked is right there with their brisket and hot link.  I live in North Scottsdale and this location is about a mile from us.  The hours are wonderful as I can pick up some BBQ after work.  The best there: brisket, hot links, prime rib (on Fridays!) and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Wow, I am late getting this review up! My beau and I went in over a month ago and we are STILL talking about this place. Oren, sorry if I spelled that wrong, has built up a great little place here. The simple recycled decor is nice, the staff is helpful, the portions are very filling, and the food is amazing!  We snuck in here when we actually had pulled in across the lot to have Indian food, I swear we will get to you someday!!! So we popped in, not expecting too much but were blown away by the service we received. We were initially greeted by the staff with quick hellos and welcomes. They asked if it was our first time in and walked us through the menu, and what they had left. We did get in late so not everything was in stock. Oh well, just one more reason to go back!   Oren was right there at the counter talking to us as we ordered or plates. He was so nice and came out to talk to us a few times while we were eating. Since it was so close to closing and the had a few left he gave us some chicken wings to try and the were just as good as everything on our plates.   Now some would expect the owner of a business to be a little uptight and even rude but Oren was great! He is very proud of his business, as he should be; but also knows when to tip his hat to another business and give them dues too.   Over all we had an amazing experience and we will be back, we promise! We had the pulled pork, smoked sausage, slaw, Mac and cheese, home made pickles, and the chicken wings and brisket he let us sample. Everything was amazing!!   Trust me we waddled out of there. Oh, and if you happen to stumble across the maple bacon donut, forget your diet, forget about carbs and fat. Just grab it. Don't ask questions, just grab it and don't share. Ok, maybe share. We shared one, and it was so yummy!"}
{"text":"Here on business and craving some BBQ. Was really impressed. Staff / manager were nice and friendly. I had the pulled pork and ribs with Mac and cheese and corn bread. Their sweet / spicy sauce was awesome and went well with the pulled pork. Will definitely visit again next time we're in town!! Oh, and grab yourself a maple bar with bacon... Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Meat was awesome. Work on the beans. Great staff and owner."}
{"text":"Brisket is unbelievable!  Loved every bite!  Being born and raised in Texas, almost every Phoenix BBQ joint is far below my expectations...until today!  The brisket was tender, juicy, perfectly smoked and so good, I didn't have time to take a picture.  Friendly counter service and the place had lots of people enjoying their meals, too.  I'll be back and soon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and friendly. Finally a great bbq place in Scottsdale. Extremely friendly staff, cleanliness was a priority, but best of all...the brisket, homemade pickles and marinated onions! The green beans were smoky and great! I'll be back at least once a week for lunch. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Such a great BBQ place! Very friendly staff and the food is great. Their homemade pickles are to die for! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I would not give this place any stars if i was allowed to. Only thing that tasted good was the soda. This place is clean and that is the only thing  i liked about it.   Should have known things would not be good when they measure the food like they are giving you a prescription. I understand portion control but this went beyond that.   I could have gone to the deli at the supermarket and got better smoked meats. That should just about cover the smoked portion of the review.   Over all this place sucks. Famous Daves put this place to shame and i only go there when i don't want to drive far for bbq.   For all you Star Trekkies out there we are putting a quarantine marker on this place to avoid at all costs.   I guess all the good reviews come from all the seniors who forgot what bbq tastes like while their dementia sets in."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem close to my work for BBQ. The staff was amazing and knew the menu. My friend is gluten free and they were able to answer all question to put her mind at ease. The BBQ was amazing and size as well. I got the chicken sandwich and Mac cheese. It was big meal so I was able to take half home for later. I will be coming back again. I enjoyed the environment and food."}
{"text":"Brisket Sandwich + Mac n' Cheese = Taste explosion."}
{"text":"This place was really good!  Came in for lunch w/ my husband and they move really quick.  They serve the meat 'naked' and have three different types of BBQ sauces.  I had the chicken, green beans and potato salad.  The chicken was so moist, and I mixed the sweet and hot sauces together, so yummy.  The green beans were really good as well.  I wasn't a fan of the potato salad, but i'm picky when it comes to potato salad, my husband liked it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really just average bbq place. Bbq restaurants are everywhere these days and most are way better than this one. Subpar sides highlighted by a cornbread muffin as big as a ping pong ball and about as hard and dry. The mac and cheese was very dry also, not gooey and cheesy. The  brisket was good, but not worth the trip. Both bbq sauces were lame, especially the spicy which was mild at best. I give this place 6 months tops unless the owner has more money than brains."}
{"text":"This may be ok for AZ BBQ, but I'm from Texas and this was hardly up to god bbq standards. Their bbq sauce is really thin and not very good, the meat was dry, and the slaw/potato salad/mac n cheese was nothing to write home about. Was so excited to try this place after the reviews and was really disappointed"}
{"text":"First time! I ordered a two meat meal to-go. The hot links, pork, mac n cheese, baked beans and the corn muffin.  I really enjoyed it. Everything was tasty. Both sweet and spicy sauces were delicious. I thought the corn muffin was a little lacking but that definitely isn't a dealbreaker for me. I am from the South so I am familiar with barbecue southern style. This was more like Texas to me. The variety of slaws and the vinegar sauces made me think  NC as well. I think its neat that it seems to be a little Texas, NC style and Southern at the same time."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places that tout that they have the best barbecue but hands down this place is the best in town. I've traveled all over the country have had all types of BBQ this is one of the top 5 places I've ever been to out of the hundreds I've  eating at. I had a simple prime rib sandwich that was out of this world the flavor of the smoke the horseradish sauce that they put on plus the barbecue sauces that I sampled were out of this world. I had beans for a side and they were dynamic can't wait to come back when I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"The pulled chicken and collard greens were good. One of the guys suggested I mix the sweet tea with the watermelon tea and it was a good taste. Thanks guys ."}
{"text":"Who raised me? The owner just threw me an extra rib at lunch. I didn't even pick up my head to say thank you. Why? I was memorized by the brisket and ribs on my plate and my head was in the cloud. This places rocks every single time I eat there. Thanks for the rib! Thanks for the first rate BBQ!"}
{"text":"Such a refreshing way to enjoy BBQ food! The meat flavor alone with just the smoke is sinfully good, add your choice of  sauce to up the factor. The ribs are the best I have ever had in the long life of mine. Can't wait to go back, can't wait to spread the word about this true gem of an eatery!"}
{"text":"Our first visit a few months ago was great.  Today I stopped in and got 2 briskets dinners to go. I should have tasted it before I left.  Both the chopped and sliced briskets we got were so salty that they were inedible.  We stopped trying to choke it down and just threw it away."}
{"text":"Wow! Wonderful customer service and the best bbq in town! Their spicy BBQ sauce is to die for! Very happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"My family is from \"The South\" so it's rare we find a BBQ place that reminds us of home. The vinegar bbq sauce is amazing, I could drink it, it's that good. But I didn't have to because this place has great sweet tea! Went with my guy once and then dragged my parents out from Tempe to try it within a week. The employees are friendly and almost as attentive as a sit down restaurant. The food is hot, and they weigh it so you are consistently getting the same amount. THE PICKLES are out of this world, eat them! If you don't like pickles you should still try them cuz they rock! I'm pretty certain that, in just two visits, I have become low key obsessed with this place.   The ONLY bad thing I have to say is that my peach cobbler was runny, but that may be due to the temperature at which I was serve - a little too hot. Still tasted good but it should be more firm."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Everytime I have gone I've loved my food.  It's fresh, delicious, fast and great prices.  My only \"suggestion\" is real Diet Coke, not Coke Zero or caffiene  free Diet Coke."}
{"text":"\"Open from 11:00 until the meat is gone\" such an organic business model. Oren runs a friendly hospitable staff with high quality foods. The simple menu won't leave you wanting. Being on the end of the strip lends itself well to light open and airy environment."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is amazing! We also love the Mac cheese. So happy that they opened on the east side of town....best BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for lunch. We shared the 2-meat platter for $14. It comes with a small cornbread muffin and 2 sides. We chose pulled pork and chopped brisket with slaw and potato salad.  The pulled pork and brisket was tasty and something we'd get again. The pulled pork is a little on the fatty side though (had some chunks of fat still attached). But, I'm letting that slide. I liked the pulled pork more than the brisket, while my husband like the brisket more. They were both tasty, though!  The potato salad was ehh...ok. It was sort of bland. The slaw was really good... very fresh tasting. The pickled onions and cucumbers that come with the dish were amazing and goes really well with the whole dish.  I didn't eat any BBQ sauce with it. They have two types of BBQ sauce: sweet or spicy. Honestly, they taste completely the same. They are both very sweet for my taste. My husband ate his portion with the sauce, but I ate mine with the mustard sauce they have.  We'll probably come back again. My husband likes this place better than BobbyQ."}
{"text":"Naked BBQ is BOMB.com!!! Pulled pork was delicious, mac and cheese was amazing, and the roasted broccoli (the veggie of the day) was awesome. I tried both the sweet and spicy sauce and though both are good, I preferred the sweeter sauce with my pulled pork. My friends ordered the brisket, hot links and a pulled pork sandwich and had nothing but great things to say about the food here. The interior and ambiance is pretty cool and relaxed. Great food for such an affordable price! Why haven't I been back yet???  The location of the restaurant can be a bit tricky to find as the surrounding and intersecting parking lots can be confusing. The size of the restaurant itself isn't terribly small but once the lunch crowd comes I imagine it can get pretty packed. I'm excited for my return visit since I do want to try more items on their menu. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Owners are very friendly. They are going to have to expand cause there just isn't enough room anymore with their growing popularity."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite bbq places I've been to in all of Phoenix. I've been here now three times and it just opened a couple weeks ago. The chicken and turkey are very good with the perfect amount of smokey flavor. BBQ sauce is delicious and so is their Mac and cheese! The side of beans are a little on the spicy side but pretty good. My husband really likes the brisket. The restaurant is nice and clean too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome !! Especially the smoked turkey and the ribs !! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and offered us some samples so that we could decide what to order !! My husband and I will definitely be going back to try some more of the delicious food there !!"}
{"text":"Its a no e small menu place like Chipotle. We got the pulled pork sandwiches, she got cornbread I got Carolina slaw. The slaw has a kick to it, was great on top if the sandwich. Liked both their sweet and spicey sauces.   About $20 for a quick BBQ fix for two, will be here again for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the valley. Great food, great sides, great people but not having brisket point or fatty brisket lost them a star. This will be your go to bbq joint and mine when they serve point meat. I will keep coming here as everything I tasted was good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Naked. I had heard of it but had not had a chance to try it. We ordered some brisket, chicken, sides we got Mac n cheese and potato salad. The food came with cornbread muffins. For dessert we ordered a banana pudding and a peach cobbler. The brisket was amazing. Super moist and tender. The bbq sauce is really good too. The pulled chicken was good, not as good as the brisket. It was a little dry but with the sauce still good. The Mac n cheese was decent. I cook so I'm use to homemade Mac n cheese but it was decent and the potato salad as well. Definitely better than most sides I have tried at bbq spots. The cornbread muffin was also good. Now let's get to the dessert. Terrible. Both the banana pudding and the peach cobbler. Possibly the worst I've ever tasted. I was surprised because the food was good. So I expected the dessert to be the same. Nope don't do it. Naked needs to contract out for dessert. And I have people who make amazing banana pudding and cobbler if they need numbers. Finally I think it's a little pricey. Not too bad but it's a bbq joint nothing fancy and a meal Can come to $30 or so. I'll be back. The brisket is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Monday with my wife. We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich which turned out to be the special for the day -only $5 each, with a side. I had the cole slaw while she had Mac and cheese. The sandwiches were delicious and decently sized for the price. Would have preferred that the bun wouldn't have been cold (as in refrigerated). Cole slaw was good, not great. Mac and cheese was excellent. The pork itself was tender and juicy and included some of the crispy edges, which we love. They have four sauces - mustard, vinegar, sweet, and spicy). My favorite today was the vinegar sauce. I suppose I must have been channeling North Carolina. My wife loved the sweet - a real fan of Kansas City BBQ. It really was good, as was the spicy. Mustard sauce, too, but I'm not a huge mustard sauce fan. We will most definitely be back. I have to try the brisket. One Yelper complained about fatty sections of brisket, so it is really calling to me (that's where the flavor is in beef). Then at least another trip to taste the links. Eat. Enjoy. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Thank goodness I only live 6blocks away."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Owner came out and talked with us and made us feel very welcome!! Definite go to place for bbq!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I'm always a little wary when my bf suggests we get bbq for lunch or dinner. Part of that stems from the fact that so many bbq places focus on pork and your fave muzz over here can't eat dat piglet. The other part of my wariness stems from the number of meh bbq joints that we've been to that never make me feel like, \"Damn I want to come back here!\"   After visiting my brother in Austin, TX and having (and loving) what was arguably some of the best bbq in the world, I now know that I am not the problem in this bbq relationship. I also have a confession: if good bbq brisket was a man, I'd marry him stat mcgat.  That's how much Texas changed my poor little naive bbq brain.   Now I'm sure you're wondering, when the heck is this weird girl going to tell us about Naked BBQ? Patience, my dear friends, which is incidentally enough the quality you need most when smoking that tasty dry rubbed slab of meat that we all know and love. Naked BBQ is pretty much as close to Texas bbq as I'll get in the old southwest. The service was friendly and helpful and the prices were VERY reasonable for what you're getting. Obvi I was bummed that the beans had bacon in them, but the mac and cheese was so yummy that I forgot all bummed feelings immediately.   I got the brisket and dayum was it tasty. The bark on the outside of the meat is nice and flavorful and crispy, without being too peppery. The meat itself is juicy and tender and falls apart very easily. I will say I got a particularly fatty part of brisket, which I only knew bc I compared my pieces to those of my bf's meal. That's a very minor thing though and obviously with bbq, sometimes it's the luck of the draw.   Anyway...........naked bbq lived up to my expectations and I shall return for more! I'd go back now buuuuut you know, I don't want to die at 25 of heart failure due to consumption of massive amounts of animal fat."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come in today and boy does Yelp not lie!!  This place was truly amazing. A 2 meat platter is enough to feed 2 people, but if your greedy with BBQ like me, you'll keep it to yourself. Meat and BBQ sauce was amazing although i couldnt really tell the difference between the hot bbq sauce and sweet one? Hmm. Bacon Maple donut for dessert?!? MUST TRY. Peach Cobbler with whip cream was awesome too!  Was SO FULL but couldnt stop EATING because it was SO FREAKING GOOD. The owners are very friendly too, and they really care about their customers. Taking time to remember names and where they come from, as well as constantly coming to the tables talking to you making sure your happy. Not just a \" how is everything?\" and walking away.. No, no, no, they are bound to have more of a conversation with you."}
{"text":"Ok I tried it. The beef brisket was very tender but had no flavor. Beans were not my favorite,Potato salad bland and dry. Peach cobbler , Crust was tasteless peaches were good. .Corn bread had no flavor. Would have been great to a have a really good place for BBQ.Food was to go and I got the sweet sauce the containers are very small."}
{"text":"Food was really yummy!  I had the ribs, juicy, tender - really good.  My group had pulled pork, brisket, baked potatoes, mac and cheese, beans and broccoli.  We sampled the whole menu!  My only complaint is that the food wasn't hot, just warm.  The place is clean, very neat.  Self serve is convenient.  Decor is great.  Service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Tonight's the first time I ordered from here. It's really good. The ribs are tender, and the sides are good. Great BBQ that's ready in minutes. Definitely will order from here again. Their customer service was great as well. All around pleased."}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ. Hard to find a good BBQ joint around now a days. This place is the go to for us!  Great brisket and great beans and very pleasant staff. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Above average brisket and large portions, but those are the only thing that set Naked BBQ above the crowd of mediocre BBQ chains.  Their second best meat may be the pulled pork, which is tender and moist but not particularly tasty.  I tried five of the seven available sides and only one was worth reordering - the creamy slaw.  The meat is served without sauce (\"naked\") and the two sauces they have appear to be identical except for the heat, and neither is what you would describe as fabulous.  Prices are typical but since the meat portions are large, Naked BBQ provides a reasonable value.  Ambience is modern lunch counter and does nothing to remind me of BBQ."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ at very reasonable prices. Located very conveniently across from Fry's market with plenty of easy parking."}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled upon Naked Barbeque! Absolutely delicious! I had the brisket, creamy coleslaw and a corn muffin! The décor is so cute too! Can't wait to come back and try different meats!"}
{"text":"Im not sure how this place got 5 stars. The service was friendly. We oreered 2 sandwhich combos one with brisket and one with pulled pork- my husband tells me the pork was not terrible.  But the chopped brisket was sad, it was tough and dry and flavorless. We got mac n cheese- which was disgusting to watch being made to order,  and tasted equally as gross (semi undercooked pasta with flavorless cheese sauce, which just slipped off the noodles), as well as creamy coleslaw and cornbread muffins which were both just...blah The dining space was messy... the sauces were too sweet. I wanted to like this place... but sadly not worth a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Tasty and wonderful! Had a rib plate... as a take out order. Corn muffin was yummy."}
{"text":"We tried Naked BBQ based on the Yelp reviews. I mean, it's not every day you find a 4.5 star rated restaurant in this area of town.   The aroma of the smoked meats greeted us like an old friend as soon as we opened the door to enter. The staff was friendly, funny and fast. We had both the turkey and the brisket sandwiches. Both sandwiches were piled high with meat, naked, as the name implies. Smoke flavor was nicely balanced and both types of meat were moist. We enjoyed the beans, but the broccoli was fantastic. We also snagged a sample cup of both the sweet and spicy sauce. Pretty tasty!  I will return for more delicious bbq and sides very soon! Hubby wants to try the ribs next time."}
{"text":"Great location easy access!! U can smell smoked meat as soon as you enter. Greeted with Great customer service along with beautiful smile along with a great food! Owner is very attentive. Will be back already!!"}
{"text":"Almost a 5! The pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese were wonderful! We loved the warm bbq sauce as well. We also had banana pudding which would have been better had they made it with actual bananas in it. The peach cobbler was good but more like a little peach pie."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Great burnt ends.  Meat is very well smoked.  Salad is so good.  Love the fast, Chipotle-style experience.  Get in and out quickly!  Love their banana pudding.  Wish they had fries too but it's a win for a BBQ joint in Arizona.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If you like traditional bbq you can't do any better than this place .  The owner was on site and he makes sure everything is done to perfection.. everything is good but my personal faves are the ribs ,brisket and burnt ends. Don't forget the sides of Mac n cheese ....and the muffins are delightful!.... to die fir."}
{"text":"How quintessentially Phoenix: An outstanding restaurant tucked away in an unassuming little spot in an aesthetically sterile strip mall. Good, I say. Let the food speak for itself.  Well, this food won't shut up--and I mean that in a good way. In fact, it pretty much cups you by the jaw and screams in your face: \"I AM DELICIOUS. CONSUME AS MUCH OF ME AS YOU CAN!\" I had the brisket and it was perfect. Perfect amount of fat. Perfect crust from the dry rub on the outside. Perfect texture. Both the sweet and hot sauces are winners on their own, but I like to go half and half to make a sweet heat concoction. Next time I might just try the dry rub, though.   Their mac 'n cheese is very good, creamy with a little bit of gritty feel that I'm guessing comes from the fact that it's baked and has a little grated parm mixed in. The beans have some spice and an overall pleasing flavor. Cornbread was good, but honestly, it's pretty hard to screw up cornbread.  And, for dessert, a long john doughnut with maple frosting and...eek!...little morsels of bacon sitting nonchalantly on top. That speaks for itself.  Carnivores: Go eat here now! Vegetarians: Sucks to suck!"}
{"text":"This is Texas style BBQ and very delicious!! I had the 2 meat platter with sliced brisket and pulled pork. It and it was so good that  I took meat by the pound (Sliced Brisket, burnt ends, and pulled pork) back to a horse show group, and they couldn't stop talking about it. I look forward to going back. Oh and the macaroni and cheese is a good side"}
{"text":"The meat (any meat) is good. If you are going here for anything other than good barbq, you'll be disappointed. Their sales are meh, the corn muffins are bland, and all the other sides we tried were okay (nothing special). But... The meat! Damned good brisket, and the pork was superb. Just get there early so you don't miss out."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ in a simple setting that we would not of found without Yelp. The owner comes to your table seeking comments on the food and ensuring all enjoy their meal. Sauce is thinner than a standard sauce but extremely flavorful. Well worth the time it takes to find the place. A true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Tips:  $14 for a 2 meat platter (2 sides + corn muffin)  Meat choices: Chopped Brisket Ribs Sliced Turkey Chicken Hot Link etc.  2 Types of Cole Slaw: Creamy - traditional kind Carolina - a bit more tangy with a spicy kick to it  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Overall, I had a great experience and I would come again for some great tasting BBQ."}
{"text":"My family and I are from it of town staying with some friends. We found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out because of all the great reviews. It's located in a small strip mall and a little hidden behind a donut place but it's there! Super simple menu and options but because the aroma is so mesmerizing when you walk in I was overwhelmed because I wanted everything. I ended up getting a two meat platter with sliced brisket and pulled pork. For my two sides I chose Mac and cheese and veggie of the day which was garlic green beans. It also came with a mini corn muffin. Nothing disappointed my taste buds! Flavors were the perfect amount of smokiness and sweetness and melted in my mouth. I tried a little of all the sides-sweet, spicy, vinegar, and mustard. My favorite was the mustard sauce even though they said that one is more for poultry and sausages. I'm not even a big mustard fan but I thought it was pretty tasty. Finally, we ordered the banana whipped cream for dessert-my husband's request and in his opinion he said it was really good. Not too sugary or fake banana flavor. It was really fresh tasting. They also gifted us with a maple bacon donut which was so nice of them. The donut was the perfect sweet and savory combination for me.  And let me just tell you a little bit about the staff. Everyone in there had amazing customer service and I felt they genuinely were happy working there. Everyone seemed like they were all buddies in a backyard just having a get together. And I think that's pretty awesome.   I heard they were opening up another location that will be bigger and have alcohol so if you're in town or a local check it out. We are hoping they might want to head out to Southern California to open one out there!"}
{"text":"Seriously great barbecue!!!  The hot links are the bomb!  Service was very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This place is great.  When you walk in you can smell the smoked meat, in the good way.  They have great ice tea!  So I will be back.  Had the pulls pork.  No need for BBQ sauce.  Tastes great!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top 2 bbq places in Phoenix. We had the brisket, it like everything else comes unsauced. That speaks volumes to their quality, they don't hide behind the sauce. It was moist and tender and absolutely delicious. The owner related that he only uses USDA Prime beef. They have several sauces you can add yourself, and after trying them all I like the spicy one the best. We also sampled the pork. They shred it to order so it comes out juicy and fresh, and very flavorful. The owner also brought over a sample of the ribs. They had a wonderful smoke ring and were melt in your mouth tender. The bonus is everyone in there was very friendly and looked like they enjoy what they do, and it shows. The place was spotless although if you don't know it's there you will miss it. I'd drive 30 miles for this bbq!"}
{"text":"The barbecue was delicious. They're definitely one of the best places in town. My favorite is the beef brisket. They sure know how to make an excellent beef brisket. The only thing I don't like is the cashiers asking every time  about adding a tip on food to go. It's a little tacky.   I look forward to going back more in the future."}
{"text":"I have no complaints, everything was great and we will return. Especially loved the vinegar sauce since I avoid sugary bbq sauces. Tried the brisket, hot link, macaroni, green beans, baked beans, and the peach cobbler  My second visit we tried the turkey and it was SO GOOD, and also the Coleslaw was good as well"}
{"text":"A quick lunch  Noticed BBQ with good ratings nearby so felt the need...haven't had decent BBQ in awhile.   Service was great  Small dining area (or felt small during lunch lol) Had the 2 meat meal.  Brisket was delicious with good flavor Turkey was moist with good flavor (seldom can I find decent smoked turkey, a real treat) Mac n cheese was very good  Beans were quite bland in my opinion.  The little cornbread things (mini muffins) were dry but good flavor   Nothing needed sauce.. to me that's a good sign. (Sauce is available )  Big disappointment was the side cups and soda cups..styrofoam! Better options out there."}
{"text":"Won't come here again.. we came in and grabbed the pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Got some corn bread, beans and mac and cheese. The pulled pork was okay and the bun was cold and dry. The brisket was the only thing that was really good. The ribs were dry as well. Corn bread had a very bland taste and the mac and cheese was just under average. The strawberry Fanta was good! Anywho, we ate our food and the owner or manager comes up to us and asks us how our food was. My fiancé said eh, just okay. He was right! It was JUST OKAY NOTHING SPECIAL. So the person asks my fiancé what was not right about it. My fiancé says the ribs were a bit dry but the briskets were good. You could totally tell the manager or owner was annoyed. He continued his passive aggressive attitude and said well the meat is \"naked\" and to try some sauce.. then he became a bit more aggressive and offered free food. He kept asking us aggressively to take some meat home. My fiancé and I got a bit flustered and became uncomfortable at this point because he was just getting smart with us when my fiancé joked and said he doesn't eat pork. Next time when you ask someone how the food was and we give you our honest opinion please be sure that you can handle it and not get upset. Passive aggressiveness is not appreciated. Also, the staff was a bit slow when asking them questions. It was our first time and definitely our last."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for lunch after reading some of the reviews on Yelp. After we ate there we talked about whether we would tell people about it or keep it to ourselves. It was so delicious we know if people find it, there will be a line out the door. But it's so good we want them to grow and hopefully be able to stay open for dinner so we can keep eating here for years.  I had the brisket sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese and the boyfriend had the pulled pork with corn muffins. We were blown away with how perfectly delicious everything was. They give you your sandwich without sauce, and it's awesome enough you don't need it, but they have a spicy and sweet sauce station to make it nice and messy. I mixed the spicy and sweet sauces together and poured it all over the brisket. The textures were perfect, soft, tender, meaty and unbelievable.  It was worth every penny and we've already added $80 in the monthly budget to eat this every Saturday."}
{"text":"Definitely the best bbq in Phoenix! Great ribs, brisket, Mac n cheese, broccoli, and beans! We loved it all!"}
{"text":"Meat coma version 2.0.   Finally an alternative to Lil Miss, I feel he has Scott beat by just the thinnest slice of brisket. I had turkey, brisket and pulled pork over two visits and man was I happy. My persistence was rewarded with a taste of pork belly that he'd just pulled from the cooker. Never have I had a better bbq experience. Quick and friendly service with plenty of seating. Delicious affordable bbq. You will not be disappointed. The pulled pork sandwich was a generous portion as well."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, professional establishment. I loved the mac n cheese, watermelon ice tea, and the vinegar sauce! The brisket was very good and the pork ribs were decent. The ribs from Phil's BBQ in San Diego have me spoiled, so I now unfortunately compare ribs to Phil's. The ribs here are pretty good, but they don't compair to Phil's. Still, I will be back for the mac n cheese and to try the other meats! Rating = B"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ joint. Family on vacation from NY and visited original location last year, decided to come to new location this year. Was not disappointed!  Pulled meats, sausages, sides...all nicely done. Make sure you get their pickles!  Great BBQ reasonably priced.  Servers are personable and helpful.  Down home BBQ joint worth a visit, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Naked is seriously one of the best! Had the two meat plate with brisket and pulled pork! The meat was excellent! For the sides, I had the Mac and cheese and potato salad! Both were delicious! Oh, and don't forget to get a maple bacon donut! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I thought it was going to be a gimmick with the chipotle-style line & service, I was definitely wrong. Ribs & Brisket were amazing, as good if not better than Bootleggers in Old Town. Nice choice of entrees and sides, reasonable prices, good portions."}
{"text":"Okay I have pretty much tried the entire menu. It's all good this is REAL Barbecue and yes its amazing naked with no sauce all of it and the quality has stayed the same. They do good bbq."}
{"text":"The owner came over to check on my meal.  We got to talking and he brought me a couple of samples of meat that I didn't order.  They were just as delicious as the ribs I was eating.  Really nice guy and great food.  The homemade pickles and marinated onions were a great touch, and a big step up from the fluorescent green pickles I get at the other BBQ places.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ best so far in Phoenix by a long shot Fantastic vinegar sauce. Oren was very gracious  Definitely recommend. Will be back"}
{"text":"We were actually in the parking lot headed for some Banh Mi when the wood aroma hit us and we decided some 'que might be good. I went brisket platter with mac-n-cheese and beans. She went pork on pork which was their daily special sandwich - pulled pork topped with sliced pork belly. The meat was fall apart tender and had a nice smoke ring. It's naked - so you can add your own sauce if u like. I used a bit of the mustard based sauce and it was good. The spicy sauce wasn't really that spicy but apparently it went well with the pork with the dry seasoning added. The beans were good, the slaw was a bit too creamy and the mac wasn't anything to write home about. Overall, go for the meats which are delish. Also, the homemade pickles and pickled onions were a nice touch too! 4.25 stars"}
{"text":"I've had Naked bookmarked for awhile now and am just getting around to trying it.  The concept is very simple and similar to another BBQ place I go to that will remain nameless.  We were greeted by the staff and walked through the menu choices and even offered a sample.  I decided on the one meat platter with two sides.  My meat was the hot link ( the not so spicy one ) Mac and cheese and cole slaw for my sides. A really cool add on are their homemade pickles you can have or not at no extra charge. They have two choices of BBQ sauce that we thought would be hot ( temperature) since it was in a heated container but it was luke warm. The food is on a tray which is not my favorite but it's a BBQ place so that's the trend lately. The food was really good. The hot link was as described.  The mac and cheese was really good. Not everyone can get it right but I must say this was a favorite. The cole slaw was good too and again not everyone can make a good cole slaw. My overall impression was bravo for good food and great customer service. All pluses from this yelper. See you again soon."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. I ordered the two meat plate $15, but the portions were small and definitely NOT worth $15. I ended up with ribs and sliced brisket. The meat was Smokey but no thick smoke line on the brisket. Ribs were tender but too many baby bones. They have 4 varieties of bbq sauce I ended up liking the spicy sauce. I gave them a 3 based on portion size, flavor and customer service. I guess I'm just used to slow cooked bbq on a real pit not indoor smoker and a thick smoke line with some crust.  My sides were their garlic green beans. Eh okay  Mac-n-cheese were okay but I make better."}
{"text":"The gentrification of BBQ continues in N. Scottsdale with Naked BBQ.  First, let me get the good out of the way. The kids who got my order were nice, and the restaurant was clean.   When it came to the food, this was one of the worst bbq experiences of my life, and I've ate A LOT of bbq having lived all over the Midwest and south.   The ribs were tiny, didn't fall off the bone, had almost no flavor. The hot links tasted store bought, and the brisket although not dry, had no smokiness to it. None of their meats had a good smoke ring, and the sides were inedible. I literally took a few small bites of the potato salad and beans and threw them into the garbage.   But this is what I should of expected from a bbq place that is run closer to a chipotle then a tried and true bbq joint where smoking meats is an art, and the pit master is revered.  With Naked and Dickey's the gentrification of BBQ has reached a point where you will wonder if bbq will ever be good on this side of town, I guess only time will tell."}
{"text":"Over the weekend, had a hankering for some BBQ and decided to give this place a go!    Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix along W Bell Road in the same compound as Caramba, and behind Lamar's Donuts.  If you're not paying attention, you can easily miss the restaurant as it's situated all the way in the back behind Lamar's Donuts.  Thankfully, using our trusty GPS, it told us we arrived.  (-0.25) Parking was plentiful at the side of the restaurant as I thought I spied several parking spaces there.  Parking directly in front of the restaurant has 1-hour wait signs as the restaurant has businesses to the left of it, so if you plan on staying longer, I'd suggest parking at the side.   There were a couple of tables and chairs outside though there wasn't any barrier and offered no privacy from the passing cars and parking lot. (-0.25) The restaurant was well lit; tables/chairs very clean; and floors were equally clean as well.  Noise level wasn't bad. The place was on the small size and felt a bit cramped to me.  If you came with a large party, I guess you could place a couple of tables and chairs together.  (-0.50)  Menus - self-explanatory, and posted right above the serving area as you entered.      Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  Any questions we had were answered politely and promptly.  We were even offered samples to try prior to ordering.   I never heard about Carolina slaw (on the menu) and wanted to try it.  Thankfully the staff asked if I'd like to taste it because it's definitely an acquired taste, and it most definitely was!  Very tangy - I guess it's made with vinegar.  Suffice it to say, it was too strong for me and had to pass.  I know...I know...what kind of wuss comes to eat meat and can't handle some vinegar, right?!  Food - My party and I ordered the two-meat platter - two meats, two sides, and a corn muffin.  I had the pulled pork, ribs (I believe they gave me 4), beans, and the creamy coleslaw.   Staff will also ask if you want pickles at the side which amounts to about 4-5 thinly sliced pickles. The pickles weren't tangy but actually sweet, and not too soggy.   The creamy coleslaw was very tasty, fresh, creamy, and not swimming in water.   The beans had a chili taste to it, and was warm and very well seasoned!   The corn muffin unusually had corn baked within it.  This is something I never had and, though unusual, I must say I really liked it.  The corn muffin wasn't too dry, but actually moist. The pulled pork was very moist, tender, and well cooked in the slow cooker!  The ribs too were of the fall-off-the-bone type.  Moist, not too dry, well cooked and well rubbed with their seasonings as well. The ribs and pulled pork was cooked so well that it didn't require any sauces, but for the purposes of this review, I tried the available sauces (by the soda machine) - sweet and spicy.  There were other sauces available for customers.  Both sauces were delicious and the latter wasn't all that spicy in my opinion, though it provided a tiny kick.  Definitely would recommend, and also definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again today and got the pulled pork sandwich. I asked for a gluten free bun and was very happy that they could accommodate me with that request. It's very thoughtful and considerate of the owner to offer gluten free buns. He came around to ask how the meal was, he really does care about customer service. The food was great and I love the spicy bbq sauce, got a lil kick to it, that's just perfect."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint!  I especially like their hot links and their brisket.  Kids like the mac.  I highly recommend to satisfy a BBQ fix."}
{"text":"We brought home carry-out entrees & were all pleased and impressed with our dinners. Everything tastes like authentic \"handed down family recipes.\" I chose the pulled pork platter (pictured) that has very tender pork and their delicious sauce on the side, which comes in either sweet or spicy. They will give you plenty of extra containers or you can fill them by the soda fountain. Their sauce is so good that they even sell it. I love the sweet version, but it is not too sweet. The slaw comes in creamy or Carolina. I had the creamy, and It has the mayonnaise not \"sweet poppyseed\" dressing. The baked beans are interesting. They are made with different types of beans and there are a lot of them. They have a smokey, slightly hot spicy sauce. The tiny little corn muffins are delicious, have kernels of corn mixed in the batter, and again are not the sweet kind but have rather a \"southern home cooked\" taste. The macaroni and cheese is creamy and delicious; interestingly they add fresh cracked pepper, so you taste that as well. The hot links (pictured) come in regular and hot. The hot are hot; they get hotter as you're eating, and those little corn muffins come in pretty handy. Haha The prices are very reasonable! (See photos of menu.)"}
{"text":"Good BBQ sandwich and nice service! Stopped in for lunch. Ordered the brisket sandwich with side of macaroni and cheese.  The young lady at the counter took the order, brought it out when ready and cleaned the table when finished - all excellent!!!!!  Both sandwich and Mac and cheese above average."}
{"text":"Let's start with the side veggies; today green beans in garlic and terrific. Next the slaw; regular and very vinegary Carolina. We went coastal south, which was a perfect offset to the richness of the fine pulled pork and wonderfully seasoned brisket. That edge seasoning tasted like the best pastrami. The small corn muffins have a bit of cheese to add creaminess and niblets for texture. The pickles  and onions are another fine touch. This place does a good business so try to get there before the rush. On the other hand the line works quickly and are friendly."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Naked BBQ for months and I finally had the chance to try it and it did not disappoint.   To start, as I walked in the restaurant the amazing BBQ smell hits me so I was excited to try all the fantastic meat. I ended up trying their chopped Brisket and Ribs and both were delicious and tender.  I also tried both their sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and if you like spicy the sauce will not disappoint.  They also provide a pretty good portion of meat.  I have been to some BBQ restaurants and they are not as kind with their meat portions.   I guess my only negative for Naked BBQ is the time it closes during the weekday. They close at 4pm so unfortunately I can never grab BBQ after work."}
{"text":"Brisket was moist and melt in your mouth fantastic and add the spicy home made BBQ sauce and your good to go. Also they have a maple bacon donut that will delight your salty & sweet taste buds."}
{"text":"Went there again tonight to try other things.  Seating was not an issue this time (I think they are probably most busy at lunch - so no seating means they have good food).  The pulled pork was absolutely amazing (again) - the bark is by far the best part.  Also tried the chicken, brisket, links, ribs, and other sides.  All were amazing.  The chicken was moist.  The brisket was very flavorful.  My kids loved the ribs.  Links were really good as well.  Mac & cheese was good.  Collard greens tasted like collard greens should taste.  Pickles & onions were to die for.  Beans were slightly spicy and very good.  My prior assessment of the cole slaw remains - it is bland (maybe some celery seeds and a bit more salt & pepper would be good?)  The cornbread muffins were - well - my kids ate them so quickly, that I only had 1 bite.  Maple bacon donuts were scrumptious.  I prefer the sweet sauce to the spicy sauce, but the spicy is also very good.  Overall the place was clean.  The owner is super nice.  Finally, an excellent BBQ place on the NW side of Phoenix.  We will be back many, many times."}
{"text":"Found this little gem thanks to Yelp. My hubby ordered the Pull Pork sandwich it was delicious. I ordered the ribs, they were so good we ordered more! We arrived during the lunch hour rush, service was fast."}
{"text":"After swearing to myself I wouldn't waste my time at Dickey's anymore, I've been on the hunt for a new BBQ place close to work. I've found it!  Upon walking in, we were greeted by a nice guy behind the counter. You can get sandwiches which come with one side, one or two meat platters which come with two sides and cornbread, or a salad. They also have meat by the pound. I got a pulled pork platter with creamy slaw and Mac n cheese but they also have brisket, chicken, turkey, etc. They also have pickles upon request.   They serve you all meat naked (get it??) but have four sauces you can select from near the drink station. Sweet, spicy, vinegar and mustard sauce. I grabbed some sweet and mustard sauce and off I went.   The pulled pork was awesome! And it's always nice to self apply all of your sauce to your liking. The Mac n cheese wasn't any basic kraft kind either, it tasted homemade and delicious. The creamy slaw was excellent as well. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread, but the corn flavor was more apparent than other kinds I've tried, so I assume that's a plus.  For 11 dollars I left very full and very happy.   The employees were friendly and checked on people as they ate to make sure they enjoyed their food. We ate inside and left only mildly smelling like BBQ, another plus. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The meat is really good.  But sides are all bland.  I would go back if I was craving BBQ food, but only to eat shredded chicken or pork, not the sides."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family. Quality food and service. The smell of the in-house barbecuing really sets it apart from other places.  Really nice staff. Also really like the whole idea of \"Naked\" meats so you know they work on the taste of the meat not just the sauce. Carolina slaw was different and delicious. Overall enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Great food! The sauces are delicious. I really enjoyed The sweet tea they had.  The atmosphere is fun and welcoming. It's neat to see what people have written on the wall."}
{"text":"Had the brisket and pulled pork platter w/Mac and cheese. It was awesome. Fantastic food."}
{"text":"Not impressed ketchup based sauce. Pricey for Portion at lunch. Mac m cheese not cheesy and I had to ask for tobasco. No wet wipes for your hands and watermelon iced tea was artificial flavors"}
{"text":"One of my favorite BBQ places,  you must try the beef brisket but have them slice it for you.  The literally melts in your mouth.  I got the Macaroni and Cheese with Cole Slaw for my sides, to be honest with you I ate so much of the meat didn't have much room for my side, but they were delicious the small portion I ate.   The service is amazing, always friendly. Location; right off Bell and I17  Restaurant;  Small inside and clean. Must try, check hours"}
{"text":"I like the barbeque brisket here. The meat is smoked and the sides are delicious. I like that they have a lot of sides to pick from.  Plus, I like the pickled onions and pickles. They have some nice barbecue sauces. Hopefully, there is one you will find that you like.  Also, they usually are open later in the day on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Mother said don't talk with your mouth full.  Too Bad! This Brisket is AWESOME!!  Melts in your mouth. The sides are fabulous and the staff makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Brisket. Brisket. Brisket.  Definitely the best I've tried in this area. I only love the brisket even more when I put the vinegar sauce they have on it.   I definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great BBQ. Also, the staff is very friendly and I can't remember one time that Oren hasn't come around to ask how our meal is going."}
{"text":"OMG! This is the best BBQ! The pickles and onions were delish  too!! Mac and cheese and cornbread muffin so moist and tasty! GO...you won't be disappointed!! This is my new go to BBQ place!! #getnaked #bombdiggtybbq #getnakedandthrowdown #YUM"}
{"text":"4 stars for now but definitely a 5 star possibility!  This place is right near where I work.  I had driven by it a few weeks ago and saw that the grand opening was near the end of January.  I decided that today was the day that I would try it out.  Me and my buddy Will from work hopped in my car and drove over here to sample some BBQ.  Plenty of parking outside and we walked in and there was nobody in line.  The place was packed though...all the seating was full.  Good sign!  The first thing I noticed was the little line/partition of wood.  Pretty cool set up and it also shows that this is true BBQ and its smoked low and slow with that same wood!  The place smelled great.  I surveyed the menu really quick and decided on a 2 meat plate.  I went with brisket and pulled pork, mac and cheese and cole slaw as my sides.  This also came with a little cornbread muffin.  They sliced up my brisket, scooped out my pork, boiled my macaroni and dished out my cole slaw.  They packaged it all up, paid and took it to go.  Here is how everything was...............  2 Meat Plate ($14.00)  Brisket-  They give you the option for chopped or sliced brisket.  I chose sliced.  There was not a fatty or lean option so I was not sure what was coming.  Thankfully it was a little mix of both.  It was fall apart tender, smoked proper and pretty delicious.  It was a decent sized portion of it too.  I was impressed.  Not the best I have ever had, but definitely up there and super legit.  No sauce needed.  Pulled Pork-  This was my second choice of meat.  It was seasoned well, moist and tasty.  No sauce needed for this stuff either.  The portion was just a tad skimp compared to the brisket, plus it was the last of it remaining in the container, so maybe it could have even been better?  It was darn good as is though...that has to say something, right?  Mac and Cheese-  When they lifted up the lid of the sides, I saw a vat of what looked like bright yellowish cheese.  It didn't look too appealing at first but then I saw some magic happen.  They actually make each order of mac and cheese on the spot and cook it to order.  They have some noodles in a colander, they boil those to cook them, then transfer them into the vat of cheese and coat them up.  This mac and cheese was legit!  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce they use was very good.  This is a definite must order side from here on out.  The portion was pretty large too.  I love the fact that they use textured spiral noodles too.  It lets the cheese stick to it pretty well! Overall, a great side.  Carolina Cole Slaw-  You have your choice of Carolina (vinegar) or Creamy (mayo) slaw.  I chose the Carolina style.  It was just ok.  It could have used more vinegar or apple cider or whatever they use.  It was kind of bland.  Not bad in any sense, just could have been more kicked up.  I would probably skip it next time and do double mac and cheese.    Cornbread Muffin- Meh.  It wasn't that good.  It had chunks of corn in it which is not my style.  Tasted a little stale too.  Definitely wouldn't pay for one..it came with the plate though.  Overall, I was impressed!  For just over $15.00, you get probably 8-10 ounces of meat (at least) and 2 large sides.  The meat is legit, smoked,  REAL BBQ and the mac and cheese was really good.  I will definitely be back to try out some of their other meats like their ribs and sausage.  The fact that this place had no line at all around 12:20 was awesome too!  I'm sure that will change once word of mouth gets around on how good this place is, but until then, if you need to get some legit BBQ in Deer Valley, this is the spot.  As far as the Phoenix BBQ I have had, this place is way better than Pork on a Fork and just a tad under Little Miss BBQ.  Definitely can't complain though.  This place is legit!"}
{"text":"The bbq brisket and ribs were excellent.  The beans and potato salad had good flavor as well.   We will be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh.  Decent cook on the BBQ but sauces weren't that memorable.   Uncooked russet potato salad was bland and half raw pasta in a bland mac and cheese sauce.  Famous Dave's does better but it could be worse."}
{"text":"Wow! Happy to have found this place on my way to Portillo's. I was craving something new so I decided to try Naked BBQ. The first thing I noticed was the clean, relaxed and inviting atmosphere. It's a fast casual / Chipotle style line where your food gets plated in front of the customer. I mentioned it was my first time and the gentleman behind the counter recommended the current special: pulled pork sandwich and a side for $5. I thought that sounded like a great deal and ended up getting some ribs as well. All of this great food was under $10, which I greatly appreciate. I will come back, but I will make sure to get the sweet, creamy slaw to put on my pulled pork sandwich. One of the employees gave me a sample and it is a winning combination with the pork."}
{"text":"jim dandy yum.  Had the brisket and pulled pork platter with mac and cheese and beans.  The meats were nice and smokey, the spicy sauce was good.  The sides were hot.  Mac & Cheese was great and cheesy.  The bbq beans were delicious.  Maybe they will add turkey legs besides the turkey breast!  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Had take out for dinner. The brisket was very moist and a nice smoke flavor. The sausage was very greasy but had a good spicy flavor. The potato salad had  chunks of egg, which we like, and was ok but lacked flavor.   It's very pricey for take out BBQ, 20.99/pound for the brisket.  We won't go very often at those prices."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!!! Food is phenomenal!!! The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. If it's your first time, order the brisket sandwich. It's absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love BBQ but I have food allergies so I have to be cautious when dining out.  The great part about Naked BBQ is that they make their own sauces from scratch and know what is in their product.  Great service and awesome food!  Today I had the pulled chicken and potato salad, which reminds me of my Grandmas kitchen.  The owner came to our table, Oren and you can tell that pride is in everything they do.  Yum on every Naked level!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good bbq spot here it is. Best bbq in town hands down. Go there at least 2-3 times a week. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The brisket was just okay. It was very greasy, the bottom of my to go box was full of oil. I got the southwestern corn(veggie of the day) there was nothing southwestern about it at all. The mac and cheese was okay, nothing to sing about. Don't get me wrong it wasn't horrible, just not a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"I'd rate Naked BBQ at 4.5 stars.  Friendly staff was very helpful.  Efficient service and clean dining room.  Also clean dining room.  Sliced brisket platter had excellent beef with great smoke taste.  Beans had unusual spicing; perhaps rub?  Somewhere between traditional baked beans and chili.  Would get different side next time.  Mac and cheese was very good.  Corn muffin small but good."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQs in the Phoenix area. It's just a small joint in a strip mall with no atmospere at all, unless you count that warm wonderful smoky aroma that puts everyone under their spell! We drove by it many times until one day decided to try it.  Brisket is my favorite and theirs is EXCELLENT. Smoke cooked with the authentic pink stripe below the crust. Also very good Pulled Pork and several strong sides including the Mac and Cheese. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is super clean, easy going, food is delicious and service great! I got a 2 meat platter with brisket and a chicken breast. Also, beans n mac as sides. I thought it was all above average. The beans are very unique and have a great flavor. The brisket was melt in your mouth good. Happy to have a new spot to eat!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Tried the pulled pork and it was moist and flavorful. I appreciate that there's some choices if you want to make it healthier with the sides with a vinegar based coleslaw and daily veggie. My personal gripes were that my serving had quite a bit of fat chunks and the cornbread has a weird consistency, it was really chewy and not the kind of buttery, crumbly delicious-ness I've come to expect with cornbread. Still- really enjoyed my to-go meal."}
{"text":"I can't think of many bbq places in the valley that compare. So glad this place is right in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today around 12:45.  Place was busy and a short line to wait in to order at the counter.  Ordered a 1 item platter with 2 sides and a cornbread muffin for $11.00.  I ordered the sliced brisket with side of Mac N Cheese and Carolina Slaw.  The good news is the brisket was amazing - well smoked and full of flavor, so good in fact it hardly needed the side of spicy BBQ sauce.  The Mac N Cheese was also delish! Velvety smooth sauce with lots of cheese flavor.  The cornbread muffin was forgettable, a tiny nugget of bland corn meal...  however this pales in comparison to the Carolina Slaw.  I do understand that Carolina Slaw is vinegar based but this styrofoam cup of Slaw was literally drowning in vinegar.  Inedible after a single forkful.  It was like swallowing a spoonful of straight apple cider vinegar - not pleasant at all.  Hopefully that recipe is corrected.  Otherwise would have been a 4 star review."}
{"text":"I went here during lunch time on a Tuesday. No wait at all but the place was full of diners eating at the tables.   I order a mixed plate (enough food to share) that included the ribs and brisket. The brisket is pulled and very moist. The ribs were falling off the bone, well seasoned and also very moist. You can choose to grab a bbq sauce to go with your entree after you order at the side of the counter.  I chose the sweet and tangy one but also got the spicy for my friend that I was sharing with. I don't think the spicy is even close to being hot. The actual sides I had were Mac and cheese and both cole slaws. You also get mini corn muffins. To be honest the sides were not that great and all could use a lot more flavor. The muffins were tasty and next time I would ask for butter. They aren't as cheesy as they claim. I would go back just to have the bbq meat itself and muffins :)  The staff was very friendly and I'd recommend this place if you are looking for a quick bite of bbq! Pricing is moderate for the plate I got and the extra side it was $17."}
{"text":"I'm giving Naked Q 5 stars for the outstanding customer service, incredible proteins (went with family and we all ordered different smoked meats to share) and very large portions.     I would suggest tweaking the side dishes:  - baked beans instead of chili-style - Mac and cheese; thought it was heavy - creamy Cole slaw could use a bit more \"creaminess\"  All in all, a great find...will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"best BBQ I've had in Phoenix. I ordered the ribs and chopped brisket which was seasoned perfectly. I prefer my sauce cooked with the meat but they offer spicy and sweet BBQ sauce to use. You get two sides with the platter and I got the mac n cheese & baked beans. Mac n cheese was meh and the baked beans are more like chili beans which I wasn't expecting but necessarily mad at. I will def come back and maybe try different sides. Customer service is good. They're knowledgeable of the portion sizes and offer samples of the sides if you're unsure. I also got the peach cobbler for dessert and it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ - super clean, friendly staff and yummy meats not drowned in sauce but so flavorful on their own. Ribs, brisket, pulled chicken all winners!"}
{"text":"We've been twice and each time the food is delicious, the workers are so friendly and the price is right! My husband and I split the 2 entree plate and it's the perfect amount of food for us! I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Got an order to go today.  The flavor and texture of the ribs and brisket was fantastic - perfectly done.  The sauce on the side was good, but a little sweet for my taste.  Apparently they have a few different sauces and I'll try a different one next time."}
{"text":"This place was light weight amazing from CS to the food!!!! I smelled the mesquite so I stopped, the greeting from the host was warm and friendly... I ordered the 2 meat combo with a side of Mac.... the brisket was hands down some of the best in the valley and the ribs on the bone stayed on the bone just how I love them, sauce was a option not a necessity, in which I tried and it was on point, vinegar based and all good!!! Then they have these little tin peach cobblers they were good not great however very affordable and served its purpose!!!! I highly recommend this place and would put there Q up against anybody in the Valley!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The brisket here is delicious!! By far the best brisket that I have had anywhere. It is soo good that I haven't tried any options of the meats. It is so juicy and it melts in your mouth. A lb of it has run me between $15-18. The carolina slaw is a vinegar cole slaw that i tried. It is way too spicy for me, I could only eat 2 bites and my nose was running. I love the simple decor inside and staff has always been very nice."}
{"text":"Wow. I was so blown away by the flavor in the brisket. incredible. I never knew meat could be so euphoric. I kept hearing this place was amazing and I am sooooo glad I stopped here. The only problem now is I won't ever be able to pass it without stopping!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had. I haven't even tried their sauce because the meat is just so good without it, I don't want to ruin it! I cannot wait to go back! The customer service is phenomenal as well. I am so happy to have a place that doesn't cook their food in BBQ sauce because my husband doesn't like it! It's nice to have a place we can both enjoy! I cannot stress how much I enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"After much anticipation we are SO excited to have Naked in the neighborhood!! It tastes just like the original! We have been long time fans and could not wait for them to open down the street! This location is beautiful and the food is just as great of quality and taste. Still hands down the best brisket I've ever had!! It's going to be hard not to eat here every day with it being so close!"}
{"text":"Loved the pulled pork sandwich here! Great food and service and our food arrived very quickly despite the place being steadily busy. The cornbread muffin order was actually three mini muffins which makes it easy to share. Only critique was the level of heat for the hot sauce, could have been a little higher."}
{"text":"In town visiting; and I decided to check out this place based on the awesome Yelp reviews. I got the brisket, mac n cheese with potato salad. The brisket was like butter and among the best I've ever had.  As we left the owner was making his rounds asking all customers how their meal was, etc. He made sure to greet every single person. GREAT customer service!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We grew up eating Texas BBQ.  We've spent the last two years looking for BBQ that reminds us of home.   We finally found it!  Brisket was ridiculous! The sausage and pork were awesome too!  Thanks for what you're doing here!  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Very skeptical coming into this place, nobody here when it was being opened. But I'm sure glad we were here first!The owner offered us some burnt ends and we also got the best cuts of brisket I've seen in the area besides pork on a fork.   Super happy with the quality of the brisket. I have been back 3 times since and I can honestly say it has not been a consistent experience. Brisket has definitely been hit or miss for me. It's amazing most of the time but I've had some pretty flavorless dry pieces as well. I will still continue to support this place and it's potential!  I have yet to try the everything but will edit my review when I do!   The place is also super clean and friendly, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The brisket will change your life, pure and simple. Everyone we interacted with was incredible. They explained the food and their process and went out of their way to make us a platter with everything we like. The naked philosophy is no joke either, the meat stands all by itself absolutely delicious. They also have in house sauces to put it over the top good. Everything down to the amazing house made pickles was fantastic. We finally found a bbq spot!"}
{"text":"Right from the time you walk in the staff are friendly and helpful . You can get a little sample of what you would like to try . The brisket was moist and flavorful , pulled pork was excellent . Coleslaw was perfect , mac and cheese was a tad dry but nothing to take away a star for . I will be returning and telling everyone about this little gem . I would definitely enjoy seeing a family owned barbeque place flourish in north Phoenix , especially one with this kind of customr service ."}
{"text":"New barbecue joint that opened up in the neighborhood. Much needed up in this area. Only a couple barbecue places for miles. These guys do a good job on smoking their meats. Only have two variety of sauces which are sweet and spicy. Both are good but would like a little more kick to the spicy one. I got the two meat combo with ribs and brisket and two sides for $15. The brisket had a nice black and crust and was juicy. Their ribs were cooked very nicely with a good dry rib on them. They were meaty and tender. Will be going back to check out some of their other meats."}
{"text":"The outside looks okay, nothing special. Parking was easy. Tried the 2 meat platter with pulled pork and sliced brisket along with mac and cheese and creamy slaw as my sides. Also ordered 2 ribs and had a chocolate chip cookie. I tried both the sweet and the spicy sauces. The pulled pork was very good and was my favorite of the meats that I tried. Next came the ribs and last was the brisket. I found the brisket to be a little on the dry side. The sauces were good but too similar in flavor. I would have liked for them to be more unique from each other. I preferred the spicy sauce. Didn't like the cole slaw at all it was kind of runny (not creamy) and didn't have a lot of flavor. The mac and cheese was good. The big chocolate chip cookie was delish."}
{"text":"I wouldn't be surprised to see these guys become a chain if they are so inclined.  It is that good and that cool of a concept. I will be able to say I ate at location #00001.  The 'cue, the donuts, the sweet tea.  It's all fantastic."}
{"text":"Yuh me! I definitely enjoyed my experience at Naked BBQ. On this visit, I tried the 2 meat platter of brisket and pulled pork with sides of cole slaw and mac and cheese. The meat was melt in your mouth good and the flavors were perfect. I preferred the brisket over the pulled pork just because I liked how it was seasoned. The platter also came with a corn bread which was good and some homemade pickles which I loved.   The sauces that were available added a nice touch to the meat, although I didn't sense too much of a difference between the sweet and the spicy sauces. I think I should go back and try them again ;)"}
{"text":"I was about to pay my first visit to them on Bell Road, but was pleased to discover their newly opened store here in Scottsdale!  The 5 star review is strictly based on the Brisket and Ribs.  I have not yet tried any of the other meats, and I wasn't very fond of the sides that I tried.  More on the sides in a moment.    I ordered a two meat platter.  The ribs were perfectly cooked, very tasty, and not sauced (which is how I prefer them).  They were delicious, and even better when I warmed up my leftover ribs the next day.  The brisket, which I requested fatty and sliced with some bark on it, was the best I've had here in Arizona.  It was moist, flavorful, had nice texture and was delicious although the bark was a bit on the salty side from the course salt that they seasoned it with before cooking.  I hadn't had brisket that good since back when I lived in Texas.  The meat was definitely 5 stars, and I can't wait to go back to try the other meats.  I know that folks taste in BBQ sauce is a matter of personal preference.  To be honest, I couldn't really tell the difference between Naked's sweet sauce and the spicy sauce, and I didn't care for either of them - but I am one of those people who has pretty specific sauce preferences.  Both sauces were too sweet for me, so I just left them off.  The meat was good enough to stand on its own any day.  The ribs were only warm, and the brisket was about room temperature but that didn't make a difference to me.  Now, the sides... The cornbread muffin was just ok.  The mac & cheese was better than a lot of places, but it was not warm enough.  I was glad that green beans (seasonal vegetable varies) were available as a healthy option, but I didn't care for whatever seasoning they used on them and they too were not warm.  Since I didn't go for the sides, I'm sticking to 5 stars for Naked BBQ and will plan on just enjoying the meat there next time.  I did love the watermelon iced tea!    Their prices seemed a bit on the hgh side, but given the quality of the BBQ, I will gladly spend my money to eat here in the future!  I should mention that service was fast, helpful and friendly.  As I ate the owner and another individual (manager?) stopped by my table to say hello and make sure my food was ok.  A couple of notes:  They do sell out of items on busy days, and sliced brisket is not available in sandwiches, only chopped."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome this is what a barbecue place to look like this is what a barbecue place should taste like.  The owners and the associates are down to earth it's very clean place, I was blown away by how tasty they are brisket or pork their chicken in there Sausage links were.  I consider myself a decent barbecue smoker but their brisket blew mine out of the water that's for sure this place is going to be getting packed in no time because of how tasty their food is."}
{"text":"Went on the day they opened for lunch.  By the time I arrived they were already out of a couple of items (understandable, it was busy!).  The line moved well and the employees were friendly and attentive.  Spent around $50 on 4 sandwiches, a little pricey for the amount of food received, but food quality was good.  Being that my career and living are derived from customer service, the only thing I found a bit strange was that the person I presumed to be the proprietor or senior manager because of his attire and the fact he had been behind the counter, looked me straight in the eye as I walked out of the place with two bags of food and never even acknowledged me.  Not a thank you, a smile, or anything at all.  Just sat at the table by the door and stared.  Didn't leave me with a warm fuzzy, I can't wait to come back feeling."}
{"text":"Brisket 10/10 Pulled pork 9/10 Baked beans 6/10 Mac n cheese 7/10 Corn bread 8/10 Cleanliness 9/10 Service 10/10"}
{"text":"Went in today and ordered the two meat platter (pulled pork & sausage) and two sides (potato salad & BBQ beans.  $14 seemed a bit high for what we get, but BBQ is never cheap. The beans tasted good, but were a bit raw,  No big deal.  The potato salad is good, but could use some spicing up.  The pulled pork and sausage was good, but didn't have much of a BBQ flavor.  You need to put their BBQ sauce on the perk it up,  the sauce is a bit thin and too sweet.  Before you order the mac & Cheese look at the pictures on yelp--I didn't try it, but one look and I don't want to....Service is excellent however.  I will stop by again if in the area, but I think these 5 star reviews are a bit much.  I have learned to ignore 5 & 1 star reviews anyway.  The 2/3/4  star reviews are the ones that usually  tell the truth."}
{"text":"I went to the Scottsdale location:  I give one star; Anyone who says this place is \"AWESOME\" doesn't know what Bar-B-Q is.  There is no smoke flavoring AT ALL!! The meat taste like it has been boiled, the potatoes in the salad were under cooked, the sauce is just sweet, and nothing I ate had any flavor in it at all!!  The only thing I enjoyed was the pickled onions (Correction: this was the only food with flavor).  If you are going to serve \"Naked\" bar-b-q then there better be some kind of flavor in the meat and there wasn't.  Those who state the \"smell\" of bar-b-q is in the air are lying!  Terrible place to eat at, DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"Finally a great BBQ restaurant in the area. The ribs are super delicious, the brisket super yummy, yet best of all is the people behind the counter. We love this place!"}
{"text":"WOW!! i'm skeptical on trying new BBQ places.  and my fiancee, all people who really doesn't prefer bar be que to eat picks Naked BBQ.  so we walk in on a Monday late afternoon.  They close at 4pm Monday thru Thursday or until they run out of food. But after we got our meals,sat down, and started eating, I told the owner he has my business!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best brisket I've had since leaving the Southeast. While I would love to see more choices in the bbq sauce, the options available were very good.  I need better banana (more bananas) pudding if you tell me it's homemade.  I'll definitely be back for seconds. Great experience."}
{"text":"we got a huge platter for a tailgate, and pretty sure they gave us extra amounts because it was so much food. We got brisket and pulled pork, and macaroni, potato salad, beans and cornbread for the sides. The sides were so good and the beans had actual meat in them which was awesome.  The owner was super nice and helpful, and the food was so good! Definitely the best bbq on the west coast. Thanks Naked BBQ for making our tailgate extra special :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the two-meat platter with both types of meat being brisket.  The food tasted good but it was not anything amazing and the price doesn't really reflect that or the quantity.  The service was great.  I will return sometime, either when I am really craving brisket or they send out coupons."}
{"text":"Best brisket I've had outside of Texas or Memphis!   Been there weekly since they opened.  Sometimes I get the sandwich with chopped brisket, sometimes the single meat sliced brisket.  With the sliced meat you can request lean or fattier, both taste great.    I like the coleslaw or green beans and potato salad or mac and cheese for sides.    The sauces are OK, the hotter sauce is my choice.  The mustard sauce is good for a change of pace. The cornbread is OK, but wish it came with some butter.  The pickled onions are good, they just need to serve more of them.  I'm really happy they opened here, we needed a good barbecue place.  I'm a supporter."}
{"text":"Happy to have this place in the neighborhood and right off the 101 and Shea Blvd. The in-house smoked meats smell awesome upon entering and there is a nice range of prices depending on what you order. Meals are served on paper covered, 12 x 8-inch or so aluminum trays. The sides are very large and meat servings are ample. I really liked the spicy bbq sauce, but the sweet is good too. Our order came very fast.   This a walk-up-and-order restaurant with friendly service and charming minimalist, wood-themed decor. You can come as you are dressed, including T-shirts and shorts.   Cole slaw is an included side option and there are two kinds: creamy and spicy vinegar based. I got half and half, which is a great blend. Or you can get baked beans or potato salad. I did not find any of the food I had oversalted.    The housemade pickles remind me of those my grandpa used to make by soaking cucumber slices in cider vinegar and onions, so I love them.The cornbread is not a highlight, but it is included and a nice touch. The smoked meat was very good.   This will be one of our regular stops."}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever and I am from THE SOUTH! Orin and his team do it up right, treat you right and don't scrimp on the whipped cream for my namer puddin'"}
