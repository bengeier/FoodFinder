{"text":"I go to the Leopard about twice a year.  Always great service, never crowded, and a fine meal.  Nice touch with a complimentary appetizer sample.  Expensive, yes but not crazy.  The rack of lamb was outstanding, four double bone chops cooked medium rare as ordered.  Ask the server to split a salad as they are huge and very willing to do this.  The Caesar dala is great."}
{"text":"this leopard should change it's spots! My friend and I were there last night and our \"wonderful\" experience started with having to wait 10 minutes to be seated (in an almost empty restaurant!) was told there is never a hostess at the hostess stand. Sat down and ordered a cocktail and were given our menus and asked to make our selection. We asked for some time to enjoy our drinks. They brought our drinks and butter and chutney but no bread. After asking 3 times for bread was informed that they NEVER give bread until the meal is ordered. Our server then informed us at approx. 8:10 that we had to order our dinner because the chef has a family and wanted to be at home with them. I said it's date night that didn't seem to matter. We put it our order and it was brought promptly .... I think they chef had actually already left for the evening. They rewarmed a 1/2 a duck which in realty was a drumstick & a thigh and the salmon was so cold & dry it could have been used as a hockey puck! I wanted to order a glass of wine and there was no wine list and our server made suggestions... At this point I was afraid to tell them it wasn't great. To move us quicker out of the restaurant they offered us dessert to go... at 8:45 pm on a Saturday. I wouldn't have taken dessert if they paid me to... I don't know who at the PD thinks this is a 4 star restaurant. They need to revaluate!"}
{"text":"This is a fine-dining restaurant. The prices match what you might spend at L'Albatross, fire food and drink, Moxie, The Greenhouse Tavern or Lola. It is only fair then, that these are my frames of reference. I love food and eat at a different restaurant every week. What the top fine dining places always get right are: (1) an active, hip atmosphere, (2) food that is inventive and unique, served piping hot, (3) an meal experience worth talking about (4) excellent cooking techniques and creative use of novel ingredients that exceed expectations.  With that said, let's talk about Leopard here. For one, the atmosphere, for lack of a better word, felt \"tired\". I might be wrong, but it felt like the place was never updated since opening day and was stuck in the 80s. The music was played through what sounded like a boom box playing songs from an FM station.  I had ordered the veal chop. For comparison, the last veal chop that I had raved about was the one I had at Michaelangelo's in Little Italy. This one In Leopard, was plain-tasting and could have been seasoned or could have been paired with a reduction or sauce that might have brought out or enhanced the flavor. Biggest pet peeve is that, while it was served warm, other comparable places get it right by serving it piping hot, as a base standard.   Strengths: The staff was friendly and accommodating. Parking was easy. My son loved the leopard theme because he is aged 7 and loves animals. That's it pretty much.  The meal was not bad, but with this price range, folks will expect better and compare it to similarly priced places. I agree with the other poster. This is a local business and I want it to do well and succeed. Sigh. I so wanted this restaurant to be excellent and not just \"good\" because live close and it would have been awesome to come here often.  This place is attached to the hotel. The owners can settle on their captive audience of hotel guests and do fine, or step up their game, check the competition, come up with something equal or better and put Aurora on the culinary map."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife to celebrate a special occasion.  Got a discount certificate from restaurants.com.  i had heard a lot about this place and was interested in trying it out first hand.  The restaurant has an elegant ambiance.  Quiet, subdued lighting.  Courteous service.  They do start you with choice of water, OK, I settled for Aurora's finest tap.  The menu is short, but interesting.  Classic food, nothing trendy or adventurous.  We did not have soup, but had salads.  Both were interesting and flavorful.  Entrees were flavorful and portion size was generous.  Desserts were amazing, if you have room.  Nice selection of cheesecakes.  Wine list is extensive, but our first two choices were out of stock.  We were offered a non-listed bottle as a replacement, for the same price.  Allegedly, we were getting a deal, but I am a trusting soul.  Overall, elegant, nice experience with excellent service.  Food was good, but safe, and lacking a WOW factor that would give this five stars.  Yes they gave us a $25 gift certificate to return, and we probably will."}
{"text":"This is a fine dining restaurant with prices and service to match.  Our server was very good, gave us good information and was attentive.  Our food was served in fancy plates and bowls. I had the French Onion Soup and my partner had the Lobster Bisque.  Both were excellent and delivered to our table in a timely manner.  The rest of our dishes were good but did not 'wow' us as much as the soups which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I give Leopard a 4 star, the service by itself should be 5. Our server, Mark, is so excellent and I think he is the best in this area.  I only encounter better server in New Orleans.  The atmospheres and the décor are classic French restaurant.  It is suited for romantic and date dinning.  One more interesting fact, the female menu has no price. Your date will definitely impress.  No wonder they have been AAA 4 diamond award seven years on the roll.  Warning: reservation is must in the weekend and holiday.   When we first arrived, the manager seated us with a very comfortable tables, Mark offer us the choices of water (flat or sparkling).  He went through the large wine selection and he is very knowledgeable.  The helper offered a large selection of bread and different type of spreads (fresh house made jam, honey infused whipped butter).  It came the complimentary \"amuse bouche\" next.  My wife and I have order the French Onion and Lobster Bisque as opener.  Both soups are large portion and so phenomenal that my wife said it will be worth just come for the soups next time.  We order the crispy duck salad as second courses and the portion is large enough for both of us.  The duck is crispy and the goat cheeses are great.  My wife loved their vinaigrette dressing.   After the salad, it come a mango sorbet as complimentary intermezzo for cleaning our taste bud before the entrée.    I have the rack of lamb and my wife have crispy pheasant.  My lamb was cooked to perfection as I order (pink with a little blood).  However, my wife's crispy pheasant is over cook, but the sauce is tasty.  All the dish portions are so big that we have to pack both entrée home for lunch next day.  There is no room for dessert. When we asked for the check, Mark apologies for his slow services (I don't think so) and he offer us a $35 gift certificate for next time visit.  Next time we will try order less courses and will try their dessert.  However, the soup course is a must."}
